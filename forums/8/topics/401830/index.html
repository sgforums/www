              <p>Do you remember an old photo of a thunderbird/pterodactyl, nailed against a barn wall, with men standing in it for scale? So do many others (including myself). Thunderbirds are large giant flying birds seen over Texas and other parts of the world in current times and these birds once existed in those regions around 6000 years ago until they became extinct. They were known to science as Teratorns and are the last relatives of the modern condor and vulture. 100 of these fossils have been found</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I am very sure</span></strong> <strong>, i saw the picture in an old magazine series "Mysteries of the Unexplained"</strong></p>
              <p>Apparently it shows a large prehistoric bird or eagle known as "thunderbird" killed and pinned up. Below is a description of the pic</p>
              <p><img src="http://files.abovetopsecret.com/images/member/d0678a2dd295.jpg" alt="" width="702" height="484"></p>
              <p>(now pls dont go and google cause u will not find it , except for fakes).The Google searches have been done. Unless the image is scanned in on a page of a book online, the image is probably not on the internet. That's about what I was thinking, . The way you have a dream about a woman you don't know, and then see her the next day! Except there's a very real chance that you've altered your memory to accommodate the experience. Memory is a fluid thing. This mystery has been going on for decades and no one found the photograph. I think that a lot of people saw a bunch of weird photos that were extremely similar to the one described, and they're all getting confabulated together to become The One Missing Picture. I'm going to guess that there are lots of "this is the creature that pa found" photos that take place in a farm/barn setting, and apparently there are also some "giant bird creature" photos floating around.Ok, I know I just posted a few minutes ago, but geez… this is REALLY messing with me! I know I saw the picture, I know others have seen it as well. Why can’t we find it? I don’t know about you guys, but, this is nuts. Group false memory? I have no idea……..</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>So, how do we explain this weird phenomena of a photograph that so many remember seeing and yet no one can seem to find? Author Mark Hall believes that the description of the photo creates such a vivid image in the mind that many people who have a knowledge and an interest in curious and eclectic things begin to think the photo is familiar. It literally creates a "shared memory" of something that does not exist. We think we have seen it, but we actually have not.<br><br>To be honest, I can't say for sure if I agree with this or not. I can certainly see the possibility of a "memory" like this that we have created from inside of our own overcrowded minds, but then again, what if the photo does exist and it's out there, just waiting to be discovered in some dusty garage, overflowing file cabinet or musty basement. I, for one, haven't given up quite yet - and I have a feeling that I am not the only one who is still out there looking.<br><br>But are thunderbirds and mysterious flying creatures actually real? Do they fill the skies of anything other than our imaginations? If not, then what have so many people seen over the years? At this point, such creatures remain a mystery but one thing is sure, the sightings have continued over the years and occasionally an unusual report still trickles in from somewhere across America. So keep that in mind the next time that you are standing in an open field and a large, dark shadow suddenly fills the sky overhead. Was that just a cloud passing in front of the sun - or something else??</p></div>
