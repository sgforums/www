            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes its just so hard to find people to talk seriously about life, I don't mean like talk about your own life, I mean where life comes from? People just don't take you seriously about it. Stuff like...<br><br>What do you want to do in life?<br><br>Don't you think we are just insignificant beings on this huge earth, and even more insignificant compared to the rest of the galaxy and beyond?<br><br>Do you believe in fate? If you do, don't you think its just a piece of crap that we live to live out our destiny that has already been paved out for us, and in some religions, even get punished in the after life for the bad deeds we've done when we have no control over our life in the first place as its already been written down black and white?<br><br>Do you believe in religions? How do you take it then? If the so called upper being created us, did he or she or whatever also created the galaxy also? Since most religion also related to earth and only earth, but the fact is that the galaxy outside us is so wide and deep. Why worship this specific upper being when that is most probably another upper being that created this upper being?<br><br>Ever wondered who or what created us? Ever wonder who or what created the being that created us and so on? There must be a start, but before the start, there must be something to start out the start which in turn has something else to start it off.<br><br>Why reproduce? When we are eventually going to die out anyway.<br><br>There are just so many more things I can think of, but no one seems to take me seriously enough.</div>
