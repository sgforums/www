            <div class='col-md body'>I too do not understand why anyone should still want to go to JB.  If someone were to tell you that a particular river is infested with crocodiles,  would you still want to swim in it?  Why risk you life and limbs just to save $$$$?  How much can you save and is it worth the risks?  Those who still choose to go there and then get mugged, deserves it.</div>
