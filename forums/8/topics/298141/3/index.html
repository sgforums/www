So what if you retain? there are lots of ppl who retain and they are still successful ppl. You will never knows what happen next , study hard and get into poly. You know , if you really listens to others advise , you are really a filled cup , if someone dosent listens , then he is just like a broken cup , even if u keep pouring in water , it will still drip out and will never be filled , i hope you get what i meant.</div>

So for me i prefer alive thing , rather than a dead body , so if i prefer something , of course i will find it easier to comprehend and understand right? Maybe once you have entered poly or taking private courses , you will know the difference between courses and dead studying. Because i don't really know how to say it. It's not that my diploma courses is easier than n lvl.</div>

And i got really angry that time , when i actually appealed to retain , and the teacher just tell me straight in my face , "go ITE , u can't even pass your N lvl , what for still want to come back?" and he is the teacher who say those who fail n lvl is a retarded. and yeah most of my classmate did not went back for what he said , even some pass with like 8 to 10 pts. and now they are all doing well. Other teachers also look down on us saying , if you guys is not retarded then show us , you can do well in your exam and throw your stupid result in our face to let us see. is that how the way they shld talk? they dont talk like this to the other class , somemore they encourage them a lot.</div></blockquote>If your teachers had not said that, would you have felt angry and swear to prove them wrong?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> You must thank them for inspiring you... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
