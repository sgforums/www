But i got a private diploma now , and now i am taking advanced diploma and after my ns i am going to australia to take my degree. I am taking sports management right now , and i am going to take my degree in sports management in australia. From here , i have prove to the teachers that they are wrong , we are just not academically-inclined , and most of my friends now are doing very well in ITE. And they are all working hard ton get into poly. For other normal academic classes in my school , they are still waiting for their result , but from what i see , there will be more ppl who will end up failing their o lvls. cos my school , they are more biased against the first 2 classes of normal academic , and they don't care about the 3rd class of normal academic as there are 3 classes of normal academic class in my school. So those who fail their N lvl , pls do not think , ur world already ends , and that u got no more future , let me tell u guys , this is just the beginning of the chapter of your life , your future will be bright if you work hard. good luck to u guys.</div></blockquote>Steady la....should be motivated!<br><br>People learn at different speed.

If private cert are of no use , then what for people open private school? and somemore , mine is sports management , only RP and ITE have those course, u seen any other sch that give sports mgt? and pls dun say nyp cos they are sports &amp; wellness totally different. I saved a lot of time in private. Its a shorter route. whereas poly is more of a longer route. Yes their cert is more recognise. But in terms of maturality , private still have better advantage. We study hard for private , because it's expensive , that is one thing , SOME ppl in poly just take it for granted and don't study hard , and i mean SOME , so don't get the wrong idea about me saying ALL the poly students and start flaming me. MDIS cert is becoming more recognise now , although i am not from MDIS , but i seen private student earning big bucks , and much more money than those mainstream people. From what i see , more private school are developing and who knows? they might even outrun the mainstream schools like JCs and poly , It's just that mainstream got govt support , but not for private schools. and please , my school is endorse by singapore sports council and some other private sector. And some company recognise our cert. What you know is only about mainstream school , please do a research on private school and compare them.</div>

Guys here , if you only got a O lvl cert which cant get you to poly , then going to private school to further your education is one way. =)) good luck!</div>
