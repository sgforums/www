            <div class='col-md body'>if our class cannot pass our n lvl then we are a retarded , yeah i admit i failed my n lvl , i got 11 points , cos i dont study at all and even if i study , i know i also wont make it in sec 5. But i got a private diploma now , and now i am taking advanced diploma and after my ns i am going to australia to take my degree. I am taking sports management right now , and i am going to take my degree in sports management in australia. From here , i have prove to the teachers that they are wrong , we are just not academically-inclined , and most of my friends now are doing very well in ITE. And they are all working hard ton get into poly. For other normal academic classes in my school , they are still waiting for their result , but from what i see , there will be more ppl who will end up failing their o lvls. cos my school , they are more biased against the first 2 classes of normal academic , and they don't care about the 3rd class of normal academic as there are 3 classes of normal academic class in my school. So those who fail their N lvl , pls do not think , ur world already ends , and that u got no more future , let me tell u guys , this is just the beginning of the chapter of your life , your future will be bright if you work hard. good luck to u guys.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thanks guys , i really did work hard for my diploma although its only a private diploma , but the exams were not really very easy , one qns i wrote about 4 pages of answers , althought its not a lot , but i really tried my best and do it. and i really study very hard for it. And i got really angry that time , when i actually appealed to retain , and the teacher just tell me straight in my face , "go ITE , u can't even pass your N lvl , what for still want to come back?" and he is the teacher who say those who fail n lvl is a retarded. and yeah most of my classmate did not went back for what he said , even some pass with like 8 to 10 pts. and now they are all doing well. Other teachers also look down on us saying , if you guys is not retarded then show us , you can do well in your exam and throw your stupid result in our face to let us see. is that how the way they shld talk? they dont talk like this to the other class , somemore they encourage them a lot.</div>

From here , i have prove to the teachers that they are wrong , we are just not academically-inclined , and most of my friends now are doing very well in ITE. And they are all working hard ton get into poly. For other normal academic classes in my school , they are still waiting for their result , but from what i see , there will be more ppl who will end up failing their o lvls. cos my school , they are more biased against the first 2 classes of normal academic , and they don't care about the 3rd class of normal academic as there are 3 classes of normal academic class in my school. So those who fail their N lvl , pls do not think , ur world already ends , and that u got no more future , let me tell u guys , this is just the beginning of the chapter of your life , your future will be bright if you work hard. good luck to u guys.</div></blockquote>Yeah, go do Sports Management... Come back open gym or be a trainer, then earn big bucks ok?</div>

Just let the comments that your teacher lay to rest. He is just being narrow minded.<br><br>I'm from the Normal Academic Stream previously. Most of the teachers in school did give us a 2nd glance. We did not give a shitz either.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Yes you are correct that you start a new chapter in your life. But remember is your own actions and determination will mould whom you are.<br><br>Some of my closest friends since then have become architects,private bankers with leading foreign banks, Consultants &amp; engineers with leading American MNCs.<br><br>Have fun studing !</div>
