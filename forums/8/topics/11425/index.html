No compensation will be paid with respect to Microsoft's use of the materials contained within such communication.<br><br>After the eFront debacle, we're baffled why anyone would want to trust confidential communications to any of the big IM services, let alone MSN Messenger.<br><br>Apple originally launched its iDisk service with a similar landgrab, but was quickly forced to retreat.<br><br>As reader Ken points out, 'All Your Data Belong To Us'.

            <div class='col-md body'>Unfortunately, yes. To form a contract, all we need is offer, acceptance and intention to create legal intentions. When we click I agree, its almost unarguable that a contract ahs been formed.<br><br>Yet, regarding the terms and conditions of this contract, there is a possiblility of us winning over it. Although the terms and conditions are pretty well incorporated and well constructed, there is a statute in Singapore - the Unfair Contract Terms Act and an equivalent one in the States that tests the reasonableness of the terms and conditions in the contract.<br><br>One thing that I am not very sure of is which legislature will rule the Internet. Singapore (our internet laws are very underdeveloped), the States or some International Laws.<br><br>I believe that Microsoft will not really monitor the messages of us, the small fries. If they do, goodnes knows how many bo-liao messages are they going to view in their course of business operation. LOL</div>
