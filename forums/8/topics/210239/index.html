            <div class='col-md body'>I have known this girl karen* for more then 3 years already through my ex-gf.(karen &amp; my ex are gd frenz). All along, me &amp; karen can click with each other quite well and are gd Bro/ Sis relationship.<br><br>Ever since i broke with my ex, i feel that me and karen are getting closer and closer though we seldom talk on the phone. We mainly will meet up to chit chat or have meals together if we got time. Unknowingly, i developed some feelings for her. However my ex still pins for me to return to her side. I feel this is the main obstrucle between us. Moreover karen claim we r juz bro &amp; sis mah so being close is ok and not 'jian bu de guan'.<br><br>Until 2 days ago, me and karen went to a esplanade(close to the sea) and chit chat for a few hours. For the first time, she lean her back towards me while sitting down and rest her head on my shoulder. I really feel happy when she does that as my feelings for her grew. Then just yesterday she jio me to beach to walk walk as she long time never been there already. So after dinner, we stroll down the beach and enjoy the cool breeze.<br><br>After some time, we sat down onto a beach. She started resting her head on my shoulders, chest(listening to my fast heart beat), and even lap while she rested her eyes. I sang some songs to her softly, tell her stories, stroking her hair,eyes,lips, etc etc. In the siting position, i even sling my hands around her neck and rested on her stomach(touching her @@) as a result. Passbyers who passed by us will definitely think we r a loving couple. The time we spent there was very enjoyable.<br><br>The thing is i doesn't know she got feelings for me or not or just treating me as a good kor kor. Can good friends spent their time together as what i had have described? I not so sure... she told me she got lie her head briefly on one other guy(whom she got no feelings but gd frenz) and her ex. So i dunno what her actions meant... Can anyone(esp gals) enlighten me on this? Thanks a million.

All along, me &amp; karen can click with each other quite well and are gd Bro/ Sis relationship.<br><br>Ever since i broke with my ex, i feel that me and karen are getting closer and closer though we seldom talk on the phone. We mainly will meet up to chit chat or have meals together if we got time. Unknowingly, i developed some feelings for her. However my ex still pins for me to return to her side. I feel this is the main obstrucle between us. Moreover karen claim we r juz bro &amp; sis mah so being close is ok and not 'jian bu de guan'.<br><br>Until 2 days ago, me and karen went to a esplanade(close to the sea) and chit chat for a few hours. For the first time, she lean her back towards me while sitting down and rest her head on my shoulder. I really feel happy when she does that as my feelings for her grew. Then just yesterday she jio me to beach to walk walk as she long time never been there already. So after dinner, we stroll down the beach and enjoy the cool breeze.<br><br>After some time, we sat down onto a beach. She started resting her head on my shoulders, chest(listening to my fast heart beat), and even lap while she rested her eyes. I sang some songs to her softly, tell her stories, stroking her hair,eyes,lips, etc etc. In the siting position, i even sling my hands around her neck and rested on her stomach(touching her @@) as a result. Passbyers who passed by us will definitely think we r a loving couple. The time we spent there was very enjoyable.<br><br>The thing is i doesn't know she got feelings for me or not or just treating me as a good kor kor. Can good friends spent their time together as what i had have described? I not so sure... she told me she got lie her head briefly on one other guy(whom she got no feelings but gd frenz) and her ex. So i dunno what her actions meant... Can anyone(esp gals) enlighten me on this? Thanks a million.

I can imagine two most possible results out of many:<br><br>1. She answered, "Yes, I have feelings for you." Then milkmilk reply by a deep hug then happy ending.<br><br>2. She answered, "I treat you like a brother." Then milkmilk reply, "Ok." and carry on let her lean against him.<br><br>O_o</div>
