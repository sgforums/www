            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm, it's common loh. When one has a gf/bf, they will tend to spend time together. It's NOT that your friends want to neglect you for their gf/bf but they also find it hard to fork out the time and to balance it out. As friends, we must be understanding. A godo idea will be going out with the couple as a group with other friends. A double date is a godo idea too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>=================================<br>Do Pixies like a rainy day?<br>A-piping through the dell?<br>The Pixies must enjoy the rain;<br>Thats when they weave their spell.<br>Rain drops, rain drops<br>Play a Pixie-tune<br>=================================</div>

We can not do anything about it, just face it.  This make you feel that your friend does not take you all as top priorities and this may make you a wee bit jealous, thus spurring you to have a girlfriend, to go find your miss right.  I guess we have one in our forum who have it in the signature that clearly explains it.....keep a look out for fellow forumites and you may find some reassurance you are not the only one...<br><br>------------------<br>Nothing can't be done, unless you don't want to</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>this is not really pampering or doting on, but things i have done for a girl i loved:<br><br>1. when her dog went missing i helped her search for it. we couldn't find it. unknown to her, i also came back after midnight and drove round her estate to look for it, even tho i hate driving at nights. it turned out safe and sound the next morning, thankfully not under my wheel.<br><br>2. when she has a problem and calls me at work, i talk to her even when my director is screaming her head off for some piece of work. i always put her before any and all work. and i call her back as soon as i can if i can't talk straight away.<br><br>3. when she calls me at all times of the morning and all times of the night (and this happens a whole lot) i always talk to her and listen to her problems, whether or not there is soccer on tv, whether there are just five minutes to go and i'll miss the ending of the show, or even if i'm dead tired and i need to sleep or i am asleep. i lend a listening ear whenever she needs to grumble. and a shoulder to cry on too.<br><br>4. i went at lunch time and after work to visit her when she was sick in some hospital on the other side of the earth. and she wasn't even my gf. and i didn't have a car. took public transport and walked all the way to the hospital (and it was quite a distance) come rain or shine or whether i was tired or sick or had an early day the next day. this happened for a while. she was in and out of the hospital for a bit.<br><br>5. prayed every single day for 3 years that her mother would recover from some medical problem. she has. pray every single night for abt 20 minutes that my girl will be okay in life.<br><br>6. she's afraid to go out with me sometimes. cos when she sees something she likes, it ends up as a present for no occasion at all or for a special occasion all wrapped up in ribbons. i don't look at the price when i buy things for her. and i usu wrap it myself. ahem. pathetic tho my wrapping is. and she gets more than one present (dresses, gowns, jewellery, books, cd-players, etc) for every occasion. and flowers too.<br><br>7. called and talked and wrote to her often when she was overseas.<br><br>8. give her support (moral, emotional, monetary) thru all her zany plans in life and be there for her when her plans don't quite work out.<br><br>9. stand up for her when frens don't approve of the things she's done.<br><br>10. make her feel good abt herself when she feels fat or ugly.<br><br>11. shop with her even tho i don't really want to.<br><br>12. seriously considered converting to a particular religion for her.<br><br>13. remember all the special moments and anniversaries we've had. i made this scrapbook for her that had the tickets and receipts of all the movies we've watched, restaurants we've dined in from the first day we met, the last ice-cream stick she ate from before she had to go abroad, bottle-caps, love-notes, etc. also printed out and kept two years' worth of daily email correspondence with her when we were working - to remember us by and the moments we've shared, all the ups and downs.<br><br>14. helped her in her work when she didn't quite know how to go abt it and was getting crap from her bosses.<br><br>15. whenever i could get hold of the car i fetched her around. and even when i didn't have the car, i sent her home everytime we went out.<br><br>16. let her ogle at other men cos she ogles at women too.<br><br>17. let her know how beautiful she is, tho she tells me i'm deluded.<br><br>18. never say a thing or feel embarrassed abt her sometimes bizarre dress sense.<br><br>19. eat the food she cooks. hahaha!<br><br>20. massage her feet when she's tired.<br><br>21. give her space when she needs it.<br><br>22. listen to her when she insists i use lip-gloss and sun-block.<br><br>23. scold her when she needs to be scolded.<br><br>24. love her even when she doesn't need to be loved.<br><br>25. send her off to bed with randy thoughts of us.<br><br>26. talk to her every night before she sleeps, even when i'm out with frens.<br><br>27. shelve all other plans if i know she needs me to be with her. i have always done that.<br><br>28. never do what she doesn't like me doing.<br><br>29. never let another girl into my heart.<br><br>30. let her go when she decided she loved someone else more.<br><br>before you start thinking that this is a list of what a guy should do for a girl, it is not. it is just some things that a stupid guy like me would do. and what i have done. there are prob more things but i can't rem them now. but i don't think i'll ever do anything like this again. someone told me i do too much for girls i love. i am starting to think so too. so plse, try never to give all of your heart to someone. you never know what they may do with it.<br><br></div>

to remember us by and the moments we've shared, all the ups and downs.<br><br>14. helped her in her work when she didn't quite know how to go abt it and was getting crap from her bosses.<br><br>15. whenever i could get hold of the car i fetched her around. and even when i didn't have the car, i sent her home everytime we went out.<br><br>16. let her ogle at other men cos she ogles at women too.<br><br>17. let her know how beautiful she is, tho she tells me i'm deluded.<br><br>18. never say a thing or feel embarrassed abt her sometimes bizarre dress sense.<br><br>19. eat the food she cooks. hahaha!<br><br>20. massage her feet when she's tired.<br><br>21. give her space when she needs it.<br><br>22. listen to her when she insists i use lip-gloss and sun-block.<br><br>23. scold her when she needs to be scolded.<br><br>24. love her even when she doesn't need to be loved.<br><br>25. send her off to bed with randy thoughts of us.<br><br>26. talk to her every night before she sleeps, even when i'm out with frens.<br><br>27. shelve all other plans if i know she needs me to be with her. i have always done that.<br><br>28. never do what she doesn't like me doing.<br><br>29. never let another girl into my heart.<br><br>30. let her go when she decided she loved someone else more.<br><br>before you start thinking that this is a list of what a guy should do for a girl, it is not. it is just some things that a stupid guy like me would do. and what i have done. there are prob more things but i can't rem them now. but i don't think i'll ever do anything like this again. someone told me i do too much for girls i love. i am starting to think so too. so plse, try never to give all of your heart to someone. you never know what they may do with it.<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>But sometimes when u realise even u do all these things to her, she doesn't return them to u n just treats u normally, will u still do it? Perhaps I'm too practical, but I tend to lose hope when I don't see any reactions and things go downhill... and it is very SAD.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey if everything you do is something u are expecting to get back that it is not love anymore. Love is unconditional and it might sounds stupid but it is how it is..to give is a joy and to receive is a blessing..hmm wonder how many ppl really understand alll these...<br><br>To come to the all what Ray has done is certainly not easy especially the gal is not even his gf..sigh... Is that what Life is all about? All the so called good guys are being neglected and the bad guys gets alll the attention and credit..It is a sad sad world!</div>
