            <div class='col-md body'>One terrible thing that your galfen A should never do again is to go out or talk SECRETLY to other guys. Best advice to her if she really love her stead is to keep thing clear between her and the other guy friends. Letting these guy friends know her feeling towards her stead so that these guys will know their stand instead of having a false hope that they might get any chance with her. When meeting the guys, never meet individual alone and preferably sometime drag her bf along in group outing instead. Introducing her bf to them would be the best way to test out these guys.<br><br>You see, most guy treat a ger well for some extra reason more than just normal friend. I'm not implying that your galfren A should avoid making friend with her other guy friends but by testing out and letting them know their stand, only those sincere friend will stay while the rest will just go off.<br><br>As for the stead, best advice for him is to have more trust in his galfren A and have more confidence in himself instead of being over protective. He should build himself up instead of being too sensitive and insecure. 1stly, he's still young but should get mature enuff to worry for their future instead of fearing lost of his gf.<br>A relationship at the later stage will be different esp when the guy got to go for NS.<br>He should work hard to secure his own future, career and gain confidence in order to maintain a relationship.<br><br>Tell me is there any future between your galfren A and her stead if the stead is a good-for-nothing ah-beng on the street who care only about wooing girl, having fun and squandering $$$? If that's the case for A's stead, then tell her get to know more potential guy friend cos in reality, most sensible girl will never be able to spend the rest of her life with such a guy even if you argue that the girl really love the guy.</div>
