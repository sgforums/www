            <div class='col-md body'>keke. Let's see if anyone can explain the answer to the following question..hehe<br><br>Formula from our textbooks: Stress (N/m*m)= force (N) / area (m*m), where Stress is the force exerting on the area of contact.<br><br>So if one have a perfect sphere sitting on a perfect flat surface, the sphere touches the flat surface only at one single point, is equalivant to saying the the area of contact approaches zero. Because the one single point is so so so so so small.<br><br>hence stress = force / 0  or a very very small number (0.000000000000001). meaning stress becomes very very very big for a fix force.<br><br>Hence am I right to say as stress approaches infinity and if apply to real life everything will disintegrate?

Both surfaces are definately able to withstand the stress apply to that particular point without changing it's physical shape. SO the more accurate the machining, the more accurate the sphere, the smaller the area of contact the larger stress....hence shouldn't all accurate instruments "disintegrate"?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am surprised so much has been discussed without giving consideration to how strain actually helps to "cushion" the stress.<br><br>To illustrate this point, imagine a rectangular block of plasticine(for the sake of this example, let's assume its density is uniformly distributed). When stress is applied, what normally results would be a decrease in the height (ie.the dimension between the point where the external force is applied and the side of the plasticine in contact with the ground) of the plasticine, but the length and width (ie.it will become longer by the sides) would actually increase to "cushion" this external force.<br><br>Hence, that probably explains why your matter (plasticine in this case) will not collapse at a heap as Strain = Stress/Young's Modulus. As Darkness has already mentioned, the factors that determine the durability(ie.for how long it will conform to the principles as determined by your equation denoting stress) of an object have many possibilities - from atmospheric pressure to the density and Young's modulus of an object. As you can imagine from the above example given, should the stress be excessively greater than the permissible Young's modulus, what happens would result in the plasticine becoming totally flat(ie.height --&gt; 0) with its length and width lengthened greatly...<br><br>Hope that clarifies the concept.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
