            <div class='col-md body'>Lex .... dun mind but how old r u now? I mean then u r 15..... guess the police force then and now is totally different lor.....i am sure nowsaday even a 15 yrs old know how to lodge a complaint, thus don't think any police officers on the street dare to do it now. Anyway, hey, at least it prove that u look good already, even at the age of 15. But then u sound very upset abt it ..... how come? think u should not get upset by just over 1 incident..........<br><br>Anyway, heard from a firned in the police force that the SPF is unlike the army, they are not located as much money to buy arms as army. The main point is army needs to keep up with the best with the rest of the world just in case of war. But then, don't think u will ever get to see s'pore police officer fighting against country X police officer rite? The purpose of the revolver is for self protection. Thus, there's really no point in upgrading as yet.<br><br>Who says that the .38 revolver look 'un-garang'? Any brave 1 ard dare to try it?<br><br></div>

Maybe only the CID officers and of course the STAR unit. For the regular police, a normal police baton (or two!) should be good enough to handle most situations.<br><br>I'm sure you guys have read in the papers not a few times about a suspect snatching the policeman's gun during a struggle? About how the cord that attaches the gun to the hoslter got broken? It's really a joke when you think about it. And sometimes the poor policeman gets shot by his own gun? What's the gun for?

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe those who really suspect the ability of the police officers ought to try putting all the radio set, handcuff, revolver etc. on the belt and try running........ i am sure it will be a totally different feeling. think many pple here feel that its easy, well that's becos u never tried it ....... as for me, had some friends in the force ........ heard many stories. know how they feel when they gave chase. Also, u think the police officers are in shorts and track shoe? No....they are in pants and with boots......<br><br>And personally, i think its not fair to compare a fleeding drug addict with a chasing officer ........ one is running for his life.....i mean if yr life is in danger, i am sure u will run hell a lot faster then u usually do, dun u agree? so its simply not fair ...... anyway do u know that offender, esp drug addicts are the dangerous? as they do not have much feeling after taking the drugs......i mean, trying fighting with them n u will know.<br><br>Police officers are also human ...... spare a thought for them, gave them some credits....... i mean, didn't they do a not so bad job now in s'pore to prevent crime?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Do remember if the SPF spend the $$$ to upgrade their weapons system, where do U think the money will come from and who will end up paying it? The answer is simple as SPF got their funding from the govt. who gets their funds from the taxes ppl pay.<br><br>Another qn is is the really a need to upgrade? I myself think not as chances of really getting to use the gun is limited and the .38 is enough for the SPF to carry out their duties. Do remember that there is the possiblity that if the SPF upgrade to more powerful weapons, the crimmials who come here  to rob etc and who wants to use a gun will choose one that is more powerful so as to beat the police. Thus do remember that if SPF upgrade, the crimmials may do the same. And in the future we may see robbers using grenades, M16, AK47, LAW, MG instead of knife, parang or the occasional .38 revolver. If that happens, this will be a warzone liao. So I think if the need to upgrade is not there, don't upgrade.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I must voice out my opinion, if not I'll feel very bad down there...<br><br>First of all, talking about upgrading the old, old revolver on our blue guys belt. How many of you guys here actually see gun shoot-outs on the streets and extremely life-threatening situations where terrorists are trying to takeover Singapore??? If the scenario happens, our guys in blue carrying .38 S&amp;W on their waists are courting deaths...<br><br>However, we have our very own elite STAR Unit armed to the teeth wif MP5s. Unless the terrorist group is so well-organised, any 'would-be' terrorist-cum-Rambo would definitely be no match for STAR Unit. So, wat's the point of upgrading the Smith and Wessons?? It's like spending millions of dollars on something that you hardly (probably never) get to use in your entire lifetime!!!<br><br>Our boys-in-blue running?? It's not simple, u know?? Whilst we guys-in-green clear SOC wif SBO-Helmet-Rifle, our boys-in-blue have equipment strapped to their WAIST and chasing criminals!!!! :0<br><br>Can u imagine a Policeman chasing a criminal and all those equipment bouncing up and down on his waist?? As though he didn't have to worry not catching the bad-guy, he still has to worry about his pants dropping!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Try a little experiment, put your handphone on your trousers belt, your big fat wallet in your back pocket, your bunch of keys in yur pockets and TRY a 100m sprint to catch that bus, which u'll be late 4 work if u miss it!!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The is regarding moose mail. I do agree with U but there is always the possibility. Having strict laws does not mean crimminals will not use firearms. Take drug traffickers for instant. If caught, they may face death sentence. Thus they will not mind having firearms. And of coz they will try to get the best they can afford and at least try to be better than the polices'.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh yah, adding on something ....... ever wonder what will happen to the police officers if during a chase he dropped his radio set and spoilt it, or dropped some bullets? The consequences is heavy ....... but then, i am sure police officers still gave those crooks a good chase everytime.</div>
