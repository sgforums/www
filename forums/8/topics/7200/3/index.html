            <div class='col-md body'>To some extent I'd go along with susantml's point of view. If the policeman's job is to run after a criminal, he better damned well do a good job of it. Lives are at stake after all. Or else why bother getting himself all tired and sweaty if he's most likely going to lose the race anyway?<br><br>If it's so difficult to run with all that equipment on the waist, then surely there must be something wrong with the uniform and the placement of all that equipment. My impression is that the uniform is acceptably smart but looks rather impractical - it's so tight I can't imagine anyone running in it for any distance.<br><br>Having said that, I wonder how often our men in blue lose in the 'races'?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>haha thks for asking but normally when we do chase after people, we seldom let them run away as we normally seek out people in numbers.<br>and if we do drop anything and at the end of the day, we cant get it back<br>we would just have to pay for it if we do not have a very good reason for it<br>so sometimes u see police men picking up things which they drop while chasing so thats why loh</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hie...me a newbie...well just wanna add that i hv a fren who is in the volunteer police force and she was saying that the standard is really low. She has a colleague who is middle-aged, fat and has a huge beer belly. i tink he looks more at ease spending his nites at the kopi shops drinking beer than stuffing himself into the blu uniform and chasing after criminals. Somemore, her instructor told her that they shld run away if the situation gets nasty...hmmm...makes one wonder how at ease you are supposed to feel?<br><br>------------------<br>oh well, whatever, never mind...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The police force have always stressed that when chasing after suspects... there must be at least 2 officers. Anyway... even if the suspect ran away, he will be traced down easily as Singapore is not very big. Of course if the suspect is dangerous... I think officers will try all means to ensure his arrest.</div>

C'mon...What happened to all that unarmed combat training?  True that Mace or Pepperspray may not be affective against some but it would slow the attacker down one or two steps at least.<br><br>Secondly, 2 cops against 1 person...hmmm... don't they train police on disarming a suspect?  Must fire 4 shots? Obviously they ARE triggerhappy....<br><br>Besides, if they're armed with batons, they can protect themselves in close quarters as well without endagering life and limb.<br><br>There is a gap in their training somewhere... in a country where gun laws are strict and gun related crimes are 0 for the past 4 years, police firing live rounds (be it HP bullets or otherwise) at a suspect for charging at them with a iron rod is excessive and therefore, I call that triggerhappiness.<br><br>------------------<br>To err is human;<br>to really screw up, you need a computer</div>
