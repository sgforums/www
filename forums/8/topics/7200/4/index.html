            <div class='col-md body'>A 61-cm iron pipe can be a dangerous weapon. With the correct force, it can crack skulls and break bones.<br><br>True the police had some unarmed combat training, but their main concern here is to stop the threat than to practice their unarmed combat training on someone with an iron rod.<br><br>The iron rod was raised, had the police officer decide to use unarmed combat, all that the assailant could do is to strike down.<br><br>Until Singapore police officers are issued pepperspray, lets stick to what they are equipped with. Using baton to protect themselves doesn't stop the threat, and they are now equipped with telescopic batons rather than the long wooden ones. These batons are not designed to withstand impact from an iron rod.<br><br>They might be trained to disarm ppl, but they are also trained to assess situation. In this case, a man ready to assault and hurt. They only disarm when the potential assailant do not pose an immediate threat or the officer is confident that disarming him/her would not cause hurt to anyone (including the assailant).<br><br>As for 2 officers versus 1 man, again I have to repeat that their main priority is to stop threat immediately.<br>2 men versus a later-identified as a mental patient may not be sufficient to stop the threat to neutralise the threat. (There was once where it took 9 officers to pin down a man high on drugs. And another case 10 bullets to kill someone just high on adrenaline)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm...10 bullets....<br><br>Obviously the police are triggerhappy.  Either that, or they are very poor shots.<br><br>Yes, an iron rod can cause grevious hurt. But then again, like you said, the guy was a mental patient.  True, the policeman did not know it at the time. But shooting once at the raised arm can cause the suspect to drop the weapon.<br><br>Telescopic batons cannot withstand the impact of an iron rod.  True, but are the police so static that they don't know how to dodge?<br><br>It still doesn't justify the use of excessive force.  Firing more than 2 shots at a suspect is considered excessive force.  Like I said, they did not have to use lethal force.<br><br>Police put their lives at stake everyday to protect us.  I agree that it can be a very stressful job.  I respect police officers but there are times when their use of force cannot be justified.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Anyway, non of us were really there to see the situation for ourselves first-hand so I guess it is debatable as to what really happened.  However, I feel that police in Singapore should be given proper training, and a means of protecting themselves without harming others.  Afterall, it is to serve and protect.<br><br>In the US, they have tested many non-lethal weapons.  Here's some of them that they ought to consider:<br><br>1) Shotguns that fire bean-bags.<br>2) Shotguns that fire nets<br>3) Rubberised bullets that do not penetrate<br>4) Stun guns (Electric - although this is a close quarters weapon)<br>5) Mace and pepperspray<br>6) Telescopic batons with electric stun<br><br>But all things considered, the police are doing a good job just by showing their presence.<br><br>------------------<br>To err is human;<br>to really screw up, you need a computer<br><br>[This message has been edited by GoonDu (edited 19 May 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yep 10 bullets, shows what the power of adrenaline. 2 other cases where adrenaline do wonders.<br><br>One where a failed robbing attempt left the robber shot in the stomach, he managed to flee only to die later of his own wounds some 300-400 meters away.<br><br>The other, where a man shot on the jaw could still flee chasing cops and drive pretty well only to be stopped by spike-strips.<br><br>ANyway...back to our topic, I dun think there should be a clear boundary where anything above 2 shots is excessive. I would only consider excessive force IF, the police officer shot additional rounds even after threat was neutralised (eg, assailant was down, or disarmed)<br><br>In this case, the situation after the first 2 shots was still the same as if no shots were fired.<br><br>Ok, we shall stop here and discuss further in the other more appropriatedly titled thread.<br><br>As for the non-lethal weapons...<br><br>Bean-bags were used before and sometimes successfully. But there was one case in Seattle where it failed to have any effect on a mentally ill man brandishing a kantana. He was only subdued later with a high-pressure water cannon.<br><br>I have personally been shot by one, but at much lower impact (350 feet per second). Left a bruise for few days but the impact was enuff to give you a nasty shock.<br><br>Nets were tested repeatedly but were not used as they found results are not consistent and unpredictable.<br><br>Rubberised bullets do penetrate at close range. Making police liable to using excessive force.<br><br>Stun guns, I dunno if they are in general use already. But in my opinion, their ease of usage and incapcitating effect could be dangerous to the cops themselves.<br><br>Mace and pepperspray. Widely used.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I dunno.....<br><br>I mean, taking what I know from playing Multiplayer games around, no matter what superior weapon you have, you can STILL get killed by something a lot inferior......<br><br>I mean, like, say, CounterStrike.... you can be armed with the best weapon in the freaking game, and your assailiant can be armed with just a simple knife. Sure, you can shoot him to try to stop him from getting to you, but if the fella's deranged/mad with pain/anger, and stabs the knife in your throat/eye/skull even when he's shot.....<br><br>Its game over for the guy with the gun.<br><br>The same for a metal bar.... some people don't have thick skulls full of calcium you know, and one simple swing of a nice, thick metal bar at the head at the right angle can also make it a Game over for almost anyone. I mean, people can die from just falling off a chair, much less a direct hit on the head from a metal bar....<br><br>The inbuilt instinct for survival is too ingrained in Humans. I mean, would any one of us bother to say, drop the gun, and take on an opponent with a weapon with our bare hands ? Even if we're martial artists, but have no actual combat experience ? or even talk it out, and not attempt to fight to survive against a person who's practically outright hostile ? (In all outward appearances anyway.)<br><br>Then again, what the heck do I know....
