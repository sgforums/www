So as long as u're good, nothing else will be able to stop u<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by kindaichi83:</div><div class="quote_body">NUS is the worst uni ever.<br><br>Not on it's academic values but on how they look down on poly grads..<br><br>I'm a poly grad and I was lucky that my results qualifies me for places in local uni... but both gave me places in coz that are not my desired coz... feel that they are dumping me... don't mind it at 1st until I realised what they did to my friends..<br><br>My friends... both top 3 in my coz (chemical engineering) could not get a place in NUS... I mean my friend's results are over the top.... and even Imperial College (one of England's top uni) accepted them.. yet NUS being a lowly rank in the world rejected them.. just becoz they are from poly.. stupid.. they will regret losing my friends to NTU.<br><br>And they refused to give me any exemptions for my coz (Chemistry) even though I have did some of the modules in my poly days.. Unis in Oz are more than happy to give me 2 yrs exemptions... if I can complete a uni education in 2 yrs.. why should I complete it in 4 yrs and what's more.... a coz that I do not really want.. but got dump into....<br><br>I got so fed up that I decided I will not want to go NUS if possible.... hopefully.. can  go overseas when at least I'm treated like 1st class students not like NUS.. accepted me becoz they need to fill up the places... </div></blockquote></div>
