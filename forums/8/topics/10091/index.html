            <div class='col-md body'>Terrorists were reported to have invaded the POW stronghold and to have taken several hostages. The terrorists were reportedly from various parts of the world, including the middle-eastern L337 Krew and the Gorilla Warface, the Eastern European Phoenix Connection and the Swedish Arctic Avengers.<br><br>He chose to join the elite British SAS because he liked their dark-colored uniforms. He also thought it served nicely as a camouflage that would allow him to blend into the darkness.<br><br>Upon receiving the news of the terrorist attack, an international counter-terrorist team was formed immediately. He was part of that team, which also included the US Seal Team, the French GIGN and the German GSG-9 forces. There was no time for planning strategy - the lives of the hostages were threatened with every minute that passed! Within moments, the APC had brought them a few hundred meters away from the infiltrated facility.<br><br>He leaped out of the APC, studying the environment about him. Behind him was a tower. A very good place for sniping, he thought to himself. He enjoyed sniping, but this was not the time and place to snipe. For one thing, it would have been a waste of time. The terrorists were defending the stronghold and it was highly unlikely that they would leave their stronghold in search of enemies until they were sure there were very few counter-terrorists alive. His team members would disapprove of him sniping at the spot anyway. Secondly, he only had $2,600 with him, and could not even afford the cheap Steyr Scout rifle.<br><br>With the money he had, he bought an MP5/N (with a few extra clips), a Kevlar vest and a helmet. Fully equipped, he rushed towards the stronghold, hoping to catch the terrorists by surprise. He was fortunate. Even as he approached the entrance to the carpark, no terrorists had arrived yet. He found a nice hiding place in a shed nearby and waited for a brave terrorist to appear.<br><br>He did not have to wait for long. Sure enough, a member of the Phoenix Connection appeared. Training his MP5/N at the terrorist's head, he fired several bursts. The startled terrorist turned around to face him and fired two shots at him with his AW/M! Unfortunately for the poor terrorist, the AW/M was no match for the power of the MP5/N at close proximity. Within moments, the terrorist slumped to the ground.<br><br>He liked sniping. The AW/M was like a godsend to him and he rushed forward to pick it up. As he was about to reach the weapon, he heard the tell-tale clinking sound of a grenade tossed around the corner. He retreated hastily to safer ground, but it was too late. The fragments of the grenade ripped through him as he retreated, and if he had not worn a Kevlar vest, he would have been dead by now. He was grateful that he had thought to buy the vest instead of saving the money.<br><br>Anger filled his heart, as he rushed around the corner to seek his would-be murderer. An L337 member was waiting right there, and was firing his Glock at him. He fired his MP5/N using automatic mode at the terrorist, and within moments, the man in front of him became a corpse. He went forward to rummage the belongings of the terrorist. All he could find was the Glock, and nothing but the Glock.<br><br>Stingy bugger, he thought to himself. He could have been the one lying on the ground if the terrorist had even purchased a measly MP5/N.<br><br>Discarding his MP5/N, he returned to the corpse of the earlier terrorist and picked up his AW/M.<br><br>He crept silently towards the car park. As he expected, three terrorists were skulking behind the cars and the pillars. One of them sported an AK-47, another carried an SIG 552, and the last one sent a shiver through his spine - the man carried an AW/M!<br><br>Like all normal snipers, he began running and jumping around, all the while firing at the terrorists using the scope on his AW/M. There were several close moments when the man holding the AW/M almost got him - he could feel the bullet brushing past his face - just almost. Blood flowed freely from the gaping holes on his body, but he was able to kill the terrorist who held the AK-47 with one shot. The Arctic Avenger who carried the SIG 552 was still firing at him relentlessly and he took cover behind several crates.<br><br>For a moment, everything was silent. While scoped with his sniper rifle, he strafed out from cover and fired at the man holding the AW/M. The terrorist fell backwards in a most satisfying manner. He felt the exhilaration that all snipers feel when they have successfully sniped a victim. He had however forgotten about the terrorist holding the SIG 552. Several shots hit him in his chest and his neck, and once again he rushed into cover. The meter that indicated his health was at 1 point! He had bullets lodged in various parts of his body, his lungs, his thighs, his arms and his legs! He suffered fractures in his arms and legs. Even his Kevlar vest would not help him now. Even one shot from the Glock could kill him.<br><br>Damn! He cursed beneath his breath and contemplated the possiblity of escaping. Despite the fractures in his knees and ankles, he could surprisingly, still run and jump about. He was not at all concerned that fractured bones would hamper his speed and agility. The only problem was the escape route. There was only one way, and that was where he came from. The only problem - there was no cover. He was pretty sure a hail of bullets would greet him if he were to make even the tiniest move. His heart began beating faster as he heard footsteps running towards his direction, no doubt belonging to the terrorist. He had his favorite weapon now, the AW/M and he did not want to lose it! There was no guarantee that the counter-terrorists would be able to rescue the hostages and that he would be able to afford the AW/M again!<br><br>Hope arose within his heart when he heard the familiar sound of the APCÂ¡Â¯s engine. His buddies were coming to his aid! A sudden rush of joy filled him as the APC approached. He would live after all!<br><br>The APC moved in, closer, and closer, and closer. "Turn the APC into the carpark!" He yelled. The driver of the APC, unfortunately was probably inexperienced and had difficulty navigating the APC. The APC was moving in every possible direction, except towards the carpark.<br><br>Shit!! He cursed to himself as he foresaw his impending doom. The APC was closing in on him! Within moments, all that was left of him was his broken body that formed an imprint on the wheels of the APC. The last words he heard, before he drew his last breathe was, "Oops ... sorry."<br></div>
