            <div class='col-md body'>source : <a href="http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/hey/story/0,4136,74736,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/hey/story/0,4136,74736,00.html?</a><br><br>Lewd? Crude? But we all respond differently, what<br>BY now, you'll have read about Taiwanese foreign minister Mark Chen's comparison of Singapore to pi sai (Hokkien for snot, or dried nasal mucus, if you're The Straits Times, or booger, if you're my 4-year-old).<br><br>This is not necessarily a bad thing.<br><br>As you know, our elders in Singapore have often equated pi sai to gold ('Why you keep digging your nose? Looking for gold ah?'), so perhaps Mr Chen was actually saying that Singapore was a gold nugget.<br><br>In addition to that, he also said that Singapore was trying to 'por tiong kok eh l** p**', which literally means 'carry China's testicles'.<br><br>Which, if I may correct my colleagues in The Straits Times, is not quite the same as 'sucking up'.<br><br>Any linguist will tell you that is a different sort of vulgarity.<br><br>What Mr Chen suggested, of course, is not possible. I took A-level biology and I can tell you that a booger cannot possibly take the weight of testicles, especially if they are as big as China's.<br><br>Our Foreign Affairs Ministry's very measured response was: 'This is not the first time Singapore has stated our concerns about Taiwan. Many other countries also believe that Taiwan is pursuing a dangerous course towards independence. Resorting to intemperate language cannot assuage these concerns.'<br><br>Assistants to Mr Chen were last seen trying to find out what 'intemperate' and 'assuage' are in Hokkien.<br><br>Now, if I were the foreign minister, my response would have been as follows:<br><br>Lu kong si mi? Buay song, si boh? Mai kong an ne chuay. Lim bei kar lee kee war kow kong.<br><br>For those of you who didn't watch Royston Tan's 15, allow me to translate.<br><br>It means: 'You say what? Not happy, is it? Don't talk so much. Your father and you go outside and talk'.<br><br>Our Foreign Affairs Ministry believes in showing our graceful Singaporean nature, but I'm the kind of guy who believes that when in Rome, talk like the Mafia.<br><br>I think we let him off easy. Other people might not have been so kind.<br><br>Below are the types of response Mr Chen might have received had the following parties been working in our foreign ministry.<br><br>The US: 'Our intelligence tells us that Taiwan has weapons of mass destruction. Oh, what the heck, does it really matter anyway?'<br><br>China: 'We have 610 missiles pointing at you. Say that again.'<br><br>Al-Qaeda: 'Boom.'<br><br>Donald Trump: 'You're fired.'<br><br>Member at Singapore Island Country Club: No action taken.<br><br>PAP member: 'Don't so angry lah. I invite you to our party at Zouk next year.'<br><br>Sheikh Haikel: 'You go wear white panties lah.'<br><br>Bank spokesman: 'Were the testicles in a safe deposit box? Uh-oh.'<br><br>Ken Lim: 'It's obvious you can speak Hokkien well, but you need to work on being a star, all right?'<br><br>Me? I'm just happy that I finally have a reason to use Hokkien vulgarities in a newspaper.</div>
