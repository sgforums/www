            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Riff,<br>The most important thing to note is that it's almost impossible for you to try to change someone. Even though you think and you know that it's for his/her own good. There are a few things you can do:<br><br>1. Compromise: Strike up a deal with her. Let her know how you feel and meet somewhere in the middle. Meaning, you change a little... she changes a little.<br><br>2. You make all the adjustments yourself. This requires the biggest sacrifice. For this, you have to try and see if you can accept this particular character trait you're having a problem with. Give it some time.<br><br>If none of the above works, I'd suggest that you break it up. Harsh as it may sound, but seems like this issue is the kind that will stay on for a long time.<br><br>Hope that helps.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.<br>8Love never fails.<br><br>if u can substitute the word love with your name.. i wonder how many ppl can even score 40%<br><br>then tink whether u can really so easily say the word "I Love"</div>

Ok I should say the person is too simple, therefore not levelheaded. The person wanted to be like this. She said she wanted things to be simple. But it has gone too far, until she can just don't think about(just a nod or 'ok' when she dun really understand) what I say when I am telling her stuff good for her. This is very frustrating.</div></blockquote>Haha.I too have a friend who's like what you described. Yeah, sometimes its really frustrating to know that she don't really care about what you're trying to do to help her. Well...for me,i just suggest ways and methods to help her and if she's interested to let me help, she'll just agree to it. If not, i just bochup. It's actually her decision whether or not to accept your help and i guess it's quite futile to force it upon her. So try not to force it into her mouth and try not to think too much about it,</div>
