But like suggested, sometimes it's just their characters... Many character flaws are not easy to change... How old are the both of you now? I bet she could be rather young? Or at most in her early 20s or so? Try to take things more easily... Though I'm not directly in the position to judge, I don't really see what you've mentioned as a serious problem? It could be a pity if you just condemn her straight now or do things which are gonna make the situation worse... And if the relationship just ends without even seeing the flower bloom? (as in seeing her open up to you...) From what I personally know... There're mainly 3 types of people... 1. Very open ones who like to talk and share things with others... 2. Very shy or reserved type who only confine in the appropriate people or person... 3. Those who had undergone great disturbances in life and has refused to open themselves up to anybody....<br><br>Now... Your gf certainly don't sound like the 3rd type... Neither is she the 1st type... And my point is? Quiet or noisy people, they usually would need to confine in another... Rather than seeing this fault in her,  why don't you try to make yourself more approachable for her to open up to you? Or maybe the time is just not ripe yet?<br><br>And a FINAL point for you.... If you're prepare to go on a long term relationship with this girl... What you've posted certainly don't sound enough a 'challenge' to me? Do be PREPARED for MORE and WORSE to come.... If you can't even take this one... GOOD LUCK to you... You'll need PLENTY of that....</div>

Its something abt the person's charactor/mindset. How will you feel, and what will you do?</div></blockquote>Think this is a GOOD question for me?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Though as much as I don't like them (the flaws), I have to understand that nothing comes perfect in this world... I would usually try to tolerate things and would even constantly bring up the issues to discuss with her... I would even request for her to 'do something about them' if she can... But when she can't? I simply tries to ignore them or tolerate... Only when  things are PUSHED towards me.... Like 'die die' want you to or have to face it that kinda sitaution... If 'ignoring' and 'tolerating' don't work... I'll cut down on our meet ups till either 1. she dies down on her flaws... 2. my condition is not so taxing and I'm all refreshed to face whatever flaws I have to....</div>
