            <div class='col-md body'>Book or no book smart is one thing....<br><br>The thing is they behave as though the employers owe them living.  Picture this... an employee joined the company as a newbie... with less than satisfactory performance asks balantly for confirmation and a pay increment of $500 + transport allowance... I bet he will ask for more in another 6 months...<br><br>I just feel that if you want a pay raise, you have to justify with your performance....<br><br>Most of the managers here cover various portfolios, and this newboe hopped on the bandwagon and complains incessantly about the loust renumerations, the heavy work load...

            <div class='col-md body'>yup i think this is quite true.... i would think that the problem may be more obvious especially to those who grad with good degrees thinking that it's easy to find a job anywhere<br><br>when i was on internship my boss used to tell me that a good honours degree only opens the first door and the rest depends on performance... learn as much as u can while u are new because as u become more and more senior within the company u can no longer say u don't know this don't know that already<br><br>in fact from the 2nd or 3rd job onwards employers look at past work performance and job scope rather than the degree.... hence the degree really becomes useless once u find the first job<br></div>

Hard work no longer guarantees job security. While the younger generation of grads may consider themselves more 'mobile' compared to middle-aged and earlier forties staff, there is still a need to continuously 'prove' yourself.<br><br>This is especially so in the private sector, in industries such as aerospace, manufacturing waffer fabs and pharmaceutical. It's not enough to deliver on your product, one has to deliver faster, better and cheaper products annually to demanding customers who expect price cuts and discounts.<br><br>Graduate positions in such industries have a high attrition rate because the pressure-cooking environment is simply not worth the pay companies are offering. Managers can make or break their future. Knowing exactly what your boss needs can play a key role in career advancement. A wrong second-guess can snuff out your future plans. Boot-licking is discouraged and only value-added services are demanded.<br><br>Yes, a degree opens many more doors than others, but ultimately, it is simply a passport to your new career, just like a diploma and an NITEC cert. The pendulum can easily swing the other way and those that underperform will surely face the axe.<br><br>To single out graduates for this kind of behaviour is as naive as the current cold war between polytechnic and JC students over which institution of learning is 'better'.</div>

Heck I have a right to say as I come from both sides of the fence. Problem is these young punks with all the degrees think they are worth a high starting salary. I tell them I have lots of paper qualis too but what when I ask them what do they have to offer that will make a difference to my company, they are stumped.........so much for Sillyporean graduates. I'd rather hire foreign talents now as we business people in the business community see the hunger in their eyes, from China/India etc...and they do not quibble with you over starting salaries. Instead, they tell you only to give them an increment if they do well.

            <div class='col-md body'>I held a degree in nursing along time ago ...working for 1.3k per month and did free OT and got scolding for not managing my time even though I had to nurse 24 patients with only 2 assistant nurses in the PRIVATE CLASS side.<br><br>Then they gave me a roster of 12 days to 1 off day at each ends with very interesting rotations as in I will do one day duty and one afternoon duty alternately. Cannot say anything - just shut up and tahan. I fell sick. I was scolded on not being healthy. Lovely. If that wasn't enough , I actually got a warning from the nursing officer about taking one day sickie off on my third month - I was running a very high fever and came to work . I nearly collapsed but still go scolded for not performing that day and I was denied permission to go home although one of my colleagues took my temperature and said I was 39 deg. It was only after I hit 40 deg - they had to send me to ED.<br><br>So I kept quiet and decided. Nursing in that particular setting was shit . I told them goodbye when another employer decided I was good enough to be employed for 1.75k per month with only office hour duties.<br><br>I collected experience and went overseas ....which got me 3 times the pay for less of the work.<br><br><strong> The moral of the story: Just Shut up , bide your time and have your experience. The more difficult a workplace is  , the more you will become able to handle problems in any workplace anywhere in the world. If your employer does not appreciate you , just run when another door opens. </strong></div>
