            <div class='col-md body'>Before I start this with you. May I know if you REALLY KNOW your STUFF well 1st? Or is this just another NONSENSE UTTERING of yours again? Anyway, just HOPE this is FOR REAL... If not, please tell me so and not waste my time....<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by blurblop:<br><strong><br>Perhaps, I could shed some light.</strong><br>Thanks... Always OPEN and WELCOME so...<br><br><strong><br>In the event of being sued for non payment of debt, unless it is in a small claims tribunal, the plaintiff's solicitor would have sent you a letter of demand to settle the claims.</strong><br>I had refused to settle the claims as I think I do NOT deserve to PAY for the MISTAKE and FAULT made by the COMPANY. The party put me on a LOOSE END 'wild goose chase' while putting LEGAL ACTION against without me in reach for my fair piece of EVIDENCE.... CLAIMING that they have given me SUFFICIENT TIME to do so and I had NOT responded.<br><br><strong><br>At this stage, you may either defend by an affidavit(detailing your defence) or if you did not file one, the plaintiff can take out a summary judgement against you. In Singapore, it is called : Order 14.

On both counts, you are dangerously close to commiting a crime called perjury and contempt of court both of which can be custodial offence.</strong><br>I KNOW of the 'DANGER' I'm bringing myself to by POSTING this up in this forum.... BUT by the GRIEF and the LIFESTYLE that I've been SUBJECTED to.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> LIFE is beginning to hold a DIFFERENT MEANING.....<br><br><strong><br>That being the case, when the judge refuse to listen to your verbal representation, she is probably helping you to escape inconsistencies in your verbal representation and the summitted affidavit.</strong><br>I WASN'T given a FAIR CHANCE of speaking up for myself.... And A STRONG POINT to make... Whatever's the CASE, without listening to what I have to say, she SHOULDN'T have made the REMARK that "It's people like you or REFUSE to PAY UP and WASTE her time, causing her to stay back and work till such late hours...."<br>FIRST of all, it WASN'T me who CAUSED her to work LATE, it's the people in front of me who had been giving UNREASONABLE and STUBBORN points that had WASTED her TIME... NOT me.... SECONDLY, I can UNDERSTAND that she's TIRED and WORN OUT from the previous cases.... But this is a DIFFERENT CASE and DIFFERENT ISSUE from the PREVIOUS cases that she'd handled... Learn to UNDERSTAND that and people WOULD give her that FAIR SENSE of RESPECT... I know... She's the BIG SHOT, she DON'T need that... Perhaps she DON'T even care about it at all..? BUT she's the JUDGE... She THINK she was in a PLAY ROOM? How come you EXPECT such words to come out of a JUDGE's MOUTH in a COURT SESSION?<br><br>Please blurblop... IF you're FOR REAL... Do me a favour? Write to me at Devil1976sg@yahoo.com? I wish to discuss this FURTHER... BUT NOT here... I DON'T want my PERSONAL LIFE EXPOSED...
