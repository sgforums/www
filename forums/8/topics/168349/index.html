            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm. I believe that there will be an indication on your cert that you did it as an external student, I'm not sure. I guess the question you should be asking yourself is that will companies discriminate against external programmes when it comes to employment. I believe that this is very important with the job market being so darn competitive these days, you would want to make the right decision as to your institution or avenue of choice in persuance of your degree. I mean I am in your shoes as well, and everytime I go for one of those education fairs, the same question always hangs at the back of my mind-if I do this programme, at this institution, through this avenue,, will I be employable in the future come graduation.<br><br></div>

But becoz of financial reason, he has to come back to Singapore and work for ard half a yr and then went to Aussie to complete his Degree in the University of southen Australia (Now is dropping but was once a 3-4 star university).
