            <div class='col-md body'>Cos my fren says that his bf does nor allow her to wear it cos he felt it is too revealing. I dun know if she is considered a good figure, I think it is 33c-24-34. and she is about 1.66m and weigh about 48kg..not too sure...anyway, she have not worn one before, only those two piece tank tops.<br><br>I think it is alright though but I dunno what the guys think though.Most guys think she is pretty too if that helps.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>But one thing I realise that guys keep ooking at her boobs when she wear a a spagetti strap top...and I dun think it is advisable to catch too much of unwanted attention...What am I blabbering about??:blush:<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 04 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmmm anyways. It is alright if a gal doesn't wear too revealing though. But hey,<br>a gal choose what to wear right ?

            <div class='col-md body'>Everyone has the right to wear what he/she wants, and as many posts have mentioned before, boyfriends do not OWN girlfriends and vice versa.<br><br>BUT... if the girl is wearing it purposely to seduce guys, then the boyfriend has the right to express his views/get a little sensitive.<br><br>People should just wear whatever they like as long as its comfortable and its not some attempt to pose. Boyfriends should also be more open-minded cause I'm sure they would have lurved to ogle another girl in a 2 piece.<br><br>But ultimately, if the attention is uncomfortable for either party, then forget it.. with a world full of sex perverts, showing a little less flesh won't kill.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Is it cold in here, or is it just me?<br></div>

So my fren dunno what to so since she feels that she is only young once. Anyway, she lives in the western country so it is not that bad. I guess her figure is ok considered that she is an Asian and she really do sports to keep it trim and fit anyway she is quite like me can never out on too much weight no matter how much we eat,<br><br>Her bf is quite traditional kind.So how??<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 04 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Like i said in a relationship, its abt abt mutual trust and tolerance. On one side, the girl has the right to wear what she wants. But if she wears too revealing cloths and attract lots of attentions and ogling from the other guys, her bf( depending on the guy, some guy dun mind, but some do) may feel very uncomfortable. If he does, then i think its advisable for the girl not to wear bikini. If the guy dun feel comfortable, i think its ok.<br><br>Well true, the bf do not own the girl, but the girl, i feel should, should not do things which the bf is uncomfortable. Afterall, being together is abt accomodating each other. Same thing goes for the guy. The guy also should not do things which the gf is unhappy abt eg like ogling at girls when she is ard or something .....<br><br>Mind</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>On wearing bikinis or other revealing clothes, somehow guys will always tell girls who are not related to them to wear those revealing clothes, but when it comes to their gfs, i think they will say," NO! NO!"<br><br>"... and I will be so happy if the other guys who are gawking at her, are so jealous of me that she is my gf... So, why be jealous where you can think of it this way?     Why be a masochist and suffer, be a sadist instead..."<br><br>Hehehe, prodigal, u know, when my frens and i look ( or ogle or whatever u call it), we are not jealous of the guy. We are juz trying to get a feast for our eyes <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">.<br>And i think many guys think in the same way as us, that is why i think guys dun want their gfs to wear revealing clothes.<br><br>Mind<br></div>
