            <div class='col-md body'>To Mind<br>"On wearing bikinis or other revealing clothes, somehow guys will always tell girls who are not related to them to wear those revealing clothes, but when it comes to their gfs, i think they will say," NO! NO!""<br><br>Well, that is not true. I always tell some of my ang moh lady friends not to wear so revealing when I first came go to UK, and it is winter then. These women just simply bochap... After a period of time, I got so used to seeing pretty babes with revealing clothes. It is not like in Singapore, which is exaggerated by wolf calls and cat-whistles. Hence I think if you see it too often, you just can't be bothered.<br><br>Well, I know what you mean... Even though I have some Asian values in me. I am now perfectly okay if my gf wears a bikini. It is her body and she chooses to wear whatever she wants. Of course, I will give my advice first that whether she will look good or not..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I dun reali bother whether my gf wears a bikini or not cos at most times she does not wear bra and she has less than 20 bras in her wardrobe so if she wears a bikini, i wun reali mind cos a pretty figure is for all to see and feel jealous abt and i can tell my gf is 34c but she wears a 34,34a,34b bra cos like me she hates big breast cos it looks like watermelon........ so the purpose of wearing them is make her breasts look smaller<br>which is more beautiful for me at least......<br>whenever she goes out wif me, the chance of she wearing bra is less than 5%</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So sucky for the bf to restrict his gf from wearing what she likes. Its her body and her pride to flaunt it. If she has the confidence (i commend that) to wear a bikini definately she should have a correspondingly equal body. If i were to have a gf like that i would really be happy and it'll probably do my ego(hehe   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">) some good, and I would try to be as close to her as much as possible!<br>Hmmm but i've never had a gf who would dress revealingly, so the first such gf the first few times i go out with her i might feel slightly uncomfortable it doesent really matter.<br><br>Heheheh! On another issue ......<br>Anyway hor, i think wearing the common beige/white bra together with dresses that will show the brastrap is very tacky, obiang and boring. A plea to the girls: please do not feel intimidated to wear black instead leh..... hehehe (cant really go public for red and the likes... hor) Perhaps i dun care about the bra itself, but since the strap is showing change the STRAP color can?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>My wallpaper for which has been there for almost half a year shows Rinoa Heartily (hehe which one?) wearing her usual blue dress but with her 'black' instead of 'common beige/white' really shows some CLASS!<br><br>[This message has been edited by Sartori (edited 11 January 2000).]</div>
