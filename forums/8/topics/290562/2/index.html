            <div class='col-md body'>Their methodology<br><blockquote>The core of our methodology is the belief that expert opinion is a valid way to assess the standing of top universities. Our rankings contain two strands of peer review. The more important is academic opinion, worth 40 per cent of the total score available in the rankings. The opinions are gathered, like the rest of the rankings data, by our partners QS Quacquarelli Symonds (www.topuniversities.com) which has built up a database of e-mail addresses of active academics across the world. They are invited to tell QS what area of academic life they come from, choosing from science, biomedicine, technology, social science or the arts and humanities. They are then asked to list up to 30 universities that they regard as the leaders in the academic field they know about, and in 2007 we have strengthened our measures to prevent anyone voting for his or her own institution.<br><br>This year we have the opinions of 5,101 experts, of whom 41 per cent are in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, 30 per cent in the Americas, and 29 per cent in the Asia-Pacific region. This includes respondents from 2005 and 2006 whose data have been aggregated with new responses from this year. No data more than three years old is used, and only the most recent data is taken from anyone who has responded more than once.<br><br>A further 10 per cent of the possible score in these rankings is derived from active recruiters of graduates. QS asks major global and national employers across the public and private sectors which universities they like to hire from. This yearÂ’s sample includes 1,471 people, with 43 per cent in the Americas, 32 per cent in Europe and 25 per cent in Asia-Pacific. </blockquote></div>

Would you join a university that helps normal students become great, and great students become excellent...or somewhere which spends their resources recruiting great students from the beginning?  I would say that the first one is a good investment, while the second one doesn't really do anything to add value to the students.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

Like you said, NUS strives to be a professional research institute. If your lecturers spend *most* of their time on educating/coaching/teaching students, when will they have time to do research?<br><br>Don't forget, it is "publish or perish" for those lecturers.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>In fact, lecturers are often most happy during semester break.

NUS used to have quite a high entry requirement to get in. Due to government encouraging NUS to open up more spaces for locals and foreigners to study, NUS's entry standard dropped, eg Engineering's entry standard from last time A-level score of A,B,B to B,C,C i think.<br><br>With more students now, it will obviously lead to a bad staff to student ratio. Same for NTU. Imagine if SMU didnt get going, can you guess how horrifying the staff to student ratio in NUS and NTU will be?</div>
