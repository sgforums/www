            <div class='col-md body'>it is like that one lah.... First year's annual leave can only be used the second year. Usually only 6 months then got sick leave.<br><br>You first time work issit?<br><br>It is fair enough that thru labour law that you work a full year before you get the annual leave. And the leaves can max be kept for till the next year. Unless the company has different policy. About the first year no unpaid leave is part of labour law too. Your mum can still take leave.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by kilua:</div><div class="quote_body">http://willythecop.blogspot.com/<br><br>My mom is working at the Tuas South Incineration Plant as a cleaner under the contract of a private cleaning company. The company pays her S$700 a month for a 5-days work week. The pay is not high, but at least reasonable.<br><br>Now, the cleaning contract has ended for this cleaning company and the contract has been given to another new cleaning company. And so my mom's new boss had a meet-the-people session to tell the cleaners his rules:<br><br>1. The pay is reduced to S$500<br>2. Now it has to be a 5.5 days working week<br>3. There will be a cut in manpower as there should not be more than 3 people working at an area, regardless how large the area space<br>4. No annual leave and sick leave for the first year<br><br>And there was where my mom and all other old uncles and aunties got a shock... NO ANNUAL LEAVE AND SICK LEAVE FOR THE FIRST YEAR?!? Hello? These are not hyperactive teenagers we're talking about! This new boss is expecting all his 50-60 years old cleaners not to fall sick for one year? How realistic is this?!? And so what if they DO fall sick? Pay cut! Not a difficult guess right?<br><br>I'm wondering, how did the National Environment Agency (NEA) chooses their cleaning company to contract out to? Why is there such an obvious cost reduction effort from this new cleaning company? Is it because NEA is not paying them enough?<br><br>And is the boss allowed to take away annual and sick leaves for his workers? Is the Ministery of Manpower (MOM) allowing this? If that is true, who is there to protect these old cleaning workers?<br><br>So much for a good retirement in Singapore... WTF</div></blockquote>outscource lor...<br><br>like the construction industry working on HDB projects...everybody try to undercut each other to get the contract....in the end all die.company cannot make money...workers cannot earn money...work eventually cannot get done.</div>
