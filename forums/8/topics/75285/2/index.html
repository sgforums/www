Considering all the different factions in that country now, there will be widespread chaos and fighting in the power vaccum.<br><br>Not to mention all of these local factions are more interested in their own vested interests in seeing the US out of Iraq rather then the Iraqi people themselves, considering how many civillians have killed in their "strikes" supposedly directed at the US troops. Do you think they really have the best interests of the Iraqi people at heart? Not by a long shot.<br><br>At least the world, while not exactly going in without ulterior motives, has some form of accountability and order in running Iraq as it is. The tragic thing is that the Iraqi's are too blind to see it as it is and those who can see this logic are killed by their own. I wonder what goes on in their minds anyway, if they drive the foreign "invaders" out, what next? They will have to contend with their local enemies trying to grab for power, so much for that secure future for their children...</div></blockquote>The reason the US want a presence in Iraq is bcos of the Black Gold, or oil to u and me. Not only will we one day be the Strongest Nations, but we will also control the worlds economy. Ther is so much oil in Middle East that the US knows whoever controls the Oil controls the world economy.<br><br>Ok theyv got rid of Saddam, we only hav the US's word 4 it that he was a bad man. They control the media, they control wot we see, they ther4 control wot we think, if they control wot we think they control us.<br><br>But kno they shud leave Iraq, and allow Iraqis to rebuild itself and not put in a Puppet government so that they still control Iraq.<br><br>Peace out!!<br></div>
