It would set off a mass spree of hostage taking in Iraq.<br><br>I'm also quite surprised by the lack of knowledge in this discussion.<br><br>We all know that Sth Korean  have nuclear weapons. They have had it for quite sometime now and the reason the US dont attack korean is because korea do not posse a threat to world security. Yes they have nuclear weapons, and are developing more but Iraq were a greater threat because there was a high probability of them actually using these weapons to attack the west (if they could actually get hold of any). Korea dont want war, they have enough problems trying to feed their people.<br><br>Yes, at the end of the day its all about oil. He who rules the oil, rules the world.... its lucky that Iraq "had" nuclear weapons otherwise bush wouldnt have been able to find an excuse to attack them...<br><br>As for Japan, I feel sorry for the 3 captured cilivians.
