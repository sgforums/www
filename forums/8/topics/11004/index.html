            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes, you can't have everything, you will be contented that you still have memories, no matter sweet or sour. In my example, there were relationships which I did not treasure until it was too late. There's nothing much I can do and I will always feel regrets. No matter how bad the relationship ended up, I still have pleasant memories of each person I once loved. Well, I practise selective memories, so usually they are sweet and romantic ones.<br><br>I dun dwell in my memories, 'cos there's simply too many things happening in my life for me to keep revising them. However, from time to time, certain places, things, smells or actions will trigger off my memory box and remembering these memories that were once treasures to me simply makes me smile, and make my day more delightful.<br><br>Living in memories can be bad. I know the consequences... dun spend too much time on them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Hymen:</div><div class="quote_body">Shervon99, serious ah???

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, i'm a person who knoe tht things wont turn up rite in the end and i will still try it...<br><br>Memories to me is very important too. My GF for 6 years plus sure knoe this very well... I nearly live my whole life in memories and tht's make me very sad at time when i think abt it..And tht's why how far i go, i will still come back to her.  I'm born such a person and nothing to change abt it..<br><br>I personally have many experiences with things tht i knoe wont turn up rite in the end and still try..but i never live in regrets ... I fall for many persons in my life when i knoe we can;t be together... I'm a person who don hide feeling from anyone...my gf likes to say tht i'm an Expressive person. But since u can't control ur heart and if things are there to happen..i will follow suit... One gal once told me , the world is so big...but we are still able to meet in the internet and that must be fate ,not to mention we managed to meet in HK...Well, i got to admit this must be fate...<br><br>So why don we let it be and don run awys from it.. There are many times when we fall in love without knowing wht will happen.

            <div class='col-md body'>i guess that something like this is not just sad .. its anger, frustration, sadness, its a whole lot of very strong emotions. But even then, I still believe<br>better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.<br><br>i guess i`ve never regretted getting into any of my relationships, but i guess this is also part of the unpredictability of life. There are very often so many factors beyond  your control.<br><br>Still, at the end of the day, I guess this is one thing that makes you feel alive.</div>
