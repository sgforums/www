            <div class='col-md body'>This time old debate has been around since LKY first opened NJC in 1969.<br><br>JC became THE place to go after LHL and LHY both schooled there together with LWL.<br><br>Just as LHL and LHY went to chinese schools instead of RI (and since then, many still believe in the SAP concept) , LKY hoped to set the trend of younger generations being seeded towards the JC-university route so that he could develop a pool of 'graduates' to replace his aging old guard.<br><br>As a result, many among us bear the misconception that polys are for "losers' while JC are where the brightest go.<br><br>Imagine where parents would 'nudge' their children to....<br><br>This bias view, however misguided, was intrinsically nailed down on our generations; as a result, the poly intakes were simply 'second-best' and we continued to believe (naviety) that only the best went to JCs with the 2nd-rate students heading for diplomas.<br><br>Hopefully, the mindset of our next generations will adjust to a more open view towards polys. Such broad-based understanding is needed to allow our youngsters the right frame of mind to determine just which path is best for their own educational needs.<br><br></div>
