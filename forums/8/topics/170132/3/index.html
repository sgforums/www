This is a soft sell strategy and deemed more acceptable to those subjected to it.<br><br>Mother Teresa didn't go to India to convert Hindus to Catholics. She went to care for the "poorest of the poor". To use the influence, connections and money of the Catholic church to provide soft beds, clean sheets and medical care to those too poor to afford. If a hindu patient dies in her "hospital", she would get her staff to bring the body to a Hindu temple for their religious authority to perform the final rites for the deceased.<br><br>Mother Teresa inspired many Catholics and non-christians around the world with her respect for other religions (namely Hinduism) and her willingness to help non Catholics with no ulterior motive of converting them.<br><br>There are more examples of religious people who believe in Buddism, Taoism and Islam who also show such love and selflessness too.<br><br>Why is it necessary for Christians from certain denomination to hang out at bus stops and MRT station and harass passer-bys with their hard sell tactics?

I prefer her brand of faith and works, than self righteous evangelising fundamentalists who demonstrates more bull talk than actions or sincerity. On top of that, they dont think they are wrong at all. How pretentious or foolish they have become.<br><br></div>
