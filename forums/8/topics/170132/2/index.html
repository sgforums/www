WHether u wanna go hell or not it is ur choice.<br><br>THe reason why we want to "sell" Jesus to u is because God's love is meant to be spread around, and if we keep it to ourselves, that will be too selfish, because what we keep is eternal life for everyone.<br><br>If u are unable to understand How great God's love is, then dun anyhow say people here.</div>
