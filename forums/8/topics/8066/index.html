            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Wanderer, I understand how u feel, initially when I come here, I felt quite isolated &amp; lonely, there r not too much topics u can post to, thus I left the forum for a while, but why takes things so hard, sometimes it's fun to let yr hair down, be relaxed &amp; join in the fun. Maybe when U stay here for a while, U will begin to enjoy this forum too....... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess this question is directed to me, since I am the one making all the fuss about it.<br>Well, this is a free forum, so theoretically, one can post anything he wants, no questions asked.<br>However, in principle, there are lots of other considerations. I think I'm beginning to sound old and naggy here, but I assure you, I am not old (but I might be naggy  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">). There is this thing about consequence. Although this is cyberworld, don't all of you agree that the "object" behind the computer typing away is a true-blue human being??? And being a human being in cyberworld, does that mean that each individual is devoid of feelings???<br>I believe in letting my hair down once in a while, for people who know me, they will know that I am definitely not some old fashioned guy who whiles his time away in some coffee shop. (don't know if i am using the correct stereotype). I just feel that within each of us, there should be a sense of responsibility, and we should care about other people's feelings. For the case concerned, I think that the appropriate thing to do is at least ask for permission right??? How will you feel when a friend comes to your house and grabs some valuable without permission?? How will you feel??? I might be a little oversensitive, but remember, even if you don't mind, some other people might. I rest my case.<br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>
