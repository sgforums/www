            <div class='col-md body'>The way people talk about online retailing being a cheap way to reach a bigger crowd. No doubt no doubt, but people are not used to this method. And they do not ask, why are all the ecommerce companies not earning money?<br><br>And I wonder why, these people are not even cognizant of the improvement on the methods of online retailing. Virtual reality technology that is being developed, why are there no mentions on that? EON Reality, VRML, stuff like that, why no mention on those things? Intel is working with EON to produce a next generation chip for effective 3d rendering, do you people even know what is going on?.<br><br>Do you people even know the industry? What are the advancements made in that area? Do you know the HARD facts? All that is being presented here is nothing but hot air, about theoretical concerns that have little relevance to real life.<br><br>Ill informed, my dear friends, how ill informed are soylent and littleman.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>IO,<br>I agree with you that the valuation of most tech stocks are way too high and that it'll eventually come down substantially. I don't think saying that the whole b2c sector is going to collapse is a little premature and unsubstantiated. I think that there are way too many people jumping into the e-hype right now. But in the years to come its going to play a big part in our business society  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Thanks for your input</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Raymond,<br><br>i have not sat down to analyse whether B2C ecommerce will stand out or not, but there are just too many unknown factors for us to make an analysis: IT is moving too fast with leaps and bounds.<br><br>i think whether it would take off in, lets say, the local context, would largely be dependant on what the authorities (e.g. government) do to foster it.<br><br>Remember the phonecards?? years ago, when it first came out, no one used it. today, you may have a heck of time trying to find a coin phone. (okay.. maybe foster is the wrong word to use)<br><br>(another example is the cash card - pre-erp vs post erp.)<br><br>well, with the RnD in electonic commerce/ monetary affairs going at its current rate, i would say that sooner or later, we are going to have a secure method of managing our finances which catches the sight of our leaders and when that occurs, online retailing may be the way to go.<br><br>let me raise an example of how this may happen: (for you guys out there) ever notice that our $$$ for IPPT is credited into our 11B? this utilises the cashcard/smart technology. It may take a while, but it may happen that our finances might be credited into something like that, and with that, you will definitely have a host of applications that interacts with a card reader and a smart catd.. since payments are going to be easy to process, online retailing may take off.<br><br>i'm not saying that it will happen, but looking at the processes and the way the IT industry is heading, i'd say its a matter of time.<br><br>just my 2 cts.<br><br>archer<br>(in memory of the late Dr Goh Cheng Hian who taught me to look beyond natural influences)<br><br></div>
