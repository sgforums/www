All that 'modern independent woman' crap goes out of the window the moment they start licking the boots of the ang moh..<br><br>But one thing I can do, is say that the phenomenon doesnÂ’t last forever.. As more local guys are marrying overseas, its only time before those feminists, intellectual wh0res finally woke up to find themselves in a 'solace' situation and realise they should remain less vocal and in less unassuming position.. Until then, I propose a toast to all the guys.. You know who you are, and I know you are sick of the double standards thats been practising by the local ladies..
