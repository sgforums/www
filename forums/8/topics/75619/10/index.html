            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmmm...... I'm just thinking.. Why is Ogbunwezeh dissing Singaporeans?? Does he has sth to gain from this? Look, Ogbunwezeh, you can voice your opinion, no problem, but don't you dare say that in the larger extend, Singaporeans are wrong, yea?<br><br>The Cheena ppleZ insult us and not only do you not take the side of SG, you turn ard and bite ur own ppleZ, saying they're childish?! Shame on you!!<br><br>And baby, we're not narrow-minded and we don't look down on the rest of the world. We're just sure of wat we're saying and doing. Get that clear. It's obvious that SgChinese started this shit. The only way for this topic to be cleared fast is prolly to get the whole of them to apologise.<br><br>And to say the truth, we're so forgiving that all these will prolly be forgiven in mayhaps a few years? Nevertheless, i doubt it'll be forgotten. SgChinese, repent!!</div>
