If negative, pls, pls just keep your mouth closed.<br>I have to say most of my Singapore friends are quite friendly, and nobody is talking about all Singapore student, just take care to make sure that fortunately yourself is not the bad guy~<br>And for the Scholarship provided by the government, i think i need to give some explanation. Most of the ppl getting money from the government will have to serve in Singapore for 3~6 years as return, and more than 50% of the Chinese student in Singapore now actually pay all the fees by themselves, i do appreciate the support from the Singapore government, but pls do not say we are just getting everything without giving any return~</div></blockquote>Rabis i agree with you... I'm a singaporean but i agree with ya... Regarding some of the ppl using words such as low class society... etc to describe ur country is in deed childish.

Heck, don't you know you can even find porn magazine in 7-11 placed just beside the toy section? It is not strange that people would like to be born there but does that mean people can insult and scold us?<br><br>An eye for an eye and besides comparing the insults over there and here I say there are more insults over there at Sgchinese than in Sgforums.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Singapore belongs to China? What the heck? Please, Singapore never belonged to China not before and not forever. Just because people from China came here in the past means we belong to China? Then perhaps we should belong to Britain, India, Malaysia and many other countries too?<br><br>Rabis, I know you are a nice guy and would like to stop all this flaming but you alone won't be able to suppress the anger of all Singaporeans.</div>
