            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://img365.imageshack.us/img365/6961/kamalnayagantime2tt.jpg"><br><strong>The tagline of Nayagan in TIME- : "A terrific gangster epic in the Godfather style".</strong><br><br>Time Magazine has released its list of 100 all- time favourite films. Besides the widely acclaimed Satyajit Ray's Apu Triology (Pather Panchali, Apur Sansar and Aparajito), Mani Ratnam's Nayagan and Guru Dutt's Pyaasa have found place in this unranked but alphabetical list compiled by the magazine's critics, Richard Schickel and Richard Corliss.<br><br>The two critics separately picked up 100 films, out of which 40-50 titles made both the lists.<br><br>"Ray's filmmaking is direct in manner, simple in its means and profound in its impact" said Schikel.<br><br>On Ratnam, Corliss remarked,"He has no such difficulty blending melodrama and music, violence and comedy, realism and delirium, into a two-and-a-half-hour demonstration"<br><br>For Pyaasa, Corliss said, "The writer-producer-director-star paints a glamorous portrait of an artist's isolation through dappled imagery and the sensitive picturising of S D Burman's famous songs. And Rahman, in her screen debut, is sultry, radiant - a woman to bring out the poet in any man, on screen or in the audience"<br><br>Bollywood is shorthand for Bombay Hollywood, seat of the largest Indian film industry. But it manufactures only about 200 of the thousand or so Indian feature films; a half-dozen regions boast production sites larger than most of the world's national cinemas. Madras, capital of the Tamil state, is one such place, and its leader - arguably India's top pop-film auteur - is Mani Ratnam. His movies, often dramatizing social unrest and political terrorism, churn with narrative tension and camera energy that would be the envy of Hollywood directors, if they were ever to see them. Nayagan, an early, defining work in his career, tells the Godfatherish tale of Velu, a boy who embraces a life of crime after his father is killed by the police. Velu (Kamal Hasan) has trouble juggling his family life with his life-and-death mob "family"; Ratnam has no such difficulty blending melodrama and music, violence and comedy, realism and delirium, into a two-and-a-half-hour demonstration that, when a gangster's miseries are mounting, the most natural solution is to go singing' in the rain. - Excerpt from Time Magazine.<br><br>Again, just like the Oscars for a Tamil movie, I don't think something is achieved when you have a Tamil movie featuring in the list of global all-time favorites. But it's a feel good factor. One reason why I am personally happy is for Mani Ratnam's Nayagan [needs subscription] making it to the Time's Alltime Top 100 movies, is that despite being based on Mario Puzo's God Father script, Nayagan had its own share of Mani Ratnam's brilliance at throughout the movie. If you ask me to stick out a single favorite shot from the film, I may be dazzled.<br><br>Nayagan had a team that was one of the best during that decade. It had geniuses like Illayaraja, PC Sreeram and the Nayagan himself.<br><br>I haven't subscribed to Time and hence couldn't read the entire article. Thanks Vilvanboy and Srivats for passing on the link, It made my day.<br><br>The TIME Magazine in its latest issue has listed the "Best Films of all Times" Its critics, Richard Corliss and Richard Schickel after much study and lot of deliberations have come up with the tour-de-force of the film world. It is indeed a matter of great pride and honor to see Nayagan being named one in the 100 films. There are virtually no words to describe the happiness of the South Indian people, especially the people of Tamil Nadu.<br><br>Mani Ratham, has time and again proved he is a different director from the rest. His film that came in 80's and 90's were all gems in their own way and he was in top form at that time. At present, he may be a bit silent, but he could always bounce back.<br><br>The film, "Nayagan" is one of those films which could be seen any number of times without any jaded feeling. The film had the one and only Kamal Hassan who gave the performance of his life.  It is quite an irony that, both the director and the actor have lost their Midas touch these days. Nayagan deserved the TIME magazine honor.<br><br>The other films from India to receive the great honor include the three films of Satyajit Ray, the Appu Triology and Guru Dutt's masterpiece Pyaasa. Mani Ratnam is proud to be in the select group of the ultimate directors of India.<br><br>The other important films listed are, Steven Spielberg's ET, Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather- Part 1 &amp; 2, George Lucas Star Wars, Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, Sergio Leone's The Good, The Bad and The Ugly and the great masters classics Federico Fellini's 8 1/2, Akira Kurosava's Yojambo.<br><br>Mani Ratnam has made South India proud.<br><br>Two giants of Tamil cinema got together to make a path breaking film Nayagan. That the sentiments it aroused then, still holds good today is testimony to the acting prowess of Kamalahasan and perfection of director Mani Ratnam.<br><br>The film that got Kamalahasan accolades and the National Award, has earned him yet another honor. The American publication Time has recently compiled a list of the top 100 films from 1927 to 2002. The inclusion of 'Nayagan in this prestigious list has brought international fame and glory to Tamil cinema. Other films include Satyajit's Ray's 'Apu trilogy' and Guru Dutt's 'Pyaasa.'<br><br>According to Time, Mani Ratnam's handling of the subject and the brilliant cinematography are believed to have roused the envy of even Hollywood directors!<br><br>While the US generally confines itself to appreciation of American films as in the case of the Oscar awards, it is indeed a rare occurrence that an American publication has thought fit to bring the top 100 of world cinema into focus. The fact that a Tamil film has received this special honor is equal to winning an Oscar itself!<br><br>The 'Nayagan' is indeed an evergreen hero!<br><br>Mani Ratnam has proved beyond doubt that he is the master among Indian film makers. The latest issue of TIME Magazine has an "All time 100 Best Films" and Mani's Nayagan (1987) features in the list.<br><br>The list was made by noted TIME film critics Richard Corliss and Richard Schickel and contains memorable films like Steven Spielberg's ET, Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather- Part 1 &amp; 2, George Lucas Star Wars, Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, Sergio Leone's The Good, The Bad and The Ugly and the great masters classics Federico Fellini's 8 1/2, Akira Kurosava's Yojambo and many others.<br><br>The only other Indian films featured in the list are Satyajit Ray's Appu Triology-Pathar Panchali, Apur Sansar, Aparajito and the great Guru Dutt's Pyaasa. So Mani Ratnam is in the haloed company and is the only living Indian director to be featured in the list.<br><br>Richard Corliss on Mani Ratnam - Madras- capital of Tamil state is one ssuch place and its leader arguably is India's top Pop-film auteur- is Mani Ratnam. His movies, often dramatizing social unrest and political terrorism, churn with narrative tension and camera energy that would be the envy of Hollywood directors, if they were ever to see them''<br></div>
