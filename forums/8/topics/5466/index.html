            <div class='col-md body'>B4 I start on my content proper, I must tell u pple how interesting and refreshing I find these forums. This site really feels like an area of honest exchange of opinions &amp; life experiences. Now, I thought u pple may be able to enlighten me somewhat on a matter thatÂ’s been bugging me for a long time.<br><br>I had this really close guy friend. Our friendship started off fine, on purely platonic terms, though itÂ’s really not up to me to fathom what exactly was on his mind. This great friendship hung in the balance, when he asked me to be his gf late last year. I was shocked by his request &amp; took quite some time to consider. However, in the end, I rejected him on several grounds: -<br>1. We were close, yes, but not close enough for me to accept all his flaws, as I think a gf should. In crude, realistic terms, we would be a major mismatch due to our vastly different education levels (me being several levels above him) &amp; lifestyles. As normal friends, we would survive better without the commitments of a serious relationship. Having an intellectual equal (or better) as my partner is very important to me. IMO, the basis of a successful relationship lies in our ability to communicate well.<br>2. I didnÂ’t have any special feelings for him. I simply treasured him as a great pal &amp; confidante. It is very hard for me to imagine us having intimate physical contact as a couple.<br>3. I liked someone else then &amp; the thing was, my Â‘close guy friendÂ’ (whom IÂ’m talking about here now) knew about it. The 2 guys had never been on cordial terms with one another &amp; I secretly suspected that he was simply trying to win me over, so as to boost his own ego.<br><br>I had a firm word with him regarding the rejection. Though he promised never to force me to accept him, he still hinted me to reconsider several times, over the few months after the rejection. At that time, although I felt quite irritated by his persistence, I told myself that I must hang on to this friendship, so as to be fair to him.<br><br>Then, came this occasion when he told me that we would inevitably lose our friendship when I enter tertiary education next year. He &amp; his inferiority complex! I was raging mad at his apparent lack of faith in our friendship. I couldnÂ’t take any of it anymore. The pressure he placed on me &amp; his half-hearted attitude towards our friendship. It was the last straw for me. So I started avoiding his calls etc. Until now, we havenÂ’t heard from one another for months.<br><br>IÂ’ve been thinking all this while....Was I wrong to have abandoned our friendship like that? Have I been a jerk (female version of one) to cause him all the pain? I feel like such a sinner every time I think about him.<br><br>Hope some of u can give me advice on this. Thanks.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Everyone had their own perception of what they want in a partner. There are also friends who can only be friends and nothing more (learnt this thru the hard way). It is not wrong of you to reject him, at least you let him know, and not let him hanging in there, dunno anything about your stand. If he persist to continue his pursue, it's at his own expenses, he might succeed, he might not, but obviously he hadn't been too successful on this area.<br><br>As for his inferiority, well, there is nothing much you can do about it, unless he start to buck up and strive to be on par with you intellectually. This, he has to build up on his own.<br><br>If he is really using you just to get back at the other guy whom you are keen, then you can forget him as a friend. Not worth it!<br><br>Otherwise, should you really want to preserve this friendship, perhaps you can try to call him and see if he is still the same guy or had he changed. It takes 2 to maintain a relationship.. cheers!!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, honestly, I think you did nothing wrong. When he took the step to further the relationship, I guess he probably was prepared to "have u as his gf" or "lose u as a friend"<br><br>Its nothing wrong to put a firm stop to something that you feel is not right to you. But if this is an issue that you feel you have to clear up, then by all means go. Call him up and talk to him. Clear everything up with him and if by then the both of you are still comfortable to be friends, that'll be great!<br><br>If not, then perhaps you might have to give up on this one friend.<br><br>Just my 1 cents worth.<br><br>------------------<br>Why? Why me?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MySubterfuge,<br>So don't be so afraid to patch things up. You're not a jerk. You're just defending yourself. By not talking to him for 1 month, he should have seriously understood your message.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh manz... a topic I thought nobody would bring out. Maybe I can shed some light on this issue, since I've been in the same situation before... painful experience... but at least it's over and I've got a wonderful girlfriend right now.. so no complains really.<br><br>In case you haven't figured it out yet, I am a guy. So I shall speak on behalf of the guy, just speaking out.. not defending.... ; )<br><br>I had this really terrific friendship with this girl. As mentioned by MySubterfuge, the two of us were great pals, confided in each other, shared our problems, stuck by each other through thick and thin... It all started out purely platonic of course, then something stirred inside me. Emotions started getting the better of me, and I found myself inevitably falling for her. I approached her, popped the question. She didn't reject me outright, saying that she was quite confused too, and needed time to sort out her thoughts. Finally after 2 weeks, she decided it wasn't going to work. Of course, I cried my eyes out... when pubbing.. smoked... basically did everything I shouldn't have done near my exams, and I suffered the consequences of my foolishness. Flunked one subject and scrapped through the others.<br><br>Of course, things got rather awkward, and we would avoid each other. Stop calling each other, it even went so far as to avoid going out together with our other good friends. This lasted for almost a month.<br><br>BUT.. things did not end that way (and no.. she isn't my girlfriend now either)... being matured and sensible people, we decided to end this foolishness, as it was apparent that it's causing our other friends a bit of unease, as well as the fact that THIS IS REALLY A DUMB AND CHILDISH THING TO DO... (not shouting at you MySubterfuge)<br><br>I started calling her again, she didn't ignore me, we would make a few exchanges initially, as I guess the awkwardness was still there.. then things slowly started picking up again. We started yakking and complaining to each other again, and before we knew it, we were, and are good friends again, almost back to what we were before the entire sorry episode. I stress on the word almost, but I have faith that we will once again reach the level of friendship we once had.<br><br>Of course, what happened to me, need not neccessarily happen to you. But it's a sign that it is possible for you to salvage the friendship.<br><br>One other comment. It is very foolish to assume that higher education equates to higher intelligence. Trust me, I've been with some really idiotic people in university. We have the nerds who do nothing but study.. intellectual.. yes.. but probably the most boring people to have a conversation with.. and we have the party animals who do nothing but party.. fun to talk to... quick witted... and of course the in-betweens...<br><br>Of course they are people who are not as intellectually stimulating in the lower echelons of society. Like the bengs and lians (even then.. not all.. some are really quite smart)... I'd agree with your point that you would want an intellectual equal as a partner.. I for one would rather die than spend the rest of my life talking a lian who knows nothing but canto, mumbo, avex trax, and other nonsense...<br><br>I'm not making any sense already.. need sleep.... zzzz...<br><br>BUT before I go, MySubterfuge, please please please try to salvage the friendship.. it is my belief that a great friend is harder to come by than a great partner. I'm glad I salvaged mine, and I hope you will yours too.<br><br>Cheerio!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey thanks Enigma for telling me your personal experience &amp; giving me some mature advice on this. Same goes to everyone else who responded. Thanks a zillion.<br><br>Just one thing I felt like clarifying. That is, I did not imply &amp; do not feel that intelligence levels are equivalent to education levels. It was more of our vastly differing lifestyles &amp; wavelengths, *due* to our different education levels, that gave me pause. In addition, his inferiority complex because of our education disparity, also emerged throughout our friendship. All these, plus what I had mentioned, made it really hard for me to accept him as a bf.<br>So..hope I managed to get my point across.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, I don't see how as Luf suggested, "As for his inferiority, well, there is nothing much you can do about it, unless he start to buck up and strive to be on par with you intellectually. This, he has to build up on his own."<br><br>Don't think he's gonna manage that much...<br><br>Anyway, with different lifestyles, I don't see how its gonna survive...</div>
