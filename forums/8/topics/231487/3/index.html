            <div class='col-md body'>for one, SIA will never abandon the SIA Girl icon, in fact, they won't becos that's what's SIA is, SIA = SIA stewardess.  And the kebaya is an icon &amp; will remain so and the airline's product &amp; services planned around.<br><br>if there's anything that require improvement, it'll probably be the software aspect.  All the hardware efforts are made, from the first airline to fly the A380 to the largest legroom in Economy or the exclusivity in the super first class, so on so forth.  Perhaps, if there's something that require brushing up, it'll be their service.  There have been complains that the service level has dipped &amp; I believe it has something to do with the ppl that were recruited.<br><br>Moons ago, being a stewardess is a glamorous job but not now, partly because there are jobs offering higher pay, chances of travel and also increased number of airlines that's also recruiting from here.  True, SIA still holds an advantage being an internationally reputed airline &amp; there is prestige associated being a SIA employee for that matter.<br><br>I think its timely that SIA relook at their marketing agency for "a breath of fresh air" because I heard that Batey's used to charge them high prices and also the fact that they might be getting too comfortable to propose the same ideas day in day out.<br><br></div>

This translate directly into the service rendered as these are front line staff, their smile, attitude, demure, etc is impacted directly by the passengers - who will then react - either by complaining or choosing other airlines.<br><br>Hence no matter what SIA intends to position herself or change their marketing tag to change with times, it must bear in mind, at the end of the day, its the front line staff - the cabin crew, the ticketing staff, ppl who answer the hotlines, etc makes the direct impact.</div>
