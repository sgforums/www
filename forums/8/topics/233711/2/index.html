If HDB bans cats, they should also ban dogs. Neither animal should be discriminated against, neither should their owners. I have cats and dogs before, they are no different from each other. </div></blockquote>Actually right, I believe HDB has a reason for not allowing cats in high rise flats. I had 2 cats in a house last time and they were always jumping all over the place, on fences, down stairs without using the steps, etc. I don't think they want a scenario where cats fling themselves off their owners' flats (Cats like to jump without making certain a lot of the time, just watch America's funniest Pets).<br><br>I'm fine with cats in the apartments though, I think so long as the pet doesn't pose a physical threat or inconvenience, it's fine. Ultimately it's still the owner's responsibility, just like taking charge of your children. My cocker spaniel has also made friends with one of the neighborhood cats. She allows him to approach and lick her before he runs off to sniff other stuff  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I can't believe they actually published such a letter, if anything it reflects very poorly on the writer who presents himself as a person trying to draw up any kind of point to keep cats out of HDB rather then finding proper and valid arguments... the whole thing about smaller cat feces and getting scratched being a greater danger is laughable.<br><br>But all in all you can tell this guy writes with an obvious anti-pet aim, the cat thing is just the tip of his iceberg.<br><br>In all fairness, the general quality of the Singaporean pet owner sometimes leaves a lot to be desired and is a shameful state of affairs. Some don't socialize their pets properly, some treat them as status symbols, some teach their pets to dump everywhere (except the home) and don't pick up after them... I can see why some people don't like pets thanks to the irresponsible actions of these owners.<br><br>But back to the other side, it is obvious that the typical Singaporean is not raised with a proper appreciation of animals. Some of my friends have never seen a live chicken and are completely afraid to touch a cat... they don't even know what's the right or wrong things to do around a dog or an any other animal. It is highly likely that to some the only animal they know are other homo sapiens and the cockroach or lizard they see in their house from time to time.<br><br>By and by soceity does not need to listen to them, they are a product of ignorance that is hopefully being reversed as time goes by. It is a poorer soceity if Singaporea does not have a pet culture... and maybe when our personal housekeeping habits improve with our pets this would make the situtation better.<br><br>In other countries when a dog is aggressive or poops all over the place, people will question the owner on why he did not teach his pet properly. In Singapore oddly enough... they blame the animal when by all rights it could easily be trained to do the right thing.</div>
