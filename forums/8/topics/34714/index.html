            <div class='col-md body'>The makers of the flim actually put quite a lot of effort into twisting a lot of historical events to come out with gags. Which makes it tons of fun for the history buff, esp. when so many period flims go about with scant research...</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>That's why I believe Knights is so good as a comedy. It has really a lot of old school stuff in there. And the jokes, though simple, are actually quite well crafted and done in the movie, but not overdone till it becomes dully funny like in most western serious comedies. Though most Asians have a more slapstick sense of humour (idiots, explosives and falling anvils) In Knights, they bring the best of the two worlds together, Owen's wise cracking and Chan's physical comedy.<br><br>They did employ a lot of old-school comdey effects, the wipe transitions (have yet to see them in comedies for a long time), the skizo soundtrack that changes mood every second, and even the all appear at the trapdoor in the floor scene that pays homeage to Scooby Doo better then the movie version itself. Did I mention Tom and Jerry homage in that vase juggling scene? Singing in the Rain part, you will be brain dead if you didn't find that well done. And even Indina Jones with the revolving fireplace gag, except they outdone indy at this, thanks to Owen's fooling around. Shanghai Knights will probably be lots more entertaining then half of the multimillion blockbusters we're gonna see this year. Or worse, half-baked comedies that are nothing but badly flimed and storied movies with no chemistry filled with crude and lously jokes.</div>
