The developer will be demolishing the service apartment tower as well as the shopping centre.<br><br>Construction on Scotts Square will begin in the third quarter of next year, and is due to be completed by the end of 2010.<br><br>Wheelock says that the residential component - 338 apartments of one, two and three-bedroom units - will be launched in the second half of next year.

Chihuly. Venet. Moore. Over S$6.3 million worth of artworks by these four artists will be brought into the city, injecting a kaleidoscope of colours along Scotts Road. Skyline etches out the artworks brought in by a developer, the first to receive the incentive package by URA.</strong><br><br><img src="http://www.ura.gov.sg/skyline/skyline06/skyline06-05/images/p5image.jpg"><br><br>SCULPTURES BY FOUR internationally renowned artists, worth over S$6.3 million, will be brought in by Wheelock Properties (Singapore) Limited, and integrated into the overall design of the upcoming Scotts Shopping Centre and The Ascott, soon to undergo redevelopment and completed by 2010.<br><br><strong>Incentivising art in the city</strong><br>Wheelock Properties is the first to take up the incentive package granted by the URA under its Art Incentive Scheme. Launched in September 2005, the scheme enables developers to earn additional Gross Floor Area (GFA) by integrating art works into their projects. Building owners of new developments within key activity and commercial areas in the city centre can earn up to an additional 2 per cent GFA over and above the maximum allowable under the Master Plan 2003, when art works are integrated into the publicly accessible area of the development.<br><br>Through the Art Incentive Scheme, URA hopes to create a more beautiful and lively urban landscape in the city centre, and develop a signature image for the city in the process.<br><br><strong>An Â‘art-liftÂ’ at Scotts</strong><br>Come 2010, you will be able to feast your eyes on these art pieces as you stroll along Scotts Road. The current Scotts Shopping Centre and The Ascott will be converted into a luxury apartment block with a retail podium. Along with the redevelopment, a S$1.8 million sculpture called Â‘V&amp;A Chandelier 1999Â’ by American artist Dale Chihuly will be installed at the podium when the building is completed by 2010.<br><br>The exterior of the building will also feature three other sculptures Â– Â‘Alice in WonderlandÂ’ by Salvador Dali, Â‘Working Model for Sheep PieceÂ’ by Henry Moore and Â‘Three Indeterminate Lines 1994Â’ by Bernar Venet. Among the pieces, MooreÂ’s piece made of cast bronze at S$2.27 million, is valued the highest.<br><br><strong>Eligibility</strong><br>To encourage the publicÂ’s appreciation of public art, the art work has to be a permanent installation within a publicly accessible area of the development or visible from the street level, to be eligible for the scheme. The art works can be free-standing sculptures or art integrated onto the building facade. Other than sculptures, it can also include significant elements such as water features, as long as they are permanent special features of the building design.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Taken from Today article (Friday July 14, 2006)</strong></span><br><br><strong>Scotts to close by year end for 'super luxury' homes</strong><br><br>Christie Loh<br>christie@newstoday.com.sg<br><br>THIS Christmas will be a tad sentimental for some when the iconic Scotts Shopping Centre shuts its doors on Dec 31 after 22 years in the Orchard district.<br><br>By that day, the 70-odd tenants will have moved out of the mall, according to a letter sent out earlier this week to shopowners from landlord Wheelock Properties.<br><br>Also ceasing operations will be The Ascott Singapore serviced apartments, which were the country's first when the Jumabhoy family opened them in 1984.<br><br>The existing building will be torn down by mid-next year to be replaced by a "super luxury residential and retail development", a Wheelock spokeswoman told Today when contacted, without elaborating.<br><br>She added that a name change was likely although "kind of early to say now".<br><br>Already, physical changes are evident.<br><br>Luxury watch retailer Hour Glass moved out last month, but stayed close by at Tang Plaza about 200m away. Over in the basement of Scotts, music chain Gramophone is trumpeting a "moving out sale".<br><br>"It's a very sad thing," said Mr Anthony Chia, branch manager of Watches of Switzerland, one of the first retailers to set up shop in the mall.<br><br>Even newer tenant Kiehl's, a New York-based cosmetic retailer, is getting a "a little sentimental" about closing its first flagship store, set up in Scotts in Nov 2004, brand manager Lynda Lee told Today.<br><br>For CrÃ¨me, a cosmetics and skincare distributor, finding a replacement to its only retail outlet will be tough.<br><br>"Our customers are so comfortable with the set-up even though it's an old building. When the tai-tais come in, there's not much of a crowd and most of the stores here give personalised service, unlike at big department stores," said Ms Nisha Kader, retail operations director of CrÃ¨me's parent firm Cosmetique Essential.<br><br>Yet, from the developer's perspective, it is also Scotts' very location that will rake in big money when the overhaul is completed by 2010.<br><br>"Nothing can match it," said Mr Lui Seng Fatt, regional director and head of investments at property research firm Jones Lang LaSalle, citing the proximity of the Orchard MRT station and the shopping belt.<br><br>In place of the existing 23-storey serviced residence, Wheelock is planning to build 300 freehold homes in a 43-storey tower, as well as upmarket retail space spread over two floors and a basement.<br><br>Mr Lui estimates that the residential units will draw as much as $2,500 per square foot, similar to the prices attracted by City Developments' St Regis Residences, a top-end condominium on nearby Cuscaden Road.<br><br>If that materialises, Wheelock would make a handsome profit, having acquired the Scotts Road property from The Ascott Group in June 2004 for $345 million.<br><br>Mr Lui expects half of the buyers of the Scotts redevelopment to be foreign investors, who by 2009 will also get to pick from the upcoming 99-year leasehold Orchard Turn retail-cum-residential project by CapitaLand and Hong Kong's Sun Hung Kai Properties.</div>
