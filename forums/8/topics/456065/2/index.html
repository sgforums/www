              Not only PRC leh. My neighbour who moved to here 3 years ago also got attitude problem. They never smile and close then door on us. They are muslim indians. I think they dont like chinese as they never try to be friendly to any of my other neighbours.
              
              Why are they like that?

              <p>Dear Hdw0619, thank you for your reply. In Singapore not everybody likes dogs too......some might want to feed chocolates to dogs (its toxic and dogs will die if consume too much) many singaporeans are not animal lovers too. I understand.</p>
              <p>I hope you read my thread, my dog did not not disturb them. My point is no matter how well I behave, no matter how well my dog behaves, that is not the issue. The issue being lack of respect. Basic respect, if you dont like certain people, you dont have to say hi, just pretend you never see them, there is no need for this huge showy slamming of door and shouting etc. I dont like some neighbors too and I just pretend I never see them but I dont go into their space and do funny things.</p>
              <p>Some countries do have people eating dog meat, whale, seal what have you. But this is Singapore. My dog is vegetarian and a very sweet well behaved dog. I never hear a bark from him. So sorry if you are not a dog lover, maybe its not a chitchat thread for you. I dont want to have to open a new thread on dog slamming. I pick up dutifully after my dog, he is not allowed to pee at cement area, only on grass patch. I think I have done everything I possibly can.</p>
              <p>"Maybe, you should offer them your DOG, then they will like
                                      you. " meaning I should let them eat my dog? Sorry cannot get your joke.</p>
              <p>Thank you all for your reply, dog lovers or not. Thank you for taking the time to do that.</p>
              <p>Have a nice day you all!!</p>

              <p>so sorry Hdw0619</p>
              <p>some of the above message is not for you</p>
              <p>I hope you read my thread, my dog did not not disturb them. My

              <p>And I also know not all chinese eat dog meat, just that I dont get a chance to meet more chinese people, perhaps like yourself, who is nice and normal. I think you English is ok dont apologize.</p>
              <p>Urban living does not promote animal loving, many people seem to think of dogs and cats as lowlives and underserving. But these are domesticated animals and they are PETS, clean and loved. It is sad to know some of these people even abuse animals to vent out their frustration or for the sake of it. I personally think they are cowards, bullying such a small animal. It is very sad when humanity becomes like that.</p>
              <p>Nice to know you. :  )</p>

              </p><p>Dear chibemaruko</p>
              <p>I know your menas .You must be very upest for this situation. I just want to say no every Chinese would do that you said hate dog or have not basic respect . I think dog is lovely and smart . I  would have a dog someday .</p>
              <p>I carefully read the text in front of you, including your answer.Closed too loud, as well throw something dangerous, these acts, I can only say that perhaps you really do not lucky.I do not know how to deal with, because I have not encountered a similar situation.</p>
              <p>We dont have any ideas for other people how to  think about dog . Perhaps you can change a residence then maybe you will meet a lovely neighbor. I know change a residence is a bad idea because it will very trouble .But this change will make you happy and your dog may have another friend who is your new neighber . I sure about that many people love dog .</p>
              <p>"Maybe, you should offer them your DOG, then they will like you. "   This is not my word and I do not agree with this approach.</p>
              <p>Nice to know you too .</p>

              <p>I stay in an estate full of disgruntled foreign talents, they huddle together and my direct neighbor just two meters away slams the door at me everyday. It is either they don't know the art of closing door or being polite. Singapore is successful due to racial tolerance and mutual respect. Being a dog owner, I meet very nice Malays and Indians. Of course if they are afraid I will respectfully let them use the lift etc. Mostly, I get smiles and greetings and good comments on my pet.</p>
              <p>But I think Chinese PRC has different culture from us and I sincerely do not understand their deep hatred for me and my pet. The first day since they moved here, they have been slamming door at my face, kid bad-mouthing my pet and adults agreeing. To say I have neighbors from hell is an understatement. Of course I dont expect everyone to love my dog but I think basic respect is not even there. One time two times I can accept and ignore, but everyday? So much so I have developed a dislike for their type and it is so very tilted. I long to meet nice normal Chinese PRC. I am sure everyone reading this has perfectly normal Chinese friends or colleagues.Sometimes I go out and buy stuff and meet nice chinese staff and I want to be their friend! so i can have a more balanced attitude and dont feel like I am going crazy at my own estate.</p>
              <p>I will appreciate if anyone can recommend me a chinese forum or such where I can meet nice normal chinese PRC for friends and have a better and more balanced understanding of them.I am trying very hard everyday but it is getting very tough.</p>

              <p>a lot of these talents really are liars and opportunists. so far all those i met in my course of employment non are worth the sg gahmen time to accept them here really. many are liars. when they lie their eyes won;t blink. ask them really did a job - they say yest. but actually never do. while others meet you the first tiome ask you where you stay, see can stay at your place FOC or not. curry flabor apple polish sweet talk but listen carefully all junk and gouing in loops, self contradicting. got one sgrean worse, stay there for a couple of years picked up their flair of lying wihout blinking and art of toking in loop-cock. spit and spit and very noisy - open mouthooonly tou hear sian already. some claim to b very talented - can pick up language very dfast - but why are they doing in sg with all these talent? somethign about their talent is not right <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>They slam the door, or the grille gate, you think they are doing so at you. Maybe you are right maybe wrong. Just let them. How long do you think they can keep doing it. 10 years?</p>
              <p>Everytime they slam the door or gate, how do you think they feel? Happy? Next time they slam the door or gate, you smile or laugh at their stupidity. At least you are happy, and they are not. Keep on laughing audibly, and they will get madder and madder, and more hateful and hateful. But you laugh even more.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear TS, just ignore them. you've done your best to compromise with them. It's their failure for not able to accept you and your pet. It's not possible to have the whole world under your control. Life is short, I'm sure you have better things to do than to think how to let them like you and your pet. And, don't forget that the PRC have different culture from us, they are by nature louder and more unfriendly, which is just fine for them and they see no problem in it. But because we live in a different country with different culture, their behaviour irritate us. We have no right to say that they are wrong because it's perfectly alright to behave so in China.</div>

              <p>so sorry Hdw0619</p>
              <p>some of the above message is not for you</p>
              <p>I hope you read my thread, my dog did not not disturb them. My point is no matter how well I behave, no matter how well my dog behaves, that is not the issue. The issue being lack of respect. Basic respect, if you dont like certain people, you dont have to say hi, just pretend you never see them, there is no need for this huge showy slamming of door and shouting etc. I dont like some neighbors too and I just pretend I never see them but I dont go into their space and do funny things.</p>
              <p>And I also know not all chinese eat dog meat, just that I dont get a chance to meet more chinese people, perhaps like yourself, who is nice and normal. I think you English is ok dont apologize.</p>
              <p>Urban living does not promote animal loving, many people seem to think of dogs and cats as lowlives and underserving. But these are domesticated animals and they are PETS, clean and loved. <strong>It is sad to know some of these people even abuse animals to vent out their frustration or for the sake of it. I personally think they are cowards, bullying such a small animal. It is very sad when humanity becomes like that</strong>.</p>
              <p>Nice to know you. :  )</p>
