You forgot about the new family you gonna start with your hubby?<br><br>I am about to get married and i am starting to feel the pressure.<br><br>Your wedding dinner, where, when, how many tables for each side, you will hear alot of request from both side parents.<br>Your new family, they will bother you about where you live, dont want you to live too far, the girl's parents will want thier daughter to live in a bigger house.<br>If you are the guy, the girl's parents will start to have many expectation on you, they want their daughter to marry a guy who can give her a good life.<br>For those more traditional families, once you get married, your parents will start to hint, or even tell you directly that they want to be grandpa/grandma.<br><br>They will start to tell you things like<br>"It's better to be pregnant young, the baby will be more healthy"<br>"Sonner or later you still need to have kids"<br>"The earlier you have kids, the earlier they can support you in future"<br>They come up with every possible reason to urge you to have kids.<br><br>So, unless one or both of you are from a broken family, or your parents dun care about you two at all, or else, it's there's business too, they will be involved in many ways.<br><br>It can only be about two ppl when parents dun care at all.<br><br>Threadstarter, if you are already married and it's really about you and your partner only, you dont have to care about the things i mentioned, a big Congrats to you, you are very lucky that you start your own family without the hassle of trying to satistfy the parents.<br><br></div></blockquote>I guess you are one of those that suffer from a traditional mindset. Good luck.<br><br>I see many people still cannot see that a wedding is between both people. I see many people trying to satisfy their parents are typically more mercenary. They cannot afford a place of their own, or still need to rely on their parents one way or another.<br><br>All these about wedding dinners and requirements distance yourself from the true bliss that weddings should bring about.</div>

I think children should not just keep quiet and bow down to parental pressure.
