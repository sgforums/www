            <div class='col-md body'>Noah 2005 A.D. -- the new dilemma!!!<br><br>In the year 2005, the Lord came unto Noah, who was now living in the<br>United States, and said, "Once again, the earth has become wicked<br>and overpopulated and I see the end of all flesh before me. Build<br>another Ark and save two of every living thing along with a few good<br>humans."<br><br>He gave Noah the blueprints, saying, "You have six months to build<br>the Ark before I will start the unending rain for 40 days and 40<br>nights".<br><br>Six months later, the Lord looked down and saw Noah weeping in his<br>yard but no ark.<br><br>"Noah"! , He roared, "I'm about to start the rain! Where is the<br>Ark?"<br><br>"Forgive me, Lord," begged<br>Noah. "But things have changed. I needed<br>a building permit. I've been arguing with the inspector about the<br>need for a sprinkler system. My neighbors claim that I've violated<br>the neighborhood zoning laws by building the Ark in my yard and<br>exceeding the height limitations. We had to go to the Development<br>Appeal Board for a decision.<br><br>Â“Then the Department of Transportation demanded a bond be posted for<br>the future costs of moving power lines and other overhead<br>obstructions, to clear the passage for the Ark's move to the sea. I<br>argued that the sea would be coming to us, but they would hear<br>nothing of it.<br><br>Â“Getting the wood was another problem. There's a ban on cutting<br>local trees in order to save the spotted owl. I tried to convince<br>the environmentalists that I needed the wood<br>to save the owls. But<br>no go!<br><br>Â“When I started gathering the animals, I got sued by an animal<br>rights group. They insisted that I was confining wild animals<br>against their will. As well, they argued the accommodation was too<br>restrictive and it was cruel and inhumane to put so many animals in<br>a confined space.<br><br>Â“Then the EPA ruled that I couldn't build the Ark until they'd<br>conducted an environmental impact study on your proposed flood.<br><br>Â“I'm still trying to resolve a complaint with the Human Rights<br>Commission on how many minorities I'm supposed to hire for my<br>building crew.<br><br>Â“Also, the trades unions say I can't use my sons. They insist I have<br>to hire only Union workers with Ark building experience. To make<br>matters worse, the IRS seized all my assets,<br>claiming I'm trying to<br>leave the country illegally with endangered species. So, forgive me,<br>Lord, but it would take at least ten years for me to finish this<br>Ark."<br><br>Suddenly the skies cleared, the sun began to shine, and a rainbow<br>stretched across the sky. Noah looked up in wonder and asked, "You<br>mean, You're not going to destroy the world?".<br><br>"No," said the Lord. "The Government beat me to it!"<br></div>
