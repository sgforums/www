And yes there were lots of sin as usual. God probably gave tons and tons of chances as usual, before finally giving up and deciding to just hit the "restart" button. But there was Noah whom He favoured, and that was how the whole world was saved. Also, God decided never to do the flood thing again (probably kenna HUGE water bill from PUB after that episode) and He indicated rainbows as a reminder of that promise (ie. convenant).<br><br>Lesbians, Homosexuals... It runs against the whole point of creating Males and Females, which makes it wrong. I agree that current trends should not be brought into play. Society has developed tolerance for that, God however... Oh well, no comments...<br><br>Incest... In the beginning there was only Adam and Eve, and then his children. Draw your own conclusions. There are some theories that God also created other people, but OUTSIDE of the garden of Eden. He had wanted to keep Adam and Eve special and stuff.<br><br>Lot is an interesting character. He lived in a city full of lesbians and homosexuals. After he left it his own daughters commited incest with him. All the sins to do with sex... Lol... really aLOT. Anyway this is where its pretty clear God is NoNo when it comes to incest.<br><br>The point to sin in my own humble opinion, is that if you consciously do something that is accepted in general to be BAD or SINFUL, you ARE sinning, whether the Bible says so or not. You can't do something that today's society has condemned and bring the Bible out as your shield and say: But Bible never say cannot what...! We know in our hearts, black as it is, whether what we do is right or wrong. And knowing it, we determine our sin. Its all a choice, somehow humans just LOVE choosing to sin. Myself included... its a hell lot of willpower to say NO, i WON'T DO IT.<br><br>Cheerios~</div>
