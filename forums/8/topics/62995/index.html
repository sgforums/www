            <div class='col-md body'>hmm ok misunderstood. anyway it's here:<br><br><blockquote>LEAP YEARS<br><br>The year is defined as being the interval between two successive passages of the Sun through the vernal equinox. Of course, what is really occurring is that the Earth is going around the Sun but it is easier to understand what is happening by considering the apparent motion of the Sun in the sky.<br><br>The vernal equinox is the instant when the Sun is above the Earth's equator while going from the south to the north. It is the time which astronomers take as the definition of the beginning of Spring.The year as defined above is called the trove is called the tropical year and it is the year length that defines the repetition of the seasons. The length of the tropical year is 365.24219 days.<br><br>In 46 BC Julius Caesar established the Julian calendar which was used in the west until 1582. In the Julian calendar each year contained 12 months and there were an average of 365.25 days in a year. This was achieved by having three years containing 365 days and one year containing 366 days. (In fact the leap years were not correctly inserted until 8 AD).<br><br>The discrepancy between the actual length of the year, 365.24219 days, and the adopted length, 365.25 days, may not seem important but over hundreds of years the difference becomes obvious. The reason for this is that the seasons, which depend on the date in the tropical year, were getting progressively out of kilter with the calendar date. Pope Gregory XIII, in 1582, instituted the Gregorian calendar, which has been used since then.<br><br>The change from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian involved the change of the simple rule for leap-years to the more complex one in which century years should only be leap-years if they were divisible by 400. For example, 1700,1800 and 1900 are not leap-years whereas 2000 will be.<br><br>The net effect is to make the adopted average length of the year 365.2425 days. The dhe year 365.2425 days. The difference between this and the true length will not have a serious effect for many thousands of years. (The error amounts to about 3 days in 10,000 years.)<br><br>The adoption of the Gregorian calendar was made in Catholic countries in 1582 with the elimination of 10 days, October the 4th being followed by October 15th. The Gregorian calendar also stipulated that the year should start on January 1. In non-Catholic countries the change was made later; Britain and her colonies made the change in 1752 when September 2nd was followed by September 14 and New Year's Day was changed from March 25 to January 1. </blockquote>taken from: <a href="http://chemistry.csudh.edu/oliver/smt310-handouts/calendar.htm" rel="nofollow">http://chemistry.csudh.edu/oliver/smt310-handouts/calendar.htm</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>found this off the net. hope its accurate and clear:  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>[/quote]<br>First, the 20th century ends Dec 31, 2000, not Dec 31 1999. This fact is because the first A.D. year was considered year 1. If you do the math you find out that the first century ended in the year 100. Continue with this train of thought, and each subsequent century ends in a year ending with "00." But the second part of the "formula" is even more confusing; that being the calculation of leap years. Since a year is more than 365 days in actuality, time must be periodically added to that timeframe. If a year were precisely 365.25 days then adding exactly one day exactly every four years would suffice. But, a year is slightly less than 365.25. As a result, the day added, resulting in the concept of leap years is as follows: Add one day to each year divisible by 4 EXCEPT the year ending a century EXCEPT when that century-ending year is divisible by 400 (i.e., those years divisible by 400 ARE leap years). Example: 1496 WAS a leap year, 1500 was NOT, 1600 WAS, 1700 was NOT, 1800 was NOT, 1900 was NOT, 1996 WAS, 2000 WILL BE. I hope this clears the matter up.<br>[/quote]<br><br>[/quote]<br>Gregory agreed that 3 leap years in every 400 years would no longer be leap years. That makes the average calendar year 365.2425 days, compared with the correct value 365.2422. The rule chosen was that if the last two digits of the year are both zero (1900, 2000, 2100 ...) then it is only a leap year if the first two digits are divisible by 4. Thus 1600, 2000 are leap years, but 1700, 1800, 1900 and 2100 are not. That is considered good enough, for the time being.<br>[/quote]</div>

The names of the months go from the first to the twelfth, and in the case of a year composed of 13 months, a month is named as an encore (it is so-called Â“intercalary monthÂ”) of a month from the second to the eleventh.
