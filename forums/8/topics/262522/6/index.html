Why dont u return to Malaysia and get raped and why u come to Singapore in the first place if malaysai is so good?<br><br>I was in Johor over the weekend and i must agree that police presence is there but we know that this is just temporary. After a while, they will all disappear. You think with the increased police presence, Johor and malaysia will be a SAFE place?<br><br>There is a reason WHY, when mudland and singapore separate 40 years ago, with the same rate, nothing being equal, Singapore has prospered.<br><br>When I say nothing being equal, i mean Malaysia has everything and all the resources while Singapore has none.<br><br>Johor is a Crime-infested land together with Malaysia. You dare to dispute? This is a place of HOTBEDs for crimes such as CAR-JACKING, RAPING, Robberies etc.<br><br>You dare to disprove?<br><br>I can see that you are pushed to a corner and has no principles or contents in your argument at all when I read thru your threads. Basically, your thread has no content at all but desperately trying to prove that JB is a "Safe" place.<br><br>Human beings know better. Indonesian Chinese was gang-raped at Lido Beach just opposite the Singapore shores in JB at 6am in the morning and this piece of SERIOUS news was not even publisized in the papers until the furore.<br><br>Wake up and accept the pain truth that malaysia and Johor baru is a very crime-infested place that in place of Southern Johor Economic Region, South Johor Raping Region has taken place.<br></div>

Even robberies also target chinese.Don tell mi there r no rich malays in JB?<br><br>If the victims are malay,im sure the police will be more pro-active to solve the case.But the bigger picture is that the govt needs to reduce the discrimination against msian chinese,revamp its police force and clean up its act.But all these is easier said than done and prolly it ends up in a NATO(no action talk only)case.<br><br>so that it can guard you even better.<br><br>I read countless reports of how robbers enter thru the open backdoor of the house and ambush their victims.Y not just lock the door in the first place?Take things for granted?Complacency?<br><br>Juz my 2cents worth.</div></blockquote>I need you need to be enlightened. those robbers enter by either front or back doors. Malaysians are not so dumb as to unlock their doors and sleep. One way or another, the robbers have ways to get into the house.<br><br>2 months ago in johor taman skudai, one 20 year old girl was murdered in her bedroom when a robber(s) climbed in from the rooftop and wanted to rob her but went wrong and she was killed.<br><br>1 month ago at 1am in the morning at tanah sutera, one malaysian ah beng chinese driving a proton wira with techno was intercepted at knife-point and forced to alight from his car by 3 robbers and his car was robbed. he stood there in full public view of at least 10 other patrons of a coffeeshop. Robberies are happening in full view of the public 2 months ago.<br><br>currently, gang-rapes and abductions are happening in full view of the public too. petrol stations pump petrol halfway and u can be robbed, gang-raped and slashed as in the case of the 55 year old malaysian chinese contractor and his 30+ year old chinese companion.<br><br>anyone who says that johor is a "safe" place needs to be whacked big time and sent into IMH.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>*Sign*.... I nvr like Msia, but even i think it's a tragic for all e rob&amp;rape happening... Thats why government that segregates races never work.<br>Thank whoever's responsible for the seperation of Msia &amp; Sg, we are what we are now because we no longer have any hindrance to our advancement.<br>Ya i agree with the increase in cops helps, and that it would most likely go away, but it's not solving the problems huh? It's like transfusing blood into a people with his arteries severed, sure it will help, but he will still die if u dont patch him up...<br><br>As for the "msia boleh"... i agree... Msia Boleh at bochap...<br>JB?= Jin Bochap..<br>"The time(for ur demise)is now...the place msia."<br>Visit Msia!(for ur dose of R&amp;R [Rape&amp;Rob]).<br><br>Ppl there just dont care if it's not happening to them. They dont have a pint of humanities about others. Everyone and anyone who witness but do nothing deserves to suffer alongside e criminals. Also i think it's because of the law to bias 'natives' more adds to this trend.<br><br>Ever watch CSI? Its kinda like the hive mentality. When people groups together, they have the feeling of anonymous(NO PUNS TO MY NAME!!) &amp; invinciblilty, hence they becomes more daring. Thats y 10 men dares to stop the BF/GF on bike and nabbed the girl for rape at the abandoned house again &amp; again. Then got government Bias some more!!! Adds to the invincibility factor!!<br><br>When Msia refuse to listen to the advice of Sg back then, they already have sown the seeds of their own failure. I give compliments for delaying the seeds growth, but if they decide to go headstrong with this ideology some more, then they deserved to die in screaming brutal agony!!!<br><br>As to whether to help them or not, i vote not. I'm like "Screw you dude, i'll bet if we had this problem they wouldn't have help us also!" Let the cycle of evil reciprocate!!!

            <div class='col-md body'><br>I would think that having more police is not a good solution at all. Considering the competency and attitudes of the police force, it is but a feeble attempt to calm the situation. It is a poor quick fix to perhaps calm things down but is hardly going to a workable solution.<br><br>Given a choice, ppl don't want to do crimes. Unless u are telling me that Malaysia is a country that cultivates and promotes crime, most of those criminals are actually driven to do such things out of desperation or disillusion of their lives.<br><br>Malaysia is clearly suffering from global competition esp from those coming from China and Thailand.

Even some other country, I think u can see there are several post mentioned here some police are even speeding, driving recklessly.<br><br>I'm not blindly defensive, i stating with fact. I think your view is too biased when u make the comment of malaysia police. I agree to some extent if you are pointing on a few of the bad apples but not the whole basket.<br><br>Bribe? If you don't bribe, will the police can take his gun and demand for money? Is a person own character bribing the police and at the end saying this or that the police is corrupted?<br><br>You think police can simply stop you and ask u pay him coffee money? If you don't hit the law, and you don't evade the responsible to pay the fine, you think the police can ask for bribe?<br><br>I myself, had encounter good police, selfless police. So i'm a walking statement. Do you ever go catch some criminal with a groups of police following you in the middle of night? This happen long time ago but I can tell you, in time of life and death, the police are selfless. Definitely there are bad apples.<br><br>I'm not sure how old are you, but please be more mature when stating things here.<br><br>Apples,<br><br>Ya I quite agree with what you say, but an interim solution is better than none, at least there are starting of some action to curb the crime. I think everyone play a role.<br><br>Proper upbringing is also very important. I think parents play a role to educate their children. And the malaysia education system should be improved to more emphasis on the students morality and understand of good and bad.<br><br>Personally i really hate those robbers and rapists, I would have personally bashed them up but this does not mean we have to make so bad remarks on every forces.</div>

Since many years ago, the police are already collecting lots of bribe and with the increase in police you may well be right in guessing that the bribery is only going to increase. But that points to other deeper root reasons as to why the crime rate has increased significantly in Malaysia.<br><br>Johor Bahru used to enjoy the boom coming from Singapore but not in the recent years. The chinese are blamed for their losses and that is actually a fact  since the malay Malaysians clearly cannot compete in many ways with the chinese in the economic market. It is thus quite obvious as to why the crimes are mostly targeted at the Chinese ethnic groups.<br><br>It doesn't bode well that Singapore does not have close industrial neighbours (Malaysia or Indonesia) to work with. We must not forget that a lot of our basic necessities (water, food, sand, oil, etc.) comes from them and it is thus in  Singapore's very interest to help them and work out on better relationships with each other.<br><br>In this intertwined world, let's also be more open minded and be more constructive in helping each other. There are better ways to handle our neighbour and adding salt to their wounds is not a nice way at all.<br><br></div>
