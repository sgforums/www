            <div class='col-md body'>what i feel is happening here right now is a display of the criminological "broken window" theory.<br><br>basically, the theory is that in a neighbourhood, if one window is broken and left unfixed, it leaves the message that no-one cares and soon, more windows will be broken and crime will spread like an epidemic.<br><br>however, if you fix any window that is broken within a short amount of time, it gives the impression that ppl care and you can't try to mess around in the neighbourhood because someone will come and get you.<br><br>basically, it's just the old idiom, a stich in time saves nine.<br><br>now, it's really up to the JB police to see what they can do.<br><br>they will have do take drastic measures to eradicate crime and keep at it until there is a sudden significant drop in crime. the question is whether they have the determination and intelligence to see this through.<br><br>unfortunately, history is not on the side of the police</div>

Man she could have paid double to do that in singapore!!! </div></blockquote>The ROOT of the problem is still racism.unfair treatment towards the chinese.Y don the malay rapists rape their own race?(i don mean to be racist but they started it first).i tink these bloody scum-of-the-earth are using rapes to show their discrimination against m'sian chinese. Even robberies also target chinese.Don tell mi there r no rich malays in JB?<br><br>If the victims are malay,im sure the police will be more pro-active to solve the case.But the bigger picture is that the govt needs to reduce the discrimination against msian chinese,revamp its police force and clean up its act.But all these is easier said than done and prolly it ends up in a NATO(no action talk only)case.<br><br>Thus the best option is for the pple themselves to exercise extra vigilance.Don't even give the fcukers a chance to pounce on you.Everytime ur out on the streets,be it broad daylight or at night,just outside your house or at the shopping centre,treat it as a battlefield.This may sound funny and far-fetched but its the only way to remind yourself of how vulnerable you are to crime.Remember,the safest place is your home but it may not be 100% foolproof.U need to ensure that u GUARD ur home well FIRST so that it can guard you even better.<br><br>I read countless reports of how robbers enter thru the open backdoor of the house and ambush their victims.Y not just lock the door in the first place?Take things for granted?Complacency?<br><br>Juz my 2cents worth.</div>
