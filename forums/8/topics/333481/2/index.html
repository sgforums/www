              But instead of stopping, the 58-year-old drove away from the fatally injured motorcyclist, picked up her husband at the terminal, and went home.</p>
              <p>Yesterday, Lim wept silently in the dock as a judge sentenced her to five months' jail and banned her from driving for three years.</p>
              <p>District Judge Jill Tan said that Lim deserved a jail sentence because she did not stop to help the motorcyclist, Mr Ghazali Mohamed Noor, 47.</p>
              <p>The package officer with the Singapore Airport Terminal Services (Sats) was on his way to Changi Airport on Christmas Day morning in 2006 when he hit a car making an illegal U-turn.</p>
              <p>Mr Ghazali was flung off, landing one lane away.</p>
              <p>While he was trying to get up, Lim ran over him. She did not brake and went on to pick up her husband from Terminal 1, before heading home.</p>
              <p>Mr Ghazali suffered multiple injuries and died on the spot.</p>
              <p>Lim reported to the Traffic Police only eight days late, after being issued a letter ordering her to come in.</p>
              <p>Pleading for leniency, defence lawyer Luke Lee urged the court not to jail Lim, saying it was not clear which car inflicted the fatal blow.</p>
              <p>The driver who touched off the accident with an illegal U-turn, 64-year-old contractor Tew Hock Sew, also left the scene, only to return five minutes later after dropping off a passenger at the airport.</p>
              <p>In May this year, he was sentenced to five months' jail and banned from driving for three years for failing to help.</p>
              <p>Upon appealing two months later, his sentence was reduced to three months in jail.</p>
              <p>Mr Lee said Lim, who is out on a bail of $20,000, plans to appeal against the sentence.</p>

              <p>My experience in calling police is that they always dilly-dally one. There was once I saw a female driving knocking down a stationary motorcycle while doing reverse parking and just walked away. I went to a Neighbourhood Police Centre to make report, I waited for more than 1 and a half hours amd got myself summoned for parking at the wrong lot.</p>
              <p>Fortunately I got my summons waived but was warned that I cannot use the same reason the next time if I were caught for parking wrong lot.</p>
              <p>Very discouraging.</p>
