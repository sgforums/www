              <p>My experience in calling police is that they always dilly-dally one. There was once I saw a female driving knocking down a stationary motorcycle while doing reverse parking and just walked away. I went to a Neighbourhood Police Centre to make report, I waited for more than 1 and a half hours amd got myself summoned for parking at the wrong lot.</p>
              <p>Fortunately I got my summons waived but was warned that I cannot use the same reason the next time if I were caught for parking wrong lot.</p>

              <p>killing with a purpose becomes murder ...  no more accident ...  anyway, back to the topic...  there are so many show like "gotcha ", " candid camera ", " just for gig " etc ...  how to know you will not be made a fool for helping a victim.</p>
              <p>Then, even if I want to help and looking at the victim, it may be better not to do anything as you may a<span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black; font-family: Arial;    ">ggravated</span> the wound and sway sway because you help ... the best is to call 999 or 995.</p>
