Many of our supporters are asking whether funds that are generated from the show are going to the Singapore Cancer Society. We hope to raise $10 million this year and we intend to set aside $7million for cancer treatment. We are concerned that with another cancer charity show, the money that's going to cancer treatment will not be coming to us, " said Dr Ang Peng Thiam, medical oncologist and Vice-Chairman of the Singapore Cancer Society.<br><br>The Society is also concerned that the similarity in the names of the two charity shows may have confused the public into thinking that the two shows are the same.<br><br>The Singapore Cancer Society is an organisation with concrete plans and programmes to help cancer patients in the community.<br><br>Said Dr Koo Wen Hsin, Chairman of the Singapore Cancer Society and Head of the Medical Oncology Department at the National Cancer Centre, Singapore: "For the last 40 years, we at the Singapore Cancer Society here have been doing cancer screening programmes, public education programmes, hospice home care, and we provide a lot of public welfare for needy patients. <span style="color: red;"><strong>So all these money, every single dollar of it has been spent on these programmes</strong></span>."<br><br>Of the money raised last year, $2million has gone to help needy patients pay for expensive treatment.<br><br>The remaining $1 million went to fund cancer screening, welfare and hospice programmes.<br><br>So far 20,000 have benefited from the Society's screening programmes.<br><br>1,400 have been picked up for further cancer tests at hospitals and 9 patients have undergone operation to treat cancer.<br><br>The Society's own Cancer Charity Show airs this October.<br><br>It hopes to raise $10million, 70% of which will go to help patients pay for cancer treatment.<br><br>(source: <a href="http://channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/155361/1/.html" rel="nofollow">Channel News Asia</a>)<br><br>so, why is NKF trying to muscle in on the Singapore Cancer Society's work?  and how come NKF cannot be like the Cancer Society and use the money wisely?</div>
