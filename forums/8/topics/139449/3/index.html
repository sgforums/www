I hope they can find some cheap and larger space for the animals because they had to euthanise so many animals daily. Its sad that locals treat animals so like toys to be played with and throw away. My dad picked up pedegree cats (kitten at that time) because people abandoned it. Renci only do once a year. Not so bad. Although I find it kinda commercialised but I've seen their hospice and such. They do indeed try not to turn anyone out.<br><br>NKF is literally in everyone's face, from TV shows and donation drives, to brochers, Saturday flag selling, mailers and everything else.  NKF is so commercial but the number of people they assist is quite limited. Frankly I wonder what is the President Charity doing also. Every 2-3 months got one charity show. Every night see TV, NKF got those weepy shows to emotional blackmail people into giving. Worse is that the old folks watch these shows started to get damn paranoid about their health.<br><br>Let me promote SPCA and Mettacats:<br><br><a href="http://www.spca.org.sg/" rel="nofollow">http://www.spca.org.sg/</a><br><br><a href="http://www.mettacats.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mettacats.org/</a><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree we should donate to the Singapore Cancer Society instead of the NKF<br><br>Since we humans, esp those in Singapore, cause untold suffering and misery to defenceless animals, we should do more to help them lah. I think mistyblue was just trying to highlight the plight of these animals, lost and neglected admist all the glitz and gala from the NKF and President's Charity.<br><br>OT:<br><br>"The more people I meet, the more I want to get a dog",<br>Gary Sinise on CSI New York.
