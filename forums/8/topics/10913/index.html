            <div class='col-md body'>The fact is that less and less of such things are happening nowadays...<br><br>in China, killing of babies are also not happening as often... what FI was quoted saying is probably more common 10 years ago than now, and another thing, farming families in china do hv the rights to give birth to more than 1 kid... in fact, there are no limits for farmers...<br><br>In s'pore, it is also becoming less common... take my family for eg... my family is quite traditional, and my father do expect a lot fm my brother and myself, but he dotes on my sister more...<br><br>and my sister, she is a typical smatrt woman who looks down on man.... she just completed her EEE masters, and when I ask her why she did EEE, she said she just wanted to prove that what the guys can do, girls can do also...<br><br>and now, she is not even working as an engineer or something... she is helping in my dad's business, and also g it better along the way...<br><br>but talking about equality between sexes, I seriously dun think its possible, and in fact, many woman do put people of their own sexes down...<br><br>which reminds me of one chinese song: "Nu sheng bu gai qi fu nu sheng", meaning, girls shouldn't bully girls... quite true isn't it!?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Whens the end coming?

            <div class='col-md body'>I think all these Zhong Nan Qing Nu are bullshit lah....bite your thumb and last finger and tell me which hurts more...it is the same.<br><br>In ancient China, girls do not get educated because it will be the guys who will have to work and support the family later in life due to the society structure then. Those rich family daughters still have the chance to learn things and in poorer families the family usually will have to sacrifice the gers chances to get educated coz they are POOR; not becoz they dun see the need.<br><br>------------------<br>Where is Montgomery?

            <div class='col-md body'>Dun think both sexes can be equal. Both have their own "specialities" and behave gernerally differently. However, in terms of academic strenghts, i suppose its true to a certain extend to say that both sexes are almost on par, except that majority of one sex may excel in a sepcific field more that the other... I wish I had a sister though. Living in a home with all guys really isnt a very interesting thing to do. I am one who dont really care which sex is better or stronger or smarter. Just live your life the way you want to. Dosent really matter.<br>Just my 2 cents...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>Comments?</div>
