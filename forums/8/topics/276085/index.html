            <div class='col-md body'>EmailCashPro (in short ECP) is a service where you get paid to read emails. Each email you read earns you 1 point. These points are converted into cash every first week of the month. The rate of conversion is 1 point for 0.55 cents to 0.75 cents, depending on how much they earn.<br><br>Now if you are thinking I'm going to post my referral link here and have you to click it, you are wrong.<br><br>When you first start, they only send you a few paid emails to read every month (as they claimed on their website). Alright lets say you get to click one paid email everyday. That totals up to 30 points by the end of the month, and when it's converted to cash, it's about 20 cents. The minimum amount to request cash-out is $11 minus $1 processing fee. That will take years, and it isn't worth it.<br><br>Luckily there's a faster way, which is to refer others to join. When you use others to join, you get 50% of what they earned. Simply put, if the person gets 30 points, you get to receive extra 15 points (the person won't lose anything). Let's say you referred 10 people to join, and they all earn 30 points each per month. You get extra 150 points + 30 points you earned for yourself. That's just slightly more than 1 dollar per month when converted to cash, which is still slow.<br><br>There's still a faster way, which is the 4 level referral system. Sounds confusing? I'm going to explain it in simpler terms. A referred B to join, B then referred C to join, C then referred D to join, D then referred E to join.<br><br>A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; D -&gt; E<br><br>A will receive 50% of what B earned. (without B losing any points)<br>A will also receive 20% of what C earned. (without C losing any points)<br>A will also receive 10% of what D earned. (without D losing any points)<br>A will also receive  5% of what E earned. (without E losing any points)<br><br>B will receive 50% of what C earned. (without C losing any points)<br>B will receive 20% of what D earned. (without D losing any points)<br>B will receive 10% of what E earned. (without E losing any points)<br><br>and so on and so forth.<br><br>Let's say A referred 10 people to join, these 10 people then referred 100 people, these 100 people then referred 1000 people, these 1000 people then referred 10000 people, these 10000 people then referred 100000 people (which won't happen since they don't even have 75000 members now)<br><br>A -&gt; 10 (level 1) -&gt; 100 (level 2) -&gt; 1000 (level 3) -&gt; 10000 (level 4) -&gt; 100000 -&gt; (level 5)<br><br>Yes, A will be earning alot, but not for long. As more and more people join ECP, it's harder and harder to refer anybody since most people already joined. Those people on level 5 who can't refer anybody will only earn 20 cents per month, and sooner or later they will quit.<br><br>Now those people on level 4 will be affected since people on level 5 has quit and isn't earning anything. People on level 4 also will be earning 20 cents per month. And as more people quit, A will be affected. Finally, he will also be earning the pathetic 20 cents per month.<br><br>Of course this is just a example scenario, some might refer 5, some 10, some 15, some even 50. But the end effect is the same, ECP will collapse one day.<br><br>Unlike a pyramid scheme which has no end benefit (except to the creator), ECP actually has some. Like you get to keep up to the market and get some offers, and the advertisers get to reach out to the public.<br><br>Alot of people actually join ECP because they never knew they could earn money online.<br><br>This is just my personal opinions.</div>
