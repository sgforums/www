            <div class='col-md body'>Actually besides this movie, another movie I like is Flatliners. It is about the conquering of each individual innermost evil and how to come to grips with it. It is all about one's ability to overcome their fear and peace there will come thereafter.<br><br>To me, it seems like karma stuff about evil deeds done in the past and having to come to terms with it. All these are pretty much to be done within oneself. Only people who can't cope with it will look for some other divine beings to shoulder the blame or fear etc for them.<br><br>And it does not matter  that more movies touching on Buddhism principles are made. Reincarnation, rebirth, karma, enlightenment etc. Reflect upon it and they will make sense to you gradually in your everyday lives.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkblue;"><br>hi sohguanh,<br><br>i did watch the movie, it is ok, i switch between jacky "wu shi zhi lu kou" and the movie. I am not sure if i understand the whole show or what the movie is trying to focus... what i know is that it is trying to said that the churches now reject this so-called found "gospel" of st thomas which is found around 1940's.<br><br>personally i like the movies the little buddha, damo(taiwan), the 10 commandments, matrix, warlord, damien, 6th sense, dragonfly, rama(indian), indiana jones part III and much more. One thing i would like to said is that in all the spiritual movies that we have seen, be it whichever religion, in the end it is always good wins over evil... what it teaches? evil never win... i guess people who watch movies should get this into their heart and mind, this is what we should learn...<br><br>karma, enlightenment, rebirth, reincarnation - not many ppl can understand, even me myself.<br><br>btw, the next movie i am watching will be "the touch".<br></span></div>
