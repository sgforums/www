              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><strong>The teenage daughter of incoming New York mayor Bill de Biasio has made startling revelations.</strong></p>
              <p>Mr Chiara de Blasio said on Tuesday that she underwent treatment for depression and drug and alcohol abuse over the past year, the New York Daily News reported.</p>
              <p>   "My mum was trying really hard to help me, any little thing she could, and my dad was doing the same. But obviously, he was really busy. But they were very emotionally committed to some way to get me better," she said in a five-minute video.</p>
              <p>   For months, her father's aides refused to comment on reports that his daughter had been treated for substance abuse.</p>
              <p>   By authorising the video, which was posted on YouTube by his transition team, the family was able to tell the sensitive story on its own terms as the mayor-elect prepares to take office on Jan 1.</p>
              <p>   Two hours after the video's release, Mr de Blasio, Democrat, wrapped his right arm around his college sophomore daughter and expressed his support.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; color: #0070c0; font-size: 16pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">DEPRESSION</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She said she had depression her entire adolescence and had abused weed and alcohol to cope.</p>
              <p>   "I just want to say that we are incredibly proud of Chiara," said the mayor-elect, who was his wife Chirlane and son Dante, in a show of family unity outside their Park Slope, Brooklyn, row house.</p>
              <p>   He praised his daughter for speaking "with incredible courage and clarity, and with a voice, I think, of just incredible wisdom for someone who's only 19 years old."</p>
              <p>   The daughter, who spoke briefly, said: "I hope that everyone watches the video. I think it speaks for itself."</p>
              <p>   She wished the assembled media and a live television audience a "happy holiday season" before the family turned and walked back into their home.</p>
