Is the pilot really in the fault??<br><br>My uncle who works in this field told me that such an exeprienced pilot couldn't make such a mistake. Mind you, this pilot is a very experienced one. And in case you dunno, before a plane goes on a runaway, computerised systems will tell if that runaway is available. And on that night, it is obvious that the runwaway is not for use. So why the hell did the pilot still choose that runaway when the system info couldn't match? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah! I believe what we see and hear in the news are just stories made up by them. But why the hell did the pilot choose to take the blame. No justice man. The truth should be out as it not only concerns on the reputation of Taiwan's airport.. cos I think they owe the victim's family a honest and truthful explanation!!</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>The only logic which i can come up with for SIA to shoulder the responsibility totally is that if they try to deny or shrugg off the responsibility, the victim's family may ask for a higher compensation. In a way, it's quite smart of SIA to take 100% blame. It is better to accept the blame now and if after this, investigation reveals that SIA is not totally at fault, people will think that "Aiyah, I shouldn't have blame SIA totally initally".</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've just seen the report on 8pm just now. What is Taiwan authorities trying to do!! They're obviously trying to put the blame on the pilot!! According to the latest report, the pilot did not use that runway before in his flying history. And the Taiwan authoritites keep emphasing on the pilot itself, but not on the Taiwan Airport. Damn it!!</div>
