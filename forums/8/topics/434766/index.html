              <p>Anybody here studied in TMC Education before?</p>
              <p>Come share your experiences studying there.</p>
              <p>I studied there and I can tell you the experience sucks.</p>
              <p>Firstly, there is high resignation rates among for the lecturers. You could have a few different lecturers for 1 subject. The lecturers just keep changing because the old lecturers resign and they employ new lecturers.</p>
              <p>They cannot employ singaporeans lecturers who are all working in MOE schools so they end up employing foreign lecturers. Some of these foreign lecturers speak with a accent and you have difficulty understanding them.</p>
              <p>There is no coordination between the staffs from the exam department and the lecturers.</p>
              <p>Sometimes the lecturers give you an extension of deadline to submit your project but the exam department does not want to accept your project, claiming that it is submitted past the deadline.</p>
              <p>When you tell them your lecturer give you extension, they will say your lecturer give you wrong information or your lecturer is not authorised to do so and still don't accept your project.</p>
              <p>Because of the high staff turnover rate, they even made all new staffs including admin and teaching staffs sign a 1 year bond and if they resign within 1 year, they must pay 2 months salary.</p>
              <p>Even if they terminate the staff, they will make them pay 2 months salary.</p>
              <p>Many of the staffs there hate the job and have no motivation to work and is just waiting for the 1 year bond to end</p>
              <p>I googled on the internet and found a posting describing the horrific experience studying at TMc Education</p>

              <p>Quoted:</p>
              <p>I'm at TMC now, doing Monash. Lecturers suck, the coordinators are lousy too. The old batch of coordinators left and the new batch are really horrible.<br><br>Worse is the Australian lecturers suck too! You email them and ask about something, they either take forever to reply you or no replies at all. T<br><br>They screwed up my exams, not once but three times! One term, they gave me the wrong dates for the exams! I end up having to retake the papers through no fault of my own. <br><br>2nd and 3rd time, in different terms, they had errors in the exam papers! During the exams, we highlighted to the invigilators and they said Monash said the papers were alright. A few days later, Monash said sorry! they discovered the error!!! I've no idea how they graded the papers. <br><br>And plus I do believe that they're very nationalist.<br>They've this thinking that Australia should rule the world! Many of my classmates think so too, from the comments and markings they gave Sporean students.<br><br>Yes even though they're 8 hours flight time away, and even though I've never met them before, they still managed to piss us off. <br><br>So I really wouldn't recommend TMC or Monash in any other private schools.</p>
