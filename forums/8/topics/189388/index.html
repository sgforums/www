            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Official American Idol thread until May 24th finale</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">FireIce: Please do not delete/close this. Close my other one instead if you wish. (it's not getting much response)</span><br><br>My take on this year's idol:<br><br>Judging from the Final 4 this year &amp; comparing it with last season's, it's completely fuc<strong></strong>ked up. So much for undeserving idols, i wonder if this year's winner will somewhat suffer the same fate as past winner Ruben Studdard.<br><br>Taking a closer look at the final 4, none of them can hold a candle to any of last seaon's final 4. Chris Daughtry is nowhere near Bo Bice with regards to authentic-ness &amp; wow factor in his performances. Although the judges sing praises towards Chris, it was for the wrong reasons - because the other remaining contestants couldn't even measure up to his already low standard (He's the best out of the remaining idols). His fashion sense is almost like what a typical singaporean teenage rockstar wannabe would wear. Every week without fail, his outfit would consist of two of these three items - a silver chain, leather jacket/suit/pants or a spiked wristband. Bo Bice is different in this aspect. At least his performances are something to look forward to, like his signature song 'I don't wanna be' &amp; his rendition of 'Inside your heaven.'<br><br>Taylor Hicks is another fluke who's gained popularity for the wrong reasons - similar to Chris. It's clear that he doesn't have any star quality. Some might argue that he has a unique, rough &amp; sexy voice but the truth is, with his vocal range, his choice of songs are very limited, showing lack of versatility. He needs to be constantly reminded that this is not a dancing competition but a singing competition. His dance moves aren't fantastic at all but instead he looks like a lunatic on estacy. If you didnt know already, taylor has released albums before signing up with idol. Perhaps that's the reason voters could take a listen to his old tracks (which might not be good) &amp; vote for him. To me, that's an unfair advantage. The reason whyt his matured appearance has brought him so far for a programme mostly targetted to the younger generation remains a question.<br><br>Elliot is merely another much faded copy of the R&amp;B soul singer fantasia barrino (who is also a comlete failure - you never heard her since her departure from idol). Doubled by his hideous dance moves in his performance "i don't wanna be" &amp; also not forgetting his out of the ordinary physical appearances, it only makes him less worthy of becoming the next idol. True that dancing is not what determines the victory of this competition, but his looks simply turns me, &amp; many other people off. When he first auditioned, with his nearly bald hair, screwed up teeth &amp; pointed ears, he looks almost like a cross between a chipmunk &amp; a grinning leprechaun guarding over his pot of gold. If he wins this, i hope he gets a makeover before publishing his album with his face on it. His far from unique vocals is his only plus point &amp; it is predictable that he'll be out next week.<br><br>Lastly, i find Katharine rather fake. Like Elliot, her performances are also highly inconsistant. Her wardrobe malfuntion is just one of her tricks to obtain more votes for herself as it's apparent that she fears that she will be beaten by her competitors the other night. Notice that her song choice hovers more between the pop &amp; blues range, for example during Queen week. Although that particular performance was good, it shows that her versitility is also limited. Besides that, i dont think she can measure up to last year's winner.<br><br>It makes me wonder why Taylor can manage to outlast strong contestants like Mandisa the R&amp;B diva who exhibits great talent, Kellie Pickler the innocent &amp; bubbly blonde country girl &amp; Ace Young, undeniably the hottest heartthrob who can actually sing fairly well. Perhaps people didn't like Mandisa's obesity, Ace's hair (i find it quite hot!!) &amp; Kellie's 'dumb blonde act' which i believe isn't to gain more votes but rather her innocence. much to my disappointment, none of them made it past top 5.<br><br>A flashback to last season's idol, Scott (the contestant who looks like shrek) mananged to clinge top 5, beating Constantine Maroulis who has never been in the bottom 3 &amp; happens to make a wrong song choice that night. He's my all-time favourite by the way.. If you've watch last year's idol, you'd have realised how lousy this Scott is. Like taylor.<br><br>My predictions are as follows..<br>Top 3 - Katharine, Taylor &amp; Chris<br>Top 2 - Taylor &amp; Chris<br>Winner - Chris</div>
