I have nothing against FTs if they're better and deserve the position....and I do like having different kinds of people around - makes life more interesting and colourful.

Those at the bottom of the food chain of course i.e. the junior civil servants who are not being paid that much to begin with. The highly paid ministers, MPs, and superscale key appointment holders are safe. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>There are also quite a lot of companies that are now refusing to pay the employer's cpf contribution for their employees, esp the lower level ones. They are given the option of accepting it, or retrenchment. Many cleaning ladies at my place tell me they get no CPF contribution from employer but are too afraid to complain to MOM for fear of losing their jobs later.</div>
