            <div class='col-md body'>So the young people study so hard for a degree just to get to drive a taxi for the FT...<br>That's so inspiring...  I was advising a O level person about getting further studies... and my emphasis was : get a job because its harder now plus there is just too much competition. Irony....<br><br>So when take home $ is approximately 1k but according to the statistics (I call them lies but I'd be sued for slander by emperor Lee) the cost of living is lower now than before (and no guesses which is the benchmark year) ...  I guess we must thank Seng Song for giving the poor people cheap groceries .<br><br>I remember the 80s (and it was no so long ago) that flats cost 5 digits. In just a couple of short years, it shot into 6 digits... I don't know but I still don't understand how the construction industry can collaspe/do badly with such high profits, where HDB can spin off companies and prefab houses/pigeon-holes that are now getting smaller are costing us more $.  We pay and pay and pay for everything, but get this... far far down the road in the future's future... eventually, the house still belong to the govt. . in fact, everything we own will eventually go back to the govt...<br><br>Having a local govt who don't care about the people and having a virtual govt perhaps in india/china or even north pole, who also don't care about the people and yet cost us less to employ them... well... there's just logical isn't it.  But then, there's nepotism, there's protectionism for their jobs (but not ours) and there's just perhaps corruption, collusion and etc but the public is only fed propaganda and glorified messages of the great govt and its caring policies...<br><br>But, looking into the crystal ball, if nothing change in the system, one day, singapore will be just be full of FT and there will be no one reporting for NS cause there are no "locals" left. Then I hope the north country will take back the land since there will be no one defending it and the FT all fled quickly when there is trouble. But if there is a system change where if we ever, ever get to vote (and not the manipulative walk overs) then perhaps something will change.<br><br>So are we getting that casino? Seriously from the first day the subject was broached, I already know the govt will go for it.. cause it generate $$$ for them.   Then after so many months of wah yang... its back to sq 1. Face it, its still an autocratic govt pretending to be "democratic".  The govt knows that it needs to generate jobs, $ for people. Casino is the easy way ... once there is so call "good" life for the people, PAP will get voted back and "confidence" will restore. Then whatever bad policies and money sucking they do during these good times will be over looked like before during the "boom" years.  But now its a bit different... people got cynical ...  no matter what the govt do, most of us lost our trust in them for protecting locals ... If you ask me, I feel like I live on 'Animal Farm' (George Orwell) and I am one of the animals that is squeezed dry for any profits till the day I die.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thats why using only the CPI and GDP to measure how well the economy is doing is one big joke. Unemployment rate is also very misleading.<br><br>I'll eat my shorts if the government decides not to build a casino. The "debate" is really an exercise to convince those against the idea.<br>The refusal to lift the party whip for a real debate in parliament speaks volumes.<br><br>Its not just Animal Farm, its more like Animal Farm + 1984.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There are two senarios when FTs are brought in:<br><br>Service industry jobs.  Many of our locals cannot tahan facing customers and get scolded by angry customers from time to time.  In the past, all call centers hire locals (maybe a few Malaysians).  But the local don't stay long in the job.  So they have to travel to Philippines for recruitment and interviews.  This is so in two companies that I know.<br><br>In this case, ok lah.  FTs are accepted lah.<br><br>But hor....<br>In many other companies, IT engineers are retrenched and replaced by Indians IT specialists, cuz the Indians are just as good (they study the same IT stuff as those in Singapore, I suppose), but ask for cheaper pay.  This is a growing trend.  And I find it very scary.  I'm sure there are other jobs affected this way.<br><br>Now I even see gahmen doing all kinds of stuff and pumping in money to make FTs stay, esp those from China.  Frankly China ppl don't like it here one.  They make enough money here, they go back.  The gahmen still haven't wake up.<br><br>We all leh?  Most of us want to stay here one.  Yah lah, many tok cok one will say migrate migrate.  But how many actually want to do it?  At the end of the day, most of us want to stay here.

The future is going to be service driven.. We cannot always rely on "FT" to do our  "dirty" work just cause its "more difficult" or we cannot take critism.. its reflecting badly that we see ourselves so highly we expect others to serve us hand and foot.<br>The other aspect about service is tat locals who use the service got to learn how to treat the people who serve with respect as well as handle themselves and not complain at every little thing.<br><br>Everything in any company can be outsourced. Everything is dispensible. It depends on what the company sees as important. My IT company will soon only have sales and marketting. The rest are outsourced. So its not just IT although IT was the easiest to get rid. However, there is a theory of a frog system and a bicycle system. Some systems like a bike can be taken apart and put back together with no loss of function. Some systems like frogs, you can remove part by part, and the frog will still live. But once too much is removed, the frog will die regardless of what parts is put back.. The companies are blindly following without proper studies. The chase for lowering cost.. it might come to a collaspe point where people are all so poorly paid, no one can afford anything.<br><br>For everyone, every FT I encounter is just in Singapore for the $ and the easy policies which actually made their lives easy but made locals 2nd class. It is a fact, everyone of the FT I know, most do not like the country, thinks the govt and the system so rigid and inflexible. There is no freedom and too much fear of the govt actions. Most will take whatever they can from this place without putting anything back. And most do not ever in their time here feel this is their home.<br>But now, even if the govt back out on FT policies or tighten it. the damage is already done. ppl had lost their hearts and souls and the govt system has now morphed into a blood and money sucking self serving monster.<br><br></div>
