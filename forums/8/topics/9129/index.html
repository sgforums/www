My wife does not dress cheaply and I don't think that women dress cheaply.  They choose to reveal a little more skin to attract men.  That doesn't make them sluts and neither does it justify saying that they dress cheaply.<br><br>Read carefully my previous post.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe the topic is quite true to some aspect lah.  I don't think "cheap" should be the term to use.  Rather I think some of us, ladies and guys, have very bad dress sense.  A lot of them are influenced by what the media portrays as "fashion".  So "innocent" youths, and sometimes adults, try all means and ways to get designers in their effort to look "cool" or emulate their idols.  No matter what, we are not in the position to say whether they are "cheap" or not mah.<br><br>It doesn't matter how we view their dressing.  No matter how revealing they are dressed, this doesn't gives anyone the rights to do anything harmful to them mah.</div>
