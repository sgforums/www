              <p>wa lao... dont b so racist leh...</p>
              <p>whenever PRC come up with some negative online comments about SG, we get so worked up and angry... and now, you go and do the same and come up with come lousy racist thread like this.... how can likedat??!!</p>
              <p>i suggest all of us here to be more understanding and open minded about PRC whether in china, SG or anywhere in the world... take the trouble to make frens with them and to understand their point of view better</p>
              <p>i spend a lot of time in china and i can tell you its never as bad as you make it to be</p>
              <p>just slightly over 30 years ago, their country GDP was the same size as Malawi, a little country in Africa.. today it is no. 2 in the world... if within one generation the enviornment and the economy change that much, of cos you will also take time to adjust... and the world will also take time to adjust to you</p>
              <p>just as SG in the past got courtesy campaign when we change and develop rapidly in the early years, same promotion and campaign is on-going everywhere in china.. it will take time but i can almost say with certainty that the situation will improve</p>
              <p>peace out</p>

              <p>Wait till you go to China. I got scolded for nothing when I was
              in China. I wanted to argue with that man but my friend stopped me
              as I was not local and who knows what would happen. He scolded me
              because I did not call him å¸ˆå‚…(he was a security guard) when I asked
              for direction to the toilet in his building. He scolded me for a

              that in their country the practice is to call a security
              guard  å¸ˆå‚…. I refused to call just because of a toilet.</p>

              <p><br>yah, standing in front of others to block their view is high survival instincts. take dirty plate from their own table put at other people table is survival instincts. yell for your friend at the top of your voice when you're standing beside someone is survival instincts.</p>
              <p>Notice if you swap the word "survival instincts" with "rude/inconsiderate/uncultured", the sentences above seem more correct.</p>
              <p>I would not say it's survival instincts because as far as i know, singaporeans and westeners have a longer lifespan compared to people from china.</p>

              <p>alamak, we're talking about the ratio here... if you want to go without ratio, then logic is flawed. 1 guy can jump down from a 9 storey building, survived it, so he can say jump down from 9 storey high is totally safe, because he survived it, but how many people can survive a 9 storey high fall???</p>
              <p>for every 1 survivor, there can be 30 deaths.</p>
              <p>similarly for every 1 rude singaporean, there might be many nice gracious ones. singaporeans are generally helpful and kind hearted. i have never stated there are no rude singaporeans because we know that is not true. but i was stating the experiences within 1 week with those people and the ratio of rude people vs kind people of that nationality is really sad.</p>
              <p>i'm not racist as i'm a chinese myself, why would i go scolding my own race. but facts are facts, if a chinese beat up a malay guy for no reason, i would help the malay guy. it's not about the race here, it's about the attitude and character of the people.</p>
              <p>if you give way to someone, you generally think he will appreciate the gesture but instead he push you and block your view, now that's unacceptable behavior.</p>

              <p>anyway, let me share some unpleasant scenrio during my trip too.</p>
              <p>on my way back from Emei Shan to Chengdu on a local tour group, the bus was already packed.</p>
              <p>the driver was trying to save money and did not switch on the aircon..  we had to open the window for some air....  the driver earned side $ by picking up more passenger to piggyride on our chartered bus..  one particular father and son pair took our seats.</p>
              <p>all of us were sweating like mad.. we told them to open up the windows as least we (the paying tourists) get some ventilation..   he ignored us and told us he did not want his hair ruffled..  </p>
              <p>that was the last straw, I stood up (towering over him) and told him loudly (so whole bus tourists can hear), if he continued to be so selfish and , he would be kicked out of the bus on the dark highway, This bus was solely chartered by us.!</p>
              <p>He was shocked and obliged.. he was not happy but kept very quiet, his poor son was so embrassed and apologised many times.. we forgave the son but not the father..</p>
              <p>Different culture, different places bred different people...</p>
              <p>.....................</p>
              <p>Even at holiest temples at Tibet, where their most upmost respected diety is rested in front of them!  They literally pushed and cursed at their own fellow people loudly on the same holy ground,  they can jump queue and get what they want 1st....  and they were supposed to learn to be "pure heart", "be gracious", "forgiveness" and attain alightenment!!....... where dieties are watching on them...around them!!</p>

              <p>in any case, i dun want to argue lah, waste your time, waste my time, i just want to say, those were my personal experiences with them, not representative of all china men... i understand got nice china people too. the thread was created to release my anger because of those 3 stupid experiences with those china people, spoilt the whole image.</p>
              <p>my title could have been more appropriate, but my 3 experiences were on china men, lol, so initially first thought come to put as title is rude china men, lol...</p>
