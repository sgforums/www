              <p>Experience 1 - Eating at food court. Behind my table, someone ate and left, so the plate with bones on the table behind me. 3 china men came and 1 of them took the dirty plate with bones and put on my table, while I was still eating my meal halfway. So rude! That's what I said to them and when I left, I pushed my chair to hit them letting them know someone not happy with their rudeness.</p>
              <p>Experience 2 - Watching a performance. A china man walking from my right side wanted to see so I give way so he can see also. He walk directly in front of me, and stopped there, blocking my entire view. Wah lao, I give way and he stand directly in front of me to block me, ungrateful bastard. So I walk to beside him, body check him and bang him to the left, just like in soccer. He looked at me and I looked at him like he's a cockroach coz I really want to beat him up.</p>
              <p>Experience 3 - Store entrace is about 1.5 metres wide. I was standing at the extreme left of the entrance looking at their stuff. There is a huge space on my right side of the store entrance. Anyone with a certain level of intelligence know that to get into the store, you can walk through the remaining 1.2 metre of big free space, but nooo, China man has to brush against my back like very squeeze like that to get into the store. Really so rude and so stupid.</p>
              <p>I wonder how their family brought up these people, so lack of manners and social grace, it really reflects very badly on their whole family. But to be fair, these are the minority of China men maybe, but I don't see such stupid stuff very often in Singaporean chinese/malay/indians or westeners. I'm really proud of the education Singaporeans have, maybe that's the main difference, but my experience with china men over the last week leaves me feeling some of them are like wild dogs, need to be disciplined or removed from society.</p>

              <p>I mean I lived my whole life in singapore and i dun see such stupid stuff happening very much from the singaporean chinese/indians/malay but just 1 week vacation and i see all these nonsense from the china men. btw, i can tell they are china men due to their dialects, i can understand a few languages.</p>
              <p>and of coz, their favorite was to shout. never mind if you're beside them, they will shout to their friends/family about 2 metres away. so rude!</p>

              <p>Those who haven't had university education tend to behave like that....not that I mean to be judgmental but this is what I've noticed. Quite a number of pleasant ones really. The others are pheasants, peasants...... whatever.</p>

              <p>I mean I lived my whole life in singapore and i dun see such stupid stuff happening very much from the singaporean chinese/indians/malay but just 1 week vacation and i see all these nonsense from the china men. btw, i can tell they are china men due to their dialects, i can understand a few languages.</p>
              <p>and of coz, their favorite was to shout. never mind if you're beside them, they will shout to their friends/family about 2 metres away. so rude!</p>
