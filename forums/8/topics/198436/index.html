The next best thing is to learn how to control one's temper next time, it's a really hard thing to do though. Some people are still slaves to their temper, but those who managed to take control of their emotions are well, should I say more well liked and respected?<br><br>There's no point dwelling over what already happened. Seriously you didn't fare too bad what you did, some guy would have shown twice the amount of middle finger you did, but violence is not encouraged in Singapore. Even if 1 is in the right, they may still be punished under the law when serious conflict arises.<br><br>Like I say, it's not easy to keep one's emotion under control, those who can do that are truly amazing.</div>
