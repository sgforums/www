They had noticed that br3ast cancer was literally non-existent in Fiji before World War Two, but after the "liberation" of Fiji, some of the professional and working women adopted the "Western" styles of clothing and began wearing bras to their work.<br><br>Their study showed that br3ast cancer was still quite rare among half the women's population (the ones that did not change from their original style of dress). There have been a steadily increasing number of women that are developing br3ast cancer among those that have taken up the new fashion styles and are wearing bras. The "more modern" women that have started wearing bras (which did not exist in the traditional Fijian clothing) may live in the same village or home, eat the same food, share the same genetic background and environment as the traditionally dressed women, but they are the ones developing br3ast disease.<br><br>As a result of Singer and Grismaijer's Bra and Br3ast Cancer study, information about the health risks of wearing a bra has been disseminated on national television and radio, and is published in the "Fiji Times". Fiji now recognizes Breast Cancer Awareness Week, which now includes warnings about the wearing of bras</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Researchers looking into the causes of br3ast cancer, a disease<br>tragically common among women in Western countries, may have<br>overlooked the most obvious cause of all: the wearing of bras.<br><br>So says the husband-and-wife team of Sydney Ross Singer and Soma Grismaijer,whose 1995 book Dressed to Kill: The Link Between Br3ast Cancer andBras (Avery Publishing) is based on their own personal experiences and<br>research. (Scientific studies suggest that the difference in diet<br>between North American and Japanese women accounts for the much-higher<br>br3ast cancer rates in the former group.)<br><br>As described in the August 1995 New Age Journal, the book authors' theory is that "when the br3ast is chronically restricted by a bra, the lymph system that<br>surrounds it may become blocked -- preventing it from carrying out its<br>function of removing toxins from the area, and thus making cancer more<br>likely." Surveying almost 5,000 women in major cities in the United<br>States, they claim to have found that women who wore their bras so<br>tightly as to cause red marks on their skin, or wore bras more than 12<br>hours a day, were much more likely to have contracted br3ast cancer.<br><br>Interviewed by the San Jose (California) Metro (July 6, 1995), Singer,<br>a medical anthropologist, mused on the cultural significance of bras<br>in Western society: "They're really invested in wearing bras, women<br>identify with their br3asts so much. Can they stop wearing bras if it<br>meant saving their lives?"<br><br>A spokesperson for the National Cancer Institute responds: "We look<br>forward to the publication of the Bra and Br3ast Cancer Study in a<br>peer-reviewed scientific journal, where the study results can be<br>properly evaluated."<br><br><a href="http://lists.isb.sdnpk.org/pipermail/health-list-old/1998-March/000866.html" rel="nofollow">http://lists.isb.sdnpk.org/pipermail/health-list-old/1998-March/000866.html</a></div>

We are told that "unsupported br3asts will pull on internal components and that it will be painful." Actually, the truth of the matter is that the support from a bra will relieve the internal tension from the suspensory (Cooper's) ligaments that pull inward from the inside of the skin of the br3ast, but that is not necessarily good. Some ligaments are actually formed like a basket (or like a brassiere) inside of the br3ast, to cradle the br3ast and support it. Constant, unnatural, external support from the bra will allow the ligaments to atrophy. If the ligaments are allowed to weaken from the lack of use, they will become sore when they are later required to fulfill their designed purpose of supporting the br3ast.<br><br>In our society today, most br3asts are bound in bras, and thus are supported from their earliest signs of development, which prevents their ligaments from developing (from puberty onward) and enabling them to do their natural job. If you have ever decided to get back into running after a long hiatus, have you ever noticed that ligaments and muscles in your legs and feet are weak and become tired quickly? What would you have if you artificially supported the weight of your body during that time of not running, so that the ligaments and muscles in your legs and back would not have had to support you? You could not have done that and still be able to run now. Your ligaments and muscles would have atrophied. If you had continually used those ligaments and muscles in your legsÂ… if you had ALLOWED them to do their jobÂ… the tension and weight bearing derived from running would have caused the ligaments to get stronger and to stop giving pain. Women that do not wear a bra daily have ligaments that become stronger through use, therefore minimizing the pain and usually providing more natural lift.<br></div>
