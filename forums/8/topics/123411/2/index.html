            <div class='col-md body'>Well, beating someone up is definitely criminal assault which is, of course, an arrestable criminal offence.<br><br>But i guess in most cases whereby the victim is not injured or only mildly hurt, the police will generally not bother to launch a full-fledged investigation and prosecute the culprit in court, with all the work involved, though technically, they are duty-bound to do so.<br>Therefore they find out from the victim if he insists on pressing charges on the culprit. Of course they hope that u'll say no so that they can file the case off as "victim not willing to testify therefore can't proceed" or something. Well after all, not all policemen are <span style="font-style: italic;">that</span> passionate about bringing criminals to justice u know, especially when it means more work to do during their shift.<br><br>Ok, the above is just my guess of what actually goes on in the police force, perhaps someone who has worked in the force before can clarify.<br><br>Anyway, all criminal prosecution is handled by the public prosecutor, which means as the victim, u do not have to pay a single cent or engage a lawyer. This is unlike a civil suit (defamation, for instance) where the plaintiff will need to engage the services of a lawyer in order to sue the other party in court.<br></div>

Thats nice to know. But before you make a sweeping statement such as <strong>bunch of freeloaders</strong>, kindly look around you and be more objective.  You live in a safe country compared to other countries. I lived in Canada and the states for about 3 years and I can honestly tell you that it is a far cry from what you have here in Singapore. Its easy to comment on people and things. If you do honestly think that the Police are just a bunch of freeloaders and you look down on them, why don't you take the challenge of enforcing the law?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

When things go wrong, people are quick to point an accusing finger at others. However, where is the appreciation for work well done?</div>

To each his own I would say. No matter what you think, there is always a minimum acceptable standard for every profession, be it blue or white collared.<br>As for abuse of power or not doing their job well, there will always be black sheep in every organisation, like it or not and the SPF is no exception.
