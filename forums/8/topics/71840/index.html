            <div class='col-md body'>One of the biggest problems I had when starting guitar was figuring out what I should do with the thing. I didn?t have anyone to teach me. All I had was my guitar and amp. All I could think of to do was go to the Internet and search for something to learn. So I did, and I found this site. The only problem was there were so many tabs I didn?t know what to do with them all. That?s why I'm writing this article. The purpose of this article to give beginners advice on what songs they should try to learn first, and give them some exercises and advice so they can get on their way to becoming an excellent guitarist.<br><br>When I started playing I just got some tabs and started learning. In retrospect, I think it would have been better to develop my picking and fingering skills first, so I recommend that you start off by playing some simple scales and exercises so you get used to using those forgotten muscles in your fingers. Here are a few starting exercises to get started with.<br><br>|--------------------|--1-2-1------------|<br>|-----------------1--|2-------2-1-------|<br>|-------------1-2---|-------------2-1---|<br>|---------1-2-------|----------------etc|<br>|-----1-2-----------|--------------------|<br>|-1-2---------------|--------------------|<br><br>This is a simple exercise to help you get a feel for the neck and picking. You only use two fingers. Then use three fingers and play three notes per string, and when you are comfortable with that. Start using four, as shown below.<br><br>|--------------------------------------|----------5-6-7-8-9-8-7-6----------|<br>|--------------------------------------|5-6-7-8--------------------9-8-7-6-|<br>|-----------------------------5-6-7-8|---------------------------------------|<br>|-------------------5-6-7-8----------|---------------------------------------|<br>|----------5-6-7-8-------------------|---------------------------------------|<br>|-5-6-7-8----------------------------|---------------------------------------|<br><br>|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------<br>|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------<br>|-9-8-7-6-----------------------------|--------------------------------7-8-9-10-<br>|----------9-8-7-6--------------------|---------------------7-8-9-10------------<br>|-------------------9-8-7-6-----------|----------7-8-9-10----------------------<br>|-----------------------------9-8-7-6-|7-8-9-10--------------------------------<br><br>You should use that as a warm up before you play. And as that gets more and more comfortable, you can start doing your own variations on it. Like the one shown below.<br><br>|-------------------------------------|----------5-7-6-8--------------------|<br>|-------------------------------------|-5-7-6-8-----------5-7-6-8---------|<br>|----------------------------5-7-6-8-|-----------------------------5-7-6-8-|<br>|-------------------5-7-6-8----------|--------------------------------------|<br>|----------5-7-6-8-------------------|--------------------------------------|<br>|-5-7-6-8----------------------------|--------------------------------------|<br><br>Now you want to start with some simple power chords. They are tabbed below. For now you just want to get your fingers in place, and focus on changing from chord to chord quickly. You should pick up power chords fairly fast.<br>|---------------------|-------------------|<br>|---------------------|-------------------|<br>|---------------------|---2--------------|<br>|---2---3---5---7---|---2--------------|<br>|---2---3---5---7---|---0--------------|<br>|---0---1---3---5---|------------------|<br><br>Once you feel comfortable with power chords (that means you can finger them easily without thinking much about it and you can change from power chord to power chord without a hitch) you should try learning a song with them.<br><br>Here are a few songs that are extremely easy that involve power chords almost exclusively.<br><br>1. Territorial Pissings By Nirvana<br>2. Sliver By Nirvana<br>3. Down By 311 (Note:This is a little hard if you are just starting)<br>4. Brain Stew by Greenday<br>5. In Bloom by Nirvana<br>6. Polly by Nirvana<br><br>Try learning one or more of these.<br><br>After you have learned one of them, you want to try a song that switches between fingering single notes and power chords.<br><br>1. Dammit By Blink 182<br>2. Pathetic By Blink 182<br>3. When I Come Around By Greenday (This has an easy solo)<br>4. About a Girl By Nirvana (This has an easy solo)<br>5. I'm Broken By Pantera (This will help your soloing later)<br><br>These songs might take a little more practice, but once you can play them with few or no mistakes, you are on your way to becoming gig capable!<br><br>Once you'e learned a few songs and techniques, you'll want to take on a few solos and harder songs probably. You might have learned some really simple solos such as the ones in "When I Come around" and "About a Girl", but those don't improve your technique too much.<br><br>If you want to take on more difficult songs, you are going to have to do some more exercises first. Here are some more exercises that will help you develop the strength and coordination that is necessary for harder songs and solos. Note: these should be played with alternate picking.<br><br>Exercise One - Dexterity<br>|--10--------------9--------------|--9--------------9--------------|<br>|------11-------------11----------|-----10-------------10----------|<br>|----------12-------------12------|---------12-------------11------|<br>|--------------13-------------13--|-------------13-------------13--|<br>|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|<br>|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|<br><br>|--9--------------8--------------|--8-------------8-------------|<br>|-----10-------------10----------|-----9-------------9----------|<br>|---------11-------------11------|--------11------------10------| etc.<br>|-------------12-------------12--|------------12------------12--|<br>|--------------------------------|------------------------------|<br>|--------------------------------|------------------------------|<br><br>Exercise Two ?

            <div class='col-md body'>One of the biggest problems I had when starting guitar was figuring out what I should do with the thing. I didn'?have anyone to teach me. All I had was my guitar and amp. All I could think of to do was go to the Internet and search for something to learn. So I did, and I found this site. The only problem was there were so many tabs I didn't know what to do with them all. That's why I'm writing this article. The purpose of this article to give beginners advice on what songs they should try to learn first, and give them some exercises and advice so they can get on their way to becoming an excellent guitarist.<br><br>When I started playing I just got some tabs and started learning. In retrospect, I think it would have been better to develop my picking and fingering skills first, so I recommend that you start off by playing some simple scales and exercises so you get used to using those forgotten muscles in your fingers. Here are a few starting exercises to get started with.<br><br>|--------------------|--1-2-1------------|<br>|-----------------1--|2-------2-1-------|<br>|-------------1-2---|-------------2-1---|<br>|---------1-2-------|----------------etc|<br>|-----1-2-----------|--------------------|<br>|-1-2---------------|--------------------|<br><br>This is a simple exercise to help you get a feel for the neck and picking. You only use two fingers. Then use three fingers and play three notes per string, and when you are comfortable with that. Start using four, as shown below.<br><br>|--------------------------------------|----------5-6-7-8-9-8-7-6----------|<br>|--------------------------------------|5-6-7-8--------------------9-8-7-6-|<br>|-----------------------------5-6-7-8|---------------------------------------|<br>|-------------------5-6-7-8----------|---------------------------------------|<br>|----------5-6-7-8-------------------|---------------------------------------|<br>|-5-6-7-8----------------------------|---------------------------------------|<br><br>|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------<br>|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------<br>|9-8-7-6---------------------------|-----------------------------7-8-9-10-<br>|--------9-8-7-6-------------------|-------------------7-8-9-10-----------<br>|-----------------9-8-7-6----------|---------7-8-9-10---------------------<br>|--------------------------9-8-7-6|7-8-9-10------------------------------</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You should use that as a warm up before you play. And as that gets more and more comfortable, you can start doing your own variations on it. Like the one shown below.<br><br>|-------------------------------------|----------5-7-6-8--------------------|<br>|-------------------------------------|-5-7-6-8-----------5-7-6-8---------|<br>|----------------------------5-7-6-8-|-----------------------------5-7-6-8-|<br>|-------------------5-7-6-8----------|--------------------------------------|<br>|----------5-7-6-8-------------------|--------------------------------------|<br>|-5-7-6-8----------------------------|--------------------------------------|<br><br>Now you want to start with some simple power chords. They are tabbed below. For now you just want to get your fingers in place, and focus on changing from chord to chord quickly. You should pick up power chords fairly fast.<br>|---------------------|-------------------|<br>|---------------------|-------------------|<br>|---------------------|---2--------------|<br>|---2---3---5---7---|---2--------------|<br>|---2---3---5---7---|---0--------------|<br>|---0---1---3---5---|------------------|<br><br>Once you feel comfortable with power chords (that means you can finger them easily without thinking much about it and you can change from power chord to power chord without a hitch) you should try learning a song with them.<br><br>Here are a few songs that are extremely easy that involve power chords almost exclusively.<br><br>1. Territorial Pissings By Nirvana<br>2. Sliver By Nirvana<br>3. Down By 311 (Note:This is a little hard if you are just starting)<br>4. Brain Stew by Greenday<br>5. In Bloom by Nirvana<br>6. Polly by Nirvana<br><br>Try learning one or more of these.<br><br>After you have learned one of them, you want to try a song that switches between fingering single notes and power chords.<br><br>1. Dammit By Blink 182<br>2. Pathetic By Blink 182<br>3. When I Come Around By Greenday (This has an easy solo)<br>4. About a Girl By Nirvana (This has an easy solo)<br>5. I'm Broken By Pantera (This will help your soloing later)<br><br>These songs might take a little more practice, but once you can play them with few or no mistakes, you are on your way to becoming gig capable!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Once you'e learned a few songs and techniques, you'll want to take on a few solos and harder songs probably. You might have learned some really simple solos such as the ones in "When I Come around" and "About a Girl", but those don't improve your technique too much.<br><br>If you want to take on more difficult songs, you are going to have to do some more exercises first. Here are some more exercises that will help you develop the strength and coordination that is necessary for harder songs and solos.
