            <div class='col-md body'>Music downloaders beware: The heat is on in S'pore, too<br>As in US, industry here is gunning for those who flout copyright online By Natalie Soh , Straits Times<br>4 Aug 2003<br><br>MUSIC file-swoppers in Singapore, take note. You could get into trouble if you are downloading songs illegally.<br><br>The Recording Industry Association of Singapore (Rias), which protects the copyrights of artistes here, will be going after individuals for file-sharing violations, in much the same way as its American counterpart is taking action in a well-publicised campaign in America.<br><br>And the consequences could be severe. Technology lawyer Bryan Tan told The Straits Times that under the Singapore Copyright Law, a person caught distributing illegal MP3 files could be fined up to $100,000 and/or jailed for up to five years.<br><br>Rias has identified individual offenders, and has already taken legal action against some.<br><br>It has warned that file-swoppers cannot count on the anonymity of the Internet to hide their activities either.<br><br>Rias' chief executive officer Edward Neubronner told The Straits Times: 'Rias has taken action against persons who infringe copyright over the Internet, and will not hesitate to continue to do so.<br><br>'Those who think that the Internet offers anonymity so that they can get away with copyright infringement should think again.'<br><br>Illegal music downloads and file-sharing networks like Kazaa and Morpheus have been targeted by record companies recently in a high-profile drive.<br><br>The music industry blames online piracy for the fact that sales of CDs have dropped by a quarter since 1999.<br><br>To stop this slide, it is taking legal action against individuals who download and share music illegally.<br><br>More than 1,000 subpoenas, requiring Internet service providers to reveal the names of music swoppers, have been issued over the last four weeks.<br><br>And the scare tactics, though vilified by some, seem to be working. Traffic on Kazaa, the most popular song-sharing site, has dropped steadily since its peak in March of 17.4 million home users. This figure dropped to 14 million last month, a decline of 20 per cent.<br><br>Previous reports put the number of broadband subscribers here who regularly download music at 500,000.<br><br>Add the fact that almost all the music files found on the Internet are illegal copies, and the picture is of a large number of Singaporeans who breach intellectual property laws. But Rias is working to change that.<br><br>Mr Neubronner said it has identified people who are breaking the law, and last year, a university student was arrested for engaging in this form of piracy.<br><br>He declined to say what punishment was meted out to the student.<br><br>Several surfers The Straits Times spoke to expressed, variously, nonchalance and fear about the moves.<br><br>Mr H. Ang, 22, a student, said: 'All that's happening in America, no one cares about Singapore because we are so small. Don't worry.'<br><br>He says he downloads music because he does not like the idea of buying an entire album for just one good song - which he can get free.<br><br>But Mr Neubronner stresses that there can be no justification for theft.<br><br>'Consumers have a choice whether to buy a product or not. However if they choose not to for some reason or other, it's no excuse to steal it.'<br><br>The warnings will work with some, like Miss C. Chiang, 27, who works in an advertising consultancy.<br><br>She is more than rattled. When told of Rias' move, she deleted all 80 songs stored in her computer and has sworn off the practice.<br><br>'It's funny. When the industry was targeting the networks and stuff, it felt as if it didn't affect me.<br><br>'But now, when they say they are looking for individuals... it makes me think twice.'<br><br></div>
