            <div class='col-md body'>I was looking for a job via jobstreet and a agency named JAC PTE LTD replied.<br>They told me that a property company named  Tokio property PTE LTD was looking for property agent as they(Tokio)are impressed with my CV.But in my CV I did not say that I have any property experience. JAC told me that unlike other property agencies, Tokio was able to give a basic salary (2000-2500)  for the 1st 6 months for the training period after that is commission based. Sounds too good to be true rite, I went to check it up.<br>A Mr Tora XXXXXX was my interviewer, he told me that  actually they are looking for experienced agents with good sales record.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> Then why was I asked to come for the interview? Then ah, for the basic salary thing ( how much he never say) was only intended for those with dip or degree in property management whereas I only have a dip in Engineering. Then he said that Tokio property value their customers whom are japanese.<br>The commission is even more patheitc , you only get 25% , the company gets 50% as they provide you the leads and the advertisement, then that tora bugger gets 25% as you don't know japanese. WTF is this company!!!!!!<br>Anyone who is looking for jobs via jobstreet, must beware of JAC PTE LTD.<br>BTW JAC is liasing with japanese employers, so unless you know jap, you will lose out .Based on this encounter, I felt that jap looks down on asians who can't speak their language.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Most big companies offer a 70/30 commission scheme. Once you clock 20-25k , you will receive 80/20. Now you slowly work your way up until you achieve the max , which is 90/10. You can be an agent and recruit pple at the same time , dual - income in another words. Big companies offer free courses and are more beneficial to newbies.</div>
