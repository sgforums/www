Robert made his money from real estate. But what he teaches is leveraging and residual income. theory is that the magic of financial freedom is to do something which u need not be there but income will keep coming.<br><br>in real estate, u invest, sit and wait for price to go up as u do something else, then that is where your residual income is. it is only a tool. but how many ppl got money to invest in real estate or even got money savvy enuff to know that prices will go up and not down?<br><br>so in direct marketing such as the one we are discussing, u put up a webpage, u do something else, and if ppl buys something, u make money. at no cost. so what if it does not work? in real estate, if prices went down like now inrecession, then how? so that is also a tool.<br><br>so we are not discussing tools here. we are discussing how to make residual and permanent income.<br><br>btw, do you know that robert is now touring the world teaching that network marketing is the key to financial freedom? go to his website and get updated.<br><br>to belivers, robert is a guru. to non believers, he is a genius out to con ppl to buy his books. eitherway, that is leverage income. don't believe? then howcome he so rich?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> DuH<br><br>------------------<br>yeah yeah yeah, boogie woogie spit it out at <a href="http://www.my77thstreet.com" rel="nofollow">www.my77thstreet.com</a><br><br>Don't say I got lobang also never say!!<br><a href="http://www.sfimarketing.com/gateway/gateway.php3?163274695" rel="nofollow">http://www.sfimarketing.com/gateway/gateway.php3?163274695</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Usually when theres a scheme like this theres always a loophole, I've ever attended an Amway marketing seminar, these people asked you to join and then sell their stuff online and blah blah saying u can make up to 10k a mnth and all that while doing nothing but stay home and Kiao Kah.<br>I don't haf the time to go through wat ur website is proposing but I'm just warning u tat b4 u commit u should check out this kinda stuff first. Like the products sold, whos in charge, company background etc etc. Anyway after that seminar I really wanted to join but while doin some research on the net I found a site (forgot which one liao) which tore apart their theory and showed it wat happen step by step (even how the sales pitch goes), I have some frens that commited and now they're trying to pull out. (everynow and then they call to bug me).<br>Anyway I undestand how the money can be made and lost on the Estate and Exchange but High Risk = High Return.<br>I'm just giving u a precaution, dun be like so many others rushing for get rich schemes that fall apart cause along the way something cocks up, if you dun like wat I say then go ahead lar its not my $ it's Urs.<br><br>Btw are u working now or studying??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah yeah<br>i studyin'<br>and besides, i've read it carefully enuff and it seems to be fine to me<br>also, the site itself clearly states that it won't get us moolah overnite, and i already know wad to expect<br>thanks for your concern, but for me, i would suggest you go take a look at the site itself, because they are just 'selling' a CONCEPT, nothing more to u. don't always have to have a fixed idea on online networking just coz u took some seminar.<br><br>blurblop: yeah i conversing with them, i asking them wad is considered SPAM. coz i haven't accepted the non-spamming agreement yet as i dun really FULLY understand wad the agreement stipulates. have u accepted the agreement?<br><br>aniway, my team leader is elis wassel, see if u're in my powerline<br>and yes i got people from china, india, belgium yaddah yaddah joining, but not referred my me. most of tehm seem to be referred from a site called eagle leads or something</div>
