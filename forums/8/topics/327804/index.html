              <p>This school was located at tanjong pagar and later shifted to bugis. Now it is located near the bugis mrt station, just opposite the rocher centre.</p>
              <p>I have friends who worked there and studied there before. They say the school is a f**k up place. They employ those very lousy teachers who don't know how to teach and because the teachers are lousy so nobody want to go there to study. Thus, the school had to go to china and other countries to look for students. So currently the school do not have any singaporeans students, all their students are from overseas.</p>
              <p>Currently there are alot of foreign students studying in this school who regreted coming here to study but they have no choice but to complete their studies as they have already paid the school fee and no refund will be given to them if they stop their studies and they will be send back to their country.</p>
              <p>Please warn all your friends about this school espically if you have friends who are foreigners so that they will not get cheated by this school.</p>
