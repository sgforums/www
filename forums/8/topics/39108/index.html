            <div class='col-md body'>When it comes to turning a woman on, thereÂ’s wet, and then thereÂ’s wet. You can learn how to unleash a tidal wave of orgasmic juices in your bed. Read on to find out more about the phenomenon of female ejaculation.<br><br>How It Works:<br><br>Females ejaculate? Yes, they do. WeÂ’re talking about a gusher of fluid spurting out of her pussy as she comes. Actually, to be more accurate, the fluid comes squirting out of her urethra. DonÂ’t let this gross you out, though; itÂ’s not pee! Female cum is a clear, odorless liquid produced by a small organ called the Â“female prostate,Â” or urethral sponge, which is located between the urethra and vagina. The fluid it produces just happens to come out of the pee hole, but...so does guysÂ’ semen, right?<br><br>While some women may experience ejaculation naturally in the course of intercourse or other sex play, most require some concentrated stimulation of the G-spot. Massaging the G-spot causes the urethral sponge to become engorged with fluid, which is then expelled during orgasm. And, as with an orgasm, ejaculation also requires the woman to Â“let go.Â” Before ejaculating, the woman will feel as though she is going to pee. However, it is nearly impossible for her to urinate while coming, because the muscular contractions of orgasm close off the bladder and prevent the passage of urine.<br><br>Use Your Hands:<br><br>The most reliable way to induce female ejaculation is by manual stimulation. Lay a towel on the bed before you begin (the amount of fluid released can be considerable). Make sure your hands are clean and your nails well trimmed. Get into a comfortable position between her legs, as achieving ejaculation can take half an hour or more. Use lube if necessary to get started or in case she starts to feel dry.<br><br>Find the G-Spot:<br><br>Begin by stroking or licking her clit to get her aroused. Once she begins to get turned on, insert two fingers, palm side up, into her vagina. About an inch to two inches inside the vaginal entrance, you should feel a round, roughened area on the front wall. This is the G-spot. Stroke against this area using firm pressure. It should enlarge and begin to feel more solid. Try touching or licking her clit as you manipulate the G-spot. Follow her responses and pace yourself to prolong her period of arousal; the more time sheÂ’s aroused, the more juice is building up in there.<br><br>The Urge to Urinate:<br><br>As she gets closer to coming, she will start to feel as though she has to urinate. ThatÂ’s the cum beginning to flow into her urethra. In order for her ejaculate, she has to relax, let go, and push down and out with the same muscles she would use as if she were peeing. It may be hard to overcome the impulse to hold back, but you can reassure her, again, that if she is coming, she will not pee.<br><br>Instead, as she comes and pushes the fluid out, she should feel extra intense orgasmic pleasure, and you should be rewarded with a spurt of nectar that may range from gentle gush to a drenching spray.<br><br>Hints and Tips:<br><br>Attaining female ejaculation may take some practice and experimentation. You may find it easier to stimulate her G-spot if she gets on her hands and knees and you enter her from behind, pressing down on the G-spot instead of up. For more information and demonstrations, you can also check out Fanny FataleÂ’s video Â“How to Female Ejaculate,Â” which features women masturbating to ejaculation. As a woman gets more familiar with ejaculation and the sensations associated with it, it should be easier for her to achieve.<br></div>
