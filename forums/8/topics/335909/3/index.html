              <p>  <em><strong>Three
              Islamic militants condemned to death for the 2002 Bali bombings which
              killed 202 people have been executed by firing squad, their lawyers say.</strong><br><br> Imam Samudra, 38, Amrozi Nurhasyim, 47, and Ali Ghufron (Mukhlas), 48,
              died from shots to the heart on the island prison of Nusakambangan,
              local TV said. <br><br> They were found guilty of planning twin attacks on nightclubs at the resort of Kuta, popular with Western tourists.<br><br> There has been official confirmation of the executions. <br><br> The BBC's Lucy Williamson, reporting from close to the prison, says the
              three men were taken from their cells and driven to the execution site
              at midnight local time.<br><br> The execution took place in the darkness surrounded by forest and a handful of witnesses.<br><br> The deaths will not evoke much sympathy in Indonesia and many people
              believe the executions should have been carried out much sooner, our
              correspondent says. <br><br><strong>High alert</strong><br> Officials had said the three would be shot in early November but no date had been announced in advance.<br><br><br> Security forces have been on high alert across the country amid fears of reprisal attacks.<br><br> Members of radical groups have been gathering for days at the bombers' home villages to pay their respects. <br><br> A brother of two of the bombers is at the prison to help prepare the bodies before they are flown back to their home villages.<br><br> The dead men had apparently requested no autopsy and they had asked not
              to be buried in state shrouds, but in material brought specially from
              their family homes. <br><br> The bombings were blamed on the militant group Jemaah Islamiah, widely
              regarded as a regional affiliate of the al-Qaeda network. <br><br> Since they were sentenced the bombers made several appeals for leniency. <br><br> However, they also said they were keen to be "martyrs" for their dream of creating a South East Asian caliphate.<br> A last-minute appeal by relatives of the bombers was rejected by a Supreme Court judge earlier this week. </em></p>
