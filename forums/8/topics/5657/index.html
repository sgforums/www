            <div class='col-md body'>I was just wondering if there really is a need for couples to celebrate Valentines' Day at all...I mean, I know that it's supposed to be a day for the commemoration of your love for each other, but then again, isn't it awfully commercialised? (Then again, lots of holidays are nowadays) And if you get to thinking about it, if you know the history of St. Valentine, then it's not very accurate to say that V day is meant for couples to celebrate.<br><br>In my humble opinion, there is really no need for a couple to celebrate Feb 14th...after all, which couple can truly say that it is a special day FOR THEM? Why not have your own private special days? Isn't that more meaningful? I would think that only a very immature, unstable relationship would hinge itself on V day and the gifts that come along with it. Personally, I would be happier if my boyfriend didn't bow down to commercialisation and the lemming syndrome in giving me a gift. And if I know him the way I think I do, I know he won't. And our relationship is all the better for it.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Love &amp; poison,<br>Suede<br><br>[This message has been edited by Suede (edited 12 January 2000).]</div>

Sounds more like u trying to ruin other pple's relationships  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>&lt;1. cactus - nothing like a prickly plant to make your lover feel loved. besides, hundreds of smaller pricks make you less of a big one.&gt;<br>So you're gonna walk arnd with a sharp thing pointing at ur sides, preventing u guys to get real close?<br><br>&lt;2. a recipe book - preparation for next years valentine's. it'll be cheaper than going out too.&gt;<br>You want your gf to cook for you..? Shldn't she b enjoying herself on this special day?<br><br>&lt;3. mac's hello kitty doll - if getting beated up for a stupid ugly plastic cat doesn't prove your love for her, i don't know what will.&gt;<br>If she realli like the cat frm hell, u would haf already gotten it for her. If she hasn't got it yet, she juz plain hates it...no use wasting time, money, a meal, and bruises...<br><br>&lt;4. sexy underwear (keep the packet) - you can think of the model on the box when making love to your partner later in the evening.&gt;<br>You actually tink of someone else when ur making love to ur gf?! Anyway, this isn't for anybody...if you're not at that stage yet, you're probably gonna get a VERY tight slap  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>&lt;5. vacuum cleaner - a clean valentine is a healthy valentine.&gt;<br>More housework for the poor girl...and are u gonna lug dat thing arnd Orchard?<br><br>&lt;6. listerine - a minty valentine is a sexy valentine.&gt;<br>She probably gonna blow her top if dat's all u got her for Valentine's...<br><br>&lt;7. cheap wine - she looks better after the 5th glass. cheers!&gt;<br>This is a good one...rape her after she got drunk eh? I think not...<br><br>&lt;8. cassette recorder - to record the moanings later in the evening so you can listen to them whenever you want and have valentine's all year round. hooray!&gt;<br>She's probably gonna break off with you if this ever falls into the wrong hands...juz look at Andy Lau!<br><br>&lt;9. shower cap - if she has gone to the hairdressers that day to make herself look good for you, trust me, she'll appreciate it.&gt;<br>Another cheapskate gift...<br><br>&lt;10. a big fat slap across the face - to show her what kind of asshole you can be and thus make her appreciate you the rest of the year.&gt;<br>Looks like you're gonna break with your stead on Valentine's Day...</div>

Happy Valentines day !!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>But, baring that, I think that a nice, personally cooked meal (cake, steak, sandwich, etc etc.....) by you would be nice. Think about it..... he <strong>HAS</strong> to eat it with no complaints.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Then from there on, help yourself to a nice plate/bowl of whatever it is you cooked, and if its horrible, and he was a nice gentleman about it (you know, saying that its not bad, or quite good, when in reality, its erm.... unplatable...), then the both of you can go all lovey dovey. You can go... "You're so sweet dear.... *kiss* even though my cooking tastes horrible....."  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>If he was being realistic, and says it sucks..... well...... you can always punish him by making him eat the whole darn pot.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>And there are many myriad variations that can evolve from that step.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Its all up to you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br><blockquote>"A Gentleman is not an implement."<br>-Confucius, Analects, 2:12</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A great evening need not be too expensive or overhyped.Here are some ways I have tried b4 with sucess.<br><br>1) Go to the beach, with a bottle of champange and enjoy the brezze and the stars(wouldn't work if it is raining). If you are the romantic and adventurous type, get some diesel oil, and use it to draw your names on the sand of the beach. Lit it and let it burn with fiery splendour. (must use deisel oil, kerosene will not qork. Tried but fail the first time. ( But don't get caught for vandalism)<br><br>2) Spend the night together at her house or your house. watch both of your favourite, movies together and cuddle each other while whispering sweet nothings till you fall asleep. (most cheapo method so far.)<br><br>3) Go to the ngiht safari on Valentine's Day night. Suprise her with a deep kiss and present some flowers you make yourself when it is the darkest and nobody is watching. (But dun go ovewrboard or you might be caught for indecent behaviour in public)<br><br>4) Cook your own valentine's day dinner. (dun attempt if you do not know how to cook.<br>Make sure that there are potpurri scatter around the house and use dim lights for greater atmospher. (dun use just candles, it will melt before you get anything done, and it is really not that bright enough). Soft music, any music as long as it is what both of you enjoy, will have great effect.<br><br>Try them out.<br><br>For gifts,<br><br>How about some flowers you make yourself?<br><br>Some of you might think that it is too common, but YOu can make them look really professional if you know how. Put roses you made in a box filled with potpurri, even make the box yourself. You can add some chocolates inside the box to be more romantic.<br><br>Or if you know how, bake Choc Fudge yourself, wrap them up in nice wrappers and give it to her.<br><br>Does she drink? If she does, you can buy a bottle of Red wine or white wine and have it by the sea, while listening to sea waves.<br><br>Notice her missing anything nice in her bedroom? Or do you know something that she really like or look nice in her room? Well, hunt it down for her.<br><br>You can paint her room for her if you want to paint it her favourite colour and look at the surprise look on her face.<br><br>Tell her that you can't go out on Valentines day, but give her a flower each day and leave it at her doorstep dun leave a name but address it to her. Continue until Valentine's Day. Surprise her on that day by huggin her from behind when she picks up the flower on her doorstep, and whisper to her how much you love her.<br><br>Just some tips I have for you. Hope you find them useful.<br><br>------------------<br>Just my $0.02 Worth.</div>

Hope you dun go around and tell people to not to try it out, just because of a mitake you made on v day. No offence, but I think, going out with some other guys on v day when your bf is not free is perfectly all right but I think it would at least be polite to inform your bf about this. comments?
