This probably breeds a mindset whereby effort is more important than result, thus, it's better to stay and do OT than finish work early and go home.<br><br>Whereas in places, notably France, pushing for longer work hours will bring about violent protest and riots.

However, at what cost?<br><br>Working with a good proportion of ang mohs now, i've come to realize that they are often somehow very efficient. It was the reality of what i'd had been told in sg about 'working smart'. They are not efficient because of their superiors, but rather it seems to come naturally. they finish quick and have time to chill. and yes, they know very well how to play and have fun.<br><br>On the flip side, when i was in sg, 'efficiency' was about getting stressed up, being pushed by superiors, subtle threats of loss of free time, OT, bonuses. S'poreans had to be pushed and dragged. I know this is a generalization.<br><br>To summarize, it looks to me that ang mohs can get the job done efficiently in a non-stressful environment and yet be able to joke and have fun, while s'poreans have to slog and get worked up. Don't appear serious enough and you put your job in peril.<br></div>

But in our culture, firing is a sad and very emotional issue, it could even bring shame to a particular person been fired. Depress may even set in, people here dun take it as easy as they do. Of course both side have their pros and cons. But the concept is firing to Ang Mo mindset is a mere trading, just like i dun need your service anymore, so you take your pay and go, fair and square, thank you.</div>

Pain and not romantic at all. So guys, dun alway think that big is good ya. Normal is most preferred, but just dun be too small lah.<br><br>Ang mo is handsome only for a while, after that, they grow old very fast. And yes, most of them coming here are big bosses or talented expariates, but if you go USA or the west, you can see ang mo beggars seeking money from asian people, and many are mere workers living without saving. What we see here are the rich ones that are seconded to here. Why need their workers when we hv cheap bangala etc etc.<br><br>And also due to expose to much to movie and stars,  in a naive state of we young sg gals mind, we thot we see a resemble of Brad Pitt or Beckham etc etc. so in a hallucination mind, we thot we see our idol or God, but no, they are just the same as us, or maybe even worst. A lot of Ang mo got pyscho problem, you never knew till you get hooked by them ya.<br><br>Yesterday, my Dad watched soccer, he saw Thaksin in London as the boss of Manchester, this morning, he told us at bf, wha! now asian is the boss of a ang moh famous football club, the world have indeed changed.</div>
