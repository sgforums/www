He'll start off innocently though..instead of letting the issue die of he'll start a "Do you think Susan Chua is pretty or ugly.." thread. And then before you know it, he'll start asking for those who have slept with her..and then wham....!!! He'll start posting names, numbers and I see he also tried posting photos..<br><br>Just thought you should realise the kind of person he is. BTW he was kicked out of IR.. he had to change his nickname 3 times because he got banned by the administrators there and you may know that IR is very liberal.. for a forumer to be banned in IR, he must really deserve it..<br><br>Cheers and good luck in your forums..</div>
