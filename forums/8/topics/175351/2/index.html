            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, Klischia.<br><br>From what I know, most diet pills work on one or more of the following modus operandi :<br><br>- they act as detoxification agents, 'flushing' out 'impurites' (and also fluids) out of your body and since water weight is dense, you'll end up appearing to 'lose a lot of weight'; or<br><br>- they interfere with the body's metabolism, containing chemicals which increase your metabolic rate so that fat is burned at a faster rate; or<br><br>- they work like Xenical, the famous drug that basically ensures that any lipids are coated and then leaves the body without giving it a chance to be digested and eventually assimilated as body fat.  The notorious side effect of this is - fecal incontinence, which can be an extremely socially-crippling ailment and defeats the purpose of helping you slim down cause who wants to be near a slim, but fecal incontinent person, y'know?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>So, as you can see, all diet pills interfere with your natural body processes to a certain extent.  Different bodies will react different to the same pills and produce different results.  However, you should pay due consideration to the side effects that these pills may cause.<br><br>It isn't uncommon for the following side effects to occur :<br>dehydration, heart palpitations, nausea, giddiness, restlessness, etc.<br><br>Basically, whenever you pop a pill, you're introducing foreign substances into your body and depending on how efficient your liver is, it may or may not be able to metabolise these agents well.  Some of these agents end up causing damage to the liver or kidneys.<br><br>The big question is, is it worth it?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">   Would you want to be plump and healthy with rosy cheeks or slim but sickly and like the famous Lin Dai Yu of 'Dream of the Red Chambers' (Hong2 Long2 Mong4)?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Doctors always recommend diet and exercise.  A lifestyle change is usually what's needed.  Don't opt for the easy way out because you just never know what the consequences might be.<br><br>From my personal experience, whenever we get a young patient with abnormal liver function test results, I always hear the doctors asking amongst themselves, "Is this patient on diet pills?"<br><br>Now, isn't that telling?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
