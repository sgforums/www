That's the difference between a tomboy and butch.<br><br>My point is you cannot define male using both physical attributes AND mental attributes. The term "Male lesbian" implies 2 definitions.<br><br>From article: "does not have male recreational interests". How many people actually describe recreational interests as male? Its usually described as masculine. The author keeps switching definition. Usually, if people describe a sport as male, you will be labelled as a sexist because most people are still using the 1st definition.<br><br></div>

That's the difference between a tomboy and butch.<br><br>My point is you cannot define male using both physical attributes AND mental attributes. The term "Male lesbian" implies 2 definitions.<br><br>From article: "does not have male recreational interests". How many people actually describe recreational interests as male? Its usually described as masculine. The author keeps switching definition. Usually, if people describe a sport as male, you will be labelled as a sexist because most people are still using the 1st definition.<br><br></div></blockquote>hmmm. ok. lets change all definations from the usage of "male" to "masculine". it still makes sense does it not? and this was published in 1987, when sexism wasn't so widely condemned yet. so after making it politically correct, it still makes sense<br><br>and oh yes. i have a fren here who is quite tomboyish. she is a lesbian, but she is also not a butch. the thing is u can't just coin all tomboys as straight, and all the lesbian tomboys as butch. its incorrect. singapore society is too small to be able to have a more accurate view of social structure. here, I've seen many girls who can be described as tomboyish. they are also lesbians, and yet they aren't butch.<br><br>so this refutes your point that a tomboy must be straight and also refutes your point that we can't deinfe gender with both physical attributes AND mental attributes. we CAN and we MUST.</div>
