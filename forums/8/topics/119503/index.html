This is like common activity among the teen as if their bodies must be glued together and their hands touching all the privates and such.. but if they think its normal so be it. I am conservative and believe that its alright if a person were to s|ut themselves (its usually the girls who over kill on their wild actions) in private but to s|ut in public is just an eye sore. And if the teen think she's showing love... I look at the guy's face... I can tell the guys don't like it. Looking further, the aunties, uncles and ah pek, ah ma, disapprove. Some Chee Po Peh smirking  away.<br><br>But its my take crom outside of their relationship.</div>
