Because of this hurricane, the temperature of South-Eastern China including Hong Kong was raised.</div>

The evil doings of human and nature is paying it back to us.<br><br>Just read the news the isolated area with the most people trapped inside, which is around 200 thousand, had been linked to the main island with a temporary bridge. The bridge is just like a plank which worries lots about the dangers of crossing it as the wind is real strong.</div>

Typhoons are seasonal. This year we will have less according to forcast.<br><br>Earthquakes: We get them everyday. Most are too slight to report.<br>Taiwan sits on the intersection of three tectonic plates, and has dozens of active faults.We get shaken and stirred from time to time. If you are going to study in Taipei, not to worry as we here are protected by the Mountains around us.Taipei sits in a centre of a very large Valley.<br><br>The Last typhoon affected mostly the the Central and Southern areas and the mountain region badly. Taipei was okay. Lots of new systems have been put in place after Typhoon Nari.<br><br>You will enjoy yourself here. Good food,friendly people.lovely scenery There is always someplace new to visit here in Taiwan.</div>
