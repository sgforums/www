But unforunately, our society is obsessed with these qualifications. Most scholarship recepients will end up in government jobs till retirement cos they dare not venture out for fear of failure. There's a saying that the higher a person is educated the lesser risk he dares take. Juz take a look at those people in the top management of GLC. Many of them held several post in different companies. It's as if there is'nt anybody in singapore capable of filling them. Ridiculous!<br><br></div>

Why? Choosing a national leader is'nt the same as selecting a PSC scholars. Any students with straight A's and good ECA records can become a scholar, but they are'nt necessary a good leader.<br><br>Graduating from an ivy-league uni simply means you're good in your studies. To be a leader of the people, the candidate need to have intellect as well as charisma, personality etc... People who can fit into this category is definately lesser than the scholarship pool. What's more, they may not neessary come from it too.</div>

I teach tuition to earn my keep and take up odd jobs to ensure that I have money to buy my textbooks.

What for? In this posting, we are discussing whether it is essential for a PSC scholar to lead in the future...there was no presumption on our parts. As you will state later, most of the leaders will come out from the private sector anyway and I have stated that most scholars will start out at the stat boards and ministries after their education. Please correct me on this face if I am wrong.<br>[/b][/quote]<br><blockquote><strong><br>next. psc scholars are constantly scrutinised by the commission in watever we do. those who have strong ability are siphoned out and groomed to be administrative officers, the elite of the civil servants. even so, they  do not immediately make leaders, but rather become policy makers. the leaders of singapore emerge from the pack only after being tried for years. even so, many singaporean leaders come from the private sector, instead of coming thru this path.<br></strong></blockquote>I agree with your arguement here. But note again...it is one think to be able to formulate policies and another to implement them.<br><blockquote><strong><br>please draw the line between pap and psc. they are 2 separate entities. pls go and find out the difference if u do not know.<br></strong></blockquote>Nobody here said they were the same thing. One is a poltical party and the other is a stat board.<br><blockquote><strong><br>next, pls dont compare yr frens with "leadership ability" but poorer academic qualifications, with psc scholars. if they were so great,<br></strong></blockquote>Firstly, what makes you think that they have poorer academic qualifications? There are 7 intelligences that each individual possess and of which we have different measure of. A scholar could be academically inclined but another person could have a PHD in life. People like Wellington did not graduate with top honours in their academic life but they make great leaders in their own right. Academic excellence cannot be use as the only measure of a person's potential leadership role in the future.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>1. why dont they step out and contribute to the country? dont just talk.<br></strong></blockquote>At least they don't break bonds<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><blockquote><strong><br>2. if they are really so driven and have foresight why dont they strive to excel academically since they should know, as yet, this is one of the few ways companies (not just the public sector) compare candidates? perhaps they intend to start up their own businesses. if so, pls show the results before comparing.<br></strong></blockquote>Refer to my arguement above. Tan Lark Sai {my spelling could be wrong here} is not well educated but he is a good businessman. Success takes time to show...if I apply your argument, then why not PSC scholars strive out as entrepreneurs?

Each one will view themselves as a saint compared to the other. So lets do the best we live our lifes and let that be it.<br><br></div></blockquote>i just want to make my point tat psc scholars do not have things fall on their laps just because of the fact that we are scholars. behind each scholar is an individual who wasnt a scholar before. how would u feel if u were a scholar and u have people say things abt this identity of yours such tat it takes something like yr integrity and your ability from you? i always hear things being said about scholars "oh... they just know how to study, they wont survive in the business world etc". "come on, if they were so smart why dont they be entrepreneurs?" DUH, its hard to be a civil servant and an entrepreneur at the same time you know?"  and who said psc scholars will not succeed outside? as a matter of fact, the reason behind each scholar not seeking to strike out on his own is pretty much the same reason as to why university graduates dont do so. with our qualifications we can draw pretty comfortable pay and lead pretty comfortable lives without having to take the risk of investing our precious time and money into our own businesses. (as for me, if i do find someone i can trust to invest in a business i have confidence in, i dont mind chipping in as well.) having weighed the the pros and cons we both know tat if our businesses fail, we've got something to lose. we are in a different situation from those with lesser qualifications and who have, to be brutally honest, nothing to lose since they dont draw as well taking up a job. if i didnt have qualifications i would also set up business or sell something wouldnt i? and of course hope to make it big.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by greengoblin:</div><div class="quote_body">Jealous? What for? In this posting, we are discussing whether it is essential for a PSC scholar to lead in the future...there was no presumption on our parts.

Please correct me on this face if I am wrong.<br></div></blockquote>i said many, i didnt say most. yes of course most public service scholars will start out at ministries and stat boards. if not we would not be called public service commission scholars.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by greengoblin:</div><div class="quote_body">I agree with your arguement here.

What's more, they may not neessary come from it too.<br></div></blockquote>see? these pp AUTOMATICALLY relate scholars to leaders. who said scholars have to be leaders? who said scholars WANT to be leaders? wat ignorance. for those pp who think so here, pls go ahead and volunteer to be a young pap member or opposition member, watever. from wat i know the spore political scene is already lacking in youth leaders. i've got psc frens who prefer to take on professional roles in the civil service.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by greengoblin:</div><div class="quote_body">Firstly, what makes you think that they have poorer academic qualifications? There are 7 intelligences that each individual possess and of which we have different measure of. A scholar could be academically inclined but another person could have a PHD in life.
