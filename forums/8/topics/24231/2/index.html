Are'nt you too making an assumption too?

To be a leader of the people, the candidate need to have intellect as well as charisma, personality etc... People who can fit into this category is definately lesser than the scholarship pool. What's more, they may not neessary come from it too.<br><br>see? these pp AUTOMATICALLY relate scholars to leaders. who said scholars have to be leaders? who said scholars WANT to be leaders? wat ignorance. for those pp who think so here, pls go ahead and volunteer to be a young pap member or opposition member, watever. from wat i know the spore political scene is already lacking in youth leaders. i've got psc frens who prefer to take on professional roles in the civil service.</blockquote></strong><br><br>You seems to have read only part of my posting.
