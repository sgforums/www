            <div class='col-md body'>Thx, Joanne n FireIce for ur advices.  I remb i did asked him once who msg him when i saw her name thinking if there is nothing between them, he shld tell me frankly who is tat, but he kept aah and errm til i got angry, then he finally told me who the msg fr.  Actually if he's frank wif me tat time, i won't be angry wif him.  I dun like him to keep in touch wif her behind my back, I dun mind if i noe abt it but he always keep quiet abt it.  He erased her no fr his hp tat time but i saw her no. appearing in his hp under a guy's name recently.  He kept assuring me that there's nothing between them but y can't he be frank abt it?<br><br>FireIce, u mentioned tat u dun mind ur bf tokking or gg out wif his exs, does he always tell u frankly of all this?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm...mebe by not "reporting", he dun want u to think too much loh...<br>but i dun relli approve of the move about storing the lumber under a guy's name...perhaps relli hiding something....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>i would oso like my bf to be frank about it (if there is nothing to hide)...but if he dun want to tell me i oso dun ask lah...<br>i always believe in equality...if i tok/go out with my ex-bfs, i expect him to trust me, so vice versa loh<br>(ji suo bu yu, wu shi yu ren)<br><br>if he still like his ex-gf or 1-leg-step-2-boats then so be it....proves tt he is not worth a bf...faster settle and go separate ways better...<br><br>if u think a good talk with him over this matter (as well as laying down "terms") will at least ease urself then go ahead loh....<br>but i tink (judging by how he responded on u questioning abt the ex-gf's lumber)...he will most prob flare up and say u dun trust him and all tt...(i seen too many of such guys)...he might get irritated instead of solving this problem...<br><br>to him, he sees nothing wrong in still being frens with his ex-gf, tt u are juz being paranoid<br><br>to u, u are feeling insecure, and scared he might go back to  hi ex-gf if they keep in contact too much and rekindle old flame....<br><br>this is my analysis and my personal experience (not applicable to all)...<br>it's takes 2 to make a relationship...takes 3 to break a relationship...<br></div>
