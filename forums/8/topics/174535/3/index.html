The ppl and media in spore are making a big hoo hah even only a few ppl are rob compare to thousand of malaysians.<br><br>And sporean always says JB is most dangerous which is also wrong again. The remarks is based on bcos JB is most near and always expose to sporean and spore media who always and only report news about JB. Read the whole malaysian news and you will see places like KL, penang and other smaller town are even more deadly and much more news than JB.<br><br>btw... malaysia has over 20 million population.</div>
