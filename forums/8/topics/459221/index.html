              <p>Friends are people who support your life from the beginning and 
              through the end, non-judgmentally and with your best interests at heart.
               They're sounding boards, guides and shoulders to lean on. There are 
              times when, for one reason or other, we lack friends. For some people 
              this is a choice, and not a problem at all; many people, however, 
              struggle with this situation.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you've moved away from existing friends or perhaps there are 
              transitions within your usual group of friends that have left you on the
               outer. Sometimes our lifestyle loses us friends, such as when we marry,
               have children or focus intently on careers. Whatever the reason, living
               without friends can leave people who crave companionship feeling sad, 
              weary and quite alone. Learning to live through a period of life without
               friends requires trust in yourself, a willingness to keep reaching out 
              and a certainty that this is a phase in your life, and that some day 
              soon, the friends you desire will grace your doorstep again.</p>
              <p>Can people really cope without friends whether in school / work ?</p>

              <p>It depends on what we define as friends. If we define everybody in our facebook as our friends then we have a lot of friends. But ultimately these people in your facebook, are they going to visit you, if you are in hospital? Are they going to help you when you need their advice? They are more like acquaintances.</p>
              <p>If you up the definition and requirements, friends are people who are there for you, then you would probably have two or three close friends in your life.</p>
              <p>The thing, is we should not put so much expectation on a friend, after all, they will disappoint you. If your birthday comes, and your best friend forgets to text to wish you, you may get offended. Every one of us have our private lifes and friends do not have the obligation to care about you. Nobody is free to constantly keep in touch. Sometimes even close friends see each other like 3 times a year and this is for the working people.</p>
              <p>This is why I say, most important thing in our life is family. Family stick with us high or low. Not friends. Friends come and go. The friends that you were close to during school years, are not so close anymore, if you bump them in the streets, they likely say hi and bye to you. From school to work, your set of friends change. But family never change. This is why we should not try to be single, get married and have kids.</p>

              <p><br>May i see your Identity card, pls? I suspect you are having a panic disorder, anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, passive-aggressive behavior, sadism, a few emotional personality disorders (narcissism, histrionics, anti-social behavior). And some signs of <strong class="bbc">psychopathy</strong>.</p>
              <p>I would recommend you see a doctor for the sole purpose of having certain medications prescribed to you</p>
              <p>I am not sure if you are able to obtain medicinal marijuana, but it has been proven to help deal with erratic behavior. Again, ask your doctor, but I am 100% sure that whatever you have is not treatable, the best you can do is suppress it with medication so that it doesn't get too out of control.</p>
