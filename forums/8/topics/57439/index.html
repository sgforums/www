            <div class='col-md body'>&gt; MOST POWERFUL EMAIL I EVER GOT<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I had on new clothes,<br>&gt; New sneakers on my feet.<br>&gt; I was there for class on time,<br>&gt; Went to the back and took my seat.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Yeah, I'm moving up,<br>&gt; I'm already grown.<br>&gt; Soon I'll be graduating,<br>&gt; And out on my own.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I talked to some of my friends,<br>&gt; We were all having fun.<br>&gt; Said some things I shouldn't have said. Did stuff I shouldn't have done.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I knew I was different.<br>&gt; I felt God touch my heart,<br>&gt; I knew I should set a standard,<br>&gt; But then I'd be set apart.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Walking to the bus, I was not looking for strength.<br>&gt; I heard the car tires screeching,<br>&gt; But now it's too late.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I'm standing in this room,<br>&gt; And I can see the heavenly gate.<br>&gt; Oh no! I never prayed.<br>&gt; I thought I had time to get it straight!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; An angel walked to me,<br>&gt; He had a book in his hand.<br>&gt; I knew it was the Book of Life, When would this dream end?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I told him my name,<br>&gt; And he began to look.<br>&gt; Then he looked at me sadly and said,<br>&gt; "Your name is not in this book".<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Angel, this is a dream,<br>&gt; No, I can't be dead!"<br>&gt; He closed the book and turned away,<br>&gt; He whispered - "You cannot proceed ahead".<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "No...no this can't be real,<br>&gt; Angel, you can't turn me away.<br>&gt; Let me talk to God,<br>&gt; Maybe he'll let me stay".<br>&gt;<br>&gt; He led me to the gate,<br>&gt; Jesus came to me.<br>&gt; He did not let me in but said,<br>&gt; "Beloved what is your need?"<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Jesus", I cried, "please,<br>&gt; Don't cast me away from you".<br>&gt; Tears ran down his face as he said,<br>&gt; "You knew what you needed to do".<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Lord, please I'm young,<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I never thought I would die.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I thought I'd have plenty of time,<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Death caught me by surprise.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Lord, I went to church,<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Please Jesus, I believe.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;He said you would not accept me,<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;My love you would not receive.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Lord, there were too many<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;hypocrites. They weren't being true.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;He took a step back and asked,<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;What does that have to do with you?<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Lord, my family claimed to be<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;saved, They weren't real. You know.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;He said, I died for you,<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Now I have to go.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I fell to my knees crying to Him,<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Lord, I planned to be real tomorrow.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I couldn't make Him understand,<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I had never felt such sorrow.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Then it hit me hard, I said,<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Lord, where will I go?<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;He looked into my eyes<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;and said, My child you already<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;know.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Please Jesus, I begged,<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;The place is so hot.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;It seemed to trouble and grieve him,<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;He whispered, DEPART FROM ME,<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I KNOW YOU NOT.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Lord, you're supposed to be love,<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;How can you send me to<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;damnation?<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;He replied, With your mouth you said you loved me, But each day you<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;rejected<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;my salvation.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;With that in an instant,<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Day turned into night.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;MOST POWERFUL EMAIL I EVER GOT<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I never knew such torture could be, Now too late, I know the Bible<br>&gt; is<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;right.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;If I can tell you anything,<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Hell has no age.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;It is a place of torture,<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Separated from God and full of rage.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A little girl went to her bedroom and pulled a glass jelly jar from its<br>&gt; hiding place in the closet. She poured all the change out on the floor and<br>&gt; counted it carefully. Three times, even. The total had to be exactly<br>&gt; perfect. No chance here for mistakes.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Carefully placing the coins back in the jar and twisting on the cap, she<br>&gt; slipped out the back door and made her way 6 blocks to Rexall's Drug Store<br>&gt; with the big red Indian Chief sign above the door. She waited patiently<br>&gt; for the pharmacist to give her some attention but he was too busy at this<br>&gt; moment. Tess<br>&gt; twisted her feet to make a scuffing noise.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Nothing.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; She cleared her throat with the most disgusting sound<br>&gt; she could muster.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; No good.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Finally she took a quarter from her jar and banged it on the glass<br>&gt; counter. That did it!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "And what do you want?" the pharmacist asked in an annoyed tone of voice.<br>&gt; "I'm talking to my brother from Chicago whom I haven't seen in ages," he<br>&gt; said without waiting for a reply to his question.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Well, I want to talk to you about my brother," Tess answered back in the<br>&gt; same annoyed tone. "He's really, really sick... and I want to buy a<br>&gt; miracle."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "I beg your pardon?" said the pharmacist.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "His name is Andrew and he has something bad growing<br>&gt; inside his head and my Daddy says only a miracle can<br>&gt; save him now. So how much does a miracle cost?"<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "We don't sell miracles here, little girl. I'm sorry but I can't help<br>&gt; you," the pharmacist said, softening a little.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Listen, I have the money to pay for it. If it isn't enough, I will get<br>&gt; the rest. Just tell me how much it costs."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The pharmacist's brother was a well dressed man. He Stooped down and asked<br>&gt; the little girl, "What kind of a miracle does your brother need?"<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "I don't know," Tess replied with her eyes welling up. "I just know he's<br>&gt; really sick and Mommy says he needs an operation. But my Daddy can't pay<br>&gt; for it, so I want to use my money".<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "How much do you have?" asked the man from Chicago.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "One dollar and eleven cents," Tess answered barely audibly. "And it's all<br>&gt; the Money I have, but I can get some more if I need to.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Well, what a coincidence," smiled the man. "A dollar and eleven cents-the<br>&gt; exact price of a miracle for little brothers."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; He took her money in one hand and with the other hand, he grasped her<br>&gt; mitten and said "Take me to where you live. I want to see your brother and<br>&gt; meet your parents. Let's see if I have the kind of miracle you need."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; That well dressed man was Dr. Carlton Armstrong, a surgeon, specializing<br>&gt; in neuro-surgery. The operation was completed without charge and it wasn't<br>&gt; long until Andrew was home again and doing well. Mom and Dad were happily<br>&gt; talking about the chain of events that had led them to this place. "That<br>&gt; surgery," her Mom whispered. "was a real miracle. I wonder how much it<br>&gt; would have cost?"<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Tess smiled. She knew exactly how much a miracle cost... one dollar and<br>&gt; eleven cents ...... plus the faith of a little child.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; A miracle is not the suspension of natural law, but the operation of a<br>&gt; higher law...... (A TRUE STORY)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Everyday when you return from your school, whether or not it is from a secondary school, a junior collage, a polytechnic, or ITE, you would probably think that school sucks.<br><br>All that work and torture under your lecturer's or teacher's homework or assignments, or tutorials...<br><br>But think about this, i mean really think. All the time spent with your classmates, all the laughter, sorrows, and happiness of knowing that your friends are there in your class.<br><br>Now imagine them gone, perhaps part of them or even all of them.<br><br>You may not realise it, but when advancing into the next level of education, it is inevitable that some friends will be parting with you.<br><br>What is all this you ask yourself, what I ask is of you to think, for those who received this mail, what do those people who were once or were still your classmates and friends meant to you.<br><br>Anyone who has at least finished their o levels and has graduated from respective schools would know the feeling of parting with your classmates and friends.<br><br>Not knowing when you still see them again.<br>Perhaps the next day, the next week, month, years, or even decade.<br><br>Perhaps one day, you would realised how bitter sweet those memories were, the fun you had with your classmates and friends.<br><br>That is why ever so often when you asked someone which is the most fond memories they had in their years in education, they would often have that sadness in their eyes, but yet, they smile briefly.<br><br>It's the memories of their school friends. Those unforgettable years of laughter and happiness in school.<br><br>Each classmate had suffered under the same stresses in school. The teachers, whether they are kind or extremely strict.<br><br>So treasure your schooling days, don't complain, because you never know when you will miss them dearly. And perhaps, shed a tear for those treasured times in your youth.<br><br>~~If this touches your heart, and reminded you of those classmates who brought happiness, laughter, colour to your life, you can pass it on, let your classmates know that although all these years, whether short or long, you still have not forgotten them.~<br><br>~Let those whom are weak and tormented in the spirit find strength in this letter, knowing that someone still remembers them, and care for them.
