              i noe of a few cases where the gal meted out harsh punishments of some sort...below is one of them...
              
              guy was found unfaithful by one of the gal's frends...gal interrogated the guy n found out he had indeed an extra affair outside...infuriated, she insisted on a breakup at once...apparently the guy was unwilling, he begged for another chance...after a while, the gal agreed to give him one last chance...she told him to go to her place the next day...
              
              when the guy went to the gal's place the next day, he was in for a rude shock! the gal ordered him to take off his shirt, kneel outside her door n slap himself hard until she was satisfied...she left her main door open n told him to make sure his slaps were hard enuff for her to hear from inside the house...
              
              it was a horrid time for the guy...from wad i noe, the gal kept him there for abt an hr! by then, it had alredi created a scene as passer-bys n neighbours had seen the guy being punished n some were giggling at him...the guy sure had a horrid time as the gal would come up to him each time she realised tat he was nt kneeling properly/nt slapping hard enuff n demanded he knelt properly n slap himself hard...from wad i noe, the slaps demanded were rather hard n the gal expected every slap to be of the same intensity...
              
              the guy was forgiven after tat but he suffered swollen cheeks n bruised knees n sure did learn his lesson after tat...

              <p>Anyway, you need negative to neutralise a positive, so got some negative also good, if you think everything is positive, you will be asking for trouble, cos not all things are positive, what i feel is that everyone of us have to be realistic about life, if you take on love, be prepare to hold responsible and absorb the negative impact of love. Otherwise, you dun fit to be in love or even talk about it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Love cut like both side of a knife, it can be so wonderful and it can be so fatal.</p>

              <p>It's no wonder that he had an affair outside, with a girlfriend who would do such insane things, though he's probably nowhere  better in terms of sanity to obey her like a poodle.</p>
              <p>Anyway, to your question, I think the classic punishment would be the <a href="/forums/2223/topics/320202">set-garage-on-fire</a> method.</p>

              hey i juz heard abt a case when the guy was punished in a very shameful manner by his gf...apparently, his infidelity was found out by the gal n there was a cold war for abt 2 wks...the guy then begged the gal to forgive him, agreeing to allow the gal to mete out any form of punishment she wished...
              from wad i noe, the gal finally agreed to the guy's plea n deliberately planned a social gathering involving her frends n classmates...she invited the guy to the party as well...
              
              at the party, the gal took the guy to her room n asked if his promise to receive any form of punishment from her was stil valid...the guy said yes nt noeing wad was in store...the gal then opened her wardrobe n took out one of her evening gowns which she wore for her prom nite...she gave it to the guy n ordered him to put it on...next she made him sit at her dressing table n she began to put make up on his face...when it was finally done, she told him tat as a punishment, he will remain tat way until the party ended...
              
              the guy pleaded for leniency of cuz but the gal gave him onli 2 options: either be dressed up like a gal for the party or she put an end to their r/s once n for all...in the end the guy gave in...
              
              u can imagine the embarrassment he suffered when he showed himself at the party...all eyes were on him, many giggled at him...there were of cuz many who knew he was being punished for his unfaithfulness...the gal kept gd her word...she made sure the guy remained dressed like a gal until the party ended...the guy was so terribly embarrassed...
              
              well, the gal forgave him in the end but the guy sure learnt his lesson n became a 'gd boy' after tat...

              <p>Anyway, you need negative to neutralise a positive, so got some
              negative also good, if you think everything is positive, you will
              be asking for trouble, cos not all things are positive, what i feel
              is that everyone of us have to be realistic about life, if you take
              on love, be prepare to hold responsible and absorb the negative
              impact of love. Otherwise, you dun fit to be in love or even talk
              about it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Love cut like both side of a knife, it can be so wonderful and
              it can be so fatal.</p>
