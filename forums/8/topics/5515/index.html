It'll be a refreshing change for most guys and at least they can assess how they feel about the girl before actually carrying on.<br><br>Personally, my first reaction would be surprise and shock that the girl actually likes me. I've been through 23 years of life never expecting females to tell me they like me, or even hinting it. I was a pretty low-profile person back in JC and was considered "dao" and maybe even nerdy ?? Haha.....at that time I wasn't feeling too confident about myself and it's been a struggle to build up some self-esteem. So far it's been an uphill climb  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I would welcome a girl to make moves or show that she is interested. Yet, I still want to do the chasing and asking. Yes don't get me wrong, I've since "improved" since my JC days and I still desire to really "chase" a girl. It would be best if she hinted that she liked me without being too forward about it, and leave the rest to me to react. If I don't react, it's a simple sign that I am not interested in her.<br><br>If a girl is very aggressive in chasing a guy, I think it might scare him off, especially the more shy/guai/decent ones...because probably such guys are unused to the attention from girls. Handsome/rich/smart guys should be more used to girls chasing them because of what they can offer - Pecuniary Benefits ! For guys like me and a few others I know, it would be a pleasant surprise and I would really enjoy it very much too.<br><br>Actually, an irc friend that I chat with did tell me she likes me (though not directly but over icq) and we have been talking over the phone for about a month.

            <div class='col-md body'>Great Topic!!!<br><br>Very busy and need to sleep for tomorrow, but would like to post first.<br><br>It would be great to have girls finally chasing after the guys, but then again, the ones that do chase guys are the kind who would usually approach or initiate with a guy  who's quite attractive physically, so that leaves a lot of guys wishing again...:-)<br><br>Like Whiz said, it doesn't really happen to most of us ubnless we got something physivcal to offer them.  Sometimes it happens tho...sometimes...but not often.:-)<br><br>Has nyone ever initiated with me?  Nope....maybe a couple times...once, like whiz, was on ICQ. Just recently actually.  I only had gotten to know her and we connected on the ICQ and she was asking me to cheat on my GF to do whatever...u get the point.  I guess that's initiating, but I declined...like an idiot or a real man...depending on wich girl or guy u ask.  :-)  She was quite attractive tho.<br><br>The major one was when I was studying here at this international school behind Wisma...Overseas Family School.  These two girls told my sister that they wanted to screw the shit out of me...Naturally my sister came and told me about it.  Man was I stunned.  I was in cloud nine.  Where got any girls ever say that to me before?  I was 18 or 19 at the time.<br><br>The next day, they (from same class as me) asked me, "Hey, did ur sister tell u that we wanted to sleep with u?"<br>(the 2 girls were good friends...I guess they like to share:-)<br><br>When I told them yes...I was stammering,...they told me that they didn't mind that I knew and wouldn't mind at all if I just wanted to just have a fling with them.  man i was a nervous wreck.  I almost popped in my grey uniform right then and there.!!!<br><br>For the rest of the semester, they kept calling me and asking me over to their house, saying that their parents went on a business trip and stuff..."...just to watch TV..."<br><br>Yeah right.<br><br>I never went or did anything because I was a green horn.  Never even seen a woman naked except on TV and porn mags.  Still virgin.  For a guy, I guess I "graduated" quite late...But, again, I was either a real man for declining, or I was a real dork....for this instance, I was a dork because I wanted to but too scared....God, u should hear about my first time...it's so funny...:-)<br><br>In fact, I think I'll post about it before I go to sleep.  Hope I don't offend anyone...It's more like a manual for what not to do.<br><br>Happy getting hunted folks, and good luck with the ICQ girl whiz.  U guys haven't met each other yet?  Or yes?<br><br>in any event, I think u got it already, so luck really isn't necessary.  cool.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi to all and a very good day !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Ok so here's my little story about the irc/icq thingy...not as exciting as firewire's story but nevertheless, it means a lot to me personally.<br><br>As said earlier, it was a sort of meet the girl over irc, find out we can get along and then exchange phone numbers kind of situation. Of course, she gave me her pager first (Let's call her X), and after the first chat over the phone she trusted to give me her home number.<br><br>I won't give details about this girl, such as where she is studying, how she looks etc...because I don't want to identify anyone and most importantly, I respect privacy.<br><br>The first time we spoke over the phone, it's like some kind of strange connection. The conversation just flowed about all sorts of topics...ranging from BGR to life to studies. It was amazing how someone else could talk so much and be so interesting and witty at the same time. Personally, the girls I hang out with in my own University are rather "slow", less exciting in the way they express themselves. (This is NOT a criticism but merely stating an opinion - they are still great to be with, but will never be my gf)...anyway....<br><br>We called each other more after that and basically we really enjoyed talking to each other and we could tell each other about our own lives and share points of view. We even sort of shared the same quirky sense of humour (which for me is really hard to find...most girls just find me WEIRD !)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>The problem was: we were of different races. Suffice to say that I am chinese and she wasn't (not Caucasian in case anyone suspects)...and when my parents found out the y weren't too happy.<br><br>At this point, some of you may think that my parents are being unreasonable and restricting my freedom. Actually, the reasons they cited are practical and not directed at her personally...they told me that inter-racial relationships were problematic. I had confessed to liking her becos of our conversations.<br><br>I then broke the news to her over icq....and she dropped the BIG bomb by saying that she liked me and why did I have to do this ? Frankly, I couldn't really believe it and had the nerve to ask her to repeat herself ! Hahaha...<br><br>But the news slowly settled and sunk in, and I was faced with the prospect of a girl liking me for who I am (we had not met yet) and telling me I was the first guy she really liked. Quite hard to swallow believe me.....especially when I have lived half my life under a shelter. I told her that I liked her too but that we were of different races and could not be together. Her friend later said that she was very cut up over the whole incident and could not study properly, which made me feel even more guilty...<br><br>I called her up and she was crying over the phone but I managed to cheer her up and we started talking about the 2 of us, for real. She was the one who told me to take a chance...to allow racial differences to step aside, and to accept her a gf. Man ! I was confused and very very troubled. I mean...you watch this kind of thing on TV but never expect it to happen to you ! Problem was I also liked her and how comfortable I felt talking to her.<br><br>My mind was made up though and I told her to just remain as friends. This initally caused some friction but later we cleared it up. So far we have been calling each other now and then (less often) and just talking, but the issue sometimes still arises and makes both of us uneasy. By the way we have met and sort of accepted each others' looks (anyway that's not the issue here).....<br><br>So that's why I am still a swinging single ! Hahahah....ok folks, now your turn to comment...was I being a real BIG idiot or are there people who think I made a sensible choice ??<br><br>My reasoning was that I didn't want to lead her on...like some guys love to do....and then later claim racial differences and dump her. She is emotional and may never get over the hurt.<br><br>I guess that's all for now...haha my little tale of a pseudo-relationship  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Cheers everyone !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Honestly I think it'll be great for the girls to make the first move, takes the pressure of inexperienced guys like me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>And as for musicwhiz, I think you missed out on what might be a wonderful relationship man! For one, although interracial relationships might be quite taboo in the past, I feel that such kind of relationships are on the rise.<br><br>Our society is opening up, no to mention the "faceless" encounters on the Internet, which allows you to know a person better even though you wouldn't know what he/she looks like. Basically, you are getting to know a person, despite the fact whether they are Chinese, Malay, Tamil, etc. But for one thing, I feel it is still a pretty touchy topic, I for one have asked myself if I would be able to accept a gf who was of a different race from me.<br><br>The answer? Well I couldn't answer myself. There's always still this little bit of apprehension. No point being self-righteous and saying, "Ya, I would go for it!" and when you are actually faced with a real prospect, back down and feel like shit inside because you have just turned your own words.<br><br>On another note, that's the great thing about IRCing isn't it? You get to attract people through your personality and character and your looks are secondary(till the point you meet) Still, I think musicwhiz, you have missed out on a great oppoturnity.... Juz dun miss out on a second time!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Why? Why me?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, ata, I guess I would really like girls to hint strongly that she likes a guy, and then leave the chasing to the guy, whether he will or not is another matter altogether. But that is only my preference, if a girl is to chase a guy strongly, I have no objections to that.<br><br>And Musicwhiz? I would just like to say that one of my mom's friends, a Malay lady, was going out with this Chinese guy, also a friend of my mom. They were happy together, but due to parental and family pressure, the relationship managed to last for about 2 years. When they broke up, the friendship was strained, and they seldom talked to each other even when my mom organized gatherings at our place. That went on for another 2 years plus, but now they're again on talking terms. I don't really object to interracial relationships( one Chinese lady got married to an Indian guy, now living happily with two hyperactive kids...), but your family and her family have to be comfortable with one another. Marriage isn't just between 2 people lor...parental objection can really break up a relationship...<br><br>If you think you can handle it nice and good, then I'd say go ahead and be happy, both you and her. All the best!!!<br><br>Cheers...<br><br>[This message has been edited by demonsbane (edited 01 November 1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I actually was gonna do my work, have to go to the printers and print my designs....by today!!!!....<br><br>...but I just had to respond to ur post Whiz,<br><br>Ur posting was very romantic.  It really is. (Not some smut like mine..ha ha ).  I'm sure a lot of girls would love to read this article...u know how they love to read and watch such things...ha ha(just generalising to get a response from females out there)...<br><br>It really sounds like a fairy tale case.  Beautiful.  I know how u feel about just somehow hitting it off instantly and somehow it feels like u know each other so well.:-)<br><br>I must agree with Demon and Eck though...Maybe u should take a look again at this relationship.  Maybe it will end later, maybe it won't...who knows.  We can never wait around for that right one to come along...We must be wise enough to know that sometimes, even against logic, we must take that chance.  It might be a step towards something extremely meaningful in ur life.  Even if it doesn't last, that knowledge/experience will glow inside of u for as long as u live.  Even if u break off screaming and shouting at each other, it will never change that feeling that u were willing to experience with this person.  It could and will be beautiful...no matter what happens.<br><br>My present GF's parents don'ty like me.  when I first met them, they thought I was really nice, but when they started suspecting that I was going out with their daughter, they objected to her and told her she shouldn't see me because I'm not Singaporean, not chinese(I'm asian I look Jap, or chinese, or Indoesian..international asian look.:-)...what's the diff?).  It's all logical why she shouldn't go out with me, but our relationship works what...Loves me, Love her...and we get along.  2 years now and everything is fine even tho we are worlds apart.  Believe me, we are very different people.  It's that she's a good person and she likes me and vice versa.  Till this day, they still object, but she has kept it secret from them for a long time now because she knows they will make life for her harder...they did when they first suspected...Cut her allowance, silent treatment,..etc...<br><br>The point is that, in love...a lot of times, u must not let the logic of it take presidence over what is most inmportant..ur feelings for each other.  And even if u break up, who's to say that u can never be friends with her again?  I totally disagree that x couples cannot be friends.  Yes, usually it is difficult and painful at first, but when u get over that eventually, and u will, u will have them back as a good friend again.  And ur relationship with them moves on to a new level.  All my x GF's are on very good rterms with me even tho they have done many things to hurt me befoe our break-up.  I realised that it is best in the long run to remain friends...Till this day, they still contact me to wish me happy B-day or x-mas or whatever and we still talk when we have the time....and it leaves a sense of calm inside ur soul knowing that the person on the other line was someone that u once shared something so sacred with...there's still this unspoken knowledge, on both sides, that u miss the way u used to feel about each other and how wonderful it was...and ultimatelt, it makes u happy to have that assurance with u even in the coldest, most lonely, darkest of nights...<br><br>So give it a consideration...throw caution to the wind...believe me, most people go thru their whole lives never experiencing what u have experienced...They go thru their whole lives searching for this "moment", that "instant", when ur heart races and ur mind reels in disbelief that "this is really happening to me..."<br><br>Believe me, it may only happen once, and often times, never to thos unlucky many. Embrace it and it shall make u whole.<br><br>Good luck...mainly for being able to live thru my pantented firwire posting...:-)ha ha...All the best man.</div>

Should you miss the chance, you will probably regret for the rest of your life.

Bet some of us here have got 'misses' and are still reeling from the hurt of it. My advice or rather opinion is that, make the first move irregardless of gender.<br><br>-----^0^-----</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ataraxia :<br><br>What you described is fine. Taking the initiative to tok to the guy you like is great and much lacking in girls these days, and calling him is great too cuz it's a very good sign to him that there is a chance for him (if he likes you too). But as with everything else, there must be moderation. Calling all the time or calling even when the result is a mediocre unsubstantial conversation makes the guy feel like a 1900 number.Make sure when you call him, both of you actually have an enjoyable conversation, this means you have to learn to listen to him and feel if he's as interested in the telephone conversation as you. And make sure he has your tel no. and WAIT for him to call you after your first few calls before you continue to plague him with more calls. And DON"T ask him or hint to him to call you, to me it's a very big turn off, cuz when I call the girl back I want to feel that I"m doing it cuz I want to not cuz she wants me to.<br><br>And about toking to the guy in person, don't overdo it either, don't come across as an airhead or overemotional about everything. I find girls who are super hyper when talking or tok without much substance, just a damn lot of it more amusing than anything else.<br><br>As for the thrill of the chase I admit there is quite a bit of it involved but I personally feel that if you like this guy and let him know that. And he gets turned off NOT becuz he doesn't like you but cuz the thrill of the chase isn't there anymore, then I think that's not a very potential meaningful relationship is it? If he knows you like him and he likes you even when there's no chase needed for him, it shows that love isn't just a hunting game to him and he really values you.<br><br>a last point, if some girl who's like jennifer lopez or something came on super strong and all, pestering a guy, even if there is zilch thrill of the chase involved I'm very sure NO guy will reject her. Kinda puts things in perspective doesn't it?</div>

"i just got hme now... what are you doing? pg me when you get hme.." then "hi..just got hme also.. gonna do my hw/watch tv/walk the dog/bathe/sleep... you?" and this goes on forever till i can finally call him. dumb? yes. corny? definitely. but it's really sweet when you're getting and giving such corny pgs.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>also, i nv give guys my no.

            <div class='col-md body'>Ataraxia, your post kinda reminded me of my first gf who initiated the first move when I was in JC.....even though she would insist that I did. I had kinda given up looking for that special someone, and decided to dedicate my life to sports and a life in the monastery, after having been told oh-so-many-times by girls that they just treat me as their 'brother' or some nice guy that they could confide their thoughts in but nothing more.<br><br>Then one day, I noticed this attractive girl (whom I had seen around in school but never had the guts to approach because of my numerous setbacks) attending all my practices and matches. She would be really chatty when she was around me and showed 'real' interest in the game I played. She would also wait for me to finish washing up in the locker room after my pratices, just so that we could walk to the bus-stop together. However, given my low self-esteem back then (when it came to girls that is), I just boiled it down to the fact that either she was really interested in the game of rugby (not!) or it was just a ploy to get to know one of my team-mates, and I must say alot of them could have easily won the school's popularity contest hands-down then.<br><br>It wasn't till one of my friends had to spell it all out to me that I finally realised that she was interested in me...yes ...me! So I finally I asked her out and the rest was history, well almost, until the army came along and we drifted apart.<br><br>Sorry for the grandmother's story guys, but the point I am trying to make is if she hadn't showed me those indications I would never have asked her out, let alone had a relationship with her.<br><br>Did I think that she was cheap or desperate? Of course not, in fact, I had kinda admired her for it as I realised that it took quite alot of courage to do what she did and I was really thanking my lucky stars that she made the "first move". Like the Latin poet who coined the phrase "Carpe Diem" (seize the day), life is really too short to wonder if it could have been. If you really like someone, just go for it...who knows he might just be thinking the same thoughts as well, just that he is probably just as gutless as I was.<br><br>So who knows? Ataraxia, you might just be doing the guy one big favour  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">.<br><br>And guys, if a girl that you are not interested in approaches you, let her down gently will you and appreciate the fact that it probably took her a lot of guts to do it.<br><br>Cheers!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ataraxia,<br><br>Yeah the paging thing is def effective, it does make you feel closer to a person easily with nice sweet msgs like "Make sure you drink lots of water, you'll get better faster." or to actually bother to rem and page "sweet dreams" every nite. But sometimes people get carried away and it's easy to punch in a msg on the phone just to be nice and not sincerely mean it. I admit I was guilty of it before, so be careful in interpreting the feelings behind pages.<br><br>And as for the airhead stuff, no I"m not degrading you indirectly or something.. I"m doing it DIRECTLY... hahhahha just kidding, couldn't resist that. BTW how the heck do you put in the smiley face symbol thingy? Ok on to the airhead thing, I think the nicest situation I've been in was when I was toking to this girl and somehow both of us started getting super silly and all, spouting absolute rubbish that totally reduced us to hysterical laughter, you know deep inside that both of you are totally crapping around and chickens prob have more sensible converstions but the wonderful thing is both of you understand each other's rubbish enuff to connect on your own special wavelength.
