            <div class='col-md body'>If u'd guys ask for a choice of cinemas wif good sound quality, I'd say Orchard Cineplex and Shaw House - Lido. However, it's quite difficult to get good seats for good movies there as it's always full house.<br><br>Talking abt comfy, nothing sure beats the cinema at Suntec. There won't be as much people there especially on midnite shows. Imagine the ROW infront of u is empty and u can put yur legs up!! WooooHooooo....<br><br>However, I wouldn't be so Xiao to go to Suntec juz to catch a midnite show. Probably somewhere nearly...

            <div class='col-md body'>Long list here...<br><br>Lido 1 has been the most consistently satisfying for me, by far. Good THX-certified sound, played at just the right volume and level of intensity. I'll never forget watching Face/Off and Saving Private Ryan there, hearing the bullets zip all around me. Lido 2 is marred, aside from the inferior sound, by a lighting problem which shows up on the right side of the screen. The smaller halls are best avoided.<br><br>Among GV cinemas, Plaza seems generally ok. Some GV cinemas have deteriorated though, eg. Tampines, Marina, Tiong Bahru. The sound quality used to be much better just a couple of years ago. Now they have all sorts of problems. Something tells me they're skimping on regular maintenance and tweaking. In addition, the standard tiny seats in most GV halls are pretty uncomfortable for me - it slopes downward at the neck region, forcing my head down, but the screen is high up. I'm glad Plaza has better seats. And finally, trying to watch a movie in one of Marina's THX-certified halls is pretty much like playing roulette - you never know which movie they've assigned to those halls.<br><br>At Cineleisure Orchard, I've had the disconcerting experience of watching colour tones change in mid-movie. This happened on several occasions. Projection is frequently below par, with regular alignment and brightness problems. Sound is sometimes slightly too loud and flat, lacking the deep cinematic feel. Got a headache watching Armageddon, which was incidentally a putrid movie.<br><br>Suntec audio screeches at brain-boiling volumes. I avoid that cineplex at all costs.<br><br>Bugis' "tombstone" seats are some of the most uncomfortable ever designed. The screen is also awkwardly high. Sound is superior with a good enveloping effect which is missing in most cinemas. Another cinema which boasts a good discrete sound system is, to my everlasting surprise, Picturehouse. Don't watch a movie at Picturehouse when it's raining heavily, though. You might end up hearing soft waves of pitter-patter somewhere high above you.<br><br>Century seats are large and plush, nice to sink into, but they don't make up for the hollow sound quality and even more hollow walls - better pray the movie showing next door isn't full of noisy explosions.<br><br>gintonic, I don't recall Bugis being THX-certified?</div>
