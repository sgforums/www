Would you feel like you are so weak, and need a girl to drive you around??<br><br>How about the opinion of gals??<br><br>For me, I would feel awkward about having a girl driving me around.. perhaps it's a ego thingy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My friend and her bf both have a license. The girl has her own car but the guy only has access to the family car. So she drives them around. The guy was happy with the situation but she wasn't. She didn't, and still doesn't like driving becos its' stressful. They argued about this for a VERY long time. Now, she picks him up and he drives her car from there.<br><br>My bf drives me around everywhere. Now he's hinting that I should get a license. He likes to drive most of the time but sometimes, he would prefer me to do it becos he has a headache (overworked). I dun mind but I'm too busy at the moment.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, guys who dunno how to drive is NOT useless, but a guy with a license and drives terribly (not including his 'off-days')IS useless.<br><br>Looking at how most female drives makes me think twice about being on her tail. Especially if u're in a traffic hold up or u're in this lane that's really empty of traffic. They would go way too slow. Sigh...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>What's worse is that u meet those Ah Lians who just got P-plates and driving those Beng-type Honda VTI at traffic junctions. They'd try to race u. I've met several Ah Lians and Bengs trying to race me (I am driving a BMW 718i) at traffic junctions. Probably it's my car, I don't know. But all I know is that I can never see their car once I've floored the accelerator. This can be true especially if I meet Lians.<br><br>------------------<br>Your eyes can deceive you, don't trust 'em. - Obi-Wan Kenobi</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah... jeff is totally right... those P-plates trying to show off their cars and driving skills. My friend just got herself in huge trouble by "showing off" her skills. haha.. she had to go court for speeding 58kmh over limit.<br><br>and jeff, it's your car. not that they are slow. If you are driving a 318i (i think around 140 bhp), it's nothing to be compared to Honda VTi's 110 or so Hp). I dunno what car you are really driving. if it is a 728i... well, i think it would be at least 200 hp. WHERE would a Honda stand?<br><br>I wun be accurate with the horsepowers because i am not sure if Singapore models are same as those in N. America. and N. America dun have 728 and 318 (saloon). Too "small" for the market. hmm dunno if they are coming to Singapore, but the BMW M5 is surely something to die for, imagine 400 horses. I dun think the police can ever catch you with such a car. but of course, you must have the skills to speed.<br><br>well, i only driven in Singapore for 2 months only during my assignment there, adapting to left-side is so difficult. but oh man, 2 months have taught me how to be ALERT and expect the unexpected in Singapore roads. 2 near collisions with P-plates and 1 collision with a semi-drunk driver. well, not my car, it's rented.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm... what company did u rent it frm? Anyway, even though it's rented, u'll still have to pay for the damages (i think).<br><br>It's a typo on my part, a BMW 318, I am driving that is. Though it doesn't feel or look like anything, it does have something to show in the long run.<br><br>I ought to be looking for a new car soon (of course it would be another BMW), as it is getting on my nerves with some engine problem. Sent it to the agent for repair and they couldn't find that problem. It only happens in a long run...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Well Ponders, what do u think of the Z3  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> (or Z8 when it comes up on the local market) to a Audi TT? Looking at these two cars makes me drool.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>jeff007 i rented from Hertz, well it is damaged, but I had insurance and downtime is paid by insurance, the deductible by my company.<br><br>yeah z8, have not really gone drooling over yet, but it looked nice in James Bond, sadly, it lasted for quite short while.<br><br>Audi TT is not bad at all. It looks futuristic. I am not too sure about it, but I think it is using VW engine. But since it would be standard transmission (dun think it comes in auto) so i guess you dun have to worry about VW's lethargic auto transmission.<br>Not sure about Singapore models... but they come in 180 or 225 hp engines<br><br>Z3 have been around for quite a while. actually. WHich are you looking the coupe or the Roadster? which are you looking at the 1.8 2.0 2.3 or 2.8l? But it seems the Z-series have remarkable fuel ecomnomy. Infact, the 2.8 l version consumes less than a 318 at 193hp.(talking about European versions) About 10.4 ltr/100km<br><br>Looks like you love Roadsters/Boxsters. Well, I am more into Saloons but I still like Roadsters. Looks like you like European too. Same here, I dun really like Japanese and american cars. European cars are product of fine engineering. But they consume lots of fuel though.<br><br>Is BMW M5 coming to Singapore? I dun think it will since not many S'poreans would want a 5 litre Saloon for a price that could buy a 750 instead. But correct me.</div>
