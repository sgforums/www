            <div class='col-md body'>Well ladies and gentlemen, i think its just simply not fair in saying that S'porean are not responsive in calling........<br><br>In the past, there's only one or at most 2 such charity on TV...... however recently, think we can easily see one such charity show every one or two mnths.......<br><br>Therefore, its already been expected by many that the phone calls counter will drop. Its 5 dollars per phone call...... not 1 or 2 dollars........ i know of some families who really save bit and pieces just to meet a days end. So how many of us actually expected them to donate a lot. A call or two from them will be more than gradful ...........<br><br>Of cos, the total amount raise so far is not good enuff......but i am sure many s'porean have already tried their best....... furthermore, well, there's still one next week..........<br></div>

What can you expect?? Don't expect them to juggle fire torches like Zoe with just few hours of preparation. TCS stars have the time to train for days. Some of them arrived only on the very morning of the show.<br><br>Another thing I very furious about is the target of 650,000 calls. If this is a charity show, why should there be a target.<br><br>Charity is given out of love so any amount will do, instead they give the oversea celebs Mission Impossible III.<br><br>Tao Jin Ying kept saying "Dare no come the next time." Really pity her with the result.She even applogised to the organisation for not reaching MI3.<br><br>*SIGN*  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
