Apparently you once again proved me wrong.<br><br>Of couse my paragraphs would prove senseless to you -- one could have easily compared it to talking to a cow.<br><br>You have missed out one of my points that no one can keep their tempers in check at every single moment one is confronted with a situation one would least want to see. You questioned about his partner not having a bad day -- I would not deny that, but at least if you had read his post carefully enough, you would have at least knew that he tried within his means to cheer her up and light up the situation. I believe this is what he intended to do.<br><br>Did I copy your words? I merely rebutted them. You say that a good person must always put others' needs first... then why not show us how then?
