            <div class='col-md body'>After my thourough investigation using linear regression analysis, I condluded that the underlying cause was your built-up stress resulting from the bad office experince. As a result you were under pent-up stressful emotions and got angry easily.<br><br>Whatever happens is not what happens which made you angry, but why. Why did you get angry. The reason someone is angry is not because of a deed, but how much that deed is within or outside his anger treshold. Because of your anger treshold which went much lower due to recent office stress, therefore you got angry at whatever outlet you can find to explode and channel your pent-up emotions.<br><br>Another important point is, during a special events your senses and receivers will be in a heightened mode. Whatever happen will seemingly take a much more important meaning than a similar act on a normal casual day. You will take these acts disproportionately in your mind.<br><br>This combination of pent-up stress and disproportionate special events significance made you 'blew up'.<br><br>Well my recommendation is for you to start recognize any pressure or built-up emotions you have in you, and slowly calm yourself whenever the pressure is there. Remember it's not right to just channel it into a convinient outlet. Also specifically pay extra care during special events when you have to lower down your heightened and disproportionate senses. If you can realize and identify these factors, you're already in a high chance of succeeding.</div>

Women, unlike man, like to receive attention in small way. You should look at all the details on how you shower your "tender, loving touch" to her heart (dun get me wrong, not physical but emotionally esp).<br><br>4. Take good care of your gal, she will be more responive to you.<br><br>5. Forget your workplace issue, esp when u date with ur gal.<br><br>6. Dun be a MCP... and drop ur attitude... u will need to apologise sincerely to her.<br><br>7. Dun worry for facing her "music" it worth it.<br><br>8. Woman loves to complain, man just listen.

            <div class='col-md body'>I feel for you. We guys like to be appreciated. I think it was a good think that you gotten the roses behind her back. That ought to have surprised your gf. Perhaps she was playing with you, when she said she didn't want the flowers anymore. But yeah, most times, girls like to play hard to get. Read between the lines. Sometimes 'no' can mean 'yes'.<br><br>You got a temper. Don't let your head blow off. Dumping the roses was a no-no. A moment of anger may take an eternity to patch up.</div>

Everyone can 'see' what mistakes may happen, but the thing is what can u do to prevent them ? The world is not in your control. Only your actions. How you react at that situation shows how u handle urself. U can either eat the steak alone.. holding it n being a gentlemen to the end and go about ur business or u can pay ur untouched meals n go crawling like a sad puppy dog after her.</div>
