Yah lah, of course we need to learn, humans are not perfect. Sometimes principles and self-respect boh bian, lan lan... Got this case I was going out with my gf and this ang moh see me and my gf together, i think he is jealous or something... He starts singing... "If i were a man, i won't like my gf to be taller than me."... And yah lah, my gf is 172, i am only 160... but at that time i endure coz at that time i'm still in NS, i had a bright future and don't want to spend time in jail because of such guys... But thought of punching him in the face... but then maybe will be sent to jail... Now I think back, I still wonder if I should be violent, or have I done the right thing to simply ignore his jealous tauntings.</div>
