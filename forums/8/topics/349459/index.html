              <p>i was at a 7-11 along joo chiat when i saw a woman, non singaporean who understood very very basic english. she wanted to buy prepaid card but the counterboy did not understand that so i was there to translate.</p>
              <p>the counterboy took out a stack of sim card (the woman needs a local sim card to put credit in the card). subsequently he turned back to a computer behind him. the woman just took a sim card and inserted into her phone. then the counterboy said that she needed her passport to register the card. to save trouble, i offered my ic to the counterboy and said to register under my name.</p>
              <p>i told my lawyer regarding it immediately and he told me off and insisted that i cancelled the line.</p>
              <p>m i wrong to do that? if u were in my shoe, will u help?</p>

              <p>yup. i know. so i decided not to show any kindness to stranger anymore. as long as none of my business. i will mind my own business.</p>

              <p>but sometimes i think it cannot be helped. ppl will take for granted of the kindness u show them or take advantage of it. like outside airport acting handicapped and having heavy luggages and wants u to carry it for them. turned out inside to be contraband items.</p>

              <p>yup. i know. so i decided not to show any kindness to stranger anymore. as long as none of my business. i will mind my own business.</p>
              <p>now i understand y other nationalities commented that singaporean like us are heartless and audiences.</p>
              <p>but sometimes i think it cannot be helped. ppl will take for granted of the kindness u show them or take advantage of it. like outside airport acting handicapped and having heavy luggages and wants u to carry it for them. turned out inside to be contraband items.</p>

              <p><br>You got the whole thing wrong, dude. You showed the wrong type of kindness which at the end causes inconvenience and lost of money. If you would have interpreted to the cashier and her that she needs to have passport or ic to purchase the sim card, then all the mess of cancelling the card, feeling insecure due to registration under your name, and the gal losing 17+ dollars wont even occur in the first place. Its the butterfly effect, dude. Hope you gotten more experience so that you can make the correct decisions next time. Who say you cannot help, but be smart loh. Even if you are not able to interprete, you can also any other person in the shop to help also. The short inconvenience of the gal going back to hotel to get her ic would have solved the whole problem.</p>

              <p>Most people are not drug lords. Chances are, she is not. Your instinct says she is not a bad person, so she probably won't use the line for any weird stuff.</p>
              <p>If it was me, and if i get into this kind of position, I probably won't worry about it. Your lawyer's advice is true, and he is doing your job.</p>

              <p><br>hm.. yup she wasnt a bad person at first. she seemed normal. i told that to my lawyer and he replied that everyone is normal on the appearance. and he gave me the airport example which i mentioned above. i was like, ok its true. it happens even in malaysia. so i think it all boils down to help sparely</p>

              <p>Something like this, you can always recommend say, "let me help you get a cart/trolley". Then offer him/her a trolley where she can push the luggage himself.</p>
              <p>Or, politely decline, then ask the air crew or some staff to help him/her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is then the smarter way, dude.</p>
