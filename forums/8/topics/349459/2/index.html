              that to my lawyer and he replied that everyone is normal on the
              appearance. and he gave me the airport example which i mentioned
              above. i was like, ok its true. it happens even in malaysia. so i
              think it all boils down to help sparely</p>

              helping people carry baggage past checkpoint is obviously suspicious. So is asking for your IC to sign up for sim card. but neither of it is the case, so the chance that things will go wrong is in reality really low. I won't argue with your lawyer, as his professional opinion that things could go wrong is TRUE. but from my common sense, which is not professional, I will just say it is UNLIKELY.
              
              Why did you consult lawyer on something like this anyway?

              <p>The thing is resolved in a way. But i guess you now know that helping people do not go to the extent of giving money or personal particulars. Do something more generic like help old lady cross the road, bring lost child to police station..</p>

              <p>im glad that nothing happened to me. my lawyer event illustrated that in any event, if the woman is a criminal, the police would arrest me and bring me to a building and lock me in a room. the room is dark and the people there give only the impression of pain. they dont interrogate you but, they give a good bash first. they will make me suffer until i admit that im linked to the criminal. that really freaked me out. thats 1 of the main reasons i cancelled the line at my lawyer's face.</p>

              <p>oo. yup. the idea of offering to buy them a meal is good.</p>
              <p>i was at a food centre at chinatown then i saw this lady selling tissue papers. as usual 3 for $1. i gave her 1 $2 note and she just gave me 1 tissue paper and walked away. i didnt chase her cos i know there is no way she will return the money. then i heard from my friend's mum (she runs a noodle stall there) that the lady sells tissue and every night, she will drink beer there.</p>
              <p>then do u buy tissue from her is helping her? anyway i didnt buy any from her after that incident.</p>

              <p>thanks outlander. its definitely very encouraging. i can say
              that u r the first to say take it as a learning experience. all
              that i have told of the situation said im stupid and dumb to do
              such a deed.</p>
              <p>im glad that nothing happened to me. my lawyer event illustrated
              that in any event, if the woman is a criminal, the police would
              arrest me and bring me to a building and lock me in a room. the
              room is dark and the people there give only the impression of pain.
              they dont interrogate you but, they give a good bash first. they
              will make me suffer until i admit that im linked to the criminal.
              that really freaked me out. thats 1 of the main reasons i cancelled
              the line at my lawyer's face.</p>

              <p>but its not good to keep asking him for legal opinions. just occasionally some matters. for trivia its ok. but not very serious things. its not good to make use of him because of his profession, unless im consulting and paying him.</p>
