Reason being that after he was discharged BY TTSH, he was readmitted into another hospital via ambulance for being very sick less than 24 hours of his discharge. He was then directed into ICU for 4 days due to chronic pneumonia such that he is breathing by a ventilator. Can someone tell me how a patient can be discharge if he is readmitted into ICU less than 24 hours later? Representative from TTSH keep suggesting my dad was recovering therefore was discharged. A patient (with pneumonia) should be fully recovered but discharge, not recovering, given my dad's condition is poor. They (TTSH) are paid, not free and therefore should do their job. For anyone else who experience this, I sympathize. Dont just keep quiet. Raise the issue so that no one else will suffer like my dad.</p></div>

              <p>So far, according to what I know and the experience by family members and friends, TTSH has been more professional and caring compare to the well known unprofessional singapore biggest public hospital.   TTSH service is good.</p>
              <p>Sorry to know about your dad's case.   You would want to send feedback and complaint to their service quality team.</p>

              <p>Given that they are all "garmen-owned" hospital, it should have been free, like Australia. Yes, lousy service, lousy food, and the forever wait, but at least it is free. Private is really expensive and I would l wished to have that option to use them.</p>

              <p>If they are good, no one will be trashing them, right? So cannot really blame us. Probably should have a new thread "Garmen hosp VS Private hosp" Or maybe no point to compare cos private will win flat. Haha...</p>

              <p>Just FYI,</p>
              <p>Alexander Hospital is better in terms of response</p>
              <p>Instead of placing a MO when you walk-in, they will have a senior doctor to attend to you and refer you to the right department immediately, based on his experience drawn from years of medical service. This will in turn clear up queues.</p>
              <p>For other hospitals, MO will first attend to you. Due to their inexperience (mind you, it is not their fault) they will have to perform tests and analyse the results before referring you to the appropriate departments/surgeons. These hospitals believe that senior doctors are better off attending to serious cases. This in turn, will let MOs learn and pick up experiences to grow them into top doctors. And, in time, they will be able to carry out their medical services to us, shall they be able to practice it everyday.</p>
              <p>It is a matter of a particular belief a hospital management adopts. No right and wrong.</p>
              <p>What do you think?</p>

              <p>Is there a place where ppl gives 40-60% of their salary to the govt? Anyway, even if that is true, the govt might not use alot for health services. So might be useful, might not be.</p>
              <p>Maybe there is no right or wrong but a management should adopt based on feedback. I mean you will not allow an intern MO or resident MO to be responsible for a critical ill patient right? Yes those JMO needs to learn but not when it jeopardizes another's life. Their job is tough but unfortunately very important.</p>
