              <p>Most men only want the sex. When it's time to choose a bride, one would choose a prim and proper girl. A man may not choose a bride with loose morals even though his own morals are questionable. It's a pity the child ended up without a father.</p>

              <p>The report is so stupid.. that John is the most stupid of all.</p>
              <p>Appeal what appeal... do a DNA test will determine who is the father.</p>
              <p>Even if that Jane is sleeping with 10 men at that time.. If it is John's sperm that impregnate her... John is still the father, cannot run away one.</p>
              <p>Waste money appeal for fark ? Lawyer earn money only.. use the money to pay for his baby's diapers !!</p>

              <p>John simply enjoyed free sex without the condom. He was stupid for not telling Jane that he will pay for any abortion if required. He can't free rides all the time.</p>
              <p>Bob pretends to be a 'dumb' pilot who knows his woman is 'loose' and regrets marrying her when the marriage is on rocks and claims he was cuckold.</p>
