I know some people on some other forum I visit that have like 10000 posts liddat but your just ridiculous. I think you should call Guinness. or you could sell your account on Ebay for 10 cents per post I bet got people bid for it.<br><br>ok anyways some of the Jin Yong novels have a "moral" behind them, for example tian long ba bu is about buddism(dunno how to say). and xiao ao jiang hu is about how life in the jiang hu is like u cannot control one, the important thing is to do what you believe is right.<br><br>like that lor</div>
