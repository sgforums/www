            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><br>I'm just here to remind you guys that THIS is the Cyber-world, not the real world. There is no need to get so serious. The cyber-world is for all of us to break free from the Real-world, and have a gasp of the "Freedom Air".<br><br>So please don't go around telling people "Hey, don't be childish lah!" or "Grow Up, KID!" cos. THIS IS the place to be childish!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>The behaviour protrayed by a person here is quite the opposite in real life. Let me tell you why.<br><br>If you're a REALLY REALLY mature person, you would want to be young, and I mean real young. Like a small kid. Cos. if you're REALLY REALLY mature, you'll know how difficult it is to live in the "Mature World". And you can't be childish in the real world, cos. people will laugh at you. So where's the place to be childish? The Cyber-world.<br><br>If you're a REALLY REALLY childish person, you would want to be mature. For all those who have grown up already, do you still remember when you're still a small kid and you kept wishing that you're actually older? And so, for a childish person, he can't act mature in the real-world, otherwise people will laugh at him too, "Oi dun act gentleman lah!" or something like that. And where's the place to act mature? The cyber-world.<br><br>But of course, I'm not saying that all people who act mature in this forum is childish in real life or vice versa. I'm just generalizing.<br><br>And since this is the cyber-world, try to take things easy. Let's say you hate a person you met on the cyber-world, and you keep on bearing a grudge at this person. The person you hate may not even care about you! He'll just carry on with his life happily, and you're still there, making yourself miserable by hating that person. Who loses more? You or that guy?<br><br>Welcome To The Cyber World.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Signed,<br>Jack Chen<br></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Elementary my dear boy.<br><br>At least someone talks sense here!!!!<br><br>People get worked up over trivial matters such as Pokemon and deem him to be Childish, perverted or whatever.<br><br>Exactly my sentiments. Some people take Cyber so seriously. This is a place 4 fun and rather childish discussions.<br>If you want something serious then go to a serious forum or better still don't come to cyber at all.<br>I deem myself very sensible (?!), but like to come here for fun and I don't need some ego inflated twat or his stuck up damsel in distress making snide comments on how I should conduct my affairs here.<br><br>And by the way to the two persons concerned... conduct your love affair in private, it is becoming very nauseating for the rest of us. Makes one sick..eh. But of course, I advocate the freedom of speech so......UGGGGGGGH!<br><br>Of course, I may get a response saying that I am childish or whatever (depends on what words is chosen from the Thesuraus)and an additional ear piercing tirade from his sidekick. But I don't care because I am having fun with this.</div>
