            <div class='col-md body'>You must really exercise self control in your thoughts. I do not know how to teach you a sure formula to solve all your problems, but i really believe it can be help but you must make the conscious effort. Control your thoughts and if you're a christian, surrender your thoughts to God. Pray fervently for guidance and wisdom, then again assumming you're a christian. Socialise more with the opposite sex, keep yourself away from anything that causes you to veer towards the wrong side. Since you're bisexual, i strongly believe you still can be saved. Buy books which focus on dealing with such problems and learn a thing or two with them. Hang out with your best friends and take up a sport. Importantly, hang out with the opposite sex more often. These are some practical suggestions i can advise you with.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I pray everyday but it doesnt seem to help.. I firmly believe that god didnt intend to have gays and bisexuals cast out and shunned, but it was misinterperated.. i dont know, but how can god be so for love when he supposedly teaches that being gay is wrong? it doesnt make sense.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeap, i understand. All i can ask of you is to read the Word, the bible. Refer to it. There's this website you can try, hope it helps.<br>www.bible.com<br>Also, keep praying. There's no such thing as overnight answer to everything. If you're willing to deal with it, i know you can overcome it. Give yourself some encouragement by acknowledging it and dealing with it. Do not fear. Hang out more with the opposite sex like i've mentioned to arouse your interest in them. But of course then again, not asking you to anyhow get into a relationship and to prove yourself you're not homo, you engage in sexual activities.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>I would say... save the info for yourself. No one else needs to know.<br><br>How can your parents or friends help you if they know?? Being bisexual doesn't make you any diff from heterosexual folks. You still live like any other folks except that your sexual orientation is diff. I'm wondering how are your parents/friends gonna help you satisfy sexual anything??? unless you commit incest or whatever affairs with them.<br><br>So, let yourself mature with time and see if you change. If not, keep the info to yourself and seek out the respective channels to satsfy your needs in time to come. If you have partner(s), that's abt the only person(s) that need(s) to know. There's no need to declare to the whole world that you are a bisexual. You risk being outcast or discrimination and you invite grief and misbelieve to those who can't accept it, isn't that stupid??<br><br>It's not a crime to be a bisexual and you need not let the world judge you. Live the way you like so long  you don't harm anyone or yourself. You'll be happier.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Homebody's approach is a rather safe option, although it does have the disadvantage in that you could feel that you are attempting to hide some part of yourself.  That seems to be the underlying problem in your initial post.<br><br>I'm not sure what support groups are out there, but I suggest you source them out.  Look at it this way - misery loves company.  At the very least you will have people who have a good understanding of what your issues are, and who may be able to offer you some relevant advice.<br><br>That said, at the age of 15, be aware that your sense of identity is undergoing a huge amount of change, and this has a number of implications.  One is that your sexual orientation is far from being set, so you may be reading too much into things.  Another is that whatever the nature of your sexuality is, you are in the process of fitting it in with all of the other parts of your personality, which ar themselves in a state of change.  This is a very confusing and unsure time, and as a general principle, it is best to take your time in reaching any conclusions - the answer you reach today could well be inapplicable tomorrow.</div>
