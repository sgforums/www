            <div class='col-md body'>I would like to suggest to include nick for the "Last Post" column. It is useful to see straight away whether you are the last poster for a particular thread.....or someone else has make a reply on this particular thread.<br><br>Though we can know by seeing the value on the "Replies" column, but there is simply too many threads to remember. If there is a nick indication, and the thread indicate my nick as last post, then I straight away know there is no new post on this particular thread. If not, we have to click every single thread to see if there is any new post, very time consuming.<br><br>Most forum does have the nick indication, so it will be a good idea to have it here too. This is just my suggestion, maybe you all have better ideas?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is how their power &amp; rep (reputation) system works:<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Being a newbie, you will be eager to posts, add or deduct rep pts, received rep pts etc. But it is best that you know some of the rules set up by Sam, the owner of this forums, and modified or controlled a bit by the "old birds".<br><br>Reputation Points (the icon on the top right which shows a scale) is what we use to increase or decrease a samster's reputation. Being new, many samsters are eager to know the functions but doesn't know where to find the information through all the blaze of forums and threads.<br><br>To add/deduct pts, click on the "scale" and a window will pop up asking you whether you "approve" or disapprove the post, and a comments box.<br><br>By default, the window shows the "approve" being click. If this is being send, that you have increase the samsters rep which will be shown as a green card in his control panel(CP). If you change it to "disapprove", it will deduct the samster's rep pts which will be indicated by a red card.<br><br>If you do not have enough "power", to add or deduct, it will be indicated as a grey card.<br><br>To have enough "power" to influence a samster's rep pts, you need to have a minimum of 50 posts. So there is no point in clicking this function if you have less than 50 posts.<br><br>The "comments" in the pop up window allows you to write your comments, or write in your nickname and the receiving samster is able to read it. If you add pts, it would be good to write yr nickname in the comments, so that the receiving samster can thank you in his own way.<br><br>Now here's 10 points to note about Reputation Points.<br><br>I know this post is a bit long, but WTF (meaning What The Fuck) you really can't go anywhere, can you?<br><br>1. Everyone starts at 10 points. Your posts are also moderated, except ih this forum for you to test. You will need about 2 to 3 days before your posts becomes "real time". So you have to be patient and do a lot of reading first.<br><br>2. If your reputation becomes 0 or negative, you will be moderated. Take note that as a newbie, there are many times your rep will be deducted b'cos you didn't do your homework and check the many thousands of posts before asking silly questions. Also, senior samsters (like me) tend to make a little fun of you, just to "test" you. If you pass the test, you're one of us. KNN (meaning Kan Ni Nia) If you get angry, retaliate, you'll soon be moderated as we will then deduct your reps until you "botak". so stay cool.<br><br>Example of posts that we make a little harmless fun</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">Example ONE</span><span style="color: blue;"> - this is an OK posts from newbie. Bros will joke with him, but won't deduct his reps unless he retailate. If he can laugh it off, and posts to show that, bros will add his reps.</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">Example TWO</span><span style="color: blue;"> - this one ask a question which many bros feel is unwarranted. Poor bro couldn't survive, heeheehee<br><br>3. Number of posts no longer have any effect on reputation power. As long as you have a minimum of 50 posts, you can add or deduct a samsters rep effectively. It doesn't matter if you have 10,000 posts as that won't make you a senior.<br><br>4. One point of reputation power gained every 200 days so make sure you remain in this forum for more than 200 days.<br><br>5. One point of reputation power gained with every 100 reputation points because you are considered "old bird". There are about 10 of them around and we call them "centurions". Don't F--- with them, as together, they can make you see "stars"... kekekekekeke<br><br>6. 2 Reputation clicks allowed every 24 hours so award those clicks only when necessary. Don't suka suka click to give or deduct pts unless you feel the samster deserves it. (of course all the centurions deserve lah)<br><br>7. Reputation spread figure has been doubled to 1000. Means you need to wait at least one and a half years before you can add or deduct the same samster again, so don't need to start counting, you'll never reach there! kekeke<br><br>8. Flames and off topic posts will result in point deductions from me or my moderators (2 have been appointed - they are not members of the forum - they are staff members at my Sydney office. They have a reputation power of 1) . Up till now, I have not bothered to use the reputation system to control off topic threads unless I have received complaints from other members. These are the "god's angels", very powderful ones.<br><br>9. Reputation votes are secret. In other words, you can vote either way without fear or favour. HOWEVER, those who abuse the system by making vicious attacks and spewing vulgarities may have their identities exposed if the victim complains to the moderators. Leave mother, father, family members out of it.<br><br>10. Those who use the reputation system to frame innocent parties may also be exposed. Don't try to deduct and put another person nick in the comment. You will kenna exposed left, right, centre and will not even remember your name.</span><br><span style="color: #444444;"></span></div>
