            <div class='col-md body'>Wah I think the shop must have took advantage of you given that you told them to lie to your dad its 50 bucks. You are stucked in a predicament. Can't confront shop, neither can tell dad the truth? But I think you should tell Dad the truth coz the shop has really qiao zha-ed.<br><br>I've heard of people just drying the fone overnight and next day can work le.
