            <div class='col-md body'>What a loser... going around trying to guess what the other girl is thinking... manz...<br><br>Obviously the girls will act strange if you keep staring at them. It's only natural that a person's eyes wonder on the train, and sometimes it just so happens that two pairs of eyes meet. It's even more natural that the other person will stare back if you keep looking in his/her direction.<br><br>For the first case, my guess is that the girl is more like saying "oh my god, there's a pervert looking at me!" or "eeks.. it's another one of those creeps who think their so handsome, girls will die to be in his arms."<br><br>For the second case, probably the girl was a kaypo and had nothing better to do, or that you and your friend might be discussing something that she's interested in... and of course, we mustn't discount the fact that she could be seated normally and you're the one hallucinating that she's trying to hear everything you and your friend are saying..<br><br>They are sooo many possible reasons and you have to choose the one where you think she's interested in you. (reminds me of the show Joan of Arc)  You simply chose the reason you liked best, and not the one that's most logical.....</div>
