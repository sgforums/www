You look at it and it would electricute you...FUN ahhh..<br><br>Well you don't have to stare at a person while exchanging of sights. You just have to smile at each other.. You definately feel great at the end of the day. Maybe you can start of a new relationship from there..<br><br>Sometimes it feels Odd when two person stares at each other, I think that the best way to feel comfortable is by smiling at the person.. I think this only applicable to the guys as they have to take the iniative. And further more the gal would feel much comfortable in returning a smile. From here you guys can take it away as a Friend.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">F&amp;N <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
