            <div class='col-md body'>I do agree that a majority of female drivers are quite inexperienced in driving..to be more precise they are indecisive...<br><br>They hesitate if they wants to turn right or left in a junction...or they forgot to turn on their signal lights when they are supposed to turn...or they drive slower when they think they have lost their way, thus obstructing the traffic. Either they are too timid or they are too daring on the roads.<br><br>Of course there are good female drivers.I hope to become a good one if I get my license.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 04 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My experience is that they think that they are ladies, so we guys have to let them. so they cut left, cut right without a damn... A few of my friends also like that one. Not all are like that. We guys are also lousy drivers sometimes. hehe</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I love women drivers. I mean who the hell provides more entertainment on the road? And this coming from a guy who was been hit from behind, not once but TWICE, by women drivers. (One of them said she was adjusting her radio when she hit me so I forgive her. Drive-time music IS important after all). I love them too much to hold grudges.<br><br>cheers<br><br>------------------<br>I can resist anything but temptation.<br><br>Oscar Wilde</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A guy once told me that when he takes the double deck buses, he likes to sit on the higher level so that he can have a good view of the thighs of lady drivers (that is those who wear short skirts/shorts).<br>He says that when driving the legs have to be slightly apart so sometimes the skirt will slide up...<br>Juz how true is this, I dunno coz I have not got my license yet...<br>BTW where can I go to get good private driving instructors?<br><br>------------------<br>Fiddle Dee Dee!

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with most people that lady driver cause alot of problems on road, hesitating when not sure, executing a turn sharpely blah blah blah....,but why becos women are more careful creatures &amp; they show it in most of the things they do.<br><br>What abt guys? They are the one who think they're very stylo when they speed &amp; when they get into accidents.....<br><br>Why the rush, where are you going, to get to one point or to meet Uncle Yan? Think before you speed. I treasure my life more than any other thing else.<br><br>I drive very slow &amp; I always remember to signal cos nobody can read your mind &amp; what you're going to do, &amp; I dun road hog I try to give way if I know I'm on the wrong track, good practice that starts from scratch goes a long way.
