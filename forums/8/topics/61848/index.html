            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">by Mamak Cock</span><br><br>Our international affairs correspondent gives a roundup of news from US President George BushÂ’s lightning tour of the region last week.<br><br><strong>Japan: Video Tape Reveals Koizumi Actually Called Bush Â‘Silly CowÂ’</strong><br><br>In a tape released yesterday, it was revealed that Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi had not called US President George W Bush "beef man" after their dinner, as reports earlier indicated.<br><br>Instead Koizumi had called Bush a "silly cow". The transcript of the video tape is as follows:<br><br>President Bush: Yeah, I shore do love beef, maaan... yee-ha! He's [Koizumi] a good friend... And the meal shore was great. None of that sushi shit.<br>Prime Minister Koizumi: Silly cow.<br>President Bush to interpreter: What did he say there?<br>Interpreter: Â“Beef manÂ”<br>President Bush: Â“Beef man?Â”<br><br>President BushÂ’s interpreter admitted that he had translated Koizumi's words incorrectly to avoid an international dispute.<br><br>President Bush, however, disputed the authenticity of the tape. "Holy cow! Koizumi would never call me such a name! We'll have experts check the authenticity of the tape. It probably came from Al Jazeera or Al Qaeda or maybe even Al Gore!Â”<br><br>Prime Minister Koizumi too disputed the tape, denying that he had called Bush a silly<br>Cow. Instead, he criticised the tape as Â“bull shitÂ”.<br><br>In other news, another tape has surfaced, purporting to confirm Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir MohamadÂ’s assertion that President Bush did not take him aside to chastise him, as President Bush has claimed.<br><br>Â“All he asked me when he pulled me aside was, Â‘Hey, dÂ’jew know whereÂ’s the goldang toilet around here?Â’Â“ said Dr. M. Â“I think his staff heard him Â‘dÂ’jewÂ’, which is how lazy Americans say Â‘do youÂ’, so they thought he was hantam-ing me for being anti-semitic.Â”<br><br><strong>Philippines: President Bush Discovers Half-Brother in Manila</strong><br><br>Sources close to Malacanang Presidential Palace in Manila have confirmed that a Filipino man who managed to secure a private meeting with US President George W Bush, was actually his half-brother.<br><br>After months of appeals from the man, President Bush finally agreed to meet the man, Jorge Bastadason, during his trip to Manila. Mr. Bastadason claimed to be the illegitimate son of George Bush, Snr., who conceived him during a CIA sting operation during the Marcos era.<br><br>Â“Well, actually I wasnÂ’t sure about it being a sting necessarily,Â” said Mr. Bastadason. Â“But thatÂ’s how my mother described it.Â”<br><br>Mr. Bush, who was initially skeptical about Mr. BastadasonÂ’s account, demanded that he prove himself.<br><br>Mr. Bastadason said he informed Mr. Bush of how he too had failed the entrance exam to the Philippine Air Force five times, had nearly choked to death on a pretzel, had obtained his job through patronage and connections rather than merit, and was also given to embarrassing lapses of grammar.<br><br>Mr. Bush found the similarities to be too striking not to be genetic, and so embraced Mr. Bastadason as his long last half-brother. Mr. Bastadason will have his name changed by deed poll to Â“Mr. Jorge Bastadasonofa-Bush.Â”<br><br>Malacanang Palace sources, who did not want to be named, have refused to confirm or deny that Philippines President Gloria Arroyo is also now claiming to be Bush's half-sister, while disgraced former President Estrada is apparently claiming to be Bush Snr's half-brother.<br><br><strong>Singapore: Bush's Daughters Found Dancing Drunk and Topless on Boat Quay Bartop</strong><br><br>Jenna and Barbara, US President Bush's famous twin daughters, got into trouble with the Singapore police during his trip to the tiny red irritable dot.<br><br>They had apparently snuck out of their hotel to go to Boat Quay, where they got drunk as usual. Before the US secret service arrived, CID officers from the Secret Society Branch witnessed the two dancing on the bartop naked.<br><br>Said ASP Ah Hia, "Although bartop dancing is no longer illegal, doing so while topless is still not allowed. But since this was a potentially sensitive issue, we decided to wait and watch the dancing for a little longer than we usually do.Â”<br><br>US Secret Service officers who were afraid that any arrest of the Bush twins could lead to their being sentenced to jail or a caning, immediately dragged them out into a waiting convoy and whisked them away to the hotel, much to the dismay of Boat Quay Mats, Makkals and Ah Bengs.<br><br>Â“Wah lau,Â” said witness Mr. Quah Kao Poon, Â“I never thought IÂ’d see the actual bush of an actual Bush, let alone two of them!Â”<br><br>President Bush attributed his teenage daughters' behaviour to his lack of attention as he is too busy war-mongering.<br><br>Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, meanwhile, said the Bush twins were Â“just having juvenile fun, which is allowed for foreign talent.Â”<br><br>He said he has also asked the Remaking Singapore Committee to look into allowing topless bartop dancing by dignitaries' daughters in the future. When asked why he would not extend this liberty to locals, PM Goh replied, Â“Singaporean breasts are simply too small at the moment. Perhaps when they grow bigger, we can relook this issue.Â”</div>
