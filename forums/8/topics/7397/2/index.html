I think I know what makes a great successful man but I'm still chasing some materialistic dreams. But the fact that I do take responsibility for my actions, know my moral values etc etc give me some consolations when everything seems to be falling apart.<br><br>Uglybeast, I think we do need money to survive in our society. However it is not really the amount of money you have. It is more about whether you are living happily with the cash you are making. There are pple whose dreams are not to make tonnes of green but to do something challenging like Ironman or the eco-challenge or join the greenpeace/redcross. To them, they measure their success in live not by the amount of cash they have, but by whether they are to overcome immense challenges.<br><br>Bottomline is don't let others define if you are a failure or success. Let yourself decide. Afterall, we are all artists of our own life.</div>
