            <div class='col-md body'>This is a tribute to the nice girls.. The nice girls that always care for their families, that play their roles well.. they endure their in-laws and was never un-filial towards them.. they are always tending to the kids and at the same time work to sustain the cost of living within the family.. This is dedicated to those nice girls who always stand by their husband rain or shine, always there for him and supportive of him..<br><br>This is in honour of the nice girls not on her good looks, but her good polite attitude and mainly her very soft, gentle tone of voice, which really makes her a REAL woman, who's so different from those other female Singaporeans, who claim to be women just because of their physical appearances... This is in honour of the girls who respect their partner for who they are, without the status that often attribute to most singaporeans girls criteria of a relationship..<br><br>This is also for that time when he couldn't find someone and needs you to bring his mother for therapy, using you as his best friend status, you are always helpful and considerate even thou there was nothing Â“seriousÂ” between the two of you, you went anyways.. Because youÂ’re nice like that..<br><br>This is also for those nice girls that often wanted a relationship rather than just a flirt.. for all the nice girls who always try to upgrade their cutlery skills so that your partner can have a good meal after a hard day at work.. for all the nice girls who are accredited as girlfriend material but somehow donÂ’t end up being girlfriends, for all the nice girls who are overlooked, underestimated, and unappreciated..<br><br>Because of your nature, you are often cheated by sly and scheming guys, who use love as an excuse to get your body, and deludes you of having a decent relationship, for all the time you spent on him, you are nothing more than just a play mate.. you are always there for him, but at times when you are looking for him, his phone co-incidentally went flat, and frantically searching for his whereabouts leaving you like a twit.. this thread is for you..<br><br>Many of them claim they just want to date a nice girl, but when presented with such a specimen, they say irrational, confusing things such as Â“oh, sheÂ’s not my typeÂ” or Â“she would be a good girlfriend but sheÂ’s not for meÂ” , when they are just looking for a pretty lass.. the only conclusion I can form is that those guys are just illogical, confusing prick..<br><br>You are the kind of woman many guys love opening doors for, hugging you to bed every-night whispering i love you, putting away that strand of hair that drops across your forehead, caressing your face while you are sleeping.. till then, don't lose hope, for there are still many guys like me who acknowledge your presence and loves you not for the appearance, but the character and charisma that you possess...<br></div>
