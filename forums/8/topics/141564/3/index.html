            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks Killer Boss for the info. Yes. What your friend said is true for non Australian Uni graduates.<br><br>It is 5 less point once I cross the 30 years line. There are some ways to make up for th 5 points. One is to invest AUS$100K into gov bonds. The other is to have  been employed in Australia in a skilled occupation for at least 6 months in the 48 months immediately before the date of the application, while holding a substantive visa authorising you to work.<br><br>Once you crossed 35 years old, unless you are darn rich, you better hope your skills are super needed by Australia so that you will get 15 to 20 points extra.<br><br>I am taking a bet that the profession that I am going into will remain needed by Australia to get the 60 points. If it dropped to 50 points, I will have to look elsewhere for migration.<br><br>And Atobe said migrating is no big deal...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Make sure you go into a job that is in demand if you intend to emigrate. For the first job there, be prepared to work in less attractive areas eg.rural areas far from civilisation cos that's where they need people. Get your PR first, then you can move elsewhere later.<br><br>But you must be clear why you are emigrating. Not all jobs are better paid in the west compared to Singapore, after you have factored in the taxes. If you are a plumber and can get a job in UK, I say go immediately. If you are a surgeon in Singapore, then I say you are better off financially staying here. Your tax liability in UK is more than 40% and you will have big pay cut. The NHS pays their surgeons the same amount as their GPs.<br><br></div>
