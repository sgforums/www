I don't agree that Malaysia gov is any better than Singapore gov. In fact most politicians around the world care for their own pocket more than for the citizens. Take a look at US. Is it fair to declare war with Iraq when the politicians' evidences are not strong? It is more probable that the war will enrich certain families than the whole of USA.<br><br>I think in migration, what matter most is how well you adapt to your new environment and can you endure the microeconomic trade-offs rather than macroeconomic factors like politics.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Migrated liao ....<br><br>Yah australia income tax is alot but it covers medicare levy which everyone pays unless their income is below 36k . And healthcare is almost close to free when it comes down to hospitalisation - no income means test . True , you might need to wait for certain things but at least you know you won't be dead or broke or get a heart attack from seeing the bill. If you are worried about healthcare - buy insurance - pays for dental , optical to a certain extent as well . U get a tax cut off insurance as well which is a double bonus. Every year I make new specs - go visit the dentist - all covered by insurance.<br><br>No job leh...go centrelink and line up for money lor. But that one ...I don't play with because I got 2 arms and 2 legs to work with.<br><br>What else - oh ya.. the  pay is higher EVEN after tax cuts  compared to Singapore's - u all can work 42hrs .....we just work 37.5 with overtime according to union rules ( don't u just love unions that actually work rather than ones that offer only recreational benefits) .  Breaks are actually enforced in Australia- no one is allowed to work without a break .</div>

Very expensive<br>No rights as an employee - NTUC is only good for booking chalets and buying in NTUC fairprice.<br>Low pay no complaints allowed circumstances.Do or die .<br>When you are old , you have to get support from children unless you have no children .<br>Too "merit based" - scholars who can't perform are still promoted upwards against those who can do better than them .<br>Too competitive - everyone wants to be number 1 . Kids have no life.<br><br>Australia Pros<br>Free healthcare if you are a pensioner - even if you are not - it is still very very cheap because of the medicare system . Just cannot do plastic surgery at public cost of course.<br>Land is big - hence big houses everywhere - houses are cheap and freehold!!<br>Cars are cheap<br>Pensions are given for aussie residents who resided in australia for more than 10 years and are above 65.<br>You can call John Howard names in public and no one gives a shit but must be careful because sometimes got ardent supporters of Johnny boy ( like me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ). I like john howard- he let me into this great country<br>People will stick up for you if you look like the underdog .<br>Better educational prospects for your children<br>No job - take up dole which I never ever do so because I like to be the hardworking migrant.<br>Cheap education<br>Lottery tickets go into several millions.<br><br>Australia Cons<br>Criminal punishment too light<br>Hardly see a police car<br>Bush fires<br>Occasional idiots who think you cannot speak english<br>Occasional idiots who think you cannot speak english yet their english is worse than yours<br>Transportation in some states are horrible but Melbourne is good with tram system<br>Expensive dental but u got insurance then no problem.<br><br>OK let's come to the topic of racism - so what if whites tell you to go home  ...in singapore racist remarks are more rampant about other races . Both country equally racist if you are not of their majority race. Be it white or chinese. No difference.  I heard alot of people complaining about racism in australia but really I am chinese and frankly I don't have a problem with that when white trash makes such a remark .  Singapore is worse - you have chinese making fun of every other race i.e look the mangali ...so or or one.  So when those same chinese singaporeans come to australia , situation is reversed and they complain alot.  I don't have a problem with career advancement - it is merit based.<br><br></div>
