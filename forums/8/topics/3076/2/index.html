And this is how is gonna continue to be.... During your studies life you kena hit by computer virus (This is a mishap, you did your backup?) and meet LAZY people who go around FEEDING on others... So much MORE TRUE this is usually in the working society...? If you can't get through this primary level of life, what would happen to you when ya step into the society in the future...? Poly is a TERTIARY institute, learn to take care of yourself...?<br></div>
