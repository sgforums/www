Look at it this way, girls serving NS will increase our manpower! Besides it will be a morale booster for us guys. I still remember in BMT while we doing PT they were a batch of girls who sign on doing their training there too. There being there actually made us felt that the PT was nothing ( Or we thought as we all collasped when we went back) Anyway, being part of Spore, gals should serve their duty in the protection of our country.

At that time I strongly felt that girls should serve NS. I even propose it a number of times but got no reply from the top. Apparently the top did not agree with me. Look at it this way, girls serving NS will increase our manpower! Besides it will be a morale booster for us guys. I still remember in BMT while we doing PT they were a batch of girls who sign on doing their training there too. There being there actually made us felt that the PT was nothing ( Or we thought as we all collasped when we went back) Anyway, being part of Spore, gals should serve their duty in the protection of our country. Any comments? One last thing, maybe this will help solve the problem of ppl marrying late...."</span><br><br>As for my view Im sort of totally and [b]Strongly</strong> agree and girls should have to serve NS too[/b]</blockquote>Selective reading.<br><br>Thread starter, tell your mommy, sisters, aunties, girlfiend or wife to Join the Army first and tell them you want them to Defend you against the Enemies because they are as strong as any men on the street.<br><br>Then write a proposal to the MoD and tell them to conscript all women into the army.  Write in to Women Charter that this is the only way to be fair and suggest ways to let men get pregnant like this fellow :<br><a href="http://www.malepregnancy.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.malepregnancy.com/</a><br>Then they can carry on their own lineage with self-fcuk.<br><br>After all that combat practice, the women can use it on the men, and propably do not want to be messed with at the end of a tiring day. Besides, with all that male hormones, extra pushing in exercise to be on par with the men, biologically the most useless organs will be shutdown which is reproducton organs - so the birth rate will probably drop and we need to entice more PRC and FT to create the next generation in Singapore for us, SG men and SG Women to get conscripted to protect.   Girls don't mind joining the army but do the guys mind that they had to admit that they are just not strong enough to support their families - so need double income. Now even worse, not strong to protect their people, need women in the war front.<br><br></div>
