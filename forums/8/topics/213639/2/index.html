            <div class='col-md body'>I did get con once as well but I was doubtful during the whole time.<br><br>The 2 girls from china claim that they are tourism and lost their wallets... They kept asking me for money for hotel but when I wanted to help them check in, they refused.<br><br>Then they try to make it sound as a loan and ask me to let them call their relative back in china. They really make it sound real to unexpecting crowds. But I told them that I do not have cash but will help them to check them into their hotel rooms.<br><br>Then they ask me since I can check them in the hotel room why do I have no cash to borrow them. I just tell them that I do not have the pin on my credit card. Then they say that it's not to their tradition that guy check them into their rooms and ask whether I can buy some clothings for them to change.<br><br>I dunno out of pity or out of admiring their acting skill, I agree. Then we went to giordano. They just pick up 2 pairs of jeans and 2 t-shirts. Not even trying and I paid for them.<br><br>I treated it like a fee for entertaining me and the lesson learnt from this experience.<br><br>The best part is that when I actually reported the case to the police, they doubted me for expressing such kindness for these ladies. They thought that there were some kind of arrangements for the clothings that I bought for them. Some kind of law enforcers they are.
