I don't think the guy have the reaction time to do that kind of thing. Or even think of that kind of thing. The mind will go blank the instant the accident is about to occur. Most prob reaction think is to footbrake or handbrake.

A van accident....HAppened when we were all<br>sleeping.  Only the driver isnt.  We were driving on the<br>mountain road.....I woke up suddenly with the van rollin<br>on its sides.

So i pushed back with my legs and covered<br>my family with my hands and saw chaos....<br><br>Eventually the van did stop rolling, reasons which escapes me<br>at that moment.  All i am concerned of is to get every one out<br>quick.
