            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Japanese in shock over schoolgirl stabbing </strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Koizumi asks parents to reflect on how to raise kids </span><br><br>TOKYO - Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi yesterday called on parents to reflect on how they raise their children as Japan reeled in shock after an 11-year-old schoolgirl slashed her classmate to death, apparently over an exchange of e-mail.<br><br>Satomi Mitarai, 12, died from massive blood loss after being stabbed by a classmate with a papercraft knife on Tuesday during her lunch break at the Okubo Elementary School in the south-western Japanese city of Sasebo.<br><br>Police said yesterday they were still investigating the motive of the killing that has stunned Japan, a country which had long prided itself on being relatively crime-free.<br><br>'I wonder how murder could ever take place between two elementary schoolgirls,' Mr Koizumi told a parliament committee when asked to comment on the incident.<br><br>'The incident was harrowing...and beyond our imagination. It is the responsibility of adults to think seriously how we should raise children,' he said, adding that the key to a good upbringing was affection from parents.<br><br>Mr Koizumi has three sons. He divorced his wife in 1983 when she was pregnant with his third child. He has never met his youngest son.<br><br>'An educator told me when I was young that the principle of educating children is to hold them tight, put them down gently and then make them walk. I think this says it all,' he said.<br><br>The Japanese leader also criticised parents who leave babies alone in their bedrooms before they turn one or two years old.<br><br>Satomi's attacker was quoted as telling police that she had called the victim to a study room, where she slit her neck and arms with a papercraft cutter, and left her to bleed to death.<br><br>The attacker, whose name was withheld as she is a minor, then returned to the classroom with her clothes bloodstained.<br><br>Paramedics said the victim's neck was cut so extensively that they could not take her pulse.<br><br>Local media reports told the story of a friendship between two classmates - who regularly left notes on each other's home pages and used text messaging - suddenly going awry.<br><br>Japan Broadcasting Corp said the girl had 'trouble over what Satomi posted on the website the girl was operating'.<br><br>The daily Asahi Shimbun's website quoted the suspect as telling investigators: 'I didn't think what she wrote on the home page was funny, so I called her out of the classroom. I meant to kill her.'<br><br>Other students recalled the two girls fighting during a recent school sporting event, Nippon Television Network reported.<br><br>'I am sorry. I am sorry,' the girl was quoted by the daily Yomiuri Shimbun as tearfully telling police during questioning.<br><br>Japanese media said the girl would appear before a family court, which could send her to a special reformatory for children.<br><br>The victim's widowed father, who lives alone with her and her older brother, said he was in shock.<br><br>'That my daughter could no longer be with me is unbelievable. But the unbelievable has happened,' Mr Kyoji Mitarai, the local bureau chief of the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper, told reporters.<br><br>'She was like air to me.'<br><br><strong>DEADLY KIDS</strong><br><br>Â• In 1997, a 14-year-old schoolboy horrified the nation by murdering two children and leaving the severed head of one of them outside the gates of a school in Kobe, western Japan.<br><br>Â• In 2000, a 17-year-old youth stabbed a housewife in Toyokawa, Aichi prefecture. In the same year, another 17-year-old hijacked a highway bus, killing a woman and injuring five passengers.<br><br>Â• Last year, a 12-year-old boy in the city of Nagasaki confessed to abducting and murdering a four-year-old by pushing him off the roof of a parking garage. In the same year, a 13-year-old boy was murdered by boys aged between 13 and 16, and a 14-year-old girl.<br><br></div>
