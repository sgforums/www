            <div class='col-md body'>I suddenly felt a sense of emptiness inside me. My secondary school life are now my past, it seems to me that it was just like a week ago I was serving my detention. Cursing and swearing at my teachers. Somehow things change now. When the results are given out we see all shorts of emotions.<br><br>I have a friend of mine who refuses to study hard for the o levels, and true enough his results is so bad that he can barely go into ITE. I didnÂ’t console him, I left him alone my other friends say that I am too cold blooded.<br>My female friend from another school called me crying telling me she had done badly. And 1 months before o levels she had revised everything and done all the TYS thatÂ’s wad she told me . And of course her results prove otherwise. I didnÂ’t want to speak to her, instead I want to mock at her . Like how she did b4 the o levels calling me and telling me Â“ huh u still revising ar ? Is too late already, I finish my revision for all my subjects already, now u study like that no use oneÂ”<br>The thing I donÂ’t get is, am I being a jerk ? Scum ? B@stard ?<br><br>I just wanna pass a massage to all the o levels ppl out there, no matter how bad u have done in your o levels. It doesnÂ’t matter is over. Learn from the mistake and change, donÂ’t give up.<br><span style="color: red;"><span class="large"><strong>It is better to aim high and miss, than to aim low and hit.</strong></span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>very nice topic to discuss, =).<br><br>first off, i wanna say that i don't think you're cold hearted, well maybe you're just not as soft-hearted as your friends, but you're definitely not cold hearted. why should you feel sorry or pity someone who does not even sympathize with him/herself by studying ?? all these people know is to procrastinate TOO MUCH that they start becoming cocky and in the end start talking about "if only" and, "i should have"..<br><br>fu<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>ck all that sh<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>it crying over spilt milk, the people themselves fu<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>cking reap what they sow. yes, they may have said they studied so hard, and all that sh<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>it, if they screw up, then they obviously have not tried hard enough even though they have tried hard in their opinion.<br><br>as for the girl who has passed the fu<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>cked up comments about asking you to give up and stuff, she deserved that sh<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>it she got. "bu2 pa4 man4, zhi3 pa4 zhan4" was something that my primary school teacher taught me, and i will remember that phrase forever. congrats if you did well =D<br><br>anyway, about your quote "it is better to aim high and miss, than aim low and hit"<br><br>my opinion is.. if you aim high and miss, you dont get anything? and you shatter your dreams, the fall you take is greater.. even if you aim low and hit, you have achieved what you wanted to achieve, so you probably wont feel as bad. thats my perspective though.</div>
