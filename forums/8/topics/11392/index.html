            <div class='col-md body'>they can be 18-- oso... kids are getting sexually active at a young age now. Abortion may not be the best option, but in some cases it is necessary. You can't expect a 13 year old to carry a baby to full term den keep it or give it up for adoption rite? It can be risky for the mom and child. But i'm not say that abortion doensn't have it's risk. So the bottom line is... dun have sex at a young age lor.

            <div class='col-md body'>it will have to depend on the mentally of the parents,<br><br>if you and her can't gif a good life to the baby, please abort it. be more realistic, if you are still studying how are you going to manage? you are not earning and you will be destorying both your life and the baby. don't you agree?<br><br>i think its fair to abort under this kind of circumstances, yes its like murdering your own child, but both the parents will has its own penalty,<br><br>the mother will be experiencing future birth problems, both of then will have guilts and they will learn from their mistakes<br><br>we are experiencing over population already anyway</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think it's a life &amp; death situation between the poor mother and the baby, everyone will feel bad about having or not having an abortion... those who live on will live with a guilt of causing the death of one/two lifes.<br><br>So I think any negative feelings towards abortion in this aspect is irrelevant.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If the mother will die if she don't abort. Hmmm, thats a different situation. There is no right or wrong for this case, just the decision of the mother.<br><br>------------------<br>The  greatest regrets in our lives are the risks we did not take. If you<br>think  something will make you happy, go for it. Remember that we pass this way only  once.<br>Bottomline :<br>Time don't wait. If you think you might have found the  right one, treasure him/her. Don't let he/she go away. Don't let fear hold you  back.<br>Give it a try else you might regret later... No one other than  yourself<br>knows what can truly make you  happy.</div>
