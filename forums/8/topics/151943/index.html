If it started raining and you are in the middle of the road, wouldn't the big umbrella be useful to shelter all of you.  I mean, try to look at the bright and positive sight.  I don't think carry water bottles and umbrella is odd if you don't want to think it that way.  They are what they are and had bought us up the way they have deem fit.  Are you now going to be judging them by the way they behave ? What goes round come around.... In time to come, would your children feel the same way.  monkey see monkey do, you children will pick up the habit and the way you treat your parent as benchmark and they will treat you the way you treat the parent.<br><br>Do not think that I am lectureing you but I have seen enough to know that we have to learn to accept what is our and how we can live in harmony with your family.
