            <div class='col-md body'>Actually this is very unfair to all the loyal supporters of SGFORUMS, how arbitrary the removal of threads are.<br><br>Everyone is crying FOUL because the moderation should be shared with someone who is impartial and not to anyone who would be opinionated, partial and/or irresponsiblewith it. It's not right to have anyone's posts removed without any kind of REASONABLE explanation. As moderators running a public forum they have responsibilities to the FORUM as well as to the FORUMITES.<br><br>This is not a private message board. It's been put up as a public forum and should be run like one.<br><br>I also don't understand why threads are removed and some aren't. Can we get some kind of explanation on this? I understand that some threads may be offensive and invade privacy, but as moderators, you should be systematic and fair. If you delete one then you delete all, if not, what are the explanations for doing so? After all, people do spend time typing their messages in. Look at it as deleting people's ideas and work. Noone will like it. It's just the same as one day someone were to wipe out SGForums because they didn't like it. I believe that there was an incident which was done with a very early incarnation of sggirls by the ISP. I'm sur eit wasn't a nice experience. Sama sama.<br><br>The moderator should compile a GUIDELINE to review complaints and/or threads which are deemed improper.  It won't solve every problem, but it will give the moderator and everyone else a guage to work with.<br><br>Everyone should remember this:<br>"THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT!!!!"<br><br>That being said, this saga should come to an end with an apology from the moderator and reinstatement of user access levels in #SGCAFE.(whether got your fault or not)<br><br>In future, the moderator must have FULL control of what is done and not done in his/her forum. His responsibility must be clear in who has access for moderation and why also. Moderators are accountable to the users!<br><br>It would behoove the moderators to remember that the Users are correct. All the time...<br><br>If you need help drafting up some preliminary guidelines to avoid this abuse from both sides next time, let me know. I will work it into my 20 hour schedule.<br><br>Let's improve the situation.<br><br>firewire</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nepotism and favouritism sucks as it wil only encourage more bootlicking and values like impartiality and fairness goes out the window faster than Superman changing in a phone booth.I sometimes wonder how come moderators are so quiet,then suddenly pop out of the woodwork becos of some undesirble topics while before other topics which are more undersirable are left to a natural death of being overtaken by new topics.A explanation will certainly clear the air and make some forumnites understand the basis of your moderation.Everyone one of us here is equal regardles of relationship to anyone important and besides,in a forum board,flaming is ineveitable.It is best a person under flaming settles it on his own rather than call for some help from a higher authority whichs will smack of nepotism to others,heeheh  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Theory Of Relativity<br>Eating a lot of good food will make 1 hour seem like 5 minutes while eating lotsa horrigible cooked veggies will make 5 minutes seem like 1 hour <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">~~~<br>Waiting for Diablo 2 Add-on <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why are the moderators practising double standards?! This is really disgusting! Wasn't this forum all for the promotion of freedom of speech?! I don't see in anyway the topics concerned any more agonising in comparison to C++ logic's postings. And where were the moderators when they were needed most? At least practise a satisfactory degree of consistency in your moderations. I don't call it moderation. I call it favouritism. This just plain sucks. Oh yeah, a piece of advice for you people. You want any topics removed? Go "suck up" to the relevant authorities!<br><br>[This message has been edited by freedom of speech (edited 13 November 2000).]</div>
