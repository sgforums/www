              <p>LONDON - Tributes poured in on Sunday for a teenage actor who was stabbed to death during a fight outside a pub that left three other men with serious knife wounds</p>
              <p>Robert Knox, 18, was fatally wounded during the "large disturbance" outside the Metro Bar on Station Road, Sidcup, Kent, in the early hours of Saturday morning.</p>
              <p>Friends and relatives left bunches of flowers outside the bar, and a stream of messages were posted on social networking Web site Facebook and the International Movie Database Web site.</p>
              <p>The teenager had a small part in the forthcoming film Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince.</p>
              <p>His parents Sally and Colin Knox, of Maidstone Road, Sidcup, said in a statement: "Rob was kind and thoughtful and would always help out others -- he would always spend his last penny on other people instead of himself.</p>
              <p>"The life and soul of the party, he was very outgoing, loved sports, and would always strike up a conversation with people.</p>
              <p>"He was respectful to others and adored by all his family and friends. He was asset to the family."</p>
              <p>Three of his friends also sustained serious injuries in the incident: a 21-year-old was stabbed in the neck, a 16-year-old in the chest and a third man, aged in his late teens or early 20s, sustained stab wounds to his hand.</p>
              <p>The 21-year-old is still receiving hospital treatment, while the other two have been discharged.</p>
              <p>A fifth man, 21, was taken to hospital suffering facial injuries. He was later discharged, and has been arrested on suspicion of murder.</p>
              <p>Scotland Yard said they did not believe the incident to be gang-related.</p>
              <p>Knife crime has blighted London in recent months.</p>
              <p>Earlier this month, a man was knifed to death on Oxford Street, one of the busiest shopping areas in the country, and 16-year-old Jimmy Mizen died after his throat was slashed after declining to become involved in a fight with a man in a bakery.</p>
