At least its love he's giving (I like giving love too!).<br><br>Shunning someone just because he's different, thereby forcing him to indulge in promiscuity to get love - thats the disgrace!<br><br>Anyway, it is said that men use love to get sex, women use sex to get love.

            <div class='col-md body'>Here's a character break down IMHO.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by caramon:<br>Peter comes from a well-to-do family.. since young, he got what he wants.. He's cute although fat.. he's spoilt, but friendly.. all of us is envy of him..<br></blockquote>Rich prick from a high society spoilt by parents and envied by poor pricks.<br><br><blockquote><br>After high school, peter is desperate to get a GF since he never have one.. ya ,<br></blockquote>Raging teen hormones.<br><br><blockquote><br>its easy, u said.. since he's rich.. but the problem is, how the hell ,gals know he's rich? i mean you don't go flaunting your wealth to strangers... right !!<br></blockquote>Wrong. He is a self-conscious rich prick to think that he is too rich thus too good for anybody. Thats why he became anti-social (read on).<br><br><blockquote><br>He is lonely at night, friends went out with him because he's rich.. he don't consider them as friends.. just someone to accompany him when he's bored.. but he wants more than that... he needs love..<br></blockquote>How does he know friends go out with him becoz he is rich? Well... he must've been a prick head to be flaunting his riches to gain friends. Else he won't get into this situation.<br><br><blockquote><br>The main reason is, he doesn't drive.. Not because of money but he's scare to drive.. when he's 18, his father often force him to take his driving lesson.. without fail, dad will drive him there , only for him to fail the test..<br></blockquote>3 choices<br>1) You cant force anyone to learn what they don't wish to learn<br>2) You cant force anyone to appreciate what is good for them.<br>3) Being scared is just a poor excuse.<br><br><blockquote><br>He's that determine not to get his driving license that dad got so fed-up with him.. they got into a big arguement and sometimes, you feel that the tie between them just isn't the same..<br></blockquote>Too bad to fight over a driving license. I think parents are much big hearted than that.<br><br><blockquote><br>Peter hold's a conversation pretty well, sad to say, its only with guys.. when face with a gal he likes, he begin to shudder, and you know.. gals don't like this kind of guys..<br></blockquote>wrong assumption. lots of girls are drawn to shy decent guys as well.<br>of course, that is with other factors as well.<br><br><blockquote><br>Soon, peter indulge himself into prostitution, to get all the love he needs.. yes thats not love, but we will never know what he went thru.. i mean we all found love before, but not Peter...<br></blockquote>Err....  no comments. this is called escapism. Trying to justify a need for vice. thats all.<br><br><blockquote><br>For someone who lives in private estate, had what he wants in his life, a great future waiting for him, but in the end scumble to love with a prostitute, is more than just sad..its.. castastrophe... whatever money he have, he hand it all to her.. she 's all that he have.. thats what he thought..<br><br>Its only time before his familiy found out.. to know the disgrace he had done to the families.. they had a hugh quarrel, and peter was on the way out of his home.. he feel sad.. of course he don't want things to end this way..<br><br>He feels tired, everything is so superficial.. the thought of death suddenly came to his mind... maybe i should..</blockquote>Illusion of reality is perceived by the eye of the beholder.<br><br>Prositutes have a life and a future as well.<br>Even till the very last day, Peter sees that he is above prositutes.<br><br>Whats his problem?<br><br>elitism.<br><br></div>
