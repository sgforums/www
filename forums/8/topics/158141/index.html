With all due respect, I guess my letter will not embarass you since I have no previous correspondense with you. I strongly believed I would not regret approaching you in this matter.<br><br>I want to transfer the sum ($113,000.000.00 USD) One Hundred and Thirteen Million United States Dollars from a Prime Bank here in South Africa to oversea account. First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction. This is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential. I am sure and have confidence of your ability and reliability to prosecute a transaction of this great magnitude.<br><br>I solicit your assistance to enable us transfer the said amount into your safe account for onward investment. You can either provide us with an existing account or to set up a new Bank account immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c can serve to receive this money, as long as you will remain honest to me till the end of this important business trusting in you and believing that you will never let me down either now or in future.<br><br>My name is Mr.Henry Fasoys, I am was the personal account officer to a great late INDUSTRIALIST who has an account in one of the top banks here in South Africa. The account was opened in 2000 and he died in 2003 without a written or oral WILL and since 2003<br>nobody has operated on this account again hence the money is floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing.<br><br>The banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than three years without claim hence the money will be re-called to the government treasury as unclaimed after this long period of dormancy.<br><br>The owner of this account is a foreigner and no other person knows about this account or anything concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the manager of the company. My investigation through the National immigration department proved to me as well that he was single as at the point of his entry into the Republic of South Africa. The total amount in this account is USD$113 Million  (One Hundred and Thirteen Million United States Dollars Only).<br><br>As a matter of fact, I have decided to transfer this fund abroad for investment. Your assistance as a foreigner is necessary because the management of the bank will welcome any foreigner who has correct information to this account which I will give you immediately, if you are interested to do this business with me. There is no risk involved in this business.With my position and my personal contact with the manager of the bank, the money can be transferred to any account you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending our physical arrival in your country for sharing.<br><br>We will start the first transfer with Thirteen Million [$13,000.000]. Upon successful transfer without any disappointment from your side, we shall re-apply for the payment of the remaining balance of $100 Million to your account. I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money cannot be approved to a local person here, but can only be approved to any foreigner who has the correct information of the account, which I will provide to you.<br><br>So you should provide me with your correct account detail where you will like the fund to be transferred or you can set up a new account for the transfer even an empty account is ok.<br>I would like you to send me your information as stated below,<br>(1) Your Private: Tele&amp; Fax Number.......<br>(2) Bank Name.......<br>(3) Bank Address......<br>(4) Account Number.......<br>(5) Account Name......<br>(6) Swift Code / Routing Number if any......<br><br>At the conclusion of the transfer you will take 35% for you, 5% for any expenses incurred in this business and the remaining 60% for me. As soon as I hear from you and upon your strong assurance that you will not let me down once the fund goes into your account I will then start to process the transfer of the fund to your account without further delay.<br><br>Contact me urgently for further detail.<br>Thanks.<br>Yours Faithfully,<br>Mr.Henry Fasoys,<br></div>

I am asking for your assistance to lead me to the right channel towards to be out of the critical situation i am now I got your contact from a computerize data following the deep feeling i develope on you after my 3 days fasting and prayer for Allah to give me a trustwhardy person who can allow and lead me to the right channel as a Son , Brother, and cussion. I will make my proposal well known if I am given the opportunity. I would like to use this opportunity to introduce myself to you. well,<br>I am Prince Ibrahim I know that this proposal might be a surprise to you but do consider it as an emmergeny. In Nutshell, My late father was a very wealthy cocoa merchant in Abidjan, the economic capital of Ivory Coast before he was poisoned to death by his business associates on one of their outing to discuss on a business deal. When my mother died, my father took me special because iam motherless.Before the death of my father in a private hospital here in Abidjan,He secretly called me on his bedside and told me that he has a sum of Eleveen Million United States Dollars (USD$11M)Only deposited in a bank here on his name.<br><br>He also explained to me that it was because of this wealth and some huge amount of money his business associates supposed to balance him from the deal they had that he was poisoned by his business associates, that I should seek for a God fearing foreign partner in a country of my choice who can assist me in claiming this fund from the bank for investment purposes, (such as real estate management).but because of the present political problems in this country Cote d'ivoire I want to transfer the money out of the country as I don't know what might happen next. I am honourably seeking your assistance in the following way.<br>1.) To act as the foreign partner of my late father by claiming this fund from the bank for further transfer and investment to your designated bank account abroad.Moreover , I are willing to offer you 15% of the sum as compensation for effort input after the successful transfer of this fund to your designated account in your country overseas.Attached is my personal picture. I will send you all the evidence/proof of deposit once I hear from you. Conclusively, I wish you very best and God bless you. Anticipating to hear from you soon.<br><br>Thanks Prince Ibrahim Musa.</blockquote></strong><br><br>I also kena...</div>

You can either provide us with an existing account or to set up a new Bank account immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c can serve to receive this money, as long as you will remain honest to me till the end of this important business trusting in you and believing that you will never let me down either now or in future.<br><br>My name is Mr.Henry Fasoys, I am was the personal account officer to a great late INDUSTRIALIST who has an account in one of the top banks here in South Africa. The account was opened in 2000 and he died in 2003 without a written or oral WILL and since 2003<br>nobody has operated on this account again hence the money is floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing.<br><br>The banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than three years without claim hence the money will be re-called to the government treasury as unclaimed after this long period of dormancy.<br><br>The owner of this account is a foreigner and no other person knows about this account or anything concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the manager of the company. My investigation through the National immigration department proved to me as well that he was single as at the point of his entry into the Republic of South Africa. The total amount in this account is USD$113 Million  (One Hundred and Thirteen Million United States Dollars Only).<br><br>As a matter of fact, I have decided to transfer this fund abroad for investment. Your assistance as a foreigner is necessary because the management of the bank will welcome any foreigner who has correct information to this account which I will give you immediately, if you are interested to do this business with me. There is no risk involved in this business.With my position and my personal contact with the manager of the bank, the money can be transferred to any account you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending our physical arrival in your country for sharing.<br><br>We will start the first transfer with Thirteen Million [$13,000.000]. Upon successful transfer without any disappointment from your side, we shall re-apply for the payment of the remaining balance of $100 Million to your account. I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money cannot be approved to a local person here, but can only be approved to any foreigner who has the correct information of the account, which I will provide to you.<br><br>So you should provide me with your correct account detail where you will like the fund to be transferred or you can set up a new account for the transfer even an empty account is ok.<br>I would like you to send me your information as stated below,<br>(1) Your Private: Tele&amp; Fax Number.......<br>(2) Bank Name.......<br>(3) Bank Address......<br>(4) Account Number.......<br>(5) Account Name......<br>(6) Swift Code / Routing Number if any......<br><br>At the conclusion of the transfer you will take 35% for you, 5% for any expenses incurred in this business and the remaining 60% for me. As soon as I hear from you and upon your strong assurance that you will not let me down once the fund goes into your account I will then start to process the transfer of the fund to your account without further delay.<br><br>Contact me urgently for further detail.<br>Thanks.<br>Yours Faithfully,<br>Mr.Henry Fasoys,<br></div></blockquote></div>
