            <div class='col-md body'>England brought down the curtain on 77 years of football at Wembley Stadium in desperately disappointing fashion as a blunder by David Seaman handed Germany victory in a World Cup qualifier.<br><br>Seaman was caught napping by a 13th-minute free-kick from Liverpool midfielder Dietmar Hamann which he could only parry into his own net.<br><br>It was a massive anti-climax for the 76,000 crowd who had hoped to give England a winning send-off at the Twin Towers.<br><br>But England coach Kevin Keegan clearly got his tactics wrong and only in the final third of the match did his side look like salvaging a point.<br><br>Keegan had stubbornly reverted to a 4-4-2 system after the success of playing only one central striker in last month's morale-boosting draw with France in Paris.<br><br>But there was a clear public admission that he had got things wrong as for the second half he had switched back to 3-5-2 after his players had look confused in their approach.<br><br>The Germans were worthy winners, always looking more composed on the ball and better technically while England in contrast struggled to keep possession.<br><br>Andy Cole did himself credit up front but Michael Owen had an off day although in fairness both strikers were starved of any worthwhile service.<br><br>It was only when David Beckham became more involved in proceedings that England looked capable of earning a point.<br><br>But in fairness the Germans would have won by a more comfortable margin but for some dreadful finishing in the latter stages when England went for broke.<br><br>Although it is only the first game in a long qualifying group England now face an uphill task if they are to secure the automatic first spot in their group which guarantees qualification for the 2002 World Cup.<br><br>At the end of the game a day which had begun with so much expectation ended with boos as the England team left the famous turf for the last time.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> FnU   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>------------------<br>Thank you for loving me baby<br>You'll always be the one who drives me crazy<br>I think this is a gift from God to have you here..<br>Thank you for loving me baby<br>I'll treasure all your love and all the things we share..<br>And I wanna tell you, how much I love you.....<br><br>[This message has been edited by FATnUGLY (edited 08 October 2000).]</div>
