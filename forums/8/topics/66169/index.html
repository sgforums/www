            <div class='col-md body'>ver 1<br><br>Industrial Training Program (ITP), 10 Nov 03 Â– 03 Jan 04 Melbourne<br><br>1	Background<br><br>As part of the SP course requirement, every Poly student is to go for two ITPs in the second year of the course.  The ITP comes in three forms, namely, actual on the job attachment in related industry, or overseas institutions attachment or as research assistant to poly lecturers.  I have elected the second option, i.e. attached to The University of Melbourne for a six-week course.  There are 12 biotech students going on the trip.<br><br>2	Training Approach<br><br>For this kind of ITP, we are expected to gain experience by going through a special tailored short course by the hosting University. During the six-week attachment, the University has arranged for us to go through all the different departments related to the life sciences.  For practicality, the attachment has been laboratory- experiment oriented, meaning minimum lectures are given, so as to allow us to gain practical experience.<br><br>3	Training Content<br><br>Below is the list of topics and experiment we have gone through:<br><br>Biochemistry- Enzyme Kinetics<br>1.	Kinetic analysis of the reaction between 2 different enzymes on a                       substrate<br>2.	Titration of inhibition of phosphatase enzyme and designing of experiment<br>3.	Kinetic analysis of dephosphorylation in the presence and absence of inhibition to determine the characteristics of the inhibition.<br>Genetics<br>1.	Polymerase Chain Reaction amplification of human DNA to determine human variation at the DNA level<br>2.	Transformation of Escherichia coli bacteria<br>3.	Preparation of plant chromosomes from dividing cells of a garlic root tip<br>4.	Enzyme digest of DNA<br><br>Botany<br>1.	Viewed slides of onion epidermal cells under phase-contrast microscopes using a variety of stains and fluorescent microscopy<br>Zoology<br>1.   Performed surgery on rats and processed slides from a wax-embedded sample using a microtome<br><br>Detailed experimental reports are attached as Appendix A Â– Z.<br><br>4	Methodology<br><br>If the short exposure is anything to go by, we observed that the University trains the students in three prong approach, i.e. formal lectures (as in all university), practical with background principle provided (again as all university), and most strikingly, practical with no formal principle but very real-life topics. In addition, the lecturers adopt Â“Open-doorÂ” approach, in which any student is welcome to approach lecturer for discussion or consultation. This openness enhances studentÂ’s interest in the topics and also allows student to better understand the knowledge, according to their local students we met.<br><br>I noticed their approach to laboratory experiments were very much different compared to the ones done back in SP. For example instead of just noting down what can be seen under the microscope, we were told to treat it like it was an unknown specimen and how we would detail it. At the same time, I noticed the questions in the handouts or practical manuals were not as straightforward and simple as expected, often it requires students to carefully observe the specimens or experiments and research in order to answer the questions.<br>What do we learn from here? In another practical, we are not expected to prove against any principle or theory, but solely to train us to make use the lab equipment, to design a test and to interpret test data and to draw a conclusion.  In our opinion, this is certainly a very important and useful part of the training.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ver 2<br><br>In the 6 weeks spent in Melbourne, it is evident that I have gained knowledge of not only in the course of study I am undertaking, but at the same time it has also taught me how to watch my budget, being independent in a foreign land and most importantly, the art of interacting with people of a very different culture. After all, I am the foreigner, not them.<br><br>During our stay in Melbourne, we have come into contact and interacted with a culture and society different from ours. I have noted a few main differences between our culture and the culture there. In Australia, everyone is encouraged to speak their mind and ask questions. During the first week, where we gathered for a simple lunch with the teaching staff, we were frequently asked what we would expect to gain or learn from the attachment and also what questions we have. Another difference is how a professor and a student at the University see each other. They donÂ’t consider each other as a teacher and student; rather they see each other as a friend and address the professors by their given names, rather than calling them by their designations. The saying Â“ The door is always open.Â” is widely applied there; never will the door or a professorÂ’s office be closed unless he/she is out. Every student is free to drop by to answer their doubts on their course of study or even to invite them for a cup of coffee. The pace of life in Melbourne is much slower compared to Singapore. Most shops and restaurants close after office hours, even during weekends. The only businesses that open till late are pubs and convenience stores. This clearly highlights the fast pace of society back at home. Living expenses in Australia are noticeably higher than Singapore due to higher costs of public transport, food, labour and taxes even though homes and vehicles are much cheaper than in Singapore.<br><br>Throughout the 6 weeks we spent at The University of Melbourne, we were attached to different departments. The first 4 weeks we were attached to different departments each week. It consisted of mainly practicals and visits to the various laboratories in every department. We were also taken around to various campus facilities and research areas.<br>While we were attached to the Department of Biochemistry for the 2nd week, we were told to design a practical analysing enzyme activity instead of simply following the procedures stated on our practical handouts. This came as quite a surprise to me because I have never encountered such a situation where you would design your own practical.<br>During the 4th week, we did an experiment that was not allowed in Singapore due ethical issues. The practical was based on rats and we operated on rats under anaesthesia and removed the reproductive system of a male and female rat and another male rat was made cryptorchid, where the testicle of the rat is pushed into the abdomen. Making the rats cryptorchid were to illustrate the effect of heat on the cells in the testicles since it is known that the sperms are likely to deform and die if the testicles were subjected to body temperature. We then viewed slides from a wax-embedded testis from a cryptorchid rat under a microscope and compared to a testis from a normal rat. We were also taken on a trip to the outskirts to the mountain ranges where we were given a lesson like no other, instead of attending lessons in air-conditioned classrooms, 1 lecturer took us deep into the forest and gave us a talk on animal evolution and some history of plate tectonics accompanied only by the native animals, flora and fauna in a relaxed atmosphere.<br><br>On the 4th week, we started work on our presentations on a topic assigned by our Supervisor in groups of 2. Since the audience for presentation consisted of students not only from the Biotechnology group, we had to make sure our presentation is both detailed and easy to comprehend.<br><br>Besides working hard during the weekdays, we also played hard during the weekends where we went on day tours to scenic locations located on the outskirts like the awe-inspiring Great Ocean Road, where we were amazed by the breath-taking panoramic sights of the 12 Apostles, beautiful sandy beach and the deep blue skies despite being harassed by countless flies buzzing around. We also went to the former gold-mining town of Ballarat where we witnessed what it was like during the gold rush and attempted gold panning. While we were at St. KildaÂ’s beach on the weekends, we had to try the fish and chips there and we sat on the beach and enjoyed the sea breeze and the breath-taking view of sunset from the beach.<br><br>To sum it all up, this trip has been an experience like no other. Spending the money to experience life abroad for 6 weeks and interact with the locals is truly an once-in-a-lifetime experience for me.</div>
