            <div class='col-md body'>well, (according to govt): the eligibility criteria is that the person must contribute to CPF between Jan 98 to Dec 01. This is the period where the CPF cut was introduced. Thats why, the top all schemes and NSS is to 'compensate' for the CPF cut. However to avoid dissent among people(e.g. housewife who have to look after children), those who do not qualify under first criteria can make voluntary contributions to qualify.<br><br>I disagree with your 'getting money from people for govt investment' concept cos<br><br>1. Most people would most probably qualify as people over 21(less students) are working and contributing to CPF. Even then, the money collected from these 'forced contributions' are likely too little.<br><br>2. Govt no longer has access to our CPF funds, as a result liberization of CPF investment i.e, all your CPF money can be used for investment in professionally managed funds and other investment instruments. There's no way the govt can use this money for any purpose.<br><br>I don't find this scheme similar to government bonds.<br><br>open for discussion.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Asure:</div><div class="quote_body">  Close, but not exactly.  It's a simple way to inject $ into the market and stimulate the economy, PLUS taking $ from the rich and giving it to the poor (and what happens to the middle class?).<br><br>Do question why contributions have to be made to the CPF account to be eligible for NSS.  It works like a bank.  Promised returns to get people to put in the $.  Once the quota is reached, bank has a large sum of $ to loan to people (and it sure does want ppl to take loan).  Interest rates is then decreased, and people jump on the opportunity to take loans for personal investments.<br><br>You "buy" the shares with your own $, $ that is already in the market.  But when you liquidate the shares,  arbitrary figures are converted to real cash and injected into the market by the treasury.  Through artificial monetary injection, interest rates are lowered, and here we go again.<br><br>Artificial monetary injection is dangerous as too much of it will devalue the currency.  Thus, the injection has to be slow and the so-called shares cannot be redeemed immediately all at once.  With the proposed allocation of shares, it is apparent that $ is redistributed from the rich to the poor.  So much for "sharing the country's wealth".  While I do not oppose the scheme, I certainly find such propaganda repulsive.<br><br>Scrutinize and you will realize the functions and characteristics of this so-called "shares" are identical to government bonds offered to citizens for the purpose of getting funds for investments.<br>Where does the dividends come from?  The $ you put in in the first place, for the purpose of govt investments.<br>"Shares" is merely a decorated term to falsely imply that you own a part of the country.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Asure (edited 18 October 2001).]</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Did i hear someone saying this is similar to Gov Bonds? hmm don tnk so leh, if its Gov bonds, we need to folk up $$ to buy NSS mah... but in this case, we don even need to pay a single cent!<br><br>Common, Gov reli nice to gif u ppl $$, den don doubt them lah... Like someone has mentioned, it's suppose to inject some money into the economy, juz a variation of a fiscal policy mah... in fact the advantage of this NSS over any fiscal policy is tat Gov no need to tnk, "which sector should i pump $$ into ah?"<br><br>The 50% max withdrawal limit during 1st yr could be as mentioned by someone: to prevent liquidity problem.<br></div>
