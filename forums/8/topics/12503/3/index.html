            <div class='col-md body'>A Sad Story<br><br>The truth is clear and intelligible. But the average person is in a drugged, semi-conscious state. Too intoxicated to feel the real pain being inflicted on him and too unconscious to think clearly. This is the sad state of the typical Singaporean.<br><br>Tell them about the problems of the country and the oppression of the people and they will give you the semi-conscious, intoxicated answers like:<br><br>1) The government has taken good care of the economy despite the Asian economic crisis and they look at the healthy economic growth as the evidence. But they fail to see at the same time that thousands are being retrenched and are currently unemployed.<br><br>2) After they reach retirement age, they can sit back and enjoy life with their accumulated CPF savings. What they don't see is their money is lost in Suzhou and through botched investment deals by the government's investment arm of the GIC. Their money is being siphoned away through inflated HDB flat prices.<br><br>3) They say Singaporeans have an impeccable work ethic and point to elderly people in their 60s and 70s working for about $3.00 per hour or so at fast food restaurants because they 'want to remain active' as the government propaganda machine says, but what they don't see is these elderly have no savings and are forced to work long strenuous hours to earn a living in their golden years.<br><br></div>

What if no matter what happens, the supply will always stay the same (e.g. Land)? Imagine a landlord has 5 rooms to rent out. In this case, the landlord will not increase the rent. A misconception is that the landlord can increase the rent to the level where it covers the loss (from the tax). But that cannot be done because increasing the rent decreases the demand. Since supply is constant, but demand has decreased proportionately to the increase in price, the landlord makes a loss instead. The burden of the tax only lies on the landlord , only at the time the tax of land is increased. </div></blockquote>In short, you are trying to say Supply is PERFECTLY INELASTIC so the incidence of tax falls entirely on the owner of land right? Common, not everything tat we learn in economics is directly applicable and suitable for every case we encounter in life... u ask me to be critical, i tnk u also need to be critical ...<br><br>Land is scarce in spore. furthermore, we are constrainted by the location factor which will definitely affect business. if Wisma Atria raise yr rent, u can say well, i can go Taka and rent. But if they collectively raise rental fee bcos Gov take yr proposal and raise land tax in Orchard and other prime areas by 50%, den what is your strategy? go to SengKang bcoz rental fee cheaper right? but it will eat into yr sales and eventually u might lose out!<br><br>Perfectly inelastic concept is applicable, but not in certain cases.</div>

I am sure u konw so much of econs, u will tell me u want it now bcoz $100 will not worth so much in 10 yrs due to inflation right?

Eg, a period of 10 yrs is long run and 1yr is short run. Den breakup this 10 yrs period into 10 1-yr periods which gives us 10 short run and solve our problem or make a decision abt consumption in each of these 10 short run periods?<br><br>if this is so, yes, we will complain every 1-yr, but like this, it means gov will need to answer our problems every 1-yr and if every yr got such goodies, isn't good for us?</div>
