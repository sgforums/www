            <div class='col-md body'><br>Regarding the liberalization of CPF issue and that Gov cannot touch our CPF savings, i tnk there is a bit of wrong judgement here leh. Yes, ppl can use CPF for investment now, but do u tnk ALL singaporeans will invest? There will still be a proportion out there who prefers to keep their savings untouched, and thus to earn the min guaranteed risk free return of 2.5% per annum. So the Gov will still have some money to "borrow".<br><br>Furthermore, how does the Gov "borrow" from us when we don even put in a single cent? After all, whatever cash proceeds we get frm NSS is frm the Gov (or u might say, frm taxpayers), in fact, its citizens who "borrow" frm the Gov and this "loan" will never be repaid!! Taxes are after all the price u have to pay to live in a society. You cant escape from taxes! (unless one only earns peanuts, den no need to pay loh)<br><br>If yr argument abt Gov cannot "borrow" due to liberalization of CPF accounts for investment, den how abt banks? Banks are subjected to even more risk of ppl withdrawing large sums of money from their accounts, but still, banks managed to use our money to make loans and invest.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm sorry, this story is a typical textbook example, but i feel that it is not appropriately applied in this case. Mind to discuss? correct me if i'm wrong.<br><br>in my opinion, yes, if cheque were to be issued to us, den we will chash it with our bank, who will in turn cash it with MAS. but in order for yr version to be valid, it muz be the case where we simply put the money in the bank so as to allow the bank to further make loans, which creates more money<br><br>the difference in NSS is that, most of the ppl who cash it will want to use the $$. I tnk no one will want to cash it and put it inside the bank bcoz bank savings rate is only a miserable 1% for DBS?!?! and maybe slightly higher abt 2% for other banks? But there is a guaranteed 3% returns for holding NSS! On top of tat, there is a variable component depending on the growth performance of the economy.<br><br>So i hope i can safely assume tat those who cash out their NSS will use this $$. Hence, we will not put it in the bank who in turn cannot make loan with it. Hence, no credit creation, no inflation.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Asure:</div><div class="quote_body">Consider NSS as a cheque from the govt.<br>You take it to the bank, the bank cashes it for you, but it doesnt end there.  The bank passes the cheque to the central bank to cash it.  Eventually when the cheque reaches the govt, the govt will cash it from the treasury that produces the currency.<br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Regarding this quote, consider the case whereby everyone has $10M (due to past savings or watever reason). If all of us keep this $10M under our pillow but one fine day, suddenly all of us decided to use it, will it cause inflation? i doubt so.<br><br>this $10M is afterall wat is supposed to be in circulation, whether we use this $10M today or tomorrow, will not cause significant impact on price level today or tomorrow.<br><br>inflation will arise only if the currency is not backed up by foreign reserves, gold etc. and of coz, excessive printing of paper money which is again not backed up by foreign reserves and gold etc.<br><br>when the demand suddenly surge, the price mechanism will act as a signal to producers who will in turn change production plan to match the rise in demand. so the impact on inflation should be minimal.<br><br>Lastly, money released frm NSS is not simply printed. Its frm past accumulated savings of the Gov. So no printing of paper money, no inflation.<br><br>correct me if i am wrong =)<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Asure:</div><div class="quote_body">   Thus, ppl's money, in arbitrary figures, is converted to real cash circulating in the market.
