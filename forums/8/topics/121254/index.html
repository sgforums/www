I wanted to switch. I like the challenge of learning new things,' said the mechanical engineering diploma holder.<br>The National Parks Board sent him for training under the National Skills Recognition System, where he learnt his professional skills.<br><br>NParks then matched him with its contractor, Kiat Lee Landscapes and Building.<br>The transition turned out to be quite easy, he said, as he had great interest in plants. Also, with his wife working as a laboratory assistant, he could afford the pay cut.<br><br>'My previous job was very stressful, it left me no time for myself or my family. Now, I can plan my own work and time, and have time for courses at night.'<br>His manager, Mr Simon Soh, told The Straits Times the match was perfect. He said: 'Before, people would come for a few days, then quit. They said it was too hot, the job was too dirty, too tough.'<br><br>In Mr Tan, however, the local firm found a worker who was happy to work under the sun and get his hands soiled.<br><br>Indeed, the green bug has bitten Mr Tan so deeply that he intends to go for more horticulture courses and turn 'tree doctor' one day.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">     <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">     <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>..........<br></div>
