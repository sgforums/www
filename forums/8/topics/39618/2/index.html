One of our guys have been infected with SARS and his family member is one of the deaths. And some jokers in my class still going "Heh... Luckly I'm in tip top shape" or "I've been having a coff too... but it's probably nothing." as rationales that they do not remotely have a chance of contracting it despite what happened just a few seats away.<br><br>there you have it, given this, I guess the only way for students serious and responsible about SARS is to skip school and miss out on lessons becos of these bioterroristic jokers.<br><br>It's much closer then you think.<br><br>And yes, the govt. trust in students to stay at home if needed is utterly misplaced... just do a walkabout the school and you can see that it is virtually operation procedure for people who are slightly feverish and sick to go about their school life simply because they can't be bothered or keep thinking it wun be them.<br><br>We are in the field, we know our situtation better then what the MOE. Assumptions is the mother of foulups, and it appears the MOE has made several sweeping assumptions that can have dangerous consquences.</div></blockquote>my colleague's dad passed away due to SARS and everyone there is the least worried about SARS. I've personally driven him to the medical centre regularly for checkups.<br>if its time to get infected and die, just let it be.<br>you think you have SARS? go see a doctor.<br>no fever? you're still okay.<br>what's the point of getting so worried about being infected? if its gonna get to you, IT WILL</div>

How many of you all in polys, unis or ites seriously wans to stop school because you are seriously worried about SARS? I dare say less than 50% of those who are making so much noise just wans a holiday or for the sake of "EQUAL TREATMENT".<br><br>The reason being given is that these people would be more matured to know when not to attend school if he/she is sick. This means, the GOVERNMENT are treating us as adults. If they seriously close down everything, they jolly well close down all companies and all people working can stay at home. What would that come to be? Precisely because workers and students in ITE, Polys and Uni are treated as ADULTS, thats why the government trusts these people will know when to stay at home if needed.<br><br>So, when the government treats u all like kids, u all complain. When the government treats u all like adults, u all also complain. Hard to please huh.<br><br>Anyway, i am now looking for work, it doesnt affect me. But seriously think, if u think the government needs to close down poly and uni temporarily, very soon, companies, businessess, bus drivers, taxi drivers, air stewardesses, pilots, NS men will start to demand they get that right too. See the picture now?<br></div></blockquote>I like the way you say it.</div>
