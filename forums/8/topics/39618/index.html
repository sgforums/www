            <div class='col-md body'>Now the SARS petition that started from yesterday has been reported by the media.<br><br>The fact is,<br>1) Singaporeans find it hilarious. Y?<br><br>1st, As what the ministry has mentioned, polys, Uni and ITE are not part of National Schools. Without MOE approval, the institute could also shut the poly down. So? Y to MOE? shouldn't it be the institute itself?<br><br>2nd, many signatures signed have all sort of nick names, funny comments, do you the gov will take it?when you see such informal petition when you can see all sorts of rubbish comments on the petition?<br><br>3rd, the petition is useless. Just by using common sense. Although gov might be affected by the public definitely it wun be us students.<br>Do they need you to vote for them? NO! so what they have been doing to the National Schools are just for the sake for the parents' concern...<br><br>so guys, let us stop dreaming about closing the school. Well, you go to school just to study ain't that? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>But they do have a valid point.

            <div class='col-md body'>I can identify strongly with why the polys can be closed... morale in polys are low due to this unfairness (they feel that their wellfare is not cared for).<br><br>And as a person confined home due to SARS, I can see how distruptive this can be to school, and also how serious this can be as a threat.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>U think close Poly / Uni / ITEs. The students will stay at home and study meh? It has already proven by the JC and Secondary school students that they are having a wild time in town already! <a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/topstories/story/0,4386,179766,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/topstories/story/0,4386,179766,00.html?</a><br><br>So wat make u think tertiary students would really stay at home? Dont forget that this is the period where most tertiary students gotta rush their project or assignment for submission. So tertiary students would still have to travel ard to meet frds to do projects. Just that the risk arent as open in the campus? *as if* If sch really close, graduating students will be very much affected and perhaps the only few postive points are: students get more time to do revision for the upcoming tests / exams and more time to finish their projects / assignments.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A lecturer from my school said that if the attendence drops below a certain level ( due to SARS ), then we may close the poly down. Anyway I do agree with the point that since the polytechnics have afar larger population institution than secondary schools and JCs, and sometimes we have those mass lectures where you can anywhere from a few classes to a hundred odd people attending and all you need is for 1 joker to be sick and still attend school ( as pointed out in a earlier post) and that few hundred students will all be sick and some may die.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by leucine:</div><div class="quote_body">A lecturer from my school said that if the attendence drops below a certain level ( due to SARS ), then we may close the poly down. Anyway I do agree with the point that since the polytechnics have afar larger population institution than secondary schools and JCs, and sometimes we have those mass lectures where you can anywhere from a few classes to a hundred odd people attending and all you need is for 1 joker to be sick and still attend school ( as pointed out in a earlier post) and that few hundred students will all be sick and some may die.</div></blockquote>Very agree. Somemore we are sharing air-condition lab unlike secondary schs and JCs. Some virus survive better in cold temperature, am i rite?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok lets face it. How many of you all in polys, unis or ites seriously wans to stop school because you are seriously worried about SARS?

This means, the GOVERNMENT are treating us as adults. If they seriously close down everything, they jolly well close down all companies and all people working can stay at home.

            <div class='col-md body'>There's a big difference between polys, ites, uni and working companies.<br><br>Firstly we are students, there's little we can do about it.<br><br>Also, a large number of the people not protected by the MOE oversight at 17-18, the same age group that the JCs are in.

One of our guys have been infected with SARS and his family member is one of the deaths. And some jokers in my class still going "Heh... Luckly I'm in tip top shape" or "I've been having a coff too... but it's probably nothing." as rationales that they do not remotely have a chance of contracting it despite what happened just a few seats away.<br><br>there you have it, given this, I guess the only way for students serious and responsible about SARS is to skip school and miss out on lessons becos of these bioterroristic jokers.<br><br>It's much closer then you think.<br><br>And yes, the govt. trust in students to stay at home if needed is utterly misplaced... just do a walkabout the school and you can see that it is virtually operation procedure for people who are slightly feverish and sick to go about their school life simply because they can't be bothered or keep thinking it wun be them.<br><br>We are in the field, we know our situtation better then what the MOE. Assumptions is the mother of foulups, and it appears the MOE has made several sweeping assumptions that can have dangerous consquences.</div>
