            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, Zoe really achieved her aims. Suzi, I guess you're right. It's a nice and glamorous dress and I guess only Zoe can carry it thru. Imagine Fann wearing that dress, Fann will have been bombarded by news next day about she being very lian and daring. Zoe has a kind of grace.<br>As for Fann, yeah...why does she wants to wear yellow everytime? It dosen't make her more attractive... Although the camera was directed at her many times that nite, I still can't remember what she wore that nite. Anyone can enlighten me?</div>

It's just that I'm embarassed that TCS is pushing her very hard in Taiwan and people there probably think of her as the representative Singaporean. Still cringing from the brown bubble dress she wore on the CD cover. And the chinese karaoke style she sings in that MTV with Kit Chan and Tanya Chua.<br><br>TCS, please invest more $$$ and get her a better stylist and voice coach!!!!

            <div class='col-md body'>You're right, bish. Doesn't mean you like Zoe Tay, then you must hate Fann Wong. Their fued doesn't concern us what. We dun get anything out of it, so why bother?<br><br>But it's not true to say that becos you dislike her dress sense, then you must hate her. I have a good impression of Zoe, but I have no qualms saying that she looks terrible with permed hair, especially that hairstyle in Millenium Bug. She can't carry it off becos she's not the cutesy type. And i'm sure there are a lot of girls out there who hate their bf's sloppy dress sense.<br><br>[This message has been edited by purr (edited 23-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I make it clear.. i am neutral...<br><br>I dun hate Fann But just feel like she is a bit fake... moment of the magic... aiyorr.. just acting cute yiaks.. vomit.... I agree Kit is a better choice. Furthers, always wears those a lian's dress   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  may be her supporters are those Ah Lian Ah Hui may be Ah Beng Ah Seng....<br><br>I dun pro to ZOe, but she looks a bit professional and has her own personality...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>uh...I actually like Zoe....She was my first actress that I liked in Singapore...but now I think she's getting old...sorry "older'.....If u foollow her carreer you will see a trend...sadz to say that she is on the path that most stars follow...As they get older they start to try harder to look as young or be as daring as possible....<br><br>Look at when she was younger, she was more conservative looking than now...then all of a sudden got semi-nude sopread and this dress....Don't get me wrong it is fine, but I feel kind of sad fr her because maybe she is starting to feel her age catching up with all these young girls entereing the industry.<br><br>AS for Fann, she is the mother of all ah lians...I love it!!!!  Her clothes don't match?...I think they look ...like her....it suit sher just fine...I think it suit her more than Zoe's dress suits zoe....<br><br>Just an opinion and commenting on the dressing onli</div>
