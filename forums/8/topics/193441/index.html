            <div class='col-md body'>hi, just my two cents,<br>i would say, we need both theory and practical experiemce..<br>they both complement each idea..<br>knowledge(theory) is needed on whatever you do, and practice of those knowledge would lead to more undertsanding of the knowledge...<br>in other words, a hands on expericence of what happens<br>And easy example is Science ^^<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My take on this is the ideal package is a composition of BOTH theory and practical. However depending on which industry or companies you are in, employers are more inclined to hire practical ppl for practical reasons. Small companies do not have the means to spend so much money and time on theory aspects of business. They feel only top boss need know and then the workers below just do the practicals to start earn money for company.<br><br>I always use the analogy of general and soldiers. If there are only theory generals but no soldiers how do you fight a war with NO soldiers? If there are only soldiers but no solid theory planning from generals, the soldiers are marching towards a massacre. So the ideal should be BOTH generals and soldiers. That is ideal.<br><br>My work experience is a lot of ppl want to do the theory but shun the practical so there is always a constant fight to take the theory positions in company whereas the practical positions are always vacant to be filled by foreign talent <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Going along those lines, of course, a general must start as a private at some point, then later as a lieutenant, captain, major and so on.  Ultimately, when the OC moves up to CO's position, one of his subordinates must be in a position to move up to the OC post.<br><br>Again, along the lines of the military analogy, the higher you go, the more your focus will move from the tactical to the strategic.<br><br>Applying the above to a startup company, the boss starts off as either a solo act, or one of a small number, which means that he's got to do the hands-on work himself.  As the company grows, he gets further away from the hands-on work and more into managing the company at a strategic level.  Take this further down the track, and the boss will find himself not doing any hands-on work anymore.<br><br>That's the theory at least.<br><br>The reality is that if the boss doesn't go looking for staff who have the basic knowledge to follow the path he has taken, he'll find himself having to go back to do hands-on work, since the staff won't be competent.  Further down the track, as the business expands, the boss will require middle-level managers to be OCs while he commands the division, so to speak.  Poorly-chosen hires will leave him without good OC candidates within the company, and he'll then have to take his chances looking for someone in the job market.  Even in successful companies, there's a fair element of this occurring, and if the boss ignores it, quality and business will drop.<br><br>Bosses who hire people who only do the practical work and earn money for the company are being extremely shortsighted, and sooner or later will find themselves doing a lot more work than they bargained for.</div>

Ultimately, when the OC moves up to CO's position, one of his subordinates must be in a position to move up to the OC post.<br><br>Again, along the lines of the military analogy, the higher you go, the more your focus will move from the tactical to the strategic.<br><br>Applying the above to a startup company, the boss starts off as either a solo act, or one of a small number, which means that he's got to do the hands-on work himself.  As the company grows, he gets further away from the hands-on work and more into managing the company at a strategic level.  Take this further down the track, and the boss will find himself not doing any hands-on work anymore.<br><br>That's the theory at least.<br><br>The reality is that if the boss doesn't go looking for staff who have the basic knowledge to follow the path he has taken, he'll find himself having to go back to do hands-on work, since the staff won't be competent.  Further down the track, as the business expands, the boss will require middle-level managers to be OCs while he commands the division, so to speak.  Poorly-chosen hires will leave him without good OC candidates within the company, and he'll then have to take his chances looking for someone in the job market.  Even in successful companies, there's a fair element of this occurring, and if the boss ignores it, quality and business will drop.<br><br>Bosses who hire people who only do the practical work and earn money for the company are being extremely shortsighted, and sooner or later will find themselves doing a lot more work than they bargained for.</div></blockquote>That is true, but attracting, retaining and training staff in a new start-up is easier said than done. That's why most small companies sort out the practical side of stuff first, at least got money in the pocket.</div>

Of all the failed SMEs that I have come across, the most common failure lies in making decisions based purely on expediency.  They make hasty decisions that fail to work out, and in short order these organisations find themselves behind square one, because they have wasted time, money and effort on an incorrect decision.<br><br>In contrast, I have been fortunate enough in my early days of employment to have been part of two rapidly-growing young organisations (the owner of one of which was voted the Chinese Chamber of Commerce's Entrepreneur of the Year), and the common link between the two was that the owners took care to think through each decision thoroughly, examining all aspects instead of rushing to fill a position.  Even though some decisions were urgently required, both bosses opted to take their time to make a late decision, rather than a quick erroneous one that would require them to repeat the entire exercise again.<br><br>There is unfortunately no getting around the fact that decisions, both tactical and strategic, cannot be rushed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So how would you advise a start-up to attract good people? I mean whether the able or the talented, other firms can easily outpay you. Even if you match their pay, the "prospects" and security on the other side will usually seem better.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay, let's problem-solve this one.<br><br>You've started up your own company, and you've done well enough to not only stay afloat but to grow and take on new staff.  As the company grows, your new people will take up the spots that you vacate as you yourself move up.<br><br>In the early days, the infrastructure won't be all that developed yet, and your new hires will probably have to do little less than what you had to do in order to get to that particular point.  The learning curve is therefore still pretty steep for them.<br><br>What qualities are required to perform successfully in such a situation?  A certain amount of intelligence and initiative to work without an established framework, the drive to take on more responsibility in a small organisation and the foresight to see the growth potential of the role.<br><br>If you're not offering as much as the big boys, you will tend to attract two kinds of applicants - the types described above who will recognise the role for what it is, and deadbeats who don't really care what they apply for.<br><br>It's pretty easy to tell between the two types as you go along.  The deadbeats will tend to send generic carbon-copy cover letters with their applications, showing that they're just trying their luck and aren't seriously interested in this specific role.  The winners will demonstrate that they understand the challenges and opportunities of the role.  Of course, the caveat is that your position description must be written in such a way as to convey the right message - this is the first point in which you as the employer can cut corners and shoot yourself in the foot.<br><br>Throughout the rest of the selection process you can assess what the applicant is like.  Does their history (referenced, of course) reflect that they're the type to go out and get things done, or are they the sort to wait for things to happen?    If you bother to test them properly (which woefully few Singaporean employers do), are they conscientious and emotionally stable, or are they the sort to freak out and break down at the first sign of danger?  In the interviews, are they well prepared, and do they demonstrate initiave, or do they wing it and go whichever way the wind blows?<br><br>There are a lot more issues to touch upon, but in the scope of this discussion the above will do to make my point.<br><br>This illustrates two points that I'm making.  In choosing someone for a role, you need to put in the right type and amount of effort, and not go with the expedient options.  If you do it right, it'll be easy to tell the serious players from the turkeys (as a rule of thumb, you get one good one for every ten turkeys).  If you get someone with the right qualities, and who would take the long view and go for something that pays more than just a good starting salary, you've got a winner - grab the bugger and hang on to him.  Hanging on to good employees is a discussion for another day.</div>
