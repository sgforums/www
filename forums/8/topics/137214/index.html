            <div class='col-md body'>Misgivings over the sale of Â‘charity ticketsÂ’<br><br>There has been a multiplicity of organizations selling charity tickets costing typically $2 to $5 in various areas of Singapore. This has been brought to my attention after an unhappy experience with one such company based in the east. Following an interview at the said company, they offered me a post as Â‘event coordinatorÂ’. The job scope specified was Â‘helping out at road shows and exhibitionsÂ’. Other than that, he specified a minimum basic pay of $60 per day, not including monetary incentives if the customer gave feedback for good response. It was only after I attended the first day of work that I realized the job involved selling of Â‘charity ticketsÂ’ and the so-called minimum pay was guaranteed only if we reach a certain quota. Also, I was informed that for every $100 donation, the Â‘event coordinatorsÂ’ were paid $20, not including the incentives if they sold more. After which, I confronted the person-in-charge regarding the discrepancy. She could even insist self-righteously that they are not Â‘selling ticketsÂ’ but Â‘raising fundsÂ’. The issue that I find particularly disturbing here is that firstly, the job scope and the responsibilities are euphemized by ambiguous and generic terms. In addition, there is a deliberate effort to conceal obvious elements of the job such as selling in the advertisement and the interview itself. IÂ’ve came across other similar organizations but none of them concealed the nature of the job as well as this one! Secondly, there is the fact that the employees and the company are making profit in the name of charity. It is definitely doubtful that the full amount is translated into aid for the less fortunate. This not only defeats the purpose of the altruism involved in charity, it also undermines other genuinely non-profit organizations truly dedicated to the needy. I urge the public to be wary of such non-transparent means of soliciting donations.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Last year after O levels my friend went to this company to work.<br><br>In the end, he was asked to sell this 'Charity tickets'.<br><br>If you donate $5, the 'seller' gets about $3-4 I believe. Only $1 goes to Charity.<br><br>My friend quitted immediately.<br><br>And I hate this type of seller. Those put inside the Tong Kong one still okay.<br><br>Why I hate them?<br><br>Once I was withdrawing money from the ATM, and when I turn around after withdrawing, this farker was already standing behind me, and then ask me to donate.
