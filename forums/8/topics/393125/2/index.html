              <p>Why u ask? well because when i was on my way to work it started
                  raining heavily. I thought it just a few drops of rain thats why i
                  didn't bring my umbrella but i was wrong. I was running on the
                  pathway soaking wet then i felt my heel started to chip off so i
                  stopped and just walk lor but fast fast. And all of me are soaking
                  wet its like im bathing with clothes on only this much more heavy.
                  I normally bath and turn on the valve by not so minimum but this
                  rain is really heavy and its hard to see whats ahead of me with the
                  water keep blocking my eye. Then when i was waiting at the traffic
                  light standing there, the kid laughed at me, the apek just stare at
                  me and some few other also. It was so damn embarrassing. And its
                  really cold and wet. I just hug myself to keep warm. Ya its
                  ridiculous but better than me just stone there. Then this gentle
                  guy came to me, he's an office guy because i see him wearing an
                  office wear ma. He offered to share with me his umbrella. I was so
                  happy. Then he walked me to my company building and he smells nice
                  too. He stand really close so the smell just flew in my nose. Then
                  just before he sets off to his company, he asked whether we can be
                  friends. HUH with a guy like that, OF COURSE I WANT TO BE FRIENDS
                  who doesn't?. So i accept his friendship and i pass him my number
                  if anything comes up, just sms me. Thats what i said. See, now this
                  is what i call a gentleman. Any girls out there encounter this type

              <p>It will be a different story if you're a guy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Share umbrella...depends on the person, though if you're a lady there's a higher chance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Become friends...if you're a guy, no one will ask to be friends. Unless maybe the other person is a lady.</p>

              <p>Anyways,</p>
              <p>Coincidence, I used to think like that. In fact, I was scheming to use this tactic.</p>
              <p>But then I thought to myself. Cannot be like that lah...a genuine and sincere action should be selfless, so I should choose an old person (helping the most needed help), and so then I never thought like that anymore.</p>

              <p>omg whats wrong with all of u? if its a right thing to do then
              why the ah pek just stare at me instead of sharing with me? i mean
              it i dont mind at all if he want to share it with me. I AM SOAKING
              WET, i will be the most dumbest person if i were to reject his
              umbrella at that time. And it's just a coincidence that a good
              looking guy happens to come to me for sharing it with me. My fault?
              i just asking for an umbrella to share and he came up
              COINCIDENTAL.</p>
              <p>IM NOT TRYING TO SHOW OFF. Pls understand lehx. This all happen
              unexpectedly ok. I really have no intention of thinking a romeo and

              <p>Why u ask? well because when i was on my way to work it started raining heavily. I thought it just a few drops of rain thats why i didn't bring my umbrella but i was wrong. I was running on the pathway soaking wet then i felt my heel started to chip off so i stopped and just walk lor but fast fast. And all of me are soaking wet its like im bathing with clothes on only this much more heavy. I normally bath and turn on the valve by not so minimum but this rain is really heavy and its hard to see whats ahead of me with the water keep blocking my eye. Then when i was waiting at the traffic light standing there, the kid laughed at me, the apek just stare at me and some few other also. It was so damn embarrassing. And its really cold and wet. I just hug myself to keep warm. Ya its ridiculous but better than me just stone there. Then this gentle guy came to me, he's an office guy because i see him wearing an office wear ma. He offered to share with me his umbrella. I was so happy. Then he walked me to my company building and he smells nice too. He stand really close so the smell just flew in my nose. Then just before he sets off to his company, he asked whether we can be friends. HUH with a guy like that, OF COURSE I WANT TO BE FRIENDS who doesn't?. So i accept his friendship and i pass him my number if anything comes up, just sms me. Thats what i said. See, now this is what i call a gentleman. Any girls out there encounter this type of issue before? pls pls pls share ^_^</p>
