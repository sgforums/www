            <div class='col-md body'><p>Why u ask? well because when i was on my way to work it started raining heavily. I thought it just a few drops of rain thats why i didn't bring my umbrella but i was wrong. I was running on the pathway soaking wet then i felt my heel started to chip off so i stopped and just walk lor but fast fast. And all of me are soaking wet its like im bathing with clothes on only this much more heavy. I normally bath and turn on the valve by not so minimum but this rain is really heavy and its hard to see whats ahead of me with the water keep blocking my eye. Then when i was waiting at the traffic light standing there, the kid laughed at me, the apek just stare at me and some few other also. It was so damn embarrassing. And its really cold and wet. I just hug myself to keep warm. Ya its ridiculous but better than me just stone there. Then this gentle guy came to me, he's an office guy because i see him wearing an office wear ma. He offered to share with me his umbrella. I was so happy. Then he walked me to my company building and he smells nice too. He stand really close so the smell just flew in my nose. Then just before he sets off to his company, he asked whether we can be friends. HUH with a guy like that, OF COURSE I WANT TO BE FRIENDS who doesn't?. So i accept his friendship and i pass him my number if anything comes up, just sms me. Thats what i said. See, now this is what i call a gentleman. Any girls out there encounter this type of issue before? pls pls pls share ^_^</p></div>

              <p>when i was on my way to work it started raining heavily. I thought it just a few drops of rain thats why i didn't bring my umbrella but i was wrong. I was running on the pathway soaking wet then i felt my heel started to chip off so i stopped and just walk lor but fast fast. And all of me are soaking wet its like im bathing with clothes on only this much more heavy. I normally bath and turn on the valve by not so minimum but this rain is really heavy and its hard to see whats ahead of me with the water keep blocking my eye. Then when i was waiting at the traffic light standing there, the kid laughed at me, the apek just stare at me and some few other also. It was so damn embarrassing. And its really cold and wet. I just hug myself to keep warm. Ya its ridiculous but better than me just stone there. Then this ugly guy came to me, he's an office guy because i see him wearing an office wear ma. He offered to share with me his umbrella. I was so happy cos at least I will be out of the rain. Then he walked me to my company building, at least he smells nice. He stand really close so the smell just flew in my nose. Then just before he sets off to his company, he asked whether we can be friends. HUH with a guy like that, OF COURSE I DON'T WANT TO BE FRIENDS who want anyway?. So i reject his friendship request and didn't pass him my number. Thats what i said. See, now this is what i call a jerk, a gentleman shouldn't expect anything in return.</p>
