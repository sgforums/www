            <div class='col-md body'>Wahhh This is from a blog and it is incredibly romantic wahhh evni am a guy i am also touched !!!!!!!!!!<br><br>valentine's day has always hold very little meaning for me. never believe in celebrating love in this manner. to me it has always been kinda silly. walk along the street and see girls smiling and holding ther trophy bouquet, teddy bear etc and couple dinning. really, how unromantic.<br><br>i like to be loved and like to be surprised but best when i least expect it, best when its real and simply. like chum driving me to east coast and we just lie on the beach counting stars and listening to the waves and the time when we just knew each other for a while and one night, he suddenly and secretly stuff a lovely necklace with a beautiful star into my hand. the feeling was magical and sweet. a special connection between us two. and these surprises never stop, like recently chinese new year, he came home on the eve with a cute teddy pajamas for me! and all these is love to me.<br><br>but i am not all that cynical cos i do have wonderful valentine's day that were spent with girlfriends (ha, when we were all young and boyfriendless). and when i was younger i was also excited about which boy will send which girl flowers on this special day in school. and those were the days. i was the center of attraction receiving bouquet and gifts from some boys. it was kinda nice to know that someone likes you and yet so embarrassing. fun but nothing like what i have with chum.<br><br>writing about chum will always remind me of all our wonderful moments,<br>and so just for today, i dug out a blog which i wrote in 2002.<br><br>[8/22/2002 8:39:32 PM | tanya lim]<br>What he did for love<br><br>~I was a clueless, hopeless, lazy, dreamy student, burning mid nite oil, he surprised me with notes and past years papers at mid nite on the eve of our exams so that I may get some last minute help.<br><br>~Each time he visited, he has haagen Dazs ice cream for me.<br><br>~He cooked a special meal for me and I didnÂ’t even turn up, all our other friends got to eat but I know it was meant specially for me.<br><br>~He brought the most expensive Faye Wong concert ticket for me, I didnÂ’t want to go, he had to bring someone else instead.<br><br>~On Mooncake festivals, he brought me to Changi beach to carry lantern. It didnÂ’t matter that I am such a big girl already. One year we couldn't get to Changi, we walked around his neighbourhood and took the opportunity to walk the dog as well.<br><br>~I love white roses, he went to the nursery and brought me all the white roses they have that day (70 over), and it was not even a special occasion.<br><br>~Brought me my first handphone with all the money that he can squeeze out even though we were poor graduates.<br><br>~On a romantic rainy night, in Melbourne, he went on bended knee and proposed to me. It was so touching and so sweet. I cried like a cow, cos I was mean to him the whole day. Everyday, during our one week stay at Melbourne, he brought my diamond ring everywhere. He was thinking so hard when to propose and I gave him a hard time. Gordon tried very hard to help too. The day before, Gordon even baked a cake and suggested we go picnic. I was like no way, its so cold out there. (really I didn't know he was going to proposed, hee hee)<br><br>~We got married at my favourite hotel, Four Seasons and he brought me my very pretty wedding gown.<br><br>~The flowers we had at our wedding photoshoot, was selected and prepared by him.<br><br>~The day of before our wedding, I was relaxing at home while he and his buddies took care of the rest. Everything went so well and I was totally stress free.<br><br>~He is always so sweet, we were at the airport waiting to board the plane, he disappeared and surprised me with a nice perfume.<br><br>~I have block nose and couldnÂ’t sleep well, he rub vapour drop on my chest.<br><br>~Too much tennis had muscle ache, he gave me a massage.<br><br>~On my birthday, he brought flowers and ferns and created a bouquet just for me.<br><br>~I sleep with his sweater on when itÂ’s cold, in the middle of the night, I often struggle to take it off, in his subconsciousness he will pull down my inner shirt for me so that it is easier for me to take out the sweater.<br><br>~He fights and wrestles with me because he knows I love fighting with him.<br><br>~He talks in a silly voice because I love to talk in a silly voice.<br><br>~He buys me things all the time. I donÂ’t even need to ask.<br><br>~He paid for everything in our wedding. He is not even super rich, he is just very hardworking and sure of himself.<br><br>~Whenever we stay home, he cooks dinner on weekends while I play the computer or watch TV. He loves to cook for me.<br><br>~He cooks anything I ask him too and soup all the time because I love soup. I am his greatest fan.<br><br>~In Barcelona I cut myself, it was deep and I was freaking out, he dashed out of the hotel, ran a few miles, brought me anti septic and handyplus. I didnÂ’t even wait very long, he must have ran damn fast.<br><br>~He loves everyone I love, he treats my parents so well and they adore him so much. His favourite kid is Dominic.<br><br>~He knows I am a parasite, he let me stay one. (feed on him)<br><br>~He supports all my ideas and plans though he knows I am fickle, impatient and lack determination. He tells me he knows I have great potential and that I am the kind who will grow old with grace. I truly appreciate his faith and kind words.<br><br>~Even though we are married, he still woos me.<br><br>~He loves me and treats me like a princess.<br><br>These things are important to me. I don't want to forget them.</div>
