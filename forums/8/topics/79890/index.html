I feel that life in there is pretty quiet and lonely.<br><br>Half of my class are ah bengs and the rest dun wanna have any dealings with them and neither do they want to. So i jus join a moderate group. My interests hardly match that of the people in this group and i jus tag along with them till classes are over when we jus heck care each other and go our separate ways.<br><br>To make matters worst, i have seen and faced back-stabbing and many other problems. The 'friends' I've made in poly are the hi-and-bye kind and I wont wanna have any contact with them after poly ends.<br><br>Poly and ex-poly people. care to share your life in there?<br></div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Graduate liao, but loved those days.<br><br>When it comes to such situation, you can't prevent people from backstabbing and everything else lar. Such people have to avoid for sure - duh. You can only secure allies and make sure you have lots of good friends against false ones.<br><br>There are two reasons why you failed to find good friendship.<br><br>I) It's could part of your personality to be passive or act dao when dealing with people. You are not at ease when speaking with people you are not close with, anything other than projects and other superficial thing. When same goes with you, it goes with people that appears in your life as well.<br><br>II) You chose and limit your range of friends you wanna make. Avoid ill ones (backstabbers, etc) - but please lor not every seemingly 'beng' are beng or lousy friends. I have friends from models to downright nerds and I behave the same way. Unless he/she got personality problem - i got no problem in trying to know them better as a person.<br><br>Cheers</div>
