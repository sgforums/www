            <div class='col-md body'>Its weird, like its always something to think about cos u CANNOT jsut have sex with a girl and well not expect consequences there are always emotional strings attached.<br>I believe when making decisions u should see what u want and then see how ur actions will affect others.<br>So if a gal likes u and wants to have sex with u most of the time she also wants a relationship. So what happens if u as a guy really dont want a relationship but obvisiously getting laid is something u want. Should guys be responsible after the sex and go into a relationship?????????<br>I think it would be fair if thought about what they wanted ie either being a fling or a relationship and also draw the line, i feel its really not very fair to use sex as a pawn towards getting into a relationship.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ng,<br><br>definitely a innate advantage the 'weaker' sex has over us. a passing look, slight brush of the hand, warm smile, whiff of cheap perfume and we are rendered helpless.<br><br>the skills of sexuality empowered women and they are picking up on this. even on a sub-conscious level, most women know that a smile, touch and unsaid words all corral men into doing whatever they want us to do. the ones who are most well versed with these skills are the ones that will get what they want. and the lessons begin from childhood. think of a little girl smiling haplessly at daddy in order to get something she wants. what chance do we have?<br><br>cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What an interesting topic. From experience, it was always the guys who initiated things, not me. Anyway, you can take a cue from my overworked bf. He just tells me that he's too tired or he has a headache, hinting that he'll be very lousy at it. Sure to turn me off. If that doesn't work, he'll just say a form 'no', refuses to discuss it, and say, "Oops, sorry, gotta go home now." (He's half asleep anyway)<br><br>[This message has been edited by purr (edited 25 January 2000).]</div>
