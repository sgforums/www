            <div class='col-md body'>Hey guys, i'm tired of talking to the wall lolz. Smsing takes too much effort, besides i have smsed a couple of ppl today heh, my friends.<br><br>So like. This morning a girl from school smsed me before i left home, she asked if i could bring her an extra blazer for her during the exam. Cos it gets really cold in the classrooms. So I turn back and got this extra blazer for her. My dad was all hyped and facist like going "you'll never see that blazer again, they never give things back... wogs! Its just like last time when I...." blah blah blah. So I ignore his racist rhetoric and get the blazer for her.<br><br>So after the last exam. I go up to her to ask for it back. And guess wot?<br><br>She lost it.<br><br>I was not stunned neither was I pissed somehow. Yet at the same time I did not quite expect it to be so, well I did slightly. So its quite Ironic in that sense. Thank you God for numbing my emotions, man this is good. Its like I certainly know if I hadn't prayed, i would prolly be tearing myself up inside, but i'm not. Anyway, think twice before lending anyone anything is what I say  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br></div>
