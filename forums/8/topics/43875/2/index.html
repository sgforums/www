            <div class='col-md body'>It is so damn obvious that jean grey is showing signs of the powers of phoenix.. did u notice all those "fires" coming out of her eyes and at the last scene before she died, she got flames coming out of her? That is so "I am Phoenix, power reincarnation, power made flesh". And at the very last scene when Xavier said "Everythings gonna be alrite" and at the lake, a very faint yellowish bird shadow is in the water?<br>The thing is, the whole story is so mixed up. They r trying to squeeze in many characters into 2 hours. There aint much character development at all.<br>I am pretty disappointed that Storm makes so little power show off (oh did u see how storm always cocked her head oneside whenever her eyes become white???). Cyclop probably beamed his eyes a few times.<br>Although i cannot deny that nite crawler's fight scene was fantastic.<br>And I LOVE YORIKO! She is so damn cool in the fight scene! Even better than anger-is-in-my-ass wolverine. But she being killed of like this is so wrong, she is supposedly the other lover of wolverine earlier on in the comic. And she aint a mutant dude, she is a half cyborg, 1/4 adamantium, 1/4 human (sorta).<br><br>They did show Dr Hank McCoy in a news flash, perhaps he might come into a better scene as beast.<br><br>Actually they r showing the "original" cast of Xmen. Gambit came in really late, so i doubt he is gonna be there.<br>I would like to see Psylocke though.<br>I wish rogue wasnt that weakly power sucking bitch she was in the movie, I prefer her to be the oooo-so-sexy grown up rogue with the indestructible powers she got. She is just too protraited as a damsel in distress.<br><br>Iceman should just get out of the movie and get his own instead, he was never really part of the Xmen and will never be.<br><br>Mystique is again so cool in her naked blue costume, but i wish she speaks more.<br><br>Magneto is so-so in the movie.<br><br>Yeah, i wish apocalyspe is in the new movie though, but that will get complicated since he comes from the future, and at that point, rogue should have her new powers and fully grown (not some plump young girl with fat face and flat hairdo). Moreover if phoenix gonna be back, its hard to say how the story goes.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's very likely the Phoenix saga will feature in Xmen 3.  But the Phoenix saga itself is so convoluted and involves so many characters and sidelines... I can't even imagine which part will they choose to expand on in the movie!  Maybe they will leverage on the storyline of one of the Phoenixs and create a simpler story for the movie.<br><br>But which which which?!<br><br>Perhaps they will stick closest to the comic, and start with the Phoenix force saving Jean Grey, hides her away somewhere but creates a Phoenix-Jean which returns to the Xmen, who later turns bad, joins the Hellfire Club and turns into Dark Phoenix?  That would mean featuring in baddies like the Phalanx and the Sentinels.<br><br>Or would Xmen 3 skip the Dark Phoenix story altogether, but instead feature Sinister who cloned Jean Grey, creating Madalyne Pryor. Then after saving and stashing the real Jean, the Phoenix force possesses Madalyne the clone giving her Jean's memories and powers, who marries Cyclops, gives birth to Nate (future Cable) and then a big battle ensues between Sinister and the X-men over the baby Nate who is supposed to be a super mutant.  This gives opportunity for Xmen 4 to explore what happens when the REAL Jean returns and Scott finds out he married the wrong Jean.<br><br>Plus chance for Cable to make his appearance in Xmen 5 or 6 maybe.<br><br>..... Urk I'm giving myself a headache.<br><br>I doubt Gambit will appear too soon because Rouge seems still too young to be introduced to him.  Plus the romance between Rouge and Iceman is still not developed.... Unless they wanna throw him in to spice things up, but Gambit has an interesting history of his own too.  So maybe Gambit will appear in the 4th movie.  But Xmen 3 could feature the other oldbies like Archangel and the Beast.<br><br>I was surprised that Pyro was featured in Xmen 2 because he has a relatively small role in the X universe.  I think as per comic, he'd save Senator Kelly (or someone or other) and then die heroically in Xmen 3.  Also Lady Deathstrike was disappointing as the token sidekick.   It's totally unfair that Jean had that awful auntie hairstyle, Storm's hair wasn't that much better either.  Nightcrawler was lovable though!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wow, this is so confusing!<br>Apocalyse is from the future lah.. he came back to the past to destroy the Xmen cos they r the resistance in the future. Tats why bishop went back to inform them.<br><br>Anyway, u peeps have tons of imagination! But i am sure Xmen, like all movies, will end with the 3rd. Anything too long will be sucky...<br>I seriously suspect Phoenix will be an appearance, but i doubt they will follow the comic. Come on! the first two episode already is out of context! Its not from the comic at all.<br>So maybe Jean will get phoenix's power and embark on a new story. Anyway we shouldnt be expecting tat Xmen3 will stick to the comic.. So maybe Phoenix will battle Apocalyse. Or Phoenix will fight Sentinels..<br>so we can see a combination of stuff... like fight magneto gang and xavier gang will combine to fight apocalyse who have taken control of the sentinels?<br></div>
