            <div class='col-md body'>I saw Zoe in real person.  She came to my work place.  Even stood very close to her.  Perfect features she has.  Nice skin, with very light make up.  Very big beautiful and electrifying eyes, no wonder people from Mediacorp say that she is more charming in real person than on TV.  She looks 20+.<br><br>Talking about her retirement?  Well, only Mediacorp has the right to decide.  We are nobody to decide for her career.  About her career... well she is not restricted to entertainment industry, I am very sure.  I know little about her.  But I certainly know that she has an entrepreneur mind.  Being an actress will not lead anybody to anywhere.  After all, actresses are just employees, drawing salary from employers.  Therefore, even if anybody here can retire her, it is not so bad for her.  Chinese saying... Gong zi bu chu tou (you can never be successful and rich by working for people), unless you are acting in Hollywood like Nicole Kidman, Juliet Roberts etc,  drawing millions of us dollars per movie made and make a few movies each year (wow!)<br><br>A smart actress like Zoe will not stay in this line forever.  She will retire and focus on business world.  Just like the ex-actress Chen Mingli (she recently made a guest appearance in Who wants to be a millionaire), she is now a successful businesswoman in the insurance line and has a happy family (loving husband and children).  This is what I foresee Zoe will be if she ever retires.<br><br>Yes, I am defending her.  Sue me.  Not because she is pretty... a lot of actresses I met are just as pretty or prettier.  It's because she has an entrepreneur mind and spirit.  I look up to smart women.<br><br><img src="http://a284.g.akamai.net/f/284/987/12h/viewimages.lycos.com/tn/BU009625.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thanks jOhO for the welcome, yes fresh &amp; crisp, bump into this website very recently. never knew it existed until browsing thru other forums.<br>dont have the habit of posting messages unless it's based on reasonable facts n also not my interest to idolise any celebs, they are just ordinary people whose job is to entertain.<br>but can't tolerate unfairness as my believe is everything one does must be justifiable with credibility &amp; am vocal over the wrong perception of merits given to undeserved people who are not qualified as Queen by one best actress award. there were many actresses who won similar award &amp; are improving in their acting.<br>if you expect a person to be no. 1 actress plus retaining her other titles, there must be consistency. viewers expected all her shows to be top rating but unfortunately her most recent show Katong Miss Oh has been rated as no. 10. most viewers were very irritated by her performance being obviously fake &amp; unnatural.<br>It's the truth that she's below par,  cant meet local standard yet how to compete overseas.<br>is this a shame, disgrace, embarrassment, disappointment to S'poreans for foreigners to believe that our best is their worst?<br>if she can prove otherwise, of course she will receive our blessings &amp; applause.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's totally absurd to claim that Zoe Tay's Singapore's No. 1.  We're no longer living in the early 1990s, the world has changed and globalisation has taken place especially in Singapore showbiz where actresses and singers have to go regional in order to share with a bigger audience their talents in a global marketplace.<br><br>Who is Zoe Tay to claim that she's Singapore's No. 1?<br><br>She attended the drama course in 1997 in New York in that same drama school which produced talents like Jeff Goldblum, how come her acting has deteriorated since then and her English sounds so disgustingly Hokkien?  She has been playing the same kind of nu qiang ren aka lao char boh roles since then with no regional appeal at all not to mention Hollywood appeal.<br><br>She can't sing for nuts.<br><br>Zoe Tay?

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by soclose:</div><div class="quote_body">It's totally absurd to claim that Zoe Tay's Singapore's No. 1.  We're no longer living in the early 1990s, the world has changed and globalisation has taken place especially in Singapore showbiz where actresses and singers have to go regional in order to share with a bigger audience their talents in a global marketplace.<br><br>Who is Zoe Tay to claim that she's Singapore's No. 1?<br><br>She attended the drama course in 1997 in New York in that same drama school which produced talents like Jeff Goldblum, how come her acting has deteriorated since then and her English sounds so disgustingly Hokkien?  She has been playing the same kind of nu qiang ren aka lao char boh roles since then with no regional appeal at all not to mention Hollywood appeal.<br><br>She can't sing for nuts.<br><br>Zoe Tay?  DUH.  She should retire.</div></blockquote>yahyah, you not sian one hor..........keep on talking and talking and talking..............about the same thing...........if you dislike her so much.........why do you bother to go and do so much checking on her past and her present? You have nothing better to do is it?<br><br>By the way, i believe you haven't answered my question in the Chen Li Ping post eh? So who do you like then? Tell us so that we can have a good laugh at you..................</div>
