            <div class='col-md body'>Someone was boasting how Zoe is still no. 1 because of this poll and that poll. All these newspaper polls do not reflect an artiste popularity or market worth. These polls are just to make money for the organiser. Zaobao, Newpaper, magazines can sell more copies, internet sites can get more trafffic to their sites, Star Awards earn your money thru the telephone calls and so on. They are just a game and the artistes know that. Getting to be no.1 in these polls is only to make the fans of the artiste feel good. Producers,movie directors don't care about these. They pick their artiste based on other good and solid reasons. So even if Zoe is no.1 in whatever newspaper or internet polls, she may still not get movie roles or regional roles. I am saying this because some of you seem to think that if she wins all these polls, then it shows she is so popular and it is so unfair she does not get whatever role or whatever attention. Get real. This is rather naive thinking and shows lack of knowledge about the real world.<br><br>I just found out another young Mediacorp actress has gone regional. May Phua has a program in Taiwan. Soon there will be more. Many are ahead of Zoe and more will move ahead or her. All your newspaper polls are worthless. So just be realistic and don't expect Zoe to come up with miracles. You can let her age gracefully like Xiang Yun or you can beat your chest and complain and tear your hair out and attack other artistes who have moved ahead of her and give yourself heart pains. Whichever you choose reflects on your maturity.<br><br>But whether you accept it or not, Zoe is already moving down Xiang Yun's path. Her roles are becoming more motherly types. She has a teenage son in Unbeatables III, and is also a mother in her next serial.</div>
