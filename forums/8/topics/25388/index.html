            <div class='col-md body'>Zoe Tay is Ah Jie because she can act and she has staying power. Do we need a new Ah Jie everytime the current one becomes old? Fann Wong will grow old too, so will Fiona Xie.<br><br>I like her, and I feel that she thoroughly deserves the tag of Ah Jie. Look at Lisa Wong, she is Ah Jie of HK acting circle. Anita Mui - she is Queen of HK Pop, also a Ah Jie. Madonna and Kylie - both are Ah Jies of mainstream pop.<br><br>You need certain years of experience to become Ah Jie, and these are the best examples of the good Ah Jies around.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>these are cold hard facts, all these poll<br>results only serve to make her fans feel<br>good. i've also pointed out earlier, these<br>results won't make overseas directors take<br>a 2nd look at zt. maggie cheung, sammi cheng<br>etc are not even on the top 20, you bet they<br>will still be getting movie offers. so do you<br>all see the picture?<br><br>zt maintains her popularity because the media<br>loves her, despite the fact that she has lost<br>many times in voting, she has no offers outside<br>mcs, she has no talent (her acting is inconsistent),<br>no look. but she does has one solid talent(unbeatable),<br>that is her pr skill. all these years, she has made<br>use of this talent to maintain her popularity.<br>however, this type of talent is only recognized in<br>sg &amp; being seen by local media as an artiste's best<br>talent. outside sg, nobody bothers about pr skills,<br>just look around, which popular regional artiste is<br>popular for pr skill ONLY.<br><br>when it comes to BIG endorsement deals, now these<br>advertisers are looking for artistes who have<br>regional appeal or popularity. zt's fans have to<br>accept the fact, because zt has already accepted<br>the fact-that's why she is endorsing 'ba kua'<br>&amp; canned food (it's better than no offers).<br>gone are the eras when local popularity can<br>attract endorsement deals. the key word now is<br>'regional' NOT local.<br><br>another thing that zt's fans refused to accept<br>is zt is always lying about having movie offers.<br><br>once, on 933's dk's late night programme, one<br>listener called &amp; asked her will she be acting<br>in any movies (before the 'the tree'), she lied<br>so smoothly (without stammering), that she is<br>currently going through 'some' movie offers.<br>dk knew there are no offers for zt, so he was very<br>kind &amp; covered up for her by saying 'ya, should<br>consider carefully.' if she really 'consider' carefully<br>would she accept the 'the tree'? it's because that's<br>the ONLY movie offer (by raintree-she should thank MCS<br>for throwing away money just to let her have a chance<br>to act in a movie; this movie was originally slated to<br>be a joint-production with a hk co, but the hk co<br>pulled out, probably because raintree insisted that<br>the female lead be zt). when 'the tree' was screened,<br>raintree conspired with zt &amp; told the media that she<br>has been offered an english movie by a local film-<br>maker (WHO?), their purpose is to fool her fans<br>into believing that zt is very much in demand,<br>so as to jack up the box-office. the other ploys<br>was to arrange for her to take part in jackie chan's<br>car race; got 2 endorsement deals for her.<br><br>well her fans are fooled, but not the general public.<br>the media,1 or 2 really believed, some didn't bother,<br>some are very smart &amp; they can't be fooled, so they<br>didn't give a big write-up of her supposed english<br>movie offer (remember they just squeezed a bit of<br>the news in a small corner). now 1 &amp; a 1/2 years later,<br>where is the movie? zt's fans should wake up by now,<br>stop being duped by her lies. zt is very dishonest<br>about her career moves &amp; i feel that this is very very<br>unfair to her fans. fortunately, the general public<br>are smart enough to see through these promo gimmicks,<br>that's why the movie fared so badly here, not to<br>mention regional (or was it screened outside sg???).<br><br>when it comes to movie roles, it's the same. if you<br>don't have the look or already don't look young,<br>then you must at least be popular(NOT based on poll<br>results from a tiny island)in the region.<br>but even when zt was in her early 20s, she also<br>has no offers, that goes to show it's not because of<br>her age. she doesn't has the looks, at least she<br>must have a very outstanding acting skill to convince<br>the directors to use her, but she has neither.<br><br>did you read the interview of huang shi nan &amp; pan<br>ling ling on mcs website a few weeks back?<br>even her good friend huang shi nan said BACK THEN,<br>he always think that only li nan xing &amp; pan ling ling<br>can act in movies. all insiders know that zt doesn't<br>has a movie star's quality. but her pr skills made<br>the media gave her stunning write-ups (which are all<br>lies-that she has 'ming xing' star's quality) &amp; her<br>fans have all been brained-washed for years to<br>believe all these craps (some people just refused<br>to admit their misjudgements or that they have been<br>fooled), so they voted vigorously for her in every poll,<br>to soothe their egos when they read these headlines-<br>'the queen still rules'; 'the no 1 star' etc.<br><br>some of her fans already seen through her lies &amp;<br>inabilities, but they still support her. their<br>reasons-everybody says she is very good. let me tell<br>all fans, don't support an artiste just because<br>people say they are soooo good, sooooo kind.<br>you should realise that she is actually just like<br>all human beings (she is capable of being jealous of her more outstanding colleagues; she can cry in front of her<br>bosses when neogotiating for a good pay; most of all<br>she is capable of acting kind (to most people, except<br>a few); she is capable of sweet-talking etc to get<br>into everybody's good books)<br>she is a human being after all, not an angel or saint.<br>what if one day, some of her faults are being exposed<br>(there are already rumours that her marriage is a<br>sham-although i would not believe until proven.<br>but still there is a possibility-look at her good<br>friend, local composer/lyricist/fashion designer/singer/<br>stage drama activist's well publicised sham marriage to<br>local jazz singer, they could have taught her the same trick.<br>look at the way she lied about movie offers, she is<br>capable of more tricks than that!!!)<br><br>mel is also spot-on, zt's rival is NO longer fann.<br>they already don't compete for the same roles.<br>her rival now is huang bi ren, xiang yun, aileen tan<br>etc who compete for matured career-minded mothers,<br>housewives. her next tv serial is also playing a<br>mother.<br><br>in her heart, she already accepted the fact (albeit<br>grudgingly), but she is still hoping for miracles,<br>she also want to prolong her fan's support for her,<br>so she keeps LYING about movie offers.<br><br>like what mel said, our intention is not to bring<br>on a war among the fans. it's too childish to argue<br>&amp; argue who is better. the fact speaks for itself.<br>our intention is to tell zt fans, if you still<br>want to support her, go ahead, but please don't<br>embarass her further by saying that she is still<br>no 1 (from those polls), that mcs should give her<br>opportunites to go regional, to do movies, to<br>have good roles etc. mcs has already done a lot<br>for her (her pr skills &amp; crying tactics have<br>helped her alot). look at other artistes, you<br>will realise how fortunate she is.<br><br>be like xiang yun's fans, let her age gracefully.<br>have you all wonder, why is zt not glowing despite<br>claiming to be happily married? that's because she<br>is not contented; she also face pressure from her<br>fans who always insisted &amp; wanted her to be<br>'no 1 sg star'; 'the queen' , so she always has to<br>cook up lies to uphold these empty titles.<br>so she has to spend money buying things &amp; food for<br>people around her, so that they will continue to<br>say very nice things about her (she knows some<br>s'poreans are very naive &amp; like to listen to<br>good things being said of her).<br><br>actually, this fan or mel or whoever, didn't say<br>anything bad about whoever, he simply pointed out<br>the facts that the general public already acknowledged.<br>all fans should be able to rationalise &amp; not be<br>misled year after year.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Someone was boasting how Zoe is still no. 1 because of this poll and that poll. All these newspaper polls do not reflect an artiste popularity or market worth. These polls are just to make money for the organiser. Zaobao, Newpaper, magazines can sell more copies, internet sites can get more trafffic to their sites, Star Awards earn your money thru the telephone calls and so on. They are just a game and the artistes know that. Getting to be no.1 in these polls is only to make the fans of the artiste feel good. Producers,movie directors don't care about these. They pick their artiste based on other good and solid reasons. So even if Zoe is no.1 in whatever newspaper or internet polls, she may still not get movie roles or regional roles. I am saying this because some of you seem to think that if she wins all these polls, then it shows she is so popular and it is so unfair she does not get whatever role or whatever attention. Get real. This is rather naive thinking and shows lack of knowledge about the real world.<br><br>I just found out another young Mediacorp actress has gone regional. May Phua has a program in Taiwan. Soon there will be more. Many are ahead of Zoe and more will move ahead or her. All your newspaper polls are worthless. So just be realistic and don't expect Zoe to come up with miracles. You can let her age gracefully like Xiang Yun or you can beat your chest and complain and tear your hair out and attack other artistes who have moved ahead of her and give yourself heart pains. Whichever you choose reflects on your maturity.<br><br>But whether you accept it or not, Zoe is already moving down Xiang Yun's path. Her roles are becoming more motherly types. She has a teenage son in Unbeatables III, and is also a mother in her next serial.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You've to admit the fact that local media is very influential.<br>they can either make or break an artiste. do you<br>think people can forget all those negative press?<br>they'd successfully made zt, that even many years down<br>the road, people like her despite her lack of talent,<br>lack of look, lack of overseas market etc. why?<br>because the media keep talking about how good she is.<br>do you honestly think that if the media said negative<br>things about zt (like the way they did to fann), zt can survive? No, she will die standing straight. she survives<br>because the media has laid down a very strong foundation for her. from her tnp interview, she was obviously so<br>sore &amp; jealous of fann going hollywood, but why people<br>still don't think she is jealous? if it's fann who<br>answered the way zt answered, you bet the media will<br>have a write-up of how sour she is.<br><br>why didn't the media hound her about her constantly lying<br>about her house renovations (for sooooo many years)?<br>why didn't the media ask her why 1 moment she said she bought an apartment, another moment a terrace, then<br>another moment a bungalow &amp; now back to apartment?<br><br>why didn't they query her about her claim of a movie offer?<br>why did they let her off soooo easily?<br><br>why didn't they give a big report of her sitcom's<br>poor rating?<br><br>why are they sooo tolerant of her BIG LIES?<br><br>i can only think of 2 reasons :<br><br>1) they love her, they pity her, so they don't<br>want to embarass her; or<br><br>2) they've simply lost interest in her anymore,<br>as there is nothing interesting about her career<br>or her marriage.</div>
