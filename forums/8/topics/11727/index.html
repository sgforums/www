            <div class='col-md body'>Check out this log I've seen, a mail conversation between 2 people, one of them a good friend of mine. Apparently he's had a very demoralizing moment recently.<br><br>&gt;U still wanna go out with me?! I thought i told u i<br>&gt;already had someone else in mind! And im happy to say<br>&gt;that the more i know him the more i like him. heehee<br><br>&gt;U noe i was listening to the radio today (news radio<br>&gt;93.8, thanks to my mother...) and it was a &gt;psychologist talking. He said something about how<br>&gt;pple are attracted to pple who are confident and fun-<br>&gt;loving, etcetc and not to needy people. I mean, if<br>&gt;someone keeps asking like "do u love me? Please<br>&gt;love me ok? Everyone else has rejected me!" (btw,<br>&gt;that was a direct quote),that person is probably not<br>&gt;gonna be very attractive. Because then u'll wonder<br>&gt;why everyone else has rejected that person! And u<br>&gt;start to think whether there's really something wrong &gt;about this person....and u start to<br>&gt;worry. I thought that was quite interesting! haha<br><br>and his reply:<br><br>&gt;Okay.<br>&gt;I used to think the problem was with me, but after the sixth one, I realized the problem was never with me, but with the way people are brought up in this hideous world.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;I try so hard to be nice, but people only talk to me when they want something or when they need my help.<br>&gt;The best example after all these years is still the first time. I remember when I was 19 the first one always asked for my help with stuff in school, and i helped her willingly for 3 years. I never asked<br>&gt;for anything in return, nor did I want anything. 3 years. 2 months before leaving school, I asked her if &gt;she'd like to see a movie. She refused, saying she was busy. And then after school on the same day, the ENTIRE CLASS, including her, went off to see it. &gt;And guess who wasn't with them? And they were all sneering at me at the bus stop.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;2 months after we left school, when I was in the army, at the lowest point in my life, she asked me out one day. For lunch too. I thought my luck had &gt;improved. But at the table, she said, i quote,<br>&gt;<br>&gt;"You're not as well-off as I am, and to put it bluntly, you never stood a chance right from the start. And I will never forget how naive you've been."<br>&gt;<br>&gt;It's been almost 6 years since then, and I still remember her exact words, tone, and that look on her face when she said that. How anyone can say something &gt;as condescending as that is simply beyond me.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;All along I've never done anything TO them, but rather whatever I could FOR them. 6 of them never went beyond the 'would you like to go out' stage. The most recent 7th one went out, but left after 1 hour since she planned to meet someone else on the same day, 1 hour after me. The fact that they can plan &gt;something else for an hour after meeting me shows how significant I am in their life.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;When I told the 6th one there were 5 others before her, she said "you must be a real failure."<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Now I'm onto the 8th, and it's only going to escalate further. And going by her kind of logic, I'm going to be even more of a failure by the time I reach the 25th one. But why did I tell them about the others before them then? Because I still believe in &gt;honesty. A virtue appreciated by none, however.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;4 of them said I wasn't well-off.<br>&gt;2 of them said I was very different.<br>&gt;1 was alright for a while, but started totally ignoring me when she found someone better. Ignoring as in I could be standing right in front of her talking to her but she'd just walk past. As if I did some great wrong to her.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;And all this within 7 years.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;That's the reason I HATE going out at night. I HATE walking down orchard road seeing all the happy people &gt;there and then looking at myself, all alone.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;People keep telling me all kinds of idiotic stuff I never knew about myself.<br>&gt;They say I look evil. They say my eyes look evil. They say I'm a murderer. And all these weren't generalizations but aimed directly at me and only me. And the people who said these go to church. They call themselves "christians". I went to the same church as &gt;them. I tolerated all this for 5 years, thinking who cares about them, I go to church not to see them but for the worship. But if they're all against you, it's only a matter of time before you'll break down. I stopped going there 4 years ago, and I've been &gt;happier since then. Not much, but still happier.<br>&gt;I was never against the church. Only against the self-righteous bigots found within its walls.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;But the thing is, people only see what they want to see.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;I used to believe I was inferior to everyone else. All the way until the 7th one too. Now, however, after the way my life has turned out, I feel totally superior to everyone else. I've realized why people talk behind my back and try to pull me down. It's because they find me a threat and never want me<br>&gt;to reach my full potential.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;I used to feel I was unworthy to be with others. That people I held in such high regard didn't deserve to be bogged down by trash like me. But now its dawned on me that, in reality, THEY are the ones unworthy of &gt;me.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;They don't have to waste time in the army. They don't have to suffer unecessarily. They don't have whatever little dignity they have taken away forcefully. They don't suffer 24 hour humiliation for 2 years. And yet &gt;they're always arguing for their rights. They care only about themselves. They fail to see things on a larger scale. They fail to see the world around them.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;And yes, I was unpopular in the army too. And everywhere I go. Because I never stood up for myself when I was wronged.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Like they say, if people keep saying things about you, no matter how untrue they are, they'll eventually come true. By now you probably don't think I'm so nice after all. At least I don't _pretend_ to &gt;be nice.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;And now I understand.<br>&gt;True love is an illusion. It doesn't exist. It never did. It is a false reality created to give us some hope to carry on in this miserable world we live in.<br>&gt;Goodbye.<br><br>What a reply!! And her response to that:<br><br>I believe true love does exist.. but true love doesnt seek to control or to capture, but is satisfied just with knowing that the other party is happy. And admittedly, no human is capable of true love. This only Jesus is capable of. Even a Mother's "unconditional" love for her child doesnt even come close to God's kind of love, which He offers freely to all who seek it.<br><br>It's sad to hear of your past experiences, esp the first one. I mean, come on!! I really wonder what kind of girl can say such things to a guy in his face, or behind his back for that matter. She probably is too caught up with herself to care about others. But well, im not here to judge her, and i dont want to go in that direction. I still think u're a nice guy, one who is able to look beyond the immediate to the big picture, one very rare guy who is able to place others above himself, even if it means suffering and pain. And I still think one day u'll be able to find that special person who'd appreciate u for who u are, not what u pretend to be, or what u are not. I know i really would like this kind of guy! Just one caution though, this person can never fill all the emptiness in your heart. A relationship is a joining of two whole people, and not a union of 2 halves to make a whole. And I believe u know that in every person there is a God-shaped vacuum that can be filled only by God Himself. Not ur girlfriend. Not your family. Not ur friends. Not lizard/ tortoise/etc.<br><br>If ure worried about ur financial situation, im sure out there there are girls who dont really care. Yes, there may be fewer of these, but hey arent u looking for someone special?! And arent u an undergrad? What makes u think u wont be rolling in big bucks later in life? And i appreciate honesty too! I believe that is the key in a successful relationship. Im sure someone else would feel the same way too.<br><br>U dont look evil! In fact, that day when u approached me, i thought u look quite cute. Heehee...and u're tall and lean, so there!<br><br>Ure right too. The problem doesnt lie with you. But try to respect the fact that ur ex-targets are trying to find someone who complements them. Perhaps u're just not their type? In this case, u shouldnt be trying to change. Rather, u should be looking for someone who's your type, who would really love u. Yes, there is a girl out there who is waiting to find u! Yes YOU!<br>Try to get to know a girl better before u fall in love with her. This way, it'll be fairer to yourself, and it'll give her a sense of security knowing that u love her not just for her looks, but for who she is -- both her good and bad points.<br><br>I'll be praying for u!<br><br>God bless,<br><br>-----<br><br>My personal comment? I feel that she thinks being an undergrad is really something. It's not. Get used to it. This is 2001.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ur fwen's so full of self-pity. Why MUST he tell every gal that she is the no.whatever that has REJECTED him? WOW, knowing that 6 gals have rejected a guy REALLie gives one confidence huh~<br><br>Frankly, I find this girl's words fair, and she sounds like a very nice person. Few would bother to even explain why, let alone offer to pray for ur fwen. By this, she will keep ur fwen in her thoughts when she speaks to God, and ask God to Bless him. How Much more can she do for ur fwen?<br><br>All the self-pity oozing out of that lil excerpt was quite depressing and annoying. U know why?<br><br>Cos I know what its like to be unliked, ignored by ur classmates.Ask him if he remembers sitting all alone, day after day in the canteen during recess. I remember. but I choose not to let it affect my behaviour towards others no.Ur fwen isn't the only one to be the outcast.<br><br>I am still not popular, but I hope that I have risen above the stage of whingeing and whining abt how put-upon I feel, how no one likes me and everyone lies to me *blah blah blah* I am still reluctant to stick up for my rights. tho~ we change, but slowly.<br><br>Please tell ur friend that if he doesn't want to be 'nice' (I quote), how will pple hu meet him, LIKE him? The people hu didn't are the PAST, do not place the burdens and anger that one has onto these others. Firstly it is unfair, and secondly, it will engender MORE dislike.<br><br>tell him: Don't just remember the pple hu rejected u, remember the circumstances. Perhaps these pple had someone in mind? perhaps they didn't get along with u? ThERe are so many reasons why. What they said as an excuse, may be THEIR way of Sparing ur  feelings, OR a result of their own tactlessness, or MAYBE even spite.<br><br>And I thought that ur fwen's dig abt the gal thinking that being an undergrad is something. She meant well.She was BEING NICE.<br>(guess I'm not that nice since I'm pointing all these things out <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>SO what if she won't be his girl friend? That does not make her any worse as a person. NEITHER does her refusal diminish Him.<br><br>tell ur fwen to GET UP, start living, to heck with all those pple hu have hurt him. To quote the movie 'Driven', its how fast u get up after life's knocks that count.<br>He doesn't NEED a gf, if he finds one that 'clicks' with him, then well and good, but there are many guys out there hu don't have gfs, and nobody (except those superficial ones) thinks any less of them.<br><br>And w/out a gf (speaking AS a gf), u don't have the hassle of entertaining and spending hard-earned money on her. U don't need to worry abt whether she is going to lose interest in u. there is no pressure on u to always dress and act to please her (in extreme examples). U have freedom. Once with a gf,u lose that. Altho' u do gain some form of companionship, its up to u to judge whether its worth the price.<br><br>Will ur fwen be any happier with a gf? If its becoz he thinks that If he gets a gf, he can prove to all the people hu have 'slighted' him that he is WORTHY? Then I would say he's better off without.<br><br>Let ur fwen read this, and if I have wronged him, I apologise. But this is what I feel.Good luck to him.<br><br>[This message has been edited by aRiaNa (edited 25 May 2001).]</div>

From what you have said, i can see that you have taken your gf for granted already.<br><br><strong>It's true that being a good guy does not pay. It's really true.
