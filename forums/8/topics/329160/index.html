              <p>I was at this pink and gaudy nail shop called <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Enamour Beauty #04-53b at<br>Far East Plaza </span></strong>on Saturday evening around 7+pm and I was served extremely rudely with uneducated ahlians who think they are eloquent and smarter beyond the customers they serve.</p>
              <p>First of all, I asked the salesgirl whether there's a significant difference with the normal nail buffer which is flat and the other one which is white and oblong in shape. After deriving for myself that there really was not much of a difference, I decided to get the white oblong-shaped buffer because I was used to using it anyway.</p>
              <p>But then this idiotic and ****** salesgirl rolls her eyes and keeps on demonstrating how her nail feels different after I tell her that I'm persistent to get the white oblong one. I mean, what the hell is wrong with rejecting what she's trying to sell me when first of all, her persuasion sucks big time and she just doesn't register whatever I'm trying to express to her! In addition to the bad service, the price for that white oblong buffer is overpriced at $6.90 when the price is actually $2 or perhaps even cheaper than that! It wasn't like I was rude and diva-ish to begin with anyway.</p>
              <p>Additionally, there was another ahlian salesgirl who was supposedly serving another customer who happened to walk out of the store despite the salesgirl trying to talk her into buying the product. Can you even believe she had the audacity to say <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">'IT'S A WASTE OF MY TIME'?</span></strong></p>
              <p>Eh, if you wanna be a salesgirl and work in FEP, learn how to accept rejection and customers with attitudes because that's just the way it is! If you think you're so high and mighty and above working as a salesgirl who is at the mercy of customers, then DON'T EVEN BOTHER BEING IN THE SERVICE INDUSTRY! After walking back into the store thinking that she was commenting on how she wasted her time on me, I asked her blatantly and she says<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> 'I was not talking to you. You're too sensitive.'</span></strong> HEY ***** IS THAT THE WAY YOU TALK TO A CUSTOMER? Before walking out of the store I commented loudly in front of other people in the store that she better watch her attitude because nobody is gonna purchase anything else with that kinda attitude. Oh, and this is where it gets better.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">'I don't care. I won't be seeing you anytime soon, anyway'.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Sure honey. With that kinda attitude, I doubt your boss is gonna want you working there any longer because you only induce the customers with your lousy make up skills which are indicated by your thick eyeliner which only makes your eyes completely disappear and your ******* up attitude. PISS OFF.</p>
              <p>There are other countless incidents that reflects the lousy service in Singapore. What the hell is wrong with you if you can't accomplish the basic requirements of being a salesgirl? Would it kill you to bits to smile and be more friendly? There is nothing such as 'I'm having my period, and therefore, I have the right to be insolent and nonchalant to my customers'!</p>
              <p>The government is obviously not paying enough attention to the service attention in Singapore and is trying to get as many tourists in as possible. If there is lacklustre attitude in the service industry with ahlians who can't serve for **** then it's better the government start to close Singapore off from the world and make sure the service sector is improved before it begins to set high hopes for Singapore to be more than what it is today. Ain't nothing more embarrassing than a country that's trying so hard to be at the forefront of everything but doesn't know nothing about basic manners and serving people with a right attitude.</p>

              <p>Hey this is where you got it wrong. The goverment IS doing something about this service problem. I have alot of shops nearby that are operated by china PRCs that provide better service when dealing with customers compared to some of our locals!</p>

              <p>I totally agree with the post sent on Sept '08 by Burnanee. Today I went to this shop not knowing about their horrible service. I went in the shop not intending to buy anything at first, till one "pretty" salesgirl which I do not really know to classify her as an ahlian or not; approached my mum and I about their fake lashes, the glue, the way that they can teach you how to apply with an applicator, with an xtra service of putting it on for you...bla bla blah...(which we already know how to and we can do a better job unlike how they wear theirs-urgh!) and since that "pretty" salesgirl did a good job convincing, my mum and I decided to buy some from them.</p>
