Hmm.. *ponders* actually they not really conmen lar, you dun buy, they also lan lan, cannot force you. But most importantly, the products is wat's important. I heard, they do demos and some form of health survey? The ONLY problem? The stuff too expensive and most people dun want or cannot believe it.

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually the biggest problem with this ASAYO is their business model. I have been there, seen it, heard it and brought it! But whether this product is working is still a mystery!<br><br>I have nothing against these Japanese products! My point is to stand up for justices, when justices must be done. This is the first time I have seen ?health? products been sold in this way. Do you like your friend to keep pushing and shoving their products to you when you don?t even need it? Worst of all, they will try to recruit you into their gang. I have a friend who is a loyal ASAYO employee, but I don?t think he is a friend anymore. Because, his way of selling is really despicable! There is no way I gonna accept his kind of ?hard selling? anymore!<br><br>Honestly, their motive is very clear to me. It is NOT about your health. It is about MONEY! It is about their wealth! Your health is the last place on their mind! Do you think they are doctors? Sorry! They are not doctors, how they know what is good for your health? If you think those people is kind-hearted, you are sadly mistaken. They are masters of psychological and scare tactics. For example: They will tell you: If you don?t buy our products, you will not live for long. They will show you papers and newspaper cutting of how many people died of hearth disease, kidney failure etc. But, why are they so concern about you? Because they want you MONEY! It is as simple as that!<br><br>The most sickening thing is that they like to tell lies, and DAMNED LIES! That is how I became a fool to have brought it in the first place. I am just trying to tell you people to be careful when dealing with ASAYO employees. Be-careful who you trust! If your friend is an ASAYO employee, you better beware! They use your friend; they can use you too!<br><br>If you think their product is good and you like their ?special service?, I have nothing more to say. Good Luck!<br></div>
