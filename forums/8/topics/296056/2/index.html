            <div class='col-md body'>Isn't irony that ger, whom are traditionally the gender that whine and get emo often, are now complaining abt guy starting to be like them? I guess it is the changes in modern society where ger are being treated to a fairer ground with men and it turn out that they too are adapting habit and con that generally come with being a men. Wasnt so far in past where men used to complain women for whining too much that they couldnt bare been in the same room, hence returning to pub instead of home after work? I think everyone hate it when ppl whine regardless of gender. But still, if the society or the government is better, would we still be so stress up that we  need whining to be the outlet?</div>
