            <div class='col-md body'>juz after  7/7 london blasts, there is another bomb blasts by terrorists again..<br><br>LONDON (Reuters) - Up to four bombs hit London's transport system on Thursday, exactly two weeks after more than 50 people were killed in blasts on underground railway trains and a bus.<br>London police chief Ian Blair said: ""We know that we've had four explosions or attempts at explosions. It is still pretty unclear as to what's happened."<br><br>"At the moment, the casualty numbers appear to be very low in the explosions. The bombs appear to be smaller than the last occasion," he added.<br><br>Bomb attacks on three undergound trains and a bus in London killed 56 people, including the four bombers, on July 7.<br><br>Witnesses said they had seen what could have been a would-be bomber running away after dropping a rucksack on one of the trains.<br><br>"We all got off on the platform and the guy just ran and started running up the escalator," one witness who gave her name as Andrea told the BBC.<br>Everyone was screaming for someone to stop him. He ran past me...and he ran out of the station. In fact he left a bag on the train," she said.<br><br>Passengers were evacuated off a bus in Hackney, east London, and police cordoned off streets nearby. The bus company said a blast blew out the windows of the bus but a police officer on the scene said there were no signs of damage.<br><br>A police officer told Reuters: "The bus driver heard a bang at the back of the bus. He thought it was probably a vehicle that had hit him.<br><br>"He stopped at a nearby bus stop and saw a suspect package at the back of the bus."<br><br>The fire brigade put on protective clothing before moving towards the bus.<br><br>Prime Minister Tony Blair called off a press conference with visiting Australian leader John Howard and officials said he would be making a statement later after convening a crisis meeting of emergency officials and ministers.<br><br>The Fire Brigade said Warren Street underground station was evacuated after reports smoke was seen coming out of a train.<br><br>A television reporter at Oval underground station said police had cordoned off the area and brought in sniffer dogs.<br><br>London transport officials said four underground lines had been suspended but overground trains were running as was the Eurostar train to France.<br><br>The British capital was still jittery after the July 7 bomb blasts. They were being marked on Thursday with a memorial service at the scene of the bus explosion.<br></div>
