            <div class='col-md body'>More babies were born in the first half of this year compared to the same period in 2005.<br><br>The Registration of Births and Deaths recorded 18,294 births in the first half of this year, some 300 more than the same period last year.<br><br>The Singapore economy is on an upswing and so are the birth numbers: 37,492 babies were born last year.<br><br>But in the first half of this year, more babies were delivered, compared to the same period last year.<br><br>Not only are there more first-borns, more parents are also having their second, third and fourth child.<br><br>But a population expert tells our reporter that this marginal increase is still not enough to lift Singapore out of its low<br>fertility trap.<br><br>Sociologist Dr Angelique Chan said the increase is marginal and unless more babies are born in the second half of the year, this upswing may well turn out to be a one-off blip.<br><br>Dr Chan said: "I think these figures, while they showed a slight increase, it's too early for us to make any kind of definitive conclusions with regards to the relationship between the Baby Bonus policies and this rise (in) births. We would need data that ranges from about 5 to 10 years to really be able to say we're seeing any increase in Total<br><br>Fertility Rate (TFR) due to A, a Baby Bonus policy. Or B, the economy.<br><br>"The economy is very important here because we just came out of a major recession and what we may be seeing is a slight increase in the number of people saying, yes, I think we're OK now, we're secure enough to have a child."<br><br>So experts feel more drastic moves are needed - such as heavily subsidised babycare services, and longer, more flexible maternity and paternity leave arrangements.<br><br>Dr Chan said: "Looking at France. They provide free childcare. And they do subsidise employers for paid maternity leave. If you really want to make an investment in growing the population, you gonna have to make a monetary investment, among other things. I think we need to go much further in Singapore."<br><br>She noted that Singapore still has some way to go in terms of gender equality in the home and in the work place.<br><br>She said: "We always talk about making it easier for women to combine work and family, but what about men? The men should also be able to combine work and family. And in the new generation of fathers, there're many men out there who don't mind taking a year off of paid leave to look after the baby. Changing maternity leave from the current 3 months to a year is a huge jump. But it's an ideal. And we can move towards it within the next 5 years, as in a long-term target."<br><br>Dr Chan said one way of raising the fertility rate is to have an influx of foreign talents.<br><br>The Singapore Government, she added, may also want to consider allowing dual citizenship, so as to 'naturalise' these foreign talents and their children.<br><br>Another problem contributing to low population growth, is that more women are postponing marriage and parenthood.<br><br>The Singapore resident population grew by just 1.9 percent last year.<br><br>And at a TFR of 1.24 - close to Japan's - Singapore's population is ageing just as rapidly.<br><br>A rate of 2.1, or some 60,000 babies every year are needed for Singaporeans to replace themselves.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maid's day off all very well, but what about other workers who put in very long hours?<br><br>THE article about giving maids compulsory days off ('Compulsory day off in maid new contract'; ST, July 21) set me thinking. I could not help but wonder if the day will come when some union can address the problem of long working hours in Singapore. This is especially true of executives, managers and senior managers.<br>A friend told me she recently worked 24-hour days when there were events in her company. I am sure this is not unheard of. I have also heard of marketing people working way past midnight. I have also heard the lament of accountants who have worked 36 hours continuously. And we have read about doctors who often have no time to visit the loo.<br>What about IT executives who often clock in 100 or more hours a week and are still expected to be on standby 24/7 including weekends and public holidays? Then there are 'after office hours' overseas conference calls that often go one till the wee hours of the morning, leaving people with little and perhaps no sleep.<br>Employers of maids are advised to give them eight hours of sleep every day. How many Singaporean workers have such a luxury every day?<br>On top of long working hours, there is overseas travel to deal with - often at last minute notice. It is not uncommon to hear of workers who are at home only one week in every month.<br>I<strong> have read with wonder that Singaporeans are encouraged to procreate. How can this happen when spouses have such little time to see each other and little or even no time for themselves? </strong><br>Many employers - I am talking about big multinationals here - do not compensate staff with additional days off when they work their weekends away, sometimes for many weekends continuously.<br>When I read articles about work-life balance, I take it with a pinch of salt. I know it will not happen here. Our labour laws protect workers but little - pregnant and non-pregnant ones alike. The onus is up to the employer to search his conscience whether making 'slaves' out of his employees is justifiable.<br>Elizabeth Ng Boon Kwan (Mrs<br><br></div>
