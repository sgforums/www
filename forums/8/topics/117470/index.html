            <div class='col-md body'>Yes thats very true.. old people should be treated with respect..<br><br>One form of disrespect kids nowadays arent clearly showing is to directly show abberant behavior infront of elderly people like cursing, drinking and smoking at reckless abandon..<br><br>Im not a tradition kind of person myself but i sincerely do believe that if you would like to smoke, drink, curse, watch pornography, do it somewhere not within your own house as it spoils the concept of a "home"<br><br>what im going to say next will be unrelated but im going to say it anyway.. flaunting this line "Thanks for giving me a dildo for my birthday" as mentioned by our zombified moderator whose broadband is as complete as her life is sufficiently insulting and turn-off to others users.<br><br>Just as the former story shows, talking big (or more crudely Dau Kang) and talking dirty is obviously disrespectful to our seniors...<br><br>Lets stop this kind of behavior.
