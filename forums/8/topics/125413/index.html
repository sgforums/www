Btw, i believe only a small group of girls can tell between different makes, for eg, a Lancer Evo or Skyline. Most of them just judge by the BRAND.<br>For eg, as every carbuyers know, the prices of BMWs and Mercedes are the SAME, between competing models. But i dont know why all the girls always have the misconception, or view, thus telling me that mercedes are more expensive and have higher status. aint mercedes for ah pehs?<br>anyway, BMW aint called the ultimate driving machine for nothing. the new 5er is so much more responsive then the new e-class</div></blockquote>Wrong assumption.  In fact all ppl want to own a car, female or male. Its a staus symbol<br><br>IF that's the case as you suggested, then all the bus and pbulic transport have only young people but why are there people of all ages in these systems?<br>You made a sweeping statement without knowing the full scale of who you are talking about.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes it will make a difference<br>the same difference it would make when you find out something about a person, and which will help you understand him more.<br><br>is it a family car, did he buy it himself? is he ambitious? is he hardworking?<br>is he a show off materialistic guy to buy something beyond his means?<br>is he sensible, making realistic choices in his own pursuit of his OWN toys and all? Does he have a dream, is he adventurous? Does he like sports cars, landrovers, or status symbols? is he pampered or self reliant?<br><br>but No, the ownership of a car will not make THE difference whether you feel more attracted to the person or not. It is what you learn about the person that make the difference, not the inanimate object. And if he keeps the qualities that makes me feel attracted to him, even if he doesn't keep the car - nope the attraction would not be lesser.<br><br></div>
