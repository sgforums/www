            <div class='col-md body'>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.<br><br>1. Successful indeed are the believers,<br><br>2. Who are humble in their prayers,<br><br>3. And who keep aloof from what is vain,<br><br>4. And who are givers of poor-rate,<br><br>5. And who guard their private parts,<br><br>6. Except before their mates or those whom their right hands<br>possess, for they surely are not blameable,<br><br>7. But whoever seeks to go beyond that, these are they that<br>exceed the limits;<br><br>8. And those who are keepers of their trusts and their<br>covenant,<br><br>9. And those who keep a guard on their prayers;<br><br>10. These are they who are the heirs,<br><br>11. Who shall inherit the Paradise; they shall abide<br>therein.<br><br>12. And certainly We created man of an extract of clay,<br><br>13. Then We made him a small seed in a firm resting-place,<br><br>14. Then We made the seed a clot, then We made the clot a<br>lump of flesh, then We made (in) the lump of flesh bones,<br>then We clothed the bones with flesh, then We caused it to<br>grow into another creation, so blessed be Allah, the best of<br>the creators.<br><br>15. Then after that you will most surely die.<br><br>16. Then surely on the day of resurrection you shall be<br>raised.<br><br>17. And certainly We made above you seven heavens; and never<br>are We heedless of creation.<br><br>18. And We send down water from the cloud according to a<br>measure, then We cause it to settle in the earth, and most<br>surely We are able to carry it away.<br><br>19. Then We cause to grow thereby gardens of palm trees and<br>grapes for you; you have in them many fruits and from them<br>do you eat;<br><br>20. And a tree that grows out of Mount Sinai which produces<br>oil and a condiment for those who eat.<br><br>21. And most surely there is a lesson for you in the cattle:<br>We make you to drink of what is in their bellies, and you<br>have in them many advantages and of them you eat,<br><br>22. And on them and on the ships you are borne.<br><br>23. And certainly We sent Nuh to his people, and he said: O<br>my people! serve Allah, you have no god other than Him; will<br>you not then guard (against evil)?<br><br>24. And the chiefs of those who disbelieved from among his<br>people said: He is nothing but a mortal like yourselves who<br>desires that he may have superiority over you, and if Allah<br>had pleased, He could certainly have sent down angels. We<br>have not heard of this among our fathers of yore:<br><br>25. He is only a madman, so bear with him for a time.<br><br>26. He said: O my Lord! help me against their calling me a<br>liar.<br><br>27. So We revealed to him, saying: Make the ark before Our<br>eyes and (according to) Our revelation; and when Our command<br>is given and the valley overflows, take into it of every<br>kind a pair, two, and your followers, except those among<br>them against whom the word has gone forth, and do not speak<br>to Me in respect of those who are unjust; surely they shall<br>be drowned.<br><br>28. And when you are firmly seated, you and those with you,<br>in the ark, say: All praise is due to Allah who delivered us<br>from the unjust people:<br><br>29. And say: O my Lord! cause me to disembark a blessed<br>alighting, and Thou art the best to cause to alight.<br><br>30. Most surely there are signs in this, and most surely We<br>are ever trying (men).<br><br>31. Then We raised up after them another generation.<br><br>32. So We sent among them an apostle from among them,<br>saying: Serve Allah, you have no god other than Him; will<br>you not then guard (against evil)?<br><br>33. And the chiefs of his people who disbelieved and called<br>the meeting of the hereafter a lie, and whom We had given<br>plenty to enjoy in this world's life, said: This is nothing<br>but a mortal like yourselves, eating of what you eat from<br>and drinking of what you drink.<br><br>34. And if you obey a mortal like yourselves, then most<br>surely you will be losers:<br><br>35. What! does he threaten you that when you are dead and<br>become dust and bones that you shall then be brought forth?<br><br>36. Far, far is that which you are threatened with.<br><br>37. There is n.aught but our life in this world; we die and<br>we live and we shall not be raised again.<br><br>38. He is naught but a man who has forged a lie against<br>Allah, and we are not going to believe in him.<br><br>39. He said: O my Lord! help me against their calling me a<br>liar.<br><br>40. He said: In a little while they will most certainly be<br>repenting.<br><br>41. So the punishment overtook them in justice, and We made<br>them as rubbish; so away with the unjust people.<br><br>42. Then We raised after them other generations.<br><br>43. No people can hasten on their doom nor can they postpone<br>(it).<br><br>44. Then We sent Our apostles one after another; whenever<br>there came to a people their apostle, they called him a<br>liar, so We made some of them follow others and We made them<br>stories; so away with a people who do not believe!<br><br>45. Then We sent Musa and his brother Haroun, with Our<br>communications and a clear authority,<br><br>46. To Firon and his chiefs, but they behaved haughtily and<br>they were an insolent people.<br><br>47. And they said: What! shall we believe in two mortals<br>like ourselves while their people serve us?<br><br>48. So they rejected them and became of those who were<br>destroyed.<br><br>49. And certainly We gave Musa the Book that they may follow<br>a right direction.<br><br>50. And We made the son of Marium and his mother a sign, and<br>We gave them a shelter on a lofty ground having meadows and<br>springs.<br><br>51. O apostles! eat of the good things and do good; surely I<br>know what you do.<br><br>52. And surely this your religion is one religion and I am<br>your Lord, therefore be careful (of your duty) to Me.<br><br>53. But they cut off their religion among themselves into<br>sects, each part rejoicing in that which is with them.<br><br>54. Therefore leave them in their overwhelming ignorance<br>till<br><br>55. Do they think that by what We aid them with of wealth<br>and children,<br><br>56. We are hastening to them of good things? Nay, they do<br>not perceive.<br><br>57. Surely they who from fear of their Lord are cautious,<br><br>58. And those who believe in the communications of their<br>Lord,<br><br>59. And those who do not associate (aught) with their Lord,<br><br>60. And those who give what they give.(in alms) while their<br>hearts are full of fear that to their Lord they must return,<br><br>61. These hasten to good things and they are foremost in<br>(attaining) them.<br><br>62. And We do not lay on any soul a burden except to the<br>extent of its ability, and with Us is a book which speaks<br>the truth, and they shall not be dealt with unjustly.<br><br>63. Nay, their hearts are in overwhelming ignorance with<br>respect to it and they have besides this other deeds which<br>they do.<br><br>64. Until when We overtake those who lead easy lives among<br>them with punishment, lo! they cry for succor.<br><br>65. Cry not for succor this day; surely you shall not be<br>given help from Us.<br><br>66. My communications were indeed recited to you, but you<br>used to turn back on your heels,<br><br>67. In arrogance; talking nonsense about the Quran, and left<br>him like one telling fables by night.<br><br>68. Is it then that they do not ponder over what is said, or<br>is it that there has come to them that which did not come to<br>their fathers of old?<br><br>69. Or is it that they have not recognized their Apostle, so<br>that they deny him?<br><br>70. Or do they say: There is madness in him? Nay! he has<br>brought them the truth, and most of them are averse from the<br>truth.<br><br>71. And should the truth follow their low desires, surely<br>the heavens and the earth and all those who are therein<br>would have perished. Nay! We have brought to them their<br>reminder, but from their reminder they turn aside.<br><br>72. Or is it that you ask them a recompense? But the<br>recompense of your Lord is best, and He is the best of those<br>who provide sustenance.<br><br>73. And most surely you invite them to a right way.<br><br>74. And most surely those who do not believe in the<br>hereafter are deviating from the way.<br><br>75. And if We show mercy to them and remove the distress<br>they have, they would persist in their inordinacy, blindly<br>wandering on.<br><br>76. And already We overtook them with chastisement, but they<br>were not submissive to their Lord, nor do they humble<br>themselves.<br><br>77. Until when We open upon them a door of severe<br>chastisement, lo! they are in despair at it.<br><br>78. And He it is Who made for you the ears and the eyes and<br>the hearts; little is it that you give thanks.<br><br>79. And He it is Who multiplied you in the earth, and to Him<br>you shall be gathered.<br><br>80. And He it is Who gives life and causes death, and (in)<br>His (control) is the alternation of the night and the day;<br>do you not then understand?<br><br>81. Nay, they say the like of what the ancients said:<br><br>82. They say: What! When we are dead and become dust and<br>bones, shall we then be raised?<br><br>83. Certainly we are promised this, and (so were) our<br>fathers aforetime; this is naught but stories of those of<br>old.<br><br>84. Say: Whose is the earth, and whoever is therein, if you<br>know?<br><br>85. They will say: Allah's. Say: Will you not then mind?<br><br>86. Say: Who is the Lord of the seven heavens and the Lord<br>of the mighty dominion?<br><br>87. They will say: (This is) Allah's. Say: Will you not then<br>guard (against evil)?<br><br>88. Say: Who is it in Whose hand is the kingdom of all<br>things and Who gives succor, but against Him Succor is not<br>given, if you do but know?<br><br>89. They will say: (This is) Allah's. Say: From whence are<br>you then deceived?<br><br>90. Nay! We have brought to them the truth, and most surely<br>they are liars.<br><br>91. Never did Allah take to Himself a son, and never was<br>there with him any (other) god-- in that case would each god<br>have certainly taken away what he created, and some of them<br>would certainly have overpowered others; glory be to Allah<br>above what they describe!<br><br>92. The Knower of the unseen and the seen, so may He be<br>exalted above what they associate (with Him).<br><br>93. Say: O my Lord! if Thou shouldst make me see what they<br>are threatened with:<br><br>94. My Lord! then place me not with the unjust.<br><br>95. And most surely We are well able to make you see what We<br>threaten them with.<br><br>96. Repel evil by what is best; We know best what they<br>describe.<br><br>97. And say: O my Lord! I seek refuge in Thee from the evil<br>suggestions of the Shaitans;<br><br>98. And I seek refuge in Thee! O my Lord! from their<br>presence.<br><br>99. Until when death overtakes one of them, he says: Send me<br>back, my Lord, send me back;<br><br>100. Haply I may do good in that which I have left. By no<br>means! it is a (mere) word that he speaks; and before them<br>is a barrier until the day they are raised.<br><br>101. So when the trumpet is blown, there shall be no ties of<br>relationship between them on that day, nor shall they ask of<br>each other.<br><br>102. Then as for him whose good deeds are preponderant,<br>these are the successful.<br><br>103. And as for him whose good deeds are light, these are<br>they who shall have lost their souls, abiding in hell<br><br>104. The fire shall scorch their faces, and they therein<br>shall be in severe affliction.<br><br>105. Were not My communications recited to you? But you used<br>to reject them.<br><br>106. They shall say: O our Lord! our adversity overcame us<br>and we were an erring people:<br><br>107. O our Lord! Take us out of it; then if we return (to<br>evil) surely we shall be unjust.<br><br>108. He shall say: Go away into it and speak nat to Me;<br><br>109. Surely there was a party of My servants who said: O OUI<br>. Lord! we believe, so do Thou forgive us and have mercy on<br>us, and Thou art the best of the Merciful ones.<br><br>110. But you took them for a mockery until they made you<br>forget My remembrance and you used to laugh at them.<br><br>111. Surely I have rewarded them this day because they were<br>patient, that they are the achievers.<br><br>112. He will say: How many years did you tarry in the earth?<br><br>113. They will say: We tarried a day or part of a day, but<br>ask those who keep account.<br><br>114. He will say: You did tarry but a little-- had you but<br>known (it):<br><br>115. What! did you then think that We had created you in<br>vain and that you shall not be returned to Us?<br><br>116. So exalted be Allah, the True King; no god is there but<br>He, the Lord of the honorable dominion.<br><br>117. And whoever invokes with Allah another god-- he has no<br>proof of this-- his reckoning is only with his Lord; surely<br>the unbelievers shall not be successful.<br><br>118. And say: O my Lord! forgive and have mercy, and Thou<br>art the best of the Merciful ones.<br><br>�<br>Chapter 23, Koran</div>
