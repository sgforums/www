              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">I'm due to do NS soon, but lucky me have both an overseas citizenship and a Singapore citizenship. Dual citizenship rocks!</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Let's say if I AWOL/ default/ desert NS after the 1st 2 weeks confinement period of BMT, will the homeland security and borders protection authority sieve me out if I am going to use my overseas citizen passport to travel to Malaysia to transit/ transfer connecting flight back to my overseas country where I belong without getting caught at Malaya?</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">I am not stepping foot to Singapore soil ever again in the rest of my life after my current Exit Permit expiry.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">For my sake, my parents honourably paid a $75,000 NS security bond, their retirement fund. But I heck care my parents' money. It's their retirement money. It is not going to me after they passed away anyway. Apparently, they can only get the money back AFTER I ORD from NS. Good game and smart move, Singaporean government.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">My motherland home country is Canada, the maple country, so I am wasting my time "doing time for this Lion city".</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">I emigrated out of Singapore when I was around 7-8 years old, so I am already pretty liberal for no conscription. </p>

              <p>Those who are liable to serve national service but refuse are
              charged under the Enlistment Act. If convicted, they face three years'
              imprisonment and a fine of S$10,000.</p>
              <p>Controversy arose when the penalties were increased in January
              2006 after <a title="Melvyn Tan" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melvyn_Tan">Melvyn
              Tan</a>, who was born in Singapore, received a fine for defaulting
              on his National Service obligations. Tan left for <a title="London" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London">London</a> to study music during his enlistment age and
              later acquired British nationality. In <a title="Parliament of Singapore" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Singapore">parliament</a>, Defence Minister <a title="Teo Chee Hean" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teo_Chee_Hean">Teo Chee Hean</a> provided some illustration of the
              punishments defaulters would face:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Where the default period exceeds two years but the defaulter is
              young enough to serve his full-time and operationally ready NS
              duties in full, MINDEF will press for a short jail sentence.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Where the defaulter has reached an age when he cannot serve his
              full-time NS in a combat vocation or fulfil his operationally ready
              NS obligations in full, a longer jail sentence to reflect the
              period of NS he has evaded may be appropriate.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Where the defaulter has reached an age when he cannot be called
              up for NS at all, a jail sentence up to the maximum of three years
              may be appropriate.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Each year, a small number of people are convicted for their
              failure to enlist or refusal to be conscripted. Most of them were <a title="Jehovah's Witnesses" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a>, who are usually
              court-martialled and sentenced to three years' imprisonment, but
              they are usually held in a low-security detention facility and
              separated from other conscription offenders. The government does
              not consider <a title="Conscientious objector" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientious_objector">conscientious objection</a> to be a legal reason for
              refusal to serve NS. Since 1972, the publications of Jehovah's
              Witnesses have been outlawed in Singapore. This is commonly misinterpreted to mean
              that Jehovah's Witnesses themselves are outlawed in Singapore.</p>

              <p><strong>Those who require exit permit of 2 years or longer will be required to 
                      furnish a bond. This bonding requirement is similar to the current 
                      arrangement where security in the form of Banker's Guarantee must be 
                      furnished. The amount of the security bond is S$75,000 or 50% of the 
                      combined gross annual income of both parents for the preceding year, 
                      whichever is higher. The monetary bond requirement for male citizens who
                       accompany their parents on overseas employment may be waived and they 
                      be bonded by deed with two sureties.</strong></p>

              <p><span><strong>Why must MINDEF impose exit controls on NS-liable
                  males?</strong><br> <br> Exit controls are necessary to ensure that NS-liable males who have
                  gone overseas to study or reside at a young age return to fulfil
                  their NS responsibilities.<br> <br> <strong>Will young males aged 13 to 16.5 who fail to apply for an
                  exit permit be sentenced to imprisonment?</strong><br> <br> The penalty for exit permit offences of young males aged 13 to 16.5
                  will be a fine of up to $2,000, with no custodial sentences. They
                  will however be subjected to harsher penalties should they continue
                  to breach of the Enlistment Act after age 16.5.<br> <br> Males above 16.5 years who travel and remain overseas without
                  applying for an exit permit would have committed an offence under
                  the Enlistment Act. They will be liable upon conviction to a fine
                  of up to $10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years
                  or both.</span></p>
