            <div class='col-md body'>7 years ago<br><br>P1 to P2 - Study English, Maths and Mother Tongue. Miscellaneous subjects are CME (in Mother Tongue), Health Education, PE (Physical Education) and Art (inclusive of music).<br><br>P3 - Add a Science. From P3 onwards, have to do this I am a young __________ thing. For example, Astronomer, Botanist, etc. Teaches research skills.<br><br>P4 - Add Social Studies + Mr Policeman. Now is Safe &amp; Secure. Also a streaming year.<br><br>P5 &amp; P6 - Dependent on P4 results. EM1 students study an additional subject known as Higher Mother Tongue. EM2 students are the same as P4. EM3 students study the same thing, but take fewer subjects for PSLE.<br><br>P6 is also PSLE year.<br><br>CCA, not sure. For my batch, it's implemented from P3 onwards. From Arts to sports and Science. Uniform groups also have.<br><br>Classroom activities - P1 and P2 are more interactive. Teachers will read out stories to students and students follow suit to learn how to read. Teachers also interact more with students when they are assigned class work, unlike students from P3 onwards.<br><br>As for facilities, classrooms, hall(s), music room, art room (might be optional, not so sure), science room, courts and libraries are present. Other facilities may be there, depends on school.<br><br>What students do after school (for morning session) - play basketball, soccer, captain ball, table tennis, badminton or other stuffs<br><br>What students do before school (for afternoon session) - all of the above.<br><br>A must thing for all students and teachers of the school - singing of National Anthem and taking pledge in the morning for AM session students, in the evening for PM session students. For PM session students, pledge is taken in the afternoon. No pledge is taken in the evening.<br><br>Singing of school song during assembly should be common enough, not sure if it's practised in all schools.<br><br>Exams and tests wise - Term 1 and 3 - CA1 and CA2. Term 2 and 4 - SA1 and SA2.</div>

They generally happen after the exam periods, stressed over poor results. But most didn't result in death. Those that result in death you will see headline after results are announced.<br><br>Was it the O Levels or PSLE, someone killed him/herself over it, after the results were released.</div>

It was so serious that it prompted Tinkle Friend to come over to schools to have talks.<br><br>Police also came. CNB officers also came. To warn against doing illegal stuffs.</div>
