            <div class='col-md body'>ah ma ah if u ONLY wanna learn technical skills and programming ah, no need go school one. this skills are easily self taught. and on net there's alot of places where you can ask for help if you stuck.<br><br>i still remember my 1st day at the informactics programming (HAHAHA) class, the lecturer tok monotone one, somemore so soft, i listen until fallasleep. then later suddenly somebody wake up me, i think lecturer tulan, ask me go up write out the program give him see. i ask simi program, then my classmate show me the question. then i go up and write, but instead of PASCAL i give him C++ code, he just stand there stun a moment, then quickly go alter the code into PASCAL, later he oso dare not ask me go up liaoz  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>actually programming is very simple... basically you're just telling the program to do something. then if u wanna make it interactive, you put in an "if", then it will be "if" this happen, "then" do this action. quite repetitive one lah.<br><br>the only difference between simple n complex programs is that the IF tag got alot more options, this one must ownself figure out one, dun teach in school one. then a few more stuff like, while, loop etc etc. very easy one lah.<br><br>u go those bookstore, get those books "learn C++ in 30 days!", can liaoz. those are sweet and simple. u dun go get those thick thick muchiam encyclopaedia one, those no use, alot of technical jargon, u just need the simple book to understand how programming works.</div>

More often than not, this appropriate move would be, to some extent, contingent upon the circumstances and relevant conditions influencing our attitudes.<br><br>Needless to say, some would point out that a best move is what one perceives. But, from my point of view, there will always be better moves, depending on one's perspective, in terms of time and location.<br><br>Its like buying a computer. There will always be better prices. There is always the possibility that a cheaper computer can be purchased elsewhere or at a later time. Its really a question about when and where u want to buy.</div>
