There is no point in calling the police. The mata would probably come after the fight has ended, then got thru' a series of admin work, and lastly let the case to rot. So, even me, as someone of higher authority than NCOs, won't really consider to call the police. But wat i guess u are saying abt the attitude of NCOs. "Got free show, watch lar" ...<br><br>Ultimately, NCOs are still students, i guess, it would be difficult for them to handle the situation. How in the heck would a 40 yr old gangster listen to a 15/16-yr old kid ??<br><br>Secondly, if u see anyone breaking the law, i will urge u to call the police. If NPCC cadets were seen breaking the law, i think they are breaking the image of the Corps. It is very much similar to if u see a guy from a certainly school behaving in a bad light, he has just tarnish the school image in front u. Such ppl are everywhere, and ultimately, as a CCA, anyone is free to join. The only way is to ask the Unit OC to expel such ppl out. But such a move is very adminstrative, and most OC can't be bothered to do it. So the bad guys stay on ...<br><br>The last note is, NPCC is still a CCA and faces the same problem as every other CCA...</div>
