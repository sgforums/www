Uniform Groups are there for a reason and definitely not what u've said.<br><br>So u call that Police stuff? So does members of Red Cross and Saint John actually wear their Uniform around and provide first aid to those in need? Does members of NCC goes into war for Singapore? Is joining Scouts the only way to have fun and not other CCAs? Is joining BB/GB the only way if u feel holy?<br><br>Please. The purpose of uniform groups is mainly to learn the various aspects and values of the respective Uniform Groups.<br><br><strong>The Boys' Brigade</strong> aims to advance Christ's Kingdom among boys and to promote the habits of obedience, reverence, discipline, self-respect and all that tends towards a true Christian manliness.<br><br>The <strong>Girls' Brigade</strong> aims to help girls become followers of the Lord Jesus Christ and through self control, reverence and a sense of responsibility to find enrichment in life.<br><br>Definitely not to feel holy like wad u suggest.<br><br>The aims of <strong>Singapore Red Cross Youth</strong> are to promote and encourage the participation of youth in the work of Red Cross, inculcate healthy habits of living and develop a sense of social responsibility existing between Red Cross Youth members throughout the world.<br><br><strong>St. John Ambulance Brigade</strong> provides opportunities for members to learn and practice first aid, provide first aid, nursing and ancillary services for the injured and sick and prepare permanent structures during times of peace which may be instantly activated in times of war.<br><br>Definitely not all about First Aid.<br><br>The aim of <strong>Scout </strong>movement is to develop good citizenship among boys and youths through character training.<br><br>Definitely not only for fun.<br><br>The <strong>NCC </strong>aims to enhance the physical and mental capabilities of cadets to develop them into resourceful, resilient and loyal young men and women capable of serving the Republic as responsible adult citizens and to groom leaders for the next millennium.<br><br>Definitely not to have a feel of the army. It's more than that.<br><br>And Finally,<br><br><strong>NPCC</strong>'s comprehensive training programme includes lectures on police related matters, visits and attachments to police establishments. Cadets are also involved in a variety of challenging and meaningful outdoor activities such as adventure training camps. The varied activities, aimed at inculcating in cadets the qualities of self reliance, responsibility, discipline, civic consciousness and respect for law and order, will thus help to develop well-balanced, all rounded, responsible and caring citizens<br><br>Check the link below if u've any doubts:<br><a href="http://www.moe.gov.sg/ccab/uniformed/ugsing.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.moe.gov.sg/ccab/uniformed/ugsing.htm</a><br><br>And also, let me repeat this again. NPCC IS NOT EQUAL TO POLICE.<br>Get ur facts rite.<br><br>U claimed that npcc has ah bengs = facts, not stereotyping. Facts are not views of oneself. If u claimed u have facts, prove it. Dare me? Why should i take the dare? Read carefully man. I said yes, NPCC might have ah bengs but that doesn't make any sense that all other Uniform Groups does not have.<br>*Tsk. Such naive thinking u have.<br>So u say that there should not be even a single ah beng in NPCC rite becos of the image rite? Den wad about NCC?

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by field:</div><div class="quote_body">im in NPCC and i hate it -_-</div></blockquote>Currently, which secondary level are u in now? It may be possible for u to quit in lower sec. U haven't given the reasons for ur dislike, perhaps, it may be easier for us to help if u gave us ur reasons.<br><br>But if u have no choice but to stay on, then i can suggest to u that, do not take the CCA as a chore, because, with that mentality, u will never be able to benefit the soft skills from ur CCA. In many CCA, the absence of one person brings about a large inconvience to the group. Hence, i suggest u to continue ur CCA, with a last resort. That is, think that by going, u will have a nicer CCA report card.<br><br>This will generally applies to almost every CCA.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by skyfoo:</div><div class="quote_body">anw, of all the ug, npcc is the most unmeaningful one.<br><br>while npcc is wearing police uniform, it's not doing police stuffs. sana? crime-prevention? scouts/guides also have. den come do campcraft which i dun think police need that skills. the main duty of police is to maintain law and order. npcc leh? still got ah bengs inside. wtf la. the closest police stuffs they do is perhaps gg lectures and learn theories? lidat may as well scrap npcc.</div></blockquote>Perhaps, someone has such a sentiment like you. The NPCC HQ and Council have worked on some issues already. The NPCC Service Day was lauched several years ago. The aim, was to spread Crime Prevention messages to  residents living near any NPCC Unit. Cadets play a important role in the Service Day, as they are the very ones who spread the information to the residents. With the integration of NCDCC and NPCC into HTCC, NPCC Service Day 2006 saw cadets from NPCC and NCDCC to spread Crime prevention and fire safety to residents.<br><br>NPCC is currently working on a new initiative with some NPCC Units. The initiative is Community Safety and Sercurity Programme (CSSP) bagde. Under the bagde scheme, cadets will have to identify the community needs and conerns and suggest solutions. They will be working with their Neighbourhood Police Centres (NPCs) and Town council to implement their suggestions. A simple example is the installation of grilles along the 2nd floor of some HDB corridors, to prevent balls (flying from the fustal courts) hitting residents or their property.<br><br>The campcrafts skills may seem useless. Are we talking about the soft skills and the hard skills? Even for the hard skills, the saliors are using some of the knots daily. As the soft skills component is a new area that the HQ wants to focus on, it may be some time before the effects are seen.<br><br>The main duty of the SPF is to maintain law and order of the country and safety of the community. While NPCC cannot do the former, the Corps is able to acheive the latter. NPCC is still a CCA, and like any CCA, it will have gangsters, attitude ppl and such. Apart from the prefects (student council) body, the rest of the CCA will have such people. It is inevitable and the suggestion is to request Officers-in-charge (OC) of the Unit to write in to HQ and expel such people from the Corps.<br><br>Lastly, u suggesting to close down the Corps. But do you know that the Corps is the largest Uniformed Youth Organisations (UYO) at 20,000 cadets? Even the tri-service NCC numbers at around 17,000. There must be a reason for it to be so popular within the students. By your reasoning that theories are useless, u may ask MOE to close down JCs as JC students are learning mostly theories ... ...<br><br>Finally, YES, I am from NPCC ...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>whoa, all shooting me. good. I'm a scout btw.<br><br>Firstly, i'll like to clarify for the uniform groups and "what they do". I'm taking the view of a sec 1 kid pondering at the different uniform groups (UGs). And so you tell me, if you're now a sec 1 kid, isn't UGs are like UFOs to you, provided you're not in one during primary school. Ask anyone sec 1 kids who do not have prior knowledge of the different UGs, ask them what they think the different UGs will give them, chances are they will give the same replies as me. Do you all not agree?<br><br>From the observations of my secondary school, the recruitment of students into UGs is mainly by the uniform. A mini survey done by me conclude many sec 1 kids are appealed to the various UGs' uniforms.
