              <p>Hello all,</p>
              <p>need advise. Signup to Spinetrends at Shaw House to treat my ever-probematic lower back. Was treated by a certain Dr Andrew and he was fantastic, felt the results in weeks.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, he quited about a month later. It was quite unfortunate, wanted to bail out and refund, especially when the replacement doctor was "not suitable". But the staff at the 'motherhood' company, Healthtrends, was nice and in they manage to assign another chiropractor to me.</p>
              <p>But low and behold, they inform us that they are now closing the clinic a few weeks ago and I am suppose to go all the way to Parkway (i work and live in CCK and Jurong)!!!</p>
              <p>Though the nice admin people will thus give me a refund becuase of this, but just got a email from them that they will only refund me a few months later and they will only refund less than a quater of the money back. This is Truspa saga happening again.</p>
              <p>Anyone have experience with Spinetrends (aka HealthTrends)? What should i do? Will CASE attend to this?</p>
              <p>TMD :P</p>

              <p>Hey Dilong,</p>
              <p>Its unfortunate you are in this situation.  I kindda heard about it too from some people. I was a patient of Dr Andrew too and luckily i almost completed my care plan when I found out that he had left the company. Thankfully, I found him recently during a promotional event in Orchard recently.  He apparently started his own clinic called Arc of Life Chiropractic at Shaw Centre. He didn't leave Singapore for good and neither did his grandma die...(I thought so)...those were just some of the excuses that the company gave because I think they didn't expect so many of his patients to be so 'connected' to him. And they were worried in case many of his patients follow him... I felt it was bad the way the company treated their doctor and staff. All the old staff one by one also left after that..  I am just glad to have found my chiropractor again. As for refunds, I not sure about this since thankfully I only had a few visits left and I don't mind forfeiting them. Pointless to go if the new doctor/location not to my preference. Plus their attitude...aiyah....cannot tahan... Good luck to you...</p>
