            <div class='col-md body'>My friend's experience...<br><br>My friend knew a girl from IRC and they decided to meet up. Before the meet, he told me that girl always tell him that she's popular amongst the guys and many people are wooing her. She even said there was a guy who actually gave her a diamond ring..<br><br>When my friend reached the meet venue, the girl was late and had not arrived yet. So my friend SMS her to ask where she is. She replied that she's meeting the guy who gave her the diamond ring first, before going over to meet my friend. So my friend was damn furious and sms me to tell me all about these. After some wait, she finally turned up with that guy. And damn, she ain't that good looking afterall and in fact plump and average only, according to what my friend had described. So my friend was like 'WTF' ...still boast so much on IRC....Then he came up with some excuses to leave because everything was not what he expected to be. On his way back, he tried to sms me and described how sucky the girl was like and how crappy she was during the meeting. But....he accidentally sent the SMS to her....only to realise that when the msg was sending halfway. Then my friend panicked liao cos that girl has his ICQ/Contact number/IRC nick etc...He thinks ..this time jialat liao hahaha.<br><br>The girl then called/sms him back asking what he meant in an unfriendly manner i think...heng my friend came up with crap excuse to say that his friend was playing around with his handphone and sent the sms to wrong person.<br><br>So next time, if you want to speak ill of somebody in sms, please double check to make sure that you are sending it to the right person.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>once i wanted to sms a fren about the location of a karaoke room with the message "see you in room xxx on the third floor later" and sent that sms to my then-gf instead. lucky she knows that it was a wrongly delivered sms and i was going to the karaoke. such clandestine-sounding messages can give rise to much misunderstanding. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
