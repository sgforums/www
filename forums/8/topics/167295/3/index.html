            <div class='col-md body'>i think you got brain problem not girl problem becouse you are think thqt you must very very handsome like kimura takuya or hirai ken but actually is you imagine. then you walk on the street and protray your kimura takuya face to people and they will notice you. you will think why she staring at me and you will act handsome and try to shrug people like her because you tink handsome people dont like attention because you liked this attention.so this is actually a brain problem. not your facde problem. then you brain propblem will face another propblem which is your social propblem because you think your takuya face can give you the power to choose girls you like which is wrong as because the real world is that girls not like your face but heart and sometimes brain.so if you got brain and face prpblem most likely you cannot get a girlfriend and scare to go out to walk. and if you are scare to go out and walk and got brain and face problem people will give you sdtrange and funny looks like you noticed but not long enough to find out it is actually your problems not with deprive girls. because deprive girl will not give funny look at people instead. because deprive girl has no brain problem  and they are smart they can make themself look nice and make you give the funny look to them instead and they will act irritate but this is not part of your face and brain problem. thank you</div>
