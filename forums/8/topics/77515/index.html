            <div class='col-md body'>Taken frm TNP webpage<br><br>CHARITY show or Torture Chamber?<br><br>Efforts to raise donations using stars certainly don't have a lot of charity for the celebrities.<br><br>Which, let me clarify immediately, I don't have a problem with.<br><br>My problem with the whole shebang (which, incidentally, is William Hung's next single release) is that it assumes people need to be shocked and stunned before they open their hearts and wallets.<br><br>So what will it take to get more donations? Torture the celebrities more? Although, to be fair, much of the fear factor is stage managed.<br><br>As the executive producer of a local charity show noted, there were safety measures in place.<br><br>Now, that such acts might have worked in the days when Alfred Hitchcock had audiences reeling in fear with the shadow of a knife, some fake blood and creepy music.<br><br>These days, however, we live in a world where audiences are actually being moved by watching a graphic 10-minute flesh-tearing, but passionate, whipping.<br><br>It's undeniable. Just look at the math.<br><br>Pastor Ho Yeow Sun gets 5mm darts shot into her back. Yield from donations: $621,054.<br><br>Jim Caviezel gets the flesh of his back, torso, arms and legs completely ripped out in a 10-minute whipping scene. Box office yield: A gazillion dollars.<br><br>True, churches were responsible for $0.9 gazillion of the takings, but nonetheless I think no-one will pick a fight with you if you boldly state that violence sells.<br><br>Sure, we remember the faces of the celebrities grimacing in pain at charity shows.<br><br>But don't forget many are trained actors.<br><br>But I watched Light Years, so maybe the pain was indeed unbearable.<br><br>Whatever the case, the philanthropic part of me wishes to help, so here's my suggestion.<br><br>Next year, I suggest we up the ante. Instead of 5mm darts, use 50cm arrows.<br><br>And before releasing 50,000 bees on to a star's body, smear it with honey first.<br><br>You get the drift.<br><br>Actually, I'm sure you do because it seems to me, with each passing scar charity show (oops, sorry, I meant star charity show), the stunts become more sadistic.<br><br>Stars abroad also do risky stunts for charities but the element of sadism is somehow missing.<br><br>What does this say about our culture?<br><br>And talking about traits, Singaporeans owe town councils some $24.7 million in service and conservancy charges.<br><br>That's about half the total charges of 14 town councils, but only a third of David Beckham's SMS bills.<br><br>The thing about these charges is that even if you don't pay, the town councils will somehow have to fork out the cash to keep the garbage collectors coming.<br><br>So what happens if Singaporeans all decide to default on their payments?<br><br>Lets send Royston Tan to paste paper on the debtors' doors.<br><br>The paper itself is pending a rating from the Media Development Authority, but seeing it's Royston, it'll be R21, but uncut.<br><br>It's not as though Singaporeans can't afford to pay either, with 75 per cent of those who owe money still buying cars and the latest handphones.<br><br>My last suggestion then, would be to put the people who don't pay in next year's Torture Chamber. Heck, I'd pay a few bucks to watch that.<br></div>
