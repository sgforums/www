Even from now, as of this second. For all you know, i might be dead the next second even while talking here, or you, reading here. Cherish every bit of your life, show your love to your love ones while you are still alive. Before you start to regret when another life was taken away unexpectedly.</div>

"Do you believe that Prayers can heal".. i see that many of u believe that it does..<br><br>Since most of u believe that it can heal..<br><br>Can u ppl pls be kind enough and pray for my friend..?<br><br>Her name is Lin Pei Qi.. she was involved in a road accident on this Monday at Hong Kong.. She's now brain dead.. and if she doesn't wake up by 9pm tonite... she'll be gone.. as the machine is going to cut off as the family couldn't afford to pay the bill.. (S$900 per night for the machine).<br><br>She's only 17 years old. A very kind and understanding girl.. She's really a good person. I dun believe that her life gotta be taken away like that.. She oso had never experience xing fu(dunno wad it is called in english)..<br><br>So i really hope that some kind souls who see this post can help do some prayers for her.. Hopefully she'll wake up by 9pm.. Thanks a million..<br><br>This is all i could do for her now... i really wish some of u will help.. thanks..<br></div></blockquote>If she needs a life support machine to sustain her, most likely, her soul isnt going to return.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks u so much.. It's 1.5hour left.. sighs..<br><br>yah.. there are cases of revivary from brain dead.. i once did a search in the search engine.. but it take years.. i agree it's realli to quick to cut off the supply as it's only 2days after the accident. but realli haf got no choice.. it's really too expensive. Hopefully the RX8 driver can be kind enough to help pay the bill to extend the supply.</div>
