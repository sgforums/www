            <div class='col-md body'>Like mentioned before... it's instinctive to abuse your advantage in any situation.  Sometimes you've got to make a conscious effort to stop &amp; check to see if what you're doing is right or wrong.  People who practice double standards have neglected to practice fair play in a relationship.  Personally I follow the adage - Do to others as you would have them do to you.</div>

If no like, nip in the bud at the beginining, state your intention clear don't lead her on.<br><br>Reason I can think of is lady stand to lose more if a r/s failed cuz they put in more feelings and effort as compared to men. Those ladies who into a r/s due to sympathy or sincerety by the guys will not be the same as I describe cuz deep within their heart, they are still hoping for their the ONE to appear.<br><br>Am I rite ladies?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  An observation from a close to 30 yrs old guy.</div>

Unfortunately, many people seem to have forgotten that.<br><br>Gender equality is fine as long as one remembers its double-edged nature.  Unfortunately, the likes of Greer and company forgot to mention that in making the sweeping change to having the same rules apply to both sexes, the baby got thrown out with the bathwater.  Given the current sociopolitical climate, a woman cannot possibly apply the assumption of infidelity to a man in a manner that she would not do to herself.  Tough luck.</div>
