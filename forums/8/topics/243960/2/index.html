Have you seen how some parents dress their little girls up? They dressed their girls up as if they were going to prostitute their daughters. They think it's pretty, but no, it made their daughters looks like severely underaged tramps.<br><br>I think parents nowadays have 2 mindsets:<br>1) Give children the best.<br>2) Give them what I do not have when I was a kid.<br><br>And sadly enough, some parents, lack maturity, common sense and ultimately, control over these mindsets.<br><br>What results from that are unreasonable parents along with unruly spoilt brats all over Singapore.</div>
