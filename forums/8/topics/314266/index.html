              <p>I have the following problem and would like to ask fellow mates on how you guys solve your problems/issue with Singnet?</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><em>Upon seeing the Agreement For Termination of Service after she got back home from work.

              <p>will go back camp than ask for off than go settle it together with my mom after i take off.</p>
              <p>there are lots of negative sales person that i seen, heard, experience myself..be it direct sales, network marketing sales (more than a handful of such)..telemarketing sales (prudential)...</p>
              <p>it's hard to come by people who are really looking after the interest of the customers from the bottom of the heart, and not in there to put on an act for the commission or for the duty of the job..</p>

              <p>putting oneself in the complainant's shoe, they victimised her mum.</p>
              <p>putting oneself in singtel's shoe, it cud be one of the thousands who attempt to back out of a signed contract. The investigation process wud involve speaking to that customer officer. but honestly having to deal with hundred of customers, who wud remember.</p>
              <p>at the end of the day, it boils down to one thing. we all know our moms well. that is precisely why i never let my own mom deal with such stuff like signing documents ALONE. Myself or any one of our family members MUST be around.</p>
              <p>As much as we wish to empathise with your case. Sorie. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/sad.png" alt="sad.png"> and where got no contact for feedback or complaint....there's a galore of them. you can even go up to their doors and bang it!</p>

              <p>putting oneself in singtel's shoe, it cud be one of the
              thousands who attempt to back out of a signed contract. The
              investigation process wud involve speaking to that customer
              officer. but honestly having to deal with hundred of customers, who
              wud remember.</p>
              <p>at the end of the day, it boils down to one thing. we all know
              our moms well. that is precisely why i never let my own mom deal
              with such stuff like signing documents ALONE. Myself or any one of
              our family members MUST be around.</p>
              <p>As much as we wish to empathise with your case. Sorie. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/sad.png" alt="sad.png"> and where got no contact for feedback or
              complaint....there's a galore of them. you can even go up to their
              doors and bang it!</p>

              <p>thanks for highlighting it, but in case if you notice at my post.</p>
              <p>i mention at line 21 word no 10-12 and line 22 word no 1- <strong>"any ONLINE EMAIL ADDRESS"</strong> for customers to voice their enquires/feedback to..</p>
              <p>the link which you have given, i've already checked it out before i post the thread..it's only giving contact no to call, and not a online address for me to post my feedback onto..</p>
              <p>feedback customer service however should be 24/7 even if it's a automatic response system, it's better than no having any to begin with. Than the staffs can reply back on the next following working day.</p>
              <p>Giving convenience to customers is what GEMS is for and to give Singapore a better Service Quality to make it into First Class but not meant to be misused nonetheless.</p>
              <p>Lots of businesses have online feedback to response to, however if this is one area which they didn't look into or considering the fact that most teenagers and young adults are into IT more than making personal visit to the shop for convenience purpose especially for people who are tight for time.</p>
              <p>It's troublesome when you're working for somebody having little control of time.</p>

              <p>as there's a saying in chinese.</p>
              <p>å¥½äº‹ä¸�å‡ºé—¨ï¼Œ</p>
              <p>å��äº‹ä¼ å�ƒé‡Œã€‚</p>
              <p>I've being working in the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">service industry for 6 years</span> before I stepped into the army..know the <strong>importance of customer service</strong>, thus when it comes to this..i'm actually quite picky..</p>
              <p>looking for loopholes and taking into feedbacks to highlight it for my future biz usage etc..</p>
              <p>if there's something good, customers will tell their own friends, which is what we call customer referral scheme who does it willingly..like ladies calling buddies to go shopping when there's a great discount example Great Singapore Sales/ John Little Mega Sales usually at the Singapore Expo..</p>
              <p>It's not that good things don't spread but rather the degree of how good and if it's beneficial to others than it will spread automatically based on it's usefullness etc..</p>
              <p>Example if telling something to another body like Great Singapore Sales, with huge discounts, a lot of ppl will thus stand to gain. that alone comes with lots of benefits thus it will spread like wild fire..The IT Fair is also another example..using cheap commercial like SMS and newspapers rather then expensive TV Advertisments etc..</p>
              <p>However if there's a good customer service staff, no-matter how good that person is, he/she will not be able to serve all the customers in Singapore. Moreover not a lot of people will go to just that branch which the excellent service staff is located at.</p>
              <p>Customers go for conveninece at the end of the day.</p>
              <p>Example back then when I was in working in the restaurant..Offering good service does have it's own benefits, just being recognised by a few polite customers only. They will give tips to staff whom they are happy only and do it discreetly and not by giving to the restaurants as it's being shared among the restaurants and full-timers followed by part-timers..<br>Which is unfair as in the service industry..seniority counts in those small business organizations..I've being inside it..seen it..experienced it..so I know..</p>
              <p>It pays to be good, but it never pays to be super good else you will be taken advantage of..</p>
              <p>However, telling a complaint on the other hand will highlight the weakness of the individual and highlight what is lacking in the service training thus the company will improve their training and take note of it and try their best not to do it again else bad reputation will be tagged along with the company/retailer if the problem continues..</p>
              <p>Although I might be complaining, but I complain knowing my stand..unlike majority of the others who complain without thinking..nor putting themselves in other people's shoes..</p>
              <p>I at the end of the day..still look up to people who have good service and will sometimes comment them etc..</p>

              <p>thanks..</p>
              <p>which reminds me of my first computer which we bought from SIM LIM Square..</p>
              <p>back in 2002..</p>
              <p>But only years later..when i learnt how to assemble, dismantle computer than opened my computer to see the components..</p>
              <p>Finding out that we were cheated by at least a  hundred bucks ++ as we were supposed to get a 40GB hardisk but only to see a 4GB hardisk inside..which was so f***ed up..and pissed off..</p>
              <p>Next time anybody want to buy parts and form a new desktop, never ever ask the salesperson at the shop there to give advice..else they will take advantage of people who are not savy in IT..</p>
              <p>NEVER EVER TELL SALESPERSON YOU DON'T KNOW A THING ABOUT IT ELSE YOU WILL END UP PAYING MORE FOR LESS VALUABLE STUFF!..</p>
              <p>It just makes me boil when I got reminded of such irresponsible salespeople and poorly trained customer service agents..</p>

              <p>nonetheless thanks..</p>
              <p>it's email is only directed for the following 3 and not for Mio Related.</p>
              <p>They have Mio FAQs, but i wonder why they didn't delicate email add to specifically cater for Mio since it's currently the highest no of customers in Local Market for Singnet. My Singtel on the other hand is dropping drastically as more are converting to Mio. Such is what I read from newspapers some months back.</p>
              <p>I'll try and give it a shot. Thanks for your help :)</p>
