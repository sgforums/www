In making statements that "Only" when one believe in Christ then a person can go to heaven - is implying other people are going to hell? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Its subtle but hearing it once too often... the deeper implication comes out<br><br>To me its hard to find true spirituality and I often found it in the oddest of places. I've never found it in temples or churches anymore.  I looks at the rich temples and the monks who drive cars and go shopping. Or the pastors who have a few millions in their bank accounts investing in funds and such. Then I see that poor person on the road who struggles to make a little money trying to sell something or the old picking up drink cans. I wonder what the so call religious groups  are doing all this time when they so happily ask for donations<br><br></div>
