I can accept that the members are STRONGLY ENCOURAGED to give, but no coercion should be involved.<br><br>This is already against the purpose of tithing liao. Don't think Rev. Kong's theology can deviate so far.<br><br>If there is any coercion from CGL .. better complain to the church authorities. mai tu liao. but if it is just her own "wishful thinking" that she has to donate 10%, then she better change this mentality.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One has to be discerning when handling religions.<br><br>For example, if a certain religion tells you to strap fertilizers and blow up buildings full of infidels, perhaps you might be better off not joining. If the religious leaders blatantly asks for money and he uses the church to launder money to avoid paying taxes, you might want to consider other alternatives.<br><br>I'm not saying that my religion is the best or that it is the true one. Its merely best for me. Try to join a religion that teaches you good values.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What can I say about it all...I think there are alot of CHCMCs out there. CHCMCs=City Harvest Church's Misguided Children. I'm totally against people who go all out trying to convert people. hell,i even kena before, some teens, stop me to do survey along Orchard Road, ask for name,contact etc. Then before the week is over, call me to try convert,jio me go their church. Hmmz,mebbe CHC is on a commission scheme...for every person a devotee converts, he/she gets to take a step towards heaven. Just like insurance, perhaps they even have a Million Convert Round table,where those who convert a million people or help to the church attain a million dollars in donations will be allowed to clear *God's Customs* faster, as the Immigration officer is none other then dear Pastor Kong.<br><br>Also, contributions should all be voluntary...not enforced. I may not donate to a church, but then I mow the lawn around the church, attend to the plants, or even keep the church spick and span, so because I never donate and scarifice the 10% I have,doom to hell i go? Well, if so...then honestly...I would love to have more Christians in my platoon when I go for long exercises,all I have to do is go up to each and ask for 10% of their food,and promise them that god loves them as his own children and that they are on the fast track to heaven and they will willingly part with their 10% of food which they have carried all the way on their backs from the campgates?<br><br>The reality is this, teens are at an age where they are highly impressionable. Peer pressure, influence and wanting to be the "in" group and a "in" person cause them to make the wrong judgements. Also, a herd instinct of following the direction which the general crowd is headed as they deem that its the right path, will sooner or later cause problems as they are unable to think for themselves. Only the herd leaders can think, and the followers just follow blindly without any form of thinking for themselves,allowing them to be manipulated by those at the reins of the herd.<br><br>Imagine this scenario, one day the govt. links CHC to having accquired funds illegally and steps in to intervene, seizing church property and freezing all the cash assets the church holds, with police guarding the premises so as none of the church-goers are permitted entry, I won't be surprised to see them demostrating outside the church and go head to head with riot police and all. Why? Because they are following what they perceived is RIGHT! And not what the law deems RIGHT!</div>
