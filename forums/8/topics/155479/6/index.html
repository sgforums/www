            <div class='col-md body'>wow didnt expect this thread to be hot property but it just goes:<br><br><blockquote><br>Friend jioed me there once, and right...I'm horrified to realise something. I just stood at the corner, and view their ceremony and all. something hit me, some of these kids, have parents who are the older gen, taoist/buddhist type of parents. And they actually fight,argue with their parents so as to go to church, but in church, the pastor,someone who has no blood relations with them, asks them to praise the lord and so on, they so willingly praise,so willingly shed tears and so on. I'm horrifed why? Because parents who slog their asses off so that we kids can haf a good life and education and so on, gets thanked by being shouted,yelled and fought by the very ones they are protecting. And the kids can actually listen with total obedience to someone whom they have no blood relations with? How is this possible?<br></blockquote>ye thats really a pathetic story but its not uncommon. there are some farknuts out there who actually attempt (and yes, try very hard) to convert their peers though their parents actually dislike their own children to convert.<br><br>so what has this kinda religion that converts every one cheapen to? a sheer 'fad' item? a peer pressure thing?<br><br>i personally know a few chc people who (omfarkinggawd) dont even know that they are PROTESTANTS.<br><br>so whats chc about? a peer pressure thing to plunge into? like smoking? just that the smoke is more holy, and perhaps more permanent?<br><br><blockquote>okay, for once i will agree with bout au revoir. The church is NOT a place for one to flaunt his/her body. A church goer should dress in a way that he/she would not distract others in the congregation.<br><br>Being a christian, and having lots of youth friends, the one thing we discourage the youths from doing is arguing or quarrelling with their parents to go to church. Conflict does not resolve the situation. Instead, we encourage them to excel in their studies and reflect a sincere change in attitude towards their parents.<br><br>As for this thing abt CHC, lets not spread anymore rumors. This entire "friend of mine got hooked up " thing has been circulating so long. Not healthy to spread rumor. =D Like rumors of aliens landing in ang moh kio... have u heard??</blockquote>my dear friend, we're NOT targetting christians. We're just targetting the dysfunctional styles of chc and their mindless clones.<br><br>lets put ur theory this way, like those lame pamphlets telling others to "OMG YO BLARDER JOIN OUR SUNDAY HEALING PRAYER SERVICE, CONFIRM + 100% GOT HEALING POWER ONE. CAN CURE VAGINAL AND BREAST CANCER, HEMOPHILIA AND ALSO AIDS. CAN ALSO MAKE U FLY!" exaggerated, but im totally pissed off by these kinda crap advertisments left outside my door. goddamit... now the question is: do you believe in it?[/quote]</div>

How come i nv see other religions advertiste n ask "promoter" to "promote" n sell their religion??<br><br>N one thing u ought to know their population got so many christian as they r ang moh country so how to compare to a multi racial n religion country like us??</div></blockquote>Can someone post the statistics? Actually American is a melting pot and I believe their % of Christians is not as high as we imagine. They are more multi racial and multi-religious than us leh .. they have wiccans we have or not?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Preaching, or more correctly evangelism, is a "commandment" by Christ. Other religions have diff beliefs and advertising and promoting is not mandatory.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes really sian of christian stunt..<br>Ok, not all christian are like tt, but mostly. Its not the religion that sux.. its the ppl. They often deliver the belief wrongly.. when they themselves do not fully understand whats written on the bible. Usually christian who approach ppl for preaching, they only know a few lines from the bible. Nxt time if u try flipping thru their bible n anyhow ask them other lines.. most likely they cant explain well.<br><br>I got a fren who was a buddhist. She was first attracted to CHC cuz of this good-looking guy. So slowly she goes to the mass &amp; gathering.. etc. As expected she converted to christian shortly after that. At the same time, she got a bf, who she said is very nice to her. Reason of breakup?? Guy dun wan convert christian, she cant be with a non-christian bf. WTF?!<br><br>In life, a gd bf/gf may only pass by once.. becuz of religion, she gave up that guy. Not that the religion rule is wrong.. but cannot follow blindly de mah? So being with a non-christian.. and then? And then what? Then u cant go heaven huh? U believe in God ah, ur partner respect God too but jus dun wan convert only. Like tt christian also must set the rule till so die die?<br><br>I often ask my christian fren abt the rule they got to follow. When i ask why n why n why, they cant convince me with their ans. In the end, they jus say "jus follow loh.."<br><br>What is this??</div>
