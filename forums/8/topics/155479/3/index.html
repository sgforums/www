I just stood at the corner, and view their ceremony and all. something hit me, some of these kids, have parents who are the older gen, taoist/buddhist type of parents. And they actually fight,argue with their parents so as to go to church, but in church, the pastor,someone who has no blood relations with them, asks them to praise the lord and so on, they so willingly praise,so willingly shed tears and so on. I'm horrifed why? Because parents who slog their asses off so that we kids can haf a good life and education and so on, gets thanked by being shouted,yelled and fought by the very ones they are protecting. And the kids can actually listen with total obedience to someone whom they have no blood relations with? How is this possible?<br><br>Perhaps society has manipulated the younger gen. to be like little sheeps, who are easily misguided and lack the ability to judge right from wrong, and think with our own minds instead of being influenced by peer pressure?Its really really shocking, as they follow without question. I observe this as an 18 year old  free-thinker born to a buddhist family. I visit places of worship by other religions too, and honestly,other churches do not follow such practices and so on. The majority at CHC, are really teens and youngsters.Guy friends of mine from Poly and previously in sec.sch, told me before that they are converting and so on, mainly coz they feel that alot of gurls attend churches and such. But seriously, ask them and i can tell u, 9 outta 10, are just teens seeking a place to identify with, an identity to identify with.<br><br>Thats hw i really feel...if your reason for going to a place of worship is to socialise...mite as well go clubbing or join some fun activites...seriously.</div></blockquote>my friend, i will say this, in Christian teaching, filial piety(or however it is freaking spell) is a core teaching, obviously, this kids, argue with their parents on weather they can go to church or not because their friends freaking can go and they cannot go, so on and so forth.<br><br>over what you say about people praising, please lah, which song leader just stand on stage with a freaking wooden face, and goes, lets flip to song number 112, and start singing? and i really feel that you have not seen a more positive image of a church yet, CHC is just a church, lead buy a pretty shallow pastor i say(base on his teachings). do try covenant EFC, you would see the positive side of things<br><br>and lastly, i feel that human does have the rights to choose whatever religion they want to, its a basic right, i would say providing a person with all his needs still do not give you the authority over his or her religion and beliefs<br><br>lastly, yeah, CHC girls does dress like they wanna go clubbing or what, buay tahan, bad image sia</div>
