            <div class='col-md body'>just share a website I have found which describe the characteristic of a cult. He got 100 characterisitic form of thingy and I just find it interesting. I just paste the more interesting characteristics<br><br><a href="http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-cult_q0.html#cq_guru_right" rel="nofollow">http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-cult_q0.html#cq_guru_right</a><br><br><strong>1. The guru is always right</strong><br><br>The Guru, his church, and his teachings are always right, and above criticism, and beyond reproach.<br><br>In some cults, the guru is dead, but the principle is the same. I use the word "guru" loosely here; in many cults the charismatic leader has the title of minister, priest, yogi, swami, prophet, or all-knowing wise man. Or even, "Chairman Mao." In any case, the leader is always right.<br><br>Likewise, the teachings of the guru are always right, and when he dies, his writings become holy scriptures, infallible and unquestionable. And the guru's church is always right, and the guru's successors are always right, and everything about the cult is always right.<br><br>The degree to which the cult glorifies the leader is often absurd. L. Ron Hubbard, the leader of Scientology, was lauded as the most magnificent person who had ever lived -- indeed, he was single-handedly the greatest cause of human advancement in all time, because he had been reborn in lifetime after lifetime, returning to Earth again and again, each time bringing yet another great discovery or advancement to humanity. It seemed that L. Ron Hubbard had been, in successive reincarnations, most all of the greatest and most famous men who had ever lived, throughout all of human history.<br><br>Not to be outdone, Moon's Unification Church claims that Sun Myung Moon and his wife are "The Perfect Parents," the only two perfect people on the planet Earth. And Moon is the new Messiah, here to finish the work that Jesus Christ didn't quite manage to get done right...<br><br>It just goes on and on. In cult after cult, the leader is just the greatest thing. "Ultimately you cannot admire the guru, you must worship him."<br><br>If you have any doubts about whether the cult worships the guru, just ask a member, "What are the 10 biggest mistakes that the guru made in setting up the organization and formulating its doctrines?" True believers will give you a look of horror and insist that the guru has never made any mistakes... "The very idea is unthinkable."<br><br>There is one big disadvantage for the guru when the cult declares that he is perfect -- he has to act that way, and at least do a good job of faking it. If he is found to be stealing all of the money and screwing all of the girls, it can hurt his believability. A few cults have a clever work-around that spares the cult leader from having to be perfect: Somebody Else, like a dead saint, or an angel, or Jesus, or the Virgin Mary, is the perfect one, and the cult leader merely "channels" the Perfect Master's messages. In that way, what the leader says is still unquestionably true and unchallengeable, because it comes from a Higher Power, but the cult leader can indulge in all of the pleasures of the flesh himself without creating a contradiction. After all, he never said that he was perfect, or any more holy than anybody else. He is just more attuned to the Higher Spheres, and able to hear the Voice of a Higher Power...<br><br>Oh, and of course the received messages will suit the leader's whims. Suppose, for instance, that there is a cute young woman whom the leader fancies, but she has gotten involved with another male member of the group. Well, suddenly the Angel or Ascended Master is criticizing that other fellow for indulging in base desires, and telling him to knock it off and have nothing to do with women. Then, when the cult leader jumps on the same young woman, the Ascended Master has no criticism of him... Funny how that works. You can use your own imagination to dream up another dozen similar tricks.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>2. You are always wrong</strong><br><br>The individual members of the cult are told that they are inherently small, weak, stupid, ignorant, and sinful, and are in no way qualified to judge the Guru or his church. Should you disagree with the leader or his cult about anything, see Cult Rule Number One.<br><br>This cult characteristic is sometimes expressed in the infantization of the cult members: They refer to the leader as "Father", while he refers to them as "my children."<br><br>A corollary to this rule is the practice of lowering members' self-esteem by a variety of methods:<br><br>Elders or higher-ranking members will berate the newer members and tell them that their work or their spirituality isn't good enough. Again, the beginners are abused by the guru and his henchmen until they reach the inner circle, at which time they can turn around and do it all to someone else.<br>It is almost a universal cult characteristic that, in the opinion of the cult leader and other elders, newcomers cannot think correctly. They are too "new", or "unspiritual", and they haven't been members long enough, or they haven't prayed or chanted or meditated enough, or they haven't been off of drugs and alcohol long enough, or something...<br>Members will criticize themselves and confess all of their sins and faults, sometimes engaging in public self-criticism or confession sessions. This is used by everybody from Maoist Chinese Communist groups to Christian cults.<br>Sometimes other members will attack them and criticize them in "group therapy" sessions, or Synanon games.<br><br>Members are taught not to trust their own minds or their own judgement:<br>Your thinking has been corrupted by sin.<br>Your judgement is no good.<br>Your thinking is no good.<br>Your mind is no good.<br>You have a criminal mind.<br>You have an alcoholic mind.<br>You need a complete make-over.<br>Your thinking is controlled by your addictions.<br>Your thinking is controlled by your sexual desires.<br>Your thinking is controlled by Satan.<br>You haven't been chanting or meditating or doing yoga long enough to have a clear head.<br>You haven't been off of drugs and alcohol long enough to have a clear head.<br>Members are taught not to trust their own motives:<br>Your motives are no good; everything you do is just for yourself.<br>You are selfish, vain, egotistical, self-seeking, and always trying to get your own way.<br>You are just seeking ego-gratification.<br>You are lazy.<br>You are always trying to do things the easier, softer way.<br>You just want to get laid.<br>You just want to get drunk or high.<br>You just want to avoid the hard work of getting right with God.<br>You just want to be happy.<br>Members are taught not to feel their own feelings.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>3. No exit</strong><br><br>There is simply no proper or honorable way to leave the cult. Period. To leave is to fail, to die, to be defeated by evil. To leave is to invite divine retribution.<br><br>Members are often taught that all kinds of bad things will happen to them if they leave: They will lose all of the spiritual progress that they made while they were in the cult, or they won't be able to get into Heaven, or the Devil or demons will get them, or they will relapse and die of drugs and alcohol... That is another standard cult characteristic: The Cult Implants Phobias, and more of the usual threats and fears are listed under that item.<br><br>Obviously, if everybody leaves the cult, then the phony guru's game is over. So he is the one who really has reason to fear people leaving.<br><br>There are often tremendous obstacles to leaving:<br><br>There is usually some form of peer pressure, where loyal cult members will work 'round the clock on any member who has doubts about the cult and longs for his or her old life. (The other cult members don't want to get left behind, and splitters shake their own "faith".)<br>The obstacles may be physical ones, like where the cult lives communally in an isolated area, and the cult won't give the member a ride back to "the evil other world".<br>Often, the cult has taken control of all of the members' checkbooks and credit cards, and the member is literally pennyless and will have great difficulty getting out.<br>In extreme cases, like in Rev. Jim Jones' People's Temple, they even shot those who tried to leave.<br><br>The Scientology "Code of Honor" includes these items:<br><br>2. Never withdraw allegiance once granted.<br>3. Never desert a group to which you owe your support.<br>And Scientologists who are members of the "Sea Org" (sea-going organization) sign a billion-year contract, swearing to serve the cult leader L. Ron Hubbard in all future reincarnations for the next billion years. How's that for not ever leaving the group?<br><br>A corollary to the "No Exit" rule is the demonization of those who leave:<br><br>They are evil, weak, and selfish.<br>They are stupid and foolish.<br>They are wandering in darkness, unable to see.<br>They are traitors, quitters, turn-coats, disloyal, deserters.<br>They have sold out.<br>They are Enemies of the Cross.<br>They have chosen Evil over Goodness.<br>They are losers, trying to throw stones at winners.<br>They didn't chant enough, or they didn't meditate enough, or they didn't do enough yoga.<br>They weren't really trying.<br>They didn't follow the procedures correctly.<br>They were unable to resist the temptation to sin.<br>They hid their problems, and didn't reveal them to the group.<br>They couldn't overcome their cravings for sex, alcohol, or drugs.<br>They couldn't give up their attachments to money and possessions.<br>They couldn't be honest.<br>They were always stupid, real losers.<br>They never could get it right.<br>They are the spawn of Satan.<br>They were always trying to destroy our movement.<br>We are much better off without their bad influences.<br><br>In some cults, members are told to absolutely avoid any contact with people who have left the cult. They are told that the departees are evil and dangerous, and must be shunned and ostracized. Good Scientologists may not have any contact with people who have been "declared Suppressive Persons." Jehovah's Witnesses may not talk to or associate with those who have been "disfellowshipped." Likewise, good Moonies may not communicate in any way with those who have left. That is an act of self-preservation for the cult: They don't want to risk their members being told some sensible things by people who were lucky enough to get out.<br><br>Such ostracism also acts as a strong deterrent to people who may be thinking about leaving. Cardigan, in "Mainstream Cults," makes the point that the fact that every member of the cult knows for certain what will happen if they leave is a potent psychological threat. It goes beyond a vague, remote, "you'll burn in Hell for eternity" threat. It's an immediate, here-and-now threat: "We will not associate with you ever again. You will be completely cut off and totally alone." No one wants to risk being completely ostracized by his or her friends. And since most cult members associate almost exclusively with just other cult members, such ostracism means being cast completely adrift, and left totally friendless and alone.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>5 Cult Speak</strong><br><br>The cult has its own language. The cult invents new terminology or euphemisms for many things. The cult may also redefine many common words to mean something quite different. Cult-speak is also called "bombastic redefinition of the familiar", or "loading the language".<br><br>"Loaded Language" is one of Robert J. Lifton's Eight Conditions of Thought Reform -- an essential part of any effective brainwashing program. The cult-speak may include a bunch of well-worn slogans, which Lifton called "thought-terminating clichÃ©s. The special words constrict rather than expand human understanding, and the slogans stop thought.<br><br>Beginners have to learn all of the new terminology in order to fit in, and understand what is being said. Then, the new language has the effect of separating the newcomer from his old world, and from his old circle of friends. His new cult friends will tell him that "Only another cult member understands", and it will be true. When he babbles nothing but cult-speak, nobody but another cult member will be able to understand.<br><br>Back in the "real world", because leaving the cult is one of the worst crimes that a member can commit (according to the cult), most cults have a special term for leaving, like "going tai-tan", "backsliding", "leaving the fold", being "lost in maya", being "trapped in samsara", "straying from the path", "falling from grace" or simply "going out". When that dreaded phrase is uttered, everyone knows what it means.<br><br>Sometimes euphemisms or redefined phrases can take on truly evil dimensions. Adolf Hitler's "special handling" of the Jews, and sending them to the "final solution", are classic examples. And this one is really gruesome: the poison gas Zyklon B, with which millions of Jews were killed, was called "material for the resettlement of Jews".<br><br>Likewise, Mao Tse Tung sent his enemies and critics to slave labor on remote farms for "re-education" so that they would learn to "blossom properly".<br><br>When Rev. Jim Jones gave the order to murder the 276 children at the Jonestown People's Temple commune, he didn't say, "Kill those kids" or "Give them the cyanide." He asked, "Would someone help those children in crossing over?"<br><br>There are plenty of contemporary examples of loading the language, or bombastically redefining words:<br><br>In many cults, "You must have faith" really means, "You must believe what I'm saying."<br><br>"The Lord will reward you" really means, "I'm not going to pay you."<br><br>In one cult, "Sharing the love of God" means practicing prostitution to get money for the cult, and "Allowing God to bless others" means cheating people out of money which then goes to the cult.<br><br>In David Berg's "Children of God" cult, "FF" means "Flirty Fishing", which means women members practice prostitution to get more money and new male members for the cult.2<br><br>Likewise, in The Children of God, "forsaking all and following the Lord" means giving all of your worldly wealth, including your house, to the church, and then obeying the orders of David Berg,3 which often includes the women practicing prostitution, and their husbands pimping them on the streets, to get the cult more money.<br><br>And David Berg redefined "true spiritual freedom" and "perfect love" to mean that all of the women in the Children of God cult, even his own daughter, should freely have sex with him.4<br><br>To the Moonies, "heavenly deception" means misleading, deceiving, and lying to nonmembers to promote the church's goals.<br><br>Scientologists are actually supposed to read Scientology literature with the Scientology dictionary in hand. Any time they read something that they do not understand, or disagree with, they are supposed to look up the words in the Scientology dictionary to get their new official meanings. Thus, the members allow Scientology to redefine the whole language, and actually, to redefine reality.<br><br>In Scientology, "EOC" -- "End Of Cycle" -- is church jargon for suicide. Scientologists have actually been sent out as assassins, with orders to kill critics of Scientology and then EOC after the target was terminated.6<br>Another aspect of loading the language is constant redefinition or reinterpretation of anything and everything, whenever it is convenient. For instance, you may be reading the teachings of a phony guru, and find errors and logical inconsistencies in his teachings, and point it out to members. The true-believer cult members will answer, "Oh, you don't understand. What it really means is..." And then they will explain and reinterpret the guru's words until he sounds like a genius who deserves the Nobel Peace Prize. Eventually, it seems like everything means something else, and nothing is as it appears...<br><br>Another twist on that constant redefinition game is that some groups let words have two very different definitions, simultaneously. Which definition will be used at any given time depends on the circumstances. Thus, the very same sentence can have different meanings at different times. This is especially true of cults that hide the truth from newcomers. An innocent-sounding saying may have an entirely different meaning after you learn the real meanings of the words.<br><br></div>
