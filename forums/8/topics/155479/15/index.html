He asked 'why are you a buddhist?'. I just said, 'maybe cos i've been following my parents and that i'm comfortable with my religion lor'.<br><br>then he said 'you should have more free will in yourself and shouldnt follow blindly with your parents like that, do you think you are happy being a buddhist?'<br><br>i was like 'wtf? whether or not i happy at least i wasnt forced into it.'<br><br>he ended the evening with these last words 'I think buddhist is the worshipping of devils.'<br><br>I stopped my meal, gave him the longer middle fingers, which err my middle finger could extend that day and greeted him off with an 'FU!'<br><br>I never heard from him since.. but it's really one of my most terrified experiences ever... I was being respesctful and friendly, and just because i dont make friends by judging what religion they believe in, he took it as an opening to convince me... i tot he would give up when i refused so many times, but still he's like a huge rock, not bulging man..<br><br>i think it's a minority for people like him to behave, but i believe these people are doing the wrond thing.

If you know how much she have in her bank accounts, the money donated is only peanuts.. She can spend several thousands on her shop, the money donated not much lah..<br><br>They get the members to pray for her and hoped that she'll do well in her singing career, with the support of her fans in church, she'll suceed.

Why Christians share gospel with pple? simply to let pple know God loves them... Whether want to accept it, it's really up to individual. In bible, Jesus never force pple to accept Him.<br><br>Of course there bound to be christians who do it in the wrong way. Anyway, motive is to do out of love, not out of pressure to hit goal...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>two kinds of BGR? boy-god relationship and boy-girl relationship...<br><br>anyway i have gd friends from chc, i didn't think they are all about bgr... few are really good.. BUT i do realise there is an ounce of truth in the fact that there are ppl there actually looking for gals.. this church is large, there are boys and gals, surely it's inevitable that at least a few are interested in each other.</div>
