They'll encourage every member to buy. Her first album is sold in church, they got 'bundle sale' 5cd cost $70+. They 'encourage' everyone to buy 5cd and give to friends/family (thats how the 'free cd' thing come about). Even now, though less promotion in church but they'll keep updating members how well her song is doing in billboard. I joined her fan club, they got an outing and i wasn't informed. So, where did the ppl come from?<br><br>The super bad thing that happen to me that year was, i was in bible school. I know what's going on and what happened.<br>{Did some editing, scared later kena sue. Those who 'quote' pls change also. Just delete the 2 sentences. Thanks.}<br>Its like an 'automatic' thing for the members to buy her album, support her concert/appearance etc. When she start out she's already 30 and this year will be 35. For the pop scene now, she's considered lucky.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>CHC aside, dunno whether enyone of you every encountered this not.. but here goes...<br><br>When I was in my year two poly, i was invited to attend a church function somewhere around somerset yputh park there... forgot the name le about 4 yrs ago liao... initially i was just giving face to my friend cos we been friend for long time liao mah.. then introduce me to some of her friends lor.. then just so happened that one of her friends also study in the same poly as me.. i just 'ying xiu ying xiu ' lor... who knows he go and take my number from my friend sia... who is not even in the same poly as me...<br><br>at first it was okie, he just asked me to join him for dinner and stuff every time.. then i went along lor.. as the time flew by, he started asking me what my religion was.. to which i replied, 'i'm registered as a buddhist in my IC'. then he invited me to go along with him to church again, to which i decline politely bah...<br><br>then after a few more times, i just felt like bashing him up. the very last time he tried to convince me actually made me feel very disgusted with him. He asked 'why are you a buddhist?'. I just said, 'maybe cos i've been following my parents and that i'm comfortable with my religion lor'.<br><br>then he said 'you should have more free will in yourself and shouldnt follow blindly with your parents like that, do you think you are happy being a buddhist?'<br><br>i was like 'wtf? whether or not i happy at least i wasnt forced into it.'<br><br>he ended the evening with these last words 'I think buddhist is the worshipping of devils.'<br><br>I stopped my meal, gave him the longer middle fingers, which err my middle finger could extend that day and greeted him off with an 'FU!'<br><br>I never heard from him since.. but it's really one of my most terrified experiences ever... I was being respesctful and friendly, and just because i dont make friends by judging what religion they believe in, he took it as an opening to convince me... i tot he would give up when i refused so many times, but still he's like a huge rock, not bulging man..<br><br>i think it's a minority for people like him to behave, but i believe these people are doing the wrond thing. I still remembered people standing buy my poly's overheard bridge asking people to join them for church hahaha....</div>

Laughing<br><br>Well, u can very well tell ur uncle straight in his face that u hav been 'brainwashed'. Thou i normally stand on the fence, but for CHC cases, i just can't. I feel that their 'preaching' is a totally bias education to the believers, and getting them to 'donate' $$$ on 'construction' &amp; 'maintenance' fees...<br><br>I feel that when they say 'a christian can only be with a christian', they r only tryin to cover up their motives. It seems to me tat the ppl managin CHC are tryin to put a 'barrier' around their believers, so tat dey wun be influenced by deir boy/girl-frenz to leave their 'system of education'.<br><br>Of course, no offence to anyone from CHC here. Juz voicin out my opinion here.</div>

They'll encourage every member to buy. Her first album is sold in church, they got 'bundle sale' 5cd cost $70+. They 'encourage' everyone to buy 5cd and give to friends/family (thats how the 'free cd' thing come about). Even now, though less promotion in church but they'll keep updating members how well her song is doing in billboard. I joined her fan club, they got an outing and i wasn't informed. So, where did the ppl come from?<br><br>The super bad thing that happen to me that year was, i was in bible school. I know what's going on and what happened. Its like an 'automatic' thing for the members to buy her album, support her concert/appearance etc. When she start out she's already 30 and this year will be 35. For the pop scene now, she's considered lucky.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> </div></blockquote>If that's really true, then it's just another area where City Harvest has failed as a church. Really sad.</div>
