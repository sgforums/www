            <div class='col-md body'>CHC, to my personal opinion works like a MLM organisation.<br>Sometimes i really do wonder if they get paid by "forcing" us to go attend their session.<br><br>I believe church is a place for common to worship and to show his belief in God himself.<br>Maybe somehow, somewhere, the idea or the real teaching of God have been "misguided".<br>I believe, if we ourselves believes in God, it makes little difference if we go Church or not.<br>Nor does it makes any difference if we are donating or not.<br><br>What we have, is to answer to ourselves, have we been doing anything bad that is against the teaching of God?<br>It makes no point to keep mentioning God, God, God when you yourselves does not follow the teaching.<br>Church is again a place where like-minded people gathers to worship God, and seriously, i think it'll be the same if you<br>worship him in your heart anywhere.<br><br>I'm not a Christian in any sort, but i do respect some people who keep their heart open to opinions, yet does not sways his idea of God's teaching<br>, instead of those people who hurl at people whom attacks their religion. Cultivation brings up a person, if your action mis-match the<br>teaching, why do you still attend Church? Likewise, sincere people who really follows God teaching deserves to be appulased.<br>We can choose not to follow them, but we cannot hurl at them. Each opinions of matter varies.</div>

Its not the religion that sux.. its the ppl. They often deliver the belief wrongly.. when they themselves do not fully understand whats written on the bible. Usually christian who approach ppl for preaching, they only know a few lines from the bible. Nxt time if u try flipping thru their bible n anyhow ask them other lines.. most likely they cant explain well.<br><br>I got a fren who was a buddhist. She was first attracted to CHC cuz of this good-looking guy. So slowly she goes to the mass &amp; gathering.. etc. As expected she converted to christian shortly after that. At the same time, she got a bf, who she said is very nice to her. Reason of breakup?? Guy dun wan convert christian, she cant be with a non-christian bf. WTF?!<br><br>In life, a gd bf/gf may only pass by once.. becuz of religion, she gave up that guy. Not that the religion rule is wrong.. but cannot follow blindly de mah? So being with a non-christian.. and then? And then what? Then u cant go heaven huh? U believe in God ah, ur partner respect God too but jus dun wan convert only. Like tt christian also must set the rule till so die die?<br><br>I often ask my christian fren abt the rule they got to follow. When i ask why n why n why, they cant convince me with their ans. In the end, they jus say "jus follow loh.."<br><br>What is this?? </div></blockquote>This is sad.

I know the good &amp; serious christians has put up alot of effort on missionary just like Mother Theresa. But then again if i continue to be christian it would only clash &amp; upset my parents who are devout buddhist. After my study with Buddhism for 2 freaking years. I've understood the meaning of benevolance &amp; the 8 unfold paths that set me to prioritise my life. The Dhmma has touched me better than the lord (CHC version).<br><br>Cheers  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
