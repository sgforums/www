            <div class='col-md body'>not exactly retro. When I say it, I refer strictly to disco music produced in Italy, by Italian composers and artists. However, most people tend use it in broader terms to describe the dance music produced in Europe during the mid 80s.<br><br>Bear with me guys. this might be boring. but this is this the kind of music that has been stuck in my mind for years and i just can't get over it or firgure out why it is so unloved.<br><br>In order to further explore the origin of Italo-Disco "...we have to go back to the end of the seventies, when DISCO in general was popular, even in the beginning of the eighties. The REAL DISCO-made-in-Italy following the meaning of the word, came from people like Fred Jacques Petrus ("Peter Jacques"), with his fellowmen responsible for so many productions for Little Macho Music (Goody Music, Speed, Renaissance, ....) It sounded more like the American disco-productions, but always with that special "melody"-touch, for which Italians are the champs.<br><br>There is no shortage of opinions explaining why this musical genre remained in obscurity. Some "conspiracy theorists" believe that the USA and Canadian record companies and media resisted it and eventually "killed" it. I would like to explore a little deeper the "rise and demise" of Italian Disco music. the similar monotonous synthetic electronic sound (new at the time), coupled with uninspiring, subdued, soul less robot-like vocal performances could bored you to death after 45 minutes or so, most 'Italo Disco' records experienced a quick club death never to be heard or spun again...<br><br>Italo-Disco is all about percussion... Those over-arrangements and melancholy style of the ROLAND JX-8, Yamaha DX and JUNO synths, and sounds created by Minimoog, Oberheim, Linndrums, Emulator II (all the instruments commonly used by Italians in the early 80's) created something very unique and special in disco music history. Europe never experienced "disco sucks" phenomenon and disco (or, call it as you like it) was at the top of it popularity. Most FM radios used to have disco-dance oriented airplay, and the music (mostly mainstream) was well known by everyone. That was the time when many Italian Dee Jays began to experiment with keyboards and synths (playing keyboards slowly with just one finger and then elevating the speed with computers) and many young musicians made some "easy money" with low cost &amp; fast consuming products.<br><br>The classic Italo sound... is done only by keyboards. The rhythm section is totally electronic and there are no strings at all. The voice is used only as an instrument, in order to complete the melody. Nobody cared about the lyrics! The english was poor but that was not a problem. Many Dee Jays turned singers couldn't really sing and speak English at all, so it was not an unusual practice to manipulate the voice by computers with overdubs etc.<br><br>As it happened to Disco music, the Italo-Disco is experiencing the renaissance these days, more than twenty years after it's original debut. All that passion is for the love of music, not money. It seems to me that Italo never died, it is alive and well only in the hearts of the devoted fans.<br><br>for a sample of what i'm talking about, click below....<br><br><a href="http://www.ld-sign.com/italo/soundbites.php?style=Italo-Disco" rel="nofollow">Listen and Believe</a></div>
