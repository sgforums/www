            <div class='col-md body'>Being beautiful doesn't mean life is a bed of roses.<br><br>I have a friend whose elder sister is like, really really good looking. But life is kinda like an agony for them, since they have to bear with things like sexual harrassments from their male colleagues and superiors almost everyday.<br><br>The situation would get kinda outta hand eventually, so they're forced to change jobs. From what I know, she's already changed job 4 times already due to such harrassments.<br><br>Then there's the matter of the boyfriend. The guy is good looking too, but unfortunately, he suffers from an anxiety complex, since HE feels that he's not good looking enough, and is really really insecure. (Weird, I know.) Then couple that with the fact that he's widely chased after....<br><br>Well..... temptations exist I guess.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if this is a discussion on the possession of beauty making life easier instead of happily ever after with the opposite sex, i totally agree.<br><br>if given a choice between being really gorgeous and being an average looker or an ugly person, there's no contest at all. i will choose being gorgeous. why? for the simple reason that people are generally more predisposed to people who are beautiful, they're treated with more respect (don't ask me why, i don't know, they just seem to command more respect), more politeness is also bestowed on them and just watch them charm the pants off the sales people. of course there're those who are reverse snobs who wouldn't give the beautiful people the time of the day but those are few and far between. and even if they do behave a little badly, they're usually forgiven in a jiffy, try doing that if you're an ugly toad and see how long it takes for others to be talking terms to you again.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>but generally i find that treating others with courtesy and respect first works most of the time in making life easy for both parties, regardless whether both are beautiful in looks or not.<br><br></div>
