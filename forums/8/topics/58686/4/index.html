            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="large"><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Girl to boyfriend: If you love me, obey my 77 RULES </strong></span></span></span><br><br>HOW about this for a love story: She wrote a list of 77 rules he has to follow.<br><br>When he broke one, she refused to see him for a month.<br><br>He hasn't been allowed in her house since last DecemÃ‚Â�ber, but spends six hours a day sitting in the corridor talking to his lady love through the bars of the gate.<br><br>At mealtimes, he eats outÃ‚Â�side while she stays inside to join her mother at the table.<br><br>Not many men would put up with such treatment.<br><br>But Mr Wong Ying Sheng does - because he's hopeÃ‚Â�lessly devoted to his girl-<br>friend, Miss Koh Xing Xia.<br><br>And Miss Koh has written all these rules because she's afraid of losing him.<br><br>"I set those rules because I'm afraid he will look for other girls," said Miss Koh, 19.<br><br>Mr Wong, 18, carries the rules with him everywhere he goes. He told The New PaÃ‚Â�per on Sunday that he doesn't mind them and folÃ‚Â�lows them strictly.<br><br>"I love Xing Xia very much and I live for her. I'll agree to anything that she asks for, and I've no problem with any of the rules that she has set."<br><br>Mr Wong added that his girlfriend set the rules three years ago when they met.<br><br>NO TALKING<br><br>But even though Mr Wong repeatedly professed his love for Miss Koh, he still broke the rules.<br><br>"I broke rule 5, 7 and 10," said Mr Wong who has meÃ‚Â�morised them all by heart.<br><br>Rule 5 states that he is not allowed to bring another girl to his home except Miss Koh.<br><br>In rule 7 and 10, Mr Wong is not allowed to hold hands, hug or kiss another girl and not to sleep with other girls.<br><br>But on Aug 22, Mr Wong took a feÃ‚Â�male friend home and allowed her to stay overnight.<br><br>"It was late and she wanted to stay over so my mother agreed. Both of us slept in the living room," he said.<br><br>"We didn't have sex. We just kissed," he insisted.<br><br>So why did he break the rules and kiss the girl?<br><br>"She was very beautiful. I forgot about Xing Xia for a moment.<br><br>"I was rash and I regret what I did. I only love Xing Xia and no one else."<br><br>He decided to confess to his girlfriend, and after hearÃ‚Â�ing his confession, she was heartbroken.<br><br>She refused to see him or answer his phone calls for more than a month.<br><br>But he visited her flat in Yishun every day, taking over an hour by bus from his home in Bedok South.<br><br>"At first when Xing Xia was really angry with me for breaking the rules, she reÃ‚Â�fused to see me and wouldn't even talk to me at the gate. Her mother would close the main wooden door and I was very upset," recalled Mr Wong.<br><br>He often hammered on the door and screamed outside the flat, and his behaviour annoyed the neighbours.<br><br>On a few occasions, the poÃ‚Â�lice were called in.<br><br>"I explained to the police officers that I didn't harm anybody and I stayed outside the flat because I wanted to show my girlfriend that I love her very much," said Mr Wong.<br><br>"The police let me off with warnÃ‚Â�ings."<br><br>One neighÃ‚Â�bour, houseÃ‚Â�wife Anna IsÃ‚Â�mail, 43, said: "He would scream sudÃ‚Â�denly or talk very loudly at the corridor. My baby has never been able to have a good and peaceful nap ever since he came."<br><br>She recalled an incident when Mr Wong climbed onto the parapet and threatened to kill himself.<br><br>"The police came and perÃ‚Â�suaded him to come down," she said.<br><br>Another neighbour, MadÃ‚Â�am Jiang, 54, said: "WhenevÃ‚Â�er he gets too noisy, I'll just close the main door. I don't want to provoke him."<br><br>But Mr Wong said that now things have improved, and sometimes Miss Koh will come to the gate and chat with him for hours.<br><br>He brings soft toys and food to coax his girlfriend during each visit.<br><br>The couple met in school three years ago. It was love at first sight.<br><br>"We were studying in the same school in Tiong Bahru. I would take the MRT with her back to Yishun before I went home to Bedok every day," said Mr Wong.<br><br>PARENTS AWARE<br><br>"Our parents were aware of us dating and did not have any objections to our relaÃ‚Â�tionship. Sometimes we would stay over at each othÃ‚Â�er's home."<br><br>After the couple stopped school last year, Mr Wong started visiting Miss Koh at her flat every day - even though he isn't allowed inÃ‚Â�side.<br><br>"When Xing Xia's brother passed away last December, her mother refused to let me enter the flat.<br><br>"She told me that it was Chinese superstition that I can't enter their flat when someone in the family died. My mother also doesn't like me to go to Xing Xia's house," said Mr Wong.<br><br>"But my mother soon gave in to me as I'm her only son and she dotes on me.<br><br>"She knows that I love my girlfriend very much and want to see her every day."<br><br>SIX HOURS DAILY<br><br>Mr Wong reaches Miss Koh's flat at about 2 o'clock in the afternoon and spends up to six hours with her.<br><br>When The New Paper visÃ‚Â�ited the flat last Tuesday, the couple were chatting at the gate, with Miss Koh inside the flat and Mr Wong on the floor outside.<br><br>Occasionally, Miss Koh would hand a drink to Mr Wong through the gate.<br><br>"She would also pass me lunch and dinner through the gate," said Mr Wong.<br><br>"But she doesn't eat with me, she eats with her mother in the kitchen.<br><br>"Because her brother is gone, she needs to keep her mother company."<br><br>Mr Wong added that since he is currently jobless, he wants to spend all his free time with his girlfriend.<br><br>TOUCHED HER HEART<br><br>His devotion has touched Miss Koh's heart.<br><br>"I've decided to forgive him and give him another chance," she said.<br><br>But the second chance came with more rules.<br><br>"I'm setting those rules beÃ‚Â�cause I love him very much and I'm afraid of losing him," said Miss Koh who has also set a curfew for Mr Wong to be home by 10pm every day.<br><br>"I wish I could stay longer, but in order to be home by 10pm, I need to leave at 8pm.<br><br>"I will faithfully obey her rules," said Mr Wong.<br><br>***<br><br>adapted from <a href="http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/top/story/0,4136,37425,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/top/story/0,4136,37425,00.html?</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>obviously, both of them can't think properly...and from the grammar and spelling mistakes made by the 19 yr old girl, one can tell she's not very educated...and that 18 yr old guy, who should be in poly or ITE, is currently jobless...not a very bright kid either, if you ask me...<br><br>and, that guy shouldn't be given another chance...i mean, look at him, he broke the one rule which, i think, is the most important rule amongst all couples, whether or not it's written down in black and white...if he can't obey this rule, he can forget about the other 76 rules...<br></div>
