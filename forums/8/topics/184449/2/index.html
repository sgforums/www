If choice is given to me I would rather meet up for dinner have beer in the restaurt then off to home, things isn't as sweet as it looks.<br><br>I admit sooner or later I do have to settle down, find someone to start but I also must consider the fact that education in everywhere is expensive (I hope to have my children in Singapore School).<br><br>I believe that you do have a family and how much does it take for you to survive on the pay that you have? I am not discriminating you, you should know that SGD$5k is just enough for a HDB and a normal 1.6 saloon car.<br><br>Worse I only have a N level cert, I tried to get into MNC they reject on the spot. That is the only path that do not need entertainment.<br><br>My job DO SUCK BIG TIME, I agree that is why I have another incoming. That incoming also require me to travel, traveling to Europe, Asia and USA even my new job does not spare me.<br><br>Mr Li Kar Shing (richest man in HK) also face lots of entertainment, he is rich enough to find employee to drink on his behalf. All that employee happens to me moi, business man knows they have health, lanauage and status problem that is why in China most of Singaporeans are not used to the sales ethics.<br><br>I am afraid very afraid that my job will eat into me, into my family and into all that matters to me. I know 99.9% will reject that is why alot of people have to choose, choose between their career or their family.<br><br>I left my family back in Singapore, I am very sad at that point of time (very close knit family). I choose to enhance my career instead of falling behind my peers, all these have sacifices to make and they are not free.<br><br>Yes I am tired but so are my peers (1 of my 17 years close friend is here in China too, live next to my block different company), but no one would want to admit to going back. Peer pressure you would say, people always tells me when under pressure people will grow I look older than my age now.<br><br>Too tired to do anything now, juggling between familes is tiring and I do not want to give up wither side or even compromise each side (be it now or later).</div>
