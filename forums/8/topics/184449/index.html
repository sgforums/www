            <div class='col-md body'><br>Newbie to SgForums, think I was involved with an ugly argument today which concludes to something that I would like to share with you.<br><br>Girlfriend,<br>What we will be like with them,<br>What will we like without them?<br><br>Please do not get me wrong I am a grown up adult nearing 30, I feel horrible today so thinking of penning it down.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">True Story </span><br><br>This is my goal since I was 16, I admitted I was a ugly chap then gals saw me as a very good friend this broke my heart. During the whole of that time I indulge in food, so much that I weight a good 150kg.<br><br>Things were just not looking my way, I was called up for NS and all small hope of GFs are bashed. The day I was enlisted I saw many of my peers with GF sending them off, I was of course jealous course I admitted I was only fat but I still ok why I am deprived of a GF?<br><br>During the parents visiting day I was again very depressed because I long for a GF, this I made up my mind that I would change.<br><br>I train very hard during my NS and yes I drop to a good healthy level of 75kg (I stand at 1.92m), slim and tall with lots of lean meat. I was an appeal to most ladies during that time, had lots of flings then I met her.....<br><br>She was not very beautiful at first sight, she is innocent and I admitted my first intention is to cheat her.<br><br>Things begin and I was getting more and more fond of her, and then came back the part of fling. I lost her a total of 2 times for 3 years together, all of these 2 times is my fault which I cannot blame anyone.<br><br>I move to China in the hope of forgetting this horrible sin that I have created  to start another new me then I met another mate of my life (that is 6 months after the mouring), yes she is a Chinese (someone told me never to trust a Chinese). I have been thinking a lot of things people tell me, telling me how blissful is marriage life, how nice it is to have children and how nice it is to renovate the house to your own liking.<br><br>I yearn for a good family since age of 25, I have been out in the field for more than 14 years. I have tried almost every guyÂ’s weirdest fantasy, but none can satisfy me anymore I yearn for a quiet life.<br><br>I realized I have to start something, most of my peers or pals have settled down got their flat (every time I went back to Singapore they would invite me to show off their trophy to me) and their children have grown.<br><br>I started planning for a marriage with my current GF of 2 years, I admit I spend every cent I earn and did not even save any money for the whole of my life. I started saving and within months I managed to save up SGD$10k (yes expiates do earn that kind of figure overseas), but I needed more time more time to prepare to built my master piece.<br><br>The figure the everything that I dream of is coming, then came the crush of my life. My GF of 2 years finally told me that she does not like my job, my job does require me to go for entertainment and traveling is part of my job but seriously I am no longer interested in commercial sex or anything to do with that kind of thing.<br><br>She does not like guys in Sales, I have explained that I am not educated and I need all these to survive and to crave out my career path.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What we will be like with them? </span><br><br>Of course telling my truth story has a part because these parts are something that I have gone through, just bear with me for a while.<br><br>If you are not career minded, then having a family is not a problem because they will not hinder your ways to get successful. I am a highly paid sales man and my job is to sell and entertain, since this is the case I have my job to consider too.<br><br>It is the truth that some men have the utmost support of women when they got married but most of them did not have a choice anymore, if they do not strive out they will stand to be jobless.<br><br>So is it hindering or left with no choice? I leave it to the audience to believe and think for them.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What will we be without them? </span><br><br>I believe that without women (not that I do not like them anymore) my life will be more carefree, I can concentrate more on my job, I can do more with my time (learn golfing, fishing and riding) and get to know more friends of different gender.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Q: I will be lonely at times.</span><br>A: Yes but that time will be short consider the things you will be learning.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Q: I have my needs.</span><br>A: There is such a thing as paid sex.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Q: I want to settle down.</span><br>A: Can but do you want to suffer endless quarrel because of money? I know I am prepared to get shot by a lot of females out here but I stand my ground, MONEY is the root to all evils. Also who is going to help pay for that 4-room house? The renovation? The Electricity bill? The Phone bill? The grocery bill? The furniture? Etc, Etc, Etc......<br><br>I am now driven by decision and does she not understand? I have to face so much probelm with my factory people going to war everyday and she has to pick a quarrel with me over my job?<br><br>All of my cheonging kakis know that I have change so much, I do not ogoole at girls, I do not seen interested the least bit in beautiful ladies beside my future wife and lastly I did not even try anything funny for 2 years with her.<br><br>She already knows that I know the feeling of pain already so is there a need to?<br><br>Any ladies here to give suggestions?<br><br>With warmest regards,<br>Oak</div>

I have very strong belief on relationship and always believe in trusting each other till the end, seems like a lot of these are fantasy.<br><br>I tried to break off for a few times but all these time I am getting nowhere, I have a tough decision to make always. Things are not too smooth in my job now and I am changing to another one next week but the distance is like Jurong to changi in Singapore, I will also need to camp in in the factory to revamp the structure. After hearing this she don agree anymore with the changing of my job, she told me too far blar blar blar...<br><br>I need to really think of something out fast otherwise this is going to get out of hand soon. That is why I need to hear the ladies view on this story, what they felt and how they felt if their boyfriend or future hubby is like that.<br><br></div></blockquote>If you really have to break off with her, then do it. She doesn't sound like one who is really concerned about you. Changing of jobs is very common in this kind of economy.<br><br>Well, if you can't bear to leave her, both of you have to reach a compromise somewhere. Meet out, have a good talk with her.</div>
