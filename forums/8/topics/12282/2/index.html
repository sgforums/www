Yes, we can be complacent, apathetic and feel satisfy that we live in such a stable clean place with the government making all the call.<br><br>However, the government had made it very clear, they want foreign talent more than local pple since company like siemen etc prefer to employ the cheaper and more talented foreigner since they have the right, the government will support them by granting easy PR to these pple.

The foreigner are cheap and talented with lots of academic decoration while average singaporean are considered expensive and stupid. Retrenchment or more accurately replacement will be next thing that most singaporean fear if they continue their life in this forsaken island. Just look around your environment, you will see more and more foreigner's face. Try feeling complacent somemore when you got retrenched like me while your foreigner or PR counterpart still retained their job.<br><br>you can try asking the PR or the foreigner what so good about taking up singaporean citizenship?? And then maybe you will find the answer why singaporean want to leave and migrate to other country. Maybe the only thing that singaporean feel wanted and proud of in singapore is because they are the only one who will serve in NS to protect the country for some pathetic pay so as to make singapore a safe place to live in. For who, you guess.</div></blockquote>Poor thing...? Rather too straightfoward I guess...? Hope I'm not wrong... But this IDEA of the government has something to do with natural selection, ecology and 'filtering'... Together with the idea of GLOBALISATION... Currently I see TWO POSSIBLE plans that the government might be taking... One is NATURALLY BAD and INCONSIDERATE as MOST of the people in here would believe or be thinking of I guess...?<br><br>The OTHER... Is an 'ADVANCED THEORY'.... For SURVIVAL of Singapore's FUTURE... And I TRULY HOPE the government's heading for that direction..... And I FEEL... It's HIGHLY likely that it's so... According to current trend... YES.... The GOVERNMENT could've made LIFE BETTER for alot of people out there..... This IDEA roll me back into the PAST... And I KNOW... ALOT of people would tell me that the PAST is the PAST (The PAST should make way for the future CRAPs... Which I kinda AGREE in the past myself...?  :p) But if our ANCESTORs were thinking of the SAME THING... We won't be the SINGAPOREANs we are today... Never mind being MPs who are scolded at times (how about MOST of the time for a change..?), their WILL is DETERMINED... Though I have to admit that I do see them making 'flaws' every now and then... But as a human who don't? And with the kinda POWER and CONTROL they have I'm SORRY to admit at times people could be TEMPTED... Or evenly WRONG most of the times.... But put YOU up in that position and I reckon you could be doing ALMOST the same thing...<br>At times we really can't blame them for not giving in to OUR REQUESTs... Like for example why don't MPs cut their salary..? I can see myself just a few weeks ago still STRONGLY agree on this topic... But think about their POSITION as REPRESENTATIONs of SINGAPOREANs... The IMAGE that they have to PROJECT to the others... LOWERING themselves indirectly LOWERS the status of SINGAPORE... And giving in to Singaporeans too easily would SLACK DISCIPLINE and CONTROL over it... Those who have RAISE a child before should understand what I mean... On the other hand, you can also think of these as ONLY EXCUSES... I'm not saying you ARE wrong... You COULD be WRONG... I COULD be WRONG...? It's ALL up to your BELIEF...?<br>AND..... PLEASE don't always have this FIRM BELIEF that SINGAPORE's NOT attacked because of SAF ALONE... The FACT that there're SO MANY FOREIGNERs out here walking around here are like 'shields' scattered and casted around us... No doubt some could cause trouble, but I can ASSURE you that SINGAPOREANs is pretty much capable of doing the SAME... That's why the GOVERNMENT is SELECTIVE in their INTAKE....<br>And INTAKE, GLOBALISATION and SURVIVAL... PERSONALLY I think GLOBALISATION is a MUST... Just depends on how it's being carried out...? If you look at SINGAPORE in the PAST and what it is NOW.... And IF you look at SINGAPORE and the other countries... You'll be GLAD that the government is ALWAYS so KIASU like a TOPICAL SINGAPOREAN... Putting up so much DISCIPLINE on its PEOPLE and COUNTRY... And not only trying to pick up and pack things back in place after it's already MESSY enough....<br>And our SLOWLY RECOGNISED status...? How many people can actually afford a MAID at home in SINGAPORE YEARS back...? How many still working and suffering though others enjoy life..? CLASS DIFFERENCE is ALMOST inevitable in EVERY COUNTRY.... At least we can bring our heads up now as we walk among the 'many people' that is slowly living among us on this island... Of course still A LONG WAY to go compared to the more ESTABLISHED countries... Now Singaporeans have so commonly so many type of maids at home... But how often do you hear a Singaporean working as a maid in other country...? Hmm..? Go think about some of the things I've mentioned if you care to...?

Just understand there're usually AT LEAST 2 ways to things.....?<br><br></div></blockquote>Mind if i know your status??? Singaporean citizens, PR or foreigner??? Working in the army or GLC?? Owning big houses with a few maids or are you owning just a HDB flat with lots of Debt?? Do you represent the majority of the singaporean?? Do you agree that most singaporean are living on debt with car loan, housing loan etc??<br><br>So you think that SINGAPORE's NOT attacked not because of SAF ALONE... but The FACT that there're SO MANY FOREIGNERs out here walking around here are like 'shields' scattered and casted around us? Do you think these scattered 'shields' around you will still stay when singapore is at war?<br><br>Is having a 3rd world country maid at home and not singaporean's maid is a measure of how singaporean is doing now compared to the past? Do you think that all those household having maid are true local singaporeans? Would your kids after graduating from the local university be able to grab a job among the competition from all the foreigner scholar? Would your kids be able to survive in the future on his own, secure his job, own a house car and maid if he/she just attained a simple local degree to compete with the foreigner now??<br><br>Well, i not sure how would the answer to the above question would varies. But for myself, facing the fact, it's mostly negative to the core. Firstly, i'm a retrenched father with 3 mouths (a wife and 2 kids) to feed at home (bullshit to the 3 kids policy), a 5-room HDB flat loan waiting for me to pay off. All would be fine if there's a job to settle the ever piling bills. but given the current market situation, not even to say for an old retrenched manager, even the young singaporean graduate from local university are having a hard time finding a jobs. All this unemployment happening and yet you can still see foreigner getting their PR status coming in singapore to work, retaining their job with their decorated cert. Do you think there's still future for average local graduate now compared to the last time if this replacement keep going on?? How much cert decoration should your kid obtain and how much longer before he can step out to the real world to work and how much more educational expenses you need to put it and is it worthwhile at the end? Should you ask yourself all these if you are a responsible parent?<br></div>
