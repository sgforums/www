              <p>Singapore scrapped the estate duty so that the rich can preserve their weath to the next generation.</p>
              <p><span>A big plus for wealth management </span></p>
              <p>Sat, Feb 16, 2008<br>The Business Times<br><br>THE scrapping of the estate or death duty comes as no surprise. It is yet one more flourish in a series of moves designed to boost Singapore's attractiveness as a wealth management centre - and it is long overdue. Financial advisers and Singaporeans alike will heave a collective sigh of relief.<br><br>For wealth management, the scorecard looks good: No capital gains tax. No tax on interest and investment income, and on foreign sourced income. And now no estate duty.<br><br>In the past few years, individuals and lawyers have written columns on why estate duty should be abolished. One of the most convincing was by lawyer Goh Kok Yeow, published in The Business Times in 2002. Mr Goh, who advises on estate matters, called estate duty an 'anachronism and unfair form of taxation', from which the amount of collection was tiny.<br><br>Based on the inland Revenue Authority of Singapore's annual report for FY2006/07, the number of cases assessed for estate duty has remained fairly steady at more than 1,300.<br><br>Collections, as Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam said in his Budget speech, averaged $70 million through the years. This would be less than half a per cent of the total tax collection of $22.8 billion in 2006/07.<br><br>The move should be a plus for the wealth management sector, even though foreigners have already enjoyed favourable tax treatment on their wealth for a few years. Certainly, it results in an even more simplified tax planning process - always a boon for those mulling a move to Singapore for work or as a primary residence.</p>
