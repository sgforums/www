            <div class='col-md body'>Dear people,<br><br>It is time to put the myth of the Hainanese to rest. Speaking with great authority, as i am a Hainanese myself, there tends to be a general trend in certain characteristic of my ethnicity. As pointed out by my pretty, they tend to be a more hardworking (Aren't all Chinese hardworking?)and stoic bunch of people.<br><br>Well, my pretty's statement has set my mind racing and i shall do some research on my ethnicity before posting more serious stuff on it. The rest of the opinions stated in here is purely my own.<br><br>Hardworking? Very...so hard that the word enjoyment is not hardly mentioned in the older generations. This are the hainanese who work around the clocks and think nothing of holding 2 to 3 jobs. None of my relatives or their fellow brethen have any free time, most are working or if not, sleeping...or gambling.<br><br>Good looking? hahaha, this is where i might get too personal  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>All in all, you will know what i mean if you fellow guy friend is a Hainanese. And yes, they make terrific husbands, although my dad is the more domineering one in the family but i know deep down inside, most Hainanese respect and accord the proper due to women.<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>
