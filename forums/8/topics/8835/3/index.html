            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Mr Hata-san:</div><div class="quote_body">Wish to pass my opinions about the Cantonese too.</div></blockquote>Well well, I am a Cantonese so let's see how well you gauge a Cantonese.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Yes, they tend to be long-winded and sharp with their tongue but on the whole, they are very hospitable people. And yes, their dialect is so polite and sounds rather musical to the ear. I donÂ’t know much about Cantonese guys but I have come into regular contacts with their girls and I must say all I have is praise for them. On the whole, that is.<br></strong></blockquote>*LUFFZ* Well, cantonese girls are sharp-tongued yes, but long-winded?? *PONDERS* As far as I can tell, all my cousins are not long-winded but my grandparents sure are but there's no arguement here because OLD people are in general LONG-WINDED! However, what you say about the hospitability is true! My grandparents, uncles and aunts are all who WELCOME friends (sometimes even people whom they barely knew) into the house to have a meal and to show them around the house!<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Using 2 girls as a case study, I shall call them T and N, I observed some strong characteristic about them. They came from pure Cantonese stocks and both their parents hail from Hong Kong. From close observance of them and their mothers, I came to a general conclusion about them and they are<br><br>a) (Might be biased here but on the whole) very pretty. Not conventional pretty but beauty pageant kind of beauty. Pretty tall and big boned. T measures 165 and N 175 metres tall and both over towers their peers. Not surprised many of them ended up on the catwalk. T has a sister that is in the same category too. Seen NÂ’s cousin and she share the same features as N too. Teochew ladies are not the only pretty one around.<br><br></strong></blockquote>Opps! I fail in this category so I gather I am NOT that pure a Cantonese afterall?    :p Nevertheless, my female cousins do fall in the 'PRETTY' category though they are NOT all that tall themselves! Well, let's move on....<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>b) Very gossipy! Not only do they possess a sharp tongue, they possess a wicked one too! It would be very wise to avoid antagonising them and it is not a coincident that they are the one who invented the practice of hammering paper dolls. Modern Cantonese women used the email and ICQ instead. Far more insidious than the ancient curse.<br></strong></blockquote>*SMILEZ* ALL women are gossipy, NOT only Cantonese women dear! But yes, I do have a WICKED tongue.... don't MOST women do too? Women are in general LESS magnanimous (and no, I am not putting down my own gender) and NEVER incur a woman's wrath! The heart is evil and the tongue is vicious when it happens! That I have to admit but is it really so much worse for a Cantonese woman? That's up to you folks to judge!    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><blockquote><strong><br>c) Great cooks! I just adored Cantonese cuisine and as a general rule, Cantonese girls love to cook for their loved ones. T is a mean cook in the kitchen, and I can personally vouch for it. I still remember with joy at the seafood pasta she cooked, not to mentioned the sambal prawns too! N is too pampered to cook but her mum is an excellent oneÂ…only a matter of time before her mum imparts her skill to her! And blessed is her manÂ’s stomach when that day arrived. Yes, Fang tai is a Cantonese.<br></strong></blockquote>Oh well, I can't really cook for Heaven's sake though I have to admit that my Grandma is a great cook! *SHRUGS* Maybe I should start learning from her! Oh yeah, and she LOVES preparing dishes either with those black chinese mushrooms or scallop! What's the preference for huh?    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> Between, my mum is NOT a Cantonese, she is a Hokkien and is a really great cook too. So are Hokkien women good cooks too then?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>d) Very ambitious! Her urge to climb the career ladder is much stronger than her malesÂ’ counterpart and they are very enterprising! Half the reason why Hong Kong is such an economic success is her women folks. Both T and N come from a very well off family.<br></strong></blockquote>Yups yups! I agree to this COMPLETELY! I have seen how my elder cousins and aunts strive hard for their careers and in fact, most of them OUTSHINE their husbands! Apparently, my cousin-in-laws and uncles do not mind!    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> As for me, I am STRUGGLING with my studies now and will rather NOT mention career. I am just glad that I am still alive and kicking and NOT drowning! *LUFFZ*     :p<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>e) Domineering. From their economic prowess and naturally aggressive mouth, it is no wonder that they often dominate in any relationship, be it among friends, colleagues or lover. Unless you guys liked to be dominated and ran like a ISO 2000 firm, it would be wise to consider more when chasing them. N simply terrorises her suitors while T overlords her lover. Ditto for T and NÂ’s mums. I seldom talk to their fathersÂ…never did have the chance. Think they need to ask for permission first.<br></strong></blockquote>Domineering? Well, I guess most guys are really intimidated by cantonese women! And I am not making false assumptions! Apparently most of my cantonese counterparts told me that their spouses or bf are quite intimidated by them initially and there are many who ran away before because they could not take up the challenge of being together with a Cantonese girl! It can be due to the domineering factor of Cantonese women.... *SHRUGS* Or is it because the guys are just being too wimpish and CAN'T tolerate or take gals who can stand up on her own? I guess only the guys will have the answer!    :p<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Of course, I can go on and on and on. Simply put, these are the main features. On a whole, I love Cantonese women. Guess Hainanese guys are just made for Cantonese women, yin and yang kind of thing.The domineering and the dominated.  *chuckle*<br></strong></blockquote>*LUFFZ* Dated some Hainese guys before, can't say we click all that well!    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>=================================<br>Do Pixies like a rainy day?<br>A-piping through the dell?<br>The Pixies must enjoy the rain;<br>Thats when they weave their spell.<br>Rain drops, rain drops<br>Play a Pixie-tune<br>=================================<br><br>[This message has been edited by pixie_gal (edited 31 August 2000).]</div>
