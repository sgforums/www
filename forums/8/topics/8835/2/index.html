            <div class='col-md body'>i'm hokkien, but not sure what are the typical characteristics of a hokkien...can understand a little bit of simple hokkien, but can't speak, anyway, the language can sound a bit crude.<br><br>my mummy is hainanese, my maternal grandfather is from hainan island, and i've been there before. like fnu said, the toilets are erm..very exposed, with nice fragrance..haha...but the hainan jiaxiang chicken isn't nice at all, wonder what they feed their chickens with, all fats and no meat...<br><br>ok, back to the main point. hainanese girls pretty? if i judge by my mum, got to agree. she looks very young and pretty for her age, and people often think that she's my (or my sisters') sister rather than mum.<br><br>hainanese guys goodlooking? hmm..if i look at my uncles, maybe not quite so (but my grandfather quite goodlooking hehe), but they are definitely good husbands and fathers. and very hardworking. after hearing so many stories of how men cheat on their wives, how bad a husband so and so is, i think men like my uncles are rare and hard to come by. they are so devoted to their families, and give everything they have to them. But maybe this has nothing to do with them being hainanese, maybe it's their upbringing.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wish to pass my opinions about the Cantonese too.<br><br>Yes, they tend to be long-winded and sharp with their tongue but on the whole, they are very hospitable people. And yes, their dialect is so polite and sounds rather musical to the ear. I donÂ’t know much about Cantonese guys but I have come into regular contacts with their girls and I must say all I have is praise for them. On the whole, that is.<br><br>Using 2 girls as a case study, I shall call them T and N, I observed some strong characteristic about them. They came from pure Cantonese stocks and both their parents hail from Hong Kong. From close observance of them and their mothers, I came to a general conclusion about them and they are<br><br>a) (Might be biased here but on the whole) very pretty. Not conventional pretty but beauty pageant kind of beauty. Pretty tall and big boned. T measures 165 and N 175 metres tall and both over towers their peers. Not surprised many of them ended up on the catwalk. T has a sister that is in the same category too. Seen NÂ’s cousin and she share the same features as N too. Teochew ladies are not the only pretty one around.<br><br>b) Very gossipy! Not only do they possess a sharp tongue, they possess a wicked one too! It would be very wise to avoid antagonising them and it is not a coincident that they are the one who invented the practice of hammering paper dolls. Modern Cantonese women used the email and ICQ instead. Far more insidious than the ancient curse.<br><br>c) Great cooks! I just adored Cantonese cuisine and as a general rule, Cantonese girls love to cook for their loved ones. T is a mean cook in the kitchen, and I can personally vouch for it. I still remember with joy at the seafood pasta she cooked, not to mentioned the sambal prawns too! N is too pampered to cook but her mum is an excellent oneÂ…only a matter of time before her mum imparts her skill to her! And blessed is her manÂ’s stomach when that day arrived. Yes, Fang tai is a Cantonese.<br><br>d) Very ambitious! Her urge to climb the career ladder is much stronger than her malesÂ’ counterpart and they are very enterprising! Half the reason why Hong Kong is such an economic success is her women folks. Both T and N come from a very well off family.<br><br>e) Domineering. From their economic prowess and naturally aggressive mouth, it is no wonder that they often dominate in any relationship, be it among friends, colleagues or lover. Unless you guys liked to be dominated and ran like a ISO 2000 firm, it would be wise to consider more when chasing them. N simply terrorises her suitors while T overlords her lover. Ditto for T and NÂ’s mums. I seldom talk to their fathersÂ…never did have the chance. Think they need to ask for permission first.<br><br>Of course, I can go on and on and on. Simply put, these are the main features. On a whole, I love Cantonese women. Guess Hainanese guys are just made for Cantonese women, yin and yang kind of thing.The domineering and the dominated.  *chuckle*<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>
