            <div class='col-md body'>I have been working for a company for about a month now.<br>I have been close with co-worker X. She entered the company the same day with me.<br>Everything was fine and i really like her.<br>But something happened which made me question if I should be caution of her in terms of office politics<br><br>We were sorting out the documents with a Senior Z.<br>When one of the documents was misplaced,<br>Senior Z assumed it was me who misplaced it since I was standing the nearest to the documents shelf at that point.<br>I know it wasn't me because that day the documents were only about 2-3,<br>so I remembered which r those I filed.<br>I told Senior Z that it wasnt me and she 'joking' saying "Liar".<br>When I asked my co-worker X did she handle the misplaced document,<br>Senior Z  interrupted 'joking' saying 'you always bully her'.<br>To my surprise, my co-worker X replied ' Yeah Lor, Dao Yan ( Disliked)'<br><br>1st of all, I know I did not bully my co-worker AT ALL.<br>I even helped her when she couldn't finished her workload.<br>I also know that just because I alway helped her, doesnt mean I can treat her like she own me anything and I didn;t treat her that way. Which is why it is kinda SHOCK when she replied that.<br><br>Here are some of the conclusions I have come up with (on my own and with some of my friends)<br>1. Since she is a newbie, she has to agree with whatever the Senior says. (Boot licking)<br>2. The truth - She really doesn't like me. ( I have to start be careful of her )<br>3. I am being sensetive ( well, I am a woman )<br><br>Should I tell her how I feel about this incident? (my friends said don't cos we don know each other well n she may turns her back on me one day and use this incident against me. Saying I m a petty person who can't take a joke)<br><br>So, tell me what are your conclusion of this matter n if possible, some solutions...<br><br>Thx<br><br></div>

              <p>I have been working for a company for about a month now.<br>I have been close with co-worker X. She entered the company the same day with me.<br>Everything was fine and i really like her.<br>But something happened which made me question if I should be caution of her in terms of office politics<br><br>We were sorting out the documents with a Senior Z.<br>When one of the documents was misplaced,<br>Senior Z assumed it was me who misplaced it since I was standing the nearest to the documents shelf at that point.<br>I know it wasn't me because that day the documents were only about 2-3,<br>so I remembered which r those I filed.<br>I told Senior Z that it wasnt me and she 'joking' saying "Liar".<br>When I asked my co-worker X did she handle the misplaced document,<br>Senior Z interrupted 'joking' saying 'you always bully her'.<br>To my surprise, my co-worker X replied ' Yeah Lor, Dao Yan ( Disliked)'<br><br>1st of all, I know I did not bully my co-worker AT ALL.<br>I even helped her when she couldn't finished her workload.<br>I also know that just because I alway helped her, doesnt mean I can treat her like she own me anything and I didn;t treat her that way. Which is why it is kinda SHOCK when she replied that.<br><br>Here are some of the conclusions I have come up with (on my own and with some of my friends)<br>1. Since she is a newbie, she has to agree with whatever the Senior says. (Boot licking)<br>2. The truth - She really doesn't like me. ( I have to start be careful of her )<br>3. I am being sensetive ( well, I am a woman )<br><br>Should I tell her how I feel about this incident? (my friends said don't cos we don know each other well n she may turns her back on me one day and use this incident against me. Saying I m a petty person who can't take a joke)<br><br>So, tell me what are your conclusion of this matter n if possible, some solutions...<br><br>Thx</p>
