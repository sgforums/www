Him the Almighty Power<br>Hurld headlong flaming from th' Ethereal Skie<br>With hideous ruine and combustion down<br>To bottomless perdition, there to dwell<br>In Adamantine Chains and penal Fire,<br>Who durst defie th' Omnipotent to Arms.<br>Nine times the Space that measures Day and Night<br>To mortal men, he with his horrid crew<br>Lay vanquisht, rowling in the fiery Gulfe<br>Confounded though immortal: But his doom<br>Reserv'd him to more wrath; for now the thought<br>Both of lost happiness and lasting pain<br>Torments him; round he throws his baleful eyes<br>That witness'd huge affliction and dismay<br>Mixt with obdurate pride and stedfast hate:<br>At once as far as Angels kenn he views<br>The dismal Situation waste and wilde,<br>A Dungeon horrible, on all sides round<br>As one great Furnace flam'd, yet from those flames<br>No light, but rather darkness visible<br>Serv'd only to discover sights of woe,<br>Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace<br>And rest can never dwell, hope never comes<br>That comes to all; but torture without end<br>Still urges, and a fiery Deluge, fed<br>With ever-burning Sulphur unconsum'd:<br>Such place Eternal Justice had prepar'd<br>For those rebellious, here their Prison ordain'd<br>In utter darkness, and their portion set<br>As far remov'd from God and light of Heav'n<br>As from the Center thrice to th' utmost Pole.<br>O how unlike the place from whence they fell!<br>There the companions of his fall, o'rewhelm'd<br>With Floods and Whirlwinds of tempestuous fire,<br>He soon discerns, and weltring by his side<br>One next himself in power, and next in crime,<br>Long after known in PALESTINE, and nam'd<br>BEELZEBUB. To whom th' Arch-Enemy,<br>And thence in Heav'n call'd Satan, with bold words<br>Breaking the horrid silence thus began.<br>If thou beest he; But O how fall'n! how chang'd<br>From him, who in the happy Realms of Light<br>Cloth'd with transcendent brightnes didst outshine<br>Myriads though bright: If he whom mutual league,<br>United thoughts and counsels, equal hope,<br>And hazard in the Glorious Enterprize,<br>Joynd with me once, now misery hath joynd<br>In equal ruin: into what Pit thou seest<br>From what highth fal'n, so much the stronger provd<br>He with his Thunder: and till then who knew<br>The force of those dire Arms? yet not for those<br>Nor what the Potent Victor in his rage<br>Can else inflict do I repent or change,<br>Though chang'd in outward lustre; that fixt mind<br>And high disdain, from sence of injur'd merit,<br>That with the mightiest rais'd me to contend,<br>And to the fierce contention brought along<br>Innumerable force of Spirits arm'd<br>That durst dislike his reign, and me preferring,<br>His utmost power with adverse power oppos'd<br>In dubious Battel on the Plains of Heav'n,<br>And shook his throne. What though the field be lost?<br>All is not lost; the unconquerable Will,<br>And study of revenge, immortal hate,<br>And courage never to submit or yield:<br>And what is else not to be overcome?<br>That Glory never shall his wrath or might<br>Extort from me. To bow and sue for grace<br>With suppliant knee, and deifie his power<br>Who from the terrour of this Arm so late<br>Doubted his Empire, that were low indeed,<br>That were an ignominy and shame beneath<br>This downfall; since by Fate the strength of Gods<br>And this Empyreal substance cannot fail,<br>Since through experience of this great event<br>In Arms not worse, in foresight much advanc't,<br>We may with more successful hope resolve<br>To wage by force or guile eternal Warr<br>Irreconcileable, to our grand Foe,<br>Who now triumphs, and in th' excess of joy<br>Sole reigning holds the Tyranny of Heav'n.<br>So spake th' Apostate Angel, though in pain,<br>Vaunting aloud, but rackt with deep despare:<br>And him thus answer'd soon his bold Compeer.<br>O Prince, O Chief of many Throned Powers,<br>That led th' imbattelld Seraphim to Warr<br>Under thy conduct, and in dreadful deeds<br>Fearless, endanger'd Heav'ns perpetual King;<br>And put to proof his high Supremacy,<br>Whether upheld by strength, or Chance, or Fate,<br>Too well I see and rue the dire event,<br>That with sad overthrow and foul defeat<br>Hath lost us Heav'n, and all this mighty Host<br>In horrible destruction laid thus low,<br>As far as Gods and Heav'nly Essences<br>Can Perish: for the mind and spirit remains<br>Invincible, and vigour soon returns,<br>Though all our Glory extinct, and happy state<br>Here swallow'd up in endless misery.<br>But what if he our Conquerour, (whom I now<br>Of force believe Almighty, since no less<br>Then such could hav orepow'rd such force as ours)<br>Have left us this our spirit and strength intire<br>Strongly to suffer and support our pains,<br>That we may so suffice his vengeful ire,<br>Or do him mightier service as his thralls<br>By right of Warr, what e're his business be<br>Here in the heart of Hell to work in Fire,<br>Or do his Errands in the gloomy Deep;<br>What can it then avail though yet we feel<br>Strength undiminisht, or eternal being<br>To undergo eternal punishment?<br>Whereto with speedy words th' Arch-fiend reply'd.<br>Fall'n Cherube, to be weak is miserable<br>Doing or Suffering: but of this be sure,<br>To do ought good never will be our task,<br>But ever to do ill our sole delight,<br>As being the contrary to his high will<br>Whom we resist. If then his Providence<br>Out of our evil seek to bring forth good,<br>Our labour must be to pervert that end,<br>And out of good still to find means of evil;<br>Which oft times may succeed, so as perhaps<br>Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb<br>His inmost counsels from their destind aim.<br>But see the angry Victor hath recall'd<br>His Ministers of vengeance and pursuit<br>Back to the Gates of Heav'n: The Sulphurous Hail<br>Shot after us in storm, oreblown hath laid<br>The fiery Surge, that from the Precipice<br>Of Heav'n receiv'd us falling, and the Thunder,<br>Wing'd with red Lightning and impetuous rage,<br>Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now<br>To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep.<br>Let us not slip th' occasion, whether scorn,<br>Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe.<br>Seest thou yon dreary Plain, forlorn and wilde,<br>The seat of desolation, voyd of light,<br>Save what the glimmering of these livid flames<br>Casts pale and dreadful? Thither let us tend<br>From off the tossing of these fiery waves,<br>There rest, if any rest can harbour there,<br>And reassembling our afflicted Powers,<br>Consult how we may henceforth most offend<br>Our Enemy, our own loss how repair,<br>How overcome this dire Calamity,<br>What reinforcement we may gain from Hope,<br>If not what resolution from despare.<br>Thus Satan talking to his neerest Mate<br>With Head up-lift above the wave, and Eyes<br>That sparkling blaz'd, his other Parts besides<br>Prone on the Flood, extended long and large<br>Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge<br>As whom the Fables name of monstrous size,<br>TITANIAN, or EARTH-BORN, that warr'd on JOVE,<br>BRIARIOS or TYPHON, whom the Den<br>By ancient TARSUS held, or that Sea-beast<br>LEVIATHAN, which God of all his works<br>Created hugest that swim th' Ocean stream:<br>Him haply slumbring on the NORWAY foam<br>The Pilot of some small night-founder'd Skiff,<br>Deeming some Island, oft, as Sea-men tell,<br>With fixed Anchor in his skaly rind<br>Moors by his side under the Lee, while Night<br>Invests the Sea, and wished Morn delayes:<br>So stretcht out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay<br>Chain'd on the burning Lake, nor ever thence<br>Had ris'n or heav'd his head, but that the will<br>And high permission of all-ruling Heaven<br>Left him at large to his own dark designs,<br>That with reiterated crimes he might<br>Heap on himself damnation, while he sought<br>Evil to others, and enrag'd might see<br>How all his malice serv'd but to bring forth<br>Infinite goodness, grace and mercy shewn<br>On Man by him seduc't, but on himself<br>Treble confusion, wrath and vengeance pour'd.<br>Forthwith upright he rears from off the Pool<br>His mighty Stature; on each hand the flames<br>Drivn backward slope their pointing spires, &amp; rowld<br>In billows, leave i'th' midst a horrid Vale.<br>Then with expanded wings he stears his flight<br>Aloft, incumbent on the dusky Air<br>That felt unusual weight, till on dry Land<br>He lights, if it were Land that ever burn'd<br>With solid, as the Lake with liquid fire;<br>And such appear'd in hue, as when the force<br>Of subterranean wind transports a Hill<br>Torn from PELORUS, or the shatter'd side<br>Of thundring AETNA, whose combustible<br>And fewel'd entrals thence conceiving Fire,<br>Sublim'd with Mineral fury, aid the Winds,<br>And leave a singed bottom all involv'd<br>With stench and smoak: Such resting found the sole<br>Of unblest feet. Him followed his next Mate,<br>Both glorying to have scap't the STYGIAN flood<br>As Gods, and by their own recover'd strength,<br>Not by the sufferance of supernal Power.<br>Is this the Region, this the Soil, the Clime,<br>Said then the lost Arch Angel, this the seat<br>That we must change for Heav'n, this mournful gloom<br>For that celestial light? Be it so, since hee<br>Who now is Sovran can dispose and bid<br>What shall be right: fardest from him is best<br>Whom reason hath equald, force hath made supream<br>Above his equals. Farewel happy Fields<br>Where Joy for ever dwells: Hail horrours, hail<br>Infernal world, and thou profoundest Hell<br>Receive thy new Possessor: One who brings<br>A mind not to be chang'd by Place or Time.<br>The mind is its own place, and in it self<br>Can make a Heav'n of Hell, a Hell of Heav'n.<br>What matter where, if I be still the same,<br>And what I should be, all but less then hee<br>Whom Thunder hath made greater? Here at least<br>We shall be free; th' Almighty hath not built<br>Here for his envy, will not drive us hence:<br>Here we may reign secure, and in my choyce<br>To reign is worth ambition though in Hell:<br>Better to reign in Hell, then serve in Heav'n.<br>But wherefore let we then our faithful friends,<br>Th' associates and copartners of our loss<br>Lye thus astonisht on th' oblivious Pool,<br>And call them not to share with us their part<br>In this unhappy Mansion, or once more<br>With rallied Arms to try what may be yet<br>Regaind in Heav'n, or what more lost in Hell?<br>So SATAN spake, and him BEELZEBUB<br>Thus answer'd. Leader of those Armies bright,<br>Which but th' Omnipotent none could have foyld,<br>If once they hear that voyce, their liveliest pledge<br>Of hope in fears and dangers, heard so oft<br>In worst extreams, and on the perilous edge<br>Of battel when it rag'd, in all assaults<br>Their surest signal, they will soon resume<br>New courage and revive, though now they lye<br>Groveling and prostrate on yon Lake of Fire,<br>As we erewhile, astounded and amaz'd,<br>No wonder, fall'n such a pernicious highth.<br>He scarce had ceas't when the superiour Fiend<br>Was moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield<br>Ethereal temper, massy, large and round,<br>Behind him cast; the broad circumference<br>Hung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose Orb<br>Through Optic Glass the TUSCAN Artist views<br>At Ev'ning from the top of FESOLE,<br>Or in VALDARNO, to descry new Lands,<br>Rivers or Mountains in her spotty Globe.<br>His Spear, to equal which the tallest Pine<br>Hewn on NORWEGIAN hills, to be the Mast<br>Of some great Ammiral, were but a wand,<br>He walkt with to support uneasie steps<br>Over the burning Marle, not like those steps<br>On Heavens Azure, and the torrid Clime<br>Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with Fire;<br>Nathless he so endur'd, till on the Beach<br>Of that inflamed Sea, he stood and call'd<br>His Legions, Angel Forms, who lay intrans't<br>Thick as Autumnal Leaves that strow the Brooks<br>In VALLOMBROSA, where th' ETRURIAN shades<br>High overarch't imbowr; or scatterd sedge<br>Afloat, when with fierce Winds ORION arm'd<br>Hath vext the Red-Sea Coast, whose waves orethrew<br>BUSIRIS and his MEMPHIAN Chivalrie,<br>VVhile with perfidious hatred they pursu'd<br>The Sojourners of GOSHEN, who beheld<br>From the safe shore their floating Carkases<br>And broken Chariot Wheels, so thick bestrown<br>Abject and lost lay these, covering the Flood,<br>Under amazement of their hideous change.<br>He call'd so loud, that all the hollow Deep<br>Of Hell resounded. Princes, Potentates,<br>Warriers, the Flowr of Heav'n, once yours, now lost,<br>If such astonishment as this can sieze<br>Eternal spirits; or have ye chos'n this place<br>After the toyl of Battel to repose<br>Your wearied vertue, for the ease you find<br>To slumber here, as in the Vales of Heav'n?<br>Or in this abject posture have ye sworn<br>To adore the Conquerour? who now beholds<br>Cherube and Seraph rowling in the Flood<br>With scatter'd Arms and Ensigns, till anon<br>His swift pursuers from Heav'n Gates discern<br>Th' advantage, and descending tread us down<br>Thus drooping, or with linked Thunderbolts<br>Transfix us to the bottom of this Gulfe.<br>Awake, arise, or be for ever fall'n.<br>They heard, and were abasht, and up they sprung<br>Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch<br>On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread,<br>Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake.<br>Nor did they not perceave the evil plight<br>In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel;<br>Yet to their Generals Voyce they soon obeyd<br>Innumerable. As when the potent Rod<br>Of AMRAMS Son in EGYPTS evill day<br>Wav'd round the Coast, up call'd a pitchy cloud<br>Of LOCUSTS, warping on the Eastern Wind,<br>That ore the Realm of impious PHAROAH hung<br>Like Night, and darken'd all the Land of NILE:<br>So numberless were those bad Angels seen<br>Hovering on wing under the Cope of Hell<br>'Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding Fires;<br>Till, as a signal giv'n, th' uplifted Spear<br>Of their great Sultan waving to direct<br>Thir course, in even ballance down they light<br>On the firm brimstone, and fill all the Plain;<br>A multitude, like which the populous North<br>Pour'd never from her frozen loyns, to pass<br>RHENE or the DANAW, when her barbarous Sons<br>Came like a Deluge on the South, and spread<br>Beneath GIBRALTAR to the LYBIAN sands.<br>Forthwith from every Squadron and each Band<br>The Heads and Leaders thither hast where stood<br>Their great Commander; Godlike shapes and forms<br>Excelling human, Princely Dignities,<br>And Powers that earst in Heaven sat on Thrones;<br>Though of their Names in heav'nly Records now<br>Be no memorial, blotted out and ras'd<br>By thir Rebellion, from the Books of Life.<br>Nor had they yet among the Sons of EVE<br>Got them new Names, till wandring ore the Earth,<br>Through Gods high sufferance for the tryal of man,<br>By falsities and lyes the greatest part<br>Of Mankind they corrupted to forsake<br>God their Creator, and th' invisible<br>Glory of him, that made them, to transform<br>Oft to the Image of a Brute, adorn'd<br>With gay Religions full of Pomp and Gold,<br>And Devils to adore for Deities:<br>Then were they known to men by various Names,<br>And various Idols through the Heathen World.<br>Say, Muse, their Names then known, who first, who last,<br>Rous'd from the slumber, on that fiery Couch,<br>At thir great Emperors call, as next in worth<br>Came singly where he stood on the bare strand,<br>While the promiscuous croud stood yet aloof?<br>The chief were those who from the Pit of Hell<br>Roaming to seek their prey on earth, durst fix<br>Their Seats long after next the Seat of God,<br>Their Altars by his Altar, Gods ador'd<br>Among the Nations round, and durst abide<br>JEHOVAH thundring out of SION, thron'd<br>Between the Cherubim; yea, often plac'd<br>Within his Sanctuary it self their Shrines,<br>Abominations; and with cursed things<br>His holy Rites, and solemn Feasts profan'd,<br>And with their darkness durst affront his light.<br>First MOLOCH, horrid King besmear'd with blood<br>Of human sacrifice, and parents tears,<br>Though for the noyse of Drums and Timbrels loud<br>Their childrens cries unheard, that past through fire<br>To his grim Idol. Him the AMMONITE<br>Worshipt in RABBA and her watry Plain,<br>In ARGOB and in BASAN, to the stream<br>Of utmost ARNON. Nor content with such<br>Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart<br>Of SOLOMON he led by fraud to build<br>His Temple right against the Temple of God<br>On that opprobrious Hill, and made his Grove<br>The pleasant Vally of HINNOM, TOPHET thence<br>And black GEHENNA call'd, the Type of Hell.<br>Next CHEMOS, th' obscene dread of MOABS Sons,<br>From AROER to NEBO, and the wild<br>Of Southmost ABARIM; in HESEBON<br>And HERONAIM, SEONS Realm, beyond<br>The flowry Dale of SIBMA clad with Vines,<br>And ELEALE to th' ASPHALTICK Pool.<br>PEOR his other Name, when he entic'd<br>ISRAEL in SITTIM on their march from NILE<br>To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe.<br>Yet thence his lustful Orgies he enlarg'd<br>Even to that Hill of scandal, by the Grove<br>Of MOLOCH homicide, lust hard by hate;<br>Till good JOSIAH drove them thence to Hell.<br>With these came they, who from the bordring flood<br>Of old EUPHRATES to the Brook that parts<br>EGYPT from SYRIAN ground, had general Names<br>Of BAALIM and ASHTAROTH, those male,<br>These Feminine. For Spirits when they please<br>Can either Sex assume, or both; so soft<br>And uncompounded is their Essence pure,<br>Not ti'd or manacl'd with joynt or limb,<br>Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones,<br>Like cumbrous flesh; but in what shape they choose<br>Dilated or condens't, bright or obscure,<br>Can execute their aerie purposes,<br>And works of love or enmity fulfill.<br>For those the Race of ISRAEL oft forsook<br>Their living strength, and unfrequented left<br>His righteous Altar, bowing lowly down<br>To bestial Gods; for which their heads as low<br>Bow'd down in Battel, sunk before the Spear<br>Of despicable foes. With these in troop<br>Came ASTORETH, whom the PHOENICIANS call'd<br>ASTARTE, Queen of Heav'n, with crescent Horns;<br>To whose bright Image nightly by the Moon<br>SIDONIAN Virgins paid their Vows and Songs,<br>In SION also not unsung, where stood<br>Her Temple on th' offensive Mountain, built<br>By that uxorious King, whose heart though large,<br>Beguil'd by fair Idolatresses, fell<br>To Idols foul. THAMMUZ came next behind,<br>Whose annual wound in LEBANON allur'd<br>The SYRIAN Damsels to lament his fate<br>In amorous dittyes all a Summers day,<br>While smooth ADONIS from his native Rock<br>Ran purple to the Sea, suppos'd with blood<br>Of THAMMUZ yearly wounded: the Love-tale<br>Infected SIONS daughters with like heat,<br>Whose wanton passions in the sacred Porch<br>EZEKIEL saw, when by the Vision led<br>His eye survay'd the dark Idolatries<br>Of alienated JUDAH. Next came one<br>Who mourn'd in earnest, when the Captive Ark<br>Maim'd his brute Image, head and hands lopt off<br>In his own Temple, on the grunsel edge,<br>Where he fell flat, and sham'd his Worshipers:<br>DAGON his Name, Sea Monster, upward Man<br>And downward Fish: yet had his Temple high<br>Rear'd in AZOTUS, dreaded through the Coast<br>Of PALESTINE, in GATH and ASCALON,<br>And ACCARON and GAZA's frontier bounds.<br>Him follow'd RIMMON, whose delightful Seat<br>Was fair DAMASCUS, on the fertil Banks<br>Of ABBANA and PHARPHAR, lucid streams.<br>He also against the house of God was bold:<br>A Leper once he lost and gain'd a King,<br>AHAZ his sottish Conquerour, whom he drew<br>Gods Altar to disparage and displace<br>For one of SYRIAN mode, whereon to burn<br>His odious offrings, and adore the Gods<br>Whom he had vanquisht. After these appear'd<br>A crew who under Names of old Renown,<br>OSIRIS, ISIS, ORUS and their Train<br>With monstrous shapes and sorceries abus'd<br>Fanatic EGYPT and her Priests, to seek<br>Thir wandring Gods disguis'd in brutish forms<br>Rather then human. Nor did ISRAEL scape<br>Th' infection when their borrow'd Gold compos'd<br>The Calf in OREB: and the Rebel King<br>Doubl'd that sin in BETHEL and in DAN,<br>Lik'ning his Maker to the Grazed Ox,<br>JEHOVAH, who in one Night when he pass'd<br>From EGYPT marching, equal'd with one stroke<br>Both her first born and all her bleating Gods.<br>BELIAL came last, then whom a Spirit more lewd<br>Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love<br>Vice for it self: To him no Temple stood<br>Or Altar smoak'd; yet who more oft then hee<br>In Temples and at Altars, when the Priest<br>Turns Atheist, as did ELY'S Sons, who fill'd<br>With lust and violence the house of God.<br>In Courts and Palaces he also Reigns<br>And in luxurious Cities, where the noyse<br>Of riot ascends above thir loftiest Towrs,<br>And injury and outrage: And when Night<br>Darkens the Streets, then wander forth the Sons<br>Of BELIAL, flown with insolence and wine.<br>Witness the Streets of SODOM, and that night<br>In GIBEAH, when hospitable Dores<br>Yielded thir Matrons to prevent worse rape.<br>These were the prime in order and in might;<br>The rest were long to tell, though far renown'd,<br>Th' IONIAN Gods, of JAVANS Issue held<br>Gods, yet confest later then Heav'n and Earth<br>Thir boasted Parents; TITAN Heav'ns first born<br>With his enormous brood, and birthright seis'd<br>By younger SATURN, he from mightier JOVE<br>His own and RHEA'S Son like measure found;<br>So JOVE usurping reign'd: these first in CREET<br>And IDA known, thence on the Snowy top<br>Of cold OLYMPUS rul'd the middle Air<br>Thir highest Heav'n; or on the DELPHIAN Cliff,<br>Or in DODONA, and through all the bounds<br>Of DORIC Land; or who with SATURN old<br>Fled over ADRIA to th' HESPERIAN Fields,<br>And ore the CELTIC roam'd the utmost Isles.<br>All these and more came flocking; but with looks<br>Down cast and damp, yet such wherein appear'd<br>Obscure som glimps of joy, to have found thir chief<br>Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost<br>In loss it self; which on his count'nance cast<br>Like doubtful hue: but he his wonted pride<br>Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore<br>Semblance of worth not substance, gently rais'd<br>Their fainted courage, and dispel'd their fears.<br>Then strait commands that at the warlike sound<br>Of Trumpets loud and Clarions be upreard<br>His mighty Standard; that proud honour claim'd<br>AZAZEL as his right, a Cherube tall:<br>Who forthwith from the glittering Staff unfurld<br>Th' Imperial Ensign, which full high advanc't<br>Shon like a Meteor streaming to the Wind<br>With Gemms and Golden lustre rich imblaz'd,<br>Seraphic arms and Trophies: all the while<br>Sonorous mettal blowing Martial sounds:<br>At which the universal Host upsent<br>A shout that tore Hells Concave, and beyond<br>Frighted the Reign of CHAOS and old Night.<br>All in a moment through the gloom were seen<br>Ten thousand Banners rise into the Air<br>With Orient Colours waving: with them rose<br>A Forrest huge of Spears: and thronging Helms<br>Appear'd, and serried Shields in thick array<br>Of depth immeasurable: Anon they move<br>In perfect PHALANX to the Dorian mood<br>Of Flutes and soft Recorders; such as rais'd<br>To highth of noblest temper Hero's old<br>Arming to Battel, and in stead of rage<br>Deliberate valour breath'd, firm and unmov'd<br>With dread of death to flight or foul retreat,<br>Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage<br>With solemn touches, troubl'd thoughts, and chase<br>Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain<br>From mortal or immortal minds. Thus they<br>Breathing united force with fixed thought<br>Mov'd on in silence to soft Pipes that charm'd<br>Thir painful steps o're the burnt soyle; and now<br>Advanc't in view they stand, a horrid Front<br>Of dreadful length and dazling Arms, in guise<br>Of Warriers old with order'd Spear and Shield,<br>Awaiting what command thir mighty Chief<br>Had to impose: He through the armed Files<br>Darts his experienc't eye, and soon traverse<br>The whole Battalion views, thir order due,<br>Thir visages and stature as of Gods,<br>Thir number last he summs. And now his heart<br>Distends with pride, and hardning in his strength<br>Glories: For never since created man,<br>Met such imbodied force, as nam'd with these<br>Could merit more then that small infantry<br>Warr'd on by Cranes: though all the Giant brood<br>Of PHLEGRA with th' Heroic Race were joyn'd<br>That fought at THEB'S and ILIUM, on each side<br>Mixt with auxiliar Gods; and what resounds<br>In Fable or ROMANCE of UTHERS Son<br>Begirt with BRITISH and ARMORIC Knights;<br>And all who since, Baptiz'd or Infidel<br>Jousted in ASPRAMONT or MONTALBAN,<br>DAMASCO, or MAROCCO, or TREBISOND,<br>Or whom BISERTA sent from AFRIC shore<br>When CHARLEMAIN with all his Peerage fell<br>By FONTARABBIA. Thus far these beyond<br>Compare of mortal prowess, yet observ'd<br>Thir dread Commander: he above the rest<br>In shape and gesture proudly eminent<br>Stood like a Towr; his form had yet not lost<br>All her Original brightness, nor appear'd<br>Less then Arch Angel ruind, and th' excess<br>Of Glory obscur'd: As when the Sun new ris'n<br>Looks through the Horizontal misty Air<br>Shorn of his Beams, or from behind the Moon<br>In dim Eclips disastrous twilight sheds<br>On half the Nations, and with fear of change<br>Perplexes Monarchs. Dark'n'd so, yet shon<br>Above them all th' Arch Angel: but his face<br>Deep scars of Thunder had intrencht, and care<br>Sat on his faded cheek, but under Browes<br>Of dauntless courage, and considerate Pride<br>Waiting revenge: cruel his eye, but cast<br>Signs of remorse and passion to behold<br>The fellows of his crime, the followers rather<br>(Far other once beheld in bliss) condemn'd<br>For ever now to have their lot in pain,<br>Millions of Spirits for his fault amerc't<br>Of Heav'n, and from Eternal Splendors flung<br>For his revolt, yet faithfull how they stood,<br>Thir Glory witherd. As when Heavens Fire<br>Hath scath'd the Forrest Oaks, or Mountain Pines,<br>With singed top their stately growth though bare<br>Stands on the blasted Heath. He now prepar'd<br>To speak; whereat their doubl'd Ranks they bend<br>From Wing to Wing, and half enclose him round<br>With all his Peers: attention held them mute.<br>Thrice he assayd, and thrice in spite of scorn,<br>Tears such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last<br>Words interwove with sighs found out their way.<br>O Myriads of immortal Spirits, O Powers<br>Matchless, but with th' Almighty, and that strife<br>Was not inglorious, though th' event was dire,<br>As this place testifies, and this dire change<br>Hateful to utter: but what power of mind<br>Foreseeing or presaging, from the Depth<br>Of knowledge past or present, could have fear'd,<br>How such united force of Gods, how such<br>As stood like these, could ever know repulse?<br>For who can yet beleeve, though after loss,<br>That all these puissant Legions, whose exile<br>Hath emptied Heav'n, shall faile to re-ascend<br>Self-rais'd, and repossess their native seat.<br>For me, be witness all the Host of Heav'n,<br>If counsels different, or danger shun'd<br>By me, have lost our hopes. But he who reigns<br>Monarch in Heav'n, till then as one secure<br>Sat on his Throne, upheld by old repute,<br>Consent or custome, and his Regal State<br>Put forth at full, but still his strength conceal'd,<br>Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall.<br>Henceforth his might we know, and know our own<br>So as not either to provoke, or dread<br>New warr, provok't; our better part remains<br>To work in close design, by fraud or guile<br>What force effected not: that he no less<br>At length from us may find, who overcomes<br>By force, hath overcome but half his foe.<br>Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife<br>There went a fame in Heav'n that he ere long<br>Intended to create, and therein plant<br>A generation, whom his choice regard<br>Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven:<br>Thither, if but to prie, shall be perhaps<br>Our first eruption, thither or elsewhere:<br>For this Infernal Pit shall never hold<br>Caelestial Spirits in Bondage, nor th' Abysse<br>Long under darkness cover. But these thoughts<br>Full Counsel must mature: Peace is despaird,<br>For who can think Submission? Warr then, Warr<br>Open or understood must be resolv'd.<br>He spake: and to confirm his words, out-flew<br>Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs<br>Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze<br>Far round illumin'd hell: highly they rag'd<br>Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped arm's<br>Clash'd on their sounding shields the din of war,<br>Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heav'n.<br>There stood a Hill not far whose griesly top<br>Belch'd fire and rowling smoak; the rest entire<br>Shon with a glossie scurff, undoubted sign<br>That in his womb was hid metallic Ore,<br>The work of Sulphur. Thither wing'd with speed<br>A numerous Brigad hasten'd. As when bands<br>Of Pioners with Spade and Pickaxe arm'd<br>Forerun the Royal Camp, to trench a Field,<br>Or cast a Rampart. MAMMON led them on,<br>MAMMON, the least erected Spirit that fell<br>From heav'n, for ev'n in heav'n his looks &amp; thoughts<br>Were always downward bent, admiring more<br>The riches of Heav'ns pavement, trod'n Gold,<br>Then aught divine or holy else enjoy'd<br>In vision beatific: by him first<br>Men also, and by his suggestion taught,<br>Ransack'd the Center, and with impious hands<br>Rifl'd the bowels of thir mother Earth<br>For Treasures better hid. Soon had his crew<br>Op'nd into the Hill a spacious wound<br>And dig'd out ribs of Gold. Let none admire<br>That riches grow in Hell; that soyle may best<br>Deserve the pretious bane. And here let those<br>Who boast in mortal things, and wondring tell<br>Of BABEL, and the works of MEMPHIAN Kings,<br>Learn how thir greatest Monuments of Fame,<br>And Strength and Art are easily outdone<br>By Spirits reprobate, and in an hour<br>What in an age they with incessant toyle<br>And hands innumerable scarce perform<br>Nigh on the Plain in many cells prepar'd,<br>That underneath had veins of liquid fire<br>Sluc'd from the Lake, a second multitude<br>With wondrous Art founded the massie Ore,<br>Severing each kinde, and scum'd the Bullion dross:<br>A third as soon had form'd within the ground<br>A various mould, and from the boyling cells<br>By strange conveyance fill'd each hollow nook,<br>As in an Organ from one blast of wind<br>To many a row of Pipes the sound-board breaths.<br>Anon out of the earth a Fabrick huge<br>Rose like an Exhalation, with the sound<br>Of Dulcet Symphonies and voices sweet,<br>Built like a Temple, where PILASTERS round<br>Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid<br>With Golden Architrave; nor did there want<br>Cornice or Freeze, with bossy Sculptures grav'n,<br>The Roof was fretted Gold. Not BABILON,<br>Nor great ALCAIRO such magnificence<br>Equal'd in all thir glories, to inshrine<br>BELUS or SERAPIS thir Gods, or seat<br>Thir Kings, when AEGYPT with ASSYRIA strove<br>In wealth and luxurie. Th' ascending pile<br>Stood fixt her stately highth, and strait the dores<br>Op'ning thir brazen foulds discover wide<br>Within, her ample spaces, o're the smooth<br>And level pavement: from the arched roof<br>Pendant by suttle Magic many a row<br>Of Starry Lamps and blazing Cressets fed<br>With Naphtha and ASPHALTUS yeilded light<br>As from a sky. The hasty multitude<br>Admiring enter'd, and the work some praise<br>And some the Architect: his hand was known<br>In Heav'n by many a Towred structure high,<br>Where Scepter'd Angels held thir residence,<br>And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King<br>Exalted to such power, and gave to rule,<br>Each in his Herarchie, the Orders bright.<br>Nor was his name unheard or unador'd<br>In ancient Greece; and in AUSONIAN land<br>Men call'd him MULCIBER; and how he fell<br>From Heav'n, they fabl'd, thrown by angry JOVE<br>Sheer o're the Chrystal Battlements: from Morn<br>To Noon he fell, from Noon to dewy Eve,<br>A Summers day; and with the setting Sun<br>Dropt from the Zenith like a falling Star,<br>On LEMNOS th' AEGAEAN Ile: thus they relate,<br>Erring; for he with this rebellious rout<br>Fell long before; nor aught avail'd him now<br>To have built in Heav'n high Towrs; nor did he scape<br>By all his Engins, but was headlong sent<br>With his industrious crew to build in hell.<br>Mean while the winged Haralds by command<br>Of Sovran power, with awful Ceremony<br>And Trumpets sound throughout the Host proclaim<br>A solemn Councel forthwith to be held<br>At PANDAEMONIUM, the high Capital<br>Of Satan and his Peers: thir summons call'd<br>From every and Band squared Regiment<br>By place or choice the worthiest; they anon<br>With hundreds and with thousands trooping came<br>Attended: all access was throng'd, the Gates<br>And Porches wide, but chief the spacious Hall<br>(Though like a cover'd field, where Champions bold<br>Wont ride in arm'd, and at the Soldans chair<br>Defi'd the best of Panim chivalry<br>To mortal combat or carreer with Lance)<br>Thick swarm'd, both on the ground and in the air,<br>Brusht with the hiss of russling wings. As Bees<br>In spring time, when the Sun with Taurus rides,<br>Poure forth thir populous youth about the Hive<br>In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers<br>Flie to and fro, or on the smoothed Plank,<br>The suburb of thir Straw-built Cittadel,<br>New rub'd with Baume, expatiate and confer<br>Thir State affairs. So thick the aerie crowd<br>Swarm'd and were straitn'd; till the Signal giv'n,<br>Behold a wonder! they but now who seemd<br>In bigness to surpass Earths Giant Sons<br>Now less then smallest Dwarfs, in narrow room<br>Throng numberless, like that Pigmean Race<br>Beyond the INDIAN Mount, or Faerie Elves,<br>Whose midnight Revels, by a Forrest side<br>Or Fountain fome belated Peasant sees,<br>Or dreams he sees, while over head the Moon<br>Sits Arbitress, and neerer to the Earth<br>Wheels her pale course, they on thir mirth &amp; dance<br>Intent, with jocond Music charm his ear;<br>At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds.<br>Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms<br>Reduc'd thir shapes immense, and were at large,<br>Though without number still amidst the Hall<br>Of that infernal Court. But far within<br>And in thir own dimensions like themselves<br>The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim<br>In close recess and secret conclave sat<br>A thousand Demy-Gods on golden seat's,<br>Frequent and full. After short silence then<br>And summons read, the great consult began.<br>END OF BOOK I</div>
