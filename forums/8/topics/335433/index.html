              <p>4) if you have the money, study overseas. france, canada and the usa are three great options. if you don't have those options, i guess shatec will be fine.. i don't know much about that school, never been there.</p>

              <p>you read to learn about your classics then go on and cook it. understanding taste is very important don't get me wrong. but for a new cook, please.. go learn your damm classics and understand what culinary is all about 1st before even cooking. </p>
              <p>a chef is not one who can only cook, but one that trains, leads, plans and understand what food is really about. i have great cooks but most of them will never be chefs. </p>

              <p>thats where you are wrong.. yes food is the most important aspect of being a chef. chef in french means head. a chef leads, a chef plans, a chef write menus, a chef hires. it's not just cooking. you can be the best cook in the world, but without leadership your kitchen will fail. </p>
              <p>yeah, the 80s - late 90s you can get away without a culinary dip / deg. today, try even getting into a top restaurant in north america without a cert. </p>
              <p>taste buds cannot be changed but by reading and understanding how certain veg, fruit is grown you will get a basic understanding on how to pair or match it. reading by far is a very important aspect in a chef growing. </p>
              <p>yes, taste every thing you cook and eat but reading about it is just as important. you are not going to understand a certain cuisine just by eating it. being a chef is not just to understand the taste, you also need to understand the dish. </p>

              <p><br>Canadian Library or US libraries does not stock as much recipe books?  I saw at Santa Ana California they have shelfs of recipe books and most looks so new.</p>
              <p>For varieties though, Singapore libraries do have more recipe books on different cuisines, in english or mandarin.  The Madarin cook books from Taiwan covers japanese cooking quite well.</p>

              <p>I see cooking as more as a craft. Poetry is an art form. I'm sorry, but noodles spun into towers and designs on plates with different colored sauces do not equal art. </p>

              <p>well, canadian libraries are good. but with more people cooking in toronto then in sg, it's hard to get a hand on any good ones. i just buy em.. i buy the ones that i know i will tend to refer to it alot. </p>

              <p>I was wondering how many people out there who eat everyday can understand food, just like I term a particular expensive restaurant serving 'junk food' yet they have business. just becoz its expensive and not the food is good or the customers just do not understand what is good food. all is needed is more MSG</p>
              <p>good chef are not great chef, if u do not have that taste bud then you are just a chef n nothing more  </p>
