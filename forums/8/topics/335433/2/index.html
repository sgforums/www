              <p>I eat, I taste.  But I am a lousy cook.</p>
              <p>And taste is subjective......the food may be as bland as nothing,  but people can still gobble up the food when they are 1. hungry 2. reminded of their past. 3. cant taste it after burnig the tongue with curry &amp; chilli.</p>

              <p>i don't know whether singaporean chef uses em, i only worked there for 6 months. the only restaurants that really use msg here are those in Chinatown or Pho noodle houses.</p>
              <p>using of msg is frown upon and trust me, food critics and writes do know. chefs in canada do take stands and we have organizations where we stand against using certain products to even fishes. i don't serve chilean seabass or even swordfish in my restaurant. it's against my stand and they are about to be endangered. </p>
              <p>like i said earlier, you have your views. i'm not saying it's wrong but if that is what you believe, good on you. </p>

              <p>I used to work in transit Cafe in sg airport departure hall. msg goes into soups, that battered fried fish and chips &amp; most dishes involving veggies.</p>

              <p>The laksa young tau hu was popular and so is the fried kway teow.  I think the zookeepers do realise that the laksa &amp; fried kway teow has no MSG. :D</p>

              <p>well, i can tell you i do pretty much the same... so do some of the chefs i know in the city. we work 60+ hrs a week standing in the heat cooking. when i get home, i just want a pack of chicken mcnuggets at times ! gross i know ! i enjoy a slice of pizza or a simple bowl of soup. </p>
              <p>the only time i will cook at home is when i have guest over or for breakfast on my off day. yeah, that is pretty much about cooking at home for me. i do all my research for new dishes at work. </p>
              <p>for tv, pretty true about the food network. i catch the good food shows when im back then it's just bob dylan after that while i enjoy a few glasses of wine. i know for sure my other chef friends do the same. but when we were cooks, it was partying every night getting drunk and working for 12 hrs the next day with a hangover !</p>
              <p>at work i'm pretty stern with my cooks. no eating on the line ! eat during your break. </p>

              <p>I was wondering how many people out there who eat everyday can

              becoz its expensive and not the food is good or the customers
              just do not understand what is good food. all is needed is more
              MSG</p>

              <p>it is the chef and server's job of each restaurant to educate the customers what they are putting into their mouths. we do it at my place. my servers are trained in the kitchen too, so they understand what food is all about. </p>
