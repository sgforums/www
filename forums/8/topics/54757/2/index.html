            <div class='col-md body'>basic security "best practices":<br><br>Turn off and remove unneeded services. By default, many operating systems install auxiliary services that are not critical, such as an FTP server, telnet, and a Web server. These services are avenues of attack. If they are removed, blended threats have less avenues of attack and you have fewer services to maintain through patch updates.<br><br>If a blended threat exploits one or more network services, disable, or block access to, those services until a patch is applied.<br>Always keep your patch levels up-to-date, especially on computers that host public services and are accessible through the firewall, such as HTTP, FTP, mail, and DNS services.<br><br>Enforce a password policy. Complex passwords make it difficult to crack password files on compromised computers. This helps to prevent or limit damage when a computer is compromised.<br>Configure your email server to block or remove email that contains file attachments that are commonly used to spread viruses, such as .vbs, .bat, .exe, .pif and .scr files.<br><br>Isolate infected computers quickly to prevent further compromising your organization. Perform a forensic analysis and restore the computers using trusted media.<br><br>Train employees not to open attachments unless they are expecting them. Also, do not execute software that is downloaded from the Internet unless it has been scanned for viruses. Simply visiting a compromised Web site can cause infection if certain browser vulnerabilities are not patched.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Update: Blaster worm infections spreading rapidly<br><br>Network World Fusion, 08/13/03<br><br>The Blaster worm - also known as MSBlast or LoveSAN - has spread rapidly since it was first noticed on Monday. It has infected an estimated 188,000 systems running Microsoft operating systems, including Windows XP, Windows 2000, Windows 2003 and NT, that are unpatched for the so-called RPC vulnerability discovered last month, according to a security firm tracking the worm.<br><br>Alfred Huger, senior director of engineering in Symantec's Security response division, says the 188,000 number as of Wednesday afternoon is a good-faith estimate based on information Symantec is receiving worldwide from a range of sources and tracking systems. He notes that 188,000 infected hosts is a fairly substantial rate of infection, though it still falls far below the several hundred thousand infections attributed to other computer worms in the past, including Slammer, Code Red and Nimda. Like those worms, Blaster is causing disruptions because of its wild and destructive scanning to hunt for new victims. This scanning causes massive congestion inside corporate networks it manages to infect.<br><br>We are getting reports of network congestion caused by this," Huger notes, pointing out that companies are having to shut down computers to clean out the Blaster worm. However, he adds: "We have more to fear from the children of this worm than the worm itself."<br><br>There are concerns that any new variation of Blaster, whose main purpose is to infect computers in order to launch a denial-of-service attack on the Microsoft windowsupdate.com site on Aug. 16, could be much more dangerous. For example, a new variant could carry a payload that destroys files while it's taking over computers Â– something that Blaster doesn't do.<br><br>Huger predicts that Microsoft will be able to successfully defend its Web site against any on-going DoS attack that begins on Aug. 16, given the advance notice Microsoft is getting. But other security experts are not so sure.<br><br>Dan Ingevaldson, engineering manager at the X-Force rapid-response division of Internet Security Systems, says Microsoft may find it hard to ward off an attack since the Blaster worm is not programmed to look for a specific IP address, unlike the infamous Code Red worm which targeted the White House Web site. Blaster is programmed to search for the windowsupdate.com domain name itself. An IP address could be easily changed, but this process is not so simple to protect a domain name.<br><br>Although Blaster is travelling fairly quickly, Huger pointed out it could be infecting at a higher rate if the Blaster code were better designed.<br><br>"The worm is poorly written," said Huger. It sometimes takes down computers instead of infecting them, and when it does infect them, sometimes the Blaster code simply fails to do anything else.<br><br>Microsoft has made patches available for the RPC vulnerability, which was identified last July, but the spread of BlasterÂ’s infection shows many Microsoft-based computers remain unpatched.<br><br>The worm spreads via port 135, and some security advisories have recommended shutting off port 135 at the network perimeter. However, many say that's not an advisable approach inside the network if an infection breaks out.<br><br>"Shutting down port 135 can cause some serious problems in terms of interruptions between Windows machines," says Symantec's Huger, noting that Windows-based machines probably wouldn't be able to see other Windows machines on the network. Mark Shavlik, president and CEO of Shavlik Technologies, also says he wouldn't recommend turning off port 135 inside the corporate network because that could greatly interfere in uncertain ways with Microsoft-based applications.<br><br>Microsoft last month released a software patch for Windows XP, 2000, NT and 2003 to fix the RPC buffer-overflow vulnerability that the Blaster worm exploits.<br><br>However, the online computer-security forum NTBugtraq this week debated whether the Microsoft software patch will work for Windows 2000 running Service Pack 2 (SP2), a version of Windows no longer officially supported by Microsoft.<br><br>Microsoft now officially supports Service Packs 3 and 4, the latest of which came out in June. The Microsoft security bulletin on the RPC vulnerability had only referred to the patch working on SP3 and SP4, although Microsoft now acknowledges it was aware the patch would also work on SP2. And Microsoft's Web site, Windows Update, did not offer the ability to install the patch - known as MS03-026 - on Windows 2000 SP2 systems.<br><br>NTBugtraq conducted the discussion on SP2 and the software patch because many organizations are confused about whether the Microsoft patch would work on their older SP2-based Windows 2000 systems. Russ Cooper, "surgeon general" in worm matters at security firm TruSecure, pointed out on NTBugtraq that the MS03-026 software patch does protect Windows 2000 SP2 systems. The ongoing discussion on NTBugtraq this week brought attention to the issue and got Microsoft back-peddling on it.<br><br>"To be honest, our security bulletin applied to the supported versions of SP3 and SP4," said Stephen Toulouse, security program manager for Microsoft Security Response Center. "The patch itself wasn't tested for Service Pack 2."<br><br>Microsoft has a "life-cycle policy" in which it doesn't officially support patches for outdated releases, but the fact of the Blaster worm and the pressure to take a stand compelled Microsoft to alter its official stance.<br><br>"The patch will install on SP2," said Toulouse. He said it was unusual for Microsoft to alter its patching support relative to life-cycle management, but in this case it was making an exception.<br><br>"It's taken them 27 days to officially say it will work on a platform they design it for," pointed out TruSecure's Cooper, who noted the lack of official support by Microsoft and some patch-management vendors for a patch for SP2 had people working on homegrown methods to apply the patch some way on their own.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Worm programmed to blast Microsoft's patch site<br><br>Network World Fusion, 08/11/03<br><br>Security experts are warning about the spread of a new worm that exploits the so-called remote procedure call (RPC) vulnerability discovered last month in Microsoft XP, 2000 and NT operating systems. The worm, dubbed MSBlast, uses scanning on port 135 to spread. It is set to launch a continuous denial-of-service attack against the Microsoft site, windowsupdate.com, starting Aug. 16.<br><br>The worm spreads by infecting unpatched Microsoft systems for which it scans at the speed of about 20 hosts per second, according to some security professionals analyzing samples of MSBlast. The MSBlast worm was apparently written by someone whose main purpose is to infect machines and have them launch DoS attacks using SYN Flooding against the Microsoft site.<br><br>According to Joe Stewart, senior security researcher at Myrtle Beach, S.C.-based managed security services provider LURHQ, the MSBlast code contains the message "Billy Gates, why do you make this possible? Fix your software!"<br><br>From what Stewart can tell about the code, which began spreading Monday, the worm's author has designed the worm to attack only the site where Microsoft makes software patches available for problems such as the RPC vulnerability.<br><br>Although no major widespread disruptions or DoS attacks on the Internet are known to have taken place since the RPC vulnerability was discovered a few weeks ago, many security experts are expecting a number of isolated attacks or break-ins to occur.<br><br>Last week, Stanford University reported that 2,500 campus computers were broken into because of the RPC exploit, and the University of California at Berkeley also reported similar problems which caused the campus to shut down some network ports, interfering with campus-wide communications. UC Berkeley systems administrators have been spending considerable time tracking down infected PCs, according to sources there.<br><br>Stewart said he believes the MSBlast worm is fairly easy to find on infected computers, but antivirus software will need to be updated to recognize the MSBlast signature.<br><br>Some antivirus security experts are objecting to the name MSBlast since that's the author's name for it, and tradition holds not to honor virus writers by following their given name for their viruses.<br><br>"We're calling it 'LoveSan' or maybe 'Blaster,'" commented Russ Cooper, TruSecure's "surgeon general" for worm-related security matters.<br><br>Vincent Gullotto, vice president at Avert Labs, the antivirus research arm of Network Associates, said MSBlast -- or "Blaster"-- is based on exploit code seen on the Internet last week that showed how a worm could spread.<br><br>Since this proof-of-concept code is part of Blaster/MSBlast, the antivirus signature updates that McAfee made available last Wednesday to protect against the proof-of-concept code would<br>also identify and eradicate this new worm.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Internet worm hits Windows users, crashes computers<br><br>An Internet worm that targets the latest versions of Microsoft's Windows operating system is spreading rapidly around the world.<br><br>The worm, known as "Blaster", "Love-San" or "MS-Blaster", triggers computer crashes and slows Web connections.<br>It specifically targets computers running Windows XP and Windows 2000.<br><br>Security analysts say the worm is unusual, as it does not spread via e-mail but through Web connections.<br><br>At least 124,000 computers using Microsoft's Windows software have been infected worldwide, according to a sample by Symantec's Security Response sensor network.<br><br>Though the origins of the virus are unknown, it is creating havoc for people using Microsoft operating systems.<br><br>"This virus is a virus that actually reboots your machine. You can be typing and all of a sudden a screen will come up and say, your machine will reboot in about five minutes, or ten seconds, and it starts counting down," said Adrian Duncan, Associate Press broadcast engineer.<br><br>Computers infected by Blaster scan the Internet looking for other machines running Windows that have an open security hole -- one that has not been "patched" or given a fix from Microsoft.<br><br>The worm then sends itself to those computers.<br><br>Although some corporate networks were slowed by the worm, no impact on overall Internet traffic was detected.<br><br>The worm surfaced on Monday in the US and quickly spread, taking advantage of a security hole discovered last month in Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows NT, and Windows Server 2003 operating systems.<br><br>Patches for the hole, except for Windows NT 4.0, which the company no longer supports, were put online by Microsoft.<br><br>Both Microsoft and the US Department of Homeland Security have been warning about the loophole since mid-July.<br><br>But according to experts, many office and home users apparently failed to heed those warnings.<br><br>The worm crashes some systems and infects others, but otherwise does no damage, Microsoft said.<br><br>Experts say the worm is poorly written, but new variations of it could be more virulent.<br><br>The patch is available at www.microsoft.com/security.<br><br></div>
