            <div class='col-md body'>I went to the LeftFoot (a store selling sports shoes) at Far East Plaza just now and was dished with atrocious service. Can i rant here &amp; seek your advice?<br>I'm really very very upset.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The shop manager - -removed- (he proudly gave me his namecard) even dared me to speak to his lawyer if I want to complain about him.<br><br>He didnt let my 17-year old cousin change a pair of shoes even though it was his staff's miscommunication that resulted in this.<br><br>He insinuated that we were out to cheat him. He even remarked Â“If you want, I can always write you a cheque of $159 to pay you back the cost of the shoes! I will treat it as a donation to charity!Â”<br>Isn't that an insult.

            <div class='col-md body'>My 17yr old cousin was told by a sales assistant that he could change his shoesize if it doesnt fit. He could go ahead &amp; wear it for a few days to see 1st. &amp; so my cousin wore it but found that it's still too tight. But when he returned today, the Manager said there is no such company policy. He insinuated that we are lying! He was so rude.<br><br>I asked him what he will do if we can identify the staff who gave us the wrong advice. He said Â“I will make the staff pay for the shoes! Cos itÂ’s not my companyÂ’s policy to change shoes that have been worn! The staff have to bear responsibility for giving the wrong info!Â”<br>At that point in time, all his sales assistants were in the shop. I wonder which sales assistant will gallantly admit that he was the one who gave the wrong advice on hearing his bossÂ’s snide remark. True enough, when I asked one of the sales assistant if he knows who, he merely looked at another guy &amp; shook his head uncertainly.<br><br>&amp; so the Manager said "See! it's not them!"<br><br>Why would we go all the way down to cheat him on a pair of $159 shoes?!!<br>This $159 is nothing to a shop owner but means the whole world to a 17year old boy as he had saved up so much for it only to have it collecting dust now as it doesnt fit. His $159 has now gone to the drain.<br><br>And i just couldnt take the attitude of the manager. He was so rude to us!!<br><br>When I walked out of the store, this Anthony smirked, waved and shouted Â“Bye! Have a nice day!!Â” His remark was laced with cynicism. Imagine how I felt then.<br><br>Has anyone has bad experience at this shop?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think this is the service industry singapore currently have.<br><br>Regardless of whose fault, the manager should not say such words.<br><br>My gf and I spent long time in Hong Kong and Tokyo.<br>I rate Tokyo best service and singaproe the lousiest.<br><br>In Tokyo, the staff will keep apologizing you and told you that the shoe cannot be exchanged politely. They will think of ways to solve your problems... if they cannot help, they will apologize and tell you politely eventhough it may be your fault....<br><br>That's why, once my gf and I moved back to singapore, we are not used to the service provided by singapore. ....  And I totally agree with the comment by minister that "singaporean doesn't have service DNA" (note: this is general statement. I must admit there are good sales people in singapore)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you are able to identify the person who gave this offer to your cousin, you can report immediately to CASE and get them to investigate.<br><br>If you can't, it will be difficult to convince them that the shop has not extended its due service. Very seldom do small privateers offer a wear and exchange if does not fit policy. Only medium-sized and large organisations encourage it.<br><br>Again, the manner in which the manager spoke to you (if you quoted him accurately) is unacceptable. However, as with most complaints to CASE, without a witness it's your word against his. The most CASE will do is log your complaint and KIV. If other shoppers encounter similar problems with the same shop or shopowner, then they will investigate and blacklist the shop.<br><br>If you think CASE will take immediate action, dun get your hopes up. This is the situation nowadays. Many customers are rudely served and then challenged to make a complaint. In this case, there is no point in speaking with a lawyer as the cost of the shoes is just below $200/-. Consulation fees can run way beyond that and if the lawyer's letters are exchanged, then legal costs will increase accordingly.<br><br>For now, i recommend that you retain your receipts and put in an official writing to CASE to log-in the matter. Then see how it goes.<br><br>In future, remember to get the name of the person who made this verbal agreement. And try to purchase shoes from a reputable distributor. You may be looking for the best bargains but sometimes, it's worth that little extra to avoid hassles like this.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Piss poor sales service and attitude is an integral part of the Singaporean shopping experience (unless you are ang moh). For the worst of the bunch, try hi-fi or camera salesmen. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You should write a letter immediately to the shop's management to complain, demand an apology from the shop manager and a free exchange of shoes.  Two faults the shop made - wrong information given by salesman and rude behavior to the point of insulting a customer by the shop manager.  Threaten to blow up the matter to the press and CASE if you're not contacted with suitable response within say, 3 days of receiving letter.<br><br>It's best if you can obtain the salesman's name.  If not, state clearly in your letter the date and time your cousin bought the shoes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The quality of service you get in the shops in Singapore might actually be dependent on whether the shop is part of an MNC which exercises strict control over staff behaviour and manners, such as MacDonalds, or just a local business, in which case there would more likely be a lack of a culture of providing good quality service, which results in poor staff manners.<br><br>Having said that, I've been to Left Foot at Far East Plaza before, but never bought any shoes there. I usually go to First Terminal at Suntec instead. I like their selection better, and the staff are courteous and polite.</div>
