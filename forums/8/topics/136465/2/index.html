Eurpoeans are generally more courteous and service oriented.  They would not haggle with you over who's right and who's wrong.  They will give you the benefit of doubt.<br><br>I feel that Singaporeans have the mentality of casting negative impressions of ppl first before giving them the benefit of the doubt.
