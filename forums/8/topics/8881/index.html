            <div class='col-md body'>To those who knows me,<br><br>Mr Hata-san exists no more. This nick shall forever be consigned to the trashcan and it is time I emerged from this stranglehold and proclaim myself a new man. The homage and temple is demolished and the man a total agnostic. The disillusion of idol worshipping has deeply affected and demoralise him and he was faced with the age-old question of Job Vs God. Alas, Mr Hata-san is but a very flawed man and he pales in comparison to Job. He had lost the faith and in return, lost his soul. He had given his heart to his Goddess and that too, is forever lost. Job persisted in his faith while Mr Hata-san did not. He is a man who lost both his soul and his heart but as a newborn agnostic, he did not mind that for he believed fervently that neither exists at all.<br><br>The Far East Pilgrim had reached the end of his journey and his life had reached the zenith. He was an unbelievably persistent man whose faith knew no bound. Nothing and nobody can compared to the devotion he showed to his Goddess. All that is in vain. At the moment of crisis, his faith abandoned him and he began to question himself and his faithÂ…it is all over.<br><br>Â“ I have given my all and everything. And yetÂ…it is not enough. Life has been unfair to me while fate and destiny took me for a fool. I, I Hata-san, shall henceforth denounce my faith and everything I stood for. Â“<br><br>Thus it will be,<br>Forevermore,<br>Mr Hata-san<br><br>------------------<br>The heartless and souless fool.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear people,<br><br>Hi. I am both new and old to this forum. Old as in I knew the people in here and new as in identity and focus. Monogamy is way out of style and the swinging sixties is in! Know me and know me better. I am an egoistic student who is an ardent admirer of historical dates and fabulous figures, who are fascinated by both Marx and Manchurian pearls. I do not suffer fools gladly and take pity on all rejected strays abandoned by the word love. I still stand by my line that all Cupids are a bunch of dickheads whose proper role should be in the gutter and because all they have ever given me is shit. Aye, did I mention that I am cynical as well? I am single now and had mean roving eyes. I am intelligent, good looking and very eligible. And yes, attracted to the opposite sex too. Thus, all females in here beware; there is a new player in town.<br><br>Cheerio,<br>James<br><br>"There are two things a real man likes, danger and play.<br>That's why he likes women, they are the most dangerous of<br>playthings."<br>-- Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche<br><br>------------------<br>The heartless and souless fool.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ahem ahem,<br><br>Pretty, the word chase dare not surface in my mind when I am talking to you. First, there might be bodily hurt resulting from overzealous lovers and secondly, I know the person you are thinking day and night does not start with the capital J.<br>However, we both know morals and principles stand for nuts when there are nothing but chemistry between us. I look forward to this evening, a latte perhaps Mademoiselle?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Matahari:</div><div class="quote_body">ahem, ahem.<br><br>am i going to be chased too?  i know you have written that prodigal's first law is outdated but will you?  should i beware on our coffee time or can i assume that you will just treat me like a married older sister (and in that case i think i'd cancel the date ;p)</div></blockquote>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>
