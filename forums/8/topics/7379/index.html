Love the person unconditionally.. it's the purest form of love. If it's not meant to be and you have to part, it's just that fate brought you together but destiny doesn't permit it to go all the way.

            <div class='col-md body'>I wonder why most of the "Love Is Over" posts in this forum come from us guys, eg. Racife Xec, MysteryRider, Shake and poopooMoon. Has our generation of man becomes more open/sensitive to share our feelings or have we become more like whiners? Seems like it is the girl's power era now. They are now having upper hands and taking control in relationships...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Racife Xec, I know how you are feeling now 'cos I been thru this shit too. Just learn to suck it in and move on alrighty? Memories are bound to hurt. Try to shut them off for a little while to help ease the pain ay.<br><br>Yeah, it will be good if we can know the reasons for the breakup 'cos reasons help us rationalize our thoughts, thus reducing the hurt. However to the fairer (fairer? is it appropriate considering girl's power?) sex, reasons don't really matter. They work based on feelings. When her feelings for you fade away, it will be hard to win her back based on your reasons. I'm pretty sure you tried explaining to her why the r/s shouldn't end. But most prolly, she didn't respond positively 'cos that wasn't what she wanted to hear.<br><br>Like what my dear sister told me, "You can't see a person's heart. All you can do is read it from his actions." So if you wanna know what cause her to leave you (be it a better catch, communication breakdown or personality differences), try reading from her actions.<br><br>Take a deep breath and SUCK IT IN YO!</div>

Have we trusted each other enough? What have I done wrong to make her leave?<br>In my humble opinion, if I'm in your shoes, I will let her leave since it's her choice and I love her enough to let her go. I will be contented enough just to be good friends with her.<br>--------------------------------------------<br>Love is to give without expecting any return</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Racife Xec,<br><br>I was passing by to see what is going on here, as I have been away from the forum for a long time.... I supposed I was here to search for something, and just come back to take a look... Wonder why I have decided to write something here, because I do not wish to see another suffering person after reading your post..<br><br>I understand perfectly of the pain that you are going thru. Believe me, I have been through that as well. It went thru twice and the last time ended with me crashing really badly and now there is no more in Singapore which means anything more to me, not even my family. It has been a year and I am still trying to move on with my life in UK. Like you, every now and then, even years later, something will remind you of her - a certain smell, a few notes of a song - and suddenly you feel just as bad as the day she told you she never wanted to see you again. If you want to know the honest truth... you never completely get over a woman you really cared about.<br><br>However, a person cannot live in the past forever. Unfortunately, there is no choice but to move on in the end, even if you know that she would never come back to you. If you don't move on, then in the end, you realize that you cannot accomodate the next one in your life. You will end up losing all the possible opportunities in the midst. I made a recent mistake like this, and lost someone where a r/s is now no longer possible between us, as according to her. I regretted that, and I missed her a lot nowadays as we are not in contact for sometime. Don't make that kind of mistake, because it is not worth it.<br><br>The only thing you can do, is to learn to take care of yourself, and be contented with what you have in life. I am now trying to make my life meaningful, so that someday when I see this gal again, I would show her in my actions that I have already moved on with my life... Even though we might not be together, at least, I can carry on without losing hope.<br><br>Love does not end even if you don't see somebody. Always remember that the past is past and ghosts are always ghosts, there is only the present and the future to seek... My dream is to find that someone, and when every nite, I slept, I wished that there would be this woman who would wake me up the next morning as my gf and wife... I know that I would be disappointed every morning because I have to wake up alone, but there is always another day where you can still hope.<br><br>Do take care..... As I will be leaving this place now again, and come back some other day and hopefully, by then you would be a happy man and found someone who would light up your life... hope that this post would light up your day....<br><br>yours sincerely,<br>The Prodigal<br>Just passing by...<br><br>------------------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights. However, love is not about finding someone to relieve you, but love is about you devoting your heart and soul to love that someone, even if you know that someone do not love you the way you do."<br>- Prodigal</div>
