            <div class='col-md body'>I think the question should be "do you think singapore WILL be a vibrant arts center?"<br><br>I guess in some way we have cover some grounds all these years. We got the performers but will we ever have the audience? This is especially true when our basic background is in the sciences. Unless singapore successifully blends science and arts together one day, we might would still be where we are today.<br><br>hope that make sense</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>quite impossible. at least for now.<br><br>arts scene isn't something attain thorugh setting up a place for it. arts is supposed to be spontaneous, instead of restricting it to a so-call theatre by the bay.<br><br>to be a vibrant arts center, first there must be sufficient art activities going on, instead of promoting it once a year, together with great singapore sale this year somemore.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>and the mindset of most people when speaking of arts is that it is something that foreigners can go ahead to do, but they would not do it themselves.<br><br>how many of you actually wants to study art ie painting, sculpture, theatre, etc, or design ie fashion, interior, architecture, graphics or mass comm but decided against it because it is socially unacceptable.<br><br>Yes, i admit doing arts is easier now, but not as easy as doing engineer, business, IT, etc.<br><br>the day when everyone can accept arts is the beginning to a art scene, and a small step towards a vibrant arts centre.<br><br>my 2cents.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i don't think singapore's culture (or lack of) is very condusive for fostering an interest in arts.<br><br>anyway, i feel the attempts the government has made at trying to turn singapore into an arts center comes across as rather hypocritical and the intention wasn't really altruistic. the government is interested in developing singapore into an arts center only because of the economic gain involved.<br><br>the government's attempt at fostering an interest in arts isn't going to very successful, because the government has always stifled the development of any culture singapore might have had. now that they realize its not in their favour, they're trying very hard to undo what they have already done. building up a singaporean identity or culture isn't something you can do last minute, like the way someone can mug for an exam last minute, and throwing money at the issue like what they're doing now isn't really going to help. just take a walk along orchard road during the weekends and you'll see a whole crowd of singaporeans devoid of any identity, and hungry for one. they readily latch on to any new culture or identity, be it japanese, american, black, taiwanese or what have you. i think ah_nic has lamented about this before and he couldn't be more right.<br><br>to put it bluntly, i don't think singapore's leaders are very in touch with the community, and seem to be mostly perched in their hypothetical ivory towers. basically, bad EQ. they wanted to promote social cohesion, but they tried to snuff out singlish, which they didn't see was what helped to bond the various ethnic groups together through a common, though informal tongue. instead, they insisted on having each ethnic group preserve its cultural identity, which they failed to see, actually creates walls and boundaries and creates tensions between the various ethnic groups. be it whether ahmad doesn't like mr chen burning all the incense during the hungry ghosts festival or that sanesh doens't like edward england hugging his wife when they meet, sticking to one's cultural identity instead of blending into a common one, merely promotes discrimination and racism.<br><br>in a way, singapore has sacrificed its development of a culture and identity in order to allow efficiency and to enforce order. the development of a culture and an identity could have been allowed together with the enforcement of order and efficiency through careful monitoring, but singapore's leaders have pursued the latter to the extent where the former has become almost impossible. singapore's leaders are simply too authoritative. they're almost like the typical overly-strict parents who coop up their kids at home without allowing any phone calls and follow their kids around on their dates.<br><br>to be honest, i don't really have any suggestions as to how this may be rectified, and this is probably why i'm not the prime minister. so for all intents and purposes, whoever reads this can take this as non-constructive criticism. in reply to the topic question, my answer is no, i don't think singapore is a vibrant arts center, at least not in a very superficial way and unless singapore's leaders change the way they solve problems, nothing much is really going to happen.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My personal take on this issue is more practical. If doing arts can bring in bacon and bread on the table everyday to feed yourself and family, then why not?<br><br>However, having practical customers like we, how much are we willing to fork out money to see those arts performance? With no money coming forth, how are the arts performer going to survive?<br><br>Unless we abolish the concept of money and revert back to ancient times, we may just treat arts as an essential form of lifestyle to be appreciated and enjoyed.<br><br>I came across an article somewhere back in Straits Times, those doing arts full-time are surviving on very meagre grants by our government and true to their passion, they dun mind it, perhaps only cut down on their lifestyle spending.<br><br>Jack Neo and the likes are the rare examples who can actually sustain their lifestyle on arts (if you call his acts as arts?). But he did admit during interviews that he do face a lot of problems along the way to current status.</div>
