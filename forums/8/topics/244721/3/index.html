            <div class='col-md body'>I heard of this story while I went to Indonesia for CNY. As told to me by my neighbour. Its originally in hokkien so i have to translate.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br><blockquote>That night was very hot, I couldn't sleep in the bedroom so i came out to sleep outside. It was around 12am and the street was silent. After lying for a few minutes and i was falling asleep. Then suddenly, i heard something near the bridge there. It was as if someone (or something) was begging or crying for something. Feeling strange i lay up and looked at the direction at which the sound came from. Nothing. Thinking it was just me, i ignored it and try to sleep once again. Just when i was about to fall asleep again. The sound came again. And once again i saw nothing. I feel a bit scared already, but still continue to try sleeping outside cos the bedroom is too stuffy already.<br><br>Finally i fall asleep.... It was about half an hour later, the noise woke me up again. This time it was right beside me!. I went straight into the house and switched on the lights. Then I saw <strong>IT</strong>!! Strangely, i wasn't scared when i saw it. And almost immediately i hit it with both my hands.......<br><br>It was a darn mosquito begging for blood.</blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, there was once I stayed out late and came home past midnight. I plopped on my bed after changing because was lazy to shower.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>It was dark when I switched off the lights. And I tried to fall asleep as fast as I could because I felt like something was watching me. I thought it was normal, just in my mind. Some more, there was moon light shining in my window and this caused some creepy shadows which just adds to the spookiness I was feeling. So I was quick to dismiss this feeling.<br><br>After some tossing around in bed, I eventually fell asleep... but only for a while. For some unexplainable reason, I came wide awake again and I looked up... to see a large spider! It was as big as my hand! Now, I might not be so freaked out if it was some distance away, but my bed is pushed up against the wall, and this spider, all black, was on the wall about 1 foot away from my face!<br><br>KNN, I practically somersaulted out of bed and rushed to the light switch! I remember thinking, "How the heck did this big spider get in my room? I always keep the door and window closed". This is true because my room has a normal door, plus a screen door on the outside which always shuts itself.<br><br>Anyway, by the time the lights were on, I couldn't see the spider anymore. I hunted around the whole room. After all I didn't want a big freaking spider capable of biting my finger off in my room while I slept. I looked under the bed, behind the headboard, and all over the room but I could not find it. How the hell did such a big spider hide itself so well?<br><br>Then I began thinking... could this spider be something else...? This line of thinking made me decide to do some late night furniture shifting and I slept the rest of the night with my lights on.<br><br>There is something to be learnt from all this. If you hear furniture being moved at night, it's probably your neighbour who saw some unusually big insect in his/her room.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Years ago, when I was only a 13 year old girl(year 2002), my friends and I went to a haunted house(according to my friends, it was a 'old' mental hospital[OMH]) located at Admiralty road(extremely deserted) after our Big Walk on Sunday.<br><br>Apparently, that Sunday was an extremely eerie Sunday for us, it was also the 7th day of 7th month in the lunar calendar, the day which was belief to be the day where the ghosts are 'stronger' and more-'invincible'.<br><br>First, we all gather up 11 people and chionged our we to the haunted house. I thought there won't be something for me to be afraid about going to that OMH as I had never believed my friend when they say they encounter dirty things there.<br><br>The boys stormed the front and climbed over the tall gate to enter the locked gate. For the girls, and some lazy boys, they will go under the drain and get into the OMH.<br><br>When two of my friends stormed into the OMH, the rest followed slowly. Suddenly, the two of them shouted and dashed out of the OMH, the rest who were trying to get in dashed out of the drain immediately. At that point of time, I was still outside the OMH waiting to get in last with another friend of mine.<br><br>All of us panicked la of course, but before anybody could ask them what happened, we already saw what made them dashed out of the OMH...........<br><br>There was an elderly man walking nearer to the gate, all of us were staring at him, stunned. He unlocked the lock and welcomed us all into the OMH. Those naughty boys went forward and spoke to the old man. So the old man was like speaking in some language we had never heard of, but....somehow, we understood what he was saying.<br><br>Scary hor?<br><br>So we actually talked cock with the old man, at that point of time, we thought he was the watchman....then we was like asking him the history of the building, then he just smiled and told us not to fool around inside and not to stay for a long time.<br><br>All of us explored the place, saw bats, bee hives, broken windows, eerie toilets, vandalised wall........<br><br>Everytime we change a level or block, we'd always see the watchman below the building. We didn't really bother and just continued fooling around in the building. When we were about to leave, we thanked the watchman and he told us to come back during November for fruits and al of us made an empty promise to him.<br><br><strong>Weeks after, we thought through and realised it was not logical;</strong><br><br>1) Would the government pay a watchman to 'watch' over a building that's deserted?<br><br>2) How come we understood the language he was using when it was really, a language we had never heard of?!<br><br>3) The watchman was under a block whereby there's no entrance to that "void deck" of the block unless he go up with us and then go down again just to look at us.<br><br>4) He watered the grass with a pipe. Never was there water supply in that god damn building!<br><br>5) Fruits? What fruits? There's no fruit tree there.<br><br>6) We've friends who go to the OMH like their weekly CCA and none of them saw the 'watchman' according to us before. Some of my friends even spent their night over there and had never seen that 'watchman'.<br><br>FREAKY.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>my classroom was said tt someone had committed suicide in there before. As my classroom was on the last floor, it have a beam on top as designs where it held onto the ceiling fans.<br>And it was said, the person hang himself there using a role of nylon strings. The nylon strings was twirled over and over again over the beam so that it might not snap under his weight and spoil his suicide attempt.<br>Eventually, that guy died and his body was found the nxt day by the uncle who comes to sch everyday to unlock the doors. (My sch uncle if the previous day got ppl in the classroom and over his working time, he would just go home instead of waiting for the ppl to leave and lock up the room).<br><br>From that day onwards, it was said tt at night, ard 10pm, you can see somethng swaying to and fro frm the ceiling if u watch the classroom from the opposite HDB block. And once, my friend left his phone on the table in the classroom. As he was goofing around the previous day, he left the video on and the camera facing upwards.<br>The nxt day, we can make up 2 feet dangling over the camera...</div>
