Hwat I was saying was to those who said they just THROW the postcard away when his/friend gave to them. What does it show.<br><br>Of course, we don't force people to go if they really don't want to.  City Harvest Church is a charismatic church. The way MANY of them do is about the same but don't take it as a force or a pressuring things to go. WE DO NOT FORCE PEOPLE TO GO. I agree, some may be a bit pestering.<br><br>REMEMBER we do not want your sympathy kind of money. If you want to give this kind of money, then they will not accept even if you give $10 or $1000. We want people who will give willingly.  The money they gave is not for them but for GOD.  We use a these funds to build church,school,hospital in other countries such as Banda Ache &amp; Malaysia.<br><br>You may be know the goodness in it. When you know it, ou may think it ortherwise.  I am not trying to change your mindset but to explain why and how the things we do.<br><br>We are imperfect people including people.  So don't think that CHC people should be a perfect people and set an example for others.  We are all human, we do sin also.<br><br>Whoever seen a CHC member take a gun or knife to force people to go. Never right. You want or don't want to go is up to you. It's your decision.  One of CHC goal, to take the nation by storm and to be a whole new generation for them.<br>You may not agree but you cannot stop they way they do.  They do is not because they want to be yaya-papaya or what, they just want to do good thing for GOD.  How many peoples here think that CHC will not be able to build a builing in 1998(Economic Slump).  Maybe you thought of that right, but we proved it wrong, not by the work of man but by the words of GOd.</div></blockquote>if they throw the postcard away, it shows that they do not accept the invitation or w/e? you mean u want him/her to keep it if he/she doesnt want it? do you keep your leftover food in the fridge for no reason?<br><br>2 or more invitations is enough to piss people off already. think of it this way, forcing is doing everything you can to make something happen. imagine if person A pesters person B to go, isnt person A doing whatever he can to make person B go? please don't say that they only just ask, the people that have asked me to go to CHC were my friends, and they say things like " go with me lah, after that then we only go watch movie together lah.. i thought you said you wanted to watch "input movie name here" later then we watch together"<br><br>do not want sympathy kind of money? lmfao.. which church asks questions before offerings and donations, do they ask " are you doing this because you believe in god or are you doing this for sympathy " or anything similar? i dont know about other churches in singapore but from what i know, among approximately 10 churches or more, none of them do that.<br><br>so you say that we are not perfect. and yes i agree everyone is not perfect. so what makes chc people and the normal people different? are you trying to say that by going to chc we will be more more perfect and less imperfect? if thats the case are you trying to say that unless we go to church we will become better people? and if you're trying to say that we cannot become better people when we go to church, then why do you want to go to church in the first place?<br><br>you dont have to be wielding a weapon to be forcing. take the nation by storm? im not being very provoking, but just take a look at the goal and think about it. " take the nation by storm " this sounds forceful and obsessive, as we know itself, storms are powerful and natural disasters. don't you think using storm is a little too harsh? no offence but this goal sounds something like "kill the enemy by surprise"<br><br></div>

What does it show."<br><br>Response:<br><br>Yes you did say that you disapproved of their action of throwing away this postcard in such a fashion and under the aforementioned circumstances; and my point was that in the circumstances in question, one cannot assume that their having thrown the postcard away in such a fashion is an act for which they should be liable to be held culpable by God.<br><br>In fact, under the same set of circumstances, it may very well behoove someone to throw away the postcard in such a fashion, so that if he were to have felt himself compelled by his conscience to throw it away in such a fashion (and under the selfsame set of circumstances in question) it may very well be a sin for him not to so throw it away.<br><br>This is the fundamental point that you have still pathetically failed to grasp.<br><br>2)"Of course, we don't force people to go if they really don't want to. City Harvest Church is a charismatic church. The way MANY of them do is about the same but don't take it as a force or a pressuring things to go. WE DO NOT FORCE PEOPLE TO GO. "<br><br>Response:<br><br>Stop trying to introduce red herrings into this discussion. No-one ever stated that your 'church' had 'forced' anybody to attend its services; and I am myself perfectly willing to concede, for the purposes of this discussion, that no-one from your church had ever compelled anyone else to attend your church's services through the use of force or other coercive means.<br><br>What I was objecting to rather, was your making it out that it would in every set of possible circumstances be improper that anybody should ever see fit to reject openly your invitation to him to attend the services of your church, by way of, say, throwing away a postcard that had been given to him by someone from your church, in the very presence of the person who had so given it to him.<br><br>3) "REMEMBER we do not want your sympathy kind of money."<br><br>Response:<br><br>Again, this is wholly irrelevant because by your very own admission you want people who 'willingly' give regularly to your church's coffers of their monthly income.<br><br>In any case, what if your church's position that it doesn't want to accept money given to it out of sympathy, is precisely a feature that renders it more probable than not that, all other things being equal, the average-income earner who finds himself (for whatever reason) attracted to your church's teachings and practices, will give regularly to your church's coffers out of his monthly income; and, more specifically, what if the leaders of your church were to be aware of the fact that this particular feature of your church can so be made to serve as a selling-point in the way that I have just described?<br><br>Can you deny that many advertisers, in hawking their products, appeal to a potential buyer's sense of pride, by way of the insinuation of the message that these products are so expensive as to be beyond the reach of the lower-earning classes of consumers?<br><br>4) "The money they gave is not for them but for GOD. We use a these funds to build church,school,hospital in other countries such as Banda Ache &amp; Malaysia."<br><br>Response:<br><br>I won't question their sincerity in their use of the funds that they may have at their disposal, because I certainly am not in a position to be sure that every instance of their use of these funds is adapted by them to serve as a means to the end of their own enrichment.<br><br>However, I do question their teachings and their practices and the lavishness and flagrant ostentatiousness of the lifestyle of some of  their principal representatives.<br><br>Their defects in this regard serve to mark them out collectively as a so-called 'church' that truly does not have any mission from God.<br><br>5) "You may be know the goodness in it. When you know it, ou may think it ortherwise. I am not trying to change your mindset but to explain why and how the things we do."<br><br>Response:<br><br>On the contrary, you haven't explained anything in the sense of your having been able to justify your position in the teeth of the various criticisms that I have directed against it.<br><br>Far from therefore 'knowing the goodness in it, I stand firm in the conviction that I know that what you have is at best a 'form of Godliness, which lacks the power thereof'.<br><br>6) "We are imperfect people including people. So don't think that CHC people should be a perfect people and set an example for others. We are all human, we do sin also."<br><br>Response:<br><br>Indeed we all sin from time to time, and nobody is expecting anyone in your so-called 'church' or anyone else, for that matter to lead lives that are wholly free from sin; this again is another red herring that you are deliberately introducing to obscure the real issue.<br><br>I fully admit that it would be unfair for anyone to single out the people of your church for criticism on the grounds that they have failed to be 'a perfect people' and so have failed to 'set an example for others'; but I also fully deny that this was precisely what anybody had ever been trying to do.<br><br>You have confused a sinning person who is under no illusions as to the fact that some of the patterns of his behaviour are sinful, with another person who may sin not a bit less than the first, but who, unlike the first person, continues to suppose that some of the patterns of his behaviour which are in fact sinful, are patterns of behaviour that are in conformity with God's moral will.<br><br>To my mind, this is the problem with your so-called 'church': not that its members sin, but rather that it promotes teachings and practices that directly and indirectly endorse a lifestyle that in my view would be repugnant to God.<br><br>There is all the difference in the world between a sinner who is willing to acknowledge himself as such, and another person who is as much a sinner as the first, but who refuses to acknowledge that some of his beliefs are false and that some of his habitual patterns of behaviour are sinful; and who accordingly therefore not only acquiesces in the fact that he is disposed to certain patterns of behaviour that are objectively sinful, but who also even commends these patterns of behaviour to others.<br><br>Stop fogging up the real issue, just as the Devil would have you do.<br><br>7)" How many peoples here think that CHC will not be able to build a builing in 1998(Economic Slump). Maybe you thought of that right, but we proved it wrong, not by the work of man but by the words of GOd."<br><br>Response:<br><br>So you think that you that the building of your so-called 'church' or the purchase of it at a time when the economy was in the doldrums, can serve to prove that the building of it or the purchase of it was not by the 'work of man' but wrought by 'the words of God'?<br><br>But if God makes the sun shine on the good and on the evil, how then can you be sure that the working of this accomplishement was not the operative effect of the kind of grace that God should be willing to give to anyone, regardless of whether or not such a person should truly be a child of His?<br><br>How can you be so deluded as to see in the building of a 'church' or the purchase of the relevant premises and structures, a miracle which ought to establish for everyone concerned that whatever it is that your church should have accomplished in this regard, was a work that had to have God's approval?<br><br>How dare you effectively equate the building or purchase of a structure by means of funds that were raised by the solicitation of donations, with the working of a miracle by God which has enough of a warrant about it as to commend itself to any reasonable person as a miracle wrought directly by God?<br><br>You are truly deceived.<br><br>Ps. Keep up the good work, Fugue!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>Hi Fugue,<br><br>You raise an interesting question.<br><br>I feel that the answer to it will have to depend on what exactly you mean by the term 'to moonlight'.<br><br>If by 'to moonlight' you are referring to the act of a person who is already employed in one profession, seeking to be employed in another profession, then I'm not sure whether it would be prudent that a pastor should allow himself to 'moonlight' in this way.<br><br>If the pastor already draws a salary that is paid to him out of his church's coffers, then I don't see why he would have to seek employment in a different profession, unless he feels that the remuneration his current salary affords him is insufficient for the purposes of meeting what he conceives to be his needs.<br><br>In a case where the pastor is truly paid by his church a salary that cannot meet what may truly be ascertained to be (with reference to objective criteria)  his authentic needs (as opposed to whatever desires of his own that he would like selfishly to conceive of as corresponding to his authentic needs), then I think that it would be legitimate that he should seek to moonlight, in what would, of course, be a legitimate mode.<br><br>In contrast to what some of the other so-called 'Christian' posters here have declared, I do not think that there is anything that could in principle be wrong with the idea of a pastor moonlighting as a singer.<br><br>If my church truly pays me a salary that truly is insufficient to meet what are truly my authentic needs, then of course I may moonlight as a singer, insofar as it is the case that to moonlight as a singer would involve me in doing no more than the singing of songs, regardless of whether or not the songs which I should sing should win the approval of the few or the many; for I do not think that there could be anything that in itself would be wrong with the singing of songs so as to disqualify it as a mode whereby a pastor might legitimately seek to 'moonlight'.<br><br>In other words, I can conceive of situations wherein a pastor could legitimately function as a popular singer as part of an attempt on his part at 'moonlighting'.<br><br>The problem that people ought to have with a pastor moonlighting as a singer of popular music therefore should not turn upon the fact that the music in question should be popular; rather, what ought to perturb someone about a so-called pastor who 'moonlights' as a popular singer, is the question of whether or not it is the case that the songs which he or she sings or the music which he or she produces is calculated to appeal to the masses in a mode that is not legitimate and which accordingly involves him or her in the flouting of moral boundaries.<br><br>I hope this suffices to answer the question you have raised.<br><br>Ben<br><br></div>
