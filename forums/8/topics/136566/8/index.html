Tell me, is this the way to treat a newcomer? My Dad is the IC of our church's FTA(first time attender) ministry, and we all know the basic fact that you give the newcomer the best impression, we are not self centred people, we are God centred people. what is it with comments like "our pastor don't like it'??<br><br>and lastly, are you sure what you said is pleasing to God's eye? seriously, i do not wish to start an argument with you, i just hope you can think about what you are saying, really.<br><br>To the other non-CHCers: pai seh guys, got to talk THEIR language lah, or else cannot get thru to them one :p</div></blockquote>I really like your statement about God being rejected over the letter and not those who post it. Nice.<br>Evangelism to them has become a quota target reaching duty.<br><br>I personally feel that leaving halfway in the midst of service is not right, but you do have the right reason to do so.<br><br>The fault here is from the usher. 'Our pastor don't like....'<br>He didn't present his pastor and the reverance of the service in the right light.<br>In this area, i feel that it's the usher's inexperience way to deal with people. Again i would say, the leadership have the right intent. But somehow the message was passed down with unclear intent already.<br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>1) "I mean the way that you do it totally wrong. Someone or rather your friends spend his/her time to buy the stamp and wrote something for you and you just throw it away,just by doing that. How would you feel when someone did that do you?"<br><br>Response:<br><br>If it's a question of accepting what is merely a stamp that my friends have bought for me and intend to be giving to me as a gift, then I would agree that it is true that I would be doing them a disservicing (all other things being equal) if I were to throw back into their faces the stamp that they have bought for me.<br><br>However, rejecting openly the invitation to attend the sevices of a church that someone may issue to me (regardless of whether or not he is a friend of mine), on the grounds that the said church professes beliefs and endorses practices that are in my opinion dangerous, would not be tantamount to doing this particular person a disservice.<br><br>In asking me or in otherwise inviting me to attend the services of his church (regardless of the trouble he may have been put through, in order for him to have been able to do this), this person ought to realise that the right is entirely reserved to me to refuse this invitation; and that because I may refuse it on the grounds that I disagree profoundly with some of the practices and beliefs of his church, it would follow therefore that I would be not only entitled to refuse his invitation to attend his church but even indeed to do so in a way that would have left him in no doubt as to where I stood concerning my esteem of his church.<br><br>To accept a gift like a rubber ball (where the giver of the rubber ball was well-intentioned in giving it and where one knew of his good intentions in this regard) would be an action that in itself would be moral; but to accept an invitation to attend a church would, however, not be necesarrily moral even if one should have been made aware of the fact that the person issuing such an invitation had no ulterior motives for having issued it.<br><br>In fact, the people issuing an invitation to others to attend their church have ABSOLUTELY NO RIGHT WHATSOEVER to take it personally when this invitation of theirs is turned down openly; for in inviting another person to their church, they ought to realise that this person may have conscientious and sincerely felt objections to whatever it is that their church may stand for.<br><br>2) "If this will be done onto you. How would you feel as a Christian?"<br><br>Response:<br><br>If you believe that it would be good for them to attend your church, then their refusal of your invitation ought to fill you with sadness at the prospect of what it may entail for them; on the contrary rather, their refusal of your invitation appears to have induced you to begin feeling sorry for yourself, as if you should have felt yourself personally slighted by their refusal in this regard.<br><br>This very response of yours (that is, the fact that you should be taking it so personally) demonstrates to my mind what a narcissistic and self-absorbed and deluded individual you are.<br><br>3) "You are being self-centered. The reason why they ask you to go is because they are concern about your life. If you think life is about me,myself. Then you are really self-fish. I tell you if your friend don't care about you, they won't ask you go even if you die, they don't even care."<br><br>Response:<br><br>If you don't yourself think that 'life is about you and yourself', then why feel yourself so slighted by their refusal to accept your invitation to them to attend your church?<br><br>It is ridiculous to assume that it is because you care for them, that you have asked them to attend the services of your church.<br><br>How do you know that you care for them?<br><br>I can assure them that Christ cares for them because I believe that He gave His Sacred Blood on the Cross for them (and for me), but I would think twice myself about making grandiose claims about the affection that I supposedly bear them.<br><br>Do you think (as you appear above to have ignorantly implied) that a person's care for someone else is necesarily made manifest in and by an invitation that he issues to this particular person to attend his church?<br><br>I don't deny that if A loves B then it is plausible that A, by way of loving B, would invite B to his church; but I do deny nonetheless that one of the ways in which it would be afforded us enough of a warrant as to be certain that A loves B, is by our seeing A invite B to his church.<br><br>If you can't grasp this basic point, then you are truly pathetic.<br><br>4) "People invite you just go lah, as if it will kill you and asking you to go and NOT asking you to accept their religion. Nobody force you too even for your friend. You think you are so great? Who you think you are, ask you so many times, many of the times are rejected. Ask yourself this question, what for they spend they money and time on you. What benefit do they have? How would you feel when people reject you."<br><br>Reponse:<br><br>Who asked them to 'spend their time and money' on the people they have decided that they should be inviting to their church?<br><br>I'm not sure what 'benefits' they may or may not hope to derive from their evangelistic efforts, but I do know that for a fact that once, someone has been made a part of your church by way of his becoming a member of it, then he is going to be expected to contribute regularly a portion of his monthly income to your church's coffers.<br><br>I don't deny that the people involved in these evangelistic efforts may themselves not profit monetarily from the success of these efforts; but that does not mean that in some other way they may not have already reckoned that by the success of these efforts they should be able to derive a benefit, especially since it is clear that they are greatly inclined take the failure of these efforts in a highly personal fashion.<br><br>In rejecting their inivitation to attend their church, why must they deem this to be a rejection of themselves?<br><br>In any case, since it is a question of an invitation to attend a church, then why should you think that it would be impossible for me to feel conscionably that it would indeed (in a sense) serve to 'kill me to attend your church'?<br><br>What if I feel that Christ compels me to refuse to attend your church?<br><br>And what if I feel that it would be a sin for me to attend your church and to expose myself to teachings and practices that I regard as false and abominable?<br><br>You are so pathetically deluded that I feel that it would be pointless for me to carry on this conversation.<br></div>
