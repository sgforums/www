Tell me if the story is wrong.<br><br>One of my relative's colleague was invited to go the church.  She was made to kneel down and stare at the floor.  They were then asked if they acccept Christ.  She did nothing and someone from behind her force her head down.  Then they claimed that she had accepted Christ and ask her to contribute $50 to the church....<br><br>Don't spam me, I just repeat it for everybody benefit .....</div></blockquote>I second that is not true. I have been to CHC twice or three times recently but they never force me to accept Christ. Or maybe it differs from cell group to cell group and age group? Perhaps your colleague is quite young and looks bulliable.<br><br>About the pastor, I must admit, Kong is rather humorous but frankly speaking, his preaching are pretty shallow and very light on the brain (perhaps thats why many youths are attracted to this church).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Cos some of the parent are quite old-fashion. Saying that Christian cannot do this and that.  The modern concept of people mind is believing and seeing christian as a poor and for the folks to go.  But in CHC is not, we believe GOd wants us to prosper that why we in that church are joyous people and most of them are quite rich. Btw, I don't reveal too much about other church. Some church does not allow to wear .... or read ... because they are demonic. Don't believe can ask your friend.</div>

Maybe not totally but I have the rough idea of what your thinking is.  Different church got different purpose and mission.  Something you don't like does not mean that something they do are wrong.  Think about it, why do some of the churches are dying and instead of having people saved.  The thing CHC does is totally different from other churches.  One of the reason you say/critise them is because you don't understand what they are doing.  You just base on what you see and what you get thoery.  E.g  Why do they worship like worship the devil or whatever.  They aer worshipping <span style="color: red;">a real God</span> and mainly why other churches keep falling and falling is because they cannot feel the pressence.  If you like a girl or a boy, would you tell yourself i love a bit or half., whether a bit of half, ITDOES NOT MATTER.  The truth is you don't love her..  I take another example. Those who go singing or KTV always, do you sing half-dead as if you are dying or you sing with your heart and soul. What would you choose???<br><br>One more thing to say: Some of the thing is just based on what you see is what you get theory.E.g Understanding your parent .  Don't tell you know everything. You can never understand them FULLY. When you say you know everything, actually you know nothing.<br><br></div></blockquote>ha, so the other churches' gods are fake? this is stupid.</div>

We believe in the creation, test and fall of man as recorded in Genesis; his total spiritual depravity and inability to attain to divine righteousness.<br>(Romans 5:12, 1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>4. <strong>We believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, the Savior of men, conceived by the Holy Spirit, born by the Virgin Mary, very God and very Man</strong>.<br>(Luke 1:26-35; John 1:14-18; Isaiah 7:14; 9:6)<br><br>5. We believe Christ died for our sins, was buried and rose again the third day, and personally appeared unto His disciples.<br>(1 Corinthians 15:1-4; Romans 4:25)<br><br>6. We believe in the bodily ascension of Jesus to heaven, His exaltation and personal, literal and bodily coming again the second time for His Church.<br>(John 14:2-3; and 1 Thessalonians 4:13-1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>7. <strong>We believe in the salvation of sinners by grace, through repentance and faith in the perfect and sufficient work of the cross of Calvary by which we obtain remission of sins</strong>.<br>(Ephesians 2:8-9; Hebrews 9:12, 22; Romans 5:11)<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Personal Opinion: Salvation by grace, repentance by faith and works.

We believe in the necessity of water baptism by immersion in the name of the eternal Godhead in order to fulfill the command of the Lord Jesus Christ.<br>(Matthew 28:19; Acts 2:34-36; 19:1-6)<br><br>9. We believe in the baptism in the Holy Spirit as a real experience at or subsequent to salvation, with the scriptural evidence, namely, speaking in other tongues as the Spirit gives utterance.<br>(Acts 2:1-4; 8:14-17; 10:44-45; Galatians 3:14-15)<br><br>10. We believe in the operation of the gifts and ministries of the Spirit as enumerated in 1 Corinthians 12-14 and Ephesians 4, as manifested in the early Church.<br><br>11. We believe in the Spirit-filled life, a life of separation from the world and perfecting of holiness in the fear of God as expressing the true Christian faith.<br>(Ephesians 5:18; 2 Corinthians 6:14; 7:1)<br><br>12. <strong>We believe in the healing of the body by Divine power, or Divine healing in its varied aspects as practised in the early Church (Acts 4:30; Romans 8:11; 1 Corinthians 12:9; James 5:14) and by deliverance in the name of Jesus.</strong><br>(Mark 16:17)<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Personal Opinion: Yes the Church believes in healing, miracles and exorcism.</span><br><br>13. <strong>We believe in the table of the Lord, commonly called the Communion or the Lord's Supper, for believers.</strong><br>(1 Corinthians 11:28-32; Matthew 26:26-2<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>14. <strong>We believe in the reality and personality of the Devil and eternal judgment in the Lake of Fire for the Devil and his angels.</strong><br>(Matthew 25:41; Revelation 20:14-15)<br><br><span style="color: red;"> 15. <strong>We believe in the eternal life for believers (John 5:24 ; 3:16 ), and eternal punishment for the unbelievers.</strong><br>(Mark 9:43-48; 2 Thessalonians 1:9; Revelation 20:10-15)<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Personal Opinion: That settles it, non-believers go to hell - period. Not happy, you can flame, but the statement stands. For one, I didn't even write it.</span></span><br><br>16. <strong>We believe that there is one true universal Church, made up of genuine believers, but this one universal Church is also composed of many local Churches in given localities.</strong> These Churches are under the sovereign headship of the Lord Jesus Christ, exercising autonomous government under Him, administering all its local affairs and ministry, as well as the propagation of the gospel.<br>(Acts 15:22; Matthew 16:18; 18:15-20)<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Personal Opinion: There are many Harvest family Churches in SE Asia, included related/funded orphanages, schools, etc. A large portion of the member's offerings goes into this - not just that building. </span><br><br>17. <strong>We believe that Government is ordained of God, and the powers that be are ordained as ministers of God to us for good.</strong> To resist the powers and the ordinances is to resist the ordinance of God. We are subject not only for wrath sake but for conscience sake, rendering to all their dues, custom to whom custom, fear to whom fear, honor to whom honor. <strong>We declare our loyalty to our Government and its leaders, and will assist in every way possible, consistent with our faith in the scriptures as Christian citizens.</strong><br>(Romans 13)<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Personal Opinion: Romans eh? Yah, someone was wondering how come ISD didn't treat CHC as a cult?</span><br><br>Well, I'm sure this will be useful, whether you are a believer or not, CHC or not, its better that you can put your argument with some substance with understanding of what you are talking about - rather than screaming OMG! THEY ARE BRAINWASHED! OMG! BURN THEM! things like that.[/b]</blockquote>what happens to the muslims and other religions?</div>

Tell me, is this the way to treat a newcomer? My Dad is the IC of our church's FTA(first time attender) ministry, and we all know the basic fact that you give the newcomer the best impression, we are not self centred people, we are God centred people. what is it with comments like "our pastor don't like it'??<br><br>and lastly, are you sure what you said is pleasing to God's eye? seriously, i do not wish to start an argument with you, i just hope you can think about what you are saying, really.<br><br>To the other non-CHCers: pai seh guys, got to talk THEIR language lah, or else cannot get thru to them one :p</div>
