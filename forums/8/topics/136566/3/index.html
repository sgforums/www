            <div class='col-md body'>its kinda strange. a supposed Christian having a nick "libra_gal". Astrology is considered occult by Christians yet you still choose that nick? I suppose your church must have been focusing on the wrong aspects of Christianity then. Its not how much outward supposed show of faith you render unto God that matters, but whether you truly try to follow what is taught in the bible.<br><br>Even though these may seem minor, these seemingly "minor" contradictions would lead to more people thinking Christians are hypocrites, hindering the evangelistic movement.<br><br>just my 2 cents worth...</div>

They have become disgusting and are more like poseurs than christians. do you see monks coming up to you to ask you to become a buddhist? i dont see the reverends preaching on the roads.. giving fliers etc. i dont see muslims giving out fliers about allah or even people of other religions trying to get more people to believe in their religion. It is disgusting to see people pestering others to become a christian, especially at places like bus-stops outside schools.. and etc where they target the teens nowadays. Plus, there have been many theories and scientific explanations that disprove christianity. The bible was written by man, is it not? the bible is historical.. is it not? History is always written by the winners. In the olden times, the winners are always depicted as the victors in war, which means, they can twist and turn facts.. and do as they wish. Studying science itself is already being untruthful to God.<br><br>i went to CHC once and there was this "healing event".. He Yao San was there and she was one of the main pastors etc etc...  i find the healing sessions extremely fake, and too hard to believe.. im not trying to discourage people from believing it.. but please share your thoughts as well</div></blockquote>+1  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

If what they know is not the true gospel, they won't want to be involved in any christian activity in any church, unless they go for ulterior motive.<br><br>It is a bit like MLM. Many people have misconceptions and loathe joining the scheme. Then after they join, earn $$ liao, then change their mindset .. haha .. if mlm is conceived as pyramid selling, you think people will want to join?</div></blockquote>earn money? i dont see myself earning money when i went to church last time. lol.. and what is mlm? but in any case, i believe that if someone wants to become a christian, he/she will definitely go to church. If someone wants to be a muslim, he/she will go to the mosque.</div>
