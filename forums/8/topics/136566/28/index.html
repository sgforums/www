            <div class='col-md body'>Hi I am a free-thinker who respects all religions of Singapore. I have friends who are muslims, buddhists, taoists, christians and catholics, etc.<br><br>But with regards to CHC, I have reservations bout it. My 2 good friends, who were once Taoists, went to CHC and were subsequently converted.<br>Their grades suffer, from originally straight As to straight Cs grades. When I asked them what happened, they replied that they were busy with their CHC activities. Of course, they often encouraged me to attend although I have repeatedly rejected going.<br><br>Their mentality have also changed... for the worse. Whenever we have any discussions, they will always attribute to God, etc. Challenging Darwin's Theory of Evolution is alrite, afterall Science always allows discussion and arguments. But what strike me was that they rebutted the theory without giving any explanations and that the God in their eyes must always be correct and that any theories that are raised to challenge their stance on God will be deemed insensitive, untrue, disrespect. They also "advised" me that whatever science has done throughout these years is evil since it "discredit" God. Even if others chip in with the discussions and provide very reasonable explanations, my 2 good frends will very quickly de-bunk it as long as God is not mentioned. Call them naive or brainwashed? My other Christian friends at least have provided far more insight and more opinions instead of mentioning God whenever their arguments cannot stand up to scrutiny.<br><br>One thing that really disgusts me was when 3 CHC members surrounded me and trying to "preach" their teachings, forcefully asking me to take their phamplets, and denouncing other religions as "childish" and "un-true". I just pushed them away and right in front of their eyes, just throw the phamplets into the dustbins.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>As for being $$ minded, its a fact. All CHC members out there, please do admit that you all have donated a lot of $$ as compared to other churches. And that the building is by far the most impressive compared to other churches in Singapore. I heard from my frends that during the annual meeting, the first thing they discussed is $$ matters. Why is it that other churches are not practising what CHC is doing? And more importantly, why are there so many christians who are anti-CHC? According to my Christian friends who attended CHC once or twice, they spent more time dancing and collecting $$ than preaching.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>By of course, if you want girls, its best to go CHC.
