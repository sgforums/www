Funds wise, the government can't do anything. I think.<br><br>also, we don't for sure of how much percentage of the money really goes to church staff. But if the church members really want to move into town area, it's no wonder they need the large funds. If anything, I'd say their guilty of being lavish.</div>

So long as the number coming in is greater than those going out, it doesn't matter if ppl really want to leave.</div>
