            <div class='col-md body'>Okay. I was participating in another forum in a discussion on Christianity with non-believers. I am in agreement with MrBach on the issue of judgment. Let me elaborate more on this with some of my points.<br><br><strong>False Teachings</strong><br>There are many warnings found in the Bible that show some people would try to promote false teachings and lead people away from the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><ol type="1">[*]"Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves." (Matthew 7:15)<br>[*]"and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people." (Matthew 24:11)<br>[*]"For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and miracles to deceive even the electÂ—if that were possible." (Matthew 24:24)<br>[*]"For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, masquerading as apostles of Christ. And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light.It is not surprising, then, if his servants masquerade as servants of righteousness. Their end will be what their actions deserve." (2 Corinthians 11:13-15)<br>[*]"But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord who bought them--bringing swift destruction on themselves." (2 Peter 2:1)<br>[*]"Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world." (1 John 4:1)<br></ol><strong>Judgment</strong><br>One of the most misinterpreted Bible verses is Matthew 7:1-2. It is written: "Do not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you." What many fail to realize is that it is a warning against hypocritical judgment. It is not against judgment per se.<br><br>In many parts of the Bible, Christians are called to judge and to discern between right and wrong teachings, as well as to discern between true and false prophets. In Luke 7:43, Jesus said: "You have judged correctly." And in 1 Corinthians 10:15, "I speak to sensible people; judge for yourselves what I say." The original Greek word krinō, which means to judge, is used in Matthew 7:1-2, Luke 7:43 and 1 Corinthians 10:15.<br><br>In 1 John 4:1, it is written: "Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world." Ephesians 5:11 says, "Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them." In 1 Thessalonians 5:21, it is written: "Test everything. Hold on to the good."<br><br>If we Christians are to obey these Biblical teachings, then we are to judge. It would be impossible to do so without judging.<br><br><strong>Background &amp; Exhortation</strong><br>I have been in a pro-charismatic church for many years and I believe I have an idea of what the City Harvesters are going through. The rule of worship should not be determined by how you think or what Kong Hee says. The rule of worship is found in the Bible. The Bible should be your only guide in respect to  your  behavior as a Christian. If you do not follow what the Bible prescribed, you will be guilty of mocking God in your worship. Therefore, please tread carefully.<br><br>Please keep this saying in mind, "Soli Deo Gloria," which means all glory to God alone. Worship should be God-centered, not Man-centered. It is not City Harvest Church that converts the unbelievers. It is God who works through the preaching of the Biblical gospel of Jesus Christ. Preach the gospel, not preach City Harvest.<br><br>To the City Harvesters, it is very important that you study the Bible carefully and test the teachings of Kong Hee against what the Bible says. Follow what the Bereans did in Acts 17:11. Read the Bible in context, making sure that those teachings by Kong Hee are not contradicted by other parts of the Bible. I have read for myself Kong Hee's teachings and have discovered many theological contextual mistakes that should not have been committed by a pastor at Kong Hee's level. Therefore, I hope you will seriously study the Word of God and see what the rest of us Bible-believing Christians see.</div>

You are totally judgemental, bordering on hypocrisy.  There's nothing wrong with Sun singing.
