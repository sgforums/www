            <div class='col-md body'>I understand how your feel and your yr think. Maybe not totally but I have the rough idea of what your thinking is.  Different church got different purpose and mission.  Something you don't like does not mean that something they do are wrong.  Think about it, why do some of the churches are dying and instead of having people saved.  The thing CHC does is totally different from other churches.  One of the reason you say/critise them is because you don't understand what they are doing.  You just base on what you see and what you get thoery.  E.g  Why do they worship like worship the devil or whatever.  They aer worshipping a real God and mainly why other churches keep falling and falling is because they cannot feel the pressence.  If you like a girl or a boy, would you tell yourself i love a bit or half., whether a bit of half, ITDOES NOT MATTER.  The truth is you don't love her..  I take another example. Those who go singing or KTV always, do you sing half-dead as if you are dying or you sing with your heart and soul. What would you choose???<br><br>One more thing to say: Some of the thing is just based on what you see is what you get theory.E.g Understanding your parent .  Don't tell you know everything. You can never understand them FULLY. When you say you know everything, actually you know nothing.<br><br></div>

If you like a girl or a boy, would you tell yourself i love a bit or half., whether a bit of half, ITDOES NOT MATTER.  The truth is you don't love her?<br><br>what kinda analogy is this. If i love a girl, of course i love her, if i love her abit of course i love her abit. what do you mean it does not matter, if i love her even abit, it means i have some love for her, how can the truth be i dont love her?<br><br>6.E.g Understanding your parent .  Don't tell you know everything. You can never understand them FULLY. When you say you know everything, actually you know nothing.?<br><br>this is some serious horse shiet right there. how can you not know nothing about your parents after having lived your whole life with them.<br><br>to sum it all up, i think you have some serious issues and need to spend more time thinking before u start posting<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>also, please dont say i do not weigh the pros and cons, you may find it hard to believe but i do read the bible. that is because the "events" that took place in the bible have values for all to learn. Ultimately, if you narrow down every religion, it is to help nurture and mould any individual into a better person. the goals are definitely the same, but its the path that is different.</div>
