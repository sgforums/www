Does it mean christians would not be cheated by monks, since they obviously don't believe? ah ha .. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><blockquote>Overall your inaptness to understand the phrase 'I dont believe in God' is very taxing. I wouldn't want to elaborate on how a person cannot conceive such a simple notion. It has to do with his mental strength.</blockquote>you werent very clear to begin with. Well, at least ben agrees with this.<br><br>your posts are just flaming christians and bashing their god. Worthless piece of trash, I would say.</div>
