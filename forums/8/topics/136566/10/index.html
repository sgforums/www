Hwat I was saying was to those who said they just THROW the postcard away when his/friend gave to them. What does it show.<br><br>Of course, we don't force people to go if they really don't want to.  City Harvest Church is a charismatic church. The way MANY of them do is about the same but don't take it as a force or a pressuring things to go. WE DO NOT FORCE PEOPLE TO GO. I agree, some may be a bit pestering.<br><br>REMEMBER we do not want your sympathy kind of money. If you want to give this kind of money, then they will not accept even if you give $10 or $1000. We want people who will give willingly.  The money they gave is not for them but for GOD.  We use a these funds to build church,school,hospital in other countries such as Banda Ache &amp; Malaysia.<br><br>You may be know the goodness in it. When you know it, ou may think it ortherwise.  I am not trying to change your mindset but to explain why and how the things we do.<br><br>We are imperfect people including people.  So don't think that CHC people should be a perfect people and set an example for others.  We are all human, we do sin also.<br><br>Whoever seen a CHC member take a gun or knife to force people to go. Never right. You want or don't want to go is up to you. It's your decision.  One of CHC goal, to take the nation by storm and to be a whole new generation for them.<br>You may not agree but you cannot stop they way they do.  They do is not because they want to be yaya-papaya or what, they just want to do good thing for GOD.  How many peoples here think that CHC will not be able to build a builing in 1998(Economic Slump).  Maybe you thought of that right, but we proved it wrong, not by the work of man but by the words of GOd.</div></blockquote>can you quote me any verse from the bible that actually justifies or sanctions these ambitious aspirations and extravaggant actions?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> or are you just trying to turn singapore into a mega-chc colony?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Offerings can be given when during e service by putting it into e envelope.. Offering dun have to write name coz u give on yr free will.. But tithing is once a month.. If every member in tat church tithe by putting it in e envelope given &amp; imagine hw many particulars does e accounts dept need to key in &amp; print it out b4 distributing to e members whom had tithe? The machines are to reduce e work load of the accounts dept..<br><br><strong>n a singer who calls herself a pastor,who obviously doesn't have much moral values, n a bunch of believer who say they love god but have idol worship.. seriously, ppl from city harvest call themselves christians but the idolise ho yao sun..</strong><br><br>Pastor Ho had her own passion tats singing.. &amp; since she's given an opportunity to sing as an career, who wouldn't want? &amp; through this career she could do her part in church too.. If u say tat every member in e church is her fans then u r wronged.. We worshipped e mighty God above &amp; not her.. We idolised our Mighty GOd &amp; Jesus Christ but not her.. We looked up to her bcoz she had shown us e work of God in her.. Not bcoz she is a singer.. We love God from e bottom of our heart which dun need to be seen by u coz u r not God..</div>

Its e fact some people goes to church with some purposes.. Its true tat some people out there treats CHC as a match-making centre.. But through her msg, I could c tat she's trying to tell them tat CHC is built for e purpose of worhipping God &amp; not other purposes which they could think of.. Shdn't we tell them wat is e purpose of building a church instead of we having some misunderstandings with each other? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
