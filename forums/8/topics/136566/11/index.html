            <div class='col-md body'>To Mc@ square:  I agree that the usher may sound a bit unfriendly, but you also have to know that being an useher is not easy too. I get offended by them also but we must forgive and forget.<br><br>To keeth: I DID NOT SAID YOU CANNOT REJECT INVITAION, but please have some kind of courtesy by not throwing the postcards away.  It takes for time and effort for them to give and write it to you.  If you don't want , just tell them. I am sure they will gradly not give it to you and instead they will give it to some one else. It's just a present, when someone give it to you, do you throw away.<br><br>To Mr Bach: ONCE AGAIN, i don't I have said how many times that I did not said you cannot invitation. You see, I don't how many times must I emphase it.  4th point: We do not force them to give, how many times must I say that also? Sorry, no offense.<br><br>To Ogbunwezeh:  We are still young, they are a lot of things they still don't understand.<br><br>To laurence82:  We don't lose anything, it is your life not my life. We don need your pathetic money. You can keep those money instead.  Church is a house of God not market place. If you want to talk about the maketplace, please go to marketplace and talk.<br><br>To Yunhaier: That is why we do not encourage chrictian and non-christian together. They will have a lof of conflict. It's not totally her fault.  This is a religion, you don't convert because his girlfriend ask him to.  Is a personal decision.<br><br>To snk86: What other people does I don't really want to know.Since you saw it already.How would you think?  Is it nice for it to have people walking hear and there while the pastor is preaching??? One more thing, on behalf of the usher I apologise to you.  Usher got to do their job too. I understand your agony, I face it before so I can relate much of your feeling.  What I can say is forgive and forget .<br><br>To coffeeortea: you are using a wrong example. You mention abour food. You yourself should know that food will go bad in a few days. What about postcards. 2nd point  Don't confuse FORCE and PESTER. Force is an action being done to another person without feeling about how he feel Pester is by the way a person trying to persuade another person.  IT IS YOUR DECISION. 3rd point Of course no churches done that but do look at the previous post, some say that we want 10% of their money, is a compulsory thing.  If I don't say that will you know??? 4th I DID NOT say that by going CHC will become more perfect person.  It's just the way we do that may go against some people. 5th I did say it will take the nation by storm. Please, I don't mean it god really use storm to make to become CHristian.  That is why I say a lot of things that WE DO, you will not understand.  What I mean is that, we will grow as never before and some of the people will be shocked by the things we do.<br><br>To:laurence82 Hey, what are you trying to say. You want Christian and Catholics to have conflict??<br><br>To:giggs011  AS I HAVE SAID, they did not brainwash those people, can;t to get this simple therory right. You ask those who went CHC before and left. Are they being washbrain a not. You won't understand one.<br><br>To macjoe: You have discern which church teaches the right things. I cannot tell you that. yOu may wish to ind out from your friends.<br><br>To _attitude_: Hey, I seriouly hate your this kind of attitude. Who are you to call brunch of freaks.  If you don't like, just keep quiet.  They do not have idol worship.  Frankly speaking, I don't buy her album like those idol.  I never buy her album, so don't think that they will worship her like those idol you seen.<br><br>To summarise everything, some of your might not like the way they do, behave, speak, reply etc.... Have you ever think that, did they crtisize about your, talk something bad about your? How do you feel.  As for other-christian , you may not like it, just accept it. What is the point of helping the non-believer to cast stones on CHC.  It makes not different between you and them.  As for non-believer, the way CHC does have it's own purpose, how many times you go there. How well do you know and their doing? Simple thing like thithing kind of things can make your misunderstood, how much do you really know about other thing.  I am not here to pick a fight with your but to speak the truth out of it. If you find the answer I gave may be harsh, please don't get offended. Kindly drop out of this topic. I really don't want to find fault with yout or you find problem with me....<br><br></div>

I get offended by them also but we must forgive and forget.<br><br>To keeth: I DID NOT SAID YOU CANNOT REJECT INVITAION, but please have some kind of courtesy by not throwing the postcards away.  It takes for time and effort for them to give and write it to you.  If you don't want , just tell them. I am sure they will gradly not give it to you and instead they will give it to some one else. It's just a present, when someone give it to you, do you throw away.<br><br>To Mr Bach: ONCE AGAIN, i don't I have said how many times that I did not said you cannot invitation. You see, I don't how many times must I emphase it.  4th point: We do not force them to give, how many times must I say that also? Sorry, no offense.<br><br>To Ogbunwezeh:  We are still young, they are a lot of things they still don't understand.<br><br>To laurence82:  We don't lose anything, it is your life not my life. We don need your pathetic money. You can keep those money instead.  Church is a house of God not market place. If you want to talk about the maketplace, please go to marketplace and talk.<br><br>To Yunhaier: That is why we do not encourage chrictian and non-christian together. They will have a lof of conflict. It's not totally her fault.  This is a religion, you don't convert because his girlfriend ask him to.  Is a personal decision.<br><br>To snk86: What other people does I don't really want to know.Since you saw it already.How would you think?  Is it nice for it to have people walking hear and there while the pastor is preaching??? One more thing, on behalf of the usher I apologise to you.  Usher got to do their job too. I understand your agony, I face it before so I can relate much of your feeling.  What I can say is forgive and forget .<br><br>To coffeeortea: you are using a wrong example. You mention abour food. You yourself should know that food will go bad in a few days. What about postcards. 2nd point  Don't confuse FORCE and PESTER. Force is an action being done to another person without feeling about how he feel Pester is by the way a person trying to persuade another person.  IT IS YOUR DECISION. 3rd point Of course no churches done that but do look at the previous post, some say that we want 10% of their money, is a compulsory thing.  If I don't say that will you know??? 4th I DID NOT say that by going CHC will become more perfect person.  It's just the way we do that may go against some people. 5th I did say it will take the nation by storm. Please, I don't mean it god really use storm to make to become CHristian.  That is why I say a lot of things that WE DO, you will not understand.  What I mean is that, we will grow as never before and some of the people will be shocked by the things we do.<br><br>To:laurence82 Hey, what are you trying to say. You want Christian and Catholics to have conflict??<br><br>To:giggs011  AS I HAVE SAID, they did not brainwash those people, can;t to get this simple therory right. You ask those who went CHC before and left. Are they being washbrain a not. You won't understand one.<br><br>To macjoe: You have discern which church teaches the right things. I cannot tell you that. yOu may wish to ind out from your friends.<br><br>To _attitude_: Hey, I seriouly hate your this kind of attitude. Who are you to call brunch of freaks.  If you don't like, just keep quiet.  They do not have idol worship.  Frankly speaking, I don't buy her album like those idol.  I never buy her album, so don't think that they will worship her like those idol you seen.<br><br>To summarise everything, some of your might not like the way they do, behave, speak, reply etc.... Have you ever think that, did they crtisize about your, talk something bad about your? How do you feel.  As for other-christian , you may not like it, just accept it. What is the point of helping the non-believer to cast stones on CHC.  It makes not different between you and them.  As for non-believer, the way CHC does have it's own purpose, how many times you go there. How well do you know and their doing? Simple thing like thithing kind of things can make your misunderstood, how much do you really know about other thing.  I am not here to pick a fight with your but to speak the truth out of it. If you find the answer I gave may be harsh, please don't get offended. Kindly drop out of this topic. I really don't want to find fault with yout or you find problem with me....<br><br></div></blockquote>Already some extreme Christians in Eternal Hope have been lambasted for their poor attitude and extremist thinkings.<br><br>If i were to go to church and end with an attitude like yours, I wouldnt want to be there.<br><br>In fact, i dont think your church seriously preach humility. Look at your haughty statement on accepting people's 'pathetic money'  Why also avoid the issue and talk about the marketplace when the issue is on the integrity of your church treasurers?<br><br>Also, I mean it when I say the Catholics are the better lot. Altho I dont agree on their ideas on contraception and abortion, their conservativeness and less extreme form of evangelism are heck lot better than most Protestant churches.<br><br>Dont get into politics and talk abt creating conflicts between Catholics and Protestants, when the issue is on how different are these two groups on evangelism.</div>

Instead of finding out who may be the culprits in CHC who may be doing those, or whether these experiences are fake, you choose ask people not to criticise. People are arguing over facts and experiences here, you want to appeal to emotions of people? Geez...<br><br>And dont use Christian brotherhood as a tool to some sort of creating conflicts between non believers and believers. This is manipulation at its nastiest. Many of these Christians who posted here are either the learned ones or have enough experiences and knowledge to question on CHC teachings on Christianity. Obviously, they see sumthing that are contrary to Christ teachings or blasphemous here. And you simply ask them to accept it, and not to help non-believers to criticise you guys?<br><br>Sheesh</div>
