            <div class='col-md body'>What is the point of christianity? It seems to be a religion that exists for its own sake, not like buddhism which is more focused on helping the people around us, improving the lot of people around us and generally spreading harmony? I FEEL that christianity is quite a pointless religion leh....just worship god and pledge your love or whatever.<br><br>If you have time, just go to skepdic.com and read some of the articles there lor....very interesting. Anyway I got some of my questions from there-<br><br>1) why does God need to be worshipped? why does he want to be worshipped?<br><br>2) why is god kind, benevolent, loving? why is god good? To say that god is good is judging him, and thus insulting him, isn't it?<br><br>3) why does God even bother with us? He created a universe with infinite boundaries and even Earth has billions of different species of organisms. What makes us the chosen people, the chosen race, the chosen group just because we have performed better in evolution?<br>I believe god is simply a source of energy that created the universe, not a spiritual and thinking entity.<br><br>4) why does christians always harp on their faith for no reason, even when talking to non-christians? There are two CHC girls in my class, who always say 'god will help, he is with me' when I ask them whether they studied for their test, or how their preparations for their CCA competitions were going. In the end, everything they do is like shit, only know how to say that "in the end, God will help me"    I say that it's crap and they can rely on god's power to pass their a levels this year for all I care. Don't study expect "GOD" to help them pass...what Â£"*Â£%"[/quote][/i]</div>

You know is not for us nor the pastor but for the building and missionaries.  NOBODY FORCE YOU TO GIVE. It's you own willing heart .  If you don't like who or what, just keep quiet.  Nobody will say you are deaf or what. I myself also nv buy her album.  So what this mean. We are being brainwash to give and give or support whatever they are doing.  WE as a human have many different personalities.  Some you like some you don't like.  Church is also the same.  why the church is growing and not getting smaller. Don't use stupid reason like being brainwash or what.<br><br>Faith is something that bare eyes can't see but you believe.  You can ask around or do a survey asking how many millionaire are christian.  CHC nv force people to go. Do they take a knife or say some curses that if you don't go they will kill you or curses you.  If you are not interested or don't like, fine.  Speak in a polite way.<br><br>I also have been approached my other church people to ask me join this church or that church. Btw, CHC used to do that but this time they do not approach ANY stranger to join. I also say I am not interested. No chruch is perfect. You think the building in CHC is free of charge ah.  Just think how much they have spent on it. Btw, is not for your to see.  Is for people to worship there.</div>

If you don't like who or what, just keep quiet.  Nobody will say you are deaf or what. I myself also nv buy her album.  So what this mean. We are being brainwash to give and give or support whatever they are doing.  WE as a human have many different personalities.  Some you like some you don't like.  Church is also the same.  why the church is growing and not getting smaller. Don't use stupid reason like being brainwash or what.<br><br>Faith is something that bare eyes can't see but you believe.  You can ask around or do a survey asking how many millionaire are christian.  CHC nv force people to go. Do they take a knife or say some curses that if you don't go they will kill you or curses you.  If you are not interested or don't like, fine.  Speak in a polite way.<br><br>I also have been approached my other church people to ask me join this church or that church. Btw, CHC used to do that but this time they do not approach ANY stranger to join. I also say I am not interested. No chruch is perfect. You think the building in CHC is free of charge ah.  Just think how much they have spent on it. Btw, is not for your to see.  Is for people to worship there.  </div></blockquote>Welcome to sgForums - the place of crazy critics, chc flamers and hys haters.<br><br>Anyways..<br><br>CHC Official Statement of Faith:<br><br>The fundamental teachings of this congregation are reflected in the following clear statements of faith:<br><br>1. We believe in the plenary-verbal inspiration of the accepted canon of scriptures as originally given. <strong>The scriptures are infallible, inerrant and the sole and final authority for all matters of faith and conduct</strong>.<br>(2 Timothy 3:16; 1 Corinthians 2:13)<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Personal Opinion: Please note that it says ".. accepted canon of scriptures as originally given."</span><br><br>2. We believe in the eternal Godhead who has revealed Himself as <strong>one God existing in three persons, Father, Son and Holy Spirit</strong>, distinguishable but indivisible.<br>(Matthew 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14)<br><br>3. We believe in the creation, test and fall of man as recorded in Genesis; his total spiritual depravity and inability to attain to divine righteousness.<br>(Romans 5:12, 1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>4. <strong>We believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, the Savior of men, conceived by the Holy Spirit, born by the Virgin Mary, very God and very Man</strong>.<br>(Luke 1:26-35; John 1:14-18; Isaiah 7:14; 9:6)<br><br>5. We believe Christ died for our sins, was buried and rose again the third day, and personally appeared unto His disciples.<br>(1 Corinthians 15:1-4; Romans 4:25)<br><br>6. We believe in the bodily ascension of Jesus to heaven, His exaltation and personal, literal and bodily coming again the second time for His Church.<br>(John 14:2-3; and 1 Thessalonians 4:13-1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>7. <strong>We believe in the salvation of sinners by grace, through repentance and faith in the perfect and sufficient work of the cross of Calvary by which we obtain remission of sins</strong>.<br>(Ephesians 2:8-9; Hebrews 9:12, 22; Romans 5:11)<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Personal Opinion: Salvation by grace, repentance by faith and works. Simple enough?</span><br><br>8. We believe in the necessity of water baptism by immersion in the name of the eternal Godhead in order to fulfill the command of the Lord Jesus Christ.<br>(Matthew 28:19; Acts 2:34-36; 19:1-6)<br><br>9. We believe in the baptism in the Holy Spirit as a real experience at or subsequent to salvation, with the scriptural evidence, namely, speaking in other tongues as the Spirit gives utterance.<br>(Acts 2:1-4; 8:14-17; 10:44-45; Galatians 3:14-15)<br><br>10. We believe in the operation of the gifts and ministries of the Spirit as enumerated in 1 Corinthians 12-14 and Ephesians 4, as manifested in the early Church.<br><br>11. We believe in the Spirit-filled life, a life of separation from the world and perfecting of holiness in the fear of God as expressing the true Christian faith.<br>(Ephesians 5:18; 2 Corinthians 6:14; 7:1)<br><br>12. <strong>We believe in the healing of the body by Divine power, or Divine healing in its varied aspects as practised in the early Church (Acts 4:30; Romans 8:11; 1 Corinthians 12:9; James 5:14) and by deliverance in the name of Jesus.</strong><br>(Mark 16:17)<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Personal Opinion: Yes the Church believes in healing, miracles and exorcism.</span><br><br>13. <strong>We believe in the table of the Lord, commonly called the Communion or the Lord's Supper, for believers.</strong><br>(1 Corinthians 11:28-32; Matthew 26:26-2<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>14. <strong>We believe in the reality and personality of the Devil and eternal judgment in the Lake of Fire for the Devil and his angels.</strong><br>(Matthew 25:41; Revelation 20:14-15)<br><br>15. <strong>We believe in the eternal life for believers (John 5:24 ; 3:16 ), and eternal punishment for the unbelievers.</strong><br>(Mark 9:43-48; 2 Thessalonians 1:9; Revelation 20:10-15)<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Personal Opinion: That settles it, non-believers go to hell - period. Not happy, you can flame, but the statement stands. For one, I didn't even write it.</span><br><br>16. <strong>We believe that there is one true universal Church, made up of genuine believers, but this one universal Church is also composed of many local Churches in given localities.</strong> These Churches are under the sovereign headship of the Lord Jesus Christ, exercising autonomous government under Him, administering all its local affairs and ministry, as well as the propagation of the gospel.<br>(Acts 15:22; Matthew 16:18; 18:15-20)<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Personal Opinion: There are many Harvest family Churches in SE Asia, included related/funded orphanages, schools, etc. A large portion of the member's offerings goes into this - not just that building. </span><br><br>17. <strong>We believe that Government is ordained of God, and the powers that be are ordained as ministers of God to us for good.</strong> To resist the powers and the ordinances is to resist the ordinance of God. We are subject not only for wrath sake but for conscience sake, rendering to all their dues, custom to whom custom, fear to whom fear, honor to whom honor. <strong>We declare our loyalty to our Government and its leaders, and will assist in every way possible, consistent with our faith in the scriptures as Christian citizens.</strong><br>(Romans 13)<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Personal Opinion: Romans eh? Yah, someone was wondering how come ISD didn't treat CHC as a cult?</span><br><br>Well, I'm sure this will be useful, whether you are a believer or not, CHC or not, its better that you can put your argument with some substance with understanding of what you are talking about - rather than screaming OMG! THEY ARE BRAINWASHED! OMG! BURN THEM! things like that.</div>
