            <div class='col-md body'>well obviously this thread is not closed as yet. heh.<br><br>anyways, just my simple point of view on CHC:<br><br>1. I don't get the point of building such a grand church. Isn't church supposed to be a community for fellow worshippers? I have a friend who is in CHC and I asked her whether she knows this guy from CHC and the reply was "I don't know. the church is so big." Doesn't this defeat the meaning of the word "community"? In this sense CHC is not a community anymore, whereas it's just a big building for many worshippers. Correct me if I'm wrong.<br><br>2. The funds involved in building the present-day CHC is ridiculous. I don't understand the need for such a big building. Shouldn't the funds be channelled into charitable organisations?<br><br>3. I simply REFUSE to believe the notion that CHC people DO NOT try to invite people to CHC. Heck the objective of building such a big church is to attract more people in the first place. Don't give me bullshit about appearances being material because in the first place, the point of building a big building is to accomodate more people. And we have just about more than enough evidences here from fellow forumers about CHC people "inviting" others to join CHC.<br><br>4. This is just a rumour, do correct me if I'm wrong. I've had heard rumours about CHC asking for 2nd round offerings. I hope this is false because if it's true, it really reflects the workings of CHC as a whole.<br><br>All in all, this is just my humble point of view(s). The reason behind me doubting CHC in the first place is because we haven't seen or heard sufficient or satisfactory explanation from the church itself. Just like this thread, the replies from CHC worshippers are either out-of-point, or simply disregarding the questions we posted in the first place.<br><br>Is there really a need to escape our doubts? Or is it just that you simply have no clarification?</div>

It's none of my affair to worry about how they spend on their holy place and their pastors.<br><br>However, I would rather they keep to themselves their way of life instead of meddling in others' affair. Their invitation should not be forced, nor should they comment on others' faith unless the others were interested and asked about their religion.<br><br>I have no qualms about Christianity, their practices as long they do not put their damn flyers into our mailboxes, our gates because I am never interested.<br><br>They should stop reaching out to people in the train station trying to say a whole load of rubbish and should wear a tag that goes, "If you want to know about God ask me."<br><br>I'm ok if they stand their with their big bright tags as long as they don't ask me to give them time.
