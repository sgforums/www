            <div class='col-md body'>I guess over the years the Zoo has become like a national institution and its just sad that they just went ahead and changed to logo without even asking for our opinion. Its almost like renaming Sentosa to something else just because it sounded cooler. Short of signing a petition to review the logo or hoping the media picks up on this, all we can do is just sit here and feel sad for the misbranded animals. What they gave is a typical stock answer that doens't really address the issue of many people not liking the new logo. We understand the need for rebranding but perhaps they could be more responsible to the public regarding such a major change.</div>

However, as part of Wildlife Reserves Singapore's (WRS) plans to refresh its parks' appeal, alongside upgrading of facilities it has undertaken the redesigning of the logos of Singapore Zoo and Jurong BirdPark.<br><br>This matter was discussed extensively by WRS Board members and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the advertising agency who is familiar with our parks, was given a brief to undertake the design. We all know that logos are a subjective matter, often with some who like it and can relate to it and some who don't. So it was rather remarkable that the Singapore Zoo logo was unanimously endorsed by the Board recently. For Singapore Zoo, the move towards a more contemporary, typography style is aimed towards catering to a broader appeal amongst all age groups and not just the young. Historically, it has also been demonstrated that typographical logos withstand the test of time and is more enduring. For the Zoo, such a typography style also facilitates ease of applications for our wide variety of retail and merchandise items.<br><br>We are taking a phased-in approach for the logo change. Except for the major signage like those at the entrance and new advertising and collateral, the former logo on collateral will be replaced with the new logo only when we're doing a new reprint, thereby rendering it unnecessary to have additional budgets for the change.<br><br>Thanks again for taking the time to share your comments with us and allowing us the opportunity to clarify the matter.<br><br>Yours sincerely,<br>Pauline Tan<br>Corporate Communications<br>Singapore Zoo &amp; Night Safari<br><br>Seems like they really value their board's opinion over the mass opinion and also their board seems out of touch or have been pretty much blinded by the sales pitch of their Marketing Agency.</div></blockquote>Saatchi and Saatch???<br><br>I know for sure...it's not cheap for Saatchi and Saatchi to design the logo.<br><br>I didn't know S &amp; S is familiar with the zoo.  But I sure know they were engaged by the Mcdonalds.  After the McDonalds team "migrate" to the zoo, they brought S &amp; S along.</div>
