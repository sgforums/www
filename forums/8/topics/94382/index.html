            <div class='col-md body'>I try to entertain the drivers as much as possible. I am usually not very communicable to cab drivers. What is really bad is taxi drivers who think they know where YOU want go or correct you when you state your destination. One time, a driver insisted that the place I wanted to go to is NOT at the street I directed him to... later he was proven wrong and was so embarrassed. All I said then, was, I know where I am going, I have worked here for the past 5 years.<br><br>Another one tried to preach to me Christianity, even though I already insisted that I already know the Gospel.... longest half an hour I'd ever encountered.<br><br>Others play religious music, like Buddhist chants via their tape player. I am too polite to tell them to shut it down....<br><br>Sigh..</div>
