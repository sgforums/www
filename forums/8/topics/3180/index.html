            <div class='col-md body'>What's it with NS and Girlfriends.<br><br>Ever noticed one thing, especially for those guys who have just enlisted?<br><br>You call your girl out only once a week. There and then, she gets bored by seeing you once a week and gives those silly excuses of being very busy. Soon or later, these outings get less and less frequent. And out of the blue, she says she wants to break up with you as she had found another guy better than you (doesn't tell u directly of course).<br><br>For those who had just been enlisted, just POP or just after your Trade Course and had JUST gotten a stead b4 u were enlisted. Better watch out for warning signs...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Problems start to surface when there is a sudden change in a relationship, if the person doesn't like the change and refuses to adept to the changes he or she will most likely to source out an alternative solution to continue on with their regular lifestyles. It takes alot of committment to actually stick to one person in a steady relationship, alot of relationships dont last and the problem lies again with the committment factor. Roughly categorizing the kinds of people that i have came across, I have came up with a few sets but i'll just mention the category your stead probably falls into<br><br>1. The emotional "high" type: They'll do anything for you as long as they get some love in return for their acts, they like to get emotionally involved where the other half showers you with care tender and concern. Their lust for love (the emotion type of love) is extremely high. Becareful, because if you negject them the next moment you know they are two timing you but keeps you in the dark.<br><br>Its just a analysis and you don't have to agree with me if you choose not to.<br>Llyn's 2 cents.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here's another thread on NS again. And I guess i'll pose my same attitude as before.<br><br>I myself did have a gf before i entered army. She was everything to me, but during the 2 and 1/2 weeks confinement...our relationship became quite bad. Thereafter, i only get to see her once a week, which made things even much worse.<br><br>Somehow...i felt that she's better off without me giving her so much problems, thus we ended our relationship 1 week just before i POP from bmt.<br><br>NS is a waste of time.
