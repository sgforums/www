            <div class='col-md body'>Compromise. Everything in our lives presents us with opportunities to compromise. Relationships. Work. Shopping. Friends. Apartments. Even Pets. Everything is a game of give and take. What will I give up in exchange for what you are willing to give up? At what point will I settle, even if itÂ’s not exactly what I want? ThatÂ’s the point really.<br><br>Compromise is the act of lowering your own standards so that someone else can meet them. ItÂ’s selective acceptance. Our personal standards allow us to easily and carelessly dismiss anything we see which may be sub-par in our minds. However, every standard has a compromising point. He ins't as sensitive as I'd like but he has rock hard abs. Her face isnÂ’t that pretty, but sheÂ’s got a great body. HeÂ’s not the most talkative and intelligent guy, but heÂ’s drop dead gorgeous. Her butt is a little big, but sheÂ’s got the most beautiful eyes. You get the idea.<br><br>Before you start cursing me and calling me superficial, donÂ’t forget, IÂ’m not just talking about ME here. IÂ’m talking about ALL of us. Yes. Even you. IÂ’m not joking. Even your own precious standards are capable of being compromised far more easily than you think. Take an honest look at your past and IÂ’m sure you will find endless incidents of your own willingness to compromise your standards in exchange for immediate gratification.<br><br>But what does all this compromising get us?<br><br>Short term satisfactions followed by long term disappointments. Compromising your standards could certainly help get past any immediate roadblocks to satisfaction. But over time, the compromises we make become more difficult to live with. The things we could ignore so easily in the past fester and grow into behemoth issues within us. No compromise can hold forever. We are mortgaging our futures to satisfy our urges in the present. And the interest rate only increases with time.<br><br>With that in mind, I suggest we quit compromising and posturing and go after whatever it is we really want. DonÂ’t make excuses for others and donÂ’t sacrifice some of your own desires in exchange for temporary fulfillment of others. While you are busy compromising, you may just miss the opportunity to have it all.<br><br>Many people are going to read this and hate me for it. Understand that this is meant to be a satirical, cynicle look at compromise. But there is a hint of truth in it, and as we know by now, the truth is often annoying.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Compromise isn't exactly that bad a thing. Usually, pple have high expectations. Just like for anyone's requirement for future husband/wife, they will set a lot of conditions which not any normal person will be able to meet. So what happen when you meet this person whom you're so in love with, but maybe the person happen not to have, let say, a degree? Dump the fellow? well, if I'm the person, I would consider compromising and not outright reject the person. Noone is perfect... that's why compromise comes in.<br><br>As for short-term satisfaction vesus long term disappointment, it really depends on how important is this compromise... if it's just a minor compromise such as overlooking someone's disgusting laugh, i'm sure there's no long term disappointment...</div>
