Around 7 people went. Armed with a camera and videocam, we went there..However, due to the lobby being EXTREMELY cold at that point of time, and most of the people unwilling to enter, we left.

Here's how it went<br><br>*Actual scene*<br>Videoman: "Ok ah..here is the hospital"<br>Friend: "Eh, on night vision, cannot see"<br>Videoman: "Night vision..on"<br><br>Then we could see the hospital building clearly. My friend proceeded to use our flashlight to shine at each window, asking every time,"Anything?"<br><br>The flashlight, as you all may know, will appear bigger and dim on the building wall.
