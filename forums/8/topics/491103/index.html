              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">Hi guys, I'm a student doing a presentation on Lookism. The reason why I have chosen this topic instead of other discrimination such as racial or gender discrimination, is because I strongly feel that this is a problem that many of us have faced or will be facing regardless of your skin colour or gender. This is also a problem that many don't take notice of, or don't take very much to heart. So I would like to use this opportunity to share about this type of discrimination, in hopes of getting people to recognise that lookism is a serious problem. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">Generally, any discrimination based on appearance such as the clothes you wear, skin conditions, beauty, weight, masculinity/feminity. In this forum, I'm hoping that you guys can give me a description, whether brief or elaborate, of your experiences of lookism. It may be at work, at school, between strangers/acquintances/friends, or even at home. Even if you may be pretty or fit, you can still be discriminated and please feel free to speak up about it in this forum. What are dicriminated for? By who? How did it affect you? And most importantly, I really would love to know how <strong>YOU</strong> stood up or are planning to stand up for yourselves.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">In any case that you wish to share with me privately, you can pm me. Thank you :D</span></p>
              <p>To all who were discriminated,</p>
              <p>~<em>Beauty is in the eye of the beholder~</em></p>
              <p>You are all beautiful :)</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I'm Chloe. Want to start building a mobile app. Trying to find a good app designer that doesn't costs me a bomb, and now learning how to code just to cut down the costs. Last time was able to find some Indians to do build the app, but result is shit, and it feels like they didn't put in much effort, and blindly follows orders. Looking for partners, but hard to find, and afraid of conflicts in the future. Sigh.</p>

              <p>Today something happened at a carpark.</p>
              <p>In short:-</p>
              <p>A man - Indian, does not speak in Singapore Acent - honking in his BMW 7 series - which then we should relate to him as being rich, bullying a Singaporean Chinese lady in a car with comments and bad remarks.</p>
              <p>Story:</p>
              <p>I was looking for a space to park my car whilst waiting to pick up my daughter from her mandarin classes.  There were plenty of cars parked randomly.  I moved my car so that i will not be blocking any cars as it was a small carpark.  
              There was continuous honking which I looked around to see if I was blocking anyone of which i did not see any problem.</p>
              <p>Finally, I saw a car maneuvering out of which I thought he needed more space, so i moved forward to enable his big car to get out of the parking lot successfully.
              He lowered his windscreen and was talking about something which i lowered mine to see if there was an issue.  
              He commented that when i was parking my car, i almost hit his car and was reckless.</p>
              <p>I replied - Uncle, No.  I was never reckless.  I saw your car easily via the rear camera installed in my car.  Why would i hit your car?  
              Rudely, he commented other stuff which i was not interested as I did not want to be affected by such an incident whilst seeing my daughter.</p>
              <p>Point 1:-
              How I park my car or anyone parking their car - was never for him to comment on our skills.  He did it because i was the only lady in the carpark.  There were other bad mannered vehicles parked in a more haphazard way - why was it not confronted but only me?  Commenting on my driving skills coz he is of a better skill set?  Based on what?</p>
              <p>Point 2:-
              When i said no, i can see the all the cars via the rear camera installed in my car - he refuses to acknowledge.  Is it because my car is of an inferior brand to his?  It is common to have cameras installed in cars - is it not?  Why refuse to acknowledge?  Just want to lash out because i am of a different gender? Or am i of a different race whom does not deserve equal respect?  
              Men drives better and can lash out at female drivers?  Or is it because i am just an auntie who is not sexy and does not drive an expensive car so i cannot be a good driver? Or I deserved to be lash at by him?  Why would i hit into his car?  If this happens, not only will his car be damaged, so will my car.  What kind of logic is that?  I am a stupid lady who will do that so that both our cars will be damaged? </p>
              <p>Conclusion:</p>
              <p>He only bully ladies whom are of a fairer gender?</p>
              <p>Action:</p>
              <p>His rude and disturbing behavior deeply affected me that i have decided to post in on the web about such bullying.
              I regretted not taking a photo of him and his vehicle and post it online via social media to prevent such sick behavior.</p>
              <p>We Singaporeans have always embraced people from all nations as we were taught to be understanding to all circumstances and live in harmony.
              If foreigners who are MEN(in this case) find it difficult to embrace this culture, they should not stay in Singapore at all.</p>
              <p>Do not come to Singapore thinking because you are wealthy and can rule Singaporeans with whatever methodology which had been used or practiced in your country.  Show some respect to yourself if not to others and do not disgrace Singapore with that type of attitude and actions.</p>
