            <div class='col-md body'>Jesus Christ's Witnesses Claim that Jesus is God<br>John 1:1 - John writes, "the Word was God." This is clear evidence of Jesus Christ's divinity. (Note: in the Jehovah's bible, the passage was changed to "Word was a god." This is not only an embarassing attempt to deny the obvious divinity of Christ, but it also violates the first commandment and Isaiah 43:10 because it acknowledges that there is more than one God).<br><br>John 1:2-3 - He (the Word) was in the beginning with God and all things were made through Him (the Word who was God).<br><br>John 1:14 - the Word (who is God) became flesh (Jesus) and dwelled among us, full of grace and truth.<br><br>John 1:18 - the Greek word for "only-begotten" is "monogenes" which means unique, only member of a kind. It does not mean created.<br><br>John 1:51 - the angels of God - Matt. 13:41 - Son of Man's angels; 2 Thess. 1:7 - Jesus will be revealed from heaven with His angels.<br><br>John 3:5 - Jesus says without baptism one cannot enter into the Kingdom of God - Col. 1:13 - Paul says this is Jesus' Kingdom.<br><br>John 6:68-69 - Peter confesses that Jesus is the Son of God who has the words of eternal life.<br><br>Acts 2:36 - God has made Jesus both Lord and Christ - Acts 4:24 - Sovereign Lord who made heaven and earth. This means Jesus is God.<br><br>Acts 3:15 - Peter said the men of Israel "killed the Author of Life." This can only be God - Acts 14:15 - who made all things.<br><br>Acts 20:28 - to care for the Church of God which He obtained with His own blood. This means God shed His blood. When? When He died on the cross. This means Jesus is God.<br><br>Rom. 1:1 - Paul is an apostle of the Gospel of God - Rom. 15:19 - Paul preached the Gospel of Christ.<br><br>Rom. 7:22 - Paul says he delights in the law of God - Gal. 6:2 - Paul says fulfill the law of Christ.<br><br>Rom. 8:9 - Paul refers to both the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ.<br><br>Rom. 9:5 - Jesus Christ is God over all, blessed forever.<br><br>Rom. 11:36 - God for from Him through Him and to Him are all things - Heb. 2:10 - Jesus for whom and by whom are all things.<br><br>1 Cor. 15:9 - Paul says he persecuted the Church of God - Matt. 16:18; Rom. 16:16 - it is the Church of Jesus Christ.<br><br>1 Cor. 15:28 - God may be all in all - Colossians 3:11 - Christ is all and in all.<br><br>Gal. 1:5 - God the Father to whom be the glory forever - 2 Peter 3:18 - to Jesus Christ be the glory both now and forever.<br><br>Phil. 2:6-7 - Jesus was in the form of God, but instead of asserting His equality with God, emptied Himself for us.<br><br>Col. 1:15 - Jesus is the image of the invisible God, the "firstborn" of all creation. The Greek word for "first-born" is "prototokos" which means eternal preexistence (it never means created).<br><br>Col. 1:26 - God's saints - 1 Thess. 3:13 - at the coming of Jesus Christ with all His saints.<br><br>Col. 2:9 - in Jesus Christ the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily. He is the whole and entire fullness of the indivisible God in the flesh.<br><br>Titus 1:1 - Paul says he is a servant of God - Rom. 1:1 - Paul says he is a servant of Jesus Christ.<br><br>Titus 1:3-4 - God our Savior = Christ our Savior = Jesus Christ is God.<br><br>Titus 2:11 - the grace of God that has appeared to save all men - Acts 15:11 - through the grace of Jesus we have salvation.<br><br>Titus 2:13 - we await our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ.<br><br>Titus 3:4 - 3:6 - great God and Savior Jesus Christ = God our Savior = Jesus Christ our Savior = Jesus is God.<br><br>Heb. 1:6 - when God brings His first-born into the world, let all the angels of God worship Him. Only God is worshiped.<br><br>Heb. 1:8 - God calls the Son "God." But of the Son He says, "Thy Throne Oh God is forever and ever."<br><br>Heb. 1:9 - God calls the Son "God." "Therefore, God, Thy God has anointed Thee."<br><br>Heb. 1:10 - God calls the Son "Lord." "And thou, Lord, didst found the earth in the beginning and the heavens are your work."<br><br>Heb. 13:12 - Paul says Jesus sanctifies the people with His blood - 1 Thess. 5:23 - the God of peace sanctifies the people.<br><br>2 Peter 1:1 - to those who have obtained a faith of equal standing in the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ.<br><br>1 John 5:20 - "that we may know Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life."<br><br>Jude 4 - Jude calls Jesus Christ our only Master and Lord. Our only Master and Lord is God Himself.<br><br>Rev. 2:8 - the angel of the church in Smyrna wrote, "The words of the First and the Last, who died and came to life." See Isa. 44:6.<br><br>Rev. 22:6 - the Lord God sends angels - Rev. 22:16 - Jesus sends angels.<br><br></div>
