If not, how can we explain after 1900, suddenly everything took up, tv, radio, computers, space ...how is it possilbe that for a few thousands years, human couldn't make that kind of improvement, but within this 100 years, mankind has take a great leap forward??? any views</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Now it is important that such stuff are backed by facts.er..sources leh?<br><br>I can't believe after yrs of evolution,yrs of science,yrs of experimentation there can be such ludicrous claims.<br>Science and education only got more recognition after 1900.Frankly i suppose it was the cold war the started the technological competition that forced the wheels of science to turn faster.All it takes is for an invention like the steam engine and the chip for ideas to build up on them quickly and snowball into improvements.<br>It's akin to having a basic foundation.<br><br>Fast developments after the 19th century are not credited to some alien mastermind.Maybe that person is reading too much sci-fiction eh?</div>
