            <div class='col-md body'>United at their brilliant best<br>By The Insider<br><br>Tottenham Hotspur 3 - 5 Manchester United<br>Not many games bring seasoned journalists to their feet, yet the buzz around the White Hart Lane press room after one of the Premiership's greatest ever displays suggested that this was something very special.<br><br>Debutant Dean Richards opens the scoring on an incredible afternoon<br>(BenRadford/Allsport)<br>And it was. Brilliance comes in several forms, yet none are more devastating than this Manchester United side at their magical best. Love them or hate them, there is no denying that they are the finest side in the land and if their rivals wanted proof that they are not likely to surrender their crown without a fight, they should acquire a copy of the video from this game.<br><br>When Tottenham stormed into a 3-0 half time lead, the talk of crisis was looming over Sir Alex Ferguson for the first time in over a decade. Having lost in Europe during the week and with a defence looking as if it were made of straw, this was not the side that have claimed five Premiership crowns in the last six years.<br><br>Yet real champions are not knocked from their perch easily. While the star studded commodities that are Manchester United's superstar players looked stunned as they left the field at half-time, their second half display showed why their are the central pieces of English football's greatest superpower.<br><br>It was a performance that will live long in the memory and in the catalogue of greatness that has been the Ferguson success story, this will be one of the most thrilling chapters. From Veron to Van Nistelrooy, Cole to Beckham, United had wounded lions intent on regaining their pride.<br><br>'It was a remarkable result and the sort of day I will look back on in years to come,' accepted Ferguson. 'To come back from three goals down away from home and play that sort of football was very special.<br><br>'What I said to the players at half time is not for anyone else to know. But I felt we played the first half feeling sorry for ourselves after getting beaten in Spain on Tuesday. They had taken some stick in the press and didn't look like they were responding to it.<br><br>'They are the best players in the Premiership and needed to go out there and prove it after the break. I expected that sort of response from my players because I know what they are capable of, but it was still a great display.<br><br>'Ole Solskjaer was the key to everything with his runs and pace up front, but some of our football was outstanding, it really was. And Van Nistelrooy and Cole were frightening today. Once we got the first goal back, everything flowed from that.'<br><br>All this after Tottenham turned in a first half display that was a blast from the past from the fallen North London giants. While Teddy Sheringham's name did not appear on the scoresheet, it was the former Old Trafford hero who was at the centre of everything.<br><br>New signing Dean Richards marked his debut with a goal after just 14 minutes as he latched on to Christian Ziege's corner to head past Fabien Barthez. And when Les Ferdinand strolled through United's poor excuse for an offside trap to add the second nine minutes later the party was underway at White Hart Lane.<br><br>As the gloomy storm clouds gathered over North London and the rain started to pound down, so it seemed United's problems were deepening as Ziege headed home seconds before the interval. The Tottenham bench could barely believe what they were witnessing.<br><br>Yet any thoughts that a 3-0 half time advantage is a guarantee of a victory against the champions were quickly dispelled when Andy Cole stooped to head home just 49 seconds after the re-start. It's safe to assume United's urgent start to the half may have had something to do with a little chat from Sir Alex at the break.<br><br>Indeed, the decorators may well be required in the White Hart Lane away team dressing room to replace the paint stripped off the wall by Ferguson's half-time assault on his players. But whatever the great man said, his players certainly got the message.<br><br>Van Nistelrooy celebrates the United equaliser<br>(ShaunBotterill/Allsport)<br><br>It took them just 12 more minutes to snatch the second as Laurent Blanc made up for some of his defensive frailties by taking advantage of some slack marking and heading home his first for the club.<br><br>Even at that point, with United still 3-2 behind, they looked the most likely victors and as they piled on the pressure, Tottenham were simply forced to open the door. When Mickael Silvestre delivered the perfect ball for Ruud van Nistelrooy, the Premiership's costliest striker dare not miss and he planted a fine header past Sullivan.<br><br>With that, even Tottenham must have started to accept the inevitable as the champions were proving their worth in no uncertain terms. It was left to the mercurial Juan Veron to fire the goal that sealed their fate.<br><br>As he burst into the box with Sullivan to beat, the Spurs fans drew a collective breath in the hope that the Argentinian master would somehow waste the chance, but that was never likely to happen. After another awesome all-round display, his cool finish sparked mass scenes of celebration from the United players and their jubilant bench.<br><br>The fact that Tottenham, a side that looked like European champions in that first half, had barely crossed the half way line in the second period ensure United's lead was never under threat and it was left to David Beckham to finish the job.<br><br>Handed the captain's armband in the absence of the suspended Roy Keane, Beckham had time to line up his prey and fire home the fifth four minutes from time. It was cruel on Tottenham, but the reality was that United had been just too good for them.<br><br>Â¡Â° We just sat back and let them come on to us. Â¡Â±<br>Â¡Âª Glenn Hoddle<br>'We just didn't put them under enough pressure in the second half,' accepted shell-shocked Spurs boss Glenn Hoddle. 'They have so much talent in that side and are always going to create chances, but we just sat back and let them come on to us.<br><br>'There are some positives we can take from the game as we scored three excellent goals and passed the ball superbly in the first half. I know the fans will have enjoyed that, but we are in the business of winning football matches and we didn't do that today.'<br><br>United's woeful first half defensive display should not be ignored and will remain a concern for Ferguson, but when he has this much attacking talent at your disposal, there should be no need for him to worry.<br><br>Breathtaking, brilliant and clinical, Soccernet's Insider has rarely seen a display with this much authority. The Premiership trophy has never before been handed out in September, but in just 45 second half minutes, champions Manchester United have made their statement of intent.<br><br>------------------<br>I have found you<br>be honoured!</div>
