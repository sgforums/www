              of life itself is a tough, vague. It would be further branched into the start,
              the process, the purpose and the after-end. Societies are created overtime and
              believes start to ignite, spread and finally took over. Fear of the unknown and
              incomprehensible can be manipulated and channeled to the creation of faith.
              Religions are seen to make the pieces all fall into place, answering the
              unanswerable with ‘the power of an almighty’.</span></p>

              always described as short. Having only less than a hundred years to live, are
              we doing what we really want to do in life? Are we spending too much time on
              things people want us to do? </span></p>

              afterlife. What really awaits us after we die? Do we stay and stray around as
              spirits and ghosts with or without a purpose? Or do we have to go through a
              judging process to determine how well behaved and faithful were are when we
              were alive, and then sent to heaven or hell accordingly? Do we get a change to
              meet the gods or God? Or do we start anew in a new body? Or is there
              nothingness after life? Is it possible that after we die, we would be
              purposeless and just exist as a non-existent matter experiencing the feeling of
              nothingness? </span></p>

              prepared to die? A few months a go I thought I was. For now I’m still unsure.
              There are many aspects of lives that we as individuals want to achieve. Some
              are noble, and some aren’t. Some are personal, and some are global. Is life be
              a platform for us beings to have fun, progress and celebrate or are we here for
              a greater purpose? It’s like being a video game. Do the characters know of the
              outside world that is actually controlling them? Do they know that they don’t
              have the power to control their actions? This is where the theories of
              dimension apply, where simply only larger dimensions can exist in smaller
              dimensions and its vice versa does not exist.</span></p>

              before self. Really? Why make others’ lives better when we have our own lives
              to lead, enjoy and cherish. Should we live and base our conduct on others’
              expectations? Should we care what others think? If yes, why do so? Why please
              others when we have our own lives to live and enjoy. Should we change the way
              we behave, the way we look the way we talk just to satisfy others? Who are they
              for us to please? What gain do we get that is superior to enjoying our only one
              and only life? By helping them does it make their life more important than
              yours?</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">They say
              responsibilities change a man. This is as responsibilities come with
              expectations. Expectations change men. Can one resist or minimize the change so
              small so to meet the expectation but at the same time preserve his or her true
              colors and conduct? Or should one compensate or tarnish his or her image to
              have fun being his or herself? Is this the price for recognition and authority?
              Sacrificing one’s ‘self’, time, friends for a position/rank. It is worth it?</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It’s so
              easy to give advice to others. Everyone has problems. Why is it that we can
              give the best advices to others yet unable to act on it when we face it
              ourselves? Were we made to help one another? Are encouraging and giving moral
              support a necessity for a society’s progress? One can only know the depth and
              psychological impacts of a problem by only truly bring in the person’s shoe.
              It’s easier said than done. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You are
              what your friends are. From observation and experience, I believe that the
              statement ‘you are what your friends are’ is valid. There will always be
              someone in a clique of friends who unconsciously act as the leader. It is he
              who make the decisions despite the putting up of a ‘show’ of democracy for his
              votes would determine more votes from his peers. Soon, there will be an
              exchange of traits, characteristics and habits. This will be followed by common
              thinking structures, similar thoughts and frequent ‘cutting’ of words, where
              ‘cutting’ refers to at least 2 speakers saying the same word/phrase/sentence.
              The final stage would be knowing what the other is thinking just by gestures or
              eye contact. All this would not have been developed if the first stage was not
              established properly. The first stage consists of a small talk that then
              evolved into a friendly level discussion and finally an establishment of common
              interests. This is where the foundation of the friendship begins.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As for the
              phenomenon of exchange of traits and behaviour, I have put myself in an
              experiment to see how much my friends and I would ‘trade’. It was more than
              experiment as I believed that is was for the greater good. I believe that I was
              a good influence to them and thus by carrying this out, the good that will come
              out of it will most likely outweigh the ‘bad’ that I receive. I am not labeling
              them as bad, I am just referring to certain bad traits that they have, as
              exchange of good traits are harder to identify and that the good that I receive
              is a bonus (I don have an idea of how to phrase this). As time passes by, it
              has been more than a year now, I find myself being more like them as I can be.
              I most definitely have changed in terms of how behave and how I respond to
              situations. It has come to a point whereby the persona that I have built
              with/for them has become so strong that it is having a ‘spillover’ effect, affecting
              my other personas in both good and bad ways. Yes, it is that strong. The good
              thing is that I see my friends carrying out the behaviour that I have. They
              too, have certainly change especially in they way they think. It has become
              more alike to that of mine.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I am the
              type of person who would observe, analyze and make predictions to what I see of
              other’s behaviour. It has become second nature for me to judge and predict
              their lifestyle, common behaviour, background and so on. The same goes when
              people look at me. I would guess how they think of me, and then change
              appropriately. Sometimes I purposely choose my words so wisely so that I could
              totally change their perspective on some things. I’ve experimented it once,
              which includes some conscious acting of ‘unconscious’ actions and expressions
              that usually only shows in a jiffy. It added to the authenticity of the act. At
              the moment where he’s reaction changed, I knew my attempt was successful. I was
              lucky he was a naïve guy. I knew him for quite a long time and already knew way
              of thinking. However, I did indeed feel rather bad sometime after the incident.
              I don’t know if I should feel lucky, unfortunate or guilty to been doing the
              things I do. Manipulating others to think the way I want them to as they are
              too easily ‘cheated’ in a way. I plead guilty. Sorry.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><span> </span>Some of these changed when I met someone who
              thinks the way I do. He was able to know what I was thinking and was always a
              step ahead of me. Even my mum is thinks at least a step ahead of me. I was
              rather impressed when she made logic of a subconscious decision I made. Her
              explanation made perfect sense and was probably what my subconscious mind was
              thinking. I knew I was no match for her for she did raise me.</span></p>

              don’t even think of my own self-interest. Living my life for others. Doing what
              I’m told to do so I don’t disappoint. I just learnt to say no, and the journey
              has been tough. The feeling of guilt is like a knife driving down my abdomen.
              I’m definitely not used to this and at the same time not wanting to change back

              son. A brother. I don’t think I’ve been playing my role well. I’ve been
              neglecting family time. Its not totally my fault. At least I think so. I never
              really share my experience and stuff I encounter at school with my parents,
              despite me being in school most of the time. At home I’m much more reserved as
              I’m always tired, stressed or angry. When I’m feeling any either of these, I’d
              usually ignore to my family members who talk to me. Not that I don’t respect
              them. Its just that I fear my response. When I respond, I am afraid that I’ll
              shout or answer back really rudely. Its something about me that I learn and I
              have to control ever since I disrespected one of my old one rudely.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Everyone
              has parents. Be it biological or not. We were parented to what we are to be
              today. I believe there are two types of wiring that determine what we are
              today, tomorrow and the rest of our lives. Hard wiring is something that has
              already been in a way ‘implanted’ into us. Like the instinct to eat, to
              survive, to copulate. For different individuals I believe we are hard wired to
              do develop an interest in a certain field and then doing it well. This is
              regardless of what happens between the times you we were born and what we end
              up to be when we have grown up. Soft wiring on the other hand is what I believe
              is what affects the distortion or the guidance of one’s capabilities, traits
              and behaviour. It is actually what happens around child starting from the
              moment the child is born. Soft wiring is a passive phenomenon that continuously
              affects the child. For every small action, every little sound, every little
              feeling… It will affect the child. An abused child would likely to turn out to
              be an abusive father, unless the hard wiring is strong enough to off set it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span>For me, I’m not a strong follower of my
              religion. I wondered why as I know that my dad has done almost everything
              possible to get me into learning, appreciating and understanding the religion.
              I’ve been to religious classes ever since I was 4. I’ve learnt the basic of the
              language, I followed my dad to religious related events every week, and I
              followed him when praying. Everything was going well. At least it was what my
              dad thought so. I don’t know how he feels now. It’s most probably
              disappointment. I have no clue why the interest or practice of the religion
              faded as I got older. Could it be that my mind have started to mature and able
              run things independently of what I was taught? Judgement plays an important
              part in whether I should or should not practice it. I believe this process of
              judgement is not done consciously. I never had got myself to sit down and think
              of whether I should or should not believe in a religion. It’s like my mind my
              up its own mind. It controls my action without me knowing. And only until now,
              around 5 years later that I realize what my mind has done. Maybe it’s not the
              mind. Cognitive and volitional processes took place without me acknowledging
              it.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I think it
              is interesting how we remember things. Some people remember an event, and then
              the minor details, while others, they remember the details, and eventually link
              them up to the event. It is as if these memories have their own primary keys.
              The primary keys are then are linked to other memories through relationship. It
              could be a one to one or a one to many. When a burst of ‘one to many’
              relationship events are continuously linked, the bigger picture is painted. On
              the other hand when we remember the event, and then the details it is similar
              to finding a missing piece of an almost finished puzzle. There are times when
              we just squeeze every little ounce of brain juice to remember something. It
              could be a word, an event or a name. Most of the time when we attempt this, it
              is usually failure. Only after participating in another activity will we
              suddenly have this spike of intelligence or enough memory to remember back the
              ‘missing puzzle’. Our mind/brain works passively in the background when we are
              consciously engaging in an activity.</span></p>

              I believe there is much more to life then just living in a routine for own

              be an actor. It was where I believe the series of taking in multiple
              perspectives simultaneously occurred. At that time, it was hard to control feelings.
              It was as if I didn’t had any. My feelings would be based on my previous or
              current characters I have played. Yes, I did behave awkwardly. There would be
              times I could scold and swear and the next second laugh. Even my tone, speech,
              gestures were affected. I knew it wasn’t me. But it was hard to get out of the
              character I played. I didn’t know of anyone who faced the same problem until
              this year(2010) when I viewed a certain actor’s interview. It was quite a
              disturbing experience for me as it lasted for a round a year. It was hard both
              for my friends and I to understand myself. Every time an event occurs around
              me, it was as if I had a shelf of emotions or speech to choose from. I didn’t
              have any real reaction. It was superficial. It was an act. Some times I wake up
              in the morning asking myself, “What role shall I play? If this was a game which
              traits/characteristics will suite me best for me to win this game of life?” </span></p>

              acting this is why I always put myself in others shoes. I see things in many perspectives.
              Even when I am typing this now, I am already putting myself in the shoes of the
              readers. In a room when talking, walking or whatever, I would have already
              subconsciously put myself in their perspective. I guess it’s being
              self-conscious unconsciously without me wanting it. When I get myself to fit
              into their shoes, I would make sure I am a step ahead of them. Always wanted to
              outsmart, outplay and determine their moves. Sometimes I amuse myself by doing
              this. I am guilty for manipulating others at times. Putting myself in others’
              shoes gives me an edge. I plan my approach to adjust their response. I am sure
              there are many others who do this. The key is making the victim unaware of this

              agree with. This is cause it may be a blind spot that I refuse to accept.
              People say I am confident. They have make myself believe that I am confident. However
              it is only to my disappointment that I realized myself being so low
              self-esteemed and lacking of confidence. I was in a sports tournament a while

              However I kept tell both them, and myself that I wouldn’t be able to make it. I
              simply gave up. It is most definitely easy to say “Don’t give up! There is
              still chance!”. But to actually act on it, given the pressure and
              circumstances, it is definitely most difficult. I dislike the fact that I am
              not confident. I realize how much a burden my lack of confidence can be. I
              truly was a disappointment although my team mates didn’t show it – not because

              things. What we think we believe in which is made up by our mind, and what we
              really believe in which is made up by our hearts. The way our minds think is
              like that of the evolutionists/atheists where evidence come first followed by
              smart interpretations of it -the scientific method. The thing about out hearts

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I guess
              believing in something is not a conscious decision to be made. It’s one that is
              made unconsciously by the mind and heart through the accumulation of
              information by experience or imparted knowledge. It’s not something that can be
              forced. It’s beyond my control to make myself believe what I want to believe

              differentiate black from white, noise from silence and medicine from poison.
              With this, we’ll lose our voice that we once had, all because we wanted to
              blend in with the norm.</span></p>

              <p>@Kosen<br>Thanks man. I think ill maybe work on categorizing my thoughts, that way people can choose what topics they want to read on. The reason i didnt want to do this as it would affect the flow of thinking that I had.. Like from my post u see that initially my mind was a mess, I didnt have any flow of thoughts.. they were just everywhere... As time passes by my thoughts became more structured and 'slowed' down as seen from how I actually typed my thoughts..</p>
              <p>Not sure if it makes sense but.. yeh.</p>
