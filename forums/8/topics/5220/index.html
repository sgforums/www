            <div class='col-md body'>All comments are welcome to this topic.<br>Singapore has a world class Turf Club at Kranji. We have also saw (it was telecast LIVE to the living room) the running of the 6th richest race in the world...The SIA International Cup..with a hefty S$3 millions prize money. The Cup was won by our local thoroughbred "Ouzo"..ridden by J.Saimee and trains by Malcolm Thwaites. The event was also attended  by our present President S.R. Nathan and the First Lady. A comment was made by a Minister saying that the Turf Club was build with "globalisation" in mind..to take on the best in the world.<br>Now for the questions of the topic. How do you buddies in here..see those racegoers (myself included) every racedays streamlining to the Club as? Gamblers?<br>If we are classified as gamblers..and the authorities are supportive of the Club..why can't we have a Casino here too? It really doesn't matters isn't it? We are there to make or lose money. The prize giving ceremony is just the "smokescreen" of the actual reasons we are there.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes Tommy, I sense your deep 'sarcasm'.  If we can strive to have (and the govt obviously supports) a world-class race course (to compete with others like Dubai), what not have a world-class Casino? (after all competition for that even nearer, in Genting)<br><br>Honestly I have no idea why.  Let us assume that gambling of any form is bad. To argue and be consistent with first principles, one should ban all forms of gambling in their various guises, including ToTo, 4D etc.  But as you know now we even have legal football betting.  To argue that gambling is bad, why we should even ban the stockmarket.  Don't lots of people buy into the stock market hoping to make big bucks quickly?<br>[of course stock market can be classifed as buying financial assets rather than pure gambling, whereas when you buy 4D or bet on horses you aren't buying any assets whatsoever, but in the case of all these instruments punters are still betting on an uncertain outcome.]<br><br>Govt's answer is simple.  Since people like gambling so much, if govt bans all gambling, then gambling will just go underground.  So it's better to have legalized gambling and at least some of the money goes to charity (rather than some gambling syndicate) and you don't get that many loan-sharks running around chasing people's debts.<br><br>So let's have some gambling.  So we have 4D, Toto, and now a world class race course.  Why no casino?  Perhaps it's just the societal view that race courses and horse racing are somehow more dignified than casino.  As you said, it's quite proper to have dignitaries at race events.  Even the Queen of England attends some race events.  But you don't see Kings and Queens and Presidents attending some Casino event for example.  So maybe that's one perhaps superficial reason but still a reason.<br><br>Actually, with the Internet, i fear that more and more of our gambling revenue will go overseas.  For example, we know that Singaporeans like soccer, World Cup and the English Premier League. (Man U, Liverpool etc).  I'm pretty sure that there is a lot of betting going on in Singapore, perhaps not in gambling syndicates, but among supporters of different football clubs let's say.<br><br>Nowadays you just log-on, go to Yahoo, do a search on on-line betting and a whole new world will open up to you. Of course, you need a valid credit card lah!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lex..I take that as your comment...hahaha. I called you this afternoon..but the phone kept ringing.<br><br>Yubbadoobs..hey.. thanks for that comments. My rebuttal can be quite "straight-forward". Please do  bear with me..it is just an exchanges of views and nothing personal in anyway..okie?<br><br>Societal views of betting on horse-racing more dignified than Casino? Really? A bet is still a bet. Whether you are betting on a horse to pass the post first or to catch the rolls of the dices..it make no difference here in Singapore. The view of those typical non-gambling Singaporeans still term us as "Gambling Ghosts". "Dignified" is as and when the authorities wanted it to be. The S-League was "born".. with the attendance of our Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong amid the fireworks, cheerleaders and marching band. So can a Casino.. if they wanted it.<br><br>The legalisation of betting on horse-racing, toto, 4-D and footballs is to prevent underground syndicates from operating, so that we don't have so many loansharks hounding the debtors? If it holds true, then I really think that the authorities should consider a Casino...in view of those raids on the underground mini casinoes sprouting all over the Island as reported by our local Papers.<br><br>So..should or should not the authorities considered building one?<br><br>If we were to take an apple and an orange as an example..what we see are two  different fruits in physical appearance...but they are edible! Isn't it ironic?<br><br>Good nite!</div>

There was a proposal put up..but was rejected by the Authorities. One of the reason was that Singapore has not come to that stage yet..to depends on the opening of casino or casinoes to generates revenues..like in Macau. So in the meantimes..we just have to Dreams On.<br><br>I agreed with your view that gambling should be tolerated and not encouraged. But reality bites. Look at those long long queues when the authorities top-up the Toto prize money to S$10 millions. Now you tell me..is that tolerating or encouraging?
