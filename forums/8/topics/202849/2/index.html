            <div class='col-md body'>To me I started watching Euro 88 and then 90 WC and then Euro 92, 96 as my growing up years. In 1988 the Dutch team of Marco van Basten, Ruud Gulit, Ronald Koeman blew me away... their orange color reminds me of old footage film of the 1974 Dutch team. There was sign of the rising German team with Karl Heinz Rummingge catching my eye.<br><br>In 1990 WC contrary to popular mania, I was mesmerized by the german team of Juergen Klinsmann, Rudi Voeller, Lothar Matteus, Pierre Littbarski  etc..... They were superb. In 1992 Euro the addition of more midfield generals like Thomas Hassler added the fun although the germans lose out in the Final against the Danes (Peter Schmicheal tat time). Such a pity the tradition of stocky short midfield players are now taken over by tall and mean players like Micheal Ballack. I like those short and stocky german midfielders back then cuz they remind me of Maradona   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Then came 1994 WC and then in 1996 Euro it happen again! The blonde guy Matthias Sammer and Oliver Bierhoff and Stefan Effenberg blew me away again. They may not be as good as Klinsmann team but still they lifted the Euro Cup. To me the late 80 to mid 90 are the best german team of the decade excluding the team of 54 and 74 of course.<br><br>Now after 2006 WC I see the german team to rise again in 2008 Euro with stars like Podolski, Schweinsteger and Lahm and many more young stars. Hope they are not wrecked by injuries during the time for 2008 or get caught taking bribes and sack from national team  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Yes I am a Germany fan hahahhaa....</div>

Unfortunately the hot favorites in the Final crash out the the less fancied Danes with Laudrup and Schmicheal as their more noticeable players?<br><br>But 1996 Euro will revive me back as Germany get back the Euro cup after the defeat at 1992.<br><br>Now England which have so many followers only have ONE 1966 WC triumph. Take a look at their Euro Cup venture, not a SINGLE cup. England can try to learn from the Germans in my point of view in terms of getting Cup glories. No offence to hardcore England fans  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
