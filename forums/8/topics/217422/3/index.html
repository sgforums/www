            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Jennifer Lopez:</div><div class="quote_body">Today, I went on 171 after school to go to Orchard Road with my bf. We sat down and as usual, my bf just put his arm around my waist, and was talking softly near my ear.<br>( No, we don't wear school uniforms, he was dressed decently in a polo shirt and pants, whilst I wore a highnecked white tee with jeans)<br>I noticed a woman in abt her mid twenties or so glaring at me, had no idea why, so peacably decided not to stare back and cause a confrontation.<br><br>Suddenly she got off her seat, walked over and started yelling at me ( I say me, cos she directed all her words at me, and not at my bf)<br><br>She said:'This is a public transport and there are children! If you want to do this, do it at home!', all the while glaring fiercely at me. In order to prevent himself from making a scene and scolding that woman all the unflattering things that he wanted to say, as not to ruin our day totally, he simply got up and dragged me towards the exit of the bus. I was in shock, and was quite reluctant to get off as I wanted to clarify what was so scandalous abt his putting his arm around me.<br><br>I'm still quite mad at her, cos I don't understand what caused her to fly off the handle like that. I wanted to give her a piece of my mind, but I guess its not worth my effort.<br><br>What do u guys think? Were we in the wrong? I just feel that she shouldn't have gotten away with this, since she threw a tantrum and we just let her get away with it. She was still yelling stuff at us after we left the bus... The rest of the passengers were giving her weird looks though...Don't know what to think now...</div></blockquote>Waitamin...was she a singaporean? You mean a singaporean actually spoke up for once?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>She most likely mistook your boi boi's actions for some lewd act, like foreplay...you know....ear licking.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Jennifer Lopez:</div><div class="quote_body">Today, I went on 171 after school to go to Orchard Road with my bf. We sat down and as usual, my bf just put his arm around my waist, and was talking softly near my ear.<br>( No, we don't wear school uniforms, he was dressed decently in a polo shirt and pants, whilst I wore a highnecked white tee with jeans)<br>I noticed a woman in abt her mid twenties or so glaring at me, had no idea why, so peacably decided not to stare back and cause a confrontation.<br><br>Suddenly she got off her seat, walked over and started yelling at me ( I say me, cos she directed all her words at me, and not at my bf)<br><br>She said:'This is a public transport and there are children! If you want to do this, do it at home!', all the while glaring fiercely at me. In order to prevent himself from making a scene and scolding that woman all the unflattering things that he wanted to say, as not to ruin our day totally, he simply got up and dragged me towards the exit of the bus. I was in shock, and was quite reluctant to get off as I wanted to clarify what was so scandalous abt his putting his arm around me.<br><br>I'm still quite mad at her, cos I don't understand what caused her to fly off the handle like that. I wanted to give her a piece of my mind, but I guess its not worth my effort.<br><br>What do u guys think? Were we in the wrong? I just feel that she shouldn't have gotten away with this, since she threw a tantrum and we just let her get away with it. She was still yelling stuff at us after we left the bus... The rest of the passengers were giving her weird looks though...Don't know what to think now...</div></blockquote>bus service 171? is it from yishun interchange to marine centre(i think) there? if that is, that service is always full of crazy kids and ppl taking that for 2 year already <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>arms around waist still ok for me, but i kinda find it irritating when young couples just kiss and kiss like nobodys business in public.  that gets a little tiring when its on public transport.</div>
