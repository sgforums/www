            <div class='col-md body'>The bottom line to learn from this is that you must stand up for yourself so you won't regret after the incident, do what you think is right so you don't feel after the whole thing wow, i was not wrong but still kenna scolding and then went off the bus or train for what, really should have......<br><br>That's why you have the feeling of 'letting her get away with it' because you are right, she got away with scolding u for no reason and shes a stranger who not even related to you. She should be minding her own business. Just talk back what you feel next time if you kenna this kind of psycho again. Even it create a commotion and other people stare but who cares? It's not their business because they are not involved in the situation. They are not going to help also.<br><br>I think another poster sums it up nicely when he or she mentoned that if people already come looking for trouble, no point caring about creating a commotion, just say what exactely u want, in my case, vuglar also nvm, cause strangers should not harass you in public for no reason. And it's not worth it to whack them, so just scold them back and let them know their thinking got problem.<br>At least next time they want try pull this kind of stupid stunt, they will remember last time they kenna scolding for opening their mouth to needlessly lecture people. That's the most important thing.</div>

I'm in the mid-twenties and I can stand a couple kissing (they must be members of the opposite sex lah. Same sex one, pls do that at home. Not because I discriminate them, but it's just that it differs from the my moral.) as long as they are not in their school uniform.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>when encountering such situation it's always best to keep your cool and try to avoid further conflict as it may worsen the situation. Sometimes it's best to take a step back and not go head to head on with the person as it will be embarassing. And anybody with the right mind will know that this woman is freaking wrong</div>
