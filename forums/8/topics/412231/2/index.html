              <p>I would agree that perhaps there are some genuine cases of people who SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD to stay in a flat anymore. People like the guy whose wife happen to fall sick and could not work thus losing that one income and affecting the servicing of the flat's monthly repayments. These are the kind of people who need help.</p>
              <p>HOWEVER, there was this guy who sold his flat and stayed in a beach simply because he lost money gambling (and no, dun blame it on the IR cos this happens 2 yrs ago) and wanted to get money from the sale of the flat. This kind of people, we should not help.</p>
              <p>So my question will always be, how many of these people who squats at beaches really deserved help? We do not really know. All I know is that the last thing Singapore will need is a crutch mentality. Help those who really need help and not those who expect help.</p>

              <p>You can complain directly to nParks, the people who are supposed to administer all camping locations.</p>
              <p>It is because of these people that camping permits were re-introduced. Its quite funny actually, because you are required to tick a box when apply for this permits which states that you have a permenant address.</p>
              <p>Any person is also restricted to camping 8 days in a month to prevent this problem.</p>
              <p>My personal take is that such people should try to engage the services of social service agencies. I think that as Singapore has no space, we can't support the equilivant of hippie colonies or people living off the land like bigger countries. If people do not intend to fit into the modern society Singapore has, they should consider migrating to our neighbours, where they could camp and do as they will.</p>

              <p>Society do not have mercy upon homeless, failures, poor, mental/physical handicap people.</p>
              <p>Charity or Religious organisations were established with only one main primary purpose, to make money and make more money under the false banner of justice, righteousness and compassion.</p>
              <p>Sure, you will definitely receive many things that money cannot buy but are still free in our society. Things such as Love, Care, Concern, Milo/Tea/Coffee, Biscuits/Bread/Rice/Curry, which utilise minimum cost to provide.</p>
              <p>Anything more than that, I regret to inform you that you will need to apply in writing even if you do not have arms, and I regret to inform you that you will need to apply for whatever assistance that requires some money because we are afraid that you might scam money from our organisation despite the fact that you are already sick, poor, or handicapped. And your application will be in the queue just like everyone else because we're trying to be fair to all applicants, not because we do not understand or incapable to measure the urgencies between different cases, but we hope you can understand and respect first-come first-serve fairness even though you might be about to die.</p>
              <p>Please ring 1900 numbers to donate, each calls is $5 each and we thank you very much for your generousity because this will also meant that our bonus package will be generous too.</p>
