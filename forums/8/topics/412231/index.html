              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Dont drag this into Speakers Corner forum, This post is created for Fellow Singaporeans to open up their eyes and discuss about the less fortunate here in our Island.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Go to Changi beach at 2am and see the amount of homeless people
                  there. I live 15mins drive from there, so changi village is my
                  everyday hang out place. One day if shit happens to your family,
                  let me tell you that, there is no welfare in place for you and your
                  family and i will see you at changi beach.</p>
              <p>Just last week, while walking there at 2 or 3 am, A group of
                  homeless people were sleeping at this huge shelter and one of them
                  shouted to me, That Singaporeans should help Singaporeans... I was
                  abit dumbstruck why he would say that to me... I think i know why
                  now... I think he means that we have forgotten them and have left
                  them behind and dont care about helping them.</p>
              <p>There are so many homeless people now in Singapore whom are
                  living in poverty. Open your eyes and take a look around. Look at
                  all the old people selling tissue paper and the people living under
                  void decks. Stop and think... Why this is so....</p>
              <p>Dont think that there is no such thing like this in Singapore.
                  If your eyes are blind or you have been told that there is no such
                  thing like this in Singapore, You are either ignorant or just dont
                  care enough or maybe you are just a young school going kid.</p>
              <p>There was also a video made recently by Al jazeera English about
                  the homeless in Singapore, Which didnt sit well with our PAP. (al
                  Jazeera Can be said to be one of the most famous News company in
                  the world. Cos they always challenge Goverments, corporations and
                  also Religious group(Even Islam)</p>
              <p>And Instead of spending $10million to integrate
                  Immigrants with us or spending our money Celebrating their festivals, We
                  ought to put all this money for the Homeless and those who are struggling to put food on their table.(Yes there are many who dont have enough to feed themself or their children and yes there are people here in Singapore who only eat Sardine and bread every single day)</p>
              <p>Your grandparents will tell you this.. Dont get sick in Singapore.
                  If you do, everyone around you will suffer, Not because of the
                  heartache that you are suffering but because of the amount of money
                  that is needed to treat you.</p>
              <p>Instead of saying a prayer, Pls do a good Deed and think about
                  the welfare of others, Maybe then Can you win 1st prize in 4D or
                  TOTO.</p>
              <p>We Singaporeans should start loving Each other and Unite with one another. Be proud that we were born and Raised here. And there is only a couple of million of us Left here in Singapore.</p>

              <p>No brother... This people are homeless people.. You can see it in their face, they are suffering alot.</p>
              <p>I usually drive to changi beach about 2 or 3 times a week to have supper and after that i will take a walk along changi beach to digest my food and i will always see people sleeping under the shelters and alot of times there will be small children there as well. I remember always seeing this cute little chinese girl running around the shelter and playing with other kids at around 2 or 3am for about 1 or 2months, Haven seen her recently but there are still other children there.</p>

              <p>you are concern on this because these homeless are blackies like you and you feel for them</p>
              <p>next time tell them to go and get a job instead of lying around relaxing on changi beach and expecting others to feed them</p>

              <p>I guess they are not as well informed as us in seeking help from the relevant authority or the authority have already a long queue of people to settle.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Tell me, is there ever a country with no homeless people? Do you want to pay more taxes to help these people? If the government increases the tax, you people complain. If the government don't spend enough to help the homeless, you also complain. Can't we all just be selfish people and mind our own business. Homeless people can go to welfare societies to help them get a job; They aren't hopeless. They have to help themselves. Society isn't going to give a shit about them unless they try to salvage their own situation. A welfare state won't help either. Look at how much Britain is in debt because of their welfare system. We work hard to earn money for our family and ourselves, not for homeless people!</p></div>

              <p>Investigate further on each person and find out the real facts of their circumstances. Most likely you will unfold a story that the person brought the sad circumstances upon himself, and then blame the government for not helping them.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I don't mind the government officials having high salaries as that will prevent corruption and come on, that's a justifiable sum for running a country, ain't it? It's not that we pay our ministers too high, other countries are paying their ministers too low. Don't get frustrated over the government's investments in the stock market. If the returns were high, will you be complaining? Investing is a good way of earning money if only the government makes an informed decision. A welfare system is a stupid idea because it has the ideology of a communist state. People should work hard and deserve what they get. So what if they are homeless, and so what if they seem pitiful? I might sound quite like a selfish arse here but the matter of fact is that we don't know why they are homeless or poor in the first place. We should only help those who are unable, although willing to help themselves. Like what mancha said, not every homeless person deserves helping, and furthermore, would you want to waste taxes to help these people to get back on their feet? Honestly, I do not. It's brutal, but it's true; I'll look at them, shrug at them and say to them "Poor thing, can't be helped".</p></div>

              <p>I usually drive to changi beach about 2 or 3 times a week to have supper and after that i will take a walk along changi beach to digest my food and i will always see people sleeping under the shelters and alot of times there will be small children there as well. I remember always seeing this cute little chinese girl running around the shelter and playing with other kids at around 2 or 3am for about 1 or 2months, Haven seen her recently but there are still other children there.</p>
