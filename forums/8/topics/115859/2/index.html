            <div class='col-md body'>Caramon, what is the point of spamming the forum again and again and again and again ad nausem on the same topic? The "problems" you keep bringing up are not unique to Singapore, there are many ang mohs that also resort to this thing called "mail order brides" because they cannot find a mate amongst their local women. At least be fair and say that Singaporean women are no different from those in other countries.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

But we keep seeing people like caramon who think they've made a nobel prize worthy discovery by posting the same B.S over and over again like the problem is unique, that sg women are unique in their "men are running out looking for foreign women". Frankly speaking, I think his argument is so thin I don't know why he even bothers at all. He'd definitely NEVER win the Nobel prize for a brain as light as his.</div>
