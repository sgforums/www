The basis of social segregation and marrying within status is actually not the women's fault. OPEN YOUR EYES.  <strong> Look at SDU - that is for graduates only </strong>. They got another matchmaking unit called SDS , for the non graduates ( polytechnic diploma / o levels/ ite holders). Whose fault to segregate the classes?<br><br>In the past , the rich will only marry the rich , the poor will marry the poor as well. The rich will buy the poor to marry into the family to carry on the family name and the rich girl will rule the poor guy - he is just a sperm bank for her progeny. This is also culture passed on.<br><br>http://fcd.ecitizen.gov.sg/cm_findyoursoulmate_fys_abtsdu.htm<br><br>There was a book written on the segregation of social classes and you can never find this book in Singapore.  The logic , as the book suggested , is genetic tailoring - smart and smart marry = smart children .<br><br></div>

Feels like to me you're like an old dog that just can't let it go. I don't like most local men, but I'm not a wimp like you. Since you dislike local women so much and yearning for so much submissiveness, get your butt into a matchmaking agency and stop boring us with the same thread over and over again. We do not have insomnia because we do not keep mulling over the same problems as you do.<br><br>By the way. may I remind you of the perils of plagiarism? Did you do the same thing for your term paper when you graduated from I don't know, am too bored to know, university?</div>
