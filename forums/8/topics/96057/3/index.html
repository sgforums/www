But in my opinion, there are some missing pieces.<br><br>We do know they are different level of understanding by different people about religion.  Just look at those learned (Priests, Pastors, Fathers, Brothers. Sisters and etc).  They spent years in Religious Schools to better understand the religion, to have a better understanding how the books come about, to have a better understanding of what's the meaning of life and eternal life, to have better understand what is our purpose in this world, etc.<br><br>Whereas, we just attend Sunday Schools, Bible Study Classes, and we now claim to have same understanding as those learned (who spent years in schools)?  And be able to "preach" to sinners?  And try to convert sinners by mear words?  Are we trying to do more harm than good to the sinners in the way we "preach" as some of us trying to do here?<br><br>I have to declare that I have no answers to my own questions.  I do agree that you may have all the answers, but do reflect on them first before you tell me the answers.<br><br>I really admire those Father and Brothers (Irish) who had really given up ALL EARTHLY POSSESSION, and devote themself to God (200%) and to mankind, by doing missionary works in backward countries (especially involved in the education field).<br><br>Yah, only yesterday, it was in the TV news that Singapore had acknowledge the contribution of one of the "Irish's Brother or Father" to Singapore.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I like chicken rice (CR), they like wanton mee (WTM). WTM begin to tell people WTM r tasty and tat people who do not like to eat WTM in the end to be close minded and stupid. Then come someone who like to eat CR and pursuade people about it. Finding their stand harder to take, they begin to talk about "sensitivity" between food, resort to attack the person pursuading people to eat CR and want to stop all form of such discusions, even though they never complain about tis when WTM r pursuading people to eat WTM</div>
