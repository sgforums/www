            <div class='col-md body'>Sama-sama. My mum forced me to go to jc as she thought I've wasted enough time having spend an extra year in secondary school. I knew I was in trouble from day one, got no A maths, no pure science, only option is to take a pure arts combi. So i choose Econs, lit, history and I tried maths which I subsequantly dropped (Because I knew I was goin to be made to drop it anyway). Last I did lit was in sec 2, so I was totally lost in yr 1, till today it's still a mystery how I passed yr 1 lit promos. History, my gosh, jc history is so different from O lvl history. O lvl hisotry just memorize everything, A lvls got to not only memorize, somemore got to write ur arguement and stuff. If i remember correctly, one is expected to write 4 essays in 3 hours, I hear it gets worst in uni.<br><br>I still question my decision or at least a decision my mother made me make at that time. But I can't gurantee I'd have done well if I had gone to poly or some other place. Maybe I should have just tried harder and not have resigned myself to the psychological barriers I put across for myself. I guess half the battle was lost from day one of yr 1.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I noticed many students are obsessed with studies and grades.  Most of our academic system have been geared towards narrowly judging and streaming students.  Very often, we forget that the most important purpose of education is to bring out the best in students by enabling them to discover whatever latent talent they have, be it academic or otherwise, and developing those talents to the fullest.<br><br>So for those of you who are stressed out in school, I hope you will go all out to try out new things, make friends and discover whatever talents you have.  Learn to like the subjects you're studying.  Forget the teacher if he sucks.  Forget your grades if they suck.  Find out the things you really like to do.  Find out the things you are really good at.  Put your hearts and mind into doing those things and may you find your bearings in life.  Life is not a sprint event, it's a fucking long marathon.  Just keep running in the right direction and you'll get to wherever you're headed.  Eventually.</div>
