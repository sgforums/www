            <div class='col-md body'>*sigh* I just want to share with everyone my experience...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>When I was in Primary 2, I was out on an excursion to the Science Centre. There I saw a girl from another class of my school. She looked really like my brother's friend's sister, hence I took notice of her, but didn't get to talk to her.<br><br>I wonder if it was fate or what, but in Primary 3 we ended up in the same class. I forgot when it started, but we grew very close to each other. I used to be a shy girl who didn't talk much, but now not anymore lah. But at that time I was very shy and my best friend was very popular among the classmates and was one of the top scorers in class. We were so different, but somehow we were just the best of friends. She had other best friends too, but she was all I had. I believe in one way or another I was special to her too.<br><br>Then one day, I can't really remember how everything started, but I think it was because I began to feel that she wasn't giving me enough attention. Then we had a massive argument. That was in Primary 5 or 6. I was terribly upset by the argument and she didn't feel good about it either, but somehow we just refused to clear whatever misunderstanding we had between us. The situation was made worse when she hated a boyband which happened to be my favorite. I shall not elaborate.<br><br>I cried many times in school because of the argument *weep* And it was only before the PSLE prelims that the argument was resolved. From that point onwards she made an effort to see why I liked the boyband and even bought their album and asked me for lyrics. She gave me every magazine cutting and posters she had of the boyband and tried her best to make me happy by saying things like "they're not so bad after all." I did my best in trying to appreciate what she liked too.<br><br>Unfortunately good things don't last. She had to leave Singapore to pursue her education in China. She left before the holidays even started, and I was devastated.<br><br>To many out there, this may not seem like anything big. But to a sentimental person like me, looking back now, I really really appreciate the efforts she made to make me happy, even though she didn't like the boyband at all (I think). We remained in contact for a few months after she left, but soon lost touch.<br><br>She's my true friend. I'm glad I've found at least one true friend in my life.<br><br>I think finding a true true friend really depends on fate. When you do find one, please treasure that friend because you'll never know when you're going to lose that friend like how I did.<br><br>------------------<br><span style="font-style: italic;">It is by tiny steps that we ascend the stars.</span><br><br>[This message has been edited by CheekyCow (edited 29 January 2002).]</div>
