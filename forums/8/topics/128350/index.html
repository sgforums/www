            <div class='col-md body'>Cherry has been called ugly all her life. For more then ten years, she couldn't snagged a date until something changed her life.<br><br>She was part of the growing number of people going for grooming classes to help them find love, encouraged by matchmakers who want them off their list of the top 20 percent "no-hopers" that was never being able to find a date, because of their looks or behaviour.<br><br>On Cherry's side, she recalls sadly of one incident that happened to her when she finally plucked up her courage to approach this guy for a date. Instead, the guy just laughed at her face and told her, "Fat hope, you're too ugly." On a brighter note, she decided to try online dating as the anonymity it provides may seem less painful for a way to nab a date. But it turned out to have the exact same painful results. Major Rejection, as some of them turned cold after she sends them a photo of herself.<br><br>Disappointment and despair overtook her as she decided to seek a matchmaking agency. She was tired of being labelled 'ugly' and only hopes to have a good, loving boyfriend. When she first stepped into the agency, a counsellor told her straight into the face that she needs a makeover. Cherry heed her advice and went for grooming courses. Those courses do indeed help Cherry change her whole outlook and confidence.<br><br>Unlike grooming classes of old, these don't just concentrate on etiquette such as how to eat dantily or carry yourself well but also includes hair and makeup tips, advice on what clothes, shoes and accessories to wear. For the really clueless, the image consultants might even go to her house and yank out combinations they can wear and bin those they can't.<br><br>And guess what? the effort seems well worth it. After Cherry's makeover, she finally snagged her first boyfriend at a party a month later. And he was the one who made the first move.<br><br>As she didn't want the guy liking her for only her looks, she decides to show him her old photos and the reaction was that he doesn't mind as he only likes her for who she is. Initialli, she thought it was the attention she paid to her looks that attracted him, but later she realises, was that her confidence she exuded (newfound) that made him fell head over toes with her.<br><br>Also, the guy that called her ugly tried chatting her up when they met by chance. Cherry, of course, gave him the cold treatment and walked away. Will she ever give him a chance even if he begged to be forgiven? No. She firmly quips.</div>
