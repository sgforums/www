            <div class='col-md body'>I used to have this friend who was a very good , sweet and innocent boy . He would eat his vegetables , do his home-work and go to bed by 8 pm (his bed-time) every night . To sum it all up he was a very 'quai ' boy .<br><br>But lately he got to know some so-called 'havoc ' friends who led him astray . They took him to all sorts of immoral places like dance-clubs where shameless people , clad in scantily atire , danced indecently . He was also dragged into pubs where intoxicating and addictive beverages were sold . Such drinks are bad as they cause people to lose inhibitions and act irresponsibly .<br><br>I'm really worried about my friend since he's being corrupted by such friends . I heard that his friends plan to drag him into a foam party next weekend to corrupt him even further .<br><br>Already I notice some Beng qualities in him starting to develop .<br><br>How do you think I should help such a poor guy before its too late ?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Its a hopeless situation.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>You can try to persuade/dissuade your friend, and try to convince him from the bengism mentality....<br><br>But sadly, most people just don't realise that what they are doing is erm.... kinda sad. In fact they'll probably tell you to mind your own business, since they probably feel that they're having the time of their lives.... (which in its own way, is quite true.... how many 'quai' people you know really have fun ?)<br><br>Of course, once things go realy bad.... they'll figure it out on their own. Of course, some never do figure it out....<br><br>Good luck.</div>
