            <div class='col-md body'>Facilities better than JC? Perhaps. Better than Poly? I beg to differ.<br><br>In any case, facilities doesn't decide the quality of education. At the end of three years your cert will not state what facilities there was in the school.<br><br>This brings us back to the inherent perspective issues about ITE. Regardless of how you see it, a cert is still a cert, compared to a diploma or degree, and facilities definitely will not serve to change that view. I have been to a few ITE campuses and are impressed with their current facilities.</div>

You generalize too much. Being from ITE myself. I can safely say that the folks here are no different from the poly folks in terms of character, attitude. We just lack behind academically. MUST is a strong word. You affirm the fact that we are only having a good surface value, below it, we aren't worth anything. Honestly, I don't give a flying fuck to people who don't like ITE or their students, I just don't like the way people love to generalize about us. Each school/insitution has their own problems, ITE isn't an exception. I do hope you'll take some time into thinking over your line of "must be outside look good, inside look bad..."<br><br>and facilities wise, having a campus that fantastic, but if no one uses the facilities or people choose to abuse it, what's the difference if we have it or we don't?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
