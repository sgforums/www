That wasn't a wild pig," Rhonda Blissitt said.<br><br>The Blissitts said they didn't know the huge hog drawing widespread media attention was Fred until they were contacted by Andy Howell, game warden for the Alabama Department of Wildlife and Freshwater Fisheries, whose agency found that no laws were violated in the hunt.<br><br>"Did you see that pig on TV?" Phil Blissitt recalled Howell asking. "I said, 'Yeah, I had one about that size.' He said, 'No, that one is yours.'<br><br>"That's when I knew."'<br><br>Phil Blissitt said he became irritated when he learned that some thought the photos of Fred were doctored.<br><br>"That was a big hog," he said.<br><br>Mike Stone, the father of Jamison Stone, the 11-year-old boy who shot the huge hog to death during what they described as a three-hour chase, has said the hog weighed more than 1,000 pounds and was more than 9 feet long. He told the Star he had been under the impression that the hog was wild, not farm-raised.<br><br>"We were told that it was a feral hog," Mike Stone told the Star, "and we hunted it on the pretense that it was a feral hog."<br><br>Telephone messages left Friday with Eddy Borden, the owner of Lost Creek Plantation, were not immediately returned.<br><br>Â© 2007 The Associated Press.
