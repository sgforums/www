            <div class='col-md body'>cardio sheds fats, weightlifting builds muscle and muscle increases metabolism which increases fat burning.<br><br>So i suggest a combination of BOTH, but dont just work on bicep curls, work on legs as well.<br><br>Because if you just have bicep muscles, its not a lot of muscle.Therefore you wouldnt be able to burn fat as fast as compared to one who has arms and legs muscle etc etc.<br><br>there are also much better ways to work your biceps using more compound movements rather than isolated movements.You can try curl grip lateral pulldown, curl grip barbell row, curl grip cable row, dumbbell rows.<br><br>and for god sake dont be like those idiots who deprive themselves of carbs, little carbs= less glycogen for muscles= lesser energy to workout.little carbs=less insulin release= not as good protein absorption= less protein absorbed to build muscle.<br><br>and please dont train the same muscle everything with weights.You will be overtraining.<br><br>visit my forum:<br><br>http://www.sgforums.com/?action=forum_display&amp;forum_id=2367</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>no i think the threadstarter wanted to lose weight purely by weightlifting alone. thats rather impossible to do. cardio exercises are much better to lose weight. eg. jogging. play some sports like soccer/basketball. a vigourous half hour of it can seriously tire u out. but its good. weight lifting only builds muscle. u will be fat and strong, but i doubt u will be able to have any muscle definitions as u'll not be losing weight.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>you want to lose weight? burn fats?<br>best is to do intensive cardio. like intensive sprinting. it keeps your metabolism high throughout the day. you want burn fats do that.<br>long distance jogging for an extended period will not help. you will only be losing water thats all.<br><br>weight lifting helps in building up your muscles and power. and muscle burns fats too.<br>for best results is to do both. only doing weight lifting wont help you to lose weight fast. really.<br>i had friends who went to gym regularly and got bigger in size nia. his fats isnt burning as fast as his muscle is gaining.</div>
