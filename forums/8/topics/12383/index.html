Spare tyres?? Reserves?? Bear in mind that the apparent "reserves" have feelings too. Put yourself in their shoes, how would you feel being someone else's reserve? No one in their sound mind likes being treated as reserves.<br><br>------------------<br>*** <span style="font-style: italic;">Nothing Lasts Forever</span> ***</div>
