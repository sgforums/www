            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Hi Im new here. Collecting info and flaming people if necessary. =)<br><br>Here's 1 story about a third party interfering on a 3 person friendship.<br>In this friendship, the 3rd person fell out with the other 2.<br>Here is what the ''kaypoh'' third party has to say.<br><br>Just in case you do not know who Patricia is, she is the ''replacement'' for the 3rd person. However in reality she is a more deserving friend towards the 2 friends.<br>The 3rd fell out with them because of a guy(a fucked up one) when the other 2 had adviced her not to continue hanging out with the loser. I can justified that.<br>This is because they have make up and break up a few times. Also, it is a well known fact that the guy is a playboy.<br><br>Patricia however, is girl that just got to know them and they got along very well as they had been classmates for at least a year. However this third party person shoot her mouth off randomly. Read the following :</strong><br><br>My computer crashed or something. Which explains why I'm updating my journal using the school comp. Blown fuse I think, according to my father. great, now I have no more distractions from my studies, because I have been spending too much time on the computer, searching for new and upcoming bands, downloading music, watching youtube, drooling after superlicious rock stars.....<br><br>Its time I paid more attention to my studies.<br><br>So anyway, one question that has been bugging me. Am I a good friend? Do I make use of others? Do I befriend people for my own selfish purposes? Those that I joked with, I laughed with. Am I leeching onto them just because I needed somebody to seen with so I won't seem like one big loser?<br><br>What exactly is a good friend? What constitutes a good friend? Somebody whom you can joke with? Or somebody who can help you with homework? Or lend you money? Or somebody who is always there, supporting you silently, letting you cry on their shoulder without a  single complaint, and you never ever seemed to realise their existence until they're gone?<br><br>When I burst out angrily yesterday, saying that friends don't quit on each other [I was referring to *Patricia forsaking *Zahreen to hang out with her superficial, backstabbing, shallow and childish new "friends"], Sarah and Cindy when like, ahems ahems, friends don't abandon each other hah?? Who's talking arh??<br><br>I lasped into stony silence after that. Even when sarah sat next to me in Physics class, I totally ignored her and never said a word to anybody for two periods. People mistook my silence for attitude and a huge overload on the "sensitive" part of my brain,. But let me tell you this: I was questioning myself. I was debating in my brain silently whether my current "friends" would be better off without me. Until now I still have not came to a satisfactory conclusion, but I feel that my friendship does not change lives, nor does it save anyone from the pits of Hell.<br><br>*Farhana, my only friend from primary school all the way till the present day told me a month ago that I had became more quiet, more reserved, more solemn and more sensitive. Which wasn't a problem, since she said that I had realised the universe does not revolves around me alone. She likes it that I listen to her troubles and problems now. But she said if it was at the expense of me being more sad and serious, she'd rather have the selfish but fun bitch she knew and loved back.<br><br>And I thought to myself, how can she still remember me when she has all her new friends in secondary school? Am I still her best friend? Or does she sees me as a burden now, and she only replied my messages out of politeness?<br><br>I had so wanted to ask this question to everybody I knew. I wanted to ask Fifi, *Jessica,*Patricia, and *Zahreen this. Had our four years of friendship meant anything at all? Would it have a permanent imprint on our lives? And I wanted to ask these questions to *Cindy and *Sarah, the two persons I trust the most in my class. Am I a burden to you guys whom you two are too polite to ignore? Do I really matter to both of you? Or would you rather I just drift away like a stray piece of wood floating on the endless ocean?<br><br>And a final note to *Patricia, I am not stopping you from making new friends, but it is important that you see how superficial they are. Don't you get it even up to this point? They're using you to replace a person who's love they have lost. They are only using you as a substitute. Dig your own grave if you want to, but I feel that as a friend, I cannot let a person as naive as you to stray across their path. Once you crossed them they will tear you apart like hungry wolves on a piece of rotting meat. Bear this in mind.<br><br>The bell just rang. Reccess time is here. ((:<br><br>* Names are subjected to change<br><br><strong>In my opinion, her words were totally unfair to the other 2 girls</strong></div>
