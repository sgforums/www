However, you cannot prove that time does NOT exist either..<br><br>Take for example length and height. length and height is merely a term to refer to the measurement of that LINE from one point to the other. The line exists for sure. "length" therefore exists - albeit only within languages - so that we can communicate how long the line is to other people.. or for ourselves as a reference..<br><br>Even without humans, "length" will STILL exist - animals will still build their homes, collect materials like wood etc (and yes they do know how to choose between different lengths of wood for example based on how big a nest etc) but obviously they don't call it "length" per se.. they call it wadeva it is they call it in their language..<br><br>this brings us back to time.. past present future - all words used the same way as length.. to describe events and let people know whether they already happened, is happening, or will happen..<br><br>as you can see.. it is nothing but language.. without humans, these "concepts" will still be around.. other living things also know the concept..<br><br>and so it all boils down to language.. any other questions..</div>

One view is that time is linear and part of the fundamental structure of the universe, a dimension in which events occur in sequence, and time itself is something that can be measured. This is the realist's view, to which Sir Isaac Newton subscribed.[1]<br><br>A contrasting view is that time is part of the fundamental intellectual structure (together with space and number) within which we sequence events, quantify the duration of events and the intervals between them, and compare the motions of objects. In this view, time does not refer to any kind of entity that "flows", that objects "move through", or that is a "container" for events. This view is in the tradition of Gottfried Leibniz[2] and Immanuel Kant,[3][4] in which time, rather than being an objective thing to be measured, is part of the mental measuring system. The question, perhaps overly simplified and allowing for no middle ground, is thus: is time a "real thing" that is "all around us", or is it nothing more than a way of speaking about and measuring events?</strong></span><br><br>So which distinct view on the meaning of Time are you referring to?</div>

One view is that time is linear and part of the fundamental structure of the universe, a dimension in which events occur in sequence, and time itself is something that can be measured. This is the realist's view, to which Sir Isaac Newton subscribed.[1]<br><br>A contrasting view is that time is part of the fundamental intellectual structure (together with space and number) within which we sequence events, quantify the duration of events and the intervals between them, and compare the motions of objects. In this view, time does not refer to any kind of entity that "flows", that objects "move through", or that is a "container" for events. This view is in the tradition of Gottfried Leibniz[2] and Immanuel Kant,[3][4] in which time, rather than being an objective thing to be measured, is part of the mental measuring system. The question, perhaps overly simplified and allowing for no middle ground, is thus: is time a "real thing" that is "all around us", or is it nothing more than a way of speaking about and measuring events?</span></strong><br><br>So which distinct view on the meaning of Time are you referring to?[/b]</blockquote>My understanding of time is not the Realist's understanding of time. Under the teachings of Emptiness, the understanding of the realist and the nihilist are both rejected.<br><br>Second definition of time seems better but I'm not sure if I understood what they meant. Time is indeed not a container for events or things happening, it is not a 'link' for someting that changes from this, to that. What arises, arises spontaneously, as Time, NOT in time. There is no coming and going, there is no movement in time and space.<br><br>Change occurs, but there is no changing 'thing'. There is NO duality of time and object. The trees and grasses is time. The keyboard I am typing now is time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It seems like the second explanation, though does not posit time as a container, is still dealing with comparisons. When there is comparison between two 'objects', which is a concept, is still movement in time. This is not being-time.<br><br>There is no movement in reality, only change. All there is is time and change, no changing 'things'. Everything is of this nature.</div>
