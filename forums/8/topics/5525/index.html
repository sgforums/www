            <div class='col-md body'>Another controversial topic suggested by me. heh heh.. seem to have this liking for highly debatable topics. : )<br><br>IMHO, there is no clear cut answer to this problem. Especially since both sexes would want to win this one. I would just like to point out some misconceptions people have:<br><br>1) just because guys tends to behave childishly/foolishly/act like a clown at times doesn't make them immature, (contrary to what most girls think)<br><br>2) maturity is a state of the mind, and should not be judged by actions alone<br><br>3) girls mature earlier than guys? In certain issues, girls do grasp the essence of it earlier than guys, and are more sensitive to certain things, and guys appear to only want to have fun (most obviously seen in JC)<br><br>Well, I have got lots to say about this actually, but I'd rather hear some feedback first. : )<br><br>Start penning!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For me, I have always had the thinking in my mind that no guy is considered to be matured as a MAN until he has entered the ARMY.<br><br>As long as a guy has not got enlisted, he is still considered childish and immature.<br><br>But then again, 2 and 1/2 years is a far too long time to mature a guy. CRAP<br><br>My colleague once told me this...<br><br>"You can talk a guy for 10-20 years..just to realise that all you've ever spoken to him was pure rubbish and just for laffs.<br><br>You can talk to a gal for 5 mins ...and you'll know alot more about her rather than just plain crap..."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the generalisation of girls being more matured than guys of their age is too far-fetched...<br><br>it all depends on individuals, i'd seen some women whose mindstates remained at their 20s even though they are already in their 40s and some old men who still think they are studs in their 40s...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maturity has got nothing to do with entering the army. *sigh*<br><br>Maturity is often just a term used by the 'more experienced' in life to put themselves on a higher pedestal. Oftentimes, 'mature' people call other people 'immature' because they simply disagree with their way of thinking and cannot argue out their thoughts logically. A truely 'mature' person will not have to call other people 'immature' just to prove it.<br><br>Maturity is a very undefinable quality, and it will stay that way. Guys and girls are different by nature, and I find the 'girls are more mature than guys' argument plain bullshit. Who is the judge of this? It is quite understood that girls do not understand the workings of a guy's mind and vice-versa...so whoever came to such a 'girls are more mature than guys' conclusion must either #1 be plain stupid or #2 be God.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I totally agree with Engima about maturity being a state of mind.<br><br>I have seen guys come out of Army more mature<br>whereas others remain as immature as ever.<br><br>Each person is unique and never will there be a twain.<br><br>I feel that girls/women rely too heavily on their emotions which are not very good for them generally.<br><br>Hope that u pple will not flame me, I am just giving my humble opinion.<br><br>------------------<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maturity doesn't come to everybody.  Maturity is the knowledge that u can have fun at the correct time and be serious and appropriate for situations that demand it.<br><br>It is the ability to understand situations, emotions, and mindsets....knowing and understanding are different things.<br><br>When u talk to that person, u will know if he/she is matured or not by the things she /he decides to say about things. It is also very much about an understanding and acceptance of urself and how ur emotions/mind works as well as how others tick.  It is the ability to understand the world and make calculated and informed judgements in accordance to whatever.<br><br>mauture people can be really silly, but they aren't idiotic and know when enough is enough.<br><br>Ultimately, u will know when u talk to them and look into their eyes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I totally agree with Firewire definitions.<br><br>Something to add on.<br><br>A person does not always have to show that he/she is mature by the way he/she talk, neither did it depends on the content of his/hers speech.<br><br>About talking,<br>Mature person knows when to talk, what to talk and most importantly, when to stop. It all depends on situation and a mature person knows how to handle that situation. Some people just put up two faces, during work and having fun. They can be a combination of both are either situation.<br><br>About thinking,<br>Mature person will not depends totally on his/her emotion to think and decide. He/She knows when to be rationale and when to be emotional.<br><br>About action,<br>Mature person know fully if not at least 75% of the consequences when doing something. He/She will go through a series of consideration and measurement of results before taking an action. The considerations and measurements depends on the way they think (refer to above point)<br><br>About all, it all depends on a person's experience in life, and his/her ability to learn those lessons after them. That is, the mindset.<br><br>No one could judge anyone to be immature or mature, that I agree.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Which sex is more mature?  Depends who and when ur talking about.<br><br>From observations:<br><br>men/boys-often seem to be more immature in that they like to be "childish" and acting idiotically in front of others.  A lot of guys don't consider emotions and feelings much when they do things when they're young.  They just like doing it or not.  Crude, rude, not sincere....etc<br><br>But, especially in Singapore, guys are burdened with more baggage than women/girls are.  They have expectations, one after another, being piled up on top of them from friends, teachers, parents, siblings fammily dog....u get my point.  Unfortunately or fortunately, the Singaporean male seems to become more in tune with his surroundings and starts to scrutinise  things around him after he reaches his late teens or early twenties.  Western males and females, by comparison, make that leap at about the age of 15-16.  Over here, children are insulated and spoiled very much by family and what have u.  More so than anywhere else in the world...(we beat Japan and Hong Kong on being the country that gives it's children the most spending money and we support those same children a lot longer than our conterparts in the west or regioanlly.  As a result, I think that the Singaporean male has a longer path to take before he realises that it's time to let go of childish ways of thought and start to take up responsibilities which will ultimately be the one thing that will define a person's maturity in future....REsponsibilities, and how he handles them...  I think that because of those expectations earlier mentioned, the sinagpore male becomes very responsible in living to those ideals.  At the very least, he trys to be, but it happens later in life than elswhere.<br><br>It's well known that people who are more independant and less sheltered mature faster and more completely than people who lived sheltered lives...That's why u see a lot of rich people being really childish in their thought processes and their reasoning skills.  They can't handle responsibilities well because they have never needed to...someone else was always handling it for them.  It doens't apply to all, but it is, by in large, true...and some indivduals who lived sheltered lives do mature faster than those who don't.  But in general, it's as I said..:-)<br><br>Singapore girls/females-Are very immature in my humble eyes.  Their expectations and fantasies of wanting certain things falling into their arms is evidence of this.  They suffer from the same sheltered syndrome that the guys face, but I think that because there is less expected of them(a lot less), they tend to not care or bother about changing/growing up.  I find that a lot of Singapiorean women make a lot of really lame demands of their husbands/boyfriends...verbal or otherwise...we know what I mean right guys?...:-)<br><br>A lot of Sing. women lack challenge and responsibility in their lives.  And usually that is perpetuated and sustained by the men who see that it is also theri role to make sure their women never have to dirty their nails...so to speak.  This in turn creates a mass psychosis that enevlopes the females here into thinking "...that's what men are for..."  By in large, the responsibilties that women do have are of their own doing, such as getting a job and what have u.  The cooking and cleaning, etc...is of a past generation already...it has stopped becoming so important...Especially since most people eat outside and spend more family time away from the physical confines of their homes anyway.<br><br>So there is a need on my part to pay respects and a kind word to those women who don't take everything for granted and go and take up the initiative to take up responsibilities for themsleves.  Sheers to u women. (not a typo):-)<br><br>It all works out to responsibilities.  Notice that it's the more mature people who can handle responsibilities better..or is it that responsibilities makes a person more mature.  It gives them, life knowledge...things u can try to teach at chool, but will always fail.<br><br>Responsibilties from relationships and other things will all work to make the person a more well rounded person in maturity.  Ever notice that people immature people who can't handle their emotions/problems always try and put blame on everything else but themselves?  They don't want to take responsibility for themselves/actions/ thoughts/words/deeds...etc...<br><br>Same goes for people who go through realtionships like changing clothes and can never seem to have any kind of stable or meaningful realtionship...they can't take up the responsibilty.<br><br>just the short version of it.  A lot of empty holes in my logic, but u guys get the point i guess.<br><br>:-)</div>
