            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Was wondering what are some of the interesting things that we can do on this boring island b4 getting to a smaller island this sep... suggestions?</blockquote>definetly must masturbate more and release your load first. best is the night just before you go in. KNN.......i not kidding loh.<br>u all think i'm joking then you all should wash your face.<br><br>BMT recruits cannot book out for the 1st two weeks. all stay-in(unless PES E).<br>2 weeks with no girls, no porn, everyday face guys, no TV.......i assure you : definetly will fantasize a lot about sex whenever you got time(like when you're not tired).<br>just be very wild on the last night before you go in. not kidding you.<br><br><blockquote>if u wanna be a commander or officer, always show urself that u can be a team player, in that way ur superior will take notice of u.</blockquote>that's the worst thing i ever heard. ok lah, being sergeant or officer in NS will be like almost god-mode lah, but also more work and more commitment.<br>like during holidays the men(CPLs and below) can go back have fun, while the commanders still must plan with the OCs on the training activities etc.<br>i assure you, commitment very heavy one and you even more sian.<br><br>worst thing is : even being officer during your NS life will not prepare you when you ORD loh. the whole world is like very different after you finish NS.<br>unless your rank is COL or BG when you get out of NS lah, then got difference(but impossible one).<br><br><blockquote>Last time, its more like sgt tikan recruits. But now, many of my army cronies complain that their role has shift from an instructor to a child care teacher. This is what i have gathered from my friends la.</blockquote>no lah, actually nowadays, SGTs still got tekkan recuits a lot. not much difference. the more the SGT don't like your face/attitude/character/personality, the more they target you all the time, even if you got no wrong. seen this countless times already loh.<br><br>the only difference between now and last time(30 - 40 years ago) is that the SGTs last time is really like god and behave like LTC like that : can ask you to get out of bed at 2 am and run in the rain loh. crazy ah, last time.<br><br>other than self-pleasuring, there's nothing else to do before going to tekong. look at my freedom now.......i feel like i'm god. looking back, although i PES E one, the one-week stay-in compared to freedom is also very KNN.<br><br>also, when you're in army, be good boy lah. be nice to everyone, from fellow recruits to SGTs to officers. like if you're nice to those outside cleaners in tekong, the sergeants/officers will also notice one.<br><br>also, if you're the shy/quiet-quiet type, those officers/SGTs also won't touch you so much, because they're more used to tekkaning tough guys.<br>if you're the shy-quiet type, you'll observe that their actions/speech towards you(one-to-one) also like they're very uncertain like that.<br>but if you wanna play this way, be sure to do it all the way until ORD lah.<br>last time my camp got one guy like that lah. SGTs and officers always shield him one, because he's shy/quiet and more like a girl lah(but he's not ah-kua at all).<br><br>SGTs/officers more like target those always want to slack that kind(which is majority of NSFs lah).<br><br>good luck hor.<br>when you come book-out, nikar will send porn DVDs to you. you got DVD player right? what titles you want? "monsters and blondes"? "30 on 15"? "japanese steama"<br>nikar.</div>
