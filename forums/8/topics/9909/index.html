            <div class='col-md body'>When exactly was Jesus born?<br>Was he truly born on Christmas Day?<br>If not, why do we celebrate his birth on December 25?<br>Most Christmas have wondered about these questions at some time in their lives.<br><br>In the Western world, everyone is familiar with the way of reckoning dates as A.D., for<br>"Anno Domini", which means "in the year of our lord", in Latin, and "B.C., which stands for<br>"Before Christ." At the first glance, this appears to mean that if the year is A.D. 2000, then<br>Jesus was born 2,000 years ago. Such a simple supposition hides a fascinating story. It turns out<br>that Jesus was not born in the year our calender would have us believe.<br><br>Our calendrical system, Gregorian calendar, that we use today, is based on the initial Roman calendar created during the days of the Roman Empire. This Roman calendar, with only ten months,gone through much amendments with the adding of two months by the decree of Julius Caesar. With the help from the Greek astronomer, Sosigenes, in reorganising this calender, Sosigenes also introduced the leap year in a stunningly accurate form, which worked successfully for more<br>than sixteen hundred years.<br><br>However, this more accurate Julian calendar, which is the basis for our modern calendar,had a<br>small cumulative error in the date adjusted by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582.<br>By having a leap year every four years, the Julian calendar had a slightly over-corrected the calendar, leaving too many extra days over time. Though the difference is tiny - only eight days per millennium - the small quantiy adds up to over the centuries and causes the calendar to lose<br>its correspondence with the seasons.....<br>........ (extracted from "The Star of Bethlehem: An Astronomer's View" By Mark Kidger)<br><br>Seems that our calendar system is really a revision and amendments of what we thought is a real accurate measurement of when Jesus was born.<br><br>Anyway, the fact is that even if we know that Dec 25th is not the birth of Jesus Christ, many people still don't care, especially Christians. For they just take things for granted already.<br><br>Well....it seems that the truth of what we think, is not always the truth. This perhaps includes religious belief.<br><br>Any comments and opinions?<br></div>
