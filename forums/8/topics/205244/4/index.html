I do believe there will be blacksheeps involve, they will be people who take advantage of people kindness to earn some hard-earned cash from them. Yes i do agree that by using preasure to force other to buy tissue from you is wrong.<br><br>But i still do not believe that eating a $3 buck meal is consider too much. Maybe eating macdonalds is a bit too extreme for the cases..<br><br>Why not put it this way, sometime after a hard day of work. Maybe it not wrong for them to treat themselve a considerable above average meal?(Somemore those meal u saw them eating are not consider exp in the first place) If u saw them the first time and than base your judgement just one time, guess it rather unfair to them. But if u happen to saw the same person always eating such good meal than it allright to base your judgement on them...</div>
