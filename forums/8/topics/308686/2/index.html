              <p>One scenario experienced by myself:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I went with my gf to sim lim square 2 years ago to purchase a digital camera. I visited every shop and finally I've found a shop that quoted me $450 for that. He explained every dumb function of it to me and my gf and lastly, during payment time. I asked if there was any warranty for the product. He replied no. I became inquisitive and asked if it was an export set and he said it was a local set but it doesn't come with warranty. LOL. I wanted to walk away, however, my gf admired that digicam for quite some time so I paid him the money with the additional amount of GST.</p>
              <p>Summary for the above paragraph:<strong> I've bought a local set digicam for $450 without warranty.</strong></p>
              <p>I went to a shop on the first level and inquired about the price of it again; the person-in-charge of quoting the price wasn't around during my previous request for quotations. He quoted me $350 with warranty of 1 year.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>Summary for the above paragraph:<strong>1 of the shops on the first level quoted me $350 with 1 year warranty  </strong><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Devilish Anger engulfed me, I rushed back to the shop that had sold me the digicam and told me about this. He said it's a different model and i insisted that it was the same exact model.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>
              <p>Such audacity, he sold me an export set at a price of $100 more than the local set and actually tried to claim GST for export sets. </p>
              <p>I tried to reason with him. He declined. Well, I told him I'll get write to the Strait times, chinese papers, inform reporters as well as have my problem settle by CASE. He budged out and refunded my money.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Last but not least, I pointed my middle finger at him after leaving the shop and he just stood there.</p>

              <p>No, I didnt buy from the first floor in the end. WHat Im saying is, you should ignore the first 2 floor of SLS, the shops at that level have a mentality of selling stuff to you at high prices or they wont sell to you at all.</p>
              <p>And if you are going to ignore the first 2 leves of SLS, you might as well shop at Funan where everybody there is more transparent in their pricing and gives good customer service.</p>

              <p><br>funan lulls you into a false sense of security then hammers you..</p>
              <p>do your market research first..</p>
              <p>anyone doing business is going to try to make the biggest profit possible..</p>
              <p>if you want a fixed price with discount, walk over to Mustafa..</p>
              <p>otherwise, caveat emptor..</p>
              <p>btw.. you do know that many people from other countries fly to Singapore to Sim Lim and Mustafa to buy electronics <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
