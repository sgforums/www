            <div class='col-md body'><p>^_^ I higly advise to make your own PC. Yeap the fully assembled ones are always readily servicable anytime it breaks down, but then having made your own PC actually gives you a more confident approach to troubleshoot it should it breaks down. I find it cheaper, lasts longer, upgradable anytime and obviously better. Just look at the hardware they're using, motherboards with built in sound cards, video cards and stuff. At those kinds of costs, you can get a better and faster customised PC that suits your needs. So you wont have to settle for something else. Dont like the video card? Upgrade, change, phase it out. But with the fully assembled ones, its always "once you touched this portion means its warranty is void..."</p></div>

              <p>I think your worries are unfounded. At the most, the good retailers would shift to other low cost areas and set up their bases there...maybe places like Queesway or little india or they can always go sim lim tower...better if they shift to Funan.</p>
              <p>What SLS needs is a total boycott and a cleansing of those foul retailers who charge more than what Best Denki or Courts does. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="icon_mad.gif"> </p>
              <p>You are right to mention that the days of getting good discount are long gone. If thats the case, I rather save my 3 hours of walking around SLS and just head to Funan to get my stuff knowing that retailers in Funan is unlikely to con me or charge ridculous insane high prices like those quoted at the shops located on the first 2 floors of SLS.</p>
              <p>And yes, I agree with you, we must support the honest retailers. Lets just all head down to funan and shop. SLS is fast gaining a reputation as a conman paradise along with most shops at Lucky Plaza.</p>

              <p>But Funan has a reputation to live up to. Like I said, the landlord do not tolerate all those conning nonsense. Have you seen a shop in Funan that offers to sell you handphones or laptops without batteries and warranty card and calls it a "special package" and charges you the retail price for it ?</p>
              <p>The situation in SLS is so ridiculous that PSP slims has 4 categories of prices. Those that are firmware mod that require boot disc. Firmware mod tt dont require boot disc, Hardware mod and unmodded export sets. Even handphones also has a few categories....e,g phones with batteries, no batteries, no warranty card, no keypad also have...(stupid but the person says it with a straight face) </p>
              <p>And if you want the full unabridged set, they just go " oh, we plus $300 for the battery, $100 for the warranty card and $10 admin fees to chop the warranty card. T0tal $800 for a N81 !!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Maybe its because of all these tourist who thinks every single thing here in SG is damn cheap that many retailers prefer a buisness modelled upon fleecing and stripping. After all, the tourist dont mind getting con...the stuff here in SG is cheap to them anyway.</p>

              <p>I think your worries are unfounded. At the most, the good
              retailers would shift to other low cost areas and set up their
              bases there...maybe places like Queesway or little
              india or they can always go sim lim tower...better if they
              shift to Funan.</p>
              <p>What SLS needs is a total boycott and a cleansing of those foul
              retailers who charge more than what Best Denki or Courts does.

              <p>You are right to mention that the days of getting good discount
              are long gone. If thats the case, I rather save my 3 hours of
              walking around SLS and just head to Funan to get my stuff knowing
              that retailers in Funan is unlikely to con me or charge ridculous
              insane high prices like those quoted at the shops located on the
              first 2 floors of SLS.</p>
              <p>And yes, I agree with you, we must support the honest retailers.
              Lets just all head down to funan and shop. SLS is fast gaining a
              reputation as a conman paradise along with most shops at Lucky
              Plaza.</p>

              <p>Sorry to correct you, my worries are true and real and unavoidable.</p>
              <p>Brand name suppliers prefer to supply to big chains who has predictable and higher volume. Margins for the shops have over the years narrowed. Many items SLS shops sells they profit by sheer volume than proft per item.</p>
              <p>This phenomenon has happened in US and Canada, the mom-pop business are literally wiped out. You buy your electronics from either Best Buy, Wal-mart. They will sell you at full price and only from time to time offer you rebates.</p>
              <p>What the big names in singapore is doing is to lure you into buying from them by offering you ridiculous freebies, and 0% interest.</p>
              <p><br>These freebies are normally offered in official promotions. SLS loses out in 0% interest because they are a predominantly cash business and the majority of consumers now ain't cash buyers.</p>
