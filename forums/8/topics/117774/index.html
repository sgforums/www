            <div class='col-md body'>Recently i've decided to pick up a hobby that allows me to waste time.. er productively. Since i'm waiting for exam results, i've decided to pick up fishing. I need some advise on fishing!! Like.. what sort of line should i get.. what type of rod n stuff.. I heard that the line dont have to get a powerful one, just can take abt 11lbs or something, cos sg fish are mostly quite small???<br><br>P.S- Most impt of all, where to find a good place to get quality fishing accessories? Thanks  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Damage abt $12-15 bucks get @ beach rd, geylang or changi<br><br>reel: simple one with 10-15pound line will do, sometime they bundle the reel and rod together mebbe all in $20-$25 or less, best place to hunt for bargains is beach rd.<br><br>lead stone or fishing weignts: pls dun go buy monster size stone hor small small will do, best is get a few used spark plug from garage or HDB carpark sometimes can find le.<br><br>swivel: some small swivel can le, 1 packet 80c - $1.2<br><br>Hooks: get those already tied hook jig lines for catching small fish, 1 packet abt $1.2, get abt 3 packets enuf le. Buy those with the smallest hooks<br><br>Location: Favorite place for 70%-80% chance of catching fish East Coast Bedok Jetty. Go daytime preferbly just after a heavy rain for best results and very fast action the taban will be most hungry by then. The bad thing abt this place is getting there are no toilets ard, only bushes nearby but have to quar jwee as there are women blader and joggers ard. Bring own food and water.<br><br>Location: Other place is clifford pier, but patience waiting game this place you need totally different equipment, hit chance low 20-30% but there are monsters, meter long size kim bak lor have been fished out before. Good thing   abt clifford pier is easy transport since it's smack in town area, there is also a public toilet, a mama shop to buy titbits, a small pau/timsum shop if you hungry and if you bored can walk over to look at KTV girl singing at nearby open air lounge. Or if you thirsty just hop on to a floating pub moored closeby. But as I say this place is patience game.<br><br>Location: Tanjung Berlayer(aka Labrador Park)<br>This place is quite good, tamban and other fish hit chance abt 40%-60%, toilet also nt very far, transport a bit hassle unless you drive but still within walking distance from main rd. But the biggest downside is the hot sun, the whole jetty has been refurbished but there is only 1 or 2 shelters on the jetty and most of the time occupied by regulars so have to share. Have to bring own food and drinks though there is an ah pek occasionally selling ice-cream on his bike, by 6pm you shud leave because it gets dark &amp; ppl say hantu(though been there so many x nvr seen any)<br><br>For newbie fishermen best is to head out to bedok jetty and get yourself trained &amp; hooked to the hobby before venturing elsewhere enjoy har.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for the advise. Anyway it is true that its quite hard to get a big catch through shore fishing.. my friend who has been fishing for yrs ard east side caught only a 1.5kg catfish or something, which was the biggest he caught so far. For bait, he bought cheap fresh prawns and cut them up to pieces. It seems that most of the fish he caught using prawns are catfish. Anyway whats that yellow tail, silvery fish that we use to eat for dinner?<br><br>For location another of my friend found a good spot around changi airport. It is rather deserted as it is along the airport runway and the only way you can reach there is by cyclying or driving (not advisable as no where to park and lots of police car patrolling ard the airport area). There is a monsoon drain there and several breakwaters. Nice fishing spot if you dont mind the mosquitos and insects. Bring along old newspapers to sit on or a foldable stool. Possible to catch several freshwater fish, n of course lotsa longkang fish.</div>
