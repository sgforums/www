Oh so that both the incidence of homosexuality increasing in the past 40 years and the population explosion that happened in the past 40 years are just one big coincidence?<br><br>And u would REALLY rather face natural disasters and epidemics than have homosexuals within your species? Besides, natural disasters have always happened, whether there were humans or not. To argue that natural disasters themselves are a means of population control is really.... not very thinking. Epidemics would at least make more sense, but who says that every method that mother nature uses needs to be painful and cruel?</div>

Aren't the thread starter asking if it is RIGHT OR WRONG!? Then I guess in all mainstream opinion its Wrong to be a gay.

The reasons why we are overpopulated simply because, our species had evolved under this circumstances over the many thousands of years. We are customised to survive from extinction. Survive from all kinds of sickness etc. Why don't you read up about evolution theory abit.(although I'm not a favourite fan of darwin) Using homosexuality is a bloody excuse. Homosexuality serve no purpose for the well being of our species. And most of the time is a by product of a abused, twarted individuals.  Who suffered emotional tramas or misleaded sexually.<br><br>Our decision and emotions are much based on our experieces.</div></blockquote>boom! Your ignorance just sunk your logic.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Yes many animal species have shown well documented homosexual behaviour. No not just oysters, but everything from turtles to giraffes to gorillas and monkeys and birds. Species with a clearly defined male and female members of the species. In fact, 90% of giant gorillas are homosexual, and have been doing fine until human poachers came along.<br><br>U wanna argue here, better make sure u're not as ignorant as a door post. It just makes u look dumber.<br><br>And look at u, and your intense dislike for homosexuals. Look at how u let that sort of hate affect your life. Makes us wonder who the REAL abused and twisted individuals here are. Makes us wonder who is the real misguided one. U know a misguided social conditioning can be overcome with some hard thinking, why don't u try it? It's very liberating.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
