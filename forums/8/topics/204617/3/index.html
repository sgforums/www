            <div class='col-md body'>Because being gay is just not rite. Nowadays, ppl are getting affluent.They need not fret about having nowhere to eat and no place to stay. Tt is why ppl have time to ponder about their sexuality and stuff. I mean have you ever seen gay prehistoric men before? They were to busy trying to survive to think about such stuff. Just find a mate, have children and go. Look at our closest genetic relatives. Have u ever seen gay gorillas or gay monkeys before? No? Well, they too are too busy surviving to think about it. If every species was gay then whose gonna have younglings for the next generation?<br><br>The majority ppl are not gay, and ppl are scared of  others who are different from them. Tt is why ppl are apprehended about accepting them. If Alexander the great is ruling the world now, I can assure you, gays wil be recognised lawfully and given their rights.<br><br>PS: Not tt im super anti or anything, just stating point of view. I am open minded about such stuff.hee...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess in the point of view for both science and religion. Homo relationship is wrong...<br><br>Anything that defies the reproduction and survival of the species defies science and evolution theory. Simply all creatures comes with the ability to survive and continue. We needn't even get into religion.<br><br>People able to pull off the stuns in the past simply because they have the power and influence to do so. For example Richard the Lionheart and even france's duke during Joan de arc. Not that the culture allows but because he is the king. Normal people who are caught homosexual will have to face death by the church. With those kinda torture device that split the anus open. This explain that in the past there are social cultures that forbid this. Particularly in the Chinese and Middle Eastern Society. And the example which you put are isolated. Simply they have to power to do things without consequence.<br><br>Greek, and Roman are one of those society that has not yes and not in it. And it doesn't prove Alexander the Great is a gay. In greek the only city that forbid gay simply because they viewed gay as a sign of weakness is Sparta. But in their tough regieme of Discipline. There are still isolated incidents of intercourse between man in the field due to urge.<br><br>This explain that Although there are stories of gay activities in the past in many culture doesn't mean it is generally accepted! The examples which you pull are just a face of the coin. Doesn't tell the whole story.</div>
