Gays are nature's way of controlling population, what the society or government thinks, is self-centred, it is either solely for the progress of the country, or to keep from shame when being associated with a gay. Society and Government do not think in the Earth's context.<br><br>Hence dont come and use law, religion and society to come and justify gays, you are jus following blindly around this self-centred non-existant rules and regulations.</div></blockquote>1) You ever notice only humans have gays?<br><br>We are not talking about oyesters.. they are either sexes...<br>Over reproduction is bad but that's our natural gift.

My parents for example.. what am I going to tell them? That I'm gay and they have no hopes of having any grand children? Or to my friends? Will they accept me if they found out? Man.. there is so many things to worry about on top of other mundane nonsense in life it down right SUCKS. So please.. please don't judge because that conservative brain of yours cannot begin to understand.<br><br>Whether homosexuality is nature's way of population control only god knows so there is no point discussing it.<br><br>And BTW a word of advice, try to be more open minded about such things because whether you like it or not there will be gay people around you -- be it at work or at school and if you react the way you write then your just gonna offend lots of people.<br></div></blockquote>A long way to go indeed...</div>

The gay population isn't exactly big u know. And most of em are hiding in the closet. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>MissQi u say ur half gay but ur arguing like you were gay since u were born. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>People don't get me wrong. I don't openly condemn homosexuality. But i don't understand why some guys in clubs have to let me know they are gay. It's increasingly irritating, not to mention a turn-off...anyone watched Irreversible? One day, if some faggot comes on too hard, i might have to bash his head in with a fire extinguisher too.<br><br>As for lesbians, not much of a problem, but when u have to fight with a BUTCH for a girlfriend, wah knn something is damn phucking wrong. I can launch a tirade against butches, but deep down i know they are just a sad and confused insecure bunch of people, so i'll let it rest here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
