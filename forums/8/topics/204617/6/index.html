Earth is currently facing a very endangering problem of overpopulation, consuming our resources mad fast, do you think if there were no gays and everyone was straight, that the world will be what it is today?<br><br>If the population grows and grows like gays never existed at all, I dont think we will be existing now, because i believe the Earth's resources would have already depleted centuries ago. Gays are nature's way of controlling population, what the society or government thinks, is self-centred, it is either solely for the progress of the country, or to keep from shame when being associated with a gay. Society and Government do not think in the Earth's context.<br><br>Hence dont come and use law, religion and society to come and justify gays, you are jus following blindly around this self-centred non-existant rules and regulations.</div></blockquote>From the reponses we can see see who are pro gays. You want to be a FAG or CAG, heys its your choice. But I think you "guys" should stick to your forum for your kind. Go sgboys lah.<br><br>Don't come here and start saying nonsense like being gay is nature's way of controlling the population. Where did you get your facts?<br><br>And true lor some animals have the ability to change their sexes. BUT its for reproduction ok. Male AND Female. Not Male and Male like your kind.<br><br>Gays nowadays got this ability meh?? Can keep switching sexes back and forth meh?? Yah , you can become a girl loh. But once you snip snip there's no turning back. But can you get pregnant and give birth?? NO. Is it against nature to behave like you do, YES.<br><br>And don't forget the sexual dieases associated with gays. If you mean AIDS is the way of cutting down the population, then ok, you win lor.<br><br>In the eyes of morals, law, religion, nature, being gay is wrong. Live with it. Please remember that anal sex here is against the law. Don't forget, your acceptance in the world today, it's because people have to. Not because they want to.<br><br></div>
