            <div class='col-md body'>Its funny that all the guys who keep insisting its wrong to be gay because sex is only used for reproduction don't stop to think how many times they've worn a condom, and all the girls who keep insisting it's wrong don't stop to think how many times their partners have worn a condom.<br><br>Hey if the vagina is the proper hole for sperm, how come u guys need to wear a condom to keep it out of that hole?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>And oh, I love to see the brainless morons who think anyone who are pro-gay are gay themselves. Unfortunately, u need to leave your well and realise there are many straight people who have a deep sense of justice, and CAN see the sort of injustice done by homophobic people, and decide to speak up against it, and there are many who are secure in their own sexuality and see no need to bash gays just to convince themselves they are straight.<br><br>I wonder if those homophobic people bash gays so hard because they so badly do not wish to have to face up to the fact that they ARE something they've been told is "wrong" since young. Well, lying to oneself has never been effective, and u might as well realise that sooner than later.</div>
