Simply they have to power to do things without consequence.<br><br>Greek, and Roman are one of those society that has not yes and not in it. And it doesn't prove Alexander the Great is a gay. In greek the only city that forbid gay simply because they viewed gay as a sign of weakness is Sparta. But in their tough regieme of Discipline.

Earth is currently facing a very endangering problem of overpopulation, consuming our resources mad fast, do you think if there were no gays and everyone was straight, that the world will be what it is today?<br><br>If the population grows and grows like gays never existed at all, I dont think we will be existing now, because i believe the Earth's resources would have already depleted centuries ago.
