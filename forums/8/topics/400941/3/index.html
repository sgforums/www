              <p>Well, i'm not forcing you to accept SG guys, lol, if you think
              they're shamless, overrated themselves watever then so be it. Its
              your mind and you have the right to have your own views. Then go
              find some guys of other nationality, it's a open market out
              there.</p>
              <p>Actually there're not many girls who is in the top 10%
              category but there're many girls who 'think' they're in
              that category. Just like man i suppose.</p>
              <p>I'm just hope they can think 'logically', and the guys they have
              desired is of course desired by other girls as well, and it must
              have a reason for they to be chosen and not their fellow female
              friends. Love is unrealistic but in a way it's also very
              realistic. </p>
              <p>Well, you can continue dreaming on, and chances are, you'll be
              joining the ever growing group of single woman that is becoming
              more and more nowadays. Of couse you can blame SG guys for that
              too, isnt it? lol</p>
              <p>I agree with you that i'm not ready to fall deep in love and i
              actually think i'm not suitable to be in any relationship. I don't
              even bother to find girls nowadays as i think there're much more
              important issues in life, places to travel, things to learn,
              culture to see and problems to solve.</p>

              <p>WHEN you work 15-hour days, chances are, it is not easy to find a
              girlfriend. Indeed, that was the case for fruit-seller Soon Sze Han,
              46, who logged long, punishing hours at Pasir Panjang Wholesale Market.<br><br>'Any woman will be scared off by my working hours,' said the 46-year-old.<br><br>But
              he was keen to get married. So, three years ago, Mr Soon, who had never
              dated, walked into a matchmaking agency to explore the possibility.<br><br>Of
              the three Vietnamese women he met there, he chose one from a village in
              Ho Chi Minh City. Aged 25, she was 18 years his junior.<br><br>'She was the oldest there already. I walked by and she winked at me,' he said.</p>
              <p>They married in December 2006 and now live in a three-room flat in Chinatown with his parents.<br><br>Matchmaking agencies said such marriages between couples where there is a big age gap are common.<br><br>More proof of such unions has come from the National Population Secretariat (NPS).<br><br>Last
              week, it revealed that marriages between men above 40 and
              non-Singaporean women doubled from 18 per cent in 1998 to 35 per cent
              last year.<br><br>Of these marriages, four-fifths of the brides are
              aged under 40. Over 90 per cent of them are from Asia, though the NPS
              did not specify the countries.</p>

              <p>it's possible to find a korean guys in her category...but, would

              Bascially, people from different social classes shouldn't marry
