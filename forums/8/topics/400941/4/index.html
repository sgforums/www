              <p><strong>Half-blind man nearly lost everything to China bride </strong><br> <br> First, she threatened to get the police to arrest him if he refused to
              marry her. When he finally relented, she made him sign a document
              willing his home and all his assets to her.<br> <br> Mr Liang, 62, who is blind in one eye, told a Shin Min Daily News
              reporter that he first met the China woman at a coffee shop near his
              home in 2004. His wife had passed away ten years earlier in 1994.<br> <br> He said that she came up to him and introduced herself as a beautician from China and said that she wanted to be his friend.<br> <br> The woman, who is 11 years younger than Mr Liang, told him that she was
              a divorcee, and that her ex-husband and daughter are in China.<br> <br> Mr Liang said that the woman was very nice to him when they first met. However, things took a drastic change three months later.<br> <br> "She told me that she wanted me to marry her. Should I refuse, she
              would report me to the police, accusing me of treating her badly and
              cheating her of her feelings."<br> <br> As he had no knowledge about the penal code, Mr Liang took the China
              woman's threats for real and agreed to the marriage. He also listened
              to her instructions, asking him to keep his children in the dark about
              the nuptials.<br> <br> "It was only at the Registry of Marriages did I realize that we needed
              two witnesses." Mr Liang told Shin Min, "I called my daughter, telling
              her I needed her as my witness, but she refused."<br> <br> In the end, Mr Liang managed to get a male relative and a friend of the China woman's to witness their marriage registration.<br> <br> It was only months later that Mr Liang's children learned of their father's marriage.<br> <br> Despite acceding to her request, Mr Liang found that married life was
              no better. His new wife refused to work, and constantly asked him for
              money.<br> <br> When his salary as a cleaner failed to satisfy his wife's needs, Mr Liang found himself asking his daughter for money.<br> <br> The former cleaner also blamed his new wife for his partial loss of
              sight. Mr Liang said that he was suffering from glaucoma and cataracts,
              but his condition was in check as his daughter would take him to the
              doctor regularly.<br> <br> When he remarried, his China wife assumed the responsibility, but
              failed to bring Mr Liang for treatment after the first time. By 2008,
              Mr Liang lost all sight in his right eye and was unable to work.<br> <br> According to a doctor's report, Mr Liang's loss of sight was attributed to the neglect of his condition.<br> <br> In early 2007, Mr Liang's new wife forced him to sign a document
              written in English. When Mr Liang indicated that he did not understand
              its contents, she refused to translate it for him.<br> <br> When he brought it to a neighbour, Mr Liang was horrified to learn that
              it was an agreement stating that he had willed his $300,000 three-room
              flat as well as his CPF and bank savings to her.<br> <br> However, as Mr Liang's children were aware of the agreement, the China
              woman did not benefit from it during the divorce proceedings.</p>

              <p>Best of all. When foriegn woman start to marry all the man at
                                      the age of 28 to 32. It's already prove one thing ! Singapore woman
                                      nobody want ! Left on the shelf. They spolt their own market. So
                                      for man who is young now. Age 21 to 27. It's really time for you to
                                      planning. Who you want to be your life partner ? When you getting
                                      married ? When you going to have children ? It's really time to
                                      start. Get a life !<br> <br> Tell the Singapore woman, It's time for you to get a better man.
                                      Singapore man no longer fit for you. Singapore man salary is just
                                      too low. $2500 to $3500 is not human salary. It's slave salary.
                                      Singapore woman should find man who have $10,000 or $20,000 or even
                                      $100,000 dollars salary per month. Or business man above ! Or even
                                      minister !<br> <br> Singapore man ! Get on to your life. Trust me. You be happier then
                                      be SINGLE ! Then when you reach 38,39. Finding vietnam bride.
                                      People say you "BUYING A WIFE ! NO LOVE ONE ". Why not do it when
                                      you are 28 ? What can they say Now ? Is the Singapore woman losing
                                      all their attraction ? Or... is Singapore man all low-wages
                                      labourors ?</p>
