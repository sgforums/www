              <p>I'm lazy to log onto there to post comments,  but to any girls who share similar views, i wanna ask you a few questions,</p>
              <p>1) Take a look into the mirror, do you think you are among the top 10% in terms of skin condition, hair, look, character, body smell, gracefulness, body shape, sexyness or watever that appeals to man? If not, why are you under the illusion that man who are among the top will choose you as their gf? It's a realistic world out that, just like it's normal for girls to choose guys with high income, it's definitely normal for guys who have a higher income to set a high standards for their gf, especially since girls will be swarming over him given his status.</p>
              <p>2) Of course you can dream that there'll be a guy who fits into all your criteria and just happens to love you only, but what are the chances? Do some simple calculation and tell yourself what is the chances of a guy who happens to be rich and innocent, devoted (in another words, those guys who are so frequently shown in taiwanese/korean/japanese idol dramas), wat are the chances of them existing in real life and you happen to be the girl lead? its damned low, in fact, you have a much higher chance of getting cancer, accident if you compare the odds.</p>
              <p>You're just a normal girl living a normal life in a small country, you're not some supermodel, celebrity, royal family heir etc</p>
              <p>Yup, it's okay to have a cinderalla dream once in a while, but once the dream is over you have to WAKE UP.</p>
              <p>I'm just being realistic.</p>

              <p>Well, i'm not forcing you to accept SG guys, lol, if you think they're shamless, overrated themselves watever then so be it. Its your mind and you have the right to have your own views. Then go find some guys of other nationality, it's a open market out there.</p>
              <p>Actually there're not many girls who is in the top 10% category but there're many girls who 'think' they're in that category. Just like man i suppose.</p>
              <p>I'm just hope they can think 'logically', and the guys they have desired is of course desired by other girls as well, and it must have a reason for they to be chosen and not their fellow female friends. Love is unrealistic but in a way it's also very realistic. </p>
              <p>Well, you can continue dreaming on, and chances are, you'll be joining the ever growing group of single woman that is becoming more and more nowadays. Of couse you can blame SG guys for that too, isnt it? lol</p>
              <p>I agree with you that i'm not ready to fall deep in love and i actually think i'm not suitable to be in any relationship. I don't even bother to find girls nowadays as i think there're much more important issues in life, places to travel, things to learn, culture to see and problems to solve.</p>
