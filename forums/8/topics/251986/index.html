However, confidence comes only with self understanding and acceptance. You must be comfortable with who you are, then you will feel that 'its ok i'm not perfect'.. when u feel that, you have less fear sharing yourself genuinely with the people around you.<br><br>there are some people who are not comfortable with themselves but try very hard to be 'extroverted' You can recognise them a mile off.. and u dont understand that little 'wierd' feeling why u never feel comfortable with them. Why issit some extroverts are 'natural' and some are not? In the end it really lies with how genuine you are.. being yourself is more important and more likeable than anything else <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It appears to me that you are simply an introverted individual. Being introverted doesn't mean you suck at EQ. And don't put too much trust on those online quizzes and tests. They mostly wouldn't be giving you an accurate assessment of yourself anyway.</div>

Immense urself in cca, passion and mold your own character through interaction with others.It is like learning to ride a bicycle. You will fall a few times and slowly you'll get the hang of it. If you don't try and dare to reach out, you will never learn how to ride a bicycle.<br><br>I feel the key word is learn to <strong>accept urself</strong> as who you are; with all its imperfections. How you treat yourself reflects on how you treat others. If you want others to start accepting you, you have to feel comfortable in your own skin and accept yourself as whom you are.<br><br>I would say stop judging urself and start to nourish and encourage urself positively. Love yourself unconditionally with all its flaws and u will find urself change for the better... it works most of the time.<br></div>
