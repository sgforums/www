            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway, i find that there itsn't not much difference between JC and poly. Only thing is that JC is a much condensed follow up of secondary school where your main aim is to get into one of the 3 unis here.On the other hand  poly is a place where you can focus on a particular subject that you want to do and their main aim is to prepare you for working life. Of course in both cases, they will lead you to a university. It just depends on how hard you want to work for it.<br><br>Most importantly, follow your passion whether you are in poly or Jc. Otherwise, without passion, nothing is achievable.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually u should be thinking about what u want to be in future??? what is your interest and is that one going to provide u with enough bread to eat..... nowadays even if u go poly u still have to completed your degree sooner or later, and think about u got the money to go overseas after poly.. coz if u are interested in business or mass comm, competition is high for a place in local u..so mostly likely u need to go overseas for ur degree.. so think first if u got the money or not lor... local uni is alot cheap... and if u havent decide what u want to be??? then my advice is.. stay in jc... enjoy ur 2yrs there jio all the gal u want and see all the gal zaogeng lor... poly gal not as easy to jio as jc one. haha</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>understand the difference between studying in a poly and a jc 1st.<br><br>in JC, you're just doing the same things you did in pri and sec sch; general subjects, albeit more advanced ones, but still do not serve you any good in a working environment.<br><br>in poly, you're training for the job that you would like to do, provided you get into the course you want.<br><br>it depends on how patient you are. do you want to train for your dream job now? or do you wish to wait another 4 years? (JC + NS. and even then, you might not make it into a local university.)<br><br>lastly. a degree is not necessary. neither is it a means to an end.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if u intend to further ur studies in future, and if u choose to go poly, make sure u can be hardworking and maintain ur results... in poly there's more of a tendency to slack and ur results must be good EVERY semester so that it looks good cumulatively<br><br>if u go jc, u juz have to pia for ur A levels... it isn't as hard as in poly in the sense that some students can slack for 1 and a half years and then study very very hard for A levels<br><br>another point that u might want to take note of, poly students don't stand as high a chance to get a scholarship into uni unless ur results and cca records are very outstanding... but on the other hand, u gain a better foundation when u eventually study in uni as compared to the jc students<br><br>don't feel that becos u did well in O levels it will be a waste if u go poly... it will be more of a waste if u go ahead and do something u don't like<br><br></div>

Business, sales and mkting basically are very general stuff.. hence a biz degree usually is a general one. which can be good and bad. mass comm is more specialized. nowadays job markets so volatile, u may not even get what you are trained for.. i.e. i was from science, then go do engieering in uni. but lucky i come out doing engineering.. so at least related.. but a lot of times, i see my friends doing something else..<br><br>but another point to note is that fact is that now nothing is secure and then fees for uni so exp and get out also may not satisfy what u were aiming for originally, poly grad seem to be more in demand.. and i think even going poly dun shut u off from taking the next step as degree.. but then the usual thing is the prestige of taking the jc-uni route... seems more established and usually scholars and those who make headlines come from there..</div>

ACCA is internationally recognised and it consider a part master degree in some countries but that is if u want to go overseas work lah.. in sg.. alot of government stats board dun recognised it actually.. to them u just have a cert that is better or like diploma.. and not a degree.. e.g MOE u cant go NIE with it unless u want to be treated as a diploma holder lor.. and for farther studies like if u want to do your masters.. ntu and nus dun recognised it again...for work wise not so bad lah beside GLC lah...so if u want to do it.. good luck lor.. passing rate is about 50% on average...</div>
