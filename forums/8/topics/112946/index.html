It crept up to 1.7 in 1979 and 3.7 by 1999.<br><br>Dr Chia, 68, earned a doctorate in social medicine in 1980 by researching suicide in Singapore. This was on top of his medical degree.<br><br>He has also spent more than 30 years of his life studying whatever court files he can lay his hands on involving unnatural deaths, poring over police, medical and pathologists' reports.<br><br>'Today, collecting data on suicide has grown into a hobby,' he told The Sunday Times.<br><br>His interest in suicide is largely as a psychiatrist and statistician; he stops short of providing pat explanations. 'Suicide is too complex for that,' he said.<br><br>He started tracking suicidal female teenagers here in earnest when a 1994 international study ranked the suicide rate of Singapore's females aged 15 to 24 the fourth highest in the world. The top three are hard-living former communist countries like rural China, Lithuania and Kazakhstan.<br><br>In the same age category, Singapore's young males ranked a more middling 33rd position among the 50 countries studied.<br><br>This bucks the pattern elsewhere, Dr Chia said.<br><br>In most countries, men are more likely to succeed in killing themselves, while women attempt suicide more often, but less successfully.<br><br>In Singapore, however, the odds of dying are even for both sexes because most Singaporeans choose the easy and lethal method of jumping to their deaths from high-rise buildings.<br><br>His statistics showed that 70 per cent of those who committed suicide here between 2000 and 2002 leapt to their deaths, usually from their common corridor, kitchen or bedroom. The rest hang, gas, poison, burn or drown themselves.<br><br>Between 300 and 400 people take their own lives here each year.<br><br></div>

Of course all of us would know what it was because of the smell of it.<br><br>The officers were quite lenient towards him because they know that he wasn't that steady up there, but after a while they gave in and threatened to charge him.  Thats when he reacted negatively.  Well, to be fair, maybe it wasn't this case itself, maybe it was the whole depression of being 'trapped and owned' whilst in uniform.<br><br>He wasn't an alcoholic or mafia-type of guy....just a very quiet, normal, decent looking chap, studious-looking even - wearing specs, etc.  Actually, besides his beer-drinking compulsion, he was quite a nice and pleasant person to be with.  We all had nothing against him, really.  We kind pitied him, in fact.<br><br>After his survival, he even could joke about with us that he should have chosen a classier building like Westin, etc.  Idiot per se.  Argh!!!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Where do you stay gentlerock, sounded like condo.  Maybe I can phone you when I feel like jumping but I believe that its just too ugly to end that way but then its fast.<br><br>Anyways, I identified with the wanting to end it all.  I think less guys want to end in sucide unless they are disturbed cause usually they would rather become violent against something/someone/everything/everyone. They tended to fantasise about hurting/beating/even killing the person or thing tat gave them troubles in the first place. However, for women, its tended to be self inflicted (most cases) where by these people seek addiction/vices/permiscuous lifestyle or sucide. to forget/rid of the problem/person etc.  But its a lie and they know its a lie and they are just waiting for something to catch up and get them one way or another.<br><br>I know this will strike people as weird and will definitely freak people out. It takes more effort for a person to go solve issues, confront problems than just to end it all so as to never have to face it again. I had constantly freak out my friends with my constant fanatasy about dying and how I should die to be painless and etc (I have even better plans than jumping down westin).  Many will think its weird for such thoughts and cannot accept it. But for me, I feel a calm and relief when I think about dying as if its my destiny. I envision myself in coffin and I can smile about it cause to me, its the end of suffering, pain and endless hellish cycles in lifes I have to bear. and no matter how much I change or work at being happy, I find that again and again, I am being tested as if I'm an experiment and my life is so worthless to be treated as so. I guess its the people nowadays who are all so detached and see it as nothing to destroy another person in their career/life/whatever. I think today's society excerbated the issues. Its actually a release from this life to die. Sometimes, for me, its a daily constant daily struggle just to be normal. I know I get depressed fairly easily and I can even tell if I am or not, but medication is never the answer. If you had been depressed once (a real one, not the sulking tantrums people have), you will know the darkness and its power and how near the edge you will walk and how tempting death becomes.  Its very easy to slip into depression once you had your first.<br><br>I always admire people with a positive disposition.  But people who are prone to negativity must come to accept their nature or they will walk the way of sucide.<br><br>But people will never understand...</div>
