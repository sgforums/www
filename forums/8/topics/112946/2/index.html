Depressed people are so down that often they don't even have the energy to kill themselves. Then they seek help to get out of depression. Once they get a little better, have the energy but still in depression with sucidial tendencies, ironically this is when they act out their sucides.<br></div>

Of course all of us would know what it was because of the smell of it.<br><br>The officers were quite lenient towards him because they know that he wasn't that steady up there, but after a while they gave in and threatened to charge him.  Thats when he reacted negatively.  Well, to be fair, maybe it wasn't this case itself, maybe it was the whole depression of being 'trapped and owned' whilst in uniform.<br><br>He wasn't an alcoholic or mafia-type of guy....just a very quiet, normal, decent looking chap, studious-looking even - wearing specs, etc.  Actually, besides his beer-drinking compulsion, he was quite a nice and pleasant person to be with.  We all had nothing against him, really.

One was a bit cuckoo (landed just 5 metres from my car), the other was dumped by her angmoh bf (landed just below my balcony, just one minute before my car was supposed to pass by).  SPLAT!  Not a pretty sight, with brains and blood everywhere....and legs which bend at such weird angles.<br><br>I've always been suspicious of statistics, media reports, experts' reports, etc.  I've seen so many which were either exaggerated or totally untrue.  Sometimes, I trust my own eyes, ears and gut-feelings more.  I guess its also how statistics are compiled which influence the outcome/results.  Maybe the study didn't include countries like Japan, Hong Kong, Thailand, etc.  Or maybe foreign women wait till after their 24th birthday to jump, I don't know.<br><br>I still have the impression that the young women suicide rate in Japan is much higher than here (the usual falling-out-of-love reasons).  Damned jialat you know?  You tell her "bye-bye", she says "baka! watashi wa supah-man!" and that was it.  I have Japanese friends/relatives who tell me that in their area, they sometimes had as many as 2-3 cases per month (and this figure didn't include the guys yet)....though its getting much less in recent years.<br><br>I also have the impression that there must be some countries which fit in between Japan and Singapore too (although its remains as just a feeling - can't prove it).<br><br>Oh, oh, I gotta tell you about this guy, my army platoon mate, who decided that he didn't wanna live no more.  So he jumped from our bunk (4th story) and landed on the veranda (2nd story).  What an idiot.  Needless to say, he lived to laugh about it.....till he found out that he would be court martialled for attempted suicide.<br><br>Incidentally, if any of you live in my block and intend to end it all, please have some consideration and watch out for my car first.
