            <div class='col-md body'>There r quite a few things which I have done, which I would classify as touching. Nothing extraordinary or material. Just little, little things. May not matter to some...<br><br>1. Staying up the whole night, just so that I can wake her up at 5am to study for exam. I was afraid I myself cannot wake up if I went to sleep.<br><br>2. Summarise and write down every lecture into study cards and give to her to help her in her work. This was when we were in university taking the same courses. Did it for 2 modules, for every lecture for 1 whole semester!<br><br>3. Staying up the night before to summarise and write down into point form a management subject, which we are supposed to take the exam the next day. Meet up early with her so that she can read those notes. This one most siong coz not only stay up whole night b4 the exam, but wrote so much the night b4 that my whole hand was aching during the exam! And worse is exam itself must answer 4 essay questions!<br><br>4. Telling her that she is beautiful. She is!<br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.</div>
