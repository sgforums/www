            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>In Dec 03Â’, my family went shopping at Harvey Norman, Millenia Walk. We had just moved into a new flat. We purchased a single bed frame made of metal that comes with wooden strips as the baseboard. We also purchased a mattress. We had asked the sales girl if the wood would have any worms or pests/bugs and was assured that it was treated with chemicals so the possibility of it was minimal and should not occur. This put our mind at ease and we bought it immediately. However, 3 months later, on the 30th of March 2004, I started to notice little black particles (bugs) jumping &amp; hopping around my bedroom. The source of it was from the bedÂ’s wooden strip!  I immediately called Harvey Norman, telling them the problem and requested their assistance.<br><br>On the 1st of April, they sent staff down to take photos but refused to remove the bed-set. Although disappointed, my mum wrapped the wooden strips in newspaper, to prevent the bugs from spreading. I could not help her because I am disabled (muscular dystrophy) and this made me even more frustrated as the staff did not offer any assistance seeing our position.<br><br>I called up Harvey Norman right away to demand that they take the bed-set away immediately. A pest controller was sent to take a look. To my horror, he said that these wood bugs reproduce very fast and on spraying insecticide may be totally killed off after 30 days! I hoped that with this information Harvey Norman would aid in getting some help to us.<br><br>I strongly demanded Harvey Norman to get their staff to remove the bed from our house. Instead of being sympathetic, they offered to remove the bed for a fee of $40. Furthermore it could not be done on the same day. It seemed as though they were more concerned of being libel if they touched the bed, instead of having simple decency and courtesy to delivering a service, that Singapore is supposed to be famous for, to their customer. It seemed after-sales service is not a priority for Harvey Norman.<br><br>After repeated phone calls one of the sales-persons, Florence, got it removed for us free of charge. She told us to come down to Harvey Norman to buy another bed set at a special price. This I believed would be a direct exchange. She apologised profusely and kept emphasising that the bugs were not from their bed set. Naturally, we were very unhappy and disappointed that this could happen to a brand new bed after only three months.<br><br>We made the trip down with the hope of some assistance and also wishing to put this inconvenience to rest finally. We met up with Mr Danny Lau, the Retail Manager, and of the Bedding Department. He gave us a look that told us that he was not going to be very helpful. He was extremely condescending and kept repeating to us that he was doing us a favour. He added that the pest investigator was his friend and went down to look at my bed as a favour. This made us suspicious as the pest investigator had not helped but kept repeating that the bugs had not come from the wood but was actually from the air or had just waltzed right in from the surroundings. Mr Lau reiterated that the wood was infested because of dampness in the room and the bugs may have come through the air. This meant that every piece of wood in my house would be affected, logically. I explained that if the room was damp or if the pests were indeed air born, then why werenÂ’t my table, cupboards &amp; other wood furniture in the house affected?<br><br>We are also very concerned that our parquet floor could be infested with these bugs. He could not give a satisfactory answer saying his 10 yrs experience in dealing with wood meant I could not possibly understand the nature of this unique pest. Yet the fact that he has such a lot of experience dealing with it should be more alarming for everyone. If this is the way Mr Lau deals with the numerous cases he must have had due to his vast experience, then many Singaporeans have been made unhappy over the past ten or so years.<br><br>My claim was that since the only thing infected so far was the furniture (baseboard and mattress) purchased from Harvey Norman, they should be responsible for it. Again it was claimed that the wood is not to blame. The bed was now equivalent to junk and was infected terribly not anything else. Mr Lau was unable to give a new or replacement. He offered a new bed at a reduced price (cost price). He even had the cheek to say that he could give us another bed for free but did not want to as it was against his principles. This left us with a seething feeling of frustration and dissatisfaction. He was mocking us. Making us feels like he had the power of God over us-to give us a new bed or not. That I had to pay again for something that was damaged through no fault of mine was unbelievable. He further insulted us by advising us on bed maintenance, as though we had been sleeping on the floor for the past 30 years. He also told us that we should aerate the room. At night the air-conditioner is used whilst I sleep.  During the day the door is kept open to the house air. If the bedÂ’s wood is so special it seems like Singaporeans would not be able to maintain any bed of that type as our climate is humid and damp naturally. One would have to customise the conditions of the room to suit and maintain such a bed. If this was indeed the case, why werenÂ’t we informed of the Â‘specialÂ’ conditioning required to own and maintain such a bed?<br><br>I now have to share my mumÂ’s bed, as we are worried that if the new bed set is placed in the Â‘bugÂ’ room, it may become infected as well.<br><br>This whole incident has deeply saddened my family and myself as we feel that no compassion or understanding was shown to us, the customer. Mr Lau, with all his years of handling pests and wood infections has been nothing but Â“helpfulÂ” by not helping at all. We were made to travel up and down unnecessarily without any reward or understanding. Travelling for me is a big problem as well due to my handicap. Much time and money was spent on travelling and in the end we had to pay for another bed. It all seems unnecessary yet it seemed very necessary for Mr Lau to put us down and make us look down on Harvey NormanÂ’s after sales care.<br><br>One thing is for sure; we will not buy another product from Harvey Norman. Their service is extremely poor and cannot possibly compete with any other department store or furniture shop.<br></div>

I would NOT let Harvey Norman get away with that.<br><br>Is your first post the letter/email you sent to the newspaper? It's kinda long and would take up a lot of space in a newspaper for a single complaint. I suspect they would rather leave out your letter and print more letters. Just be to the point, mention what happened and leave out all unneccassary stuff. Space is money in newspapers.<br><br>What really irked me in your case is the attitude of the arrogant manager. Why talk to him at all? Demand to talk to a superior, afterall you were a paying customer. If all else fails, there's always <strong>The New Paper</strong>. Stuff like this might make headlines on a day without worthy news. Call them, let them send their reporters down, and they'll do what they do best, blow things out of proportion <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I bought my bed from there as well though 2 years before you. It is still fine, without any bugs. Maybe yours is an isolated case.<br><br>But still, i agree that the manager shouldn't treat customers that way. The suggestions have been given and i personally feel we cannot let this kind of matter rest like that. It might cause more displeasure to other people next time.<br><br>I do hope your complaints get through. Probably Harvey Norman ain't exactly the better bed furniture stall. A lesson learnt.
