For example, if the group is a Protestant denomination, and the authority made up manly of Catholics, or the rejected group, being a charismatic church, accusing the established Catholic and Protestant mainstream churches of prejudice, so on and so on.<br><br><blockquote><strong>What does COC actually do?

Perhaps you should change the name to something more ambiguous... I would suggest "Spiritually Rich Harvest" "Urban Harvest"<br><br>Furthermore, it might be unhealthy to label your followers as "idiots" or suckers, no matter how accurate the term might be.

Roman Catholics are more traditional and follow quite a lot of rules .... It is easier to control more conversative people ba and most of them will not go around making trouble.<br><br>But for CHC, they adopt the conventional approach. They modernise Christianity. All are free to interpret the scripture they want. And many are not so conservative and like those hip hop thing (hip hop no wrong lar...) ..... Oh ya, one more thing. Vision. They like to talk about vision. Vision this vision that. So,well, when people confused vision with just normal day-dreams or whatever thingy .... it can be chaotic lo. Maybe they are too passionate or over passionate?<br><br>So well, which group of people are easier to control?<br><br>The above is just my perceptives. If you think they are wrong. Please correct me with politeness. TY.</div></blockquote>Hi, I do agree with you on the fact that RC are more conservative and are thus easier to control.<br><br>From a strictly personal point of view, I feel that christians, zealous or not, should not misrepresent the faith. Hanging out at bus stops and mrt stations asking random passerbys to attend their services hint at desperation for not meeting their quota.<br><br>Christians should be expected to learn about the faith for a period of time before being baptised. Even the Catholic baptism that may take many years is not foolproof, yet new age christians make do with a baptism process of a few months. In fact, as I have posted before, the baptism class for many new age christian groups does not teach you the fundamentals with the intention for you to know and understand the faith, it is for you to conduct "street witnessing", which means you learn how to hang out at bus stops and mrt stations to convert ppl.<br><br>Hence, many christians are left with a rudimentary understanding fo the christian faith.<br><br>Furthermore, as a religious leader, no matter what religion, a pastor has to uphold certain societial moral standards. Instances of lying (or not correcting others' misinterpretations), misrepresentations, extravagance (however you spell it) and materistic tendancies are all viewed negatively by our society and should not be present in a religious leader.</div>
