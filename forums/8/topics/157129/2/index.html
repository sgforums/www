But of course you are "strongly encouraged" to donate as "the more you donate, the more you are assured of a place in heaven". Therefore, the poor have no place in heaven.<br><br>Also, I heard that donating is not enough, you must meet your monthly quota of new recruits. Amazing isn't it?<br><br>I am Catholic too and despite that, the harvesters still want to recruit me, like they are more concerned with the bottomline than the religion.<br><br>An interesting thing about their conversion process:<br><br>Once they hook their talons into you, they will keep hassling you until you "agree to accept Christ", lo and behold, you are converted. Simple and easy. That's when your nightmare starts.<br><br>You have to start tithing (remember, more money= greater chance of going heaven) and meeting your quota (but the tithe is still more impt, or you can buy horse-face's CD.<br><br>That's also about the same time your lesson in Christianity ends. They do not help you gain a better understanding of Christianity or the scriptures. You're supposed to learn it on your own without guidance, the reason? "You dun need to know how to build a car in order to drive".<br><br>When I queried them about driving lessons, they replied that they do conduct courses for "street wtinessing". What does the course entail? Teaching you how to hang out at bus stops and MRT stations and trying to convert others.<br><br>Interesting bunch if you ask me.</div>

Stayed over at her place to for a night because she had cell group the next day and she wanted me to go. Fair enough, we're good friends. But then, at cell group, (i'm roman catholic btw), i was asked about my church and its practices, because you know catholics adopt the more traditional and old ways of worship. and to my utter disbelief, in front of everyone, she said "Haiya, catholic mass only one hour you all learn what...its crap la. Our church is so much better and reaches out to more people. Catholics are shit la. Join us." Then, to make matters worse, one by one everyone started dissing catholism. I wasn't embarassed though, but rather taken aback as to the kind of discrimination and mentality these guys have. Anyone from CHC can tell me why. Or just anyone. Dammit. I'm so insulted. </div></blockquote>Have faith... my friend.<br><br>To clarify, I'm an athiest now but was an ex-catholic.<br><br>There are alot of ways you can slam them back in talks of the faith, and it sucks that you can wack them in their strongest forte - the bible.<br><br>1) The church which the bible speaks about is the Roman Catholic church.

            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously I have no idea why all the retards go to CHC. My friend's sister is from CHC, and blardy hell when the fridge in the house broke down, she actually KNELT in front of the thing and prayed to God for it to work. WTF. Really lo.<br>My friend told me that the mandatory donations of 10% per month of your income follows one of the commandments of God, or rather one of the TEN commandments of God about giving dunno what siao thing she say...I just think its damn stupid lar.<br>Also, the way she behave, not like christian. They say my angkong mark of the devil, but pierce nose pierce body all not devil markings meh? I can say they deface the body of christ wat. Then they anyhow say God tell them things, try to get me to go to service. Then because I catholic ours is called "mass" (dunno why it matters), my fren so angry i kept saying "mass" instead of "service". Siao. This is christianity in the 21st century. Win alreadi.</div>
