Stayed over at her place to for a night because she had cell group the next day and she wanted me to go. Fair enough, we're good friends. But then, at cell group, (i'm roman catholic btw), i was asked about my church and its practices, because you know catholics adopt the more traditional and old ways of worship. and to my utter disbelief, in front of everyone, she said "Haiya, catholic mass only one hour you all learn what...its crap la. Our church is so much better and reaches out to more people. Catholics are shit la. Join us." Then, to make matters worse, one by one everyone started dissing catholism. I wasn't embarassed though, but rather taken aback as to the kind of discrimination and mentality these guys have. Anyone from CHC can tell me why. Or just anyone. Dammit. I'm so insulted. </div></blockquote>CHC = CRAP<br>CRAP = CHC<br><br>yup..its simple..Dun ever go there again...</div>
