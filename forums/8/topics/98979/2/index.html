SK is right - we are going to pay taxes for income that is not even in our pockets.  The fiscal year for taxing starts in April each year.  Hence, IRAS will give you an estimated income tax you need to pay then.  If it is in excess, they will credit the amount back to you.<br><br>But can you imagine if your income tax run into thousands of dollars?  You would have to fork out that much money!!!  Also, during the implementation year, you would have to pay previous year plus current year taxes!!  That's going to be very taxing (pardon the pun) isn't it?</div></blockquote>the system we r adopting is similar to the US system!!!<br>most likely this part is going to be true!!<br>"during the implementation year, you would have to pay previous year plus current year taxes"<br>but this is not the first time : we had a change of tax system in 1969 oso!!<br>U will be compensated in the future in the form of cessation relief if you have to pay for twice in one yr.<br></div>
