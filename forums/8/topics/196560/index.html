Even though a rainbow spans a continuous spectrum of colours, traditionally the full sequence of colours is most commonly cited as red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. It is commonly thought that indigo was included due to the different religious connotations of the numbers six and seven at the time of Isaac Newton's work on light, despite its lack of scientific significance and the poor ability of humans to distinguish colours in the blue portion of the visual spectrum. -<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow</a><br><br>At night only got MOON, no sun.

The Moon's diameter is 3,476 kilometres (2,160 mi). <strong>Reflected sunlight from the Moon's surface reaches Earth in 1.3 seconds (at the speed of light).</strong><br><br>The first man-made object to land on the Moon was Luna 2 in 1959, the first photographs of the otherwise occluded far side of the Moon were made by Luna 3 in the same year, and the first people to land on the Moon came aboard Apollo 11 in 1969.<br><br><strong>well..my bad about the no water part..just found out..there is water... here..</strong><br><br>Presence of water<br><br>Over time, comets and meteoroids continuously bombard the Moon. Many of these objects are water-rich. Energy from sunlight splits much of this water into its constituent elements hydrogen and oxygen, both of which usually fly off into space immediately. However, it has been hypothesized that significant traces of water remain on the Moon, either on the surface, or embedded within the crust. The results of the Clementine mission suggested that small, frozen pockets of water ice (remnants of water-rich comet impacts) may be embedded unmelted in the permanently shadowed regions of the lunar crust. Although the pockets are thought to be small, the overall amount of water was suggested to be quite significant Â— 1 kmÂ³.<br><br>Some water molecules, however, may have literally hopped along the surface and become trapped inside craters at the lunar poles. Due to the very slight "tilt" of the Moon's axis, only 1.5Â°, some of these deep craters never receive any light from the Sun Â— they are permanently shadowed. Clementine has mapped[9] craters at the lunar south pole[10] which are shadowed in this way. It is in such craters that scientists expect to find frozen water if it is there at all. If found, water ice could be mined and then split into hydrogen and oxygen by solar panel-equipped electric power stations or a nuclear generator. The presence of usable quantities of water on the Moon would be an important factor in rendering lunar habitation cost-effective, since transporting water (or hydrogen and oxygen) from Earth would be prohibitively expensive.<br><br></div>
