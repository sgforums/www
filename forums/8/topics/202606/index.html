            <div class='col-md body'>Copyright Act<br><br>and<br><br>IPOS<br><br>INFRINGEMENT<br><br>Infringement occurs when one does something that only the copyright owner has<br>the exclusive rights to do, without his consent, or when one commercially deals with infringing goods. Examples would be if one photocopies an article without the consent of the copyright owner or if one knowingly sells infringing goods.<br><br>It is important to note that one does not need to have reproduced the entire copyright<br>work before infringement takes place. It is an infringement as long as a substantial amount of the original work, quality-wise, has been copied.<br><br>REMEDIES<br><br>Remedies are the measures of relief that the Court can grant to a person whose rights are infringed. In civil lawsuits, remedies for copyright owners include injunctions (to stop someone from doing something), damages (whether actual damages, as proved, or statutory damages), and account of profits. Where it is proper to do so, considering the flagrancy of the infringement, the Court may also order additional damages to be paid by the infringing party to the copyright owner.<br><br>An award of statutory damages is a remedy that the Court may order against the infringing party without the need for the copyright owner to prove the loss he has suffered as a result of the infringement. This is subject to a per-work ceiling of $10 000 and to an aggregate ceiling of $200,000/- for the particular action.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>CRIMINAL OFFENCE<br><br>In Singapore, criminal offences under copyright law include the following:<br><br>Â• making of infringing copies for sale;<br>Â• sale of infringing copies;<br>Â• possession or import of infringing copies for the purposes of sale or of distribution for the purpose of trade;<br>Â• distribution of infringing copies for the purposes of trade.<br><br>In any of the instances above, it must be proved that the infringing party knows or<br>ought reasonably to know that the copies were infringing copies.<br><br>Further, it is also a criminal offence if a person wilfully infringes copyright either to a significant extent or for the purpose of obtaining a commercial advantage.<br><br>Criminal Liability for Wilful Infringement<br><br>It is also a criminal offence if a person wilfully infringes copyright either for the purpose of obtaining a commercial advantage or to a significant extent.<br><br>Commercial advantage means any direct advantage, benefit or financial gain for a business or trade. As to whether the infringement is to a significant extent, this is judged based on the volume, value of infringing copies and whether the infringement has a substantial prejudicial impact on the copyright owner and all other relevant matters.<br><br>The penalties for such wilful copyright infringement are:<br><br>* 1st offence, a fine not exceeding $20,000 and/or imprisonment up to 6 months;<br>* 2nd or subsequent offence, a fine not exceeding $50,000 and/or imprisonment up to 3 years.<br><br>Other acts that have civil and criminal liabilities include:<br><br>* circumventing a technological measure (page 10); and<br>* falsely removing or altering the rights management information electronically attached to a work (page 11).</div>
