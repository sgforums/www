            <div class='col-md body'>Whatever the case, I do not believe the Press should have a free pass to publish pictures without prior authorisation.<br><br>Using that Act as a form of defence, which is very much open-ended, is not the way to go.If you bother to write an article, better go and get your sources' permission. This is not about photography in a public place, but rather about republication of media already granted ad nauseum copyright under Singapore law.<br><br>Furthermore, that section of the Copyright Act says that "sufficient acknowledgement" is required. Meaning, a simple caption or a disclaimer for review usage should have been published.<br><br>I have first-hand knowledge of certain happenings in the past with relation to unauthorised usage of images, but I will not reveal it publicly. Just to highlight that in every organisation, there are bad apples, and it is the organisation's responsibility to weed them out.<br><br>If they even want to condone such behaviour, then it really says a lot about their supposed "world-class" standards doesn't it?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
