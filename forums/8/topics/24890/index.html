            <div class='col-md body'>Top 10 Cat vs. Dog Characteristics<br><br>10. Dogs come when you call them. Cats take a message and get back to you.<br><br>9. Dogs will let you give them a bath without taking out a contract on your life.<br><br>8. Dogs will bark to wake you up if the house is on fire. Cats will quietly sneak out the back door.<br><br>7. Dogs will bring you your slippers or the evening newspaper. Cats might bring you a dead mouse.<br><br>6. Dogs will play Frisbee with you all afternoon. Cats will take a three-hour nap.<br><br>5. Dogs will sit on the car seat next to you. Cats have to have their own private box or they will not go at all.<br><br>4. Dogs will greet you and lick your face when you come home from work. Cats will be mad that you went to work at all.<br>3. Dogs will sit, lie down, and heel on command. Cats will smirk and walk away.<br><br>2. Dogs will tilt their heads and listen whenever you talk. Cats will yawn and close their eyes.<br><br>1. Dogs will give you unconditional love forever. Cats will make you pay for every mistake you've ever made since the day you were born.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>God created a new animal to be a companion for Adam. And it was a good animal. And God was pleased. And the new animal was pleased to be with Adam, and he wagged his tail. And Adam said, But Lord, I have already named all the animals in the kingdom, and all the good names are taken.<br><br>And God said, No problem! Because I have created this new animal to be a reflection of my love for you, his name will be a reflection of my own name, and you will call him DOG. And Dog lived with Adam and was a companion to him and loved him. And Adam was comforted. And God was pleased. And Dog was content and wagged his tail.<br><br>After a while, it came to pass that AdamÂ’s guardian angel came to the Lord and said, Lord, Adam has become filled with pride. He struts and preens like a peacock, and he believes he is worthy of adoration. Dog has indeed taught him that he is loved, but no one has taught him humility.<br><br>And God said, No problem! I will create for him a companion who will be with him forever and who will see him as he is. The companion will remind him of his limitations, so he will know that he is not worthy of adoration. And God created CAT to be a companion to Adam. And Cat would not obey Adam.<br><br>And when Adam gazed into CatÂ’s eyes, he was reminded that he was not the supreme being. And Adam learned humility. God was pleased. Adam became greatly improved. And Cat did not care one way or the other.</div>
