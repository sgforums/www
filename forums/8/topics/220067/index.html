            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Have you ever wondered whether your face has an influence on your life choices?<br><br>After research, I am more convinced now that our face will determine what kind of person we will be.<br><br>Here in the first of this series, I will present to you some examples, and it's up to you to draw your conclusions.<br><br>Since ancient time our ancestors were already able to see relationship between face and personality. I believe there is natural order in this world, and we are continuing this trend.<br><br>Now in this first series, I will show you the facial examples of.....adventurers.<br><br>Adventurers are people who climb mountains, go to North Pole, those sort of things. As you can imagine, they must be really determined people with strong will and perserverance and can withstand difficulties and hardship.<br><br>This is totally an idea which came to me coincidentally when I saw a photo of an adventurer which look very much like Singapore adventurer Khoo Swee Chiow, but not him.<br><br>From there I was convinced there must be some relationship between face and choice/ personality. Because I find Khoo Swee Chiow face very special.<br><br>Ok enough talk, now on to the cheese:<br><br>Here I will post photos from Google Images of a few adventureres, together with their names:<br><br>Khoo Swee Chiow<br><img src="http://images.google.com/images?q=tbn:WHTp50f69CYBTM:http://www.cdnn.info/news/industry/khoo_swee_chiow_250333.jpg"><br><br>Peter Hillary<br><img src="http://images.google.com/images?q=tbn:-7jbIDxgcWJumM:http://media.premierespeakers.com/speakers/web/3379_web.jpg"><br><br>Peter Hillary close-up<br><img src="http://images.google.com/images?q=tbn:a_ctmWHV70LL-M:http://www.speakersla.com/2006-07/images/hillary-large.jpg"><br><br>Ann Bancroft<br><img src="http://images.google.com/images?q=tbn:NnTzVn7nmp8iWM:http://www.keynotespeakers.com/doc/photos/3214_photo_126200412922PM_Bancroft_Annnewweb.jpg"><br><br>Ruth Wilson<br><img src="http://images.google.com/images?q=tbn:8e9uIpx8MccxdM:http://www.ruthwilson.net/introduction_12.jpg"><br><br>Pasang Lhamu Sherpa<br><img src="http://images.google.com/images?q=tbn:1n69KrF9rBB1OM:http://www.sawnet.org/whoswho/images/Jayasinghe_bronze.jpg"><br><br>Emily Kimball<br><img src="http://images.google.com/images?q=tbn:Y-NMF9pwA1712M:http://www.aeispeakers.com/images/headshots/Kimball-Emily.jpg"><br><br>Fogar Ambrogrio<br><img src="http://images.google.com/images?q=tbn:qnzv0_GY0LlnjM:http://www.lifeinlegacy.com/2005/Sep/FogarAmbrogio.jpg"><br><br>Fogar Ambrogrio 2<br><img src="http://images.google.com/images?q=tbn:K1WXEttWVhUyBM:http://www.jonas.it/foto/art_207_1_Fogar.jpg"><br><br>Steve Fossett<br><img src="http://news.bbc.co.uk/media/images/40875000/jpg/_40875049_flyer_2_203.jpg"><br><br>Steve Fossett2<br><img src="http://images.google.com/images?q=tbn:jWL97ZzDl0F4DM:http://ussailing.com/pressreleases/images/STEVE%2520FOSSETT4.jpg"><br><br>Ed Hommer<br><img src="http://images.google.com/images?q=tbn:v3b-c7oHyJswmM:http://www.everestquest.com/images/ed_big.jpg"><br><br>.<br><br>So.

            <div class='col-md body'>They all have a certain kind of looks.<br><br>I tried to include women and different races just for illustration purpose that it's a type of look which is the factor.<br><br>Since thousands of years ago, ancient people have written their observations about our world, including people's looks. Ancient Egyptians made pyramid calculations and mathematic formulas which still stand today. Ancient Chinese with SunTzu made war treatise which is still tought in modern military academies today. Unfortunately I think face reading is abit overlooked and not getting much development in our era.<br><br>This is an example of ancient face reading.<br><br><img src="http://images.google.com/images?q=tbn:hoamNQGZMF0SdM:http://www.classic-feng-shui.com/image-files/face-reading1.jpg"><br><br>Ok, anyway Im trying to make my own observation, contemporary observation in our era. But it is not special because many before us have done the same.<br><br>Ok, Now I will move on to the next category of people, computer geeks.<br><br>Why computer geeks, because I think it's interesting and enable us to think deeper whether it's nature or nurture which make us who we are. I choose computer geeks because I find it perfect for the chicken-egg question. Do you have geeky face because you sit too long in front of computer, or do you sit too long because you have geeky face and dont like to go out?<br><br>Ok, characteristic of computer geeks are technical people, people who spent alot of time in technical stuff, who are interested to think about logic, systems and things like that.<br><br>Bill Gates, Microsoft.<br><br><img src="http://images.google.com/images?q=tbn:rRwazl-rwGcrHM:http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9810/13/gates.idg/bill.gates.jpg"><br><br>Jerry Yang, Yahoo.<br><img src="http://images.google.com/images?q=tbn:1dlCNgA-P4irWM:http://media.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/photo/2005/09/10/PH2005091001223.jpg"><br><br>Two examples enough already.

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Here I think if facial science can be developed further in our era, it can enable us to tap further into this resource, for a variety of purpose and benefits.<br><br>For instance,<br><br>Let's say for company HR recruitment.<br><br>You know some companies try to assess candidates through IQ test or personality test, correct? Also some will make you write essays and then conduct interviews to see your body language and personality. However I dont recall any companies try to do facial analysis from photos for example. This is an area which is overlooked and can be developed further. This can be used for a variety of organizations, for instance military, or government, or charities, whatever organization, not just companies.<br><br>Another example,<br><br>Dating service/ match making service.<br><br>Business negotiation.<br><br>And so on.<br><br>But I think it can also be used at the individual level for a deeper purpose, to empower us to know who we are and how we can get to know ourselves better, and also how to change ourselves.<br><br>What I mean is this:<br><br>As you can see from the above series of photos, you can do the same to yourself. Stand in front of a mirror. What do you see? Who are you?<br><br>By standing in front of a mirror, you can get a lot of insight into who you are and what kind of personality you have. There is no denying that it's a great tool.<br><br>I think also you can change the way you look, or your personality, by changing either one of them. They are two sides of a coin.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh its scientifically proven or something... you can tell a person character by looking at the face. Like example if you have a wide forehead, it means you have cleverness and a practical nature. If you have a high rounded forehead depicts idealism with a strong focus on friendship. But if your forehead is like super super wide, that means you are someoen ho loves to daydream and must focus your energies to be successful.<br><br>Then if you have deep set eyes that means you are super possessive but if you have dreamy eyes, it means you are passionate and sometimes complacent.<br><br>If you ears are big that means you are smart or you are a risktaker<br><br>I read online before. You can go read up on books to find out. I think kinokunya have soem books about telling a person character from his face!<br><br>Now we can judge a book by its cover. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I think its quite accurate lah<br></div>
