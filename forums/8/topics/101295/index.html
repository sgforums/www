            <div class='col-md body'>i held high regards for teachers.. but sadly this society seems to take teacher for granted... the parents blame the teachers for helping them educate their misbehaving child, the students in the class are always looking for opportunity to get a glimps of teacher zao geng... sad ...<br><br>i guess if you are to choose teaching as a career, you must be prepared for the worst and understand that the only motivation you are gonna get is seeing ur students all passing with good grades and u have made a difference in their lives.. there would seldom be words of encouragment from anyone.. you yourself will be the one motivating you to go on.<br><br>as for prospect.. see lor.. work for 10 years maybe senior teacher.. 20 years hod.. 30 VP.. 40 principal.. if not shiok then come out find jobs lor.. if you are having a degree, a diploma in education can only add to ur advantage.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is from the Straits Times Forum... i think the article is pretty accurate. when u try to take sick leave cuz ur v sick, ur accused of not having the right professional attitude. makes u wonder what sick leave benefits are for?<br><br>Nov 4, 2004<br>Don't let teachers suffer in silence<br><br>I MET UP with several of my old friends who are in the teaching service recently. Inevitably, the subject of teaching cropped up in our conversations.<br><br>The experience of most of them is, however, far from that portrayed in the recruitment advertisements. The main grievance is not with the nature of the profession. All of them expressed great satisfaction in being able to improve the grades and lives of their students in their own way.<br><br>From my anecdotal findings, the chief cause of contention is that of the management of the schools. The common complaints are:<br><br>Long working hours. Most teachers spend more than 12 hours on the job every day during term time, arriving in school before sunrise and leaving after dark.<br><br>Not only do they have to hold remedial classes - until about 2.30pm - but they also have to clear a barrage of administrative and 'special' projects imposed by their heads of department or principal.<br><br>The day, however, does not end after they get home as, with no time to mark scripts in school, they have to bring them back as homework. They would probably have to sit under the table lamp with the pile of papers till 11.30pm or later. I know of teachers who have only two to three hours of sleep each day for the entire week.<br><br>While many of my friends seem to be able to cope with the emotional strain of managing their students (as well as their parents), they appear to be significantly more pressured by their superiors in school. In most cases, the management of their schools is unreasonable in its demands and unsympathetic to their needs and welfare.<br><br>Teachers are unable to spend more time with their students or are just barely clearing their workload as they have to attend courses and workshops mandated by the Ministry of Education (MOE) which they found at times to be irrelevant and frivolous.<br><br>While these may be common grouses in all industries and professions, the situation seems to be endemic in the teaching profession. From what I heard, there are apparently few meaningful avenues for teachers to seek help and redress at a higher and more impartial level without facing repercussions.<br><br>They therefore feel that they are in a situation where when their principals or heads of department say 'jump!', they have to say 'how high?'. Hence quitting has become one option for many. While figures are not publicly available, I am sure that the turnover is relatively high.<br><br>The once-noble profession of teaching has been undermined by mismanagement. One teacher said: 'In the past, we were like gods. Now we are like dogs.'<br><br>From the concerns about the broad changes to the education system down to even the details of a PSLE science exam, it seems to me and many teachers that more attention is being paid to the student. In the process, we have left the teacher out of the equation.<br><br>While I am not in the teaching profession, I feel the need to bring into the open the difficulties faced by teachers in carrying out their duties. While parents and students have their own prerogatives, I urge them to show more respect and understanding to teachers.<br><br>The same goes for school managements which should see their staff as human beings to be nurtured, instead of machines to be exploited.<br><br>For the MOE, I think it is necessary to provide a more sensitive bureaucratic system that allows the needs and problems of the teachers to be carefully addressed.<br><br>Teachers should not be treated as gods or dogs. Neither should we leave them to suffer in silence, for their problems would inevitably become those of the school and society as well.<br><br>Liew Kai Khiun<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>from the straits times forum 11 nov 2004<br><br><strong>Teachers are not sacrificial lambs being fleeced </strong><br>I READ with interest the letter, 'Don't let teachers suffer in silence' (ST, Nov 4). In it, Mr Liew Kai Khiun highlighted the plight of teachers being 'exploited like machines' as 'most spend more than 12 hours on the job every day' and have 'two or three hours of sleep each day'.<br><br>Mr Liew speaks from an outsider's point of view and his assertions, though not entirely groundless, cannot be taken to represent the profession as a whole.<br><br>His letter alludes to the dehumanised, disenfranchised and marginalised states of teachers and demonises school leaders.<br><br>Mr Liew seems to portray teachers as sacrificial lambs helplessly being fleeced by tyrannical managements. Yet most of the 26,000 or so teachers hold at least a degree and are individuals with thinking faculties and decision-making abilities. It is rather unfair of Mr Liew to make sweeping accusations after hearing the stories of a few, albeit people with valid concerns.<br><br>The teaching profession does have programmes aimed at taking care of the welfare of teachers and various avenues have been made available to them to voice their concerns.<br><br>Yet it is more important to note that a teacher can take responsibility for and control over his own career through self-empowerment. This can translate into:<br><br>Being aware of what one's rights are and not suffering in silence. Only the individual who is bold in articulating his concerns, despite limitations and repercussions, can make positive changes.<br><br>Having a mastery of both inner and physical resources to change less-than-ideal outcomes. Develop soft skills like persuasion, and network with people who might be able to provide the platforms to effect change. And have a support group to offer mental and emotional support.<br><br>Reflecting on past mistakes and archaic methods to explore possible win-win solutions. A teacher might actually work less to accomplish more through collaboration.<br><br>For remedial classes, he could group weak pupils from various classes together and work with his colleagues in taking turns each week to help the pupils.<br><br>Learning to prioritise. Have an overview of events on the calendar and plan ahead. Take care of core businesses related to the needs of students first. Never-ending work needs to be checked by a mind that is keenly aware that there are only 24 hours a day.<br><br>Not allowing one's past to limit or paralyse one's present or future. We are shaped not by our experiences, but by our interpretations of them.<br><br>Look at the half-full glass and work at filling it. Better still, tip the glass and start afresh.<br><br>Model after people who have succeeded in balancing teaching and living.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Lena Soh Kwee Kim (Ms) </span></strong><br><br><strong>An increasingly demanding job </strong><br><br>I HAVE a number of secondary-school teachers among my family and friends. Often they talk about how teaching has become increasingly stressful over the years. Their experiences appear to support some of the views of Mr Liew Kai Khiun.<br><br>Working hours for teachers get longer towards the end of the term as their marking load increases. While secondary-school teachers may sometimes leave school as early as 2pm, they often take home their students' homework. According to them, most of the time in school is spent teaching, attending meetings, and answering e-mail.<br><br>Many teachers have weekend CCA duties while mandatory school events, such as parent-teacher gatherings, training courses and workshops, and certain staff meetings often fall on Saturday mornings or afternoons.<br><br>Many teachers return to school during the school holidays, working on projects and looking after their CCAs. They are seldom free during the June and December holidays, except for one to two weeks.<br><br>With increasing reliance on IT, more teachers, especially the young ones, are communicating with their students, giving advice and even conducting lessons online after school hours, from their home PCs.<br><br>According to them, besides attending numerous staff meetings, writing reports, calculating and analysing exam statistics, organising school events and programmes, teachers are also encouraged to come up with new programmes and initiatives to enrich learning for the students.<br><br>In the race to be more 'value-added', to be more innovative and enterprising, and to be top in the school rankings, teachers have half-willingly added to the load on themselves.<br><br>From what I hear, bureaucratic management and accountability systems have given teachers and administrators a lot of tedious paperwork. These evaluation measures add to the pressures faced by schools in an age of competition for continuous improvement.<br><br>The teachers I know find the greatest satisfaction in their interactions with students, and in their intellectual passions. While the system must be accountable for measurable standards of excellence in education, it should not take away time for teachers to be creative, to build caring relationships with students, and to pursue their own independent learning.<br><br>It seems that teachers need more time and support from schools and the Ministry of Education in order to keep pace with the increasing demands placed on them. For now, it remains to be seen how far the ministry's recent policies, such as the five-day work week and the recruitment of more teachers and administrators, will help to lessen the stresses of the profession.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Brendon Liew Cheng Kit </span></strong><br><br><strong>Teachers I know are happy and satisfied </strong><br><br>I WOULD like to offer an account of what I have heard from my relatives and friends who are teachers. They are:<br><br>Happy with the working hours - weekdays from morning to afternoon, leaving them plenty of time with their families. Some even have time to take up part-time work like giving tuition. They also get paid school hols.<br><br>Satisfied with the pay and job security.<br><br>Well-respected by students and their parents. None of the teachers I know complained about rude students or unreasonable parents.<br><br>They understand that students today are more outspoken but that is not to say they are rude; more parents today contact teachers to keep tabs on their children's school activities but that is not to say they are demanding.<br><br>Well-managed by department heads and principals who are sensitive to their well-being. There are targets to be met but this is done in consultation with them. Principals relieve teachers of administrative work by getting clerks and parent volunteers to help.<br><br>If teachers have any complaints about their superiors or management of schools, they should not suffer in silence but bring them up with the Ministry of Education.<br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong><br>Lim Juat Lian (Mdm) </strong></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well to those who belittle the teaching profession, try being a relief teacher for a week in a neighbourhood school. believe me, u will will appreciate the teaching profession more. by the way, pls take note that a relief teacher can leave when the sch bells rings at 2pm, no meetings, no CCAs, no remedials.<br><br>At times, i really wonder if teachers should be known as teachers.....they do practically everything.<br>Teachers are bao kah liao........have to teach, be a disciplinarian, a counsellor to the students, conduct CCAs and enrichment classes, answer stupid phone calls from parents asking where the hell are their kids, committe/department meetings, piles of admin work to do, coordinate adhoc event  like speech day, sports day, carnival, musicals, competitions.....etc.<br><br>There is definitely something very wrong with the system.  Why do young teachers want to quit after their bond ends?? Many don't mind getting a pay cut and have a less stressful job. Some who did a career switch to teaching regretted it.<br><br>Well, the govt think they are making jobs easier by coming up with the five day week....nah, it is merely pushing CCAs that were used to be conducted on Saturdays to the weekdays. Worse...everything is so damn packed now that they have to bring work home to mark.<br><br>The only satisfaction i guess is to see the students graduate with good grades and character.</div>
