            <div class='col-md body'>erh.........i don not think that housing benefits still exists in the civil service.  I think that was in the past.<br><br>People not in the teaching service may hear many different stories from their teacher-friends, some saying that tachers have a good life while others are drowning in work.<br><br>As a teacher myself, i just want to say that the teaching service is large with twenty-over thousand teachers.  I believe that the working environment fro primary and secondary teachers are very different with different areas of stress.  Also, just like everywhere else, your job pressure would also depends on the type of bosses and fellow workers.  Or even your customer, in the teaching service the type of students and parents.<br><br>Of course, responses differ with the age of the teachers. From my personal experience, quite a few old(not senior) teachers actullay pity the young teachers and one of them told me that frankly the best days of teaching are long over for him.  For older teachers like him, life now is very different and more difficult.  However, younger teachers like me came inside the present system straight away and could possibly adapt better.  So opinons differ from people to people.<br><br>Sorry for the long post, maybe this teacher is another whiner.</div>
