Apparently this boy had fell asleep with some sweets in his mouth or with some sweet stuff beside him. Ants soon got to him and some ants in fact crawled into his ear which somehow managed to go to his brain.<br>When he woke up, he did not realize that ants had gone to his head. After that, he constantly complains about itchiness around his face. His mother brought him to see a doctor but the doctor could not figure out what was wrong with him. He took an X-ray of the boy and to his horror, he found a group of live ants in his skull.<br>Since the ants are still alive, the doctor could not operate on him cuz the ants are constantly moving about. The boy at last died. So please be careful when leaving foodstuff beside your bed or when eating in bed. This might attract ants. Most importantly, NEVER eat a sweet before going to bed. You might fall asleep and suffer same fate as the little boy.<br><br>Incident 2:<br><br>Another similar incident happened in the hospital in Taiwan. This man was warded in the hospital and was constantly warned by the nurses not to leave food stuff by his bedside for there are ants about. He did not heed their advice. Ants finally got to him. His family members said that the man constantly complain about headaches. He died and a post mortem or autopsy was done on him.<br>Doctors found a group of live ants in his head. Apparently, the ants had been eating bits of his brain. Ughhhhhhh!!! So dear friends, better be safe than sorry!! Never leave foodstuff beside you when you go to sleep!!!!!<br><br>Doesnt seem like a joke to mee... I betta warn my brother......<br><br>&gt;______&lt;</div></blockquote>oh my god!! how horrible ants are..</div>
