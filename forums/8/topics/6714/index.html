            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I have been branded the king buaya of the forum... a title which fits none the better. Recently, I have been having thoughts... thoughts if I can really fall in love with someone, And not just another flirting session. And how would I myself know? sometimes, I am not so sure myself, if I am ready to commit, ready to really fall in love with someone. Is it a crime to flirt around? And is the punishment of such behaviour, loneliness? I am wondering if I can really commit, and even if I can, how will I know? And even if I know, will she accept and aknowledge my feelings? Will she not feel insecure? I am sure she will, how will she know that she is not just another passer by in my life? Or shall I even say, a by watcher? Is there a possibility at all that I can even fall in love even if I want to? I guess not, I will be too hard a person to accepted by her. Such is my punishment.<br><br>------------------<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Just my $0.02 + $0.03(from Lex) worth</span></strong></div>

As to if I have found that someone, like in my soul-searching, I do not know myself. How could I know, when I am not even sure? *smiles* Well, maybe it is another emotional roller-coaster I am going through, maybe I am just posting to let off some steam. I do not really know. *smiles* But thanks, anyway, like I said, it is heart warming to know that someone still cares for a rotten person like me.<br><br>------------------<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Just my $0.02 + $0.03(from Lex) worth</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Callan:<br><br>I think buayas goes around doing what they do because they always take a fancy to something new, and their attention fades quickly. Perhaps once someone takes your fancy and the feeling stays, then you have found what you unconciously wanted.<br><br>As to how you know, I can't answer that. Maybe here is no objective measurement after all. Like they say, if you don't know, think harder.<br><br>Flirting around is not wrong. It just has some drawbacks, namely, you might not be taken seriously at a first glance. It might also promote insecurity.  But like you said many times, in a relationship there is the later stage. Thats where both of you do the hard work and you do the convincing. No, I said convincing, not bullshitting Callan.<br><br>No idea what you have been through Callan. Perhaps a bout of life threatening disease ?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>In any case, don't stop buayaing your loved one if you have found her.

            <div class='col-md body'>Callan, you will know it when you truly fall in love. When 2 person fall in love with each other, there may be doubts as first but sooner or later you will realise that all external factors do not matter. In time, you might change your behavior as well. The girl would accept you for the way you are if she truly loves you. Callan, nothing is impossible. Do not presume that a buaya cannot fall in love and commit to a relationship. Our thinking changes as time goes on and various events unfold.<br>To flirt around is not a crime. Nor is there any punishment for such actions. Its just the nature of your personality. There is nothing wrong with that. To some other people, its can even be considered as a talent. Not everyone can buaya until so effectively like you u know?<br>The fact that you are engaging in self-reflection now could be a sign that you might be willing to "settle down"? Or are you truly feeling tired of all the buayaing?<br>These are the questions you have to ask yourself.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Are you scaring someone and you wonder if she's _the_one_ and you're driving her away and you wonder now whether you should change to keep her close?<br><br>Callan, flirting is easy to pick up, harder to drop.  If you stop flirting now and you decide to restart again in a couple of months, it's very easy.  There are always girls around, right?  If you're unsure about your feeling towards this girl, then stop flirting, see what happens, if you miss it so much you can't appreciate her being around anymore then let her go and come back to your dears and darlings.<br><br>As for dropping flirting, hmm, okay, it's tough once you get too used to it.  But you're a man of determination.  The other reason to consider stop flirting is the feeling of loneliness that just won't go.  Tell me if flirting's not the cure, why bother?  In the risk of sounding cheesy again, I don't think flirters should run around so much chasing butterflies until we forget to smell and see the roses.  Only supportive, true, close friends can keep us rooted and I think everyone should have some of them.  We then can go about chasing butterflies again but when the loneliness strikes, we will come back to the bosoms of our friends and remember that we are not alone.<br><br>I sound like psychopop peddler.  Oh well, try to read deeper meanings into it, will you?  I sincerely believe the values that lie behind the silly roses analogy and I sincerely hope you'll feel better.<br><br>------------------<br>"Time flies like an arrow.
