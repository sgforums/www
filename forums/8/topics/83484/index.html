            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, I am really surprised when the bombing of the train station in Madrid, Spain, that the Spanish govt actually pulled out all of its troops in Iraq and that the Spanish people agreed to it. Whats more surprising is that since that method is so effective, the terrorists are'nt bombing more countries that way since it deemed so effective on the Spanish Govt and people.<br><br>With the recent news of the beheading of the Korean in Iraq, I'm even more surprised that the Korean(known for being good fighters) people do not want to capture the killers but still want to pull out of Iraq as well...<br><br>I do condemn the war in Iraq(would rather see the US pull out, but would it solve the problem???) but if the US were to pull out of Iraq, Iraq will turn into the HQ of Terrorists and become another Nazi Germany. This would be the start of another world war as Syria would join Iraq, followed by Afghanistan and other radical muslim countries(which by the way, there are at least 5 more). Can we avoid another world war???<br><br>If the terrorists had their own way, they will build a bigger army, get mass weapons of destruction and try to kill even more people. Their ulitmate aim is to destroy USA, to do so, they need to start a world war. Their satisfaction for killings and deaths will never be satisfied until they killed every american.<br><br>If all the countries and its citizens like Korea and Spain were to cower in fear and submit to the terrorists demands and wants, we will face even more trouble as the terrorists grow bigger in power and numbers. Then, I'm afraid we are just digging ourselves into a grave of our own.<br><br>Please stand up against Terrorists and not back down and let them trample over us!</div>

They did, they did'nt want anything to do with the war in Iraq.<br><br>So what I'm saying is that method is effective. Just keep bombing more cities, as more countries back out their support, the terrorists will grow stronger and stronger. Before you know it, they will get their hands on nuclear weapons and since they are experts at bombing every city in the world, they will just need 1 Nuke for each city that they hate, which seems to be everyone. Look, when will the terrorist stop the killing? Will they ever stop killing? There's no end, if people and nations do not realize this, they're all in trouble.<br><br></div>

So yes if you're sick of reading all this assumptuous crap, please read carefully and understand that both examples relate to Iraq and terrorists there! Where's the assumptuous crap?<br><br></div>
