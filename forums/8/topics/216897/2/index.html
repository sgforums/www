When he returned to the room, she was bleeding from the mouth. Seeing this, he panicked and strangled her to death with his bare hands, then undressed her to give the impression of a rape. After this, he wrapped her body in nine layers of plastic bags, stuffed her into a cardboard box sealed with adhesive tape, and left the box in the storeroom.</div>
