Since you didn't know, there are couples who survive the test of army and the relationships that do survive this period usually come out stronger than they were before.<br><br>You have heard from your friends how the girl initiates break-up while the guy is in army. Well, you should spare a thought for the girl in each case. It's never easy being left alone emotionally and where the guy is always not there for you.

Love is not as beautiful as u tot. </div></blockquote>It is harder to find true love these days because people themselves don't hope. It's a vicous cycle. More people fail to believe in love, more relationships don't work out, which leads to more people not believing and trying for love, which again leads to more relationships not working out.<br><br>Besides, why think so much about the negative? True love isn't just about being together forever. It's also about the two of you giving the most you can for the relationship and not having any regrets. Sometimes when you truly love someone, you will not want to hold them back.<br><br>What is love anyway? What is your definition of love?</div>

People so happily in love just let them be. No point spreading misery around, won't help you in anyway. Let them have their happy moments now so that they'll have some happy memories in their lives, whether or not they stay together.<br><br>People usually don't regret loving a person, rather, people regret not ever having had a person to love.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">But there are also cases wher the gal breaks cause she meets another farker in sch who can drives her ard, hav more time to sweet talk her..<br>Though she may say some rely noble, forgivable reasons, the true underlyin reason cld be plain superficial.<br>Its like she will surely say "we are not compatible in terms of character, personality, interest etc " instead of " i am leavin cause u can't be there when i am feelin horny &amp; nd a gd F**, u understd stupid botak! " </div></blockquote>Actually, what you're saying adds on to my point. So why hold the girl back if she can be happier with someone else? No point being so selfish then everybody feel miserable. Afterall, the other guy can be there for her and can provide for her. In some sense, it's probably good that the girl has someone to look after her and to care for her. So I won't say the reason is superficial. She needs emotional support afterall.<br><br>The girl won't consider another relationship if she's happy with the current one. For her to allow someone else into her life means something is already wrong.<br><br>Besides, the situation you mention doesn't happen with ALL breakups. And whether or not another person is involved, the main point is whether the girl is still happy in the relationship or not.<br><br>The girl may not say the true reason for the breakup also because she feels it's less painful for the guy that way. To give a reason that she feels is easier for the guy to accept. Breaking up is painful none-the-less, and not just for the guy.<br><br>Think in terms of the overall picture, not just one person's point of view.</div>
