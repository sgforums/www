            <div class='col-md body'>There is this young little teenage (20++) in Mohammad Sultan Road who ask for monies from practically anyone.<br><br>He begs for monies, 10 cents, 20 cents or $1-2 dollars for drinks or food at night. And in the morning, again he asked at the coffeeshop for breakfast. Once I saw him finishing the leftovers from earlier customers.<br><br>He can walk, run, talk, he may be slightly mentally unstable for at times he dance to some tunes.<br><br>He never seems to shower or wash his clothes.  A truly 'ji gong' in MOhammad Sultan.<br><br>It's simply puzzling how he could end up in such bad state.<br><br>Hope some social workers may get in touch with him and render some assistance to him.<br><br></div>

Unless your intelligence is still stuck at infant stage, I would suggest you to get some education.<br><br>And that explains alot why you're always alone in reality...cos you're going to die alone anyway.

            <div class='col-md body'>That is why I always have this mindset that in Singapore it is a good place to earn a living but NEVER a good place for retirement cuz you still can see so many old people doing cleaner, wash dishes etc menial task for that few miserly dollars. Aren't such group of ppl supposed to retire and be happy during their dying years?<br><br>For me I dun think I wanna be in the same situation as them when I grow too old to be able to contribute to spore economy. I must plan for my retirement now. Hope most of you do too <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
