              <p>What's with all this fuss about men being gentlemenly all of a sudden?</p>
              <p>Quite a few men that I know would hold the door open not only for ladies, but even for other chaps. They'd give up their seats for pregnant women, oldfolk, tired-looking women. They seem quite gracious to me.</p>
              <p>Ever seen the movie "A Few Good Men"?</p>
              <p>It's true about good men. There's just a few.</p>
              <p>Though, IMHO, i feel that the same applies for women too.</p>
              <p>I've met my share of "bad guys" too, but again, why this fixation on guys?</p>
              <p>What about the womenfolk?</p>
              <p>Talk about equal rights. When men do it, its wrong, but when women do it, it's okay?</p>
              <p>Only guys should open doors for girls. Only guys should give up the seats for needy people. Only guys should go to NS.</p>
              <p>Guys should suffer, cos they're guys, issit?</p>
              <p>Wow.</p>
              <p>No wonder quite a few guys give up.</p>
              <p>Being guys that is.</p>
              <p>Why don't people complain when it's a <em>girl</em> that doesn't give up her courtesy seat for an old lady. Why doesn't <em>she</em> get dirty stares?</p>
              <p>Kind of puts stuff into different perspective.</p>
              <p>I'm not trying to be condenscending here.</p>
              <p>Just trying to give a different view, different take on this.</p>
              <p>One reason why it's hard to be a guy in SG is this:</p>
              <p>We want to live up to western ideals, but at the same time, keep our asian values at heart.</p>
              <p>Sometimes this is viable. Other times... Not really. Actually, it's very conflicting.</p>
              <p>Now, when men get into a clinch like this, it is often a much discussed and publicised topic.</p>
              <p>What about womenfolk? I think that would be an interesting matter to discuss.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Some guys also expect their women to be subservient, goodie-two-shoes material (fags, alcohol and even the occasional swearing are out) that they can bring home to Mum and Dad. Why should women have to subject themselves to an equally-outdated trope just because of their gender?</p>
              <p>When there are people who see men and women as equals, the women who don't practise courtesy will get dirty stares too. If the women don't see themselves as the weaker sex (and thus entitled to every benefit of doubt), they wouldn't glare at the men alone. Give up your seat anyway as a considerate human being first and foremost if you don't subscribe to that point of view.</p>
              <p>It's not actually a refreshing point of view, I'm afraid.</p>

              <p>i'm saying, that to some girls, being gentlemanly is about pleasing her every whim and fancy. you're only a gentleman to her if you pay for every date, and pay for everything on that date etc.</p>
              <p>i'm saying that, being gentlemanly shouldn't be measured by the flawed expectations of women.</p>
              <p>I have heard with my own ears, a girl commenting that she hates guys who don't zi dong buy stuff for her when something catches her eyes. i can paste the youtube here as proof also.</p>
              <p>so i think it's not fair for girls to say that local guys are not gentlemanly, so they decided to upped and go hook an ang mo guy. it's just a pile of hogwash la.</p>
              <p>if being gentlemanly was their only issue, or rather, the lack of it was their only issue, how many of you here are willing to bet with me that, the girls who are now attached with ang mo guys, are willing to go into a long term relationship with a local guy, if he's gentlemanly by nature, but is flawed in every area. He's a perfect gentleman, but maybe he's slightly bald, bespectacled, and chubby.</p>
              <p>how many of you here are willing to bet that she'll drop the ang mo guy and give the local guy a chance?</p>
              <p>that's why i say. it's about the ego, and knowing that your social status has increased. knowing that you have caught the eyes of someone from a higher class.</p>

              <p>What's being a gentleman all about? The way I see it, it's really simply behaving like a considerate and upright person. A decent lady is<br> capable of doing the same thing. The definition that includes pampering womenfolk and giving them the benefit of the doubt all the time<br> without reciprocation is nonsense, and even abuse, to me. You don't have to entertain women who think that way if you don't like it.</p>
              <p>Look at the points in my first post and you'll see that you can apply most of them to any decent and charming person of either gender.</p>
              <p>I won't talk about the situation you mentioned because it's unrealistic. But people choose the easy paths that yield the most reward for<br> the least effort - which is why some girls have given up on local guys and some guys turn to mail-order brides. If they are discerning<br>enough they'll give people of any race who match what they're looking for a chance.</p>

              <p>Haha as a sg guy myself, i will say there is quite true abt us. Sometimes it take u to interact with more ppl from outside that will make u realise the shortcoming u have. Unfortunately I saw alot of ppl who talks like a child in this forum, even after their ns. Esp those who like to compare ns with gals...for christ sake hack it lar! Be a man and serve the nation and you will get the respect u want. </p>
              <p>And also in the article, the point which I agreed the most is the NATO part. Sg guys(including me) needs to improve on this...haha</p>

              <p>because my point is that, there are girls like that. and it's about the ego thing that they go for ang mo guys, and they're just giving excuses about how asian guys don't cut it like ang mo guys.</p>
              <p>my point is that it's not fair to use a flawed sense of what's gentlemanly and what's not to be used as a bench mark for everyone.</p>
              <p>my point is that it's pointless to try to please everyone because they feel that only something is done in a specific way would then qualify as "gentlemanly" or some other good qualities. i think that it's furtile to do so.</p>
              <p>my point is that girls who go for ang mo guys should be honest about why they did so.</p>
              <p>and you blithering idiots are just too busy trying to sound like the
                          holy see, talking about how we bleed the same blood, we're all the same
                          blah blah blah to see my point. which is <strong>"IT'S STUPID TO TRY TO
                          PLEASE EVERYONE, JUST DO THE THINGS YOUR CONSCIENCE ASK YOU TO DO TO BE
                          LOVING TO EVERYONE AROUND YOU. WHY? BECAUSE THEIR IDEA OF WHAT'S
                          GENTLEMANLY ETC IS FLAWED TO BEGIN WITH."</strong></p>
              <p>while your point seem to suggest that you think that what i'm saying is bullcrap because your 20-30 girl friends aren't like that, so you assume that all girls aren't like that because you never came across any (see? same logic of argument here, but i have a higher probability of being right than you)</p>
              <p>actually i don't even know what is the point that you're trying to put across. like are you defending them and that you really think that singaporean guys are ALL ungentlemanly that's why it's only logical that they go for ang mo guys etc?</p>
              <p>oh, i don't know. choosing not to bother was what china did when SARS broke out right?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and don't get me wrong, i'm fine with them hooking with ang mo guys, but don't put on that righteous mask and try to act holy about it. if you went for them because of true love, good for you, if you went for them because of the money or the exotic look, whatever, but be truthful about it.</p>
              <p>i mean, maybe you're right, i hang with the weird crowd where they go goo goo over H.A.M (a new phrase i picked up from another girl i know who seems to want to try to hook one from her clubbing lifestyle).</p>
