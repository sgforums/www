              <p>What's with all this fuss about men being gentlemenly all of a sudden?</p>
              <p>Quite a few men that I know would hold the door open not only for ladies, but even for other chaps. They'd give up their seats for pregnant women, oldfolk, tired-looking women. They seem quite gracious to me.</p>
              <p>Ever seen the movie "A Few Good Men"?</p>
              <p>It's true about good men. There's just a few.</p>
              <p>Though, IMHO, i feel that the same applies for women too.</p>
              <p>I've met my share of "bad guys" too, but again, why this fixation on guys?</p>
              <p>What about the womenfolk?</p>
              <p>Talk about equal rights. When men do it, its wrong, but when women do it, it's okay?</p>
              <p>Only guys should open doors for girls. Only guys should give up the seats for needy people. Only guys should go to NS.</p>
              <p>Guys should suffer, cos they're guys, issit?</p>
              <p>Wow.</p>
              <p>No wonder quite a few guys give up.</p>
              <p>Being guys that is.</p>
              <p>Why don't people complain when it's a <em>girl</em> that doesn't give up her courtesy seat for an old lady. Why doesn't <em>she</em> get dirty stares?</p>
              <p>Kind of puts stuff into different perspective.</p>
              <p>I'm not trying to be condenscending here.</p>
              <p>Just trying to give a different view, different take on this.</p>
              <p>One reason why it's hard to be a guy in SG is this:</p>
              <p>We want to live up to western ideals, but at the same time, keep our asian values at heart.</p>
              <p>Sometimes this is viable. Other times... Not really. Actually, it's very conflicting.</p>
              <p>Now, when men get into a clinch like this, it is often a much discussed and publicised topic.</p>
              <p>What about womenfolk? I think that would be an interesting matter to discuss.</p>

              <p>dumbdumb! might have a point. I think he was pointing out that for an SG gal to go out with an angmoh guy, it serves the ego. It does make sense, after all many asian gals have this mentality that marrying an angmoh equates to 'marrying up'. And why won't marrying up boost any woman's ego?</p>

              <p>This really goes to show how self-dillusioned SOME men are.
                  Being gentlemanly has nothing to do with fat wallets for christ

              <p>i'm saying, that to some girls, being gentlemanly is about pleasing her every whim and fancy. you're only a gentleman to her if you pay for every date, and pay for everything on that date etc.</p>
              <p>i'm saying that, being gentlemanly shouldn't be measured by the flawed expectations of women.</p>
              <p>I have heard with my own ears, a girl commenting that she hates guys who don't zi dong buy stuff for her when something catches her eyes. i can paste the youtube here as proof also.</p>
              <p>so i think it's not fair for girls to say that local guys are not gentlemanly, so they decided to upped and go hook an ang mo guy. it's just a pile of hogwash la.</p>
              <p>if being gentlemanly was their only issue, or rather, the lack of it was their only issue, how many of you here are willing to bet with me that, the girls who are now attached with ang mo guys, are willing to go into a long term relationship with a local guy, if he's gentlemanly by nature, but is flawed in every area. He's a perfect gentleman, but maybe he's slightly bald, bespectacled, and chubby.</p>
              <p>how many of you here are willing to bet that she'll drop the ang mo guy and give the local guy a chance?</p>

              <p>True lei, some ppl will think that way cuz they see angmoh as superior without knowing local one is the best lol. Well, based on ppl's experience la.. who wouldnt hate men/women if they always experienced bad things with the opposite gender. To find the solution to this , angmoh is the best? Depend individual la, angmoh or any local. If there's God, there's Devil, everything has its pro and con.</p>
