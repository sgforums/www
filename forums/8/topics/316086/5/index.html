              <p>Modern Men are actually adapting to Women who doesn't care about making their family work or work for the family. Cheers to those married men who actually do the house chores, and woes to the typical SG girl who's still thinking that hiring a Maid in the family would help at all.</p>
              <p>Mostly, people who can't get married , won't get married, becoz they haven't adjusted their mindset to getting realistically married. One of these problems is "Listening to the wrong advice."</p>

              <ul>

              <p>I don't agree with Nikar's take on (4) - I look at the person rather than all the girls from the same country.</p>
              <p>(6) Football, cars and shopping are all fine, but have other interests, and don't talk about the things that everyone else bangs on about (like betting, modding cars, how fast it goes, the same old tired brands).</p>
              <p>(2) and (9): Take the time to learn new tricks and organise surprises, and learn to dream about wider things than the corporate world, and be ambitious enough to work towards them.</p>
              <p>(11) and (12): It's easy to whine, but it's more respectable to "knuckle down and get on with it". Likewise, politicking is hypocritical; it takes moral courage to ignore the games and stick to working hard and fostering healthy relationships.</p>

              <p>As I mentioned, whatever happened to keeping your head down and getting on with the job? People everywhere are saying the same things about migrants, no matter how strict their governments are with the permits. Just be a bigger asset than the expat. Likewise with girls - just keep and open mind and move on after meeting the bad ones.</p>

              I think the problem is that Singaporean women are westernising in thinking at a much faster rate than their male counterparts. Westernising create higher divorce rate, more arguments and less tolerance and committement to maintain a relationship. 
              
              Dating angmor does not mean that the relationship do not mean that they will end up marrying. 
              
              This is why more Singaporean men ended up marrying woman from Malaysia, China etc. And more Singaporean men and women ended up single or divorce.

                                                <p>i am totally disgusted with our local men... some
                                experience recalls:</p>
                                <p>1. i was holding the door for my mum to go thru at tangs; two
                                well-dressed men followed my mom and walked thru with me still
                                holding the door. they didnt even turn to thank me. talk about gift
                                of god.</p>
                                <p>2. i was on the bus; an old auntie came up, granted she was
                                slow... 3 uni-age chaps pushed past her and caused her to fall
                                forward. one of the chaps went on to grab the courtesy seat meant
                                for elderly/pregnant ladies.</p>
                                <p>3. i was with my sis who was 6 mth pregnant on the MRT. nobody
                                gave up seats for her and all the courtesy seat occupiers (all
                                happen to be our male gender and in their 20-30's) were all in a
                                dormant state with their eyes shut.</p>
                                <p>you can't blame me for dating my ang-moh boyfriend who is
                                funnier, civilised, holds doors for me, plays with my nephews,
                                doesnt mind spending time with my family, cooks for me (and i wash
                                the dishes cos I can't cook). But I dont let him carry my handbag
                                no matter how heavy it gets.</p>
                                <p> </p>
                                <p> </p>

                                no doubt about courtesy to say thx for holding the door, but to expect returns for the simple deed tells alot.
              aww so you can't open your own doors? 
              Oh wait, you have a funny boyfriend who is civilised. Weird though maybe civilised means not sleeping/resting on the trains to you?
              Funny how all local males mind spending time with your family, plaing with your nephews and cooks. Maybe it's not the men but you and your family that's causing that effect. Last I checked there are local men who do those, well not for you and your family of course but in general.
              
              So he has serious urges to carry your handbag and you are trying to cure himof it by making him go cold turkey? Or were you afraid he runs off with your handbag?

              <p>as someone once said. There were 3 cavemen, they see another caveman armed with a spear, screaming bloody murder, one fight, one flees, and one invited him into his cave for some chocolate fondue. the 3rd one didn't live long enough to procreate.</p>
              <p>so natural human response, fight or flee lor.</p>
