              <p>What's being a gentleman all about? The way I see it, it's
                  really simply behaving like a considerate
                  and upright person. A decent lady is<br> capable of doing the same thing. The definition that includes pampering womenfolk and giving them the benefit of the doubt all the time<br> without reciprocation is nonsense, and even abuse, to me.
                  You don't have to entertain women who think that way if you don't
                  like it.</p>
              <p>Look at the points in my first post and you'll see that you can apply most
                  of
                  them to any decent and charming person
                  of either gender.</p>
              <p>I won't talk about the situation you
                  mentioned because it's unrealistic. But people choose the easy
                  paths that yield the most reward for<br> the least effort - which is why some girls have given up on local
                  guys and some guys turn to mail-order brides. If they are
                  discerning<br> enough they'll give people of any race who matches what they're
                  looking for a chance.</p>

              <p>nah. i'm good. i know what you mean really. but i'm just incredulous that there are girls with such narrow mindset, and they veil it with righteousness, like "oh it's not MY fault, that you guys suck" but it's so not true!</p>
              <p>i just dislike that veiling part. really dislike it. i mean, be honest about it. don't try to make yourself look as if you did nothing wrong, when your intentions are wrong. it's such a bold sweeping statement to make. "Oh, because ang mo guys are gentlemanly" so you're trying to say that you like gentlemanly guys.</p>
              <p>but if being gentlemanly is a criteria you're looking for, and you end up with an ang mo, so you're either saying that there're TOTALLY NO gentlemanly guys in singapore, or you're lying. and guess what? it's safer to say that they're lying.</p>

              <p>IMHO, it is not the blatant criticism of SG guys "gentlemenliness" (if there is such a term) that has got the blood pumping, but it is the comparisons between local guys and Ang Moh guys.</p>
              <p>Why? Perhaps it's because the average Ang Moh guy represents ideals and cultures that we'd love to adhere to. And maybe we're just envious of all the attention that they can get, sometimes with a literal snap of their fingers.</p>
              <p>Go to any clubs that have Ang Mohs as an integral part of their patronage and you'll see. If you're an Ang Moh, average looking and of suitable age, you'll got more stares (from both genders) than our local equivalent. I used to work at a club. I know.</p>
              <p>You'd be surprised at the number of ways that our local girls have to attract an Ang Moh's attention.</p>
              <p>I'm not being racially-biased here, I've got quite a few good ang moh friends.</p>
              <p>I've got nothing against them, or any other ethnicities.</p>
              <p>Though I do have beef against generalism (<em>i.e.</em> aiyoh, all guys like dat lah..) and discrimination (<em>i.e. </em>local guys not good lah, french guys best)</p>
              <p>But, if you use the terms favouritism and preference, then I can't say much.</p>
              <p>Aaahh.. the liabilities of language.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, you just can't seem to find the words to put your thoughts across.</p>
              <p>Other times,  it seems that a person is wrong, but can't be proven wrong, as he is right on a technicality.</p>
              <p>Anyway, thanks all for the brain juice. Hear, hear!</p>
