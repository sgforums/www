            <div class='col-md body'>My brothers and I had a conversation about our family and the society around us.<br><br>Since my elder bro has an eleven year gap with my younger bro, they had some minor difficulty in communication. We talked aout the toys we used to play. He-man, Conan, G I Joes, and our big fluffy teddy bears. The toys that my younger bro, only see but did not had the chance to enjoy.<br><br>Then the topic went over to the society these days. That most youngsters would spend a lot of time infront of their pc, gaming away. Elder bro and I kept suggesting that Younger bro should do some sports, to train up his physique and to bring out his character and the right attitude to life. (My family put quite a lot of emphasis on Discipline, Attitude and Mentality.) The essential must-knows to get us through our lives. While Younger bro was busy explaining why youngsters are so different with us back then, I came to realise that children in Singapore these days do not have much of a childhood. They spent most of their time in and out of classrooms for enrichment classes, dance classes and what ever is in the trend. Children these days play electronic games and computer games and as young as Primary 1, they have their own mobile phones. I remember that kids back then, will only have presents when they have good grades. Kids these days "threaten" parents with their grades  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>And about National Service. NS men these days are enjoying the luxury of a six-inch King Koil matteress bed while 5 to 6 years ago, Elder bro was still using those super thin matteress. Most men these days are too used to the good life that they are having now. Men who have gone through hardship during National Service and men these days who slacked through National Service, are poles apart. Take the 2 extremes and observe, you will get the picture.<br><br>Youngsters are getting complacent with life. Although I'm not that old, I feel old. *Lolz* Experiences in life do make a difference. Maybe it had done me bad then good, but it taught me something. Never to get complacent. Never to take anyone for granted, especially your family.<br><br>From the day we were brought to this world, we are conditioned to be who we are today. We never had a Chance to Choose what we want to be. I'm glad I was conditioned well. That I had the ability to differentiate or analyse situations and people well. Conditioned me to see things in a different light. Although I'm more pessismistic then my friends, I believe I can anticipate certain things coming that most of them don't.<br><br>Who doesn't like to appreciate the finer things in life? But even before we do that, maybe we should start appreciating the people around us, the life around us and how fortunate we are.<br><br></div>

U cannot use ur idea of "childhood" to compare with what your younger brother has. To him, this is his kind of "childhood" and I don't think there is a fair way to compare which is the better. Should I compare your "childhood" to those of our grandparents or parents? Those who lived in kampongs, who rears pigs, etc? Are they any better and ours worse?<br><br><blockquote>And about National Service.
