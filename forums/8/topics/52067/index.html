            <div class='col-md body'>Beware of a company called Interval Resorts Network. They use high pressure selling techniques that are unscrupulous. They are at 230, Orchard Road, #06-230 Faber House S(238854) Tel: 68356485. This is my story:<br>An innocent school boy, appeared to me at Dhoby Gaut station, asking me to fill a survey form. . To oblige him, I did and following that, I was given 2 scratch cards. One of them said I had won for myself a free 1 week hotel stay of my choice(from China, France, Portugal, Canary Islands etc). I was about to go off when the boy(plus another woman who appeared) convinced me it was genuine. They had a company taxi ready, to ferry me off to their office to claim the prize.<br>At their office, there were many people lured by the same promises like myself.<br>After a long wait, the salesman showed up. I had to switch off my handphone before entering the room(to avoid consultations with external parties). I was quizzed about my travel style, lifestyle, then was hard-pushed to consider their travel concept. Luxury hotels I can only dream of having, at a price I can afford. The video, trophies(ISO certification) , photos, brochures etc were totally convincing. Martim kept showing me his membership card and explained how pleased he is as a member. After the 4 hour long talk, the manager, showed up and gave me the price of joining. It was S$28,000. It was just too much for me and they kept asking, "is it just the price? we can lower it for you" Suddenly the studio flat that was unavailable before became available. They had been pushing me to get the 6 person suite, which costs more of course. To convince me, they showed me some kind of faxed letter saying that people with the studio were upgrading to larger units, hence explaining the sudden availability of the studio. When I wasn't able to pay the yearly maintenance fee of US$350, they suddenly said I could go for the alternate year scheme..As a result of these "downgrades" and for signing up on the spot with cash(on credit card), they were able to reduce the joining fee to only $11,000. Then if I cashed the travel voucher I had won from the survey, I could save another $10,000. From $28,000 it had become $10,000. It just looked good on paper.<br>As I was prepared to leave to sign the official papers, I asked if I could keep those illustrations the salesman had done for me. They said "No" because I was going to get everything in a nice little package anyway.<br>I think I was shivering at that moment, a clear signal that something was wrong. When I finally signed on the dotted line, it became clear that I had made the wrong decision. I felt nauseous that night and couldn't sleep. I got up, surfed the internet and then found that Interval Resort Network is one of the scam companies to look out for. There are blacklisted at http://www.crimeshare.net<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thank you, but I hope that more people will be aware of such things happening and will not be tricked by them. They ply the streets of Orchard Road with their innocent looking survey forms. More people will be duped if they are allowed to continue.<br>Can justice ever be done then?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>On hindsight it it stupid but they are extremely slick and well choreographed. They use coercive techniques and unfair tactics in making their customers sign. Ultimately it's the consumer's rights, yes, but consumer's rights is not very well understood to many. Much less the existence of these rougue companies who must have been tricking people like this for years. Perhaps many of these tricked people are still in the dark..Timeshare fraud originated in Europe but it has now come to Singapore. That's why we need to bring this to our attention as soon as possible.<br><br>Found a site that offers support to victims of such scams.It's at http://www.geocities.com/hcspore03<br>Apparently, they are pulling people together to fight the crooks.</div>
