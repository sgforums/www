            <div class='col-md body'>Cos not all gays have the choice of determining their sexual orientation and that is why the cause of debate if male homosexuality is born or bred. There are males from young under influence of the female dominated environment will actually become more feminine and thus the passive side of the gay's world<br><br>There are single guys outside who are gays but cannot help themselves of being as 'normal' as other families. And in order for them to feel fatherly love, therefore adoption or rearing pets become a way of expressing their love...<br><br>To look into the Male homosexuality sexual dimporphism cannot determine if he is really biological but as for me, I strongly think it is more of bred than born...<br><br>But not because they are gay ...they have to be ostracised, as long they are not a menace to the society and are a good tribute to the society...live and let live<br><br>I have some real bad experience with them too but still I still think that it is not entirely their fault...and to know if there is chance to be straight is still a big question mark...it depends if they think it is the external factors that induce them to deny their gender or really internal factors..in short...it is their mentality that determines the conclusion of their final destiny<br><br>------------------<br>Writing is a weapon that is more powerful than a man's fist.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah...I also think that homosexuality is bred not born. I belive that we are all born straight, born normal. Perhaps it is the experiences they have with the opposite sex that caused them to be like this. There must be a strong force that happened whilst they are young that caused a huge change in their way of thinking..<br><br>But what I am concerned is the child that they adopt. What will the public think of this child? And if you were this child, how will you feel?<br><br>------------------<br>The Prince Of Death...<br>______________<br>| |Ã” NiVleK Ã” | |<br><br>[This message has been edited by NiVleK (edited 22 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Homosexuality is more accepted compared of in the past...if the father can provide a good father love and also to provide a good education..I dun see why should the kid feel 'ashamed' or whatsoever ... even his peers were to boo him...he should stand proud and tell them "If not for my gay dad, I won't be here lecturing u kids on how to respect someone who gave one second life!And shame on you and please climb all the way home and wear your soiled diapers!"<br><br>It does not matter if one parent is gay or not...the most important is the nurturing of the kid from the gay dad from young that he shall not be look down upon and he is as normal as other kids...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 22 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Gays probably have desires and need to have children like the rest of us. Since they can't do it biologically, adoption will have to be one of the ways to achieve that.<br><br>I think that for a child to grow up optimally there should be parents of 2 genders. I don't think a man can give what a woman can give, and vice versa, because men and women behave differently. The influence their behaviour will have to the child will also differ. Thats my own viewpoint.<br><br>Not to say that no good can come of it. I'm just saying that thats not optimal. Neither is having a traditional family with lousy parents.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think recently i read a report bout gays having found a 'donor womb'...someone who was willing to carry thier child... the foetus had both of the gays genes... Besides..i think for every gay, lesbian couple..there will b a ;passive' n 'active partner'...so i think there will b motherly love from the 'passive' one</div>
