            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sleepycat:</div><div class="quote_body">How about Canon PowerShot SD20?</div></blockquote>The Canon PowerShot SD20 Digital ELPH is what I call a "secondary camera". It's the go-anywhere camera that's always on hand to capture the moment. For more serious endeavors, that's where you bring out your primary camera -- the PowerShot G6, Coolpix 8700, whatever. With that in mind, the SD20 is a very nice ultra-compact camera that can fit in your pocket, ready for action at any time. It takes very good 5 Megapixel photos without major delays like shutter lag. The camera is mostly point-and-shoot, though I appreciate the manual white balance and long shutter speed controls. The camera has an AF-assist lamp for focusing in low light, though I found it hard to see anything on the LCD in those conditions.<br><br>With the tiny body come several trade-offs. For one, you'll get plenty of redeye and a limited flash range. The lens is fixed at 39mm, which isn't great for wide-angle shots as you might imagine. Purple fringing was a bit higher than average, as well. Canon's movie mode isn't very good either, with slow frame rates and short recording times. Lastly, battery life isn't as good as you'd find on a larger camera with a more powerful battery.<br><br>All-in-all, the SD20 is a compact, stylish camera that you can bring everywhere. I wouldn't buy it as a primary camera but for something you can always have with you, it gets the thumbs up.<br><br>What I liked:<br>Very good photo quality<br>Stylish, compact body; comes in four colors<br>Manual white balance + slow shutter speed controls<br>AF-assist lamp<br>Optional all-weather case<br>Impressive software package<br><br>What I didn't care for:<br>LCD doesn't "gain up" in low light (or not very much, at least)<br>No optical zoom; lens fixed at a not-so-wide 39mm<br>No optical viewfinder<br>Weak flash, major redeye<br>Movie mode has low frame rate, short recording times<br>Battery life isn't fabulous<br><br>Some other high resolution, ultra-compact cameras worth looking at include the Canon PowerShot SD300 Digital ELPH, Casio Exilim EX-Z50 and EX-Z55, Fuji FinePix F450, Kodak EasyShare LS753, Konica Minolta DiMAGE X50, Olympus AZ-2 Zoom and Stylus Verve, Panasonic Lumix DMC-FX7, Pentax Optio S5i, and the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-L1 and DSC-T1.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No problem!<br><br>About Olympus, actually IÂ’ve got one as well, but a rather cheepy one; the 2.0 MP D-380. IÂ’ve never had any problem with it. ItÂ’s simple, compact, sleek and smooth. Well no matter what, itÂ’s still a $200 camera, so obviously its quality canÂ’t be compared to ones that are $500+.<br>Here in Canada, itÂ’s a pretty popular camera apart from Nikon and Canon, and IÂ’ve never heard any complaints about it.<br><br>For your $800 budget and 5.0+ MP requirements, I can recommend you the following:<br>Olympus C60: 6.1 MP<br>Olympus Stylus 500: 5.0 MP<br>Olympus C5500: 5.1 MP<br>Olympus C5060: 5.1 MP<br><br>As for the Nikons, these are quite reasonable:<br>Nikon Coolpix 5200: 5.1 MP<br>Nikon Coolpix 5400: 5.1 MP<br><br>I have no experience about Panasonic, so unfortunately I can't say much about it, though it seems quite O.K according to people's review at http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/specs/Panasonic/ so you might as well give it a try.<br><br>As IÂ’m sure you have your own preferences in choosing a camera, it would be advisable to take a look at some sample pics at:<br>http://www.dcresource.com/reviews/cameraList.php (find the camera of your choice, and click the Â“RÂ” icon if availableÂ”<br>http://www.dpreview.com/ (on the left sind, put your mouse over Â“CamerasÂ” and select the brand of your choice)<br>and last but not least: http://www.steves-digicams.com/hardware_reviews.html<br><br>You may also read what people say from the above sites, and you can also go read peopleÂ’s reviews at Amazon.com since I feel itÂ’s also worth looking at.<br><br>IÂ’m not sure how urgent you would like to get a camera, but if you donÂ’t mind waiting and saving some more money, IÂ’d DEFINITELY recommend the Nikon D-70 SLR. ItÂ’s a really versatile camera, extremely high quality, and FAST!! In here itÂ’s about CAD$ 1.100, which translates to roughly SGD$ 1.400, according to xe.com (youÂ’re in Singapore yes?) and for an SLR I think itÂ’s quite a bargain. Its rival such as the Canon EOS 20D is almost CAD$ 2.000 (Â± SGD$ 2.600) and I think itÂ’s a little bit too much, at least for me whoÂ’s a university student.<br><br>I hope that helps!!<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>OrneryBoy made a good point. If you do not plan to print your pics, it won't hurt to get a 4.0 MP camera. I think that it's better to invest your money in a good quality, cheaper 4.0 MP camera rather than a "low class" more expensive 5.0 MP camera, because I don't think they make a big difference.<br><br>Anyway, I took the following two pics yesterday by Nikon Coolpix 4800. I guess they're quite ok. The lower pic is a 1 cm zoom by the way.<br><br>I made them small so they don't appear at their best, but I think that should do it.......<br>I like how the snow's still clean  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><img src="http://65.108.91.146/DSCN1853kecil.jpg"><br><img src="http://65.108.91.146/DSCN1842kecil.jpg"></div>
