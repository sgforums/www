But anyway, have they even ever put people in jail for being homosexuals? If they are placed in a male prison, would they be segregated or isolated?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No. They are kept together with other prisoners of the same sex. Don't think they would be so daft as to let the other inmates know they are gay...that would be just asking to be raped...<br><br>The case in question is about drug possession, but there is a worrying trend emerging with the confluence of the gay and drug cultures. This is an excerpt from a gay website:<br>"Whilst the British government makes plans to curb the behaviour of drunken louts in our city centres, as well as addressing the explosion in binge drinking, gay drug culture is as active as ever. <strong>Why does the gay scene attract so much drug use? </strong>Are some drugs gayer than others? What are the measures being put in place to deal with the problem? Read on and find out moreÂ…<br><br>What is the extent of the problem?<br>According to the Midwest AIDS Prevention Project in the US, alcohol and drug abuse affects an estimated 20-30% of gay and lesbian people - <strong>a rate that is two to three times higher than the general population</strong>."<br><br>http://www.rainbownetwork.com/Features/detail.asp?iData=21450&amp;iCat=30&amp;iChannel=25&amp;nChannel=Features<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>we can hv 1000 opinions,but there is only 1 facts.<br><blockquote><strong><a href="http://www2.mha.gov.sg/mha/detailed.jsp?artid=2015&amp;type=4&amp;root=0&amp;parent=0&amp;cat=0" rel="nofollow">.....In fact, Yeo would not have been of any interest to CNB otherwise; it was his drug abuse</a></strong> which led CNB to investigate him in the first place. When Yeo was asked if he had any drugs, Yeo volunteered to bring drugs to the hotel where he was subsequently arrested with Ecstasy, Â‘IceÂ’, and Ketamine....<br><br>One of the concerns this trend raises is the mentality of certain segments of our society who think that synthetic drugs are Â“softÂ” drugs which should be tolerated as they are acceptable as part of a modern Â“coolÂ” lifestyle. This is a dangerous attitude which we must not allow to take root in our society.<br><br>4 The ST editorial also suggested that because Yeo is a taxi-driverÂ’s son who made it as a doctor, but whose future is now uncertain, the action taken against him will Â“reinforce in some people a sense that natural justice had been violated.Â” This is a strange argument. Surely the ST is not suggesting that the CNB action would be fairer and more just if Yeo had been related to a person of high social standing? ........</blockquote>This shold be made known clearly---Yeo had been a drug abuser before he<br>was arrested.<br><br>Dunt tolerate soft drug.All the cool pple should be arrested as<br>an old uncle consuming opium.<br><br>It was pity he came fr a poor family.But law should  blind.</div>
