Nobody is being anal(pun not intended  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ) here, as far as anyone can see. I certainly hope u're not being anal in suggesting others are being anal here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I think u did not manage to grasp, that any suggestions of discriminations are against threadstarter himself, and the people who make similiar insinuations.</div>

I based my statements on what his post said and objectively, there was nothing homophobic about what he posted and so thats why I rather that we not look into what he could have meant and discuss objectively about his topic. If he is really homophobic, by bringing it up again, we are just playing into his game rite?</div>
