            <div class='col-md body'>I thought the main issue is not whether he's gay or straight, but whether the CNB overstepped its authority through excessive entrapment. And in this case I believe they did. I think no legitimate government has the right to entice its citizens to commit crimes. It's okay if the person is a known criminal and they need to amass evidence to put him away. But it's wrong to entrap someone who has never committed the crime before. If they wanted to catch the doctor for drug abuse it's fine by me, but if he never sold drugs before they shouldn't have employed such forceful methods to make him do it then prosecute him for it. In every society there are weak individuals who find it difficult to walk the narrow path on the right side of the law. The state should help such people stay the path, not lure them towards the fall.</div>
