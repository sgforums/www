So that's why Europe/Aus disallow China apples/vege, US /Mex want to control quota of China fabrics and clothes.  Only sg stupid.. open arms and act like a pros. but its a matter of balance.. You are not immerse in their culture and you are just judging them from our point of view. So do not comment about good or bad. Cause there is no absolutes. As long as it works for them .. who are you to say which is better. Anyways, you have a very shallow view of so many things.. I shan't go any further<br></div>
