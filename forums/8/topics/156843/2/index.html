This is a sad sad day.<br><br>You see someone in need. Do you just walk away? Or are you one of those morons that stand around waiting for the poor soul to utter 4 digits? The basic fabric of human nature is a thing called compassion. If you are a religious person, SHAME ON YOU. I'm not. And I don't need religion to tell me that the able bodied have a responsibility to help the less fortunate. Whether by circumstance or by fate, these people were dealt a bad hand and people like you and me, who have a little more luck, have this responsibility to do so.<br><br>Let me ask you something. Where do you think social welfare came from? It came from human beings with a soul. People with a conscience. Why did the government step in? Because they are in a better position to facilitate and spread the help where it is needed. The government's high vantage point allows it to efficiently distribute and regulate resources that are channelled to such organizations. If it was left to people like you, I shudder to think of the consequences.<br><br>That being said, being in a better position does not TRANSFER RESPONSIBILITY. People have got the whole notion and concept of a government wrong. The government isn't some maid or servant you pay off (with taxes) to do your dirty work. Now I know i'm inviting responses from many who will hammer me for that statement. I'm not saying our government is doing a fantastic job at potraying that image. I'm saying that social welfare SHOULD NOT  be the full responsibility of the government. The government has the responsibility to EFFICIENTLY channel the nation's pooled resources into needy organizations. Where does this pool of resources come from? Us!<br><br>Oh please don't tell me that "since the government blahblahblah they should devote their time and work in old folks home since blahblahblah you said that money is the lowest form of charity."  If you even have the nerve to think that way, take a deep breath and walk away from the computer. Don't argue for argument's sake against me. Open your narrow little mind a little more and you will see the light.<br><br>Good luck with that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There is a response from Dr Lee Wei Ling in today's papers to a letter written in response to her statements.<br><br>I read the response by our average singaporeans to her outburst. However, i have not managed to read what Dr Lee said in response to those replies.<br><br>As always, whether the original letters were censured or edited in some way, the response from the public appeared nothing but subdued and benign, perhaps heavily censored for fear of reprisals.<br><br>In fact, the letters were absolutely gentle and spoke of Singaporean's compassion towards the needy and poor seeking medical aid. There was zero criticism of the person who started this ruckus (or pehaps censored out completely by our beloved ST).<br><br>I can imagine her response to be : 'oh i was mis-quoted....that's not what i meant"...<br><br>anyone read it to confirm or refute the above?</div>
