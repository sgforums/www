Cos, most of them doesn't know the URL or etc. So what is the 'convenience' refering abt?<br><br>2. Online products are intangible, you can feel or touch. However, people who shop online often sae that online stores often products enough details, such as measurement, and etc. However, from your pt of views, do you think that details are sufficient? Any ideas on what other details would one like to know when sourcing for online products??<br><br>3.
