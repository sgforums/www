            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">by Boat Kway</span><br><br>A new rule aimed at foiling terrorists has been introduced by the police. It essentially targets terrorists using the tactic of carbombs to wreak havoc and destruction.<br><br>'It was really very simple,' said police spokesperson ASP Khoo Hock Chye. 'We were brainstorming late one night after the Bali bomb blasts on how to foil their dastardly acts when it dawned on us, quite literally at 6am, that we really had the answer all along. All we had to do was to draw those yellow zig-zagged lines indicating "No parking or waiting" along favourite nightspots along Mohammed Sultan and voila, those terrorists can't park a carbomb there anymore. Violators will either be fined, jailed, bastinadoed or, most painfully, have their cars impounded and licenses revoked.'<br><br>'It will also make it easier for we cops to find a parking place when we want to raid them whenever we run short of drugs or fail to meet our quotas for arresting criminals,' interjected Police Chief Ma Tah Chia.<br><br>When quizzed by journalists on how that would stop a terrorist as they would be unlikely to follow the traffic rules, ASP Khoo retorted, ' We're quite sure they would, our brilliant team of police scholars just out of ANUS have assured us on this fact. Given our stringent immigration checks coupled with our intelligence, the profile of such a terrorist in Singapore is most likely to be a Singaporean himself. As we all know, Singaporeans all very law-abiding one, threaten to fine him, jail him or impound his car is most effective. Even so, we're not taking any chances, we're increasing the tariffs and COE prices to deter people from the lower castes from buying cars thus limiting the chances of a carbomb. Even if the terrorists were so brazen as to target such areas, the fact that making it unfavourable for parking cars there would mean that more expats will not want to got to such areas where there will be unhealthy mixing with the lower orders but to other government designated places meant for them where it's safer. The loss to Singapore will therfore be comparatively less.'<br><br>Said Police Chief Ma at the end of the press briefing, 'We expect this to be a huge blast. In fact, we're planning to extend this to other areas where a terrorist may park his car or truck unnoticed. Currently, new areas to be designated "No parking or waiting" include indoor carparks, hotel drop off points and goods unloading bays. We have also plans to introduce new lines at embassies and other gahmen buildings. One for normal visitors and one for terrorists. There will also be an express lane for those who are carrying bombs below 5kg.'<br><br>from <a href="http://www.talkingcock.com" rel="nofollow">www.talkingcock.com</a></div>
