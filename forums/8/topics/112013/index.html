Founded 16 years after the arrival of the Pilgrims at Plymouth, the University has grown from nine students with a single master to an enrollment of more than 18,000 degree candidates, including undergraduates and students in 10 principal academic units. An additional 13,000 students are enrolled in one or more courses in the Harvard Extension School. Over 14,000 people work at Harvard, including more than 2,000 faculty. There are also 7,000 faculty appointments in affiliated teaching hospitals.<br><br>Seven presidents of the United States Â– John Adams, John Quincy Adams, Theodore and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Rutherford B. Hayes, John Fitzgerald Kennedy and George W. Bush Â– were graduates of Harvard. Its faculty have produced 40 Nobel laureates.<br><br>Harvard College was established in 1636 by vote of the Great and General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and was named for its first benefactor, John Harvard of Charlestown, a young minister who, upon his death in 1638, left his library and half his estate to the new institution. Harvard's first scholarship fund was created in 1643 with a gift from Ann Radcliffe, Lady Mowlson.<br><br>During its early years, the College offered a classic academic course based on the English university model but consistent with the prevailing Puritan philosophy of the first colonists. Although many of its early graduates became ministers in Puritan congregations throughout New England, the College was never formally affiliated with a specific religious denomination. An early brochure, published in 1643, justified the College's existence: "To advance Learning and perpetuate it to Posterity; dreading to leave an illiterate Ministry to the Churches."</div>

The Institute has more than 900 faculty and 10,000 undergraduate and graduate students. It is organized into five Schools -- Architecture and Planning, Engineering, Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences, Management, and Science -- and the Whitaker College of Health Sciences and Technology. Within these are thirty-three degree-granting departments, programs, and divisions. In addition, a great deal of research and teaching takes place in interdisciplinary programs, laboratories, and centers whose work extends beyond traditional departmental boundaries. The board of trustees, known as the Corporation, consists of about 75 national and international leaders in higher education, business and industry, science, engineering and other professions. Forty-seven alumni, faculty, researchers and staff have won Nobel Prizes.<br><br>William Barton Rogers, the Institute's founding President, believed that education should be both broad and useful, enabling students to participate in "the humane culture of the community" and to discover and apply knowledge for the benefit of society. His emphasis on "learning by doing," on combining liberal and professional education, and on the value of useful knowledge, continues to be at the heart of MIT's educational mission.<br><br>MIT's commitment to innovation has led to a host of scientific break-throughs and technological advances. Achievements of the Institute's faculty and graduates have included the first chemical synthesis of penicillin and vitamin A, the development of inertial guidance systems, modern technologies for artificial limbs, and the magnetic core memory that made possible the development of digital computers. Exciting current areas of research and education include neuroscience and the study of the brain and mind, bioengineering, the environment and sustainable development, information sciences and technology, new media, financial technology, and entrepreneurship.<br><br>University research is one of the mainsprings of growth in an economy increasingly defined by technology. In the first national study of the economic impact of a research university, "The Impact of Innovation," the BankBoston Economics Department found that graduates of MIT have founded 4,000 firms, translating their knowledge into products, services, and jobs. These firms, in 1994, employed over one million people and generated worldwide revenues of $232 billion.<br><br>MIT has forged educational and research collaborations with other universities, governments, and companies throughout the nation and the world, and draws its faculty and students from every corner of the globe. The result is a vigorous mix of people, ideas, and programs dedicated to enhancing the world's wellbeing.<br><br>Most (70 percent) of the research conducted on the MIT campus is supported by the US government, but the Institute is a national leader in the amount of such funding received from private industry (nearly 20 percent).<br><br>(WHO'S NEXT TO KEEP GUESSING?!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> )</div>

But the University's museums and collections also hold many treasures which give an exciting insight into some of the scholarly activities, both past and present, of the University's academics and students.<br><br>The University of Cambridge is one of the oldest universities in the world and one of the largest in the United Kingdom. Its reputation for outstanding academic achievement is known world-wide and reflects the intellectual achievement of its students, as well as the world-class original research carried out by the staff of the University and the Colleges.<br><br>Many of the University's customs and unusual terminology can be traced to roots in the early years of the University's long history, and this booklet looks to the past to find the origins of much that is distinctive in the University of today.</div>
