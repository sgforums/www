It ain't a perfect movie but if u dun pick on it like a petty schoolgirl, u'll find it to be as good and entertaining as e original. There's humour, action and moral msg for kids and adults alike.

            <div class='col-md body'>I just caught the show yesterday. I think overall, it was quite a nice movie. Highly-entertaining. The special effects nowadays really has quite reached its peak. The tenacles of Dr. Octopus looked so damn real.<br><br>The movie has quite covered up lots of its flaws, and tried to stick to its originality as close as possible. Like his emotional detachment hindered his web-slinging ability, and as in the comics, the webs are actually gadgets provided to him. At least, not as in part 1, whereby his webs seemed "free-flow" and never-ending.<br><br>The sequel is showing that a superhero, afterall, has his own vulnerablilty.<br><br>Hopefully, Venom will appear in part 3. Cause I believe all of us should have already know that Harry is going to take after his father's shoes.</div>
