            <div class='col-md body'><br>Rating: PG<br>Language: Korean<br>Genre: Horror<br>Main Cast: Shim Hye-jin, Kim Jin-Geun, Moon Woo-Bin<br>Director: Park Ki-Hyeong<br>Release Date: 4 March 2004<br>Running Time: 104 minutes<br><br><img src="http://www.asiandb.com/data/poster/org/5274.jpg"><br><br>Mi-sook is a textile artist. She is married to Do-il, an obstetrician. They have lived a happy life with Do-il's father. But the couple couldn't have a baby for years, so they decide to adopt a child. In an office of one orphanage, Mi-sook finds a painting of the tree very similar to Munch's "Scream". Once when she was a judge of the art competition for children, she saw the exact same painting. Mi-sook gets attracted to that painting and decides to adopt Jin-sung who drew that picture.<br><br>After the adoption, Mi-sook, Do-il and Jin-sung seem to get along quite well, but Mi-sook's mother doesn't like Jin-sung. The happiness of Jin-sung suddenly breaks when Mi-sook finally gets pregnant and gives a birth to her own baby boy. Gradually Jin-sung gets neglected by his family.<br><br>Feeling he has been alienated, Jin-sung starts to show very unusual affection toward an acacia tree in their garden. He heard his real mother hung herself on an acacia tree, so he believes his dead mother became a tree. Meanwhile, he makes a friend with Min-ji, a mysterious girl next door, and hangs around with her often. When Jin-sung tries to stop the baby crying, Mi-sook's mother misunderstands that he tries to harm the baby and scolds him. One rainy night, Jin-sung overhears Mi-sook's mother talking to Mi-sook to send him back to the orphanage, and he dashes out of the house and disappears.<br><br>After missing of Jin-sung, the acacia tree comes into full bloom, and emits deep scent of acacia flower into whole house and strange things begins to happenÂ… Mi-sook sees bloody Jin-sung in the dream, gets afflicted with the phantom of him. Mi-sook's mother falls down spiting blood while smelling scent of the acacia flowerÂ… Do-il who was warm-hearted man becomes a cold-hearted tough man who dares to do a surgical operation to cause abortion even though the patient comes out of the ether and screams. In the meantime, Mi-sook's father in law gets attacked by a swarm of ants and dies by the acacia tree.<br><br>One night, after Do-il finds one wall of his living room full of Jin-sung's drawings, he assaults and rapes Mi-sook burning with indignation. Few days later, Do-il finds Jin-sung's bicycle stained with blood in front of the porch, and dashes into the house in a fury. Inside of his house, all the furniture is tied around blood red thread and it leads Do-il to 2nd floor and takes him into Mi-sook's workroom.<br><br>Plowing his way through tapestries hung in Mi-sook's workroom, Do-il finally finds a loom and a tapestry which depicts Do-il killing Jin-sung. Do-il, crying in distress, runs to the garden and tries to cut down the tree, but Mi-sook stabs him with a scissor and stabs herself.<br><br>On the night of Jin-sung's missing, Jin-sung was running to acacia tree and Mi-sook, being enraged with Jin-sung's inordinate affection towards the tree, lifted up an axe to cut down the treeÂ… But what she hit was not the tree but Jin-sung's forehead. After the accident, Do-il buried Jin-sung by the tree. But jin-sung's white hand poped out of the ground and wriggled. Shcoked Do-il kept hitting the hand. Mi-sook lost her mind, and kept thinking Jin-sung is just missing. But, Min-ji, the girl next door saw everything.</div>
