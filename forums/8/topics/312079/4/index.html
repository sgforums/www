              <p>sorry to burst your bubble, but confidence, courage, humour and wit are trained throughout the entire daily doings, like the type of people you interact with. if you work at McD, then probably you won't have it. but can't say so if you're working somewhere else</p>
              <p>talking to more people definitely helps</p>

              <p>Well there's the problem in your own words Fairytail.</p>
              <p>So if the SG guy is an entertainer, then you will smile. The guy
              has to make 110% effort, be trained as a professional entertainer,
              be armed with wit, humour, courage, confidence, intellect, thick
              skin (" we will reject them flat"..sheesh...girl thinks she's judge
              and executioner) and outgoingness vibes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              </div>
              <div>SG guys have to spend their whole life studying for
              exams and are mummy boys. Where will they get time to suddenly
              change their whole persona? Who will teach them? Certainly not
              "Executioner" Fairytail and her friends.</div>

              <p>In a pub or disco, she looks the other way when you look at her, does tat not sound like a signal to F-off? I find it so in my POV.</p>
              <p>No eye contacts does not mean do not try, but just that the feeling is as if she is not interested. Still, if you don't try, you will never know. At the most is rejection, you are not going to die right? So there, courage issued solved. Just need a little.... thicker skin and personal esteem. Not asking you to kill a person, just asking you to approach and talk.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, I feel that we should learn how the ang moh guys behave and carry themselves. I have been observing some ang moh guys at St James. NO ! I am not gay. Not all of the managed to strike well. But those who did, I noticed that they are charismatic. Very charismatic indeed. Topics they talked about is pretty general, like the band that is playing right now, the singers etc. But that shows some knowledge and wisdom. The way they carry themselves and the confidence they project.. Woo! Full marks! And off course, the nice thick fat wallet tugged out when paying for that drink is additional bonus.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SOME</span></strong> SG guys have really no intelligence nor wisdom.... really need to learn something or do some homework to strike a decent conversation!</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Some</strong></span> SG guys try and they behave like some coloured wolf in wool.  Failed trying and ended up only looking at the boobs....</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Some</strong></span> behave like desperados.... Nuff said bout those....</p>
              <p>Still, there are some nice guys out there who carries themselves well, converse with intelligence and wisdom, but they are GAY! Damn.....</p>
