              <p>usually there are good and bad shows. Some shows have a very good music and songs and its about romance, I these movies, normally the actress will be drop dead gorgeous.</p>
              <p>There are other tye of shows whcih are thriller or action variety. still, thee are others like ocean 12 kind of shows especially in hindi. I think they express themselves with songs, this trait which actually made their movies famous worldwide, especially in english speaking countries who have embraced these movies as they remind them of their own soap opera or broadway musicals.</p>

              <p>i am not sure, but their fathers are not good looking i think. Genes work strangely in them i think. maybe its partly because the indian race is a sub branch of the caucasian race. they share the same genes.</p>

              <p>but overseas countries , i was staying, i knew many indian girls are much better looking than the ones found in singapore.</p>

              <p>Certainly, Indian gals are Miss Universe before.. they sure look nice lor..but i believe it is their culture, it seem like those young good looking indian gals like to marry older 40++ man, funny leh. And to them, fat, beard and older men is consider mature and nice..of course not very fat lah.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I did asked one of my indian gfren, she said, moustache and fat shows a manly, rich, stable and mature man. Only those in poor village are thin, unstable and no money to grow a nice moustache.</p>

              <p>Moustache = In indian culture , is to supprt respect for your father.</p>
              <p>Anyone in the world who stays in a village - Has an unstable life and with no money .</p>
              <p>Most rich or highly educated women , usually prefer to marry a man who is older because , he is ready to settle down and is somewhere in his career.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Well as an Indian what I have to say is different part of India the climate is different. In southest part some places are much hotter than the north and some of e south. If you differentiate ugly and beautiful by color, then north indians and malayalees are good looking. They are quiet fair. you can take for neena varghes(mediacord news anchor). By her name I guess she is a malayalee. North Indian will much more fare than south. we dont have any color discrimination as it is a multi racial and multi cultural and multi religious community. Cheers..... And guys and girls are all good looking. the main thing is that best looking guys are not turning to an actor.LOL.... and I have got comments from my chinese friends that I am one of e best Indian guy they have seen...:-)..... just kiddin</p></div>
