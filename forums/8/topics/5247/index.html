While I admit the girls are pretty, the picture taken of the girl's panty was quite tasteless.<br><br>But now I wonder. What does women dressed in cropped tops and short skirts got to do with motorcars? I mean, it should be the motorcars being featured, and not the women right? Or am I missing something here?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sex sells.  its as simple as that.  motorcars gather the interest of mostly guys and well, few guys will not be captivated by attractive girls in skimpy clothes.<br><br>take a look @ the traditional beer ads for example.  utterly tasteless (who in the world can picture those beer drinkers like the ahpek @ coffeeshops doing sporty stuff like windsurfing and hugging chesty ladies?).  but hey, those ads must have been running for more than a decade already!<br><br>[This message has been edited by SeCrEts (edited 06-12-1999).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by SeCrEts (edited 06-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>girls and cars. for those of you who have been worried sick abt the correlation, and are having sleepless nites worrying abt how the correlation could ever stand, i have decided to offer three (yes, 3) theories which may help explain the connection. remember, only read on if u are (i) as free as i am, (ii) as bo liao as i am or (iii) cannot sleep until you realise how the connection could exist.<br><br>now that you have determined which category you fall under, let me proceed.<br><br>i shall adumbrate three theories of the relation between women and cars, as seen from the anthropological, scientific and religio-mythical perspectives respectively.<br><br>1. The Anthropological Connection (aka The Tarzan Theory of Motion)<br><br>In the very beginning, there was Man (let's call him Tarzan - *beats chest*). Tarzan had a problem with transportation in the very dense jungles of...erm...Africa. Walking was a chore (and occasionally a danger) and at that time there were no hush puppies. Anthropological studies have shown that Tarzan eventually solved this problem by climbing up trees and swinging from branch to branch. Jungle vines became a sure source of quick and easy transportation. The wind in the hair, the ability to slow down or quicken up depending on Tarzan's mood, and the sheer sensation of feeling that he was flying like a bird.<br><br>But where was Tarzan going? Why was he in such a hurry? Why, to meet Jane of course. Jane was the reason why it was cooler to swing from branch to branch and the reason why Tarzan decided to invest in good jungle vines.<br><br>With the coming of the modern age, however, the industrial revolution razed everything. It cut down the jungles and rainforests and left Tarzan with no means of transportation and no way to take Jane for a leisurely swing in the park.<br><br>In came the sports car to save the day. Now, with the invention of the sports car, Tarzan could take Jane on a heart-pounding, wind-blowing, hair-sculpting ride, reminiscent of the days of old. Hence, the connection between speed and transportation and women, from the anthropological point of view.<br><br>2. The Scientific Connection (aka Particle T-Particle J Theory of Electromagnetic Attraction)<br><br>Inspired by the anthropological explanation of motion, scientists wondered if not all of nature could be explained by the theories of motion. However, what puzzled them was the measure of force that was operational in the universe to explain this motion. What kind of energy existed that could account for all and any kind of motion? Thus came the hypothesis of Particle T (for Tarzan) and Particle J (for Jane of course).<br><br>Under controlled laboratory conditions (see the article by Tok Kok and Si Bey Eng - 1986), scientists discovered that two separate and distinct particles were themselves responsible for all energy flows throughout the universe. The theory goes thus: in the very beginning, at the moment of the big bang, the two particles T and J were formed and were thrown out throughout the universe at incredible speeds. It appears as if particle T was always chasing after particle J, as if in hot pursuit. The faster particle T was, the more chances it had of catching up with particle J. The slower particle Ts didn't stand a chance and were soon left to fizzle out, bereft of energy (and all hope).<br><br>The faster particle Ts not only managed to catch up with particle J, but often to fuse with them as well. The fusion was often a very quick affair, tho the energy produced was often of a quite unbelievable magnitude. (for those interested, the energy levels followed closely the formula E=mc2, where E = ecstasy, m = money, c = car and 2 indicates the number of seats in the car).<br><br>Occasionally, the fusion of particles T and J would result in the production of more particles (either T or J). It is at this moment that particle T appears to dislodge itself from particle J and take flight. The trajectory of particle T at this point in time can best be described by the Newtonian law of motion: a body in motion tends to stay in motion.<br><br>3. The Religio-Mythical Connection<br><br>On a more sombre note, a biblical perspective too can shed light on the connection between fast cars and women. In the very beginning, on this view, was Adam and Eve. Adam was tempted by the apple offered by Jane....erm, i mean, Eve....ate it and thus resulted in the fallenness of man. Adam had succumbed to temptation, committed a sin and was thus seen as having "fallen" in the eyes of God. As a consequence, all of mankind now exists in the shadow of the Fall.<br><br>In the same way that Adam had sinned, the sports car is a symbol of earthly possession and temptation, not unlike the detested apple. Adam's sin of being unable to resist temptation and of finally succumbing to it is an allegory for the desire, longing and chase for material possessions like the sports car. And the same way that Eve was by Adam's side when he bit into that apple, so too the connection between sports cars (temptation) and women (Eve).<br><br>So there....three perspectives on your query. There would appear to be a connection after all. I hope this helped you and maybe now you can rest easy and have a good night's sleep.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>cheers!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sex, pretty girls and cars. Well... I think everybody got em pretty mixed up. I agree with what others would say that sex sells (that probably explained the panty shoot and the gals with the car  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">). And I agree whole heartedly with Rinoa that a Ferrari would definitely turn heads, but why make use of girls (wearing sexily) to sell cars?<br><br>People buy cars for convience (correct spelling I hope) sake, the design, power of the car and the make and model. Unless u're a 'Chee-ko-peh' or a Sex Maniac who drives flashy cars around to induce gals to sleep with you, I don't think one should be buying cars because that beauty (dressing to kill)is advertising it.<br><br>Don't let your EYES rule your HEAD.
