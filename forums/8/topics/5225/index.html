I have heard enuff to take this sitting down... Maybe more gals should take a more serious effort into understanding guys rather than gossiping about useless stuff and complaining about how badly you are being treated...<br><br>I am not saying all guys are wonderful but i think that some of the guys are not getting the credit they deserve for the effort they put in...<br><br>You can say that we think with our dicks and we have to put up with it... suppose guys start to say you gals think with your boobs or whatever... guess what sort of reaction will the guy get...<br><br>[This message has been edited by zhongmin (edited 09-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Zhongmin,<br><br>that's just it. We girls don't understand you guys. And you guys don't understand us girls. That's why we always have conflicts.<br><br>Sometimes, I wonder if this is the way it is supposed to be. It'll be so creepy to find a guy who thinks and behaves exactly like a girl.<br><br>Besides , such conflicts can be 'good'.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah Purr, really terrifying to meet a guy who thinks like a gal. Dun think I wld wan a bf who think like me at all!<br><br>The wonders of a relationahip is the merging of souls between 2 different pple, each possessing their own thinking, personality and beliefs. I dun deny that some similarities are necessary, but the main thing is to be able to accept each other's character and not force any changes upon the other party so as to suit yurself.<br><br>As to the impressive speech 2 msgs above, well there may be some generalisations here, but then again, how can u deny the existence of this fact? Some (in fact, I think most) guys are seriously like that!<br><br>Back to the topic, how much do gals know abt guys? For me, I think I know enuff to make them come panting after me like mad dogs... Hey! Stop throwing those rotten tomatoes at me, wat's this? Stinking boots? Ok ok, I am joking, argh.. sorry guys!

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, i wonder why the author started this topic....Well, r u saying that women don't understand men?  If that ;s the case, i think<br>u shouldn't think of that.  From my past experience, i feel that both woman and guy are hard to understand.  Guys always always say that gals are hard to understand. Don't u think that guys are hard to udnersatnd too?<br>I find that gals are actually not that difficult to understand if u are senstive , caring and of course be more observing.  u will be able to break into their inner feeling .  As for guy, they also need gals to understand and care for them. Not all of guys are brave enough to tel  how they feel so it's the gals initiative at time to listen to them, empathy with them and of course...show your care if u really like them.  Just my two cents worth of idea.  Don't be mistaken.  I'm not supporting any man or women. Just a neutral party : - )</div>
