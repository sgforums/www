            <div class='col-md body'>Please be VERY sure you don't want to do it first. If not, it'll be easy for him to sway you. Just say, 'No, I'm not ready'. Repeat if necessary. Don't let him engage you in a long argument about what 'ready' means. Bound to be tiring and futile. Just say that you just don't FEEL ready and it's not something that can be defined. And it's not just about love but other societal pressures too. NEVER mention the possibility of break-up. Just say you are concerned about how your parents and society will look at you. If he cares about you, he should spare a thought for you.<br><br>If he ever uses the line, "If you love me, you'll do it" or "you don't love me if you reject me", turn the tables on him and say, "If you love me, you won't insist I do it now".<br><br>If he doesn't listen, you may want to reconsider your relationship.

I believe sparkle meant the hug as a reassurance to the guy that she treasures the relationship even though she is not willing to go to the extent of pre maritial sex. If guys are to take every hug as a signal to proceed all the way, then I think the guy is really ultra desperate.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the best answer is a straightforward to his face answer. If he can't take it, you two will probably have a tiff. He loves you enough, he will realize its his fault and come and apologize to you.

            <div class='col-md body'>I am getting the impression, from what has been written here, that guys are primarily interested in girls only because of sex, and that the reason behind it is due to a purely physical need.<br><br>I am not sure that is totally accurate. Not all guys are like that, definately. I believe that sex is sacred. It is not merely just a physical act; it is a union of souls, of two people, man and woman, who come together to express their love so closely that they become one.<br><br>Is this an old-fashioned or outdated point of view? No. It is precisely because the value of having sex has been cheapened to such a degree that it's only purpose is to fulfill one's physical desires that such problems occur. Problems where the guy wants to satisfy himself and gives all sorts of excuses to do so.<br><br>I am sure most girls understand this more than guys do. But it is not fair to say that on the matter of sex all guys just want to be satisfied only physically. We have emotions as well. If I made love with my wife, I would be careful to satisfy her emotional needs as much as her physical needs. Her happiness would be my happiness, for I am hers, and she is mine.<br><br>So the bottom line is, please do not cheapen the value of sex. Both sides should understand its seriousness, and the consequences that would result as well. Guys, we are not that weak. We can control ourselves if we want to. Do not make excuses. And please do not throw the 'what if the girl seduces me' scenario at me. If I were caught in such a situation, I would surely pack up and leave.<br><br>This is merely the path I have chosen. You decide yours.</div>

Girls luuuuurrrvvvveee to use this, in one form or another. Poor boy, I see it's worked on you (i.e. confused you). Even when the guy realises that she's pulled this one on him, he probably won't know how to handle it. How do you argue about feelings?

            <div class='col-md body'>I suggested in a previous post to tell ur bf what's bothering you (why u dun want to have sex with him), and after that give him a hug. This suggestion assumes that the guy really loves the girl, and giving him a hug after rejecting his request sort of will reassure him that u still love him. It's incredible that some people actually said this will make him want sex more, come on, sex urges can be controlled rite...it's just whether u want to or not...there's no such thing as "cannot control".<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As a guy, i will advise u that it is not advisable to hug ur bf when he is asking for sex. Most probably he will de chun jin chi.<br>He will think this way : hug= silence consent. so better dun hug him and dun stay in a quiet isolated place.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Speaking from a guy's point of view, i would agree that you should not give him a hug, or anything or be alone with him in the room.<br>Another very important thing is, NOT to let him do anything at all. He may try to kiss you, touch you, hug you, etc. But you must be forceful in stopping even these. Otherwise, there may come a point whereby you will completely lose yourself.</div>
