              <p>Ok story was like this. This evening, whole family go out for outing. Firstly go to Joo chiat complex to look around, for a high quality European carpet to replace the old Persian carpet in my house living room. <br><br>Then later eat dinner at some vegetarian restaurant around there, n then go to Geylang Serai, to one big store selling many snacks n foodstuffs. Then my mother wanna buy fruits like buah luku n roasted chestnuts. <br><br>So went to the red light district of geylang, waaa saw many chio chickens leh  . My dad parked his car n me n mum go n buy fruits at the fruit stalls. He wait inside the car n parked by a small alley near the fruit shop, n he not going down coz he had double parked.<br><br>Ok, to cut the farking long story short, while my mum choosing buah lukus n other fruits at the fruit stall, i went to my dad n asked him for money to buy lew lian, n he gave me a $50 note.<br><br>So i happily went to this durian stall (fruit stall n durian stall ish seperate), sell many lew lian, n got many ppl eating lew lian by the tables. i forgot the name of the stall but its near a small grass patch n near bus stop. <br><br>i saw some lew lian, n cheapest kind is 3 for $10. One young unker in his late 30s asked me want what durian. I said i want sweet one, coz dun like bitter one. He led me to the rack of ?? durians, huge durians siah. I asked one durian about how much, he said something like its by the kilo, have to weigh one then know the price, n $xx per kilo, its good durian...etc.<br><br>I somehow didn't really catch what he was saying, maybe i was engrossed by the beautiful durians or maybe his speech wasn't very clear coz he was blabbering about how good the durians were, bao jiak eh etc. So i say i take 2 lor, he open 2 n let me try both. hmmm, not bad. <br><br>So i go to the counter to pay, with $50 in my hand, he key in the cash register, $75. $75!!! ****, my dad gave me only $50, n i didn't expect the durians to be so exp.!! Damn it siah! 2 big durians = $75?? I asked him how come so expensive? <br><br>He say one kilogram $15, so the 2 durians i took total about 5 kg, so 5 * $15/kg = $75.<br><br>**** lah, i chose the durians too exp. liao. So i told him, my papa gave me $50 nia, so now i only wanna take one durian. He say cannot ah, i already tasted both the durians, i have to buy them both. ****, then since i m holding the $50 in my hand, he go n pull the $50 out of my hands sia!!! N then he put inside his cash register!!!<br><br>****, my $50 gone liao. n he said not enough money can go back take from ur father or pay by nets. Waa seh, durian seller got nets machine siah. I say please lah, i buy only one durian, can?? *pityful look*. He say cannot lah, he have to do business one, i already tasted the durian, n agreed, then now say dun want, like that how can???<br><br>So now i bo bian, he already take the $50 from me liao, i have to pay the balance lor, or else i have to walk away empty handed n with a loss of $50 coz he dun look very friendly n i dun think he will return me the money lor. He say give me discount of $5, so need to pay $20 more. <br><br>ok lor, so bo bian, i take out $20 n pay him, damn it! kenna conned liao. I should've asked him exactly how much one fruit cost before deciding whether to buy or not n tasting it. Ok maybe it was my fault for not clarifying how much per kilo n how much would one durian cost. <br><br>Never in my life have i bought such exp. durians. Normally buy those packaged in styrafoam packet like 1 pack $2, or 3 for $10, or 1 for $5 kind. Or those 3 for $10 durians or $5 D24 kind.<br><br>So i angrily carry the stupid spiky fruits back n dumped them into the car trunk, n they roll n roll n roll n ended up at the end of the trunk, machiam like bowling balls. oops, lol, coz the car has a huge n deep trunk. <br><br>Alamak, sure kenna scolded by lao peh, for buying such expensive durians. Coz i think he expect me to buy those normal kinda $5 or 3 for $10 durians. <br><br>Later we moved off, i told him 2 durians cost $70, u owe me $20. Then he chua tio, say how come so expensive one?? what kinda durian u buy? wah lau eh, u kenna con si boh???<br><br>i told him the whole story lor, n he scolded me for not paying attention when the durian man is talking, n finding out the exact price before deciding to buy. <br><br>Then my mum keep nagging at me, coz i let ppl con me, n keep asking why i dun ask how much exactly per durian before i decide whether to buy or not. She say those 3 for $10 or $5 type good liao lah, mai hiam jiak, buay pai jiak. (dun fussy eat, not bad to eat). She say $70 for 2 really outrageous. She say when the durian man recommend u durian, its sure those expensive type. u could;ve said dun want n go n buy those 3 for $10 type. N just becoz ur father give u money u go n anyhow spend. <br><br>Then mum keep nagging n nagging at me lor. ninabu-eh! make me dulan!!! <br><br>I say maybe $70 for 2 coz its a good quality durian? Then i say i didnt expect them to be so exp (i tot at the most $30 or $40 for both). n i said actually i refused but since he took my $50 what can i do? Walk away empty handed ah?<br><br>Then he say nevermind, he will go back n ask the durian man. n so he drive back to the durian stall n up his car on the pavement n i follow him there n he asked, n the man said those durians r $15 per kg, n the ones i chose are about 2.5 kg each. Then the durian man say your son agreed after tasting n so like that lor. He also say got even more exp. ones, the maoshanwang type, but he dared not recommend me. The $15/kg is the average type.<br><br>Then i saw the price sign on the durian table, but its pasted on the table ledge. I think just now when i wanna buy durian, the man go n stand n blocked the sign, so i didn't see the sign which says $15 per kilogram. N hor, i noticed the sign, the '1' write very small, while the '5' write very big. So from far look like $5, coz the '1' so tiny while the '5' very big.<br><br>My own fault lor, for not being alert. ****, next time dun buy those per kilo durian, buy those cheaper $5 each can liao.<br><br>Go home eat durian, not bad lah. Then i ask my dad pay me the $20 balance which i topped up, he pay me, haha lucky wor, or else i broke by $20 today.<br><br>Then also gave some durians to my maid, n my mum told her 2 durian $70, then she also got a shock, lol. <br><br><br>OK MORAL OF STORY - <br>1. always ask how much per kilo, n the durian u want is how many kilo, before u decide to buy a durian.<br><br>2. dun have to listen to the durian man's recommendation, coz he surely recommend u the exp. ones instead of those cheap 3 for $10 kind.<br><br>3. if u taste liao, u have to buy it lor. unless its a spoilt durian<br><br>4. dun hold ur money in ur hand.<br><br>5. just stick to buying 3 for $10 or $5 each durians if u not willing to buy those exotic durians. Some people say all durians taste about the same anyway, its just the branding in order to let the durian sellers earn more money. Ok, sure, those more exp. durians may have more flesh n smaller seeds, but if u r not fussy those cheaper kind will do just the same.<br><br>---Hey u know what, if u read until here, n read everything, i really appreciate ur patience n i thank u deeply. Cheers</p>
              <p>anyway i not the first person tio conned. here r others i found after doing a little search on google. now i realized. farking ccb</p>
