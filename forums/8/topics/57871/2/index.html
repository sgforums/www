            <div class='col-md body'>Too Career Minded<br><br>Romance? Who cares, say singles<br><br>A FEW snatched moments were all he had.<br><br>It was TV director Kat Goh's birthday, but her boyfriend had to wait until 1am the next day to present her with a cake and a gift. That was three years ago and she had worked all through her birthday.<br><br>They soon broke up. As in an earlier break-up, the 'other man' was her work.<br><br>Said Miss Goh, 30: 'I'm a workaholic. I'm happy when I work. If I don't work, I feel uncomfortable and restless.'<br><br>In fact, seven out of 10 singles aged 25 to 49 said they would dump a date for work.<br><br>A third of the singles surveyed this month by Singapore Press Holdings' research arm, say they've hardly dated in the past 12 months, or not dated at all.<br><br>Marketing executive Priscilla Boo, 27, who doesn't date much, says: 'My career is my priority. And if I need to cancel a date for work, I will.' She hopes to be married by 30, but in the same breath says: 'I don't have many chances to meet new people.'<br><br>Mr Melvin Liew, 29, a regional sales manager, says he travels every week to meet clients and attend seminars - a schedule that's scuttled many dates and relationships.<br><br>He recalled: 'My last girlfriend and I quarrelled about not having enough time for each other. But before we could resolve it, I had to fly off to Tokyo. That spelt the end of it.<br><br>'I'm on the road so much that it's very difficult to even meet new people, let alone date. And if I do have a date and work crops up, work takes precedence.'<br><br>And women are more likely than men to choose a liaison with the laptop over a rendezvous in a restaurant. While 66 per cent of the men would cancel a date for work; 72 per cent of the women would do it.<br><br>In the singles' scheme of things, you see, health, family and career are top priorities. Then come friends, leisure time and religion.<br><br>Marriage and children come last in the list of eight.<br><br>No wonder the singles count swells. In 2001, there were 1.02 million, up nearly 4 per cent from 1990.<br><br>Sociologist Alfred Choi thinks the findings reflect the new economic realities and pragmatic Singaporeans know they have to work harder to keep their jobs.<br><br>Sociologist Paulin Straughan suggests another explanation: 'The promotion or pay raise can come sooner than rewards from being a caring spouse.' And if your work is perceived to be poor, the result is also immediate - you can get fired.<br><br>'But many perceive incorrectly that the cost to personal relations - like missing a date - is minimal as you can always go out another day.'<br><br>The survey also found differences in priorities between age groups. Marriage and children ranked ahead of religion only for singles aged 25 to 39. For people in their 40s, marriage and children dropped to the bottom of the list.<br><br>Ms Cecilia Lim, 47, a systems analyst, said: 'I used to be uncomfortable in my 30s when friends asked me why I wasn't married. I'd wonder, 'What's wrong with me?'<br><br>'But I've learnt to be kinder to myself. I'm very happy now, with work and my nephews and nieces. If I marry, it's just a bonus.'<br><br>It is precisely this attitude that pro-family advocates dread.<br><br>Mr Chan Soo Sen, Minister of State (Community Development and Sports and Education), is disappointed but not surprised.<br><br>'We understand that Singaporeans want to build up their careers before settling down. But if they wait too long, it may be too late to find someone and to have children,' he said, adding that he's thankful he met his wife at university.<br><br>'When I started my career, I worked very hard to prove myself. I would have had no opportunity to find someone then,' he said.<br><br>Mr Chan, who heads the Family Matters! committee promoting family life, said it is working with the National University of Singapore to see how opportunities can be created for singles to meet before they begin their careers.<br><br>Dr Choi suggests that agencies such as the Social Development Unit (SDU) organise such events with other organisations, but keep their names out of it.<br><br>SDU director Tan-Huang Shuo Mei said candidly: 'Whether it's SDU or any other group by another name, if it's aimed at getting singles to meet, it's bound to meet with some resistance.'<br><br>So, the SDU is rolling out a new programme by the year's end to train married volunteers to match singles in their own social circles.<br><br>Dr Straughan believes that it needs more help. She argues for legislating family-friendly policies at the workplace, such as a five-day work week.<br><br>It may curb productivity in the short term, she concedes, 'but we must see these initiatives as long-term investment for the country. We have overtaken Japan as the world's fastest ageing nation - and it's not a bright future ahead.'<br><br>But she'll have a tough job convincing singles like Miss Goh, who said firmly: 'Really, I can't imagine marriage or having kids. I don't want to give up my work.'<br><br>http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/news/story/0,4386,211956,00.html?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

And a minority will think they are super Hiao.<br><br>The Ang Moh breed are quite open to certain topics BUT a whole lot of them think they dont come from Singapore.

Of course, a minority of them are conservative.<br><br>The moral of the story is;<br>The ang moh type can be too smart for me to handle. I prefer the real Singaporean Chinese but..... I speak lousy chinese!!<br><br>Just some thoughts of mine.  </strong><br><br>Yes the girls here are a blend of things, like most things are. There are those who are smart and speak english very well, there are those who are smart and mostly mother-tongued (not English speaking most of the time), then there are the rare-gangster club kind (Ah lians, i believe they are called). But i believe they all share one thing in common: "Fear of the foreigner", not wanting to mingle or mix with him/her, this is especially true for Eurasians/Caucasians I personally believe. These girls, and guys (but mostly girls) have this chip on their shoulder to always be in a clique of their own kind... but ofcourse not all girls are like that scientifically speaking, just 99% of the local girls I have met.<br><br><strong>But seriously, if they all stood in a row, and you looked at them from behind, they ARE the same, from their rebonded hair to their dressing</strong><br><br>I hope I am not racist, a friend and me were talking the other day, most Singaporean girls look good from the back until they turn their head, this is particularly true for women. But before I get slaughtered for that remark, let me say it is not true for all women, it was just something me friend and i were laughing lamely about, cos that has happened to us 96% of our limited lifespans here.<br>A third of the singles surveyed this month by Singapore Press Holdings' research arm, say they've hardly dated in the past 12 months, or not dated at all.<br><br><strong>Marketing executive Priscilla Boo, 27, who doesn't date much, says: 'My career is my priority.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>dont u guys find that..singapore people are growing shorter n shorter...</strong><br><br>On the contrary, they are growing taller.

It must be all the new nutritcious western food we are eating, and exercise ofcourse. TO avoid rebuttle, but then again Asian rice and dim sum is truly nutricious and delicious, in fact, studies have shown that potatoes and rice yield similar levels of carbos blah blah blah.</div>
