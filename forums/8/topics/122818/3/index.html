When people don't turn up for IPPT , instead of fining them , should not call them up just as often because they might be doing the national duty at home.<br><br>my two cents worth of thinking.<br>Now the government is resorting to import chinese nationals , seeing them everywhere, in buses , mrts , i think chinese nationals now form at least 3%-4% of our population.<br><br>Even traditional indians manage to preserve their values , and reproduce and teach them good values etc which they have since migrating here from India.<br>For the chinese , we can't even preserve our culture and values,<br>do you know that there are not only chinese new year which the chinese celebrate ?<br><br></div>
