Basically, the more children they bear, the higher the rebate.  This was to try to encourage these graduate couples to have more kids.<br><br>Why?<br><br>Simple.  Someone influential thought that if both parents were graduates, then, the kids they have would naturally be 'smarter'.  That sparked a huge debate on Nature vs Nurture.  A great many women were insulted then because was it insinuated that if the woman wasn't a graduate, then she shouldn't have too many kids and the kids that she will have won't be as intelligent as the kids of the graduate mom.<br><br>Is it any surprise that the SDU was created round about that period too?<br><br>Wake up... it WAS sinister!  The reason why he got away with implementing these ideas was because not too many people actually THOUGHT about it.<br><br>Wanna know what other comment he made then that sparked a HUGE outrage?

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay, I managed to find a relevant quote from the "Talent for the Future" segment of the 1983 National Day Rally speech.  Referring to the relative lack of children being produced by educated women, Mr Lee said:<br><br><blockquote>If we continue to reproduce ourselves in this lopsided way, we will be unable to maintain our present standards. Levels of competence will decline. Our economy will falter, the administration will suffer, and the society will decline. For how can we avoid lowering performance when for every two graduates (with some exaggeration to make the point), in 25 yearsÂ’ time there will be one graduate, and for every two educated workers, there will be three?</blockquote>One of the more alarming quotes (Heng &amp; Devan, 1992) from LKY was that the intelligent citizens of Singapore would be:<br><br><blockquote>increasingly swamped by a seething, proliferating mass of the unintelligent, untalented, and genetically inferior</blockquote>Also, if we were to examine the nature of SDU, the way things were structured in 1984 was as follows (Wong &amp; Yeoh, 2003):<br><br><blockquote>For highly-educated women who gave birth to three or more children, an enhanced tax relief and priority for primary school admission were introduced. The Social Development Unit was set up in 1984 to encourage love matches among graduates. <strong>To discourage lesser-educated women to have children, a sterilization incentive of $10,000 was given to women with no Â‘OÂ’ levels below the age of 30 to stop having children after their first or second child, with a penalty of the repayment of the same amount plus interest should they give birth to a third child.</strong> </blockquote>Encouraging educated women to have more kids is one thing, but having less-educated women sterilised is reminiscent of Germany in the 1930's.  I took SDU as a joke until I came across this.  Suddenly, it's not so funny any more.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">References</span><br><br>Heng, G., &amp; and Devan, J. (1992).

            <div class='col-md body'>The graduation women shall only marry graduates and non-graduates shall not have kids policy during the 1980s, at that time, did caused a big uproar. It was also a main reason for the "smallest" win ever for the PAP. *checks my political science notes* "In the 1984 Elections, PAP lost two seats to the opposition parties, which was significant as even though the PAP won the majority of the votes, the total votes against the PAP rose up to 37%"<br><br>And so, this policy was abolished. But today, they are doing things more subtle in their efforts and not so obvious in their open policies. For example, you're talking about Baby Bonuses and tax rebates etc. They're doing all the pushing under the table.<br><br>But seriously, do you consider SDU to be a very important and efficient organisation? How many of you out there got married through SDU? 1 or 2 years later, I'll be inside that place but unless there's really something interesting, I'll pass from their activities. In my opinion, yes, SDU's a joke, not a big one, since it's the truth nobody really cares about it nowadays.</div>
