Yes, HCJC did over take Raffles Junior College in year 2001 and 2002. But why? Have the public ever wondered? That was because a new principal, Mr Winston James Hodge, was being installed into the prestigious college. In the years of transition, Mr.Hodge had a really hard time balancing and bringing a holistic education for Rafflesians. But the year 2003 proved to Singapore that RJC is truly a magnificient junior college. Look at their recent grades! They are 'on-form' again! Just look at this:<br>********<br>Here is the ranking of schools[2003]:<br><br>1st. Raffles Junior College<br>2nd. Hwa Chong Junior College<br>3rd. Victoria Junior College<br>4th. National Junior College<br>5th. Temasek Junior College<br><br>[Percentage of 4A(s) among total school population in A'level 2003]<br><br>1) Raffles JC: 51.3% [* broke record in Singapore's A'level history by going past the 50% mark. RJC trashed HCJC hands down  ]<br>2) Hwa Chong JC: 41.8% [* Lost to RJC by 9.5% (approx. 10%) ]<br>3) Victoria JC: 30.6% [* Lost to HCJC by 11.2% (approx 10%)]<br>4) National JC: 20+% [* 20+% but exact figures unknown]<br>5) Temasek JC: 14.5%<br><br>[Number of students with 9As]<br>1) Raffles JC: 2 [Kwek Li Ern Joy &amp; Tan Shin Eik] [Trashed HCJC hands down]<br>2) Hwa Chong JC: Zero [What a shame! Even VJC has one!]<br>3) Victoria JC: 1 [Chen De Feng Clarence]<br>4) National JC: Zero<br>5) Temasek JC: Zero<br>********<br>2) One thing I would like to agree with the public is the general consensus that RJC's facilities really do suck. But... why bother? Why care more when RJC produces students that dominate the school of MEDICINE in NUS? (RJC alone produces over 100 doctors EVERY year). Why care more when RJC produces 3 out of 5 President Scholars last year(Btw, HCJC only produced 1, the other 1 is from ACJC). Why care more when most of the Public Service Commision scholarships went into Rafflesians' hands? Why care more when Cambridge University came to Singapore personally in hope to persuade more Rafflesians to value-add their college? Why care more when RJC is moving next to RI next year and will boost state-of-art facilities and architecture? Why care more when you work in other countries next time and the foreign boss laughs at your education history before exclaiming, "Hua Choong? What's that? Is it a city in China? The Chinese High School? I though Singapore was a multi-racial country?"<br><br>3) I would also like to point out the fact that a lot of people can make it to RJC, but chooses to go to HCJC. It's purely a matter of choice. So nothing to comment about that.<br><br>4) What RJC values is not discipline among students but instills the sense of freedom and self-awareness among their students. This is the clear distinction that makes them the 'elites'. Now you know why many of them get scholarships and are allowed to enter prestigious foreign universities. Haven't you heard about HCJC? One lecturer would starting rambling infront of the LT and two other teachers will patrol at the back of the hall, making sure no one is sleeping? Would you like to study in this environment that stifles creativity? Admit it, other than Annabelle Chong (acclaimed HCJC pornstar now in USA), HCJC has virtually NO talents in areas other than studying (So? Their result is still worse than RJC!)<br><br>5) RJC provides a holisitic approach to education, and shapes students into leaders, pioneers and thinkers. This is what a knowledge-based economy needs? Rafflesians are the pillars of our future!<br><br>6) I'm not a RJC student and too old to be in any JC anymore. But the students out there reading this... if you have the chance to jump into the RJC bandwagon, why hesitate? Who knows, you might be our next president.<br><br>Let us all be the hope for a better age.<br><br>Auspicium Melioris Aevi!</div></blockquote>haf u forgot to add: NTU? where's tat nanyang? china?<br><br>(btw, think ur statement oso devalues the chinese pple.)<br><br>onli rjc students got talents? oh, tat's something new...</div>
