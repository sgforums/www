I think there are many singles in this forum that are very happily enjoying their independence and freedom.<br><br>Rejection is no big deal - there are also lots of people you are not interested in. So what's so surprising that some people are not interested in you? It isn't easy AT ALL for two people who genuinely like each other to meet.<br><br>A lot of people find confident, interesting people attractive, regardless of how they look. That means you have your own interests, your own thinking, your own friends.<br><br>A person who looks good but is emotionally very dependent on his/her partner/have no confidence/self absorbed cannot be a good partner even if one may find them momentarily attractive.<br><br>So why just stick around at home every weekend? Get out and do something! Find something you enjoy doing and you will usually meet more people while enjoying yourself. This way, you might meet someone 'accidentally' while making your life fuller. At any rate, you will be leading a more interesting life than wasting time mourning about what's wrong with yourself.</div>
