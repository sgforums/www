              <p>The reason is being, apple itune in the internet needs a credit card to enter, apple iphone comes with no games, no songs, but all is in itune, it is not you need to pay, but in itunes you can both free and pay stuffs, without a credit card, you cannot surf itune ya. So, those telcos selling Iphone will insist that you have credit cards register first with them so that you can go into itune to surf.</p>
              <p>If you are buying a iphone over the counter without any contract, you can use cash if you dun have a credit card. But later when you want to surf itune, you will have problem, and your Iphone will be not be able to enjoy what apple truly offer you at a discount rate for any downloading.</p>
