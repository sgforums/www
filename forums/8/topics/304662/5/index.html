I found the family of five (thank God all four kittens survived and are healthy) huddled together in a small drain leading to my backyard (but blocked). I asked my mom to bring me a box and took the risk of the mother cat not wanting the kittens anymore after they have my smell... and put them into the box, then brought them into my backyard, cos i was really reluctant to let them stay out there like that.<br><br>then the mother cat followed lah.<br><br>at first she was unsettled and wanted to take her kittens elsewhere again. It took a great deal of effort before she could take up one kitten in her mouth. I tried to stop her by blocking her way hahahaha but it didn't work, so when she was preparing to jump up the low wall, i pulled her tail and didn't want to let her jump. But I cannot hold on to her forever lah so I just let her be.<br><br>After that she came back for the rest of the kittens, but i think she was prolly tired, so she ended up sitting down near the wall with the rest of the kittens, leaving one outside the backyard. I had to go out and carry it in again..<br><br>Now they're all in my backyard, but sleeping near the wall without any shelter.. I hope the cat moves the kittens further in, otherwise when it rains or is scorching hot ah.. aiyoh.<br><br>And also, hope she doesn't take them away again. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote>yah i am going to wash my face and go to sleep soon<br>i din have enough sleep last night too<br><br>wah the mother cat really so protective hor<br>these animals are just so amazing!!!<br><br>do you have a box big enough for the kittens + the mother cat<br>like... put them all together?<br><br>goodnight fipig</div>

It's so heart-wrenching to see my dog having a needle stuck into her small leg. TWICE at that. And each time they do it, they pull the syringe and push it back again multiple times, leaving a lot of empty space in the syringe, like that:<br><br><img src="http://i25.tinypic.com/2pslwux.png"><br><br>But the last time I went, it was another guy who did the drawing of blood. He was swift, managed to draw enough blood from just one leg, without leaving spaces in the syringe. He commented my dog had very small blood vessels but still he was able to do such a good job! Usually when the people at the clinic draw blood from my dog, one person holds the dog down while the other takes the blood sample. But this guy did it all by himself..<br><br>After this incident, I think after my dog's liver improves, I seriously should start looking for another vet. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> we only go to Mt Pleasant cos it's nearby.<br><br>Dr Thiru ah.. *makes mental note* will consider... a bit far though ... but will consider.</div>
