Then the victim keep winning, the gun man not happy, then they stop playing mahjong, they play poker instead...

A 41-year-old businessman who resided in the flat, was found bleeding and lying face down on the floor in the study room. He was pronounced dead at the scene at 7.50am<br><br>Earlier at about 6.55 am , a man had entered the flat armed with a gun. The victim's wife, teenaged daughter and maid were tied up and the house was ransacked. A few shots were heard and the victim was fatally wounded. The victimÂ’s wife, daughter and maid were unhurt. The man then ran out of the door towards an unknown direction.<br><br>Police are currently on the look out for the suspect. [b]He is believed to be Chinese in his late 30s to 40s, and is described as plump built, about 1.7 m tall. He is wearing a black round-neck T-shirt with some wordings, black pants and black shoes. He was also sporting a black cap and appeared to be blind in his right eye. He fled the house carrying a blue-coloured denim handbag which is believed to contain cash and jewellery taken from the house. </strong><br>Members of the public who spot anyone fitting the description of the suspect are advised to call the Police immediately. <strong>They should not approach the suspect as he may be dangerous.</strong><br>[/b]</blockquote>shot once in the head and five in the body<br><br>exactly the same way the T-800 killed all the Conners in the first terminator movie.....</div>
