            <div class='col-md body'>Yo bismarck! Your swordfish suffering from dropsy. You can see from the photo that the fish's scales are raised. This is a symptom of dropsy. It is a infectious disease caused by bacterial infection. Largely due to poor water condition. You should go add some liquid medications to avoid spreading the infection to your other fish, and you have to change water and clean up the pump liaoz. And throw away the carbon from the pump! The only purpose for the carbon is to keep the water crystal clear, but you have to change the carbon often, cause i can bet you the source of the bacterial infection is from the carbon. I learnt the hard way b4, now i dun use carbon at all, i use those cotten wool instead, and change it when it gets disgusting. Finally, if you think your situation is too jialat liaoz, and the meds not working, you should do the old fashion way and add salt. Cover the tank when you do this hor, the fish, expecially swordfish tend to jump when salt is added.<br><br>Hopefully this helps!

            <div class='col-md body'>harlow! hmmz....i guess the fish u described are on their way to fish heaven liaoz. Their condition too jialat to be saved. Usually, when i see these sort of cannot make it symptoms, i will remove the fish and put them in a tank so they can die in peace and not infect the tank further. Well, i guess the dying fish will all be stuck at the pump mah, too weak to move. BUt sorry manz, i think u did all u can liaoz. u changed water, put salt, its up to the fish liaoz. If they can survive, than they can survive, if not, than dazzit liaoz. Also, about the fins missing, do u have sucker-catfish in the tank? It might be them chewing the fins off the dead, or other healthier swordfish practising a bit of cannibalism. If not by other fish, than it would be a case of fin rot, but i should think its not fin rot lar, cos u added salt already.<br>This sort of bacterial infection is the most jialat, next to fungus, happened to me a few times liaoz, whole tank can just gone case in a few days. i have a routine when this sort of thing happens. Change 1/2 the tank's water, add medication, dun feed for 3 days, than if still cannot make it, i again change 1/2 the tank's water and add salt, again, dun feed until i see some sort of improvement. Anyways, so sorry for the grim msg, but dun be disheartened!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Good Luck!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh yar bismark! You can do one final thing, you can buy a heater and raise the tank temp. to around 26-27 celsius. Since fish are cold blooded, the higher temp. will increase fish metabolic rate, boost immune system blah blah blah. And if you really want to help those fish that i said is cannot make it, u can give them a salt bath. THis means that u prepare a pail of water, put LOTS of salt in it, put the fish in for about 10 seconds....the fish will be very uncomfatable, and will find hard to breathe in this salt water and will struggle and jump. But the salt bath will also almost definately kill the bacteria, IF the fish is not too weak. But only use the salt bath if you are VERY desperate, i only do this if the fish is very important to me, or cost damn a lot. And this method is not 100%, the fish can die from stress by being in the salt bath. Salt baths especially good for fungal and external parasite infections.</div>
