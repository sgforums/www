We really wish we were making that up for, you know, dramatic effect because goddamn, what a terrible thing a three-inch acid-shooting hornet would be, you know? Oh, hey, did we mention it shoots it into your eyes? Or that the poison also has a pheromone co<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>cktail in it that'll call every hornet in the hive to come over and sting you until you are no longer alive?<br><br>Think you can outrun it? It can fly 50 miles in a day. It'd be nice to say something reassuring at this point, like "Don't worry, they only live on top of really tall mountains where nobody wants to live," but no, they live all over the goddamned place, including outside Tokyo.<br><br>Forty people die like that every year, each of them horribly.<br><br><img src="http://cdn-www.cracked.com/articleimages/wong/gianthornet3.jpg"><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>More scary sh<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>it:</strong> </span><br>Here's how the Japanese hornet treats other insects (and would presumably treat us, if we were small enough). An adult hornet will fly miles to find some squishy sh<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>it to feed to its children. Often times, it finds its food in, say, a hive inhabited by thousands of bees.<br><br>What to do? Well, Vespa japonica sprays the nest with some of the acid/pheromone and brings in reinforcements, usually consisting of 30 or so fellow hornets. They then descend upon the beehive like an unholy plague of hell-born death engines and proceed to make this world a scary goddamned place. This is maybe 30 wasps against 30,000 bees and the 30,000 bees do not stand a chance.<br><br><strong>Video Clip =&gt; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fTrSOFyfxs" rel="nofollow">Japanese Giant Hornet (Hardcore Insect Violence)</a></strong><br><br>Behold the hornets systematically seize them with huge, wicked jaws and literally fu<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>cking cut them apart, one by one by one by fuc<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>king one.

Before it does this, it shrieks at you. This ant, you see, can shriek.<br><br>It's called a Bullet Ant because its 'unusually severe' sting feels like getting shot.

You can't. There is no physical way to determine the difference between an Africanized bee and a common European bee.<br><br>None whatsoever.<br><br>You can, however, easily tell the difference based on their behavior. Regular bees will give you about nine seconds of being too close to the hive before deciding you're a threat and then attacking you. So it's pretty easy to just walk past them without any screams. And if you do get them after you, they'll consider you to be 'chased off' after about 300 feet.<br><br><img src="http://cdn-www.cracked.com/articleimages/wong/africanized2.jpg"><br><br>Africanized bees do not roll this way. They give you half a second of being too close before they decide it is time to completely fu<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>ck your shi<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>t up and empty the entire hive--tens, maybe hundreds of thousands of angry, angry bees.

There's other subfamilies living in Asia and Africa, but these are the most notorious.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Why you must fear it: </span></strong><br>By now, you will not be surprised to hear that these ants are, in fact, fu<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>cking huge, with the soldiers reaching a half inch in length. You will also not be surprised to learn that they have massive, powerful, machete-like jaws half the length of the soldiers themselves. They're notorious for dismantling any living thing in their path, regardless of size. They're also completely blind, which for some reason makes the whole thing worse.<br><br><img src="http://cdn-www.cracked.com/articleimages/wong/armyant2.jpg"><br><br>They're called 'Army' ants because their entire colony, comprising up to and over one million insects, is a 100 percent mobile battalion. They don't make permanent hives like other ants, no, they bivouac down in single locations just long enough for the queen to sh<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>it out thousands of eggs, while the soldiers spread out in wide fans daily in search of food ("food" here, means "anything moving"<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>). Then the eggs hatch and they enter the dreaded swarm phase of their existence.<br><br><img src="http://cdn-www.cracked.com/articleimages/wong/armyant3.jpg"><br><br>Much like the word "killer," nature takes words like "dreaded" and "swarm" very, very seriously. They carefully pick up their larvae and go on the move, a near-solid mass of insect death and horror moving steadily and swiftly along the jungle floor, flaying alive and disassembling every living thing too stupid, slow or asleep to get the living fu<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>ck out of the way. There is no talk of painful stingers or ballistic acid here, no, this is terror of a far more primordial nature--the kind that simply flows over you by the hundreds of thousands and rips you apart with massive, unbelievably powerful jaws, utterly and literally blind to size and species, considering everything in their path to be a threat to the continuation of their colony.<br><br>There are reports of animals the size of horses being overwhelmed and shredded by them. Go stand next to a horse and then think about what that means for you.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>More scary sh<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>it:</strong></span><br>Army Ants are masters of wholly-organic, living architecture. For the good of the colony, the ants will use their own living bodies to build any conceivable structure necessary, latching on to each other foot-to-foot to create protective walls and ceilings against the ravages of the weather, bridges to cross otherwise impassable spans, whatever happens to be needed. (Can they form themselves into a crude catapult mechanism and launch themselves at prey? Not yet.)<br><br>There is no other living thing in the entire world that does this.<br><br>And, they're blind.<br><br>Now, time for the disclaimer. If you are squeamish or have a weak stomach or value your sanity in any way, you may want to bail out now.<br><br>Okay, here goes...<br><br></div>

Where they meet up and dig honeycombs into the horse's stomach. And get fat. When they're ready to be flies, they just let go and get pooped out of the system.<br><br>The Human Bot Fly lays its eggs on a horsefly or a mosquito, something that will attempt to land on a human.

Well, Vespa japonica sprays the nest with some of the acid/pheromone and brings in reinforcements, usually consisting of 30 or so fellow hornets. They then descend upon the beehive like an unholy plague of hell-born death engines and proceed to make this world a scary goddamned place.
