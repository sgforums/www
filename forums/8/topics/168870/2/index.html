            <div class='col-md body'>aiyah...  got give and take lah...<br><br>having stayed in a few cities around the world in my life....  there is no perfect city....<br><br>but i would say singapore will be one of the better ones...  with a few things they could improve.<br><br>places like in North America, you talk about democracy, how government takes care of you...   after living a few years there... you can see how fragile their government is.<br><br>I am not going to be specific....    the government pays for all your medical needs. but the cost of it???  you pay damn high taxes. so if you are not sick, you still pay for other's, and what's you are paying is for people with terminal/chronic illnesses.<br><br>then after few years, they realised they cannot come up with enough $$$. so the result???  your health benefits entitlement was reduced, targeting the age group  who would use the health system least.<br><br>So this targets people in the 18-50 age group. THE VERY people who are taxed to sustain the health system have their own health benefits reduced.<br><br>So the moral of my story is... look at the overall picture.<br><br>To you singapore can be better than LA, but i can tell you a few things LA is better....<br><br>1. Singapore does not aggressively push for environmental friendly vehicles.<br>2. Free Health care in CA. (see above)<br>3. talk bad about govt in sgp and see the consequence, do that in LA, nothing happens.<br><br>and the list continues...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by caramon.:</div><div class="quote_body">How bad is LA? Lets start from the Airport.... Once I get to the airport, I usually need to get a cab. Unlike Singapore where the pubic transport is excellent, people in LA have to drive themselves around - terrible. On my first trip, I went to the airport information counter and ask them how to get to the city - they said the best way is to rent a car.<br><br>When I said I can't drive, the jaw of the guy at the help desk drop - he has never seen an adult my age who can't drive in LA - everyone drives, including teenagers - I was told. In LA, every single taxi I took was driven by a foreigner or new immigrant - some were Nigerian or Russian.<br><br>In Singapore, every taxi is driven by a Singaporean. The job of driving taxi is seen as a step forward in life. In Singapore, you may be a bank manager but end up as a taxi driver once you get retrenched.<br><br>They really need Comfort to teach them how to turn their taxi drivers into money making machines. I always book a hotel near a bus stop with a DASH service - US$0.25 cents per ride - flat fee + free transfer. I heard the bus company is making a lost. They should really learn from Singapore bus companies on how to turn it into profit.<br><br>Whenever I'm there, I usually visit my friends who have emigrated there. I take the opportunity to tell them what they are missing in Singapore - good govt and all the recent accomplishment of the PAP govt. They usually complain to me about how difficult life is in LA - how hard it is to decide which car to buy at US$21,000.<br><br>One of them has a hard time washing his big Lexus - I really sympathise with him. His house at St. Gabriel area is also very big with a garden, very troublesome to clean compared to the 3 room flat that he was living in Singapore previously. I've tried many times to persuade him to return to Singapore but he was just too stubborn to listen to all my reasoning. Imagining living in a state where the governor is a former champion bodybuilder and Hollywood actor - how to sleep well at night with this kind of people running the government?<br><br>The only good part about LA is its proximity to Las Vegas. There are free bus offering day trips + free meals usually to the lesser known casinos. I would take this bus together with some of the residents from Chinatown. They seem to enjoy it because I keep seeing the same faces.<br><br>Although those day tours are free, the day trippers usually end up losing more than a few hundred bucks. I'm so glad the govt of Singapore is bringing the best of America - which is the casino- to Singapore - hope they also give free meals and drinks.....and hours of enjoyment for retirees to spend their retirement money.</div></blockquote>PAP suck lah....dont vote for them next time</div>
