            <div class='col-md body'>Personally don't have good impression of China people too. Been there before. Rudeness and about those scamming cases seem to be more prevalent in the city areas instead. I guess they really do everything they could to earn that extra bucks. I guess this is more of a cultural issue. I used to read up somewhere that chinese are pretty superstitious about helping people because they believe that it'll bring troubles upon themselves. I'm not too sure if this superstition really exist since I myself am a chinese (abeit Singaporean Chinese) but I don't seemed to remember something like that.<br><br>After Chairman Mao came into power, seemed that he expects courtesy from the people as a mean to encourages foreigners to commence trade/relationship building. That's when things started to change a bit.<br><br>Can't actually quote the sources from anywhere, since it's based on memory. But anyway, the bottomline is that opinions can differ due to cultural influences. For all you know, picking up a coin for them is more like a nosey act. Or perhaps, they have some grudges with us foreigners cos we so-called stole their jobs when we go over to their country, just the same as how we Singaporeans would think when foreigners come over Singapore, being highly paid and in high position.<br><br>Actually did met some really polite people over there. Don't quite remember the province, but it's home to some Buddhist ground. They got a  monastry-operated inn there too, where they hire ordinary people (not monks) to run the inn. Remarkable. Would love to go there again. That too, is influence, through religion.</div>
