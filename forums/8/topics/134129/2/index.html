By the time I got onto the bus and sank myself down to a seat, I was utterly exhausted from the gruelling queuing, not to mention the long walk I had before reaching the bus interchange.<br><br>I had barely warm my seat when this lady board the bus with two young kids.

Which is something more Singaporeans should understand.<br><br>But what happened next was terrible. An aged couple boarded the bus at the next stop. They are really old and was kinda feeble if you get what I mean. But after witnessing me giving up my seat for the lady, the other people on the bus did not bother to even acknowledge the old couple !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>I mean my act should have set a precedent and let the others follow as a good example.
