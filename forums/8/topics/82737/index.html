            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Take out a globe or other map of the world.  Take five words:  terrorism, tyranny, torture, revolution and war. Then place a small dot on every nation or region where one or more of these things is taking place.  Then take a dot of another color, and place it on each nation with nuclear capabilities or allied with a nuclear power from which they could obtain nuclear weapons.  It is then possible to come to the conclusion that if any nation can obtain nuclear weapons, they can also obtain chemical or biological weapons.<br><br>Locate every nation on earth which has been the victim of one or more types of terrorism.  The US had the World Trade Center/Pentagon attacks of Nine Eleven. Spain had its train bombing. Japan has had its subway attacks. France has had several incidents. Search the news sites and locate acts of terrorism from Indonesia to the Philippines  to Spain to the USA, and do not omit air disasters. Do not forget the continuing conflicts between India and Pakistan.  Place a dot of another color on these areas.<br><br>Now get a third color sticky-dot and label it "pestilences" and put it on every nation known to have a significant AIDS-infected population, ebola virus, West Nile virus, SARS and other killer diseases.<br><br>Now name the wars/killer conflicts associated with religious beliefs.  You will find Islam is at war with the entire non-Islamic world and some Islamic nations that have become too "westernized" for the radical arm of Islam. The ongoing war between Muslims and Hindus in India takes many lives but attracts little attention even though both are nuclear powers.  Iran, once Persia, home to various civilizations and empires over the past several thousand years, advanced in art, science and mathematics a thousand years ago, is now under the control of Islamic "fundamentalists" who possess western technology and medieval culture.<br><br>How many of the terrorist conflicts are associated with Islam as opposed to the Irish Republican Army or any similar group?<br><br>How many of these conflicts have involved inhumane practices such as beheadings, torture, and egregious conduct toward prisoners of "war" in the conflicts.  (Do not overlook South American revolutions, it is easy to do because of their lack of publicity, but start with Cuba and work south.)<br><br>Now note how effective every form of "appeasement" has been toward any enemy that has as its agenda the overthrow of the present government regardless of concessions offered or overtures for peace.  Hardly any. The terms of the conflict in the Middle East toward all western or pro-Israel nations is the same as it is with the Irish conflict over northern Ireland:  Get out or we will kill you.  That has been going on in the Middle East for thousands of years, far less than in Ireland, but people are dying in each case from war-inflicted wounds. How many African tribes have attempted genocide, either of other African tribes or of white settlers.<br><br>This is a depressing task, but if one will do the exercise thoroughly, they will come to the conclusion that in spite of no declaration of war, the entire world is involved in war, if not their own then someone else's.<br><br>People will find some excuse to fight.  It appears that for six thousand years of recorded history, most people have been oppressed, lifespans have generally been quite short, suffering has been universal, disease has been widespread and still is, leaping from one form or mutation to another in the face of antibiotics, and spawning more sexually-transmitted diseases than ever.<br><br>America, claiming some "moral high ground" that places it above genocide, aghast at torture and abuse, has no qualms about murdering several million unborn babies each year by legalized abortion. It mocks the God of its forefathers and the Bible on which its officials and leaders take oaths.  It supports and even promotes homosexuality, an abomination in both the Jewish Tanakh and the Christian Bible.  Child molesters multiply until one has to wonder when pedophilia will no longer be a crime in America.<br><br>We are going about telling the world how to live in a "democracy" when our nation is a federal republic.  We are going about helping "underprivileged" nations form constitutions when we do not follow our own.  We are meddling in the affairs of other nations that could ignite a holocaust war and assuring ourselves we do well by our planetary neighbors.  That is twenty-four carat hubris.<br><br>And while Americans parade their shame or display their dirty laundry in public, China quietly moves into strategic places, because they do not claim any moral superiority or national conscience, just the supremacy of the state.  And it has no regrets or apologies about killing Christians, their own or anyone else's. They will have no problem killing Islamics either if they prove to be a nuisance to the state.<br><br>On the whole, it appears that people simply do not like one another and never will.  Just because one is another human being is no reason to like or even respect them, says history.  Quite the opposite, history has seen human hatred reach "critical mass" before and it brought quite a rainstorm upon the earth.  We are informed that the next one will be a firestorm, and there is no indication that the fire isn't caused by human action, but under divine direction, as judgment.<br><br>Early Christianity caught on so quickly because of the brotherly love it teaches.  It is a faith that proclaims God's  love and terms for peace.  God is not responsible for the conduct of people who claim His Name but do not follow His commands.<br><br>Right now, with the world in self-destruct mode and smothering in various forms of hatred, it would appear that our species is soon to put itself out of existence.  Forty years ago, I would have agreed with that, had I seen today's news.  But some thirty years ago I entered into the Christian faith, and while much of the world may indeed destroy itself, that is no reason to lose hope in God's eternal promises for His elect.  That is the only reason I can look at the news day by day and not retreat into some garden club or crochet circle.  Ignorance isn't bliss, but it is easier on the blood pressure.<br><br>Indeed we do live in interesting times.  What comes tomorrow, if tomorrow comes?<br></div>

Two of the leading schools, Comfort Driving Centre and Singapore Safety Driving Centre (SSDC), have already budgeted for a fleet of automatic vehicles, trained their instructors, and come up with new curricula.<br><br>But some are cautious, saying such news might cause would-be students to postpone signing up for courses until next year.<br><br>Comfort Driving Centre said it was waiting for an official announcement on the start date, but added that it had already made plans for 20 automatic cars.<br><br>'Certificates of entitlement have already been secured... all our instructors have already been trained, and we are operationally ready,' said Ms Tammy Tan, spokesman for ComfortDelGro Corp, the transport giant that owns Comfort Driving Centre.<br><br>Mr Stephen Kong, SSDC's senior marketing executive, said his company has also prepared to buy 12 automatic cars. It currently has 117 cars, including two automatic ones.<br><br>'We're bidding for COEs for the 12 1.6-litre Honda Civics,' he said.<br><br>'We will progressively increase the fleet with demand.'<br><br>And there is demand. According to Mr Kong, the school has been getting daily enquiries from the public about automatic tests. 'On our website alone, we get more than 20 queries per week,' he said.<br><br>Going by the example in Japan, Mr Kong said demand will be strongest from women learners. About 48 per cent of SSDC's students are female.<br><br>But Comfort, which has conducted polls on the popularity of automatic testing, found only 23 per cent of its students would opt for it. Its surveys found most people were less keen when they were told that they would not be able to drive a manual car if they obtained a licence through an automatic test.<br><br>There is a bright side: a shorter training course. SSDC indicated that the automatic syllabus is slightly shorter than the manual one, but will focus on unique skills such as starting and moving off. The syllabus will need the approval of the Traffic Police.<br><br>When asked, the Traffic Police would only say that offering tests using automatic cars was 'a logical next step'.<br><br>'Such forms of testing is available in other countries. The public too has sought to have such testing choices made available here in Singapore,' said spokesman Phillip Mah.<br><br>He said the Traffic Police was in the final stages of a review and details of the change will be announced 'in a few months'.<br></div>
