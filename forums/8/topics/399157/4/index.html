              <p><br> If i am not wrong, according to my grandma here, she told me, last
              time singapore radio or what reddifussion channel also got
              newsreader and story tellers reading chinese text and speak out
              dialect, nice pure dialect, like Hokkien, teochew, cantonese, Hakka
              etc etc...therefore, my grandma said, actually all these are not
              dialects, but the govt make it or call it as dialects because
              they dun want to have gang and a separated society like teochew
              clan, hokkien clan and so on, she miss those years of listening to
              those story tellers..and i really feel pity for my young
              singaporean friends who are deprive of their original culture and a
              total lost of identity.</p>

              <p>yup you are right</p>
              <p>Strictly speaking, Chinese dialects are too divergent too be called dialects.</p>
              <p>They are full-flegded languages on their separate entity.</p>
              <p>It is downgraded to the status of "dialects" due to politicization.</p>

In view that the Speak Mandarin compaign was already a success, why can't we allow dialect drama serials or movies to be telecast on TV or at cinemas, and allow radio stations to play dialect songs?</p>

              <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: 12px; margin: 0px;">Dear Feedback Contributor</p>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: 12px; margin: 0px;">1.  We refer to your feedback on providing more dialect programmes.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: 12px; margin: 0px;">2.  Although the Speak Mandarin Campaign has achieved a certain degree of success, the dilemma over the issue of dialect has not abated, as many of our school-going children still have difficulty coping with two languages and mastering them effectively. Faced with the competition from rising English usage, the problem of falling Chinese standards among young Chinese Singaporeans will be exacerbated if the profile of dialects in the media were raised, as the addition of another competing language will unwittingly decrease Mandarin usage further, or encourage sub-standard Mandarin, mixed with dialect. It is for this reason that Singapore has adopted the policy of limiting the exposure of dialects in the media, as it would be difficult to arrest the decline of Mandarin once it sets in.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: 12px; margin: 0px;">3.  Therefore, while there is some leeway for dialect content to cater to niche audiences, especially the elderly, MDA's language guidelines for TV and radio support the Speak Mandarin policy. Currently, on free-to-air TV, Channel 8 currently broadcasts dialect operas and OKTO enjoys leeway to show arthouse movies with some dialect if the films have artistic merit. Dialect news bulletins are available on MediaCorp Radio's Capital 95.8FM.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: 12px; margin: 0px;">4.  For more dialect programmes, viewers can choose from subscription TV services like SCV or SingTel's MioTV. Channels like TVBJ on SCV and Mei Ah Channel on MioTV offer dialect programmes, while some dialect songs are available on music channels offered by these pay TV operators. Programmes in dialect are also offered on Video On Demand (VOD) services by SCV and MioTV. As for radio programmes, dialect radio programmes can be found on Rediffusion's subscription radio service.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: 12px; margin: 0px;">5.  As for dialect films, those with artistic merit are allowed for limited screening on a case-by-case basis at film festivals or film society screenings.  In addition, films with some dialect content are allowed for theatrical release.  Examples include 'Ah Long Pte Ltd' , '881', 'The Accidental Spy' (starring Jackie Chan) and 'Kungfu Dunk'.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: 12px; margin: 0px;">6.  There is no restriction on dialect content in DVDs and VCDs for commercial release.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: 12px; margin: 0px;">7.  We thank you for your feedback.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">A significant category of Chinese, although one not listed in the census reports, were the Baba Chinese or Straits Chinese. They were Chinese who after long residence in Southeast Asia spoke Malay or English as their first language, and whose culture contained elements from China, Southeast Asia, and sometimes Europe as well. An indication of the size of the Baba Chinese community was provided by the 1980 census report that 9 percent of Chinese families spoke English at home. Stereotypically the Baba were the offspring of Chinese migrants and local women. In the nineteenth century, they tended to be wealthier and better educated than the mass of immigrants and to identify more with Singapore and Southeast Asia than with China. In spite of their language, the Baba considered themselves Chinese, retained Chinese kinship patterns and religion, and even when speaking Malay used a distinct Baba dialect of Malay with many loan words from Hokkien.</span></p>

              <p>The very idea of "neutral" language sounds like a PAP propaganda bullshit to me.</p>
              <p>Which other countries got this type of rubbish concept as "neutral" language?</p>
              <p>The entire thing is a political ploy used by PAP to serve their own narrow interests.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">In colonial Singapore, the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">nearest thing to a common language had been Bazaar Malay</span></span></strong>, a form of Malay with simplified grammar and a very restricted vocabulary that members of many ethnic groups used to communicate in the marketplace. The government used English, with translators employed when necessary, as in the courts. Among the Chinese a simplified form of Hokkien served as the language of the marketplace. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">The Chinese schools, which were founded in large numbers in the early years of the twentieth century and associated with the rise of Chinese nationalism, attempted to teach in Mandarin Guoyu, the use of which on such formal occasions as weddings and Chinese national holiday celebrations came to carry some prestige. In the terminology of sociolinguistics, Singapore's language system was multilingual and diglossiac, that is, characterized by two languages or dialects, high and low, or classical and vernacular, each used in different social contexts and carrying differential prestige. Bazaar Malay and market Hokkien were the low languages, employed in the streets and market places, and English and Mandarin were the high languages, used in education, government offices, and public celebrations. In addition, such native tongues as pure Malay, Teochiu, Tamil, or Punjabi were used in the home and in gatherings of members of the same speech group.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"> In a 1972 survey asking which language people understood, Hokkien came first, at 73 percent, followed by Malay, with 57 percent. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Malay was the most important language for intergroup communication, with almost all the Indians and 45 percent of the Chinese claiming to understand it. </span></span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">English came second</span></span></strong>, understood by 47 percent of the total population.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"> A follow-up survey in 1978 showed that 67 percent claimed to understand Malay and 62 percent to comprehend English. As the 1990s approached <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">English was replacing Malay as the common language.</span></span></strong></span></p>

              <p>English as neutral language? Doesn't make sense to me. English is language of colonial elites and colonial masters.</p>
              <p>Colonial language is politically "neutral" language? I think if you use a colonial language means you still kowtow to those colonial elites. The mindset is still in colonial days.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">A significant category of Chinese, although one not listed in the census reports, were the Baba Chinese or Straits Chinese. They were Chinese who after long residence in Southeast Asia spoke Malay or English as their first language, and whose culture contained elements from China, Southeast Asia, and sometimes Europe as well. An indication of the size of the Baba Chinese community was provided by the 1980 census report that 9 percent of Chinese families spoke English at home. Stereotypically the Baba were the offspring of Chinese migrants and local women. In the nineteenth century, they tended to be wealthier and better educated than the mass of immigrants and to identify more with Singapore and Southeast Asia than with China. In spite of their language, the Baba considered themselves Chinese, retained Chinese kinship patterns and religion, and even when speaking Malay used a distinct Baba dialect of Malay with many loan words from Hokkien.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Never a large proportion of Singapore's Chinese population, in the late nineteenth century they took advantage of opportunities for education in English and promoted themselves as loyal to Britain.</span></span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">In Singapore, many Baba families spoke English as a first language and produced many of the leaders of Singapore's independent political movements, including Lee Kuan Yew...</span></p>

              <p>To ease the killing of something, first give it a label.
              Something that is not a popular label. Like labeling a language as
              a dialect.</p>
              <p>It easier to kill a Hokkien dialect than to kill the Hokkien
              language.</p>
              <p>China a multi-racial country. The people are able to speak their
              ethnic language plus Mandarin.</p>
              <p>The same should be for Singapore.</p>
              <p>People should be able to speak their ethnic language plus
              English.</p>
              <p>But the Singapore government wants the "Chinese" to speak
              English plus Mandarin only. When in fact the Chinese here should be
              able to speak English, Mandarin and their ethnic language
              i.e.  to be tri-lingual. But someone decreed that
              that would be too great a task for the 
              Chinese school children here, who are already highly stressed
              with the normal school curriculum. So the "dialect " should be
              killed to ease the promotion of Mandarin.</p>
              <p>As for the analogy of the French not able to speak
              French.</p>
              <p><em>According to Article 2 of the Constitution, amended in 1992,
              French is the sole official language of France. Therefore, France
              is the only Western European nation (excluding</em> <a title="European microstates" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/European_microstates"><span style="color: #0645ad;"><em>microstates</em></span></a><em>) to have only
              one officially recognised language. However, 77</em> <a title="Languages of France" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Languages_of_France"><span style="color: #0645ad;"><em>regional
              languages</em></span></a> <em>are also spoken, in metropolitan
              France as well as in the overseas departments and territories.
              Until recently, the French government and state school system
              discouraged the use of any of these languages, but they are now
              taught to varying degrees at some schools.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="#cite_note-88"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>89<span>]</span></span></a></sup> Other languages, such as Portuguese, Italian,</em> <a title="Maghrebi Arabic" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Maghrebi_Arabic"><span style="color: #0645ad;"><em>Maghrebi

              <p>it's a sad thing but a fact :</p>
              <p>although many Chinese in China (when asked by me) says that
              "Yes, we still pretty much speak dialects back at home - China"</p>
              <p>it is observed through scholarly studies by linguists that
              certain number of major dialects in China <span style="text-decoration: underline;">are also in the process of
              dying</span>, by way of erosion of Standard Mandarin vocabulary and
              changes in phonology by way of Mandarin influence</p>
              <p>usual man-on-the-street won't notice this change, that's why
              they still claim dialects are very pretty much alive</p>
              <p>some examples:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>i asked a Fuzhou young girl before (6 years ago), she told me
              roughly 30%-40% of her vocab with other friends of the same age are
              code-switched between Mandarin &amp; the Fuzhou dialect.   a
              similar trend is observed among Shanghai youths</li>
              <li>a preface of a Chaozhou dictionary published in 2009 shows that
              Chaozhou kids below 12 years of age now speak an artificial
              Chaozhou dialect whose grammar is based heavily on Mandarin<br> <strong>^^^</strong> direct quote from the preface:<br> "

              <li>Hongkongers are also starting to feel the threat of Mandarin
              imposing over the Cantonese speaking populations already. a book
              titled "ã€Šä¿�è¡›ç²µèªžï¼Œä¿�è¡›æ–¹è¨€—ä¸�å®¹æ™®é€šè©±ç�¨æ”¬ä¸­åœ‹èªžè¨€æ–‡åŒ–ä¹‹è§£è®€æ¬Šã€�æ¼”ç¹¹æ¬Šèˆ‡ç™¼å±•æ¬Šï¼�ã€‹" is published in
              2009 which talks about Cantonese preserving the many aspects of
              Ancient Chinese not preserved in Mandarin</li>
              <li>a linguistic article observes that Cantonese spoken in
              Guangzhou News Broadcast has given up a few traditional
              pronunciations in favour of Mandarin-styled pronunciations, most
              notably:-<br> <strong>^^^</strong> "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Egypt</span>" - "<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">åŸƒ</span></strong></span><strong>å�Š</strong>"

              Chinese</em></li>
              <li>a linguistic article observes that Hokkien spoken in Zhangzhou
              by people younger than 20's has lost the final "-p -t -k" endings
              and changed them to "-(glottal stop)" ~influenced by Mandarin which
              does not have consonantal clipped finals</li>
              <li>many Shanghainese common words are replaced with Mandarin
