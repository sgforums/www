              <p>You know those from shantou, guangzhou etc where our forefathers came from, they don't carry that typical heavy beijing accent. They speak pretty much like us and I suspect the singlish accent has its roots from there.</p>
              <p>In the past, I can still hear secondary sch students speaking hokkien to each other. Well I don't mean the ah bengs but normal students. Nowadays, I don't hear it anymore.</p>

              <p><strong>i am talking about chinese not taking up the chinese language and speaking dialects.</strong></p>
              <p><br>And i am saying you have to get pass the issued of RACE when you talk about language...?  don't just learned the language because you identified yourself as a Race and coheres to learn Mandarin because of identity.  But Rather where you are located. </p>
              <p>And in Singapore what is relevant There will be folks that find Mandarin is what they value ...... by all means. But For those who assume English or other language is what they choose to focus that should be a CHOICE.</p>
              <p>You Speak the language where you grew up. There are 4 basic races infact they are all 4 languages are relevant.</p>
              <p>Immigration has resulted in diverse cultural mingle together its is hard to contain yourself with monolitics language and cultures.</p>
              <p>In South America there are 3rd generation of koreans, Chinese that grew up and speak spanish, In Europes there are Asian, Chinese that are born and grew up in Europes.</p>
              <p>There are foreigners who speak fluent mandarin......who had remain in Asia for a long time that they reside here in Asia.</p>
              <p>Like i say open up your mind and go beyond the subject of RACE  is equal to language....</p>

              <p>well sgporeans are alrdy not very chinese since many years ago. We embrace the american culture, talk like them. Some chinese are even ashamed to speak dialect or chinese. When we call our uncles and aunties, very few do it by the traditional way. Most would just simply call "uncle" and "auntie" for convenience's sake.</p>

              <p>wah dragg, relax la....dialects wun die off la.....at least not in sg. You will be sure in China, it's very much alive. In Singapore, I give it another 100 years. Sometimes, it can't be helped. It's just that nowadays, a hokkien will marry a cantonese or whatever combinations. So lydat when the kids come out, they listen to the parents speak what? English or your mother's tongue (tongue in cheek!) of course.</p>

              <p>i am sure its not difficult to learn both.  i did!! my father was a hokkien and my mum a cantonese.  i can speak both dialects well.  i can speak english, chinese and japanese.</p>

              <p>it would be ideal if we can keep our dialects and mandarin as well.</p>
              <p>if its too much drop the dialects but keep the language.  english, for working reasons and chinese for your roots.</p>
              <p>is that not possible?  i notice there are more and more people not even bothering to try.  they just drop mandarin outright and focus on english.  student nowadays can take so many subjects at one go but cant cope with 2 languages?</p>

              <p>it's a sad thing but a fact :</p>
              <p>although many Chinese in China (when asked by me) says that "Yes, we still pretty much speak dialects back at home - China"</p>
              <p>it is observed through scholarly studies by linguists that certain number of major dialects in China <span style="text-decoration: underline;">are also in the process of dying</span>, by way of erosion of Standard Mandarin vocabulary and changes in phonology by way of Mandarin influence</p>
              <p>usual man-on-the-street won't notice this change, that's why they still claim dialects are very pretty much alive</p>
              <p>some examples:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>i asked a Fuzhou young girl before (6 years ago), she told me roughly 30%-40% of her vocab with other friends of the same age are code-switched between Mandarin &amp; the Fuzhou dialect.   a similar trend is observed among Shanghai youths</li>
              <li>a preface of a Chaozhou dictionary published in 2009 shows that Chaozhou kids below 12 years of age now speak an artificial Chaozhou dialect whose grammar is based heavily on Mandarin<br><strong>^^^</strong> direct quote from the preface:<br>" ä¸€ç›´ä»¥ä¾†ï¼Œæˆ‘å°�æ½®æ±•åœ°å�€å°�å­¸ç”Ÿæ½®å·žè©±èªžè¨€èƒ½åŠ›çš„é€€åŒ–æ·±ä»¥çˆ²æ…®ã€‚æ�®äº†è§£ï¼Œ<strong>ç›®å‰�æ½®æ±•åœ°å�€æœ‰éƒ¨åˆ†å°�å­¸ç”Ÿåœ¨å­¸æ ¡è£�æ˜¯<span style="color: #ff0000;">è�¼ä¸�åˆ°ä¹Ÿä¸�èƒ½è¬›æ½®å·žè©±çš„</span></strong>ï¼Œç”±æ­¤å¸¶ä¾†çš„å•�é¡Œæ˜¯ï¼Œç›¸ç•¶éƒ¨åˆ†çš„<span style="text-decoration: underline;">æ½®æ±•å°�å­¸ç”Ÿä¸�æœƒè¬›æº–ç¢ºã€�æµ�åˆ©è€Œå�ˆç”Ÿå‹•çš„æ½®å·žè©±å�£èªž</span>ï¼Œè€Œå�ªæœƒæ‹—è‘—å�£ï¼Œ<strong>ç”¨æ½®å·žè©±çš„è®€éŸ³å¿µè‘—æ—¢åƒ�æ˜¯æ™®é€šè©±æ›¸é�¢èªžè€Œå�ˆå¤¾é›œè‘—æ½®å·žè©±ç‰¹é»žçš„å�Šæ–‡ä¸�ç™½çš„æ¯«ç„¡ç”Ÿæ°£çš„“ç¡¬è­¯”çš„æ›¸é�¢æ½®å·žè©±</strong>ï¼Œã€‚ã€‚ã€‚"</li>
              <li>Hongkongers are also starting to feel the threat of Mandarin imposing over the Cantonese speaking populations already. a book titled "ã€Šä¿�è¡›ç²µèªžï¼Œä¿�è¡›æ–¹è¨€—ä¸�å®¹æ™®é€šè©±ç�¨æ”¬ä¸­åœ‹èªžè¨€æ–‡åŒ–ä¹‹è§£è®€æ¬Šã€�æ¼”ç¹¹æ¬Šèˆ‡ç™¼å±•æ¬Šï¼�ã€‹" is published in 2009 which talks about Cantonese preserving the many aspects of Ancient Chinese not preserved in Mandarin</li>
              <li>a linguistic article observes that Cantonese spoken in Guangzhou News Broadcast has given up a few traditional pronunciations in favour of Mandarin-styled pronunciations, most notably:-<br><strong>^^^</strong> "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Egypt</span>" - "<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">åŸƒ</span></strong></span><strong>å�Š</strong>" Traditionally pronounced "<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Oi</span></span> K'ap</strong>"  but now "<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ai</span></span> K'ap</strong>"<br><strong>^^^</strong> "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Islet</span>" - "<strong>å³¶<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">å¶¼</span></span></strong>" Traditionally pronounced "<strong>Tou <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tsoey</span></span></strong>" but now "<strong>Tou <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Yu</span></span></strong>"<br><strong>^^^</strong> "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Toys</span>" - "<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">çŽ©</span></span>å…·</strong>" Traditionally pronounced "<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Wun</span></span> Koey</strong>" but now "<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Wan</span></span> Koey</strong>"<br>*<em>note that all the new pronunciations imitates Mandarin Chinese</em></li>
              <li>a linguistic article observes that Hokkien spoken in Zhangzhou by people younger than 20's has lost the final "-p -t -k" endings and changed them to "-(glottal stop)" ~influenced by Mandarin which does not have consonantal clipped finals</li>

              <p>It's english because the people who won the battle over dominant language were english speakers and they wanted to protect their interests.</p>
              <p>If mandarin was the dominant language and Singapore becomes a Taiwan, those english speaking elite like Lee Kuan Yew, Goh Keng Swee, Toh Chin Chye etc, their influence and power in society would weaken.</p>
              <p>If you look at the population stats in 1960s, it was completely illogical to use english as common language because chinese population was about 75%.</p>
              <p>So people like Lee Kuan Yew chose to sacrifice the interests of the 75% and make use of a pretext such as "common language" to serve his own interests.</p>
              <p>This appears again and again in Lee Kuan Yew's career - always for his own interests, but he would use some propaganda to cover up his intent.</p>
              <p>It's high time for Singaporeans, especially chinese Singaporeans to wake up to the true character of Lee Kuan Yew - he is a political dirty rat.</p>

              <p><br>in ROC, hokkien is a language, not dialect. In singapore, you term dialect as something you can speak but cannot write or read, which is not true, we can read chinese character and pronoun it in hokkien, so are beijing and shanghai dialect, their opera is a dialect, but they term it as a unique language.</p>
              <p>Singapore govt had differentiated languages in dialect, which in real, there is no dialects in this world. The honghong can read chinese in cantonese, write it and study it too...so is cantonese a dialect....No, the movie stars are reading chinese script in cantonese...Omg!</p>

              <p>I have a fun time reading my chinese textbooks in cantonese, hokkien, teochew and khek during lesson times as I have already known all the chinese characters in the chinese textbooks and my chinese teacher smiles in amusement when she hears me reading the chinese characters in different dialects.</p>

              <p><br>If i am not wrong, according to my grandma here, she told me, last time singapore radio or what reddifussion channel also got newsreader and story tellers reading chinese text and speak out dialect, nice pure dialect, like Hokkien, teochew, cantonese, Hakka etc etc...therefore, my grandma said, actually all these are not dialects, but the govt make it or call it as dialects because they dun want to have gang and a separated society like teochew clan, hokkien clan and so on, she miss those years of listening to those story tellers..and i really feel pity for my young singaporean friends who are deprive of their original culture and a total lost of identity.</p>
