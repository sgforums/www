              <p>Most of the Indo Chinese in Java cannot speak mandarin or
              dialect, save for a few terms used here and there for money,
              holidays and greeting of relatives the traditional chinese way. Tks
              to Suharto who banned everything spoken or displayed in
              mandarin.</p>
              <p>In Msia, dialects are still very widespoken with the most of
              Msian chinese speaking cantonese; penang and johor chinese speaking
              hokkien.</p>
              <p>In Spore, dialects have been banned in the media and according
              to the old man, it hampers our ability to learn english and
              mandarin. I think it's a miracle if you can even grab a handful of
              teens who can speak dialects. Do you think it's such a waste if
              dialects die off like that?</p>

              <p>In taiwan, Hokkien is a language, not a dialect. We can read chinses character in hokkien, news in hokkien, show in hokkien, it gives us an identity and proud to use it as our nation icon. For english and chinese, it is up to individual to take it.</p>

              <p>And for those folks who think just because you are chinese and need to speak mandarin to be Chinese....that is even a laughing stock cause once you interact with mainland they will tell you that you are not Chinese because you "Think" and "conclude" differently.</p>
              <p>That is why Singapore looks "Chinese" but think "Western" there is a political antidote here at play because China politics would expect comforming singapore to its own interest.</p>
              <p>Its one aspect to learn how to write, and speak Mandarin. Its another to think alike just because identical skin color. That is a projection from a "Monolitics cultures" that is self center and uncompromising to alternatives.</p>
              <p>So if you want to learn Mandarin do it for your own reason rather than listen to politician and foreigners to tell you that is your roots. Cause your roots is in Singapore a multi cultured community families.</p>
              <p>Very soon Singaporean need to speak 4 languages to get around. So don't stop at Mandarin alone.</p>

              <p>the americans included numerals into math for convenience.  dont use that as a comparison.  go ask if they are willing to adopt arabic or chinese as their mother tongue and you have your answer.</p>
              <p>chinese characters are complicated and difficult to remember.  if you can get past this you will notice chinese is easy to learn.  i believe it is the complicated strokes in chinese characters that turn most people off.  it is easier to write in english isnt it?  just mixed the alphabets and you get your word.</p>
              <p>but thats only it.  chinese is much much easier than english.  it  has no complicated sentence structure. (tense, prepositions, articles etc)  if you are bilingual you will agree with me.</p>
              <p>its sad that many chose english because of its benefit to their careers.  the hongkongers didnt see the need to give up their mother tongue (cantonese).  neither did the taiwanese, the japanese nor the koreans.  but they are as successful as us, if not more!!!</p>
              <p>we speak english because we have to.  its too late to change that.  but dont drop chinese and dialects because you believe its ok.</p>
              <p>its not.  its definitely not. </p>

              <p>Just like Koreans and japanese, their Univerisity teaches them using their own languages, and for English, it is a secondary subject for them. But they still can thrive themselve in the international market, so are the German, french and Swedish. English come into our system because of the colonial era, where British flag was said to see no sunset and alway raising. More so are the ruler of the country who are english educated, but it does not mean that without English, you cannot make it to the international enviroment, Toyota chairman spoke no english, so is German Daimler Benz boss and french airbus CEOs. Even if they know english, it is only the basic, and they prefer to speak their own language so as to protray their own culture and brand, a total diversion from English.</p>
              <p>Look at Canada, which i visited recently for a holiday cum business meeting, they speak 2 languages, French and English, and the french communities are doing business as good as the english communities. And if you are a French Canadian, english will be yr second language, but they chose to speak french first, if you cannot understand, then they speak English, and if you still cannot understand, they may try Singlish to you.</p>
              <p>The Russian speak bad english, we call it the Russlish, the like of Singlish, but they are selling Mig planes and other business like hot cake to english speaking countries.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, i would said english is not a must but a need in the international enviroment, as especially so in a business enviroment, if you know different languages of greeting, you are in and get welcomed.</p>
              <p>Hokkien is official language in Taiwan, know as the Min nan Hua, same as china pu tong hua, Mandarin is used as a common language for all chinese around the world, and taiwan is no exception, they use it on media so as to be able to communciate with the world better, but if you speak Min nan Hua to a taiwanese, you are most welcome..in taiwan than a english speaking tourist,,,ho bo.</p>

              <p><br>And i am saying you have to get pass the issued of RACE when you talk about language...?  don't just learned the language because you identified yourself as a Race and coheres to learn Mandarin because of identity.  But Rather where you are located. </p>
              <p>And in Singapore what is relevant There will be folks that find Mandarin is what they value ...... by all means. But For those who assume English or other language is what they choose to focus that should be a CHOICE.</p>
              <p>You Speak the language where you grew up. There are 4 basic races infact they are all 4 languages are relevant.</p>
              <p>Immigration has resulted in diverse cultural mingle together its is hard to contain yourself with monolitics language and cultures.</p>
              <p>In South America there are 3rd generation of koreans, Chinese that grew up and speak spanish, In Europes there are Asian, Chinese that are born and grew up in Europes.</p>
              <p>There are foreigners who speak fluent mandarin......who had remain in Asia for a long time that they reside here in Asia.</p>
              <p>Like i say open up your mind and go beyond the subject of RACE  is equal to language....</p>
              <p> To ADD:</p>
              <p>What about mixed Races.......?  </p>
