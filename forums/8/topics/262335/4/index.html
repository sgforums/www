If she is having relation problems, help her, but don't take her as your GF.<br><br>I hope those who said take the girl will have their GF snatched away by some other guys. =/</div></blockquote>I feel sorry for you .. Reality is all girls are animals, when they find better man, they have strong tendency to jump ... it is only how strong is the feeling, how broad the hands are wide open to welcome her at the other side .<br><br>If you really want to keep your gf, do something, you might have taken her for granted.

Yes, of cos, she is nuts then, better chase her away ..<br><br>Don't always say the girl is bad, the other guy got no moral, maybe the poor guy is not doing his job also.. human are not perfect ..</div>
