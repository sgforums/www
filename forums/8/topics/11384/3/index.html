My bf always hug me around the waist if we're sitting down in bus/train... unless there's kids around,then I'll be a little self-concious and not get too intimate...<br><br>Really, I dun find anything wrong with 20++ years old couples behaving intimately... But it will be different if the case is with 15++ kids in uniform...</div></blockquote>The 20++ "woman" is what some call an intellectually impaired piece of culturally fossilised "moralist".<br><br>Yours truly can't even see anything wrong with pple holding hands, especially if they display some sufficient level of maturity. Its like nothing to do with age, but everything to do with maturity.<br><br>That "woman" apparently has little of this maturity to see the sense that all r entitled to the right to express and act, according to what they will and believe in. Put it in simple English, "she doesn't even have a darn right  to tell pple off for doing things, which r perfectly legal."<br><br>I do have a funny feeling that this "woman" is jealous. lol. What to do..... Some pple r really more blessed than others.<br><br>It is desirable to have pple behaving the way we would like them to, but who r we to tell others how to behave?

We sat down and as usual, my bf just put his arm around my waist, and was talking softly near my ear.<br>( No, we don't wear school uniforms, he was dressed decently in a polo shirt and pants, whilst I wore a highnecked white tee with jeans)<br>I noticed a woman in abt her mid twenties or so glaring at me, had no idea why, so peacably decided not to stare back and cause a confrontation.<br><br>Suddenly she got off her seat, walked over and started yelling at me ( I say me, cos she directed all her words at me, and not at my bf)<br><br>She said:'This is a public transport and there are children! If you want to do this, do it at home!', all the while glaring fiercely at me. In order to prevent himself from making a scene and scolding that woman all the unflattering things that he wanted to say, as not to ruin our day totally, he simply got up and dragged me towards the exit of the bus. I was in shock, and was quite reluctant to get off as I wanted to clarify what was so scandalous abt his putting his arm around me.<br><br>I'm still quite mad at her, cos I don't understand what caused her to fly off the handle like that. I wanted to give her a piece of my mind, but I guess its not worth my effort.<br><br>What do u guys think? Were we in the wrong? I just feel that she shouldn't have gotten away with this, since she threw a tantrum and we just let her get away with it. She was still yelling stuff at us after we left the bus... The rest of the passengers were giving her weird looks though...Don't know what to think now...<br></div></blockquote>Think that lady just broke off with bf lah..thats why jealous of you.

We sat down and as usual, my bf just put his arm around my waist, and was talking softly near my ear.<br>( No, we don't wear school uniforms, he was dressed decently in a polo shirt and pants, whilst I wore a highnecked white tee with jeans)<br>I noticed a woman in abt her mid twenties or so glaring at me, had no idea why, so peacably decided not to stare back and cause a confrontation.<br><br>Suddenly she got off her seat, walked over and started yelling at me ( I say me, cos she directed all her words at me, and not at my bf)<br><br>She said:'This is a public transport and there are children! If you want to do this, do it at home!', all the while glaring fiercely at me. In order to prevent himself from making a scene and scolding that woman all the unflattering things that he wanted to say, as not to ruin our day totally, he simply got up and dragged me towards the exit of the bus. I was in shock, and was quite reluctant to get off as I wanted to clarify what was so scandalous abt his putting his arm around me.<br><br>I'm still quite mad at her, cos I don't understand what caused her to fly off the handle like that. I wanted to give her a piece of my mind, but I guess its not worth my effort.<br><br>What do u guys think? Were we in the wrong? I just feel that she shouldn't have gotten away with this, since she threw a tantrum and we just let her get away with it. She was still yelling stuff at us after we left the bus... The rest of the passengers were giving her weird looks though...Don't know what to think now...<br></div></blockquote>I will pass her my hp.
