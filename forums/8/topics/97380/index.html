            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Security in Singapore schools is currently under review by the Education Ministry and the National Security Coordination Centre with details expected next month.<br><br>This is to prevent any incidents such as the recent Beslan school tragedy in Russia.<br><br>At a dialogue with some 400 grassroots leaders, Deputy Prime Minister Dr Tony Tan also revealed that measures at Singapore's missions and embassies have been stepped up in the wake of recent incidents.<br><br>One parent asked: "After hearing the news about the terror attack in a school in Russia - I want to ask the panel what are the security measures taken by the government to protect the schools, protect our children?"<br><br>This was one key question raised at the dialogue and the assurance from the Deputy Prime Minister was swift.<br><br>Dr Tan, who is also Coordinating Minister for Security, said: "We cannot let what happened in Beslan happen in Singapore, and we will not let that happen. The government will take all possible steps to ensure that terrorists don't have such an opportunity to attack our children."<br><br>Although schools have taken measures to keep students safe, the current review could bring changes.<br><br>"We will need to be more vigilant in our schools so that if strangers come in, if unauthorised people are noticed in the school, teachers will be alerted, students will be alerted - but at the same time we don't want to be paranoid that people feel frightened of sending children to schools. But Beslan happened, you can't wish that away," said another parent.<br><br>So, what kind of measures can we see in schools? And will teachers play a role?<br><br>Teachers should teach - they are not security guards.<br><br>They have to play a part but <strong>this is a matter which other security professionals will have to be involved</strong>.<br><br>Dr Tan <strong>ruled out armed personnel patrolling schools for now but one suggestion is for parent volunteers to play a role. </strong><br><br>Hawazi Daipi, Senior Parliament Secretary, Education, said: "Parents who are members of parent support groups in our schools, they can play a part through the groups - and work out with teachers and schools measures on how to enhance further safety and security in schools."<br><br>Parents also welcomed the news.<br><br>"I don't think there is really a requirement for armed guards - just by making sure there's proper registration of visitors with ICs - that's enough - maybe add an alarm system if anything happens, press and alert the police, just like the bank," said one parent.<br><br>"<strong>There's not much precautionary measures taken in school </strong>- maybe we can appoint volunteers from the RC to go to school to patrol once a day," said another.<br><br>Besides driving home the national security message to grassroots leaders, similar dialogue sessions will be held over the next few months - with students, the business and Muslim communities - to reach out and raise greater awareness of security concerns in Singapore. - CNA<br><br>__________________________________________________________<br><br>what do you think of this? are current measures at schools sufficient? what other measures can we adopt, or do we even need to do anything at all just because Beslan happened? whatever measures we can have in place will likely fail if a group of motivated thugs forcibly enter the school - yes?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>imho,<br><br>there is no need to do anything just because beslan happened. if anything this is reactive and political - just like having security patrols at MRT stations after the russian bomb blast.<br><br>if the security of our country is safeguarded in general, there should not be fear that any particular place is under threat.<br><br>are we going to start reviewing again, if, say, a government building gets bombed somewhere else?<br><br>but of course, all these are happening, probably cause children always scores high political points, and the terrorists know it.<br><br>are we then trying to stop copy cat terrorists? should we always install measures after something happens somewhere else? are we then always one step behind the perpetrators? what about a more comprehensive security review, and measures, if current ones are found lacking?<br></div>
