I have a number of bad encounters with them.   Just let me tell you one of my many bad encounters with them.<br><br>Knocked at my door early in the morning at 5 am when I was sleeping so soundly (neighbour just finished making noise few hours ago), the damn senior sergeant and his gang, knocked so fiercely and rudely.   Came for something petty , and it is pretty clear they are finding fault.  They came in a platoon for something petty and created a scene, my neighbour was awaken and witness what happened.   I recognised the two kakias, they are not happy that they have to come over to help to check on the neighbour above me because I complained to them they make very loud noise everyday to disturb my sleep.  When they came to help to check, they made a lot of noise and told me off and pushed their responsibiity.  Hack, they came only a couple of times and they are not happy so take opportunity to get back at me by coming early in the morning with the Indian senior sergeant to create a scene.  The senior sergeant threw his weight around, kept boasting to me he is their boss a more senior police and blah blah blah,  and the other police kept staring at me as if I am the criminal who commited robbery or murder.</div>
