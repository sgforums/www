What is more, with the now GEM campaign going on some 'customers' think the whole world owes them a living and can get irrational to the point of insane with  uncalled for demands <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thank you to everyone for all your advice...I just want to say that I didnt expect such response from all of you and appreciate all that has been said here even if some of you are really nuts to ask me to kill er..haha...didnt realise forums had funny members.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I am still stressed as it seems so easy to say sue her or publish it in the ST forums or put it up for all to see..The truth is sometimes when we get the ball rolling, there won't be any stopping it even if it grows into a tiresome and tedious battle, worse still what if backfires? Lawyers are expensive and a lawsuit could amount to hundreds or even thousands of dollars, right? plus, I am a small retailer and don't have much flair in writing strong letters..im afraid my English may end up looking childish to the authorities.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>Anyway, I still look forward to your comments ( helpful or crazy..) I just want to ask anyone who is a lawyer and familiar with such scenarios..is there a government body or agency where retailers can go to get help in situations like mine? Would CASE be the right people to talk to as I am a retailer and she is a customer BUT she has used her business wrongly....HELP!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br></div>
