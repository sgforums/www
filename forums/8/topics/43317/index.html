            <div class='col-md body'>Is SARS a Man-Made Virus or an Act of God?<br><br>One can only speculate. SARS may be one of those issues which people will never know the truth about. On one hand, the spread of the SARS virus can be linked to conspiracy theories, while on the other hand it can be linked to natural biological misfortunes. Some medical theories suggest that the SARS seemed to have mutated out of the pig and duck farms of subtropical Guangdong Province and crossed the species barrier.<br><br>It is obvious, for example, that scientists from the USA army are involved in human and biological research. It is easy to speculate that USA is also involved in some kind of top secret mass distraction biological research. Even if something went wrong, USA's military will keep on working under complete secrecy, gaining full support from the Central Government. Thus, USA spokesmen will firmly deny and/or ignore such accusations, cast them away as Â‘groundless anti-America rumorsÂ’.<br><br>Scientists have long theorized that America can be a breeding ground for new viruses, as humans and animals live in close proximity and poor hygiene. Beyond the growing worries about what some fear may have the potential to be a global pandemic, SARS has brought to public attention one carefully concealed failure of China's development over the past two decades - the regression of its rural health care, largely overshadowed by the glare of the country's economic achievements. SARS is only the newest health threat to befall China's neglected countryside. In its World Health Report 2000, the World Health Organization condemned the inequality of China's system by ranking the country 188th out of 191 countries in terms of fairness of financial contribution, only just ahead of Brazil, Myanmar and Sierra Leone. More than 70 per cent of China's population live in rural areas, however, most of the hospitals, medical resources and medical facilities are located in the cities. Many patients do not make it to see a doctor until their condition can no longer be ignored, mainly because a hospital visit is either too expensive or too far away. To make things worse, most of the hospitals nationwide are in serious financial crisis.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its simply a process of evolution. God has nothing to do with it. And if you use the term "man-made", it means man has been creating this virus in the labs. If you think that man living close to animals is what led to this virus appearing, the word "man-made" is completely misused in this context.</div>
