It is not. I have friends who are degree holders who are earning &lt;$2K (after working a few years) as well as what I indicate above, my brother's friend earning &gt;$10K as a diploma holder. Knowing these people personally and how they work, I think they deserve that kind of pay. And this is an example where ability is more important than a certificate.<br><br>As mention, a degree helps you to get a job. That is about it. The rest is up to your own abilities.<br><br>Also, don't always seek for a job with the highest pay. Go for one which gives you knowledge and experience. With that, the $$ will come later. I have a friend who has a Master degree and accepted a job paying him only $2K. Note that he can easily and has been offered job that give him $3K. But he choose the one which pays only $2K. Today, he earns more than &gt;$9K. Another friend whom I know having a Master degree who got a $3K job is still earning less than $4K today. Again, base on my communications with these individuals, each one deserve their pay although they may have similar education qualification.</div>

I was told to hire an assistant.  Even though I have a degree, I didn't look at qualifications at all when shortlisting the candidates.  There were quite a number of dip holders even though we advertised for degree holders.<br><br>My first round of shortlisting is based on whether there is photo or not.  I think putting in the photo is just as important as the resume itself.  It tells about who you are.  But of course, I only chose those with proper photo (suitable for resume) and not those who pose in glamour shots for taking part in Star Search or something.  Then I look at the expected salary.  If the company is willing to pay only around $2000, no point looking at those who ask for $2800 or $3000.  Even if they get the job, they won't last.  Then the final screening is the job description.  No point I get a high flyer MBA candidate who has not done corporate sales before or does not have any contacts.<br><br>Eventually, the one that I selected (after interviewing a few degree holders and non degree holders) is a diploma holder.  Her diploma is a non related field (I think it's nursing or something else totally not related to the job she was interviewed for).  I chose her because of her achievement in her work and projects which she was able to present to me and my boss at the interview.  She managed to make a few hundred thousand out of zero expenditure for her company.  That's why I chose her.  She is what I want.<br><br>However, my boss selected another girl -- a degree holder who dressed well at the interview.  Due to the nature of our works (having to meet lotsa corporate clients), my boss did emphasise a lot on appearances.  He also didn't care if the candidate has a degree or not.<br><br>I had no choice, but to tell the dip holder girl that she is not selected.  I also told her that I would consider her first if there is a 2nd opening.  But the girl selected by my boss whom we hired eventually didn't last long.  She couldn't do what we were doing.<br><br>I used to think qualification is important.  But it only helped in getting the first job.  I used to attach my certs, papers etc with my resume.  But after getting the first job, my ex boss who hired me told me that he didn't pay attention to what qualification I was holding.<br><br>After a few years of working, employers tend to ask what you do in your last job and what you can achieve.  They seem to be only concerned about that.  And I realised that I did the same when it was my turn to interview and select people.<br><br>But of course, there are still a handful of employers who only look at the qualifications &amp; certs in the first round of shortlisting.  Like what I mentioned, it depends on the employers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't know about you people out there, but after I get my diploma and complete NS, I'm gonna venture into business immediately. What's the point of wasting time going for a degree when they are a dime a dozen? Won't spending the time to secure a niche for yourself in Life bring about a much greater reward, instead of spending four years chasing for paper qualifications? Sure, the road will most definitely be tedious and challenging, but things that are worth keeping, never came easy.<br><br>I'm certain of this statement: <span style="font-style: italic;">Most, if not all successful people, thought differently from the crowd.</span> Thus, shouldn't we do the same as well, if not for ourselves, then for our families?<br><br>And that's another reason why I advocate poly education, because it comprises largely on you being hands-on. Like the critics point out, Talk is Cheap. Similarly, theories without being put into practice are literally parallel to the concept of the previous statement. To put it in a candid manner, I occasionally feel for the students who mug for their subjects, especially in our educational institutes. Like what many participants have posted above, our education system simply teaches us to be good employees. But then again, obedient employees are a dime a dozen in Asia, especially in India and China. I don't know about you, but there's a serious flaw in our equation, which thankfully the government is desperately trying to correct.<br><br>In parting, let us remember that the world had and will always be shaped by those who dare to think and do things differently.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Enigmatic1:</div><div class="quote_body">I don't know about you people out there, but after I get my diploma and complete NS, I'm gonna venture into business immediately. What's the point of wasting time going for a degree when they are a dime a dozen? Won't spending the time to secure a niche for yourself in Life bring about a much greater reward, instead of spending four years chasing for paper qualifications? Sure, the road will most definitely be tedious and challenging, but things that are worth keeping, never came easy.<br><br>I'm certain of this statement: <span style="font-style: italic;">Most, if not all successful people, thought differently from the crowd.</span> Thus, shouldn't we do the same as well, if not for ourselves, then for our families?<br><br>And that's another reason why I advocate poly education, because it comprises largely on you being hands-on. Like the critics point out, Talk is Cheap. Similarly, theories without being put into practice are literally parallel to the concept of the previous statement. To put it in a candid manner, I occasionally feel for the students who mug for their subjects, especially in our educational institutes. Like what many participants have posted above, our education system simply teaches us to be good employees. But then again, obedient employees are a dime a dozen in Asia, especially in India and China. I don't know about you, but there's a serious flaw in our equation, which thankfully the government is desperately trying to correct.<br><br>In parting, <span style="color: red;">let us remember that the world had and will always be shaped by those who dare to think and do things differently</span>.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I sure hope u dun cross the road when the traffic light is red<br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i would like to share my views on this topic.<br><br>i find degree not a important factor when i hire new staff. this is especially true when everyone on the street has one these day. to date, i have more than 100+ degree, master degree staff and some phd working for me - a local ngee ann diploma holder.<br><br>i believe that in this new economy, it really doesnt matter much (in most industries). what really matter is if u willing to go against all the odds,  think different from the lamers and proof the disbeliever wrong. that is why once i finished my diploma and ns, i m out to fight for a living.<br><br>i slaved 18hr every workday for 8 full years. this includes skipping all creature comfort, life's pleasure and holiday breaks, even honeymoon. at one time, i ended in hospital almost died from internal bleeding. i survived it and fought on. once in a while,  some older folks and highly educated individual will poke fun at my paper deficiency and say that i skipped university. what they say doesnt matter to me as these papers cannot accomodate me and my knowledge at all and i dont feel less of a man without those papers.<br><br>soon, i hope to take things at little easy with about sgd10 mio at 40. by then, my kids are in the teens. maybe i will consider some formal education to catch up on things that i may have missed out in the university of life.<br><br>i hope i can provide an interesting perspective for all to read and comment.<br></div>
