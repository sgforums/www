            <div class='col-md body'>the working society is very practical and merciless ..<br><br>education in singapore is a stepping stone .. true some has pt out that working experience is as impt, but without the steppin stone.. it is hard for one to rise steadily ... but yet without any workin experience, one might not learn to catch the ropes as fast as those experienced workers . and might not knw how to play by the rules ..<br>In my opinion , companies tends to wish to get the best of both worlds and thus in a way, it is safe to say a balance of both is necessary ....<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"><br>Originally posted by spectnr1:</div><div class="quote_body">Degree is easy to get now with $$$$.  .... But will it really help u after struggling to cough out the $$$ &amp; wasting precious time on it?<br>[/quote]<br><br>it helps by givin those who went to poly a stepping stone other than our diploma. And for your information, as much as it is easy to get.. the students do have to pay with hard work. So if u tink it is so easy . dun juz blasting ur mouth here and try getting one urself tht way. At least ppl who did tht do bother to help elevate themselves to a better stepping stone.<br><br>[quote]<br>Originally posted by FireIce:<br><strong>i always get this spam mail<br><br>pay a small fee, and they print and laminate the scrolls from unis all over the world.....and send to ur house.....<br>u can customize which uni, which discipline....<br><br>claims to be EXACTLY like the real thing......</strong></div></blockquote><strong>true there might be such service, but still when submittin the degree , one must aso submit their transcripts and etc to the interviewers for verification.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"><br>Originally posted by Parka :</div><div class="quote_body">So what really sets people apart is the interview.<br>Why do companies still need interviews when they already have your resume and result slips?</div></blockquote>if you dont have the qualifications they are looking for, so u tink they will even call you up for interviews ? like i said before , there is a need for a balance of being street smart and aso study smart ..<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"><br>Originally posted by Jazzytunez :</div><div class="quote_body">What make Bill Gates different... is that he know how to grab opportunity....ETC</div></blockquote>in a way, u are right. but sometimes one must not always rely on opportunity but more of creating it by oneself.

            <div class='col-md body'>To me, degree is just a certificate for an interview and also don't give the bloody boss a reason not to promote if you are good. Other than that, useless. This degree thing is overhype. What is important is your knowledge and ability to take up challenges and handle situations. My brother's friend diplo holder was earning &gt;$10K. He was send to Indonesia alone with cash from company to start-up the business over there. How many of you dare to take up such an offer even if you get the chance to do it?</div>
