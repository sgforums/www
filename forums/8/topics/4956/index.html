            <div class='col-md body'>TCS actor/actress smokes? *laffs* It's old news liao lah. I work in their enviroment before, so I know that most of them smokes. Actually, to think of it, the long work hours they have, the many long nights, the pressure, the stress, it is not surprising.<br><br>To smoke or not is not for us to say, it is a personal freedom. A choice. So what? Yes, you might not feel so good about the person, but aren;t we judging on the surface to look at things this way? To me, I dun really care, in simple words, smoking does not mean that a person is bad. It's more the heart that counts I believe. We all have our bad habits, some minor, some major, but then again it's a choice. yes, judgement is for others to give, but as long as you know what you are doing, I still think that you carry on with your own business.<br><br>One more point, what is it with women smoking that some guys cannot except? I dun understand on that point. Man or woman, they can both smoke, does it mean that it is not ok for a woman to smoke while it is ok for a man to smoke? I dun think so, there should be some equality in your judgement, not so much about gender. I know of friends who smokes themself, but will frown at woman smoking and say that hey are cheap and slut and all that. Well, I always told them off, asking them why is it that they can smoke while the women cannot. They always fail to give me satisfactory answer. Things like it does not look good on a woman and things like that, I doubt it's a good answer for any question. Think about it? Like I always say, there isn o absolute.<br><br>------------------<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Just my $0.02 worth</span></strong></div>
