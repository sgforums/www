            <div class='col-md body'>Any woman that does not have a real paying job is a useless good for nothing plain and simple.  Being the gender that has the "duty" of childbearing should not entail any advantages since males have an equivalent "duty" too, NS.<br><br>It seems that these assymmetrical laws were made in a time long gone where a patriachal society was the norm.  Perhaps some changes should be made to make it up to date and for the sake of completeness.   Maybe men can also be encouraged and given incentives to take up more child-rearing responsibilities.  Incidentally, in Scandinavia this is what they are doing to encourage more men to become househusbands so more wives have the opportunity to enter higher management without the burden of child-rearing.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>put it in another way...<br><br>blame the male patriachal order all we want, but once upon a time, staying home to look after kids was considered a luxury because it suggests that the man is bringing home enough $$$ and the wife doesn't NEED to go out and work...<br><br>actually, the law is not exactly unfair lah... lets say... if a guy goes into business and registers his wife as a partner or vice versa and if there's a divorce, its 50% down the middle on the matrimonial assets, company included. doesn't matter if the wife or husband stays at home or works in the company. u got name, u got a share.<br><br>but of course, this is the most clear cut case... but many men like to register their wives as partners to include one more share of the profit to pay out... pay less taxes that way, esp if u are a pte ltd company. so if u itchy backside do that to avoid taxes, then u lan lan share 1/2 lor  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>also, if one party can prove that they had a role to play in earning the wealth accumulated when they were married, they are rightly entitled to a share of it. and it has been argued in courts here that the roles are not restricted to actually running the company... keeping the house and "emotional support" actually counts as well.<br><br>however, there are very few men who are house husbands here so we don't hear that much of divorce cases from the other perspective but at the very least, the house is always a 50-50 split.<br><br>if u ask me, don't be stingy lah... just get through the proceedings fast... argue here, argue there, split house, split bank account, argue about company shares, alimony and WORSE, child custody and child support, u'll just end up broke and bitter at the end of the<br>day...<br><br>seen it happen too many times before liao... there's no "winning" a divorce... except for your lawyer who will probably laugh all the way to the bank...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>
