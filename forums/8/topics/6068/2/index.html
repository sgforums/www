            <div class='col-md body'>I've always regretted growing up. At 12 i was wondering if peter pan was ever gonna come bring me to neverland and now that i'm 18, i know that all is almost lost... hehheh I was never in a hurry, and i don't understand why everyone else was in such a frenzy to become an adult....<br><br>The stuff about children being angels and legacies, well I beg to differ. If you talk to the parents of a criminal do you really think they'll feel the same way?? Oh sure everyone thinks their kid is a perfect little angel, but we all know this is hardly true. ok, so maybe love does explain everything, but love just eludes some people doesn't it? How else could you explain the capacity to hit your own mom/children?? flesh and blood indeed!<br><br>and yes, babies grab anything and everything. they also eat anything and everything. which is why, toys with small parts come with a "not for children under 5" warning! i think its called curiosity.<br><br>don't know why i dislike kids that much, but i sure as hell am not gonna apologise for it!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>maya,<br><br>ok, perhaps not the eugenics practiced in Sweden. That's too sinister. I meant social eugenics where no chemical or medical child-prevention is carried out but stringent social policies that severely disadvantage the lower-classes from having kids. Much more than we have now.<br><br>Perhaps, the number of children produced by couples should legally vary from the level of education both have. i.e.<br>1. only 1 child permited for O level couples and below<br>2. 2 children for tertiary educated parents earning below a certain income,<br>3. 3-4 for tertiary parents earning above a certain income.<br><br>This will reduce the pool of children born into the first couple where poorly educated parents and social-ills associated with the lower-classes are ever-present. At the same time the pool of children born into an environment where high levels of education must be attained and social-ills are rare.<br><br>Also, currently, at least 50% of couples become parents as a natural progression upon entering marriage. I doubt a SERIOUS, and I mean serious soul-search is carried out as to whether they have the ability to nurture. Because we measure everything in our lives with an economic ruler, most base child-raisng decisions on financial means.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Terence (edited 05 February 2000).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by Terence (edited 05 February 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think its a question of ability, its more a question of want: "DO i want to have children?"<br><br>Furthermore, how they turn out is THE big question isn't it?? you can't have a kid and say "oh well lets see what happens!" if you LOVE them so much, its indeed ironic if you don't mind them turning out to be ungrateful brats... raising them is not the problem, its how you raise them. Children aren't like cactuses where watering them once or twice a month ensures them growing good and strong.<br><br>[This message has been edited by MsSeuss (edited 05 February 2000).]</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I guess most of the reasons to have children stem from emotion rather than logics and therefore it is undesirable for some people to have children. Personally, I don't think it is right to value a child's life by the money, time and heartache that the parents spend on him/her. It is undeniable that carrying a baby for 9 months is not an easy feat and  nurturing and educating a child are even more formidable tasks. It is a huge responsibility indeed. However, there is the bright side to everything (well, almost everything) if you look hard enough. There is the joy of watching a baby taking its first step, the joy of hearing it uttering its first word and all the joy throughout the life shared by the parents and the child. These joy cannot be valued by money because they are in your mind, heart and soul. The exception is that if you also value your joy with money then it's another case altogether.<br><br>It is almost cruel to give monetary value to life because life is invaluable. It is like treating life as a commodity that can be traded. Why are people so horrified by parents who sell their children to prostitution? Because children are human beings and not tradeable goods. There are such things as love and affection that should be given freely and unconditionally.<br><br>As to emotional drains and heartaches, what's new about them in life? Breaking up with one's boyfriend or girlfriend also causes emotional drains and heartaches but does that stop people from looking for boyfriends/girlfriends? I don't think so.<br><br>It depends very much on how you see children in your life. If you consider children as burdens then they will be forever burdens to you. However, if you accept them as part of your life, it will be easier to go through the bad times and the good times will be very joyful indeed.<br><br>I think people who really cannot stand children for one reason or another had better not have children because most probably they will cause more harm than good to their children although I think these people already have no wish for children in their lives.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maya,<br><br>It may be discrimination but everything is one discrimination or another, i.e. different levels of education open different levels of jobs, the best-looking person gets the most attention, even the act of buying something from a shop is possible only with currency and not on a need basis. Ok the last example may be extreme but it does show that discrimination is present in one form or another.<br><br>Secondly, in converse to Â‘not all educated parents are good parentsÂ’, it is also equally true that not all poorly educated parents are good parents. We agree on that right? So, education does not determine the quality of parenthood. However education DOES determine the level of comfort a child has, awareness of the world, and the ramifications of anti-social behaviour, and also conveys more clearly the importance of education as a DETERMINANT in order to fully utilise the facilities and means to a Â‘fullerÂ’ life in the Singapore context.<br><br>We cannot guarantee the quality of parenthood on the basis of the level of education of parents, however we do see lower-educated parents as a trend amongst anti-social behaviour of youth. Of course there are other factors like absent-parents in both the educated/lower educated parents families BUT social perversions seem more manifest in children who do not have the means of recourse to facilities of society Â– the recourse of which is of course, education.<br><br>cheers<br></div>

So if social status is not a good indicator of being good parents, why use it?<br><br>a child should be born in a family that wants and loves him/her.  a loved child, rich or poor, will not be a monster.  suppose we let education level decides the number of children, and then there's a trend among the rich not to have children at all, will the govt have to declare that the poor now can make more children?  How do you think that makes poor people feel?<br><br>an educated child does not a good man make.  you mean you have so much faith in the education system?  Even if they know that saying a friendly good morning everyday and opening doors are considered civil and ...classy, it doesn't mean they will do them, and if they do it doesn't mean they will mean them.<br><br>if a family is loves children they will know that they can't realistically raise 12 if they are not rich.  i still think it is unfair to limit people their children using the indicators you've chosen because<br>1) it is saying directly that poor people is more likely to raise a bad child<br>2) giving the rich more RESPONSIBILITY to have children even though they may not want to.  then how are we going to survive?<br><br>M<br></div>
