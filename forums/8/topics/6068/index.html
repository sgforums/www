            <div class='col-md body'>Having children entails tremendous responsibilities.  They take a lot of time and money.  Also, children in the course of their growing-up will undoubtedly create emotional drains and heartaches.  For women, having babies itself is an ordeal with reports from the been-there, done-that folks saying that they were injected on the place we never want a needle to be near to!<br><br>Why have children?  Do you love life enough to be sure that a gift of life is a good thing for your children?  Do you think we still have a future to pass to them with all the pollution going on and the general decline of the environment?<br><br>I am not promoting this stand not to have children.  I am simply curious about what make people choose to procreate.  I asked a taxi driver today and he said that children bring happiness to a household.  Also, the driver's father has done his duty to him by rearing him.  Now it is his turn to do his duty to his children.<br><br>Any comments?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'll have to take a different point of view.<br>Obligation to ancestors? It's in the human biological makeup to reproduce. Why have two sexs if we weren't?<br>Oh and that point of view that you have? Wrongful life argument? C'mon. You think that there's a choice to be born?<br>This is a gift. Its life. Regardless of what the rest of the world is degenerating into (Pollution, nihilism etc.) you have a choice not to follow.<br><br>This is a world where God no longer exists..or at least out of town. There used to be an anchor in life called religion...now there's none. People now have faith in themselves and what they do. They also question their existence 'Who am I?'<br>There is a feeling of loneliness, of emptiness around. I have felt the need for an echo from this individualised selfish society that I'm in.<br>People search for love as the anchor, the new religion. But what we search for is always someone who understands us. I want to find that echo to tell me that i am not alone and that my existence is acknowledged. But love is a fragile flame, it cannot last that long.<br>What I've come to realise is that I'm not satisfied with an echo but I want something more, a soul mate who understands me completely. And the only person to do that is myself.<br>So in the search for the duplicate, some people have children. Who better to love you than someone who's part of you? Even after you have searched around and have failed to find that soulmate, you still can raise the child to become you. This sense of a validation of existence may be what drives some people to have children.<br>Loving a child is so much simpler than loving another individual. They don't ask you why you can't be more romantic, they can't ask you why you can't understand them. They accept.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, my reply to your question will stem from 1 fundamental argument : the biological argument.<br><br>It is understood by the Darwin's origin of species, that the theory of natural selection and adaptation to the environment are one of the key issues in modern evolutionary biology. Species have to compete in order to obtain the optimal or maximal chances of survival in the environment. In the case of human beings, we are able to maximise our chances because we possess the intelligence to deal with the harsh conditions placed by the environment. However to ensure our superiority in the biological race, we need to procreate. Procreation is something that is inherent in us. However, it seems that the evolution of intelligence has shown that now people have the choice not to procreate as well. U see, if the biological argument is correct, then the reason why humans want kids is because there is an inherent desire to procreate to ensure the survival of the family line. Well, it sounds sad, but I think it is how nature works in that sense.<br><br>However, there is of course, the aesthetic part of having kids, is to see them grow up, play with them, and imbueing them with the correct knowledge to live their lives. Unfortunately, our expectations would fall short because some of these kids grew up to not to be the way we want because of their interaction with the environment...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Life starts only with the creaton of birth without birth there is no life. Evolution have to carry on despite mutation takes place as generations goes. Away with the Darwinism..I personally think that having a kid with someone u really love is a sign of intimacy and real commitment...It shows that how much u value each other as to really commit and take care of the kid together .Of cos, nowadays situation beg to differ...It is sad to see that Infanticde happens everywhere...before the little lives know what is the meaning to love from their parents they were left to die...(One thing if u dun have the financial to support ur kid as in really really poor..then having a kid to add to ur burden may not be advisable)<br><br>There are couples who yearn so much to have a baby but due to their biological deficiency..they are forced to turn to alternatives which they really  do not want to...Instead of the question why do we have children?Maybe why should not we have children?Having your very own kid is a sign of sharing...If anyone can give me a better reason of not to have kids , not for selfish reasons..Maybe there is a cause for discussion<br><br>No birth....No life..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 05 February 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think eugenics has gotten a pretty bad rep. In an ideal world, there are certain types of people who should be discouraged from having children. For example we all believe certain traits and characteristics are hereditary. Also, the lower classes who cannot afford children should be limited in their reproduction as they lack financial means to otherwise substantiate the well-fare of their massive brood. These kids without supervision and poor parenting (mostly a result of inappropriate parent-examples) become social problems.<br><br>cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From a scientific (or evolutionary, not sure) point of view people have children because they are controlled by their genes to reproduce. Everything that you feel about children e.g. they are cute they are make life complete etc could be influenced by genes in order to make you make babies. I have no idea how to prove whether that is true.<br><br>Someone once said that all humans want to learn, to leave a legacy and there is something else which I can't remember. So, I think people have children so they can have something to call their very own, something totally unique, that will hopefully survive after they have gone.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why Have Children?<br>They are of course the fruits of your marriage, children does really complete a marriage.(as quoted from someone in the forum) I asked whether my friend whether he likes his wife more or his children. He said children without much of a thought. Imagining a marriage without any children would be just be like a legal way of cohabiting.<br><br>Just my two cents worth on these...<br><br>------------------<br>Audray Gwee aka MaccaStorm</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with Macca that having a marriage without kids is like legal cohabitation...<br><br>Maya<br>As a future psychologist...I need to know the cause before I can give any counsel and futher hypothesis...This is a forum and I am entitled to also have my own views but if U are talking to a psychlogist , one has to see every empirical reasons as well as to see what causation or correlation that I can come up with to help u...So what is ur reasons for not having kids? and it might be due to nurture factors or even developmental..so I have to draw out an analysis for u...and if u really believe in eugenics as one of the reasons not to give birth ...then it is out of ur own will then..However, a psychologist job is to help the patient to see the optimistic of the world...and to lead a better quality life..so maybe u can share ur thoughts?<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 05 February 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rinoa<br><br>Thank you for the offer, but if <strong>only</strong> to share their thoughts on <strong>why children are wonderful</strong>, the rest are doing finely without assuming anything about me.  I hate to argue on this topic, it's supposed to be a nice, warm reading on the delight children bring to life or to see others' reasons why they do not want children.  I am not out to judge anyone.<br><br>I'll say it for the last time, I want people's views on why having children, <strong>not</strong> on me.  And I don't offer counsel, I do not want any, either.<br><br>[This message has been edited by MayaJade (edited 05 February 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ms:<br>I understand your fear of children. If they turn out to be brats, they will drive you nuts! I dun like kids either but somehow I'm more like "to carry on the family line" and "to safeguard against old age". However many parents see it as something wondeful, seeing your baby grow up! I remember a friend told me that you may dislike kids now but if one of them is your flesh and blood, it's a different story!<br><br>maya:<br>Wasting life? Why not put it as wasting away your youth?? Hmmm, and getting so excited about seeing yourself get blownup in size?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>tet:<br>Why not now?? hmmm, if u need help, I'm around!! hahahaha!!

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually I am quite surprise to find so many not in favour of having children.<br><br>To me, they are the angels of life. Children, our offspring. An entity that once upon a time we all were. We mature, we grow, we broke our shell and crawled into the real world. Ever think back and regreted growing up sometimes? I sometimes do. Remember when you were a baby and how your parents took care of you? I couldn't. I doubt anyone could. But ever thought of why they went through the trouble, even though they know that you will never remember? LOVE. A simple 4 letter word, simply explains everything.<br><br>I held the hands of my little baby cousin in hospital. It sense the human touch, and grab on to my fingers tightly, as if he is holding on to something close, someone related. Me being a cousin, can sense that, and I am sure that the contact is even more intimate to the mother, my aunt. She, whom he has been together with for 9 months inside her, I am sure will feel it even more.<br><br>That was 7 years ago. I was still very young. No thoughts of having children, or anything of that like ever cross my mind at that time. But I could feel it. Now, I have grown, maybe matured, and I truly believe that to have children, is a truly enriching experience. Imagine, the first time, he/she calls you dad/mum. The first time he/she walks. The first day he/she goes to school. The first time he/she gets a gf/bf. Watching him/her grow into beautiful/hansome young Woman/Man. Then experience them getting married.<br><br>You have only one life, and there aren't a lot of first time. But with children, your first time doubles. They are your living legacy.<br><br>------------------<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Just my $0.02 worth</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Callan:<br><br>Please understand that I'm not trying to put down your experience, but just trying to contribute to one side of the discussion.<br><br>Babies hold ANYTHING that comes into contact with their hand. Its a reflex. You put Bishamons's dirty fingers in her hands she will also hold them. When they are a bit older you just try to jingling something beside them they will turn their pretty eyes towards it.<br><br>Some say these are the many reflexes that help them survive the harsh world that it once was, and I of course can't remember what the reason was.<br><br>We can get pretty scientific to explain why some of the stuff happen, and most of it can be attributed methods used by genes to propagate themselves.<br><br>BIG BLOODY DEAL. Because it doesn't diminish the emotions that babies, kids etc evoke. The fact is that most people feel an urge to have descendents, no matter what reason. Most will also feel an urge to protect/ care etc for them.<br><br>In addition, since they are emotions, some people can decide not to have them. They might see that its not something that they want, so decide against it. No biggie these days.<br><br>I suppose Mayajade is trying to find out people who can verbalize these feelings that come into play. Since my england not powderful enough to explain that (because its really something hard to describe), I hope I can stimulate some thoughts from other people.<br><br>Meanwhile, callan, get ready to give those young people ang baos soon, and make sure they don't grow up to become brats. Protect them from fellow buayas also. Older cousins not bai sui one you know?</div>
