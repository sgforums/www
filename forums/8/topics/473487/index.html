              <p>A plan to make female high school students undergo mandatory 
              virginity tests has been met with outrage from activists, who argue that
               it discriminates against women and violates their human rights.</p>
              <p>Education
               chief Muhammad Rasyid, of Prabumulih district in south Sumatra put 
              forward the idea, describing it as "an accurate way to protect children 
              from prostitution and free sex". He said he would use the city budget to
               begin tests early next year if MPs approved the proposal.</p>
              <p>"This 
              is for their own good," Rasyid said. "Every woman has the right to 
              virginity … we expect students not to commit negative acts."</p>
              <p>The 
              test would require female senior school students aged 16 to 19 to have 
              their hymen examined every year until graduation. Boys, however, would 
              undergo no investigation into whether they had had sex.</p>
              <p>The plan 
              has met with some support from local politicians, who said the test 
              would help cut down on "rampant" promiscuity in the district.</p>
              <p>"Virginity
               is sacred, thus it's a disgrace for a [female] student to lose her 
              virginity before getting married," Hasrul Azwar of the Islamist 
              Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) <a href="http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/08/21/virginity-test-plan-sparks-controversy.html">told the Jakarta Post</a>.</p>
              <p>The proposal seems to be in response to increasing cases of premarital sex, <a href="http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=id&amp;u=http://www.kompas.com/&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3DKompas%2Bwebsite%2Bindonesia%26safe%3Doff%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26hs%3DT9%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26channel%3Dfflb">local website Kompas reported</a>, including the recent arrest of six senior high school students for alleged prostitution.</p>
              <p>It is the third plan of its kind in Muslim-majority <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Indonesia" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/indonesia">Indonesia</a>, where similar drafts were proposed in West Java in 2007, and again in Sumatra in 2010, but dropped after a public outcry.</p>
              <p>Local
               and national MPs, activists, rights groups and even the local Islamic 
              advisory council have all denounced Rasyid's plan as potentially denying
               female students the universal right to education, in addition to 
              targeting girls for an act that may not have even been consensual, such 
              as sexual assault.</p>
              <p>"There are female students who may have lost 
              their virginity due to an accident − it is not their fault," South 
              Sumatra legislative council deputy speaker HA Djauhari told local media.</p>
              <p>The
               National Commission for Child Protection also denounced the plan as an 
              attempt to curry "popularity" among religious conservatives, and called 
              the move "excessive".</p>
              <p>"Loss of virginity is not merely because of 
              sexual activities," said Arist Merdeka Sirait of the commission. "It 
              could be caused by sports or health problems and many other factors."</p>
              <p>Just
               how the test would be implemented − and what consequences it could 
              incur were it to be passed − is not yet clear, prompting local teachers 
              to question whether those without intact hymens would still be allowed 
              to attend classes.</p>
              <p>Indonesia's education and culture minister, 
              Muhammad Nuh, condemned the plan and said the district needed "a wiser 
              way to address the issue of teen sex".</p>
              <p>Virginity is a prized 
              possession among many Indonesians, particularly in rural areas, and 
              rapidly changing mores in a population of 240 million can sometimes 
              create tension among the country's more conservative elders and its 
              large, more moderate youth.</p>
              <p>Last year saw lawmakers propose a ban 
              on miniskirts because "provocative clothing makes men do things", while 
              in the shariah-law province of Aceh, women have been <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/07/indonesia-aceh-ban-women-motorbikes">ordered to sit side-saddle on motorbikes</a> in order to better obscure the "curves of a woman's body".</p>
