              <p>it makes sense....because from biology theory......when a person eats.....ok...lets go back....the energy comes from the sun.....the sun energy's shine to the plants........then the animals eat the plants......then the humans eat the animals....So.......from each step...there is energy loss.......</p>
              <p>So when a human becomes a vegetarian, it saves some cycle.....and you waste less energy and you save the environment.....</p>
              <p>For example....</p>
              <p>Lets say....a farm....</p>
              <p>To open a farm.....a human must first clear some forest / jungle......then use fertilizers, incecticide....etc....then he gets some harvest yield......then.....if he is a vegetarian......he can eat the corn / lettuce / chai sim for himself.......but if he wants to eat meat......he has to give the corn / lettuce / chai sim to a cow........who will waste some energy......because the cow is moving around, he uses energy for movement and for body heat.......not all goes to the cow's muscle growth.......</p>
              <p>So to eat 1 kg of cow........a human need much more farmland.....much more de-forestation....much more fertilizers, insectiside, and so on.....</p>
              <p>But anyways,</p>
              <p>Saving environment maybe is a "not selfish enough" reason.</p>
              <p>I think being vegeratian, or near-vegetarian, has another "sufficiently selfish and beneficial reason" and that is, better health.</p>
              <p>So if you are not interested to save the environment, consider saving your own health.</p>
              <p>Eating meat is conducive to a host of ailments, such as, high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, diabetes, obesity, and so on.</p>
              <p>Eat more veggie is good for your health, lifespan, and also to make u feel better (because digesting meat consume more metabolic energy, that is why people feel sleepy after eating lots of meat, different with eating veggie and juice which makes u feel light and energetic)</p>

              <p> i think what the Bear has typed is very true especially the last part. There are so much alternative sources of energy in the world. like now someone said they can use 'used cooking oil' to fuel cars or like use corn or something. but the point is, if we turn to things such as corn. the economy will die. becoz almost everyone will start planting corn or whatever. then there will be a limited food supply, and there'll be worldwide problems.This is why Humans use oil, because oil can only be used for certain things such as cars and cooking.</p>

              <p>The group of international scientists said the greatest cause of greenhouse gas emissions is food production and the use of fossil fuels.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>But while the use of coal and oil could be gradually replaced by renewable energy sources like wind and solar, the world will always need to eat.</p>

              </div>
              <p>As the world population increases it is feared that the production of food will become the main cause of climate change and environmental degradation.</p>
              <p>The International Panel of Sustainable Resource Management pointed out that agricultural production accounts for 70 per cent of global freshwater production, 38 per cent of land use and 19 per cent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
              <p>The report, that will be presented to world governments, said the only way to feed the world while reducing climate change is to switch to more a more vegetarian diet.</p>
              <p>"A substantial reduction of impacts would only be possible with a substantial worldwide diet change," it read.</p>
              <p>Achim Steiner, Executive Director of the UN Environment Programme, said ordinary consumers can help fight climate change by eating less meat.</p>
              <p>"The Panel have reviewed all the available science and conclude that two broad areas are currently having a disproportionately high impact on people and the planet's life support systems—these are energy in the form of fossil fuels and agriculture, especially the raising of livestock for meat and dairy products," he said.</p>
              <p>Mr Steiner said governments could encourage people to eat less meat by reforming the system of taxes and subsidies so vegetarian food is cheaper.</p>
              <p>"Smart market mechanisms, more intelligent fiscal policies and creative policy-making are among the options for internalising the costs of unsustainable patterns. Some tough choices are signalled in this report, but it may prove even more challenging for everyone if the current paths continue into the coming decades," he added.</p>
              <p>Lord Stern of Brentford, the author of the influential Stern Review that first argued for economic measures to fight climate change, also believes the world needs to eat less meat.</p>
              <p>He has already warned that the price of meat and other "carbon intensive" goods will need to go up to fight climate change.</p>
