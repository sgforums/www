            <div class='col-md body'>Story EXCLUSIVE TO THIS FORUM<br><br>Yesterday at Allenby Road around 730pm the was an accident that caused a commotion.<br><br>It turned out that the facts are as follows. A Shanghaines women was talking to a man. The man went to his car. The car moved off very fast with the woman clinging on to the  door on the driver's side.<br><br>She said that her clothes was clamped on the door.<br><br>A witness sitting at the coffee shop said as follows:<br><br>"I saw the woman running next to the car and the car door suddenly open and the woman fly and roll on the road a few times. The car then stop at a short distance and then drove off."<br><br>The woman's sister also from Shanghai said that they have the driver's hand phone number.<br><br>All this time the woman was sitting on the road. She had a short mini skirt made of jeans material on and a light coloured spagetti strap blouse.<br><br>When the Police finally came after a call was made to 999; it was a policeman on a motor bike... traffic police.<br><br>He asked the sister to contact the man on the phone. She did and the man over the phone asked her why he must come back to the accident scene.<br><br>She passed the HP to the cop but he was busy on his walkie takie. By the time he tried to talk to the man, he had hung up.<br><br>When the victim's sister called the man again, his mobile was off.<br><br>It seemed as if the woman's left leg was dislocated at the knee as the people there could not move her even to sit on a chair and she remained on the road.<br><br>When the ambulance came and tried to move her, she started crying. The paramedics asked if she lost consciousness and asked the witnesses what happened.<br><br>She was taken to the hospital and her sister went with her in the ambulance.</div>
