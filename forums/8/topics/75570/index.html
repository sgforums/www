            <div class='col-md body'>think nkf should really make public their accounts... and justify the huge amt of reserves. and what's wrong with the charity show? are we that perverted that we would only be willing to donate if the preformer suffers or risk his or her life? looking at sharon au's performance, i really feel so disgusted... yes i felt pity for sharon au, yes i really think those patients need help. and my family makes monthly donations to nkf. but i am disgusted by the way they go abt seeking help... i am totally turned off, especially for next wk's performance by mediacorp stars! i really appreciate their hard work n effort, but is it necessary??!!</div>

According to Straits Times, NKF refused to divulge how much the top honchos are getting paid in the organization, citing 'privacy' as the reason. I think it's total bullsh*t. NKF is a charitable organization, it shouldn't have anything to hide from the public.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>
