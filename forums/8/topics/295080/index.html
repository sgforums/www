            <div class='col-md body'>The following questions are taken from the 'Time' magazine. I was wondering how Singaporeans would answer these questions. Here:<br><br><blockquote>You are adrift in a life raft after your cruise ship has sunk. There are too many survivors for the lifte rafts, and yours is dangerously overloaded. The raft is certain to sink, and even with the life vests on, all the passengers are sure to die because of the frigid temperature of the water. One person on the boat is awake and alert but gravely ill and will not survive the journey no matter what. Throwing that person overboard would prevent the raft from sinking. Could you be the one who tosses the person out?</blockquote>Added by me: what if you are unsure whether or not that illed person could be save if a doctor is found in time? what if you are unsure whether or not throwing that person aboard is enough to prevent the raft from sinking? would you kill that person swiftly and cleanly before throwing him abroad to spare him the pain of being in the icy cold water?<br><br><blockquote>A runaway trolley is heading down the tracks toward five workmen who can't be warned in time. You are standing near a switch that would divert the trolley onto a siding, but there is a single unsuspecting workman there. Would you throw the switch, killing one to save five? Suppose the workman was on a bridge with you and you could save the men only by pushing him onto the tracks? (He's large enough to stop the train; you're not.) Suppose you could throw a switch dropping him through a trapdoor-thus not physically pushing him?</blockquote><blockquote>It's wartime, and you're hiding in a basement with your baby and a group of other people. Enemy soldiers are outside and will be drawn to any sound. If you're found, you will all be killed immediately. Your baby starts to cry loudly and cannot be stopped. Smothering him to death is the only way to silence him and save the lives of everyone in the room. Could you do so? Assume the baby is not yours, the parents are unknown and there will be no penalty for killing him. Could you be the one who smothers this baby if no one else would?</blockquote>These questions are hypothetical and it's unlikely that we'll run into such situation. But these questions serves to question what we define as 'morality', 'right' and 'wrong'.</div>

Even if there is, there is no medication to save him. But if there is medication, do u think he will survive in the extreme condition?<br><br>The second qn:<br><br><span style="color: blue;">i will press the switch</span>[/color]. One person die is better than five people. However, the qn boils down to which groups have more obligations. As in family, parent etc.<br><br>The third qn:<br><br>i will surrender kill the baby given all the people with me is elderly. But the qn also lies in whether the enemy is humane enough not to kill the baby.<br><br>Provided all the people are young enough, i will no doubt kill the baby as, if we are caught, all will die no matter what. Unless again the enemy is humane enough not to kill the baby.</div>

Doing this kind of act = help others, but will be despise by them, even though their heart wishes u to do so.<br><br>two qs: no, the five men are destinated to die and whatsmore, killing to save others is not good either.

You knowingly condemned him to die, when he otherwise would not have.<br><br>If you stand idly by as the 5 guys die, you are only an observer. No one, not even yourself, can blame you for not making the choice to sacrifice the innocent man. Because like i said, it's not a numbers game. It's a moral one.<br><br>It's all easy to say "kill one guy" now, but just imagine if you REALLY were in the situation. Five will get you ten that you won't be able to bring yourself to condemn a man to die. There's a reason why it's easier to just do nothing and let the 5 man die. It's not your responsibility to decide who dies. Don't make it yours when you don't have to.</div>

What if you could kill one to save a thousand? Would you still let the thousand die? The 5 men aren't condemned to die, it's just an accident that's about to happen; the effects of which could be lessened if you just pull the lever.</div>

Heroes may  turn legend but in my humble opinion, every man for himself makes a better mantra to live by.<br><br><blockquote><strong>You are adrift in a life raft after your cruise ship has sunk. There are too many survivors for the life raft, and yours is dangerously overloaded. The raft is certain to sink, and even with the life vests on, all the passengers are sure to die because of the frigid temperature of the water. One person on the boat is awake and alert but gravely ill and will not survive the journey no matter what. Throwing that person overboard would prevent the raft from sinking. Could you be the one who tosses the person out?</strong></blockquote>Reminds me of The Devil and Miss Prym. Circumstances in life are results of time and chance but sometimes you need to know when to go it alone (even if everyone else is against you). If I believe in the possibility of survival by killing the injured man before tossing him into the water, I will. Especially if there is family on board the raft with me.<br><br></div>
