            <div class='col-md body'>I realise that this is a highly controversial topic. You are entitled to your own views, and I, to mine.<br><br>Men in general are highly attracted to breasts and good looks. A myth or a fact? Breasts seem to be the focal point of every conversation between guys when it comes to their "assessment" of members of the fairer sex. But are guys the only ones obsessed with them? If so, how does one explain the popularity of push-ups bras? Or the plunging necklines in dresses and tops? Or the invention of silicon implants?<br><br>Girls always complain about guys going only for looks, that they should really place more emphasis on character and personality. Why then the need for push-ups, if it will only attract the so-called perverts? Of course they are those of you out there who don't wear them, but I'm not referring to you.<br><br>Maybe it's a matter of ego. The oh-so-cliche phrase of "if you look good, you feel good".<br>Confidence booster? Or has the trend taken a sharp turn? With Pamela Anderson removing her silicon implants, is it sign that size no longer matters?<br><br>Whatever the trend may be, we can all be sure of one thing. There will always be those who flaunt, and those who ogle. Let them go about their business, and let the rest go about theirs. Do what pleases thee and interfere not with what others are doing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As a person who fails to fall asleep at unearthly hours, I felt that I should comment on your topic...(refreshing to have a new one  !)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Let me first segregate my targets for dicussion:<br><br>Guys - Those who go for breasts for aesthetic reasons, those who go for breasts for sexual reasons and those who do not go for breasts.<br><br>GUYS (Aesthetic) - This group probably is the type that knows how to appreciate a girl's body. He appreciates her breasts as being part of her total being and how it contributes to the overall image of the girl. Large or small does not matter as long as it "looks right" on her. Truly a case of appreciating a girl for who she is. I would say about 19 % of guys are like that.<br><br>GUYS (Sexual) - This would form the majority 80 % of guys....the so-called typical obsessed male that likes "the bigger the better".....and treats women like sex objects and sexual fantasies. Enough said !<br><br>GUYS (Averse to breasts) - If a guy claimed this for any good reason, either he is 1) Not heterosexual or 2) something else strikes him so much about girls (be it hair, legs or whatever) that he totally ignores the breasts ! Should make up about 1 % of our population.<br><br>Thr girls I will divide into: Those who have big breasts and those who don't....and subdivide into attitudes later.<br><br>GIRLS (Big Breasts &amp; Proud of them) - These girls basically are the types to get a push-up bra and wear stunningly low-cut clothe to flaunt their assets. They are the ones who realise that men are voyeurs and the best way to attract them is to focus their eyes on the woman's chest. Most of these would usually (but not always) have a stunning figure to boot and really nice hair etc...basically they know what they want and they can GET it !<br><br>GIRLS (Big breasts but Does not care) - These are the types of girls who have the assets, but do not know how to flaunt them to their best advantage. Either they are totally sick of the way the media portrays big breasts and are thus trying to find other ways to attract men, or else they think big breasts are no big deal and it is just a physical attribute (like someone's nose being sharp maybe)....any comments ?<br><br>GIRLS (Small breasts and want them bigger) - These are also the types to buy anything under the sun to make their breasts look bigger ! They like to wear low-cut to show off their assets (not realising there is nothing much to show off)....they would fall under 2 groups - either deluded that their breasts truly are BIG when they are not OR forever wallowing in self-pity that other girls have bigger breasts than them.<br><br>GIRLS (Small breasts and don't care) - This is the type of girl to truly admire...because in the face of adversity she still maintains calmness and coolness. Obviously such girls are either 1) Too proud of their other attributes to care about their small size or 2) Thinks men go for something more concrete than just boobs.<br><br>Interesting discussions so far.....would anyone like to add to what I say or challenge it ?<br><br>Cheers !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There's an evolutionary theory for the reason, actually. How true it is depends on your perspective.<br><br>Apes are attracted to the ass, you know. I mean, monkeys caper and dance around, and they stare at each other's red shiny asses to get aroused. However, when  humans evolved, we started standing up on our two legs, instead of loping along close to the ground on twos and fours. It wasn't that convenient to stare at the ass any more(it still is for some guys who clearly haven't gotten over the ape stage though <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">, so we developed a new point of fixation, something that was at eye level.. those two breasts that are right in front of our eyes!<br><br>Most animals don't actually get aroused by breasts the way humans do, incidentally.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Definately the women are more obsessed with it than men...It wasn't us men who asked them to get breast enlargements, although some do.

            <div class='col-md body'>This idea about men and breasts and all, I think was proposed by Sigmund Freud (He was also the guy that theorised that women suffered from "penis envy") about this being subconsciously implanted in to minds of males with regards to being breast fed by mothers. I know it sounds sick but come to think of it....don't men like to suck on the nipples of the female during foreplay?</div>

Humans are mammels.<br>So the breasts are used to feed the young.<br><br>I think it is in the hormones (rite spelling???), whereby guys will be aroused when looking at a girl/women (depending on ur likes).

            <div class='col-md body'>Only because we know that it makes the women horney.  :-)  True.<br><br>AS for Freud, although he was and is still considered the fore most pshychologist/physchiatrist in his field, his ideas have to be taken with a grain of salt.  The guy was extremely biased against women.  I forget the details already(I'll let u know when it comes back to me), but a lot of his "work" is based on his biased views.<br><br>So moderate what u want to believe from him. He was the ultimate pervert so ultimately u will see a pattern in his essays and beliefs.  That's why most of his teachings put an emphasis and attachments/references to secuality.<br><br>Personaly, I don't think that the human phsychology is so perverted that it is influenced to such an extent by our subconscious mind's sexual urges/thoughts.<br><br>:-)   Just a thought</div>
