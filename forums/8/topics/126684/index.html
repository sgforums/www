            <div class='col-md body'>There are a few things you could do when dealing with spam:<br><br>1. Block the address, or create a filter rule to delete any email from the particular sender or domain.<br><br>2. Write an email to the postmaster of the sender's ISP (eg. postmaster@terra.com.mx) and report the spam abuse.<br><br>3. If the sender's email address is spoofed (or fake -- most likely as Cote D' Ivoire domain names do not end with .mx), do a whois lookup at various websites like samspade.org with the source IP address from your email headers, identify the actual ISP and send an abuse report email to the postmaster of that ISP.<br><br>One last thing, do not reply to spam email as it only identifies your email address as active and valid. Hope this helps.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>I just find this kind of e-mails amusing....<br><br>1) Salutation is affectionate... e.g. 'My Dear'<br><br>2) One of their relatives or loved ones (e.g. husband or daddy) must have just died. The dead person must be a MALE.<br><br>3) A large sum of money is left behind and out of reach of the person who wrote the e-mail<br><br>4) Got a son/daughter/niece/nephew (i.e. someone younger) who's supposedly  to inherit that money. Amazingly, this young person cannot get the money and needs help.<br><br>5) Urges you to make a trip down to their country (yeah, then they would corner you and make you surrender your money)<br><br>6) Use a hocus pocus e-mail to sent and then ask for reply to another hocus pocus e-mail (which I assume are untracable).<br><br>7) It's always from some country in Africa (with names that I dunno how to pronounce) or a country where there's BLACKS as majority and plagued by WAR.<br><br>I just wish they could come up with a better story. This kinda of story format is getting a bit stale.  No gore or blood or crimes. BORING!<br><br></div>
