            <div class='col-md body'>Today is my birthday, but very sad to say that I donÂ¡Â¦t have a joyful mood for it. I even don't want any celebration for it, just let it slip away as quiet as possible.<br><br>DonÂ¡Â¦t know why I am suffering form great depression now, is it so-called depression symptom before birthday? when ppl step into certain a age, they usually have some changes in their mind. I think it is quite normal for someone, especial for women, suffering form depression when they go to their 30 or 40. Right? ppl will feel nervous when they enter a different stage of their life. but why do I have such feelings? I still in my early 20s, still young, but my heard feel very old and tired recently, this feeling just started form this chinese new year when my birthday is approaching. This feeling got stronger in these two days, I couldn't sleep for the last two nights. Tossing around on the bed, I though many things what I seldom though it seriously before, for example, what is the meaning of life? What is the target for living? Sometimes, no matter how hard I try still can't solve my boring accounting assignments, just want to give up, keep asking myself, living for study/work or study/work for living? Studying should be very joyful, right? why I can't enjoy it? I donÂ¡Â¦t want to be that. What is my future? What will I be or what I want to be? Seems I donÂ¡Â¦t have a clear direction in my mind.<br><br>After the birthday, get one more year older, really it is time for me to draw a picture about my future and find the direction of life, especially for someone will no longer step into the society and have some responsibilities to take. I ask myself whether my mentality or maturity develope accordingly as fast as the age growing up. The more I asked, the more I got depressed, err, maybe the negative answer was found deep inside my heart <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Miss my childhood, a kid donÂ¡Â¦t need to think such hell things, and donÂ¡Â¦t need to bear any responsibilities, but childhood left me so long, I have to think about it, and not only just think about it Â¡K..<br><br>Did anyone experience the similar depression before birthday? Is it a normal symptom for everyone when growing up?<br><br>Just want to voice out something bothering me, hope tonight will not be sleepless again <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>KK:<br><br>Firstly, Happy Birthday to u. Depression before BD: Only before BD or all the time?<br>U feel u are growing 1 yr older but u are also 1 yr wiser. Many factors contributed to it: peer pressure, work load, career choice, responsibility, friendship, relationship etc.etc..that's the phase in your life u are going thru. Like it or not, life goes on.<br><br>The thinking, expectations, anticipations anxiety gets to u. Everybody have to go thru this, only degree of density differ. Ability &amp; capacity to accept depends on every individual. The process of learning, coping, gaining, realising, experiencing will improved the situation plus &amp; minus the circumstances. But don't go searching for an answer to the true meaning in life, u'll end up going round in circle, frustrations along the way &amp; ending back in sq one. Be contented to a certain degree, u can never have the best in everything. Something, somebody will always be better.<br><br>Just take one step at a time, relaxed, keep cool, stay optimistic, it's really a healthy, normal phase u are sailing thru.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Happy birthday!!<br><br>KK:<br>I once (quite recently) said the same thing to my friend..that life seems to be meaningless...feeling this way made me quite depressed also, but i think everybody thinks about such things as we grow older..am i rite? is the whole purpose of life just to study, find a good job and earn lots of $$? so ultimately, should our goal in life be $$$...if it's only becoz of that, then, i think it's very sad &amp; meaningless....but till now i also can't come up with a better purpose in life.<br>for me, i just really hope that this one year will pass really quickly so that i can graduate and enter the next stage of my life. And hopefully that stage will be a more meaningful one...<br></div>
