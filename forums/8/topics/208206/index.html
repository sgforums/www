However, a bubble made with a pure liquid alone is not stable and a dissolved surfactant such as soap is needed to stabilise a bubble. A common misconception is that soap increases the water's surface tension. Actually soap does the exact opposite, decreasing it to approximately one third the surface tension of pure water. Soap does not strengthen bubbles, it stabilizes them, via an action known as the Marangoni effect. As the soap film stretches, the surface concentration of soap decreases, which causes the surface tension to increase. Thus, soap selectively strengthens the weakest parts of the bubble and tends to prevent them from stretching further. In addition, the soap reduces evaporation so the bubbles last longer, although this effect is relatively small.<br><br>Their spherical shape is also caused by surface tension. The tension causes the bubble to form a sphere, as a sphere has the smallest possible surface area for a given volume. This shape can be visibly distorted by air currents, and hence by blowing. If a bubble is left to sink in still air, however, it remains very nearly spherical, more so for example than the typical cartoon depiction of a raindrop. When a sinking body has reached its terminal velocity, the drag force acting on it is equal to its weight, and since a bubble's weight is much smaller in relation to its size than a raindrop's, its shape is distorted much less. (The surface tension opposing the distortion is similar in the two cases: The soap reduces the water's surface tension to approximately one third, but it is effectively doubled since the film has an inner and an outer surface.)"<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap_bubble" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap_bubble</a><br><br>now i wonder if u geninuely need help in finding ur answer, or u just can't be bothered to google. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Thus, soap selectively strengthens the weakest parts of the bubble and tends to prevent them from stretching further. In addition, the soap reduces evaporation so the bubbles last longer, although this effect is relatively small."<br><br>it's like dissolving. the same amount of soap particle is being stretched out over a larger area, so the surface concentration of soap decreases.<br><br>increase of surface tension is best illustrated by the example of an ballon undergoing inflation.<br><br>by right this means the surface tension is higher, but if u read the previous paragraph, u'll understand why it didn't contrary to what is explained in the quoted sentence above.</div>
