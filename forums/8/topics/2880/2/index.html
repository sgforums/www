            <div class='col-md body'>fadingstar: there may be many reasons for the girl to suddenly decide that she doesnt want to go out with u anymore. Possibly, she suddenly realised that she may be giving u some wrong ideas, so to prevent u from thinking that she likes u, she won't go out with u. However, she wants to continue to be friends with you, which is why she still contancts u by email and icq. This is a possible reason, but to know the actual reason, maybe u shd just ask her (but dun make it sound tooo serious, just ask in a casual way to prevent any awkwardness).<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Shakespeare :<br>A gal will only have a change of heart when she realized that her most happiest moments which she could relate to someone is you. Sometimes, it is alright to get rejected and stay as friends. It would give ample time to get to know the person better. Well, if you are lucky enough to be with this person even though she cannot love you, then thru the test of time, she might someday realize that the man she is looking for, has always been there. So, the moral of the story : persist if you feel that it is worth it, otherwise seek for other greener pastures.<br><br>To Sparkle :<br>Your fourth method is pretty cruel, but I suppose it is better than a bad hint. Just that I feel that women always give very bad hints, which beat around the bush and the other party going nowhere.<br><br>To tetrutetrumon :<br>Quote : "You are a great guy, but there is nothing more than just friends between us... (blah blah blah...)"<br><br>This is what really disgusts me whenever any woman uses it as a tool to reject a guy. You are just saying something in the same analogy in the following example, "You are a nice guy but I don't like nice guys.". I have to tell you that that you  are hurting the guy's feeling even more with such an ironic statement. It will be better if you just bluntly refused him, because this line you say would keep him tangling about the point with the following question,"I am a nice guy yet she says no. There must be something wrong with me." Maybe you should understand a guy from this perspective before unleashing statements which can hurt him.<br><br>[This message has been edited by prodigal (edited 31-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok fadingstar, i appreciate your trust in me but the situation is pretty complicating... ok. 2 interpretations. the first is, she used to like you. till she heard something about you (eg. you're hideously ugly. you're gay. you have AIDS.. you get my drift  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> ) then, she tries desperately to make sure no one thks she likes you, esp you yourself. but at the same time, she isnt too sure afterall, and she DOES like you doesnt she? it isnt somethg you can switch on and off. so she wants to maintain the friendship, but yet, make sure you dont get the wrong idea.<br><br>2nd one is similiar to tet's, in that, she likes you alot. as a friend. and she suddenly realised how her actions could be wrongly interpreted. thus... she wants to remain friends but keep stressing that she isnt interested.<br><br>personally, i thk it's the first one, cos me and my friends do it.. sometimes.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>prodigal:<br>i thk tet's statement is true. alot of times, we like the guys, but only as friends. it isnt true that if you're a nice guy, we MUST like you. nor is it true that we automatically fall for 'paikias'. there's something called chemistry, a spark, whatever it is, it's the deciding factor in a relationship. so what if you're nice? if it isnt there it isnt there. many people believe that love isnt something you can work on. you can build a strong relationship, you can mend a friendship, but love is somethg no one can control. it comes when it wants, and disappears again as mysteriously as it came. you cant blame us for hurting you. have you ever considered how 'bothersome' it can be to reject guys? if you wanna chase a girl, be prepared for rejection. dont expect us to tailor every word to suit you. i really dont understand how guys can always think that there must be different 'levels' of rejection. does it really matter? we rejected you. case closed. end of story. has it ever occured to you that the reason why we wont state our reasons is because it'll hurt you alot? i've rejected guys 'cos i thk they're total losers. cos they're seriously stupid. cos they have no style at all. cos they're poseurs. do you really want me to tell you that? it's alright as friends, but do not expect us to fall in love with you simply because you're a nice guy. cos that's what relationships are about, LOVE.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To ataraxia :<br><br>First of all, I think you have totally missed my point. There is no inference from my earlier post that gals should like nice guys. I totally agree with your claim that gals have the choice whether they should like nice guys. My point of contention is that when a gal rejects a guy, she should just be direct, and instead, beat around the bush. In the shoes of the person who reject and equally being rejected before, I believe that the different levels of rejection as said by you are all crap. My point is very simple, it is just whether you want to be with the person and not. I think a guy whom u rejects will appreciate that you tell him the truth be it how bad it sounds, instead of unconsciously giving him false hopes, for example, giving statements which includes keywords with nice guys.<br><br>The strange thing about men and women, is that women always search for this so-called feeling which you called chemistry or what I will call in the man's perspective as x-factor, and they don't care about the surroundings and insist that they are right. If it turns out well, good and fine. Ninety per cent, this turns out to be disaster, and they will invent excuses to justify themselves, where they should have just opened their eyes and see what is around them in the first place. Similarly, in guys, the criteria is slight simpler, they look for someone who they can feel comfortable. Unfortunately, there exist groups of people who have good character and talented, yet lack of this so-called x-factor thingy which you women are so obsessed in looking. *sigh* Such is the irony of life...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To tetrutetrumon :<br><br>I think that you are associating the point that I was putting forward with my character. Your accusation that I am putting more meaning beyond the words seemed nonsensical to me. I am not disputing the fact that you can't say that. Just when you can quote me your example of guys where your quote of nice guys successfully works, I can also quote you examples that it doesn't work. I have some poor friends who got hanged because of these things. I have to be the poor counsellor who have to tell them that they should give up. There was once I stood up for a friend to a gal who was delibrating leading my friend on with such a comment. Just as your examples are equally valid, same as mine.<br><br>I am not trying to tell you that you should take my point, but merely also point out to you that your method may fail at certain circumstances. What you think is a tactful answer may turn out not to be a tactful answer as where one man's meat is another's poison.<br><br></div>
