(i think i've heard the "it's not you, it's me" and "let's be friends" excuse too many times now...)<br><br>------------------<br>the statement below is true.<br>the statement above is false.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i wanted you to state exactly what situation you're asking the qn in, cos my replies are basically just rough outlines of what i'd PROBABLY do.<br><br>pluckaduck:<br>im unsure whether im speaking for other girls as well, but i've never said that line. probably 'cos if i was interested in him, there's wldnt be a need to since i wld go ahead with the relationship, and if i wasnt too sure, i would thk it better to say 'no' so there wouldn't be any obligations. but as with most girls, we seldom go all out and REJECT you, rather, we beat ard the bush and pray really hard that you get the hint. i think the motive behind tt line is similiar. we want to put you down, but.. without seeming mean. girls just hate the idea of hurting someone, especially if that person has done nothing to deserve it. which is why it's always easier for us to reject a bhb asshole that stalks us all day, instead of a sincere bloke who's really sweet.<br>like ive mentioned before, the two main ways of rejection is to do it straight in the face which is very blunt and rather hurting. so most girls only use it as a last resort. 2: the girl beats ard the bush and drops hints, or gives reasons why the relationship wouldnt work without blaming you. we dont want to hurt you, and we wanna keep the relationship (sometimes). but even if we dont really have that great an impression of you, we dont want you to take it personally (which is kinda dumb since a rejection of any kind is as personal as you can get). so we blame the circumstances, our ages, school, work, friends... even ourselves just to break the news gently.<br><br>[This message has been edited by ataraxia (edited 30-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I like your outlines, ataraxia<br>Most of the time, guys prefer to be treated with the second method, of dropping hints and beating around the bush. Being told straight in the face is really hurting, especially to the ego. Futuremore, it will most probably ruined the friendship btw both of us. Hope I don't get flamed for my comments.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hobbes: I think you hit a sore spot when you said that whoever is dumb enough not to get a hint deserves the harsher treatment. I'm one of those lah. But I can imagine how difficult it is to get someone you are totally not interested in to disappear.<br><br>Just a plea to everyone else, give better hints and do be gentle. Personally, I think if you said "lets just be friends." I'll hang on and hope that something good will happen, and maybe get disappointed later on. Is there a better line than that?

            <div class='col-md body'>sigh I receive a striaghtforward &amp; blunt "No but thanks for asking anyways" from a gal today.  no explanation given whatsoever which makes it all the more cutting since I don't know wat kinda "no" she meant. like "no, I m not interested totally" OR "no, but maybe next time I would consider" tho I think its the former.  anyway I think the word No was a little abrasive for me cos well this is the 1st time I asked her &amp; she is amiable on most occasions. she ended the msg with some niceties like u are a nice guy blah  blah which she figured would soothe the hurt.  well  good thing I m only mildly interested...<br><br>[This message has been edited by mateo (edited 31-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>atax, sparkle (or any other girl out there) - what does it mean when a girl initially mails and icqs you like crazy and pesters you to go out then stops doing all this (i.e. stops being so persistent) and then starts telling you abt other guys she's going out with. and doesn't wanna meet up with you anymore. but still goes out with other guys tho she doesn't want them as bfs, just frens cos she says she's not ready for a r'ship. and then tells you that you're the only guy she tells abt the "other guys" and even tho she knows you don't want a r'ship with her (or any one else for that matter), still won't go out with you! but still icqs and calls you.<br><br>gee.....i know all that sounds confusing and convoluted. but i am confused (tho hopefully not convoluted). atax, you're only 15 but you're much wiser than i am, you know that. tell me what's going thru her head!!! why doesn't she want to meet up anymore?<br><br>[This message has been edited by fadingstar (edited 31-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>aiyah...hard to say...there's no way to sugarcoat something that tastes like panadol is there? however i agree that if any hurt has to be caused at all, its better for it to be over &amp; done with...rather than letting it become a slow and painful process. as someone else already said, it's easier to drop the so-called 'bomb' if the guy's being a wanker, or he's been persistent to the point that you start feeling irritated .. &amp; harrassed. however if he was a friend to begin with it makes things worse..especially if he's a really sweet guy too! um, but as an ultimate LAST resort..just tell the guy you're lesbian. can be effective, under the rite circumstances  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Giving monosyllabic answers? Yah i agree that most girls will give monosyllabic answers if they dun like u. But there are always exceptions. Like i tried to chase a girl last time, she keeps giving monosyllabic answers, so i thought that she dun like me and i back off. After a couple of yrs, i met her again and then i realise that ( she told me) she doesn't mean to hint that we can't be possible together by giving monosyllabic answers. In fact she was surprised that i back off.<br><br>So personally i think, dun juz take monosyllabic answers as a NO, must consider other factors as well. And most impt of all, it depends on the girl herself. some girls do this, but others do that.<br><br>Mind...<br><br>[This message has been edited by Mind (edited 31-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hobbes: You hit a sore spot because I agree with what you are saying. While I feel that its better to be clear about their intentions, I suppose I must admit that no one likes to hurt other people intentionally most of the time, thats why we have to fact the "friends" line. Perhaps like Ataraxia said, its not the line that must change, perhaps its our perceptions and intentions that must change i.e. accept that we are just friends and nothing else.<br><br>BTW, Hobbes, if I might say something, I think you were mistaken for a girl because you mentioned about rejections. Guys don't get to do that too often. So I take it you are one of the chosen few?</div>
