            <div class='col-md body'>Why Poly system so screwed up? Our teacher happy happy can do anything they like de....<br><br>For example my Java teacher... Our participation mark is supposed to be considered 10% only... but as long as do do our practical and tutorial...she give us marks... on average we got 2 marks per week....for 15 weeks...So its 2 X15 = 30 marks... we get a total of 30 marks for participation instead of 10 marks...<br><br>Then there was once my friend in other class. His entire class didn't go for tutorial that day erm...it was Christmas Eve... He go... His teaacher see le, give him 1 mark merit...<br><br>Then my maths lecturer... we usually use cards to mark attendence aand have a 10 mins grace... but he set the systeem to 1 - 2 hours grace according to the duration of the lesson.. Not only that he passes a list around for those that did not bring their cards to mark attendence...Then a lot of us never attend one just sign on the date they never come..then the teacher go update liao... thus aa lot of people run...never scan card also run cos they noe next time can sign name...<br><br>Then my maths lecturer again... this week got a quiz...he say on Tutorial 1 only... Then we look at the question, weird weird one... after the test my friend told me that it was from tutorial 2 and their whole class got full marks and my whole class almost all flunked...Why?<br>Cos their teacher showed them the answer for the quiz and they just copied....and the thing is many other tutors practised this too...let their students copy answers during quiz all get full marks... 2nd time liao...<br><br>My maths tutor lye stone like that just sit down there.... Last Quiz...my friend class alsso all copied from the tutor all get full marks...while my claass many flunked....And all my tutor did was....kay siao kay siao gave my whole class everyone 1 extra mark.... 1 extra mark 4 wat? People whole class full marks hor...mind you not one class but a few....different tutors also...<br><br>Then last semester our maths teacher gave us full marks for participation even though we always never do tutoriaal....<br><br>Then last semester, during presentation... there was this outside tutor called in to grade us..out tutor was just to supervise...and she damn bias... Our group during presentation she can just stand and walk around, my group she even walked out to close the door....then came to her favourite group she stood around and nod her head throughout....<br><br>Why is the system so screwed up? The maths Quiz thing really pisses me off, now even harder to score liao...cos the moderation is being pulled up...<br><br>Not only that since Quizzes is 30% and Participation 10%, 40%... they get a free 40%...<br><br>While we normal students...we only about 24% if we get A and 10% participation teacher wouldn't give full marks since...he only see us once a week participate wat...<br><br>100 - 40 = 60%<br><br>They only need to score 40% to get A is exam...<br><br>Whhile we need to score...56%....<br><br>See the 16% difference?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>aiyah, there is this thing called distribution curve aka bell curve, if go by the book aka zao law giah...then the bell won't appear liao....therefore must make the majority pass then will have the nice bell out. why must have the bell ?! hmmm....orhwice politics loh...if too little people fail means paper too easy, if too many people fail means teacher set too hard and/or teacher not teaching gd enough. and oh yah....its never, i repeat, never the fault of the stuwents once orhwice politics comes into picture. we are there simply to pay $...for the lecturers to perform the wayang show for the fella up there to see and then we get a 'receipt' for our contribution x-years later.<br><br>in order to 'push' people to pass, they 'cheat' during quiz...got a few methods<br><br>1) Open book quiz<br>2) quiz qn is exactly/95% similar like tutorial except instead of give X ask u find Y they make it give Y ask u find X.<br>3) Same quiz for a portion of the cohort, so the 1st bugger class will bwang and then the buggers will spread intel and the next few classes will score but the last few classes will have a different but easier paper...like dat already got the desired sub-bell curve liao.<br>4) Give sibeh obvious tips<br>5) Leave the room for a few mins during quiz time so dat u all got time to refer to fwen or book for answers.</div>

Our teacher happy happy can do anything they like de....<br><br>For example my Java teacher... Our participation mark is supposed to be considered 10% only... but as long as do do our practical and tutorial...she give us marks... on average we got 2 marks per week....for 15 weeks...So its 2 X15 = 30 marks... we get a total of 30 marks for participation instead of 10 marks...<br><br>Then there was once my friend in other class. His entire class didn't go for tutorial that day erm...it was Christmas Eve... He go... His teaacher see le, give him 1 mark merit...<br><br>Then my maths lecturer... we usually use cards to mark attendence aand have a 10 mins grace... but he set the systeem to 1 - 2 hours grace according to the duration of the lesson.. Not only that he passes a list around for those that did not bring their cards to mark attendence...Then a lot of us never attend one just sign on the date they never come..then the teacher go update liao... thus aa lot of people run...never scan card also run cos they noe next time can sign name...<br><br>Then my maths lecturer again... this week got a quiz...he say on Tutorial 1 only... Then we look at the question, weird weird one... after the test my friend told me that it was from tutorial 2 and their whole class got full marks and my whole class almost all flunked...Why?<br>Cos their teacher showed them the answer for the quiz and they just copied....and the thing is many other tutors practised this too...let their students copy answers during quiz all get full marks... 2nd time liao...<br><br>My maths tutor lye stone like that just sit down there.... Last Quiz...my friend class alsso all copied from the tutor all get full marks...while my claass many flunked....And all my tutor did was....kay siao kay siao gave my whole class everyone 1 extra mark.... 1 extra mark 4 wat? People whole class full marks hor...mind you not one class but a few....different tutors also...<br><br>Then last semester our maths teacher gave us full marks for participation even though we always never do tutoriaal....<br><br>Then last semester, during presentation... there was this outside tutor called in to grade us..out tutor was just to supervise...and she damn bias... Our group during presentation she can just stand and walk around, my group she even walked out to close the door....then came to her favourite group she stood around and nod her head throughout....<br><br>Why is the system so screwed up? The maths Quiz thing really pisses me off, now even harder to score liao...cos the moderation is being pulled up...<br><br>Not only that since Quizzes is 30% and Participation 10%, 40%... they get a free 40%...<br><br>While we normal students...we only about 24% if we get A and 10% participation teacher wouldn't give full marks since...he only see us once a week participate wat...<br><br>100 - 40 = 60%<br><br>They only need to score 40% to get A is exam...<br><br>Whhile we need to score...56%....<br><br>See the 16% difference?<br><br></div></blockquote>lol...u a noob with this kind of thing?...welcome to poly man....thank god i grad...<br>my last sem....for most of my modules....my lecturers even gave me wat kind of topics to come out for the structured questions...i didnt complain a little bit...<br><br>this is not to spoon feed u...but make ure poly life tolerable..if u reach 3rd year...some modules have so many chapters...that it is impossible to know each and every one of it...<br><br>For ure info.....lecturers wanna help students...cos they were students b4....thats wat my lecturers told me....sometimes...theres so many things to study.....lecturers just simply point here and there..u wanna study...dont wanna study...thats ure problem....<br><br>lecturers earn more than 5k a month....sometimes as mch as 7-8k....<br>they dont care much la....wat matters is...there mustnt be too many failures...or department heads will go after them....</div>
