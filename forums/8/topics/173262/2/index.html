From reading your post, i learnt that Christians says other religions are bad, there is only one God. From what i have learnt as a Christian, put God in the highest position if you decide to be a christian, i cant remember anything about learning that other religions are bad, just that, if we choose to go on the path of being a Christian, our focus should be on our own religion, not others. Preaching? I've never dont that, not my friends too. During occassions i would just ask, "sight see, want anot, ai lai mai sua"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As i have written in other threads before. If someone is really wanting to seek God, should move to a more traditional, more bible study and less activities church. CHC attract youths by their activities/programmes, as most of us can see that the majority is youths/students. I WAS a 'hard core' and 'brainwashed' CHC go'er. After i left, i think about the things i've learnt/done there. End up, i realise i joined them for the hype/fun (though it can be tiring). No real friendships forged and i'm glad that i'm not 'pestered' by them to join back again (though occasionally ask me to join them for service).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
