            <div class='col-md body'>You're refering to those biological parasites. Well, those are just trying to survive by destroying others. So, when there's no more host, they also cannot survive.<br><br>Sometimes, when you're too into thinking ways to destroy others, you get blinded and will soon be perished by your own evil doings. If not, there will always be a more evil person out there to take care of that.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
