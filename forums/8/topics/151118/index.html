            <div class='col-md body'>Well, for me.....<br>I kind of liked this girl. She was a classmate. She is cute, pretty, and intelligent. She is the petite pretty type. It's very easy to like her.<br><br>I gave her this biscuit called 'Hello Panda' not a single biscuit of course but the pack. I gave 'Hello Panda' to her almost daily. It's not just any biscuits, you see, it's a cute one. Tasty too. I thought that giving her 'Hello Panda' seemed like a good idea.<br><br>I dont remember how long this went on, probably for a few months. Almost daily I would give her 'Hello Panda' and she would always accept and say 'thank you' sometimes in a very cute way. She never declined for once.<br><br>OK.....<br><br>One time I went abroad for a while, around 2 weeks. When I got back, I found out she got attached with another guy in my class.<br><br>I was rather heartbroken.<br><br>But anyways. I never said to her I liked her. Never wooed her. What I ever did was only giving her Hello Pandas, that's it. Of course she would find another guy more appealing. That's natural. What an idiot.<br><br>After some thinking I decided I wasn't an idiot after all. I only liked her and thought it's neat to give her cute biscuits.<br><br>OK maybe I was more like a fool. (a fool is slightly better than an idiot though).<br><br>Well after that I stopped giving her Hello Pandas.<br><br>That guy happened to come from the same city as she did. They seemed to click very well, they could talk for a long time. So at that time I thought to myself, yeah ok, maybe I didn't have a chance anyway.<br><br>One day I was playing a prank on this guy. It's totally unrelated to his status as the girl's BF btw, he just happened to be near. I shredded some paper into tiny little bits and skillfully put them into his water bottle. Guess what, he drank it. One gulp. Few more gulps. Then suddenly he kind of choked and stared into his bottle. HAHAhaaa I couldnt stop laughing!!<br><br>He got mad, didn't really appreciate it. He swore at me, angry, and the girl was there witnessing it all. She was quiet and silent. I felt a bit bad.<br><br>After a few minutes the guy was ok to me again.<br><br>That girl was still quiet and silent.<br><br>Well, that's the end of my story. That's pretty much what I can remember. It really is a great memory. Hope I can meet them again someday.</div>

Most guys are quick to grab any chiobu and the rest are left alone like a plague. only notable thing was that I gave Lina Ng her Xtian name cause she damn bug me to hell.  Even if there was any indicatation of interest... most guys don't have any guts. I only found a guy who had relatives teaching in the school and we can relate to the treatment and expectation from teachers. He rebelled, I obeyed but we had this quiet understanding and he spoke with respect to everyone even though he quite cheeky person. He wanted to become a laywer and I wondered if he did it..<br><br></div>
