            <div class='col-md body'>it's was very disappointing for the kelong case...... fandi, abbas, alistair was heroes, i personally like JangJung(Korean defender). I didnt watch singapore soccer for a long time bcos of this. And Singapore soccer industry was quite dead after this.<br><br>i used to live in Yishun, and when S-league first started, me and a few frens always go support SBW rangers, was a very weak team, always lose..... we always came out of the stadium scolding vulgar words....... but we support(support as in the sense of mentally support and we buy tickets to watch, buy mugs, jersey) them cos we live there. After a few years when betting of S-league started, we hear ppl scolding vulgar words and throwing tickets in the stadium. most ppl watch bcos they bet, not bcos they support a team. But betting really help to increase ticket sales. esp when betting first started, so crowded then.<br><br>for EPL, maybe bcos SCV bought the exclusive boardcast rights, and that time not many ppl got SCV at home, less ppl watch = less popular.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>but really s-league.. management quite ok lah.. but standard still very poor..<br><br>i mean.. look at the teams. get rid of jurong fc SBW blah blah.. den put in 1 paya lebar team... cant even win! and they said they wanted 2 raise the standard? don make sense.<br><br>and the frequent changing of teams.. they wan more fans.. for example, i supported SBW for as long as i can remember.. den when SBW pulled out.. am i supposed 2 quicklly find another team to support and continue support the s-league? of cos not. the motivation facotr has gone. i'm sure it applies to other teams and fans as well.... if say MAN UTD pulls out... will u switch to support Chelsea or LFC? of cos not.. u'll perhaps switch to Spanish or Italian leagues instead...<br><br>and stadiums... wah lao eh. pitch no need say lah. den the stadiums.. no seats 1! all is block.. dirty.. eeyer! tis causes fans to feel they are not appreciated.. well to be fair it's not really FAS's fault..<br><br>to conclude.. how much is a tix? $5? well.. if u pay peanuts.. u get monkeys... so i reckon since u get monkeys might as well dun pay the peanuts..</div>
