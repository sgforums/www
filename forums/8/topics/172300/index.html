            <div class='col-md body'>i think its the attitude that we Singaporeans are more superior than the Fillipinas, the Thais etc that cause people to ill-treat maids. Simply because we pay their wages, we pay for their food and housing, we are superior to them. Yet we forget that they are actually doing us a favour, by keeping the house clean, cook for us, look after kids etc. Its disgusting how sporeans can ever think themselves to be more superior than others, when actually we are all the same.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>my fren's partner who hired 2 maids(look after his kid and clean up his bungolow), he actually treat his maid quite nice. When we go star cruise together, when we go out to restaurant, when we go genting etc.... he always bring his maid along with the whole family. so she get to go for tour and eat good stuff with boss, not like chicken skin rice.<br><br>And when i go to his house during chinese new yr, i notice that the kids dun bully the maid, and thier family wont shout at the maids here and there.<br><br>but from the news, esp. LianHeWanBao, there are often news saying boss ill treat maid stuff. the most "memorable" one i read was about a fat kid force the maid to eat the dog shit, and the mom didnt stop him from doing so.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>every country has its share of problems wheh come to maids.  No matter how, its still employer and employee relation.  Not master and slave thing.<br><br>Maids here have pick up many tricks here and there from friends in their home town or here during their off days.<br><br>SOme try to cook different from what maid going to eat and what family going to eat.   So employers usually made sure maids eat what they cook for family.   like it or not.<br><br>AS for boyfriends, many maids thinks its okay to have Foreign male workers as boy friends or even as friends.  try imagine they bring to your house when you go out.  I have friend whose indo maid bring home a singaporean indian who stay near their area in afternoon and only the 2 yr old son at home.  IMagine the shock when my friend's wife  came home early and found the man in their house.<br><br>WIthin 24 hrs shipped maid back to indo and my friend went to find the indian man and scold his whole family and reported police.<br><br>There many incidents maids do foolish things out of stupidity and jeopardise family and also many maids savings and chastity get conned by foreign worker and even local guys.  If have baby , employer will also lose $bond$.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The amazing part about maid abusers are actually those who are more well educated.. The term well-educated no longer means culture, well mannered and morality but instead the honours you obtain and how many As you get. I think schools are just inadequate to fully educate a person.<br><br>Parents, are another determining factor to how well the education goes. It's an issue of elitism and superiority complex and in order to eradicate this problem. I think it's just up to us to change our mindset so deeply ingrained within us. No amount of charity programs, courtesy campaigns or community work can change a society that's decadent and indifferent to the plight of others.<br><br>Adding on to  the barring of condominium facilities to maids. I just wonder if it's necessary to do that. Aren't maids also 'Foreign talent'? Besides I rather see a maid in a condo then a balding, pot belly hanging over his trunks rich man at the pool..<br><br>Anyway, guys... If ya see someone ill-treating their domestic worker. Would you have the courage to go up and stop it. I bring this up as most of us are gawkers..<br><br>I admit, I wldnt do anything unless a visible threat is present, I'm just afraid (yes SCARED) of getting into trouble..(thank you S'pore for teaching to be indifferent)</div>
