              <div id="post_message_3848485"><strong>I've just received a random email...here it goes...<img class="inlineimg" title="eek!" src="http://www.sammyboyforum.com/images/smilies/eek.gif" border="0" alt=""></strong><br><br>Beware!!! The most important thing is "dont drink the mineral water and dont apply the sun block cream given by the boatman !" <br><br>Ladies and Gentlemen:<br>If you read the stories written below by others, I will tell you my own story exactly as what they said and witnessed by me: <br><br>Please Forward The Story To Everyone You Know: <br><br>I stayed in Pulau (island) Redang And Pulau Perhentian In Terengganu For 2 weeks due to my research and I observed a lot of things done by the local youngsters to the ladies visited there. <br><br>The VICTIMS were those who came alone or with group of girls only, most of them came with one female friend? They acted as a normal driver of the <br>boat for the resorts but they selected the lone or girls victims mostly the dumb Chinese girls and western ladies. But if the girls were accompanied by guys, they will not dare to touch. <br><br>When they reached the snorkeling area, they will 'HELP' the ladies by holding their hands to snorkel here and there? most of the Chinese ladies <br>wear exposed and sexy swim wears and they will peeped their nipples and underwears from behind? <br>The worst part was they seen to bring along their <br>local friends to join the club, to get one or two victims everyday? they gathered on jetty and looking at their preys. Then, they will guided the girls to a plastic containers with fresh water to wash them up, sometime trying to 'help' them by touching their body parts. They girls thought they were friendly and helpful but they have others intention. <br><br>After the girls were so busy to wash and clean up, the locals will at that time handed them mineral water (with something inside), the girls will not <br>aware at the time and drank it. It happened everyday and I watching it everyday? Then suddenly the girls will allowed them to hold her hands and <br>walked to the boats and go away to the resort and finally to the rooms?? with the others local 'friends' followed behind 'TO JOIN THE PARTY'!!! <br><br>Sometimes they will ask the local or western ladies do they like to have some sun block cream. Then they will apply some on their skin. Once, to my surprise the lady naked her breast and let them 'played'. Then I knew what they applied was actually the 'Minyak Dagu ? Corpse Oil',one type of 'Jampi or Curse Oil' so that you will love them. They kissed her until she was bring to the room. SURPRISE!!! ( I think I and my fellow friends were handsome 100 times then the local guys? haha) <br><br>Please remember Terengganu state, the Black Magic is strong over there. Remember, I observed these for 2 weeks but cannot stop them, they have many many friends around, if I questioned them , I will be in trouble....over there. I hope every lady took precaution on this matter and forward it to everyone. Just let them know that if the drivers were so friendly and took advantages on them, they have to beware. I was so frustrated because the girls so dumb to trust them. <br><br>I asked one of the victim and she said she didn't remember anything but She said she have some DREAM that she have sex with the locals,?. SEE !!! <br>Please read what written by others below. My story is true here<br><br>Beware when you're going out snorkling especially ladies' &amp; girls' team only. Boatmen would drug the mineral water when your are busy snorkelling. <br>Later you passed out after drinking the water when you get back on the boat. <br>There are insufficient evidence to prosecute them cause they cleverly done their job including dressing up victim nicely to original &amp; don't leave any traces behind even ejected externally. And when the victims awakened they were told they had a short nap. Salt water further makes it difficult for them to discover on the spot until perhaps later. This happened in Pulau Tioman and can happened any other places. Victims include Italian, American Japanese, Chinese, Arabian &amp; even Malays. <br><br>Please pass this message on to all the world.<br><br>-Yan-</div>
