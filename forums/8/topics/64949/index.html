            <div class='col-md body'>VERY BASIC things which I hope would be of help to you....<br><br>1. TRAINING - To build up your stamina. SIMPLE. You can't hide this one.<br><br>2. MENTALITY - Staying FOCUS on your run. Stay on the momentum.<br><br>3. REST - Adequate rest &amp; sleep a day or 2 before your actual run. Avoid ANY injury just before your ACTUAL run.<br><br>4. CONFIDENCE - Another factor for mentality and keeping yourself in TOP SHAPE. If you wanna do it, BELIEVING that you CAN do it is a MUST.<br><br>5. WARM UP - Proper warm up before ACTUAL RUN.<br><br>6. KNOW your TRACK - AVOID treadmill. Go onto the TRACKS. It's a VERY DIFFERENT thing. Also try to know your ACTUAL running track. If possible, have at least a few practices on it. It'll gain your confidence and control ALOT. Plan your ROUTE. ie. Know where to keep your pace a CONSTANT and momentum STABLE. Know your 'turns', 'upslopes' and 'downslopes' well. Plan APPROPRIATE 'SPINS' for these and ESPECIALLY the FINISHING LINE if APPROPRIATE. From my own experience, this is VERY IMPORTANT.<br><br>7. RUNNING BUDDY - Keep 1 or 2 'running buddies' to encourage and motivate each other during the run. It's important that they should have around the same pace as you and having almost the same 'target' as you.</div>

There's a tactic imparted from a friend who ran around 8mins plus regularly. On the track, you "sprint" on the straight meaning go faster. On the curves, you slow down slightly as in don't force yourself. It is more strenuous to run on the curves.<br><br>The original post is gd and if you can slowly cut down the rest time, it means you can run 6 rounds in 1min 30secs each, you do the maths.</div>
