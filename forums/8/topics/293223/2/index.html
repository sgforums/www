American Muslims' lives' aren't as bad as the media makes it out to be. Generally, Americans are open people and afterall, their country was founded with the basis of being able to practice religion freely.<br><br>Of course, as a minority group in a country, the Muslims there should try to fit in nicely. They shouldn't do what is not needed. As long as they don't go around doing things that might offend or distrub the people and not be anti-social, they should have a relatively happy life there.<br><br>In fact, I hate to say this, but the americans seem to discriminate more racially. Say there are two muslims living in America, one that is of the 'white' descent and another which is 'non-white'. The white will be less discriminated.</div>
