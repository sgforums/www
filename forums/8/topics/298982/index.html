It will soon become illegal even for private faith schools to teach religious doctrines as if they were true. In an interesting twist on the American experience, prayer will remain legal in schools - after all, it has no truth value. But everything that takes place on the curriculum's time will have to be secular. "Pupils must be protected from every sort of fundamentalism," said the minister for schools, Jan BjÃ¶rklund.<br><br>....<br>....<br><br>Demanding that Muslim, Jewish, and Catholic schools stop teaching their own religions as if they were true, which is essentially the Swedish position, looks an impossible task for a British government. But I think it might also be a necessary one. It is certainly the only way to discover whether the parents of such schools really want the "ethos" or the pseudo-factual beliefs and what exactly it is that the people who fund them think they are buying with their money.<br><br>- Andrew Brown</blockquote>From: <a href="http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/andrew_brown/2007/10/gods_honest_truth.html" rel="nofollow">http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/andrew_brown/2007/10/gods_honest_truth.html</a><br></div>
