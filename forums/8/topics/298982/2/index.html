            <div class='col-md body'>amen to this... err sorry heh. I think a lot of you appear to be missing the point, they're not banning religion they're banning the act of telling people how to think... young minds are impressionable and know no different if you tell them that one religion is true - that's not an informed belief that's a taught belief, and I don't believe that any religions will stand up and say they want people to believe out of conditioning rather than true belief of someone deciding that they believe in this god and this way of life.<br><br>That said, if this catches on I can see a lot of scared people in high places who realise without saying as definite fact that their religion is right and without the fear that then instills in the child if they don't believe then religion could fizzle out.<br><br>Now my opinion hehe, I think it's great. I also think religions have no right to be scared, plenty of people find religion later in life and they'll be the people who really believe it. How is telling kids a certain religion is right any different from telling them that one political position is right? you all seem to have a problem with the Chinese way so why not the religious way? Is it really all that different? Except there's proof that the Chinese government exists, and they don't kill millions of people every year with tidal waves and hurricanes do they?<br>A persons beliefs should be their own choice not the choice of the government, a school or their parents. There's nothing stopping them going to church/synagogue/mosque every *insert relevant time/day here* is there? schools are for learning <span style="font-style: italic;">proven fact and known reality</span> or at the very least theorys based around observed reality with basis in proven fact, does religion fall into those categories? no. by all means teach kids what different religions believe but don't force one on them, that's not for schools, that's for church and pushy parents.

The police now publicly admit what many Scandinavians have known for a long time: They no longer control the situation in the nations's third largest city. It is effectively ruled by violent gangs of Muslim immigrants.<br><br>Some of the Muslims have lived in the area of RosengÃ¥rd, MalmÃ¸, for twenty years, and still don't know how to read or write Swedish.<br><br>Ambulance personnel are attacked by stones or weapons, and refuse to help anybody in the area without police escort.<br><br>The immigrants also spit at them when they come to help. Recently, an Albanian youth was stabbed by an Arab, and was left bleeding to death on the ground while the ambulance waited for the police to arrive.<br><br>The police themselves hesitate to enter parts of their own city unless they have several patrols, and need to have guards to watch their cars, otherwise they will be vandalized.<br><br>"Something drastic has to be done, or much more blood will be spilled" says one of the locals.</div>
