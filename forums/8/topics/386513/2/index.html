              <p>They should be returned.......no need for foreign army what.......</p>
              <p>It is an old practice by Britain......</p>
              <p>Nowadays Singapore is an independent sovereign country already.......why still use old Britain colonial practice.....</p>
              <p>In the old days, Britain like to transport different troops from different ethnic groups to fight its war in many theaters of wars.....</p>
              <p>For example, they recruit Indian troops or whatever, and use them and transport them to fight the war elsewhere.</p>
              <p>So this is part and parcel of the British practice.....leftover from its empire days....</p>
              <p>Nowdays Singapore is independent, not part of Britain anymore.....why still use this practice and continue with it....</p>
              <p>These Gurkhas basically are foreigners.....they are foreign army...........are Gurkhas part of Singapore? Are Nepal and Singapore part of same country, British Empire...?</p>
              <p>It is true that it is questionable to keep using Gurkhas. It brings some questions and doubts about the motivations of keeping them.</p>

              <p>Ninjas in ancient japan were famous for biting their own tongue and bleed to death or taking poison when captured to risk tortue and leak of information.

              <p>I agree to what has been said. When it comes down to either peace or war, the ones who weren't forced to fight would obviously do better. So you can expect that Gurkhas would take a bullet for their commanders, while Singaporeans, who generally have the "what do I have to gain from dying for him" kind of thinking would probably consider who they are saving first before they do it.</p>
              <p>Family? Sure thing.</p>
              <p>Friends? Maybe.</p>
              <p>Very nice commander? Ok.</p>

              <p>If you read that and thought to yourself that you would most definitely give your life in exchange to saving the higher ups, think about this for abit. Have you said that due to patriotism, or is it something else?</p>
