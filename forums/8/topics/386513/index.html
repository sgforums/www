              <p>There are 2000 armed Gurkhas in Singapore and their number grows annually by 140.<br><br>This is a dangerous sign. Gurks i believe more heavily armed, from what the photos reveal, with at least Heckler &amp; Koch MP5 submachine guns and M-16 assault rifles as opposed to most of their Singaporean counterparts with their Smith &amp; Wesson 0.38 revolvers. God knows whether or not they have the same heavy weapons as a SAF Infantry Battalion e.g. GPMGs.<br><br>Gurkhas are not Singaporeans. They are mercenaries. AND Mercenaries work for money.</p>
              <p>I pray for all Singaporean police officers, especially those in the Special Operations Command, to keep a keen and watchful eye on the Gurkha Contingent for reasons which i need not say more.<br><br>No one need to look too far into history to know the dangers of having a foreign armed mercenary unit in Singapore.</p>

              <p>Gurkhas are mercenaries like you have stated, but I feel that they are a little special in Singapore's case.</p>
              <p>Gurkhas have been a part of Singapore since our colonial masters took our land under their charge. If I am not wrong, the Gurkhas who serve in Singapore bring their family along as well, and the family is taken care of in return by the Singaporean Government.</p>
              <p>While it is true that they are paid as mercenaries, they pledge their allegiance to Singapore because their families are well taken care of.</p>
              <p>And how loyal are Singaporean soldiers anyway? Judging by the complaints in the army forums..one cannot help but doubt the loyalty of Singaporeans.</p>

              <p>The Gurkhas has been here for a very very long time. I once heard that the Gurkhas are so loyal to whoever's paying them, they will use their body to block bullets for the person they're protecting.</p>
              <p>It's not yet been proven, but then again, how many of our own soldiers are willing to do that.</p>

              <p><br>Mercenaries cannot be trusted but then again why are Britain and other commonwealth counties using gurkhas in their armies and sercurity forces? Gurkhas are known for their ferocity in combat and their loyalty to the nations employing them, hence are considered part of the said countries' armed forces. This is the same of the French and Spanish foreign legions. However, I do distrust â˜ƒ®'s loyalty as a Singaporean. </p>

              <p>The amount of ignorance displayed here is appalling. I'll just reiterate what others have stated above.</p>
              <p>First off, it would be completely illogical for them to start an uprising; their immediate families live here with them, not to mention their extended families at home in Nepal awaiting their return.</p>
              <p>Secondly, being a mercenary is in many ways better than being a conscript. The difference is in the choice, or lack thereof. If you chose to do something you'd obviously put more effort into it.</p>
              <p>As much as I like to believe and live by ideals, let's be realistic here - money is a damned good way of ensuring people behave.</p>

              <p>i play cowboy shoot with them at 500m apart. i will even let them stand at the side along the wind and give them 1000 rounds each. i just need one round per number of gurkocks and stand against the wind. i will even let them fire first.</p>

              <p>They should be returned.......no need for foreign army what.......</p>
              <p>It is an old practice by Britain......</p>
              <p>Nowadays Singapore is an independent sovereign country already.......why still use old Britain colonial practice.....</p>
              <p>In the old days, Britain like to transport different troops from different ethnic groups to fight its war in many theaters of wars.....</p>
              <p>For example, they recruit Indian troops or whatever, and use them and transport them to fight the war elsewhere.</p>
              <p>So this is part and parcel of the British practice.....leftover from its empire days....</p>
              <p>Nowdays Singapore is independent, not part of Britain anymore.....why still use this practice and continue with it....</p>
              <p>These Gurkhas basically are foreigners.....they are foreign army...........are Gurkhas part of Singapore? Are Nepal and Singapore part of same country, British Empire...?</p>
              <p>It is true that it is questionable to keep using Gurkhas. It brings some questions and doubts about the motivations of keeping them.</p>
