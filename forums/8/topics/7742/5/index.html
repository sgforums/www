            <div class='col-md body'>I already knew who are the culprits even before the mastermind reveal herself. I knew who are they and why they did it...At that time, I am just wondering why would anyone in this world would want to hurt someone whom they dun even know(tho they have claimed that they are trying to make me realise who I am actually am but they din even know me in real life)...and the word fren is not even in existent..and I have never knew any of them in real life..except for one of them whom I hardly really talk to...and I am quite disappointed tht she is actually part of the league...but nonetheless it did really show me one thing ...that a real frenship stands thru time and tide...and thank u for all the ppl who did...<br><br>and thanks to u blueangel,devil and shogun  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 24 December 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Take this as a lesson learnt.<br>Not all people are so transparent that you can see through them the first time in contact with them.<br>It takes time to see and realise certain things which are not very clear in the first instance.<br><br>Trust is arbitrary.<br>I do not mean that you cannot trust a person.<br>Know how much to trust. Know when to give trust. Know when to retreive the trust.<br><br>It is sad to see that things which were unintentionally mentioned in a public place (like in here) are being abused by some other people. Initially, the rationale was "for fun". But as things happened, "fun" was somehow metamorphosed into vicious acts (and thoughts) to ruin the victim's life.<br><br>------------------<br>"I know you want me.<br>But can you handle it?"<br>-- Devilot</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rinoa,<br><br>That's quite true. People are like that and so is life. How many would come forward to help another fellow mate when they are in trouble? Very few.

I understand how it is like to be in ur position. It happened to me more than half a year ago. The person used to be my best friend but bcos of many misunderstandings between us, he stabbed me in the heart. Hide behind a nick and post things in the forum. Like tet, he apologise to me in the end as he knew this isn't the rite way to handle things. As I used to say, the world doesn't stop spinning on its axis and time wait for no man so move on and live ur life to the fullest. Learn to forgive, U will come out of this a better person. Best wishes.<br><br>------------------<br>Everyday is a special day, do something special b4 u end this day!!!</div>
