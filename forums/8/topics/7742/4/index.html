            <div class='col-md body'>I read this thread with interest. I am a neutral bystander. I do not know the parties involved personally<br>or in anyway whatsoever. Any views offered is solely from a forumite's<br>perspective. It is for this reason that I might be able to offer some<br>unprejudiced views. Unprejudiced - something several forumites might be unable<br>to offer as most seem to know one another personally.<br>Being humans, there will always be a possibilty we tend to be biased and take sides, oblivious to their shortcomings.<br><br>Impression of Rinoa<br><br>To a certain extent I have to agree with humblepie. Having read most of Rinoa's<br>postings, my impression of her is that she's one whom is not too humble<br>and overestimates her abilities. However, i am also impressed with some of her intellectual postings. Apparently, she has her supporters and her appraisals. But I  must admit I am surprised it has taken such length in time for someone to point out her shortcomings. Maybe her intentions has been misunderstood or maybe not. I shall not provide quotes or elaborate on these points. Whether this is a true reflection of her I have no means of knowing. Different people would have different albeit biased opinions of her true personality and characteristics. This is just a truthful personal opinion and impression of Rinoa's cyber identity and nothing more. I do not know her personally nor am I involved in any sort of hidden vendetta against her.<br><br>Impression of Humblepie<br><br>Choosing to judge one based on his or her "I get it most of the time" intuition would be biased. Therefore I choose to do a impartial analysis and not throw accusations. After all, even a devious criminal deserves a fair trial.<br><br>1. Humblepie is jealous of Rinoa's popularity(assuming she is). So she goes out to malign and backstab her.<br><br>2. There were no ill intentions. These were her frank and truthful opinions of Rinoa.<br><br>However, by lying to UBA and attempting to conceal your real identity, you have created the impression of a jealous schemer. Trust and credibilty has been lost. To put myself in her shoes, I too would find difficulty regaining the lost trust.<br><br>Mitigating factors - Giving her the benefit of doubt. Maybe she had no ill intentions on her part. Just expressing a true opinion of Rinoa although she might have mishandled the situation by relying on incorrect alternatives therefore putting her in bad light and creating this misunderstanding.<br><br>All these are just a bystander's frank   opinions. Please don't flame me for expressing my truthful opinions. Apologies in advance for any offensive remarks.</div>

Believe me...I would have done the same thing for you too..if you are the one at the other end of the line.<br><br>You might hate me for saying this...but honestly..it all sounds like a conspiracy to discredit Rinoa. I present the picture as I see it from my point of view. You have the right to disagree.<br><br>What I saw was this HumblePie extracting excerpts from Rinoa's previous postings and publicly annouced it under the thread 'Humility' amid the sinister laughters of the forum hyena SNAFU. It was a great humiliation for her..wouldn't it? Callan shouldn't have posted a disclaimer as an alibi to support HumblePie claims. That is not a way to treat a lady. Its all sum up to a group of people going after her throat.<br>For what? For not being humble? I give you the benefit of doubt.<br><br>Lastly, I admired your courage to stood out and admit that it was you.

And I do apologise for shooting off immediately before even reading through the whole thread. Simply jumping on a bandwagon and going on to attack a person can be the simplest of task, but I see no point in me doing that. Adds no value to my posts, like I do have any at the moment. I am simply too new to this forum, and please don't be mistaken by the number of threads. And since I have chosen to withdraw my earlier comment, and of course, some damage has already been done, but it can be minimised. I guess hopefully I can keep it that way. You will help me do so too rite?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>"Don't fight with the sea, dance with it......"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Talk about soap opera...Dallas was never this exciting. So....it was the lovely and popular Tet, who's the "mastermind" behind this devious plan...totally unexpected, so many twist and turns ala Hitchcock.<br><br>to colette,<br>So sorry for the late reply, haven't been around for some days, my vacation you see  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>And yes, u guessed my age correctly. As for my status...actually, i have been around this forum for quite sometime, profiling the people in here like you do...a rather interesting hobby if i may add.<br><br>"are you insinuating what i think youÂ’re insinuating? believe me CoCo, if and when i want to or wish to flame someone, i will not nor need to do it behind a new nick nor get someone to aid me. surely you should know by now that iÂ’m arrogant and good enough to flame people or put them down using my own name? "<br><br>I am sorry if i mislead you with what i wrote, i never intend to throw doubts upon you and yes, i know you are a very "arrogant" person who does not need to hide behind the word anonymous.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> From the way you tackled twinkle way back in May (or is it March), i was already very impressed with you. Now, this is a tenacious woman i looked up to, who's unafraid to mouth her opinions and whose bark is much worst than her bite.<br>Hope to really know you better in this forum, although i know only guys attract you in here  :p<br><br>to derek nature,<br>Have you seen the film Vertigo by Hitchcock...your post reminds me of it.<br><br>to tommy,<br>sigh...tommy tommy tommy, what a hero you turn out to be. I hated to say this to you boy, but frankly, you disappointed me alot. First, you choose to take up arms for your dearest friend Rinoa. Upon finding the true identity of humblepie, you immediately backtracked and mumbled somethings about "didn't expect it to be you blah blah blah" So i see, if humblepie is tet, she deserves another chance...and explanation. Hmmmm, wonder if you ever thought about this when you were happily flaming humblepie away, feeling ever so righteous in your thread.<br>One phrase to you my boy,<br>You can't have your cake and eat it too.<br><br>to prodigal,<br>sigh.... i would really loved to have a discussion with you, far away from this thread.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>To Hello Kitty,<br>hahaha, you are such a cute little girl. Injecting humour in the worst possible way and circumstances.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>to snafu,<br>dating with you?!!?!? woooahhhh, i think NOT!!! From the way you took perverse delight in taunting and laughing at both parties in here, i feared of exposing myself to you. God knows what nefarious thoughts you habour in your mind. Beside, i would like to keep a clear distance from those who takes delight at people's suffering. A more contemporary description of you would be the arms merchant prevalent in this world today.<br>Pardon me for being so "dramatic" snafu, but that's the impression you gave me.<br><br>To Tet,<br>I still stand by what i have mentioned in the earlier posting. Knowing who is humblepie now doesn't change my earlier stance. No point in me saying anymore about you, after all, i believe you want to put this miserable episode behind you.<br>So nuff say...<br><br>The main purpose of my posting today is to say hi to prodigal and colette. However, i can not resist the temptation to pass my two bit opinions on some of the forumites posting here. If by doing so is being bitchy, i admit freely to it. Cos what i don't like, i bitch about it. Good day everybody.<br><br>"The opposite of bravery is not cowardice but conformity." --Robert Anthony<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Friends, may I urge all of you to stop contributing to this thread?? No point doing any defending jobs or saying sorry jobs, coz all harm has been inflicted and nothing can be undone!<br><br>What had happen, originally involves only Rinoa and Tet, and now I'm involved too, thanks to u, Tet. And we don't wish to see anymore of you being drag into the pic or as what you guys have been doing now, flaming each other. Stop, pls. Thank You.<br><br>To all those who had stand firm on their opinions, we thank you. And for those who changed their statements after knowing the real culprit, small thanks too, coz u have ONCE defended for Rinoa...<br><br>I know that Rinoa has her own weak points, but she also has some beautiful points that Tet has fail to find out for herself coz she has condemn the whole idea of getting to know Rinoa. That, I cannot blame you. But like I have said to u on the phonecall that nite, one must not be blinded by what u see on the surface, coz your judgement has been made mainly or rather, majority is base on her postings.<br><br>From her postings, one may perceive her as someone who is very arrogant and blunt. But pls, I can assure you, she does not even have a tiny weeny bit arrogance in her bone, whoever has seen her, i think will agree with me that she is very friendly. However, she is very straightforward, like me, and I do agree that its not a very good trait and we will try to improve on that. But from another point of view, we are just been frank, we dun hide behind a mask.<br><br>Human beings are not perfect, therefore, we cannot expect everyone to like us or to idolise us. But I think each and every of us here, do deserve some respect. I don't know y Tet hated or dislike Rinoa so much, but I don't condemn her for that. Even when I know that she don't like her, I don't "unfriend" because of that, cause I find her quite a nice ger. Its just a pity that they are not aquainted or fated to be friends. Fine! So I am neutral in anything that comes to them.<br><br>Honestly, I don't hate Tet, but I'm disappointed in her, I don't believe that she will do such things, but she did. Its a pity. Naturally ppl will think otherwise when u are brave enough to stand out alone to except any critism....but one can't help to think what will turn out if this deed was expose even before she own up?<br><br>Last, but not the least, I hope that such things will not happen again, forumites and friends out there, open ur eyes and ur heart wide to take a look at the ppl around you, accept them for what they are, if you dun like them, jus stay away, its uneccessary to inflict harm on them, coz in the end, you will get to suffer with them. Let this be a very wise lesson learnt.<br><br>I know that I'm not that influenential to appeal all of you to stop this thread, but we wish to put all this behind us now, so pls help us.<br><br>Trinity, specially to you, Thanks for helping and standing by Rinoa, I know that you only know her for a short period, but u understand her very well, i hope that you'll continue to stand by her in Canada, and nice knowing you too ^_^<br><br>------------------<br>If I had the letters HRT,I can add EA to get a HEART, or a U and get HURT.  But I'd rather choose U and get HURT than have a HEART without U<br><br>Sam Sam<br><br>[This message has been edited by UgLy BuT AdOrabLe (edited 14 June 2000).]</div>

Shoos...run to your daddy.<br><br><strong>I am very disappointed in some people here, but I shall not say who.</strong><br><br>Aiyah...little girl...you don't say...we also know lah!<br><br><strong> But there is one person here that really stands out from the crowd... </strong><br><br>That' me...heehee. Litle girl here telling story about me?<br><br><strong>Tommy:</strong><br><br>Yes..little girl...anything I cannot do for you...hahaha.<br><br><strong>Have you noticed that this thread is no longer abt HumblePie?! You blame Snafu for bring this thread up again, but look at it...this thread is all about you now...Maybe should change the title of the thread?!  "Piss on Tommy" ?!</strong><br><br>Is it? Little girl...who gonna change the title? You?  hahaha...give me a break. Another crap just can't talk. Run back to your daddy lah!<br><br><strong>People commented on you and you are defending yourself in very ugly ways</strong><br><br>How ugly?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><strong>Must all this name callings be necessary?!  What "nitwit"? what "dick hair"? What "hyena"?  People here are just stating their opinions, must they deserve to be called these names?!  I think not.  A real man fight with tactics not by name callings...</strong><br><br>Real man? Have you really seen what a real man looks like? SNAFU was just a kid to me lah! You call these ugly? WAKE UP!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br><strong>Just an advice...If one person thinks one way of you, then you can agrue about it...but if there are loads of people thinking the same of you then maybe you should really invest some times in some self-reflection.</strong><br><br>You are giving me advice?...jesus christ! If I am not wrong...someone painted you that bad that I almost fainted...hahaha. So you want me to take your advice? Please tell me you are joking.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><strong>I am not flaming you, nor am I taking any sides...Just want to let you know.</strong><br><br>hahaha....thanks you very much. *Tommy wipes sweats from his eye-brows* Shossh!<br><br><strong>Must you be so harp over Revelation and him changing his post?!  If he edit it then let it be.  Why must you dig at him and make him explain himself because he sees things in a better light now?!  Is this a action of a real man?! I will leave that question up to you. </strong><br><br>You are still very naive...got to forgive you. You see..daddy's little girl...a real man can take and give at the same time. All grudges have to thrown away when two parties sit down and talk sensibly. If you are saying that SNAFU was a real man...I can't help it. Afterall...it is your mouth.<br><br><strong>I think you have ruin your reputation here more than HumblePie did...</strong><br><br>*scratching head* what reputation? Another one of those joke your daddy told you..perhaps?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><strong>Okie, Now for some personal business!!! kekekekee<br><br>Luciffer baby!!!!!!!! kekekekekee...Of coz you can buy me breakfast!!!
