            <div class='col-md body'>Rinoa:<br><br>If you are reading this, this is what I call a disclaimer. Nothing but questions I think of when I read your above post which is greatly disturbing.<br><br>Do you not admit to saying what you have said to me in private? Of course I suppose you do now. I know not that it is suppose to be for me alone, for you never said so. You knew what you said, and I felt no need to exploit on that wound even more, but was it humble when you said that? I felt not.<br><br>When I heard that you are coming back, did I not offered my help to you, in the many ways, even though both you and I know that we are not on fantastic terms? I did. For what purpose do I do that for? To win your heart? I think otherwise, more as a friendly gesture to welcome someone I know. Was there a need for me to do that then? I felt not, but all the same, I extended my helping hand, for I beleive in the uniqueness of each and everyone, and like I said, I believe humbleness is just an added value. So did I cast you out as a friend? No I did not.<br><br>You are often angry about the opinions that I have, but were they not my own? I think they are, and I am entitled to them, just like I respect your views. Do I not always take your views as your own and respect them as they are? I think I do. Many a times we disagree on things, but I took it all as friendly discussion, but I dun think you did, you took it personally. Taking my point against your point each and everytime we disagree. In this case may I ask, how open your mind is then? That is a question I can't answer, for I have not met you yet.<br><br>You might have doubt my sincerity in knowing you, I knew for I have spoken to many you knew. But I have to clear matters. I offered my friendship and nothing more, anything extra that you thought existed, I apologise. Was a rejection from you in that case absurb? I think so.<br><br>Often, you proclaim to be true to yourself. But often I asked you, if you knew yourself then? For I felt that you do not. Do you really? I have to ask again. Always taking the point that you are a psy student into matters will not imporve the way people see you. For I think it is all just a shroud. Psychology is nothing but the study of the mind and how it functions. But are emotions just so simple that it can be broken down into glands and enzymes? Even if it is possible, our knowledge of it has not reach that stage yet.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> But rather, why not expose your life to even more of the world and learn about life? The science and theories of it, is only but a study of the sampling size of the entire world's population. Psychology is not fool proof, in fact till now it is not justified as an evidence in court due to it's invalidity and inaccurate nature at times. I am not discrediting psychology, it has done it's wonder for mankind, but do not fall back on that credit, for it is not all.<br><br>I am not putting you down in any case here, I will still say hello if I see you online, for that is the least I can do to someone I know. But what I have just said, I hope is a wakeup call for you to come out of the ivory tower, to grind yourself into the gem that you are suppose to be. Till then I still think that you are an unpolish stone.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Cheers<br>Callan</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Coco,<br><br>Well, it appears that you seem to have keep tabs on my movement in the forum. The prodigal would be there for a friend, when the time comes. It is good to have someone who appreciate what I am writing. Maybe we can engage in other discussions on other threads, instead of dipping ourselves into nonsensical flaming.<br><br>Have a good day.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Dear Rinoa,<br><br>The "forum" is a place where people are allowed to air their views on certain issues. This forum might be losing essence, but it does not necessarily be forever, because if people do not appeal to reason, there is nothing more to be said. The unfortunate thing about this forum, is that people abuse it for personal attacks and clique formation, something I witness years back when I was in NUS. Perhaps in that kind of spirit, I will avoid meeting the forumites, but rather people I know from this forum, for example Terence, Maya, Colette or you (if there is a chance). I just contribute when I think I can contribute to an issue. The only thing that I can tell also is that you can trust a person over cyberspace, even if you have not met him or her in your real life but it takes time, because you can't tell a person everything in the first time.<br><br>Nobody can be right all the time. There are times where people can afford to be wrong also. If someone's opinions differ, it is just a matter of perspective.<br><br>My opinion is that it is wrong of the people to put up such posts to attack people personally. That is why I speak up for you, first in the position as a good friend (even though we have not met), and second as a normal person who would speak up for someone who has suffered unjust actions but I think that you should be sympathetic to Humblepie, because she did that out of jealousy and anger, and what she did is very human. In fact, I pity the person who did that. I am not condoning her behaviour, but doesn't the Christian virtue tells us that we should forgive and forget about what bad things they do to us because to err is human. It is all a part and parcel of life. At least you are more fortunate than her in having something which the other person is jealous about...<br><br>Do take care.<br><br>yours sincerely,<br>The Prodigal<br><br>------------------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights. However, love is not about finding someone to relieve you, but love is about you devoting your heart and soul to love that someone, even if you know that someone do not love you the way you do."<br>- Prodigal</div>

And if so that ye be stoned by words for being right... then prevail. But if ye be wrong, then humility comes in to know the difference and learn.<br><br>Judgement?

            <div class='col-md body'>To Derek Nature,<br><br>I don't think anyone here who defends a friend are looking to be praised as heroes. If that is the case, I would find it disappointing that the person whom these people try to defend, are just out to impress and are superficial in their own degrees. The world is not made of black and white, but shades of grey. There is only a differing degree in how a person would approach such an issue. As a friend, we just come in and say what we want to.<br><br>To Humblepie :<br><br>Granted your assumptions and assertions are true, you can defend your case easily by merely pointing that people who accuse you are just doing it out of circumstantial evidence. I have no qualms on that. However, I don't see the point of saying anything or even posting anything at all in the first place. Eventually, people would see thru the mask of that person you seek to address to and find out for themselves what the person you are trying to pinpoint is, whether the person is a hypocrite or not.<br><br>I have nothing more to say to this, and I think that enough is enough, and we should just stop making our deductions, and start moving on with our lives.<br><br>yours sincerely,<br>The Prodigal<br><br>------------------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights. However, love is not about finding someone to relieve you, but love is about you devoting your heart and soul to love that someone, even if you know that someone do not love you the way you do."<br>- Prodigal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, Tet,<br><br>Although it did not came to me as a surprise that it's you (somehow I guess), I just like you to know that you are brave enough to admit that it is your error. That is alright, because I have nothing against you since you are willing to risk your reputation for that. I believed what you should have done is to do it in private email, instead of throwing it into the forum and let all hell break loose.<br><br>I shared my sentiments with Colette that a friend is a true friend when he or she can dare to tell you that what flaws you have. My best friend is someone like this, even though we were almost once torn apart because I did something wrong in the past, where the whole world would want to shoot me for it. He scolded me but he is still my friend where he has to defend me against people who are all out to get me. In the end, we are still good friends, even though we don't talk to each other for a while. But when we talk, we would sit down in a cafe or coffee shop in Singapore for the whole night and talked about our lives. Because some friends can go thru good and bad times with us, I would say that those friends are my good friends.<br><br>Anyway, this matter should come to a close. I would hope that the other forumites would not take it out on Tet. She has already apologized and there is no point pursuing the matter or making a big fuss out of it. What we should do, is to acknowledge that both sides have to do something about it, and finally move with their lives.<br><br>to both gals, hope that you all would still remain friends, and be happy with each other's company and don't let such an incident destroy everything.<br><br>That's all I have to say. Do take care.<br><br>yours sincerely<br>The Prodigal<br><br>------------------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights.

            <div class='col-md body'>ohh...so U are the mastermind!!Ahh....but what an interesting turn of events.Now, the criminal confessed and it is like now the victim has to do the so called 'self-reflection'. Ahem. my oh my, it really seems that some ppl still dun catch the rolling ball. In the postings of the victim, it may seems that some ppl prefer to take her postings in lieu of unhumbleness where first and foremost she is merely stating a fact. You ppl rather believed what u all perceived rather than to know who is she in real life. Since she is not what some ppl claimed to be here, there is really no self reflection at all. If there is any reflection, it is that it is going to be a real pathetic case for ppl to scrutinise her like that!Hey hey, who are u to judge her since u only "knew" her through the postings? While ppl in real life who knew her, saying that she is "innocent" and there are no credits in what they say??Tsk tsk. so when a person confessed, does that mean that she is apologetic? Seems not. Now hmm the mastermind knew that she will be found out sooner or later, thus make a confession to gain sympathy. SO, that is the kind of world we are living in, where the ecil triumps over good now? It is so hard to be kind sometimes!<br><br>Hey...where are the other accomplices??Yoohoo!!Oh...Mastermind feels guilty to have pulled down innocent souls and now willing to shoulder the blame.Mastery, mastery!Such is the mind of the villian female lead in the Hollywood movies!!But master, what makes only Rinoa the special candidate for your spurn? If u wanna talk about unhumbleness. there are still other ppl who also need to make them have more self reflection.Oh!!Woe be on Rinoa!!Maybe if Rinoa is not the gorgous one, smart or whatever attributes anyone can think of, no one would have even noticed her!(point taken!)<br><br>Again master, what actually did Rinoa do to thread on ur toes? Oh since it is not jeolously, is it pettiness? Why make life difficult for ppl around? Even if anyone is ever unhumble, at least they are no hypocrites or someone pretending to be nice or trying to create a negative impact in a person's life? Just like a serpent, I might say!<br><br>Have u even been misunderstood and wronged but ppl expect u to be sorryand admit the mistakes where in the first place u have not commit? Such is the plight of Rinoa and she has chose not to interfere and only real frens like me and UbA are running to her defence cos we knew her in real life!!I have seen how this politics are in real life and never knew it happend in a forum? *shakes head*<br>Alright, U win! Everyone sympatise with her!This is indeed not a good place to stay where the good and evil cannot be differentiated!*sigh*<br><br>Master, in life, each to her own, pettiness will not get u anywhere. If u wanna judge a person, please do it only when u get to know her and not just over the internet, I beseeched you!Do u know what a gal like that be labelled in the North America? You would not like ppl to label u as a "bitch". do you, based on the postings u have on this thread?<br><br>Once again, if u have repented, good for u. Dun ever repeat the same mistake!It would be better for you if u were to confess this to the Almighty God with a sincere and repenting heart!!Cleanse your soul I pray!<br><br>Oh dun flame me, these are only my humble opinions!<br><br>------------------<br>When love and hate collides...chemistry is formed.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Trinity (edited 12 June 2000).]</div>
