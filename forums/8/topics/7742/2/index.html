I loved to read your postings...but alas, only damsels in distress (esp those he loved) can make this son came flying from his high high mountain.<br><br>To Naivegirl:<br>You know something my dear friend, if i am to reconstruct all your quotes and speech, i can really paint a terrifying picture of you. For what is woman but a bundle of contradictions and illogical emotions. The madness to this is in the method. True, all those mentioned quotes, given the chance, can be traced back to the speaker and vouched for by others. The POINT is, this answers are ONLY applicable to the QUESTIONS asked, even in the context of it. I can't say i know Rinoa very well but I believed it will be a sad sad day when we women judged one another by the things we say and when beauty and popularity is a sin among us. God forgive me, i know i have been guilty of it countless time...that slut and bitch who attracts MY guys' attention and my BOSS's good grace. ahhhhhh, are we women to suffer from this "dark side" ( that silly Sci Fic phase again..sheeesh) emotion all the time.<br><br>Colette:<br>Catch the drift yet...if i am not wrong, you will put Sherlock Holmes to shame with your tireless tracking and deduction. It's rather easy to guess the primary motive in this crime...and another to guess the perp, or Criminals, as the Great Detective loved to mentioned   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>and finally<br>Humblepie:<br><br>Fantastic, brilliant, devious and superbly cunning! Your methods reminds me of the Gestapo back in the late 30s, before they started arresting everybody with indiscrimination, the KGB 5th Directorate in which disinformation was perfected to art and finally, the Stasis, where information is collected on roughly 15 million people from their birth to death. So I might be side tracking here but simply put, you have the capability to make use of this forum to achieve your aims. For this, I salute you ( As much as a woman can salute, hell, the only war movie i watched is Saving Pte Ryan, where i diligently followed the ass of Tom Hanks as he charged from one beach to another   :p)<br>I prayed I do not have the misfortune to cross your path...for I had no doubt the same or worst fate awaits me. What a terrific show...in which we had the poor suffering damsel, the knight in shining amour and the villain. In this case, I am afraid the villain, is laughing his/her/their way to the bank, knowing that their smearing campaign had worked.<br><br>cheerio,<br><br>P.S. Hey, anybody is free to condemm and curse my little piece of essay but to quote Callan, I am entitled to my own opinions ( i hope i am being fair here oh shining knight   :p) and lastly, as dear Naivegirl mentioned, this is just my own<br>humble opinions.<br><br>"The opposite of bravery is not cowardice but conformity." --Robert Anthony<br><br>[This message has been edited by CoCo (edited 08 June 2000).]</div>

It is true, there will be more heads sprouting out from the 'devious' monster, but hey, as the story goes...the good will win at the end....hahaha. We just got to take it one day at a time.

            <div class='col-md body'>My dear frens<br>After looking at this post about me, I think I have to do some clarification. First, I would like to thank u for spending so much time digging out my threads and paying attention to every single details of what I have been posting. I have ppl giving me the supports and credits...Thanks once again. It is really sad for me to see all these comments above when all I wanted is to tell ppl the problems I accounted and how I feel..and seems that whatever I have said have 'offended" some ppl here.<br><br>Ppl who have seen me and knew me would know who I am and what I am...IS jeaolousy the root of the whole thread? Ha!If it is, then the person really is too immature. I mean, if the intention of the person is to bring me down, I think they must be disappointed but if they want me to get upset...congrats..they have made it!And this is going to be my last posting ever. If I am going to be an eyesore to anyone, then I will leave. I can only say that Miss Humblepie, dun play mind games with a psyc student cos I know what u are getting. Let us put it this way, from the way u write it...it is like a quest and mission. Dun blame me if I manage to find out who the mastermind is of this whole entire plot, and post it in this public forum..It will not shed good light onto u.So what do I want? hmm a public apology and dun hide behind the shell...If u want to play this hunting game...I am game.Sigh, but I have not started to hunt yet...maybe I will see how this thread goes...<br><br>Tommy<br>Thanks for being the hero. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">U have always been my ardent supporter and maybe my regret is before I leave this forum, is not able to meet my hero although I am in Singapore <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">But do keep in touck at rinoa@comic.com..U always never fail to make my day.<br><br>UbA<br>Thanks for speaking up for me..U have been a real fren to me..What ever malice remarks have been made is becos of ........U know. So let us not make this our topic of the day whenever we talk ok? We have a real life to lead and dun let this entail behind what we have left for today.<br><br>Proddy<br>U have hit the right nail, as always the wise advisor. Dun u feel that this forum has lost his sprituality and essence? Maybe it is time to move on and find out in the webster dictionary what is the meaning of the word 'forum'?<br><br>Snafu<br>Devil's advocate, How do u do? Thank u for being so faithful in this thread. And yes..u can grin like a chesire cat and say whatever u want, but remember ,I have my supporters to start with...and U can't bring me down with ur sarcasm.<br><br>Coco<br>My heroine and analyst.hmm what can I say? Are u really a newbie? Haha.only u know..but I like the way u have make the metaphors...I can give u a 5 star rating..? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Callan<br>Ha!U!...see what u have done????I tell u...

            <div class='col-md body'>CoCo<br><br>i must say that youÂ’re very analytical and mature for your tender age, if iÂ’m not wrong youÂ’re about 21, well you hinted that youÂ’re 21. i find it hard to believe that youÂ’re a newbie as you seem to have a good handle on almost everyone in this forum. if youÂ’re indeed a newbie, you must have spent a lot of time reading most of our older postings, especially mine,  since you seemed to know that i track people in this forum because i only used the phrases Â“i started trackingÂ” or Â“i began trackingÂ” when i was flaming twinkle in a particular thread and that was way back in March. i prefer to flirt in this forum rather than flame. i do not deny that i profile people from their posts, well thatÂ’s my hobby but even then thatÂ’s done in private and any deductions arrived are discussed in private mails, hardly in public.<br><br>your suggestion of motives covers pretty much most of the possibilities of why HumblePie wanted to flame Rinoa, for the actual reason, only HumblePie will know. do allow me to suggest one more possible reason, it could be that HumblePie just doesnÂ’t like Rinoa and in his/her honest opinion, he/she felt that Rinoa was not being really being humble and being the free forum that this is, sadly, he/she felt the need to highlight this fact to everyone and he/she does have the right to post what he/she wanted. if he/she had created a new nick to flame Rinoa, then thatÂ’s really underhanded but my advise to Rinoa would be that she be very careful with the people she knows for iÂ’m sure that HumblePie is someone close to her or at least privy to her latest news.<br><br><blockquote><br>Colette:<br>Catch the drift yet...if i am not wrong, you will put Sherlock Holmes to shame with your tireless tracking and deduction. It's rather easy to guess the primary motive in this crime...and another to guess the perp, or Criminals, as the Great Detective loved to mentioned<br></blockquote>are you insinuating what i think youÂ’re insinuating? believe me CoCo, if and when i want to or wish to flame someone, i will not nor need to do it behind a new nick nor get someone to aid me. surely you should know by now that iÂ’m arrogant and good enough to flame people or put them down using my own name?<br><br>by the way, one can only smear someoneÂ’s reputation when there are no facts to back up oneÂ’s statements, when one has supporting facts, one is merely stating the facts as one see it, no matter how unpopular or hurtful they are. and believe me, it would indeed be a sad sad day if one is penalised for being pretty and popular.</div>
