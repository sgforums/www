            <div class='col-md body'>humble detector no. 1 - u know u r not humble when u give more than enough information to prove a pt.For example, a discussion abt situation of having a mute bf, it would be out of topic to say-This Pierce Brosnan look-alike mute guy used sign language saying that I am gorgeous. Well,if love conquers all, you would have tolerated all other factors to spend your life with him<br><br>humble detector no. 2 - u know u r pretending to be humble when you acknowledge a fact and yet try to hide it.For example, someone gives a compliment thatyou look pretty in the photo, you reply back, stating that you are not photogenic.In other words you are trying to say that you look pretty fascinating in real life<br><br>humble detector no.3-you know you are out to impress when u make a trival thing become a huge "HOO HAA". Let's imagine a scenario here shall we?You go partying in a club like zouk perhaps?and you realised people keep hitting on you.You get kinda big headed because you know you have been getting enormous attention.But hey people, give me a break, isn't being picked up such a norm for us girls here?<br>its passe baby!!!~<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>humble detector no. 5 - You know you have a big head when you post to tell people you are very busy when you are in Singapore..  You have no time to meet forumites.  For example "Sorry to those whom wants to meet me but really I am so occupied for the moment, but there will be one outing before I leave end of the month..." when no one wants to meet you at all.<br><br>BTW: If you really can't find "real friends" maybe it's about time you ask yourself the big question "WHY????"</div>

Characters seen on the internet, may not be what the person seems like real life, got a lot of examples here, I shall not quote, who, as I RESPECT other ppl's own right and privacy. If someone doesn't have the courtesy to keep quiet, it jus goes to show how much "xiu yang" this person has...sigh...what a pity<br><br>If this thread is to flame this suppose "Rinoa", then u are wasting ur time, coz ppl who knoes her, will know that she is none of these things the somebody has quoted..and from my understanding of her, she'll not make any replies, y bother when none of these is true??? Personally feel that this whole thing is so childish...but, then again, i respect other ppl's right and privacy, however, I shall not do PERSONAL ATTACK here..forgive me but i do feel that its a pity that seems like sgforums is becoming an attack society rather then speak rights. And having the freedom to speak, and to flame someone openly is different. One is expressing point of personal view, no offense and flaming is personal privacy attack...<br><br>I know that by speaking up here, I'm going to get some flaming, but shrieks~! RINOA IS MY REAL FRIEND!!! She is not a person without true friends, how do u think I survive with her thru thicks and thin for the pass 5 yrs had she been this kind of person..I think u shd at least try to get to know her, PERSONALLY, and in real life to judge her character, otherwise, I think the someone shd jus  be quiet and look whos talking, a pot calling a kettle who is not black!!<br><br>sighhh....<br><br>[This message has been edited by UgLy BuT AdOrabLe (edited 06 June 2000).]</div>

People are allow to voice their own opinion, let it be good or bad.  Different ppl have diff way of expressing themselves.  So, I will not say it is right or wrong, I am in no position to do so.<br><br>UBA: I know you are Rinoa's friend and you are very frustrated to see this happen to her.  I understand...but you have to notice that in all of what HumblePie said...all the quotes are from Rinoa's previous posts...no words are put into her mouth...none at all...<br><br>I don't think it is right for you to criticize whether a person got respect or not, cuz this is a forum, if someone feel that they dislike something/someone they are allowed to voice themselves...plus if you have noticed, everything mentioned in HumblePie's posts are all from the forum, nothing too personal that Rinoa can't post herself, so therefore nothing too personal for HumblePie to reply =D<br><br>Just my humble opinion... *smile*<br><br>------------------<br>Float like a butterfly...Sting like a bee...<br><br>[This message has been edited by NaiveGirl (edited 07 June 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>humble detector no. 7 - You know you are not humble when you talk about your personal problems but on the other hand you are implying that many guys throw a big "HOO-HAA" over you without knowing the reason why.

With people like you, the forums will be a place to avoid. Coming in with another nick to criticized, tarnished and humiliated another forumite surely reflects your true character...why then the humble proposition?

A loser in real life.....that was my analysis when put to test. Seldom, was I wrong...or would you like a cross-analyse  what I have just stated?<br><br>[This message has been edited by Tommy (edited 07 June 2000).]</div>
