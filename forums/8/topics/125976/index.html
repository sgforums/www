            <div class='col-md body'>Han Hao,<br><br>You see, <strong>Gibbs Free Energy is a State Function</strong>.<br><br>Useful energy, or energy available to do work, is of central interest because there is never a shortage of useful work to be done, and usually an insufficiency of useful energy to do it. Chemical reactions can be made to do work, or to serve as pathways for the conversion of heat into work. Energy which is, or which can be, available to do useful work is called <strong>Gibbs free energy</strong> or more often simply <strong>free energy</strong>. Free energy is called Gibbs free energy and given the symbol G in honor of Josiah Willard Gibbs, a professor of chemistry at Harvard University who almost singlehandedly developed both the concept and the quantitative equations which describe it.<br><br><strong>Free energy</strong> is a <strong>state function </strong> because it is formally defined only in terms of state functions, the state functions enthalpy and entropy, and the state variable temperature. <strong>The definition of free energy is</strong>:<br><br>G = H - TS<br><br>In the above equation H is the enthalpy, S is the entropy, and T is the absolute temperature.<br><br>A change in free energy dG would then be given by dG = dH - d(TS). Since temperature is a state variable and entropy is a state function they are separable, and so dG = dH - TdS - SdT. However, at constant temperature the change in temperature dT is zero, so the term SdT is zero also. For any constant-temperature (isothermal) change, then dG = dH - TdS. Rearrangement of this equation gives, for larger changes, the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation:<br><br>DH = DG + TDS.<br><br>In a different section it was shown that TdS is an energy, the energy not available for doing work. The equation above therefore has the physical meaning<br><br>total energy available as heat = DG + energy not available for doing work<br><br>It therefore follows that DG must be the energy which is available for doing work. This free or available energy which can do useful work is then a most useful thing to know or to have.<br><br>The conventions of heat flow q are also those of enthalpy change. When DH is negative, heat is evolved (or given off) in the exothermic process or reaction, while when DH is positive, heat is absorbed in the endothermic process or reaction from the surroundings. Free energy change also follows the same conventions. When DG is negative, energy is evolved (given up) in the process or reaction and the change can do useful work on something else. This is a spontaneous process, and is sometimes called an exergonic (energy-giving) process. When DG is positive, energy is absorbed in the process or reaction and useful work must be done on the materials so that the reaction will occur. This is a nonspontaneous process, and is sometimes called an endergonic (energy-requiring) process.<br><br>To know more about chemical dynamics, goto this website:<br><br>http://www.psigate.ac.uk/newsite/reference/plambeck/chem2/ua102.html</div>
