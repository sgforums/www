Having religion doesn't mean you won't do bad things. Just look around the world and you will get what I mean.<br><br>You don't do good because you expected something out of it. Sure, most of us would want something in return, but if you can do it, why not? Just helping an old lady to pick up her fruits won't kill you, unless you have brittle bone disease. The old lady doesn't benefit from you, neither do you benefit from her.<br><br>Why would one wants to destruct themselves for no reason? Apart from psycological reasons which make one do so, nobody in their right frame of mind would do such things. Why would they want to destroy the world if they depend on it for survival? Remember, everything in nature is interlinked. Don't think that you can survive without them. If you want to try, kill everybody and everything in your own house and tell us what is the results. No doubt you can go outside and work, but you depend on others to give you work. You can setup your own business, but you depend on nature to give you the natural resources to build these equipment.</div>

You know what s my theory? There is no god. HOWEVER, if he exists then he must be a sadistic bastard. you know why?<br><br>He made us imperfect and punish us for that. He made some people to be born in<br>awkard situations where they MUST sin in order to survive, or they're simply influenced by the environment where they have no control at all.<br><br>even tho there are people i hate, i believe that everyone is innocent. god is the ultimate biatch. why do u still believe him? can tell me y?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A college student was in a philosophy class, where there was a class<br>discussion about whether or not God exists, The professor had the following<br>logic:<br><br>"Has anyone in this class heard God?" Nobody spoke.<br><br>"Has anyone in this class touched God?" Again, nobody spoke.<br><br>"Has anyone in this class seen God?" When nobody spoke for the third time,<br>he simply stated, "Then there is no God."<br><br>The student did not like the sound of this at all, and asked for permission<br>to speak. The professor granted it, and the student stood up and asked the<br>following questions of his classmates:<br><br>"Has anyone in this class heard our professor's brain?" Silence.<br><br>"Has anyone in this class touched our professor's brain?" Absolute silence.<br><br>"Has anyone in this class seen our professor's brain?" When nobody in the<br>class dared to speak, the student concluded, "Then, according  to our<br>professor's logic, it must be true that our professor has no brain!"<br><br>The student received an "A" in the class.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The problem with religion is that once you have decided that your life can't be lived without a God, you are then faced with the dilemma of deciding which God is the true God.  And in that decision, you will tend to choose the God that best represents your own interpretation of this world.<br><br>Besides, notions like salvation, damnation and eternal life kinda makes me wonder what and for who these religious people are really living their pious lives for.</div>
