Nobody spoke.<br><br>"Has anyone in this class touched God?" Again, nobody spoke.<br><br>"Has anyone in this class seen God?" When nobody spoke for the third time,<br>he simply stated, "Then there is no God."<br><br>The student did not like the sound of this at all, and asked for permission<br>to speak. The professor granted it, and the student stood up and asked the<br>following questions of his classmates:<br><br>"Has anyone in this class heard our professor's brain?" Silence.<br><br>"Has anyone in this class touched our professor's brain?" Absolute silence.<br><br>"Has anyone in this class seen our professor's brain?" When nobody in the<br>class dared to speak, the student concluded, "Then, according  to our<br>professor's logic, it must be true that our professor has no brain!"<br><br>The student received an "A" in the class.</div></blockquote>However, if we crack open the professor's head, we would see a brain inside.

Ultimately, you believe in a religion because it assuages your fears about what comes after death.<br><br>Everybody would like to believe that there's something more to life than what is transcient, and I hope there is too.  But in holding on to that hope, should I subscribe to archaic indoctrination that preys on people's emotions and fears by offering eternal life and salvation?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have met people who are so obsessed with religion that they cant judge properly. These people follow blindly, they used sentences like "praise the Lord" or "thanks GOD", sometimes I do wonder whether they really meant it or just want to show other people how devouted they are. No point saying these sentences all the time and yet sin at the same time. I have got a friend who is a member of a certain church who donated 3/4 of his salary and the fact is he just starting working.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
