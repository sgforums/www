            <div class='col-md body'>When a person is at his critical stage of some terminal illness, do you think he should be aware of his condition (ie. he is going to die anytime)?  Or do you think he should only hear what he wants to hear?<br><br>I went to a hospice to see a person.  I was tempted to tell this person "Pls take good care of yourself.  Once you have recovered, I bring you some good food".  But I was told not to say it cuz the hospice person wants this patient to be aware that her physical body has stopped functioning and be drawn closer to the spiritual stuff.  (Note : this hospice is Buddhist based and the hospice person is some Buddhist shifu or shi xiong).<br><br>After that I shared this with a free thinker friend.  He cursed the hospice and said "How could they tell the patient that she's dying?!?!?"<br><br>So what you all think har?  Which is better for the dying person?   To tell or dun tell?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Depends, some patients (especially in geriartrics) will want you to be open-minded with them and let them know about their condition. Others are smart enough to pluck their charts or medical notes up and read, if they have the strength of course...<br><br>As for me, the release of information would come in handy only when the patient wants to know, and does not want you to hide any truth from him. Sometimes, the relatives may tell you not to tell the patient itself, it really depends on a whole lot of factors. Anyhow, as long as you do what you think is right for you and mostly the right of the patient and his request, I think you will do fine...</div>

He/She knows something is wrong with their body, but does not actually knows the point till death.<br><br>It's GOOD to tell the person if he/she is reglious or open mind, cause he/she will prepare himself/herself for the condition of death &amp; not to be scared or dewilded. Buddhist knows to be scared it's harder to reborn into better conditions.<br><br>It's BAD if that person is already very "negative" to tell him/her. Cause negative person will generate more negative thoughts by hearing this.<br><br>So you see, it all for the goodness of the dying. To enable himself/herself to prepare better for the following steps. Only to tell the dying if you know him well.<br><br>Hope I have clear your doubt.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A few hours ago when I was with her, she kept wanting to stand up and walk.  Sighhhhh  Then she got upset when her request was not done.  She frowned and tried to raise the voice with her weak vocal.  She wanted to reasurre that her body can still function.  I didn't want to tell her that she could no longer stand nor walk... I mean I really dunno how to tell her.  Luckily just then, the social worker came in, as usual to check on the patient.  I told her what just happened.  She said she was aware cuz the patient was requesting this whole night long on the day before.<br><br>Then the social worker decided to let her go for a walk... on a wheelchair (one of those with seatbelt and high back one, specially for very weak/ill patients).  The social worker kept repeating to the patient that the latter has extremely low blood pressure and the stroll was going to be quite risky for her condition (Her heartbeat could stop anytime if we brought her out).  The patient kept nodding her head.<br><br>Is this a sign that she doesn't want to die, cannot let go or cannot accept the fact that she's dying?</div>
