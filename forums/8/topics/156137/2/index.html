Or do you think he should only hear what he wants to hear?<br><br>I went to a hospice to see a person.  I was tempted to tell this person "Pls take good care of yourself.  Once you have recovered, I bring you some good food".  But I was told not to say it cuz the hospice person wants this patient to be aware that her physical body has stopped functioning and be drawn closer to the spiritual stuff.  (Note : this hospice is Buddhist based and the hospice person is some Buddhist shifu or shi xiong).<br><br>After that I shared this with a free thinker friend.  He cursed the hospice and said "How could they tell the patient that she's dying?!?!?"<br><br>So what you all think har?  Which is better for the dying person?   To tell or dun tell?  </div></blockquote>It depends...if I like the person then I lie for the happiness of that person. IF I don't really like the person, I'll tell the truth so that the person can live out their remaining days in constant fear and worries. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Sometimes you've to lie to the one you like/love cos you don't wanna hurt them, cos honestly doesn't pays in working life and relationship.
