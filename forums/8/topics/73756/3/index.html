If you have done event organising, you would see the difference in the price they quote for weddings and corporate events... cos ultimately, there is little difference in the equipment required such as no. of screens, projectors, etc... kekeke better yet.. get to know friends working in the hotel business... then you may be able to find out how much they actually mark up to con couples... kekeke</div>

After all with combined income, couples can at least have a more stable nest.</div>
