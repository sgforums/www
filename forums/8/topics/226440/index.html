            <div class='col-md body'>There is this news paper article submitted by someone that says The sportsman who goes to DOHA win medal get too much money!!!! The person seems to think that giving monetary reward will discourage sportsmenship...<br><br>I think the person should wake up his bloody mind!!! These sports man spent 10-20 years of their life since young to train... deprived of much enjoyment and gone through sh-it to train 4-7 days a week... and their career last only about 10-15 years... for the pride of our country... After these ever wonder where they will be working as? How much is $250,000 for a life of such hardship?<br><br>Is because of people like that in SG that's why Singapore will never get into world cup and gold in olympics.. he/she just wish the money is spend on his/her social welfare right?</div>

I think these sportsman gave their all... this is just a small token of appreciation...  $250k can help alot of poor families... but frankly Singapore government despite giving that much still does has the abilities to help these families... I think these people do us proud why not give it to them what they deserve. Afterall its their blood and sweat money.... Don't you feel proud if you go oversea people know recognise you as they know someone in your country who is the best in certain sports?<br><br>When I talk to a PRC bout his country to have quite a bit of a sportsman... he was quite proud about it... when I talke to a brit about soccer he was so proud with his english soccer.... And about Singapore....? Nothing to talk about... S league went down the drain... even humans at times need some ego fruit and spiritual aspect(or phsycholical aspect for athetist sake) to live.. man live on hope... We can be proud of our economy and clean and effective government... our army to protect us in times of war and why not sports?<br><br>At least for once I was quite proud that our Singapore team did beat the Malaysian 6 points lead in soccer... but that was years ago..</div>

I believe if just by for the small amount frankly to be truthful no one would spend an entire life doing this for a living... they need to have passion to train that way every day of the week... $250,000 frankly isn't alot in Singapore...</div>
