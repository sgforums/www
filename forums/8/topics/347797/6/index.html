              <p>when I was in primary I forgot which level perhaps 4 or 5</p>
              <p>There was this girl named Laura who was very very quiet. I mean she hardly spoke anything at all and when she did her voice would be soooooo tiny I could barely hear her.</p>
              <p>So I decided I wanted to see how loud she could speak. I pinched her in her arm I mean really tiny pinch that hurts. I did this occasionaly just so that she would say a word or something or even scream at me. She would grin but hardly uttered a word....(shame on me but hey I was a kid)</p>
              <p>Now I feel ashamed and I feel bad about how I acted towards her. I'm now 29 years old.</p>
              <p>Forgive me Laura and be assured I've paid my sins against you. lol. Whereever you are.</p>

              <p>I just searched trhough friendster...88 pages of Laura from my hometown. I give up after couple pages. It's just too daunting. I don't know her family name. Facebook won't even allow me to search unless I became a member. And I doubt I would be able to recognize her in her late 20s now.</p>
