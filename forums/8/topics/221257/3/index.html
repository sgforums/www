            <div class='col-md body'>I think the wife is at fault. She should have told her husband before marriage that she dislikes sex and does not want to engage in it. And if the husband is fine with it and still went ahead to marry her then it will be the husband's fault when things like this happened. Otherwise, it's all the wife's fault.<br><br>We all know that marriage will most probably lead to having children in future (of course it's not necessary). And it involves having natural sex. (do not come and tell me about test tube babies). This is kinda common sense. It's ridiculous if the wife is not aware of this. If she loves him, she would have told him...<br><br>I will divorce her asap if i'm her husband.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I find it odd that some people seem to think that love and sex are exclusive. The most intimate and passionate relationships are those where these two factors are in harmony.<br><br>Personally, I am slightly bias against the husband, as his method of getting his wife to have sex with him makes it seem to her that it's an obligation, and not something to be enjoyed. It is important for us men to continue treating our wives like a treasured girlfriend even after our marriage to keep romance and things fresh. Of course, the opposite has to be done as well from the wife's perspective for a marriage filled with sparks and which isn't one sided.</div>

The least she could do to help the marriage is to seek professional help, counselling or see a doctor.<br><br>Having said that, im not condoning the husband's behaviour.  He is obviously wrong for raping.</div>
