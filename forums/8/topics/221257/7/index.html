            <div class='col-md body'>from wat i learnt last time, frigidity is actually a mental disorder, and also a sexual disorder...<br><br>the wife shud have discussed with the husband before they got married that she has this disorder...and if her husband accepted that during that time, the woman is not in wrong. It should be the husband's fault for going back on his words, he should have considered this carefully before marrying her...<br><br>Maybe should bring the wife for a therapy or something, so that slowly she can see sex as something that happens naturally between a couple, not something dirty and forbidden...</div>
