It is just like saying it is ok for  men who whack their wives in marriage- after that they sayang sayang and the poor woman thinks it is her who is at fault  and he is a good husband since he is not sleeping with other women and buys her anything she wants .  Abuse - sexual or physical, is still abuse.<br><br>Sexual abuse is one crime where most people blames the victim and not the perpertrator .<br><br>The way I see it - if it happens to a loved one like your sister ...you will be singing a different tune .<br><br>He had the choice to annull the marriage - he has the choice to divorce her . Instead he CHOSE to rape her. In fact I don't even blame her for hating her child (pity the kid but such is life)  - it was by her husband's choice that he is to be blamed for this predicament and he is the one to be blamed .

If like that, the man should become monk already. I agreed that the wife has some serious mental problems and need to undergo therapy. I feel sad for the man.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> </div></blockquote>We are not saying it is normal not to have sex in a marriage.  Rather, even in a marriage, sex must be with consent (includes rape roleplay).  But if you think your wife cannot and refuse to satisfy you, it is still wrong to rape her.  You can of cos annul the marriage or divorce her.<br><br>Turn the table around.  If it is a woman complaining husband cant and refuse to satisfy her in bed, you think it is right for her to satisfy her appetite outside?  No right?  What she can do, after exhausting all other means, is divorce.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>wife is also human. Treat wife and all people with decency. Do not automatically assume that under marriage, the wife's rights are subjugated by the husband.<br><br>Love and Sex are 2 different things. She prove it by still loving her husband even after all the nasty things he did. She just didn't like the sex part which can be slowly fixed or accepted as it is. Husband can play a part and go counselling with her and husband can also learn more about her. There are other means to be intimate. Forcing another person is just not right. Its like telling someone their whole life is wrong and the woman must change just to fit the guy.<br>If that's the case, the women might as well stay single. Having a guy who rape you is very very bad. Have a child cause of the rape is even worse.<br></div>
