            <div class='col-md body'>HE says he sometimes feels like he is 'a monster' when his wife rejects his advances.<br><br>Yet, he insists that he has not done anything against his conscience.<br><br>When contacted for his side of the story, the 41-year-old owner of a provision shop said: 'I don't see what I did was wrong.<br><br>'I'm her lawful husband and with that, comes my right to expect sex. That's normal.'<br><br>'I knew she came from a traditional family background where sex was a taboo subject. So despite being tempted, we never went that far when we were dating,' he said.<br><br>He said he did not expect things to turn so ugly.<br><br>When his wife complained about asthma, he said he even consulted the family doctor who said it was fine for someone who is asthmatic to have regular sex.<br><br>He admitted that his feeling of hurt by constant rejection soon turned to fury.<br><br>'I felt so insulted. She would have this look of absolute disgust on her face when I touched her.<br><br>'Of course, I was furious. How do you expect me to react?'<br><br>Despite this, he claimed he had never looked at other women.<br><br>'If I wanted to, I could.<br><br>'But I don't do that because our marriage is still sacred to me.<br><br>'So what did I do wrong?'<br><br>LOST HIS MIND<br><br>As for the alleged violence and forced sex during the period when the PPO was issued, he said: 'I lost my mind because I was confused.<br><br>'She did not not leave our marital home. She even shared the same bed with me.<br><br>'I thought she was merely venting her anger when she applied for the order.'<br><br>He is aware of her conflicting emotions over their son.<br><br>'I want our marriage to work too. I still love her,' he said.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Hubby can be charged with rape under new law<br><br>MADAM Lim would have a case against her husband if he still attacks her after the proposed law on marital rape comes into force.<br><br>Under the impending changes to the criminal law in Penal Code, a husband can be charged with rape of his wife if she has indicated formally that she wishes to draw a line with him when it comes to sexual matters.<br><br>This happens when the wife is legally separated from her husband or when she has applied for a court order to bar the husband from assaulting her.<br><br>When contacted, lawyers noted that a balance had to be struck between protecting the wives and also the husbands, who could be framed by allegations of rape by estranged wives out for vengeance.<br><br>That's why a report on marital rape can only stand after the wife makes her intention clear through formal application.<br><br>CAN'T BE BACKDATED<br><br>In Madam Lim's case, she would not have been able to bring charges of rape against her husband for the earlier incidents because the proposed legal changes are unlikely to be backdated.<br><br>However, lawyer Nicholas Cheong noted that if she wished to, she would still have a case now, by claiming that her husband had breached the protection order by attacking her.<br><br>'Her spouse would likely face a jail term,' he said.<br><br>While court prosecution may be an option, counsellors like Ms Adeline Goh preferred the softer approach, especially when the parties still want to salvage the marriage.<br><br>'This may be better if it is an isolated incident and the marriage is not beyond rescue,' she said.<br><br>She added that a woman's repulsion of sex, such as in Madam Lim's case, could sometimes be due to a medical condition that could be treated.<br><br>'The situation could have been arrested if she had sought professional help. She was not only suffering from insecurity and the fear that her marriage was breaking down, she also had a medical condition that she was not aware of,' she said.<br><br>She was referring to a condition that causes some women to experience pain during sex.<br><br>Psychologist Danny Khoo said: 'In her case, she may feel powerless and that she has an obligation to fulfil. She probably worries about how people may look at her like she's at fault.<br><br>'She can make up her mind if she wants to leave that 'guilt', or if she wants to give the marriage another chance. It's also important for her husband to be involved in the counselling.'<br><br>This is something that her husband is open to.<br><br>He said: 'I have seen Ms Goh twice. Meanwhile, I'm also trying to control myself.'<br><br>In the end, it boils down to how men and women view the importance of sex in a relationship.<br><br>Mr Khoo, who has counselled many women who are fearful of having sex with their husbands, said: 'To the man, it's 'give me sex and I'd show you love' but to the woman, it's 'show me love and I'd give you sex'.'<br><br></div>

Husband had a <strong> CHOICE </strong>  to divorce or annul the marriage or just talking to her . Don't tell me some of you who pity the husband would do what he did if your future wives said no to sex?  The issue is that he raped her. No matter how nice he is to her - He still <strong> RAPED </strong> her.<br><br>It is like paedophiles being nice to the kid - giving them lollipops and all the goodies, then sexually abusing them  ...are you going to say BUT HE IS SO NICE .....so it is the child's fault?

Can you sue her or divorce her without needing to give 50% of your assets to her.<br>Cause i know that in US you can sue your wife for not having sex with you.</div></blockquote>If you go for divorce you will lose 50%. If she has never agreed to have sex with you after marriage, you should not force yourself on her. Instead you can apply to the courts for an annulment of marriage on the grounds of non-consummation...no need for maintenance then because there is no divorce.<br><br>It's true that sex is an integral part of the marriage contract....I don't think it has been tested in our courts though...should be interesting if someone sues his wife for breach of contract.<br><br>Until the recent change in the law, there is no rape within marriage under common law and it was not illegal for the husband to force himself on his legal wife. It will be illegal if he repeats it in future.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seems to be alot of people on here feeling sorry for the wife. In no way do i condone rape. In fact i think its one of the few things in this world which is worthy of twenty-four strokes of the cane. She needs help. She doesnt see herself having a problem at all. It is not normal. He was wrong to rape her, but she needs to understand that there is something wrong with totally not wanting sex..... Unless maybe you're like 147 years old or something</div>

I dont know what you guys have but we have public campaign here to incourgae women to report abusive relationships such as this.<br><br>However having said that i am absolutely confused what the reporter is trying to tell us. Is this a mental health article outlining depression and such? abusive relationships? or what? Yeah sad story but the woman doesnt seem to be in a"trapped" relationship.<br><br>Clearly this woman has a mental health problem of some kind before the "rape" already. And shes probably suffering post natal depression which is why she hates her child so. Some woman in "normal" relationships do feel like "killing" their own children because of the new pressures and depression after birth.</div>
