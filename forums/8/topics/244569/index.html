            <div class='col-md body'>so poor thing, do u feel pitiful for her?<br><br>she was molested when she was 6, but realized she was being molested only years later and then became depressed n self multilated herself.<br><br>but lucky she had the support of her church friends and then she channeled her energy to being a counsellor at CHC.<br><br>http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/printfriendly/0,4139,125600,00.html<br><br>[QUOTE]<br><br>SUN HO'S PAINFUL REVELATION:<br><br>'I was molested at 6'I knew something was wrong<br><br>SINGER Sun Ho's own youthful struggles with depression and self-mutilation is no secret.By Ho Lian-Yi25 March 2007<br><br>SINGER Sun Ho's own youthful struggles with depression and self-mutilation is no secret.<br><br>But she has never revealed what triggered them.<br><br>It was a secret she kept even from her own mother.<br><br>Finally, two days ago, at a Taipei press event, she revealed the truth.<br><br>Sun (left) said that she was sexually abused as a child by a man whom she knew. She was only 6.<br><br>'I don't remember what he was like...' she told The New Paper from Taipei.<br><br>The molest happened at his house when she was there playing with her siblings.<br><br>The man asked her to sit on her lap. Afterwards, she felt a 'pain'.<br><br>'I couldn't fully comprehend what had happened, but I knew something was wrong,' she said.<br><br>She tried telling her mother it hurt, but had no way to express fully her predicament.<br><br>So she kept it in her heart.<br><br>But that experience left Sun, now 36, with scars.<br><br>As she grew older, and began to understand what happened, she grew angry.<br><br>'How could someone I trusted do something like this to me?' she said.<br><br>Worse, she started blaming herself.<br><br>Why did she not resist the man, she asked herself.<br><br>The teenage Sun spiralled into depression, which worsened into self-mutilation. She would use a razor to cut her own hands, and even lock herself in her room.<br><br>As a 16-year-old, the only people she confided in were her close group of friends, who were all Christians.<br><br>They told her to forgive herself. And finding religion helped her see the light.<br><br>'How could a 6-year-old have protected herself?' she asked.<br><br>It was her experience that led her to start a welfare centre at City Harvest Church later and become a counsellor, to help other victims.<br><br>She has even forgiven the man. She said she lost touch with him since her family moved when she was 9.<br><br>And her husband, City Harvest Church founder, Kong Hee, was a source of strength. They have a 2-year-old son, Dayan.<br><br>'He always tells me, look, what you have gone through has given you the strength to help many people,' she said.<br><br>But one fear remained - her mother did not know.<br><br>Then, she revealed her story to the Taiwanese press while promoting her new album Embrace. She was hoping her story would help fellow victims.<br><br>'My first reaction was, I hope this doesn't go back to Singapore,' she said.<br><br>She hadn't kept her mum in the dark because she thought her mum would be ashamed of her.<br><br>Then she found out a local Chinese paper was breaking the news yesterday. The paper quoted an inaccurate Taiwanese report that said she had been molested for five years.<br><br>As she was unable to get her mum, she called her husband to tell her mum before the news broke. Luckily, he managed to do so. But she was still crushed.<br><br>'I never told her because I knew she would have a meltdown - which she did tonight,' she said.<br><br>She said her mum called her, crying and admonishing herself for being a terrible mother. Sun's voice cracked several times on the phone. She was crying too.<br><br>'I want to tell her, it had nothing to do with her. There was nothing she could do. I am a mother now too. I know there is no way you can spend 24/7 with a child,' she said.<br><br>[/QUOTE]<br></div>
