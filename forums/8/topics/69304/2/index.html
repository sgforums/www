            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm... the real reason given to why so many do not want to have kids is that they are in fact, kids deep down themselves. The term I believe, is "kidults", people who refuse to outgrow their childhood.<br><br>There's nothing wrong with indulging your inner child, but from some of the views and reasons given on why they don't like kids, it's apparent a lot of people are still pretty much immature when it comes to their mental maturity, possibly a result of our protected upbringing.</div>

In the<br>modern world, however, there is no longer any<br>need - not just yet anyway.<br><br>According to research to be published next<br>month, young adults in Britain and America<br>are clinging to the freedom of their teenage<br>years for longer than ever before, and the<br>pressure to set up a home and start a family is<br>now a thing of the past.<br><br>Stephen Richardson, a British social<br>psychologist based in San Diego, California,<br>claims that passing the 21-year-old threshold<br>no longer implies adulthood, and that the<br>crucial age is now as old as 35.<br><br>The determination to extend the fun years as<br>long as possible is epitomised by celebrity<br>party-goers like Tara Palmer-Tomkinson who,<br>at the age of 30, is showing no sign of settling<br>down. However, it is not only the famous who<br>want the good times to continue to roll.<br><br>In his report - The Young West: How We Are<br>All Growing Older More Slowly - Mr<br>Richardson found young adults tended to stay<br>with their parents instead of buying their own<br>home.<br><br>They spent their money on consumer goods<br>such as computers, music systems, and<br>accessories.<br><br>The study involved nearly 200 people, mostly<br>graduates aged between 20 and 40, whose<br>lifestyles were tracked over a five-year period.<br>It found that marriage and parenthood were<br>also being delayed, leading to what Dr<br>Richardson, a 39-year-old Cambridge<br>graduate, describes as a generation of<br>"fledgling" adults, who only reach full maturity<br>at the age of 35.<br><br>"Culturally and psychologically, they become<br>what previous generations recognised as fully<br>formed adults," he said.<br><br>"Few of us, and I include myself among them,<br>really get there before that."<br><br>David Marshall, a 29-year-old engineer from<br>Lanark, is one of the increasing number of<br>young people determined not to get sucked<br>into the responsibilities of adulthood too<br>quickly.<br><br>He rents a flat in Glasgow, the city where he<br>works, which he shares with two like-minded<br>friends.<br><br>He gained a degree in mechanical<br>engineering from Nottingham University in<br>1995 and then spent a year travelling round<br>the world, visiting countries such as Thailand,<br>Australia, and America. He now works full-time<br>as an engineer in Glasgow.<br><br>He said: "When I was travelling, I said I would<br>never do a nine-to-five job but I got sucked into<br>it to a certain extent. Even so, I just see it as a<br>means to an end."<br><br>That "end" is enjoying life, as far as David is<br>concerned. Last weekend, he went shopping<br>with his friends and blew<br>Â£100 on a new<br>steering wheel for their PlayStation - with no<br>regrets.<br><br>"If we have got money, we go out and buy toys.<br><br>"I do take my job very seriously and I work hard<br>while I am at work but my free time is my own."<br><br>So what about the future? David certainly has<br>plans but they have little to do with mortgages<br>or taking on any more responsibility.<br><br>He said that, in a few years time, he hoped to<br>spend a season working abroad in a<br>snow-boarding resort, which would enable him<br>to combine work with one of his favourite<br>sports.<br><br>"I would hate to get to 40 and think 'I wish I had<br>done that when I was young'," he said.<br><br>"I know people in their 20s who are married<br>with children and they are just limiting their<br>options.<br><br>"I have no intention of getting married in the<br>next wee while. I tend to play it day by day - I<br>don't have any long-term plans."<br><br>The trend towards young people delaying their<br>first foray into home ownership is recognised<br>by Stewart McIntosh, a freelance property<br>journalist in Glasgow.<br><br>He said: "People are staying at home for<br>longer, largely because of changes in social<br>values and the debts that people accumulate<br>at university.<br><br>"There is also more pressure on people to buy<br>cars, which they often need for work, and to be<br>better dressed if they work in an office. People<br>also want to travel and there are more leisure<br>activities that they want to spend their money<br>on."<br><br>Paul Freathy, professor of retail management<br>at the Institute for Retail Studies at Stirling<br>University, feels that it is impossible to<br>compare the lifestyles of today's young adults<br>and that of their parents or grandparents<br>without taking into account the huge changes<br>in society over that time.<br><br>He said: "Comparisons of young people today<br>with those 20 or 30 years ago are spurious to<br>be honest. The amount of disposable income<br>young people have nowadays would be<br>unimaginable then.<br><br>"You now have the dual income, no children<br>phenomenon, which means retail trends are all<br>about saving time, rather than saving money.<br><br>"People are also better educated, better<br>travelled, and have more choices."<br><br></div>
