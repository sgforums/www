              <p>There is nothing wrong with an abnormally-low birth rate. This is a good thing. It means less suffering.</p>
              <p>I strongly believe any male who has never been non-single, should continue to remain single for the rest of his life. Also, he should remain free of any offspring -- biological or adopted. This will help prevent the suffering of sweet boys -- like Chen -- as well as the existence of bitter girls -- like Xinyi.</p>
              <p>To prevent future calamities for my potential offspring, I plan to remain single and offspring-free for the rest of my life. I suggest other males do the same until society is forced to mandate that children be treated in a genderless manner.</p>
              <p>Maybe I need to brainwash other men into remaining virgins and offspring-free. It would be an excellent idea to tap into the average man's subconscious and scare him to the core about the horrors of relationships-gone-wrong and the abuse his children could possibly suffer in the hands of evil society.</p>

              <p>To prevent future calamities for my potential offspring, I plan
              to remain single and offspring-free for the rest of my life. I
              suggest other males do the same until society is forced to mandate
              that children be treated in a genderless manner.</p>
              <p>Maybe I need to brainwash other men into remaining virgins and
              offspring-free. It would be an excellent idea to tap into the
              average man's subconscious and scare him to the core about the
              horrors of relationships-gone-wrong and the abuse his children
              could possibly suffer in the hands of evil society.</p>

              <p>Perhaps there is psychological reason for the lack of births in Singapore. Stop the socially-motivated, gender-biased abuse of boy-children, and more will be accepting of the idea of having children.</p>
              <p>I can easily empathize with SG natives NOT wanting to have children. The men of society [including in the culture of Singapore] are very abusive of boy-children and irrationally-protective of girl-children. I know that my son will end up being victimized by society and my daughter will be one of the bullies of society who abuses boys. For this reason, I choose NOT to have children.</p>
              <p>I want all boy-children to be as safe as possible from society's evil gender stereotypes. However, I have NO hint of care for girl-children. If I had a son, my protective feelings toward him would be overwhelming. I'd want to burn anyone who touched him. On the other hand, if I had a daugher, I'd have no feelings for her and wouldn't care about her at all. Due to these reasons, I don't want children of any gender.</p>
              <p>I believe in protecting the underdog and punishing the bully.</p>
