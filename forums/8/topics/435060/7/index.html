              <p>The govt is running this place like a company, companies buy ready make talents and peoples to replace the old or unskill people, because to recruit from the base, it takes time and lots of effort, and it may not even get the right result.</p>
              <p>Our Govt and our country, singapore, my second home, is still a very young country, the govt in view of wanting to excel in economy and money, cannot afford to wait for the lower birthrate to go back to normal, they had long give up the notion of supporting birthrate increases after the last package gift of 18 k see no light at the end of the tunnel,</p>
              <p>"If singaporean do not want to give birth, which the govt cannot help much, so be it, we shall have to import foreigners in to supplment the shortage inorder to maintain and at the same time, improve our economy so that all of us will have jobs, good jobs" LHL in the early ND rally speech.</p>
              <p>The matter here is, nobody challenged his speech then, no objection, instead all clapped hand and approved on it. But in my view, the govt had not done enough to promote birthrate, and by instilling more Fs in, it make the matter worse instead of improving on it. The true is, they have totally ignore and do not bother about low birthrate of singaporean anymore, it all up to you.</p>

              <p>I believe that there is not much that can be done in terms of increasing birth rate....for the very simple reason that there is no space.</p>
              <p>Singapore is a small city-state.....it is already very crowded and is very high density, highly urbanised, and it is also a mature economy.</p>
              <p>There is not enough land..........if the population keeps growing, where will the people go to ? Pulau Ubin..?</p>
              <p>Because the land is scarce.......the price of land is higher and higher....and because the price of land is higher, price of property is higher, and that puts a dampener on young couples ability to marry and procreate......and this problem is compounded with the fact that Singapore is a mature service economy, there is no oil, no gas.......because it is a mature service economy, high living standards, many households have 2 income (husband and wife) nowadays it is rare that a young couple can rely only on husband's income, most young women go out to work.</p>
              <p>Nothing can be done......birth rate will naturally increase when the population shrink to more sustainable level.</p>

              <p>i think the best thing is not to give baby bonus, but to give reduced tax rate. like the parents have 10% discount on 1st child, 2nd child 30%, 3rd child 50%, 4th child 60%, 5th child 80%, 6th child 100%, 7th child and so on gets $200 monthly.</p>
              <p>must give such scheme to existing children under 18.</p>

              <p>Had similar topic same time last year.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I proposed this solution:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>=================================================================</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div id="post-body-10169903" class="body">
              <p>Solving the low birth rate is quite easy and well within the government's means.</p>
              <p>( Btw, increasing the birth rate means increasing the Singaporean CHINESE birth rate, as the Malays are reproducing quite happily, thank you very much. No studying for them- too busy baby making to study ;)  )</p>
              <p>Basically you give a lot more money.</p>
              <p>The current baby bonus is quite low- $4000 to 6000. Even Australia gives roughly twice as much.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is what I propose.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For the next 3 years, every second baby onwards results in $500,000 being given to the parents, under the following conditions:</p>
              <p>1. Parents are married at least 2 years.</p>
              <p>2. Parents have degrees. (this can be modified to include poly tech diploma holders, but it's the Chinese who need to be encouraged remember?)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now last year, about 3,000 people were eligible under the baby bonus scheme. Usually about 36,000 to 40,000 babies are born each year.</p>
              <p>By offering to make instant  half millionaires of couples, this should triple or quadruple over the 3 years to around 120,000 babies per year.</p>
              <p>Can the Govt afford it?</p>
              <p>Hell yes.</p>
              <p>Say 80,000 of the 120,000 are 2nd or 3rd children (not 1st born)</p>
              <p>80,000 x $500,000 is $40 billion per year.</p>
              <p>Over 3 years is $120 billion.</p>
              <p>Currently Temasek has around $200 to 300 billion.</p>
              <p>Thus for a 3 year investment, they vastly increase the wealth of the Singaporean Chinese, they get huge increases in population in just 3 years- no need to give PR or citizenship to foreigners, and they will even increase the boys available for NS in the future.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Problem solved.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Does anyone else have any other solutions? :)</p>
