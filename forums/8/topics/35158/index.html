            <div class='col-md body'>One fan's bad experience<br><br>WHEN 15-year-old Claire Leong went home after an autograph session by Avril Lavigne (right), she was close to tears.<br><br>The Canadian teen pop sensation, who received a stunning five Grammy nominations Line is overdrawn this year, including one for Best New Artiste, held her first-ever autograph signing session at The Heeren last month.<br><br>Claire claimed that after waiting for nine hours, all she got was a shove and a scribble.<br><br>She said: 'The organisers didn't say we have to bring along an album and I was told only when it got to my turn. A woman pushed me and yelled 'Give others a chance' even though it was my first time in the queue!<br><br>'Luckily, my friend had extra CDs, so I managed to meet Avril.'<br><br>But that was when things got worse.<br><br>'I barely had a minute with her, she wouldn't even look up at me. She took the ring I bought for her and threw it into a black garbage bag.<br><br>'And all she wrote was an 'A' on the cover - that was her autograph! I was devastated.'<br><br>Her mother, Ms Angelia Koh, 51, a housewife, said she was 'so angry' when her daughter returned home.<br><br>Ms Kelly Chew, managing director of BMG Singapore, Lavigne's record company here, explained: 'We had only an hour and Avril signed nearly 800 autographs in that time.'<br><br>There were, by her estimates, about 3,000 people crowding around to catch a glimpse of Lavigne.<br><br>Ms Chew added that it was stated in the ads that you would need a CD to get an autograph.<br><br>She said Lavigne, 18, was 'frightened' by the huge turnout.<br><br>As for throwing the ring into a black garbage bag, Ms Chew said: 'We needed to store all the gifts in a plastic bag, because how else are we going to lug all the presents back?'<br><br>As for the pushing, she said about 20 security guards and 10 BMG staff members were on hand to maintain order. But the crowd ignored their repeated requests for orderly behaviour.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
