            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Firewall, think you make a good point regarding "stiffness" in the British system. Personally I'm pro-US. Feel that it really gives me lotsa flexibility in deciding what I really want to learn. I'm kinda choosing my courses based on what I foresee the future of technology is heading. This is a great advantage as I can fine tune myself and make myself more "marketable" when I go for my job search. Also, I get to learn from the best in the world in the field of technology. However there is one disadvantage associated with the US system as compared to the British system. In the US system, you really got to be motivated enough to take those challenging and useful classes. One could easily graduate from the US system by just choosing to take all those crap classes and that serves no purposes at all.<br><br>ps. why carnegie? carnegie mellon?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>nah....dun think he/she is from carnegie mellon....maybe from one of the uni of london colleges?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>anyways, i dunno of any survey company who does surveys from a forum! hope ur sample size is more than 4 man!<br><br>my comments: i see ur assuming s'poreans really do prefer american univs. i think this trend has become more marked only in recent years. there are still many (very good) jc students here with a hang-up over oxford and cambridge. they only think of those and the ivy league univs for their undergraduate education. but more and more students are preferring the states. i think it's partly due to better marketing, lower entry requirements and cheaper fees. of course the liberal arts thingey is a big draw. plus u can do a double degree in the same amt of time but not in the UK. u can even finish ur undergraduate plus master's in the same amt of time it takes to do just the former in the UK. but that's at the undergraduate level.<br><br>as for the graduate level (e.g. in the liberal arts, of which i am most familiar), u gotta blame both the academics and the graduate students. if u speak to ppl from australia to new zealand, from s'pore to timbucktoo, the academics and graduate students will encourage you to go to the states for ur graduate studies (and not just the ivy league ones. many state univs are really good too) cos the faculty there is top notch. think they bought over some of the very best british academics too! research facilities there too are very good. students want to work under first class reseachers and professors.<br><br>the graduate programmes in the states, tho very open and liberal, also require you to pass some core requirements. ppl prob see this as more thorough training. this is not always the case in britain (london colleges inclusive).<br><br>prob the most impt factor for a graduate student is financial aid. US univs give good support in terms of fellowships, teaching/research assistantships and so on. and you don't have to be a first class student to get one. what are impt are your GREs, writing samples and recommendations. the focus is on potential. not always so for UK univs. they don't seem to want international students and this you can tell from their (un)willingness to give out financial aid. quite honestly, the financial support is appalling. whatever happened to Blair saying that this issue would be redressed?<br><br>in terms of marketing to international students, just take a look at the web-sites of british vs american univs and you'll know the difference. for many british univs, u have to hunt high and low and all around for an international student's page that will give u info on course fees and financial support. the american univs put that info up front.<br><br>what makes a univ top notch is not just the faculty and their publications or research facilities but the quality of the graduate students. and US univs have been more open (and serious) abt taking in international students than UK univs, in my opinion.<br><br>in terms of reputation amongst academics, i think collectively, university of london is first class. and so are the IVY league univs. but ppl here still tend to think oxford and cambridge in the same breath as the latter. and seldom think too much of london colleges, until ppl who are in the know or who have studied there tell them they're really quite good.<br><br>the thing tho is this. at the graduate level at least, what is impt is the quality of the programme you are considering. NOT the overall reputation of the univ. some ivy league univs are comparatively weak in some of their programmes, and would not be first choice programmes for graduate study. in such cases, knowing that u received your training in a reputable department (even in a not-so-famous univ) and under top-quality faculty will get you further in the eyes of fellow academics and ppl in the industry. so the comparison at graduate level has to be made between programmes and not between ivy league and london colleges as a whole.<br><br>hope this helps.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

But theyr eally do have really good Unis if u r interested in these this type of field...just u won't be getting much done after u graduate...  and we all know that politicians always take their time when it comes to money right?...he he:-)sarcasm intended there...:-)<br><br>But yeah, ur post was really informative Star...I learned quite a bit from that..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>GTR, I kno u asked Star, but I'd like to comment also...if I may :-)<br><br>The guy must be lying thru his teeth...Well, as u kno i am from Usa...and My dad being british american, i have been to Britain before...Let me just say that the price of living is a bit higher than USA...and it really does add up...even at 1 dollars more for things, at the end of the month, u can add it up and want to vomit from the amount...:-)<br><br>The unis are also very cheap in comparison...especailly if u get financial aid...In the USA they have financial aid from 1 million and one sources...and a lot of them for really strange things also...I got financial aid when I was in uni there and my grades were really crap..just barely made it out of highschool...ha ha:-)  It was crap...but i got a $1000 or $2000 subsidy from the city for what i also don't know...:-)That's how ridiculous and easy it is to apply for aid there...:-)<br><br>Food is cheap, restaurants are cheap, clothing is inexpensive,...heck i eat at macDonalds here in Spore and i spend the equivilent of a good meal in a restaurant in the USA...:-)  GB being more expensive than Sing also...<br><br>As for working first, I think go ahead man...It's always good to get experience under ur belt before the degree(u will have an advantage even if only psychologically)...and about the not wanting to study again after working...u would be surprised...After u work for a while, u'll find that you'll be begging to study again...ha ha:-) vice versa...in school u beg to work..:-)<br><br>Ok that's all I gots to say...:-) take care and choose wisely..<br><br>Dil,<br><br>It's true about it being easy to slack in Uni in the States...Most of my friends there are taking slack classes(like that porn appreciation class, but they call it a more politically correct name now)...or some weird subject that's easy as pie...and it's very tempting to take those courses..especially if ur really the lazy type...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah, firewire, i agree it's quite sad what's happening in britain. i guess from what you've added, the researchers themselves must really be pissed and disheartened. what can i say? if ur serious abt education and all that, u gotta put more money into it man! if the UK is gonna be slow abt it (for whatever reason), then the damage will be done - image-wise - cos ppl will start thinking "US! US! US!". and impressions take a long time to change man.<br>the UK has to do sth fast else it's gonna lag even further behind. pity tho....cos they're a traditional power-house when it comes to research and academia.<br><br>GTR - well i'm no expert man. but the first thing i need to know is the course you're thinking of attending and ur future plans. if ur thinking of graduate studies in engineering or business or economics, then 2-3 yrs in a RELATED field of work would be good before a graduate degree. that's what my bro did and other ppl i know. u won't believe how useful that experience will be. and also a couple of yrs will give you the chance to reassess ur priorities. u'd also have matured more and believe u me, that helps in ur further studies. somehow you just see the bigger picture.<br><br>i assume u are thinking of taking a graduate degree to further your career? or do you wanna be an academic? if it's the latter, just make sure u really have the interest. that's the most impt. having a passion for the subject is vital.<br><br>if it's the former, well no real rush cos after working a while, you can assess ur priorities. hopes, plans and dreams change man. some love their job so much or are earning so darn much they dun wanna rock the boat. be that as it may then. if that's the case then don't go for studies. then u gotta think abt family man. do u have parents, siblings, gf, wife to take care of or think abt? cos if ur gonna bring gf along, it costs more man. and dun think u can just go to another country and find work just like that. think immigration can be quite strict on these things. and gfs may not wait for you forever. just something for you to consider and to weigh what is impt for you.<br><br>what i would advise u to do now if u know what graduate course u wanna take is to look up univs overseas. go to their web-sites, email the international student's association or whatever there to find out abt costs (including fees, living costs, accommodation, etc.) and any financial support. find out which univs are good for the course you wanna take and assess and compare the courses. many departments have their own graduate advisors. email them and discuss with them ur hopes and plans. or maybe the embassies here can help. it has to be hands-on work man. u gotta find the univ that best suits ur budget and ur goals. then be aware of entry requirements (in the US) like GREs or Toefls or GMATs (if ur a business student) or whatever. u have to sit for these. so work out for yourself what to do and when to do it by and note all application deadlines and then at least we'll be on our way.<br><br>hmmm.....i dunno abt UK being cheaper....<br>always thot it was more expensive, esp after the exchange rate thingey and the lack of funding. but some US univs are really expensive....usu the private univs and those in New York (bloody expensive place i heard). the state univs in the US are cheaper and generally have lotsa funding.<br>so you need to look at not just the type of univs in the US but also which State it is in (costs of living vary quite a bit). some courses too have more funding than others.<br><br>aust and nz are pretty much like UK. i have frens in aust on univ-sponsored scholarships. but to get one you really need a first-class honours degree. but maybe there are other sources of funding. u gotta look. but generally, in aust and nz, the support for international students isn't too good. this australian academic told me himself. said america has better financial support.<br><br>one piece of advice - as far as possible don't take a loan to study overseas. ur gonna pay thru ur arse when u return.<br><br>whatever it is, i think it'll be a great chance for you to get exposure to another country and culture. not one of my frens has regretted it. and some are even living and working in the states now. if for nothing else, i'd go for the adventure man! it's really a once in a lifetime kinda thing. and you're only young once.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>and i agree with firewire. once i started to work, it wasn't three months before i started thinking abt school again!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Might as well talk a bit about our local universities since i'm in one (NTU), at least Cambridge university's engineering faculty allows more flexibility by letting the students do common subjects in 2 years whereas NUS streams students within 1 semester n NTU, slightly better but to an extent, in a year. and what about 16 weeks of school here???? do they honestly think we can catch up in this period, any1 can enlighten me how the academic yr for engin courses in overseas uni is like ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
