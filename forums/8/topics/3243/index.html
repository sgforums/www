            <div class='col-md body'>gigalo, believe me when i tell you i am speaking from experience...<br><br>our reservists are the best force that we have...<br><br>in fact, the active NSFs are the ones that are not capable to fight in an operation.<br><br>The main thrust of the SAF is to train up a credible reserve force. NSFs are there just to train to enter the reserve ORBAT.<br><br>I have seen numerous reservists trainings and I can say they have a lot more maturity and comprehension of what they are doing than the active NSFs.<br><br>Furthermore, these reservists know that in a time of crisis, they are protecting their families and assets in Singapore..not duty honour nor country...<br><br>The bo chup attitude that you see are actually from the young reservists who barely ORDed 2 years ago...give them a little time, and the maturity will set in...<br><br>remember..the reservists ARE our fighting force...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When the reservists matured after some in-camps,i tend to agree that they are better than our NSFs as they are more matured in thinking and not always thinking of how to tuang as when they go back for in-camp,they are training to protect their wife,kids etc etc while a NSF's mentality is just training so can serve their 2 1/2 or 2 years and ORD only,so in this aspect,i can say that our reservists are quite good considering that they are reservists and an not active force  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">))</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I dun know about the rest of you....but I am from Armour and there are a thousand and one things to remember. Like what to check for in your vehicles, mounting the weapons and esp. now they come up with the new Bush-master wpn.....God!!! If you ask me now to strip and do IA drills, I doubt I can still remember. Compared to NSF who have training everyday in the wpn and doing maintainence checks, the only thing reservist have is experience. Reservist also tend to look for shortcuts at times and dun really follow everything to the book. I am not saying that it is a bad thing but at the same time, it is not a good thing also. Maybe reservist should have more training to brush up on their wpn handling, safety etc but this will make them grumble abit more also, esp. if you are earning alot per month.</div>
