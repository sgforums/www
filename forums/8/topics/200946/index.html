            <div class='col-md body'>National day is coming and everytime when this part of the year came, I can't help but feel sad. Sad because fewer and fewer citizen hung their flag outside their home. Why is it happening? I tried seaching for the answer but it came to notch. LOOK! We had steadily increase GDP, strong economic growth in that sense, 160k new jobs for the quarter. So whats holding back for them to hung out those flags? Busy? It couldn't be busy as it only takes less than a minute to put it up. Forgetful? Maybe but it couldn't be all.<br><br>The reason lies after I did a little survey with 100 citizens is that 66% of them love and adore our current leadership so much that some hung their flag in door and some rather keep it than dirty it through rain and shine. Please don't ask me to provide the names of the 100 citizens for obvious reason.<br><br>Yes, some citizen may be displease with some of our government policy but did they ever compare singapore with other countries like Utopia or Rwanda? We are so much luckier in that sense. Fares and Utilities bills have to go up unless someone can stop the cost of crude oil. We are lucky that unlike other countries whereby they subsidize the cost and spoon-feed their citizen in times of economic turmoil, singapore did just the opposite and allows the citizen the opportunity to do their duty as a citizen in bearing the brunt of the recession.<br><br>Singaporeans should not always be on the look out for hand-outs but learn to stand firm and strives along. Only then can we proclaim to come of age and go forth in times of economic turmoil. Only then can we give out more scholarship to foreign students so as to attract more foreign talent.<br><br>With promise of making each and every household to have lift stop at every level by 2011, we have a caring government unlike other countries who are wasting their time debating and tackling unimportant issues like recession and rising unemployment which can never be solved with rising crude oil.<br><br>Therefore I sincerely hope the remaining 33% of the citizen that took the survey will wake up and appreciate the beauty of our beloved government thinking and put on a happy face this coming national day.<br><br>As for me, I will definately look forward to 8th of August and salute to the aircraft carrying national flag flying past for I know my future lies with our flawless and respectful government.</div>
