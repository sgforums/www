            <div class='col-md body'>When you recieve flowers on a ordinary day and when you recieve flowers on valentines day, the feeling is different..on valentines day, yes you can be romantic on any days, but on this particular day, it is more meaningful as its the day for you to celebrate your love with the one you love. Just like why we celebrate Mother's day or national day,it add up spices to our life   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>The  greatest regrets in our lives are the risks we did not take.

If you<br>think  something will make you happy, go for it. Remember that we pass this way only  once.<br>Bottomline :<br>Time don't wait. If you think you might have found the  right one, treasure him/her. Don't let he/she go away. Don't let fear hold you  back.<br>Give it a try else you might regret later... No one other than  yourself<br>knows what can truly make you  happy.</div>
