            <div class='col-md body'>Few threads ago there were people announcing their badness (complete with evil laughter etc) and as the result, there was an outpouring of sympathy, I-know-you-better-than-that's and followers who announced themselves to be as bad.  These happened despite the fact that those who proclaimed themselves bad do as bad does, everyone is then pleased with his/her own level of understanding of others.<br><br>On the other hand, if someone has a bad persona in the forums without announcing that it's fake or make it too exaggerated to feel fake, insults, stones and sticks rain on the person.  How do you know that he's just playing around as well?<br><br>I failed to do it just now, but I'll tell you what I do next time someone pisses me off in this forums.  I am going to count to 10 and see if the irritation disappear.

            <div class='col-md body'>dear readers,<br><br>if i did sounded pissed, that was unintentional.  actually i want to discuss this phenomenon: announce that you are bad in such a manner and proceed to be bad, and a whole row of people will rally for you. don't bother with any announcement and just be bad, even if it's as fake as the first group's bad, and people get pissed with you.<br><br>so actually when you announce your badness, do you know that support is the result and therefore you insist that you are bad (for example, i told a friend that i'm slutty and bitchy and quickly she said that it's my high spirit, even when i insisted that i don't mind being labelled bitchy and stuff).  was i just trying to gather sympathy for myself then or it's just one of those things that people always misunderstand?<br><br>on the other hand, if i just act slutty without telling anyone about it, they will gossip about my sluttiness as if it's the most hideous thing on earth.  come on, so is license to be awful obtained by announcing it?  that easy?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi Matahari,<br><br>i think that when people rally around you when you announce that youÂ’re Â“badÂ”, it may not be done entirely in sincerity. itÂ’s only natural for a friend or even an acquaintance to protest against your own self proclaimed Â“badnessÂ” because itÂ’s the polite thing to do, itÂ’s expected of one. furthermore, rarely does one keep a friend who has the guts to agree with your Â“badnessÂ” each and every time, thus the need to protest against the perceived Â“flawsÂ” of a friend once in a while to retain the friendship/relationship, it takes exceptional self-confidence to accept the criticisms of friends and still seek out their company continually if each and every time you bring up a perceived Â“flawÂ” and they agree wholeheartedly, they may even throw in an extra Â“faultÂ” or two.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>with regards to being slutty and bitchy. how slutty can you get these days? most gals down town are dressed in spaghetti dresses/tees teamed with short, short skirt or jeans, cleavage abound (if theyÂ’ve it, thatÂ’s) and flaunted without shame, if thatÂ’s slutty, then half the population of the gals in town would be sluts, but thatÂ’s not the case, itÂ’s merely the fashion of the moment. or do you mean sluts in the sense that theyÂ’ll sleep with every Tom, Dick or Harry? if theyÂ’re truly indiscriminate in their choice of sex partners, then iÂ’ll say theyÂ’re sluts but still i admire their guts for daring to live that way, to have no inhibitions in having casual sexual relationships and not afraid of letting people know about it even if personally i may not choose this style of life nor encourage it to my friends and love ones.<br><br>as for being bitchy, all of us - males and females - are naturals, itÂ’s a matter of how frank weÂ’re about being one. some will couch their sarcasm behind the veil of politeness, youÂ’ve to read between the lines to get the sting, while others are lazy and canÂ’t be bothered, they slam you with it.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Girls, guys, did you know beforehand that if you proclaim you are bitches and such there will be more supports than condemnation?  To me it seems like cheating (though cheating whom I am not really sure).<br><br>Colette,<br><br>I believe that what you said about support being given for politeness is not always true.  I think when someone says upfront something demeaning (of course it has to be a cool demeaning sort of things, e.g. being bitchy and sluttish, otherwise it has to have a reason: "I am sick of this evil world so I'll be evil, too, buahahahaha") people's initial reaction is "no, you're not like that..." and that sentiment is likely to stick, propelled by the blissful feeling of open-mindedness and understanding.  On the other hand if no announcements were made, people will make their own conclusions that grow and develop when fed by assumptions and half-digested info.<br><br>I read somewhere that this age has become the age of permisiveness.  One can do anything just as long one is ready to acknowledge it.  I mean, look at those serial killers in the states, they have their own cults of gothic looking scraggly femmes!<br><br>------------------<br>There are two kinds of people: those who think that there are two kinds of people and those <span style="font-style: italic;">smart</span> enough to know better</div>
