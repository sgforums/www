            <div class='col-md body'><br>How To Be A Better Couple - 10 steps to enjoying each other better...<br><br>1. Be realistic about each other.<br><br>Don't try to turn your partner into something he or she is not. Let's face it, guys-there's only 1 Pamela Anderson in the world, and even she has had her implants removed! Give our gal a break and understand that her physical appearance is NOT going to change overnight with the help of a few facials or treatments. And ladies, Brad Pitt has already been taken, so youÂ’re gonna have to do with what our guy is like! Chill out, love each other for what u are. There is more to our partner than what meets the eye.<br><br>2. Always talk things out.<br><br>Now guys, I know this is not our favourite pastime or mode of resolving issues, but u know what? This works with the gals. Don't make assumptions about each other's feelings. Learn to express yoruself better so that our partner understands what youÂ’re angry about, or hurt about, or even happy about! When u stop talking to each other from the heart, it's the beginning of the end.<br><br>3. Do stuff together.<br><br>Make an effort to do things together. Do some sports or involve yourselves in some shared activities; something both of u enjoy or are interested in. It could be as simple as watching movies together, or jus strolling hand-in-hand down Orchard Road. Watch soccer with him once in a while though the green patch on TV puts u to sleep in 3 seconds. And guys, do give in if our gal asks for another day at window-shopping, rather than suggest that she goes out with her girlfriends for "that sort of activities" instead. If youÂ’re spending more time with our friends rather than with our partner, it's a warning sign that youÂ’re drifting apart!!!<br><br>4. Meet each other halfway.<br><br>If he agrees to throw out that rotten T-shirt with the "The_Rock" printed, u shouldn't kick up much of a fuss if he asks u to keep our room tidy. There's gotta be a little giving and taking in a relationship, so learn to meet each other halfway.<br><br>5.Show our love<br><br>Buy her flowers or candy or perfume every now and then, even if u have been together for 5years. It's wonderful to continue showing someone that u care for him or her. Cook him a special meal, paint him a Valentine's Day card. Knit him mini-socks he can't wear ( like for decoration purposes =&gt; ), buy him a packet of milk for breakfast, or pack his wardrobe for him...so he knows u can still be romantic and loving despite having been together for quite a while.<br><br>6. Respect each other.<br><br>Stop making jokes about her hair or skin, or whatever it is u love to laugh at. Ask yourself if she thinks if its funny. And if he has an inferiority complex about his height, stop ogling at tall guys and make him feel worse! Love is about respecting each other's feelings and being sensitive to each other at all times.<br><br>7. Bury the past.<br><br>Stop bringing up the past. Gals, don't bring up the happy things about u and our ex to our guy, it would jus make him jealous or unhappy. And guys, don't talk about the happy times that u had with our ex or mention about her in our every other sentence as it would make our gal feel unhappy and she might think that u saying all this because u are gonna get back with our ex or not interested in her anymore.<br><br>8. Sit on our jealousy.<br><br>All of us go through' spells of insecurity at the beginning of the relationship, but don't translate that insecurity into jealousy. If youÂ’re gonna go through our partner's mail and cupboard, and eavesdropping on conversations, u know something is wrong - with u!!! Jealousy is like a poison that slowly spreads through' the relationship before finally killing it. Trust our partner; love has to have trust in it.<br><br>9. Keep our commitments to each other.<br><br>If our partner is standing u up all the time and cancelling dates and breaking promises, u need to talk! If youÂ’re in a relationship, make our partner our priority and don't disappoint them if u can help it. It's really terrible when someone promises to take u to dinner, and then calls to cancel it. Don't make promises u can't keep. If our partner starts to feel that he/she is not important enough to u, u may jus lose him/her.<br><br>10. Be honest.<br><br>Honesty is not scowling at how awful she looks first thing in the morning, or telling him that he has the biceps of a fly! When we say "be honest", we mean expressing our feelings clearly, not being bitingly cruel. When youÂ’re hurt, say so, and when youÂ’re angry, tell him/her, w/o getting hysterical. If u can't be honest with our partner, who can u be honest with? Love is also about honesty, and a relationship where no honesty exists probably isn't worth it!<br><br></div>
