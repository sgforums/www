            <div class='col-md body'><p>So in the context of grave social inequalities between men and women, the Women's Charter was a noble attempt to, in every way possible, to require husbands to treat their wives as equal partners. It was okay during those days to have one-sided obligations; after all, inequality then too was one-sided (okay, maybe 99.999 percent). However, the egalitarian instincts of the Women's Charter has gone awry as socially, the status of women have progressed to a point where some obligations placed on husbands by way of the Woman's Charter in certain factual contexts are un-egalitarian instead. <br><br>The obligation for a man to maintain his wife starts during marriage. <br><br>Section 69(1) provides :<br><strong>"Any married woman whose husband neglects or refuses to provide her reasonable maintenance may apply to a District Court or a Magistrate's Court and that Court may, on due proof thereof, order the husband to pay a monthly allowance or a lump sum for her maintenance."</strong> <br><br>Only in the continuation of total existing social inequalities between men and women may such a one-sided obligation make any sense. Take a very likely scenario: a handicapped (or sick) husband with a wife who earns a sufficient income to provide for his needs. It is ludicrous that in such a case, the wife will not be obliged to provide for the husband. While the intention and spirit of Section 69(1) is commendable, as it requires husbands to take care of their wives when they can afford to and when their wives are dependent on them; it becomes equally callous to then not oblige the wives to do the same in a similar situation. The expression in Section 46(1) is clear - "the husband and the wife shall be mutually bound to co-operate with each other in safeguarding the interests of the union."</p></div>

              <p>The women's charter in Singapore was originally made in the 1960s to raise the status of women in society in general. Now it has remained the same when society itself has changed after the Women's Charter of the 1960s and its provisions. in 1996 , extra provisions have been added  again with a matrimonial asset component  where a woman may set to gain material/monetary possessions from the  breaking of marriage union. It is this clause that is creating problems now.</p>
              <p>Do u seriously think in 1980s, 90s or 2000s, anyone wants to belittle women in career , education and life?</p>
              <p>This woman's charter sh*t at best is a piece of old metal scrap from a bygone era that is still around creating a nuisance </p>

              <p>in china, any woman who wants divorce will have to seek govt assistance if they cannot afford to engage a lawyer. In the govt office, the officials have not much time for you - all they need is for the man and woman to write down all they agree and disagree upon divorce. The judge will just chop and retain a copy and when there are future disputes, that copy will be used as a base to see who has violated the agreement signed. It is so simple and there is nothing anyone can complain so long as both agree to sign on what was mutually agreed or disagreed. </p>
              <p>women charter here is so blessed at men's expense - and greatly biased towards women and against men. even though men disagree, there is nothing we can do. Even if he engage a lawyer, it ought to be the very best and of course expensive to minimize the liability to only a certain extent (due to women charter) but will still have to fork out huge legal costs. </p>
              <p>End of it all, men are bound to be disadvantaged most times - ask any men...most will tell you it ain't worth it to tie the knot ... apart from pay and pay to the govt, men still need to pay and pay even more to women...</p>

              <p>when women plot on exploiting to their advantage, its time to

              There will always be a segment of females who are bent on
              exploiting the Charter for their own selfishness.They demanded full
