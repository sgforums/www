            <div class='col-md body'>yo rainbow princessssssssssss......<br><br>I believe being frank and honest is impt in a relationship....but sometimes too frank might be "dangerous" when your relationship has just begun..<br><br>Glad your relationship has turned out well eventhough you/he knew about each other's past...<br><br>I agreed with you...when my bf told me about his past, i felt "betrayed" and "jealous"...asking myself this question why arent I the one? But come to think of it, everyone has a past and the past might not be what we like.  We dont just like a person for their past...more of their present and future...<br><br>*smilessssssssssssssss*<br><br>Now and then will think of it but will try not to dwell on it too much..I have a past as well but since he didnt judge me for my past who am I to judge him for his past?<br><br>Today, I wish all lovers, couples Happy..Forever...<br><br>I Love you, my dearest...........<br><br>------------------<br>@~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~@<br>It's my life....<br>It's now or never...<br>I ain't gonna live 4ever<br>I just want to live while I'm alive<br>@~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~@</div>
