              <p>@jojo A lot of my friends have gotten caught by NEA before.
              Which makes me think twice of littering everytime. The moment that
              butt dropped into the drain, I was like fuck! I looked around, and
              there was no one in sight AT ALL. The moment I walked into the
              school the NEA officers approached me and assumed I littered
              because there was no rubbish bin in that area. If they caught me
              flicking the butt purposely, of course I wouldn't fight back at all
              because I got caught red handed. But why should I pay the fine when
              I wasn't at fault at all? I mean imagine you were holding your
              tissue when someone knocked into you and the tissue flew into a
              drain, would you feel that it's fair if you got fined for that?</p>
              <p>@maverickz What do you mean report them? I understand that they
              are doing their job but there is no way they could have saw what
              have happened given where they were camping. Could you explain?</p>

              <p>Hey guys.. So I just got fined today for littering of a
              cigerette butt. Now I know most of you might just flame me. But it
              was a clear honest mistake, as there was no rubbish bins nearby, I
              thought of flicking the ash and bringing it into the school to
              dispose of it. But I accidentally flicked the entire butt into the
              drain instead. Just nice 2 nea officers come and fine me, I tried
              explaining but they wouldn't listen. I'm thinkking of heading down
              next week to beg for leniency at the nea building.. Any comments? I
              know smoking is bad and all but that is not the issue now, the
              issue now is that I committed an honest mistake and I got fined for
              nothing.</p>
              <p>Cheers..</p>

              <p>I'm sorry to hear this Louis. In fact I have been warning many people, now must be very careful, when the Govt gives out money, be very very alert. tTheir officers will go on a warpath to recoup some of that.</p>
              <p>It always happens after a payout, heck even i kena once, that time $200 fine.</p>
              <p>Your options are 3 fold:</p>
              <p>a) Appeal in writing or email to NEA. The process will take a month, and almost certainly they will reject. You can then re-appeal or ask for a later payment date, they will of course offer the latter.</p>
              <p>b) Pay the fine and forget about the unpleasant experience</p>
              <p>c) Go to court and plead guilty. Tell the court you only got $200 and ask for installments or just plead guilty but only pay $200. You will be allowed to pay the $200 and they will detain you for the day for the remainding $100 ($100 for a few hours in the lock up).</p>
              <p>My advice is 1 - appeal, why pay so soon, make them work a bit and give their usual bullshit explanations, maybe if you're lucky you might get a warning! Worse case, you pay later, why give back the money so easily?</p>
              <p>In any successful appeal you must be able to pin the blame on someone else, something urgent or really unusual circumstances. So if you go that route, think of a good excuse and give a try.</p>

              <p>You can try but it is difficult. The NEA guys have only one kind
              of job to do and a quota for the day's work, of course they won't
              give you a chance.</p>
              <p>You can go to their HQ and appeal to a different set of
              people.</p>
              <p>Beware that at this early stage, I'm not sure if it's a police
              case or being handled by the NEA. Meaning you might be offered a
              compound fine and if you don't pay, you get a bigger fine. If you
              don't pay that bigger fie, it becomes a jail term.</p>

              <p>Just take my advice and appeal at their HQ. Bring a convincing story. Eg. you're a student, you have a clean record, you don't want to spoil your record, etc. They might let you off, you know.</p>
              <p>Do I think you should take this as a lesson to quit smoking? No reason you can't appeal your fine AND quit.</p>
              <p>Do I think the govt is doing this because they just gave out money? No, they screw you over every day. But you should quit because like 80% of the price of cigarettes is tax.</p>
              <p>Does the govt tax and fine you for your health's sake? Go to MBS and RWS.</p>

              <p>Hmm. I was in a similar situation once. Tried protesting and explaining my case to the NEA officers who 'caught' me but they refused to take in any explanation at all. I reused to hand over my identiication card as I felt it was unfair and they called the police to come over and demanded that I hand it over.</p>
              <p>The policemen gave my details to the NEA officers and that was it. I went home and appealed to NEA and got a letter asking me to plead my case in court. At this point I figured, screw it, I'll just pay the damn fine. </p>

              <p>In all these 'unfair' cases, I find that the complainant at least did something that gave reason to the NEA officers to accost them. They then present their arguements.</p>
              <p>I have not come across any one who says he is just standing there doing nothing and the NEA officers came and book him for littering.</p>
              <p>The time for DO NOT LITTER  education is long over. As can be seen, littering is still a major problem in Singapore. That is because not enough people are caught for littering.</p>
              <p>That is why things like this is happening. Education didn't get through.</p>

              <p>I'm a ex-enforcement officer doing NEA duties but I do not give a shit about quotas and I never did fine anyone. I'm a good guy! But my 'higher-ranked' colleagues are more harsh and if they want to fine anyone, I have to adhere to what they do and assist them. This sucks as I usually feel bad for that guy getting fined!</p>
              <p>Honestly speaking, there is little explanation you can give if they ever see something leaving a person's hands and dropping it on the ground if they insist on issuing a summon.</p>
              <p>If I were in your situation, I would choose to run away instead and hope they could not caught up with me or it may mean spending some time in the nearby NPC. Usually, they will not outrun you as some of them may be carrying stuff and wearing leather shoes unless you fail your IPPT miserably.</p>
              <p>I did ever asked one of those guys working in NEA if they were caught up in that situation and all he replied that he would choose to run away than pay the hefty fine.</p>
              <p>It's all too late now I guess! I really feel for you! $300 is hard to earn! </p>
