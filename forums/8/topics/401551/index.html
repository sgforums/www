              <p>Hi, my friend have problem with a girl. My friend is studying in oversea last year together with that girl. His personality is very quiet, seldom talk and have only two friends and most of the time, he is alone, we can call him a loner. He is not bad in looking as he said that one of his classmate said he is handsome and he is a Chinese guy. He notice a girl sometimes keep looking at him and she is from China. He did not notice her looking at him but only seen her looking at him once. She is the same class as him in a few lessons.<br><br>The first time he noticed her looking at him was when two girls made fun of him, she looked at him. The second time is he saw her looking at him by the computer lab's window mirror when they are having computer lesson. He said that when he look at her, he ignore and do his work, the girl look down and do her work as well. After months, my friend did not notice her that if she looks at him because he did not bother until there is another time, which is in the library, she was looking at him and he look at her and look down, she also look down too. He started to think that he find this girl odd, she keep on looking at him, never smile and just stare at him.<br><br>Later, he sit with his friend, he and his friend were laughing because his friend wrote something funny and they both laugh loud in class. The girl look at him and whisper to her friend something, her friend look and whisper back and they both laugh. My friend started to notice her a lots and he caught her staring at him sometimes when she is alone and in the class sometimes. When she is with her friend, she seldom stare at him, just only once or twice, but when he look at her, her friend look at him and she is like whispering to her friend something and look down while her friend look at him.</p>
              <p>When my friend cross the traffic road to his home, that girl sit at the opposite side of the bus stop and stare at him, most of the time when she is alone. Outside the math and computer class, she sit there alone, waiting for the lecture, my friend walk pass and she stare at him while my friend standing there waiting for the lecture to come. When we walk into the classroom, she use the glass mirror in outside the computer class and look at him. When he look at her in the glass mirror, she quickly look away.</p>
              <p>When he and the girl walk pass outside the classroom such as going to the toilet or along the corridor, she keep looking down, never look at him. She just say hi or smile to the other of his classmate who walk pass her except him and a few people who are not close to her. There was one time, my friend was sitting outside waiting for the International Officer to finish their meeting, he just walk around. Unfortunately, the girl and her friend were sitting there. My friend walk to the office for a while then walk away. The girl said to her friend "I notice this person is always following me." in chinese. My friend heard that she said that to her friend. That girl is over sensitive, my friend is just only going to the office and she said that. She is weird, actually my friend didn't even follow her, just waiting outside the office walking around because of boresome, plus that girl sometimes keep staring at him and he wants to try and find out why.<br><br>During graduation day, when his name is called out to collect his certificate, he walked his way towards the stage and the girl turn behind and look at him. Almost everyone siting around her were looking down except her, she keep on looking at him. After the graduation, the teacher offer foods for them and they had to line up. He walk to line up and the girl also walk to the line up at the same time and she look at him again. My friend thought that he cut her line and he smile and instead putting a gesture to let her line up first, she smile back. Her friend look at him and tell her what's wrong and she said nothing while smiling. After a few days pass which is their exam, she never look at him anymore.<br><br>He told me that one of his friend told him that she got boyfriend already, and also in her facebook, she add almost every classmates except him (my friend) and a handful of students who are not really close to her. His friend told him that in her relationship status, she never put her relationship status. It is quite confusing about her action towards him.<br><br>What I can say is maybe she find him weird, in personality as he is a loner, seldom talk in class or maybe maybe she caught him looking at her but it was her who start looking at him. It is confusing, but since she did not smile at him while starring at him, I can say that maybe she finds him weird in his personality or maybe he is good looking and is interested in him? Not sure, confusing. What would be your thoughts?</p>

              <p><br>You are not attractive that's why no girls approached you. You must have looked like a freak that you were viewed with disdain. Go for a plastic surgery and have a change of face then.</p>
              <p>You and all your anti-whites nonsense. You must have felt inferior deep down for you to harbour a deep hatred for them.</p>
              <p>Go and bleach yourself if you really idolise and are so jealous of them. Freak.</p>

              <p>Dear MissyPixie,</p>
              <p>When I went to UK in 1990, I embraced whites (believe it or not). When I emerged from UK in 1999, I realised what most whites were.</p>
              <p>If you have been thru discriminatiion in a white country, you would not be a sychophantic white-lover (i.e. spg)</p>
