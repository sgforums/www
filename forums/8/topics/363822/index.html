              <p>6 girls trained for 5 years to climb a mountain and they come back to singapore as a hero.</p>
              <p>whats the big deal?</p>
              <p>why don't they spend the 5 years on doing something more meaningful such as helping the poor, doing volunteer work instead?</p>
              <p>or work hard to earn more money so they can give their parents a better life so as to be filial to them. Parents work so hard to feed them and when they grow up already they spend all their time to climb up a mountain instead of taking care of their parents. And the whole country treats them as heros.</p>
              <p>Nowadays kids really don't know how to think. If I am their parents I will be so angry because I have a kid who don't know how to be fifial to me and got no brains</p>

              <p>what are these mountain-climbing girls trying to achieve? that they're the queens of the world? that they're manlier than real men?! that they can do something others can't do?</p>
              <p>pathetic fools. if these folks need to scale the tallest mountain just to affirm their self-worth, i dunno what to say.</p>
              <p>congrats, girls......after these 5 years, there's 6 fewer girls in this world, and 6 more manly men. i'm shocked that your bfs / hubbies are still with you, because by now, compared to you girls, their penises should have shrunk to a point on non-existent, because they would be so feminine compared to you mountain-climbing men with female organs.</p>
              <p>screw you folks, i say......get real.</p>
              <p>if you wanna prove yourself, try other things.</p>
              <p>like getting Kim Jong IL to shut down N-Korea's nuclear plant, or revive the world economy to the state it was in 2001 - 2005. or find a cure for cancer (those researchers are blardy damn fools who waste billions of $$$ and still can't find any cure for cancer / AIDS).</p>
              <p>or better still, revert the environment to what it once was in the early past.</p>
              <p>folks like these 6 men are greatly adored by egoistic folks like our Mr. Lee Kill You, because they bring "fame" to Singapore........first in everything.</p>
              <p>and now look at our effing Changi airport........slipped to 3rd place.......KNN.......what u hell bastards doing??!!! we can no longer boast that Singapore has the no. 1 airport in this farking mad world. KNN.......1st class gahmen rule Singapore rule until like that???!!!!!</p>

              <p>One who has done rock/mountain-climbing and who keeps going back to climb, they themselves also can hardly explain to anyone why they keep going back to climb.
