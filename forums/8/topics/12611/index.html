            <div class='col-md body'>What is about to follow is a TRUE ACCOUNT of what had happened to SOMEONE around me. My ANGER still CANNOT REST every moment that I give it a thought. This is a WARNING of what you should EXPECT to get perhaps in the future to come. Don't be SHOCKED or be in DESPAIR... For I am NOT... Just ANGER and FRUSTRATIONs.....<br><br>EARLY this Nov. 2001. My brother was out alone around the residential district of WEST COAST. He is 23 this year. It was around 3+am in the morning. A MALAY guy hanging around with his gf taunted at him, that guy was with his group of friends. My brother CHOSE to ignore him and just move on. The next moment before he knew it, he was ATTACKED. He was HOSPITALISED and suffered from SEVERE bruises and cuts on his face. His right face and eye have SWOLLEN REAL BAD... I am uncertain of his body damage or injuries. He is still vomitting blood clots nowadays... With bleeding from his ears and nose.... It's MORE than OBVIOUS that he've SUFFERED SERIOUS INTERNAL INJURIES....<br><br>NOW, MY ANGER... The police came to take down his statement and made a police report out of it. (Story telling? OR a NICE REFERENCE should he DIE from this injury... MAYBE just a ROUTINE thing so that they can answer to their BOSS?) My sister called up the Clementi Police Station regarding this matter and asked them how the investigation was going on. The REPLY? NO INVESTIGATION. The BELOW 2 REASONS were given. (1) This is a CIVIL CASE (Sounds all TOO FAMILAR to me..) and the police would not handle such a matter. If we want, we can go SUE the attacker OURSELVES. (2) Even if the police manage to catch the ATTACKERs they would ONLY be given WARNING.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> How nice?<br><br>NOW, I would LIKE to KNOW what is CIVIL CASE? For all I know they've been telling me this is CIVIL CASE, that is CIVIL CASE? CIVIL CASE = Involves citizens? Or does it refer to TROUBLESOME MATTERS...??? Don't they KNOW that it's the RECESSION now? Think we shall be SO RICH and FREE to SUE the people ourselves without them aiding in the INVESTIGATIONs?<br><br>HERE is the EVEN MORE IRONIC part of it... My BROTHER was BEATEN UP near a 7-11 store... 24 HOURS a day... And when he was beaten up there was just a NEIGHBOURHOOD POLICE POST nearby... BUT NO.... It's NOT like your TYPICAL 7-11 STORE... It's NOT 24 hours.... It's those with the 'emergency button' on it just IN CASE you're in trouble... I know we've MADE JOKES out of 'who would be able to go for the BUTTON when a person is being ATTACKED'.... But when you're the one IN TROUBLE, I can BET YOU it ISN'T gonna be FUNNY.... It's ALL TOO OBVIOUS...? Even AN IDIOT can tell that it's a STUPID FLAW.... I SUGGEST they bring a SHIELD down there INSTEAD of a BUTTON? At least something MORE PRACTICAL and USEFUL? What've gone into their minds??? They're SUPPOSE to PROTECT the CITIZENs' lives and UPHOLD LAWs...???<br><br>MAYBE I got it WRONG all this while...? MAYBE their job is NOT to INVESTIGATE into the matter after it had happened.... But just to PREVENT the crimes from HAPPENING... So AFTER it'd happened all they can say is a 'sorry'....? Wait.. No... They DIDN'T even say 'sorry'.... OK... SO that's NOT their job... Then WHAT IS....? AT LEAST BOTHER to PUT ON A BETTER FUCKING SHOW!!! IF they DON'T EVEN BOTHER to INVESTIGATE this matter, for all you know this kinda INCIDENT can HAPPEN OVER and OVER AGAIN...??! &lt;- TALK ABOUT CRIME PREVENTION??!! TOGETHER WE CAN STOP CRIME..??? FUCK YOU!!!! REMEMBER those faces SMILING at you next time round when you're walking around your district ok..??? Your 'FRIENDLY POLICEMAN'.... For you'll never know WHERE they are when you NEED them MOST.....<br><br>HOW do you EXPECT CRIMEs to GO DOWN with such ATTITUDES..??!! And TELL ME, how should we SETTLE THIS...?? ANOTHER VIOLENT OUTBREAK...??? CRIME PREVENTION MY FOOT!!!!<br><br>------------------<br>In LIGHT I shall FEAR NOT. FOR what I AM is CUT so DEEP inside of ME.<br>I LIVE my FLESH and SOUL ONLY to BLEED for the OTHERS.<br>FEAR ME NOT. FOR I AM YOUR 'MASTER'. GIVE YOU STRENGTH. FOR YOU ARE MY 'ENEMY'.<br>DEVIL PHRASE I<br><br>I have no 'friends' nor 'family'.<br>I hold no past and see not future...<br>These are just samples of illusions....<br>I don't exist, but I shall live ETERNITY.....

            <div class='col-md body'>Let me get this correctly.<br><br>This case can be treated as a assault cum battery case. Legal action can be taken with the consideration of rioting. If the NPP or the Police Station aren't doing anything to investigate this scenario, then I would suggest that u bring this case to your MP.<br><br>PS: Sorry to hear of it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess it's really unlucky on your brother's part to encounter such incident.<br><br>And personnally, i observed that the task of policemen are not really citizen oriented. Guess it's still a materialistic world out there, somehow they got to benefit from what ever they are do, e.g fine someone who breaks the law. As long as there is money rolling in, they will be there. Who care about the grief that a normal citizen suffers? They will only rush in when there is a raid on unlawful gambling session or site when they can fine people money. They will show their face and threathen the people during GE2001 in support of the ruling people who ensure their fat rice bowl.<br><br>They will somehow only do their part when serious cases occurred like somebody being murdered that somehow stirred unrest within the district. Small cases like being beaten are all too personal or considered 'civil' for them to handle.<br><br>However, they still serve their purpose to deter crime from happening with their presence and hence still managed the law and order in this small island singapore. At least, no criminal still dare to commit crime in the public's eye like the case in malaysia where school girl can get snatched up by them into their van from the side of a road and gang raped somewhere else.<br><br></div>

Maybe you can ask ur brother to bring down his medical report to the Investigator of the in charge case.<br><br>If the doctor deem fit that your brother sustain grevious injuries, I believe the Police will proceed with the investigation. However, the investigation will be useless if the suspect is not unidentifiable by your brother.<br><br>Maybe you can proceed to any police post to know more about what is CIVIL ACTION. Another option is to go to the subordinate court to lay a magistrate complain. From there, the magistrate will direct the police to invetigate.Free legal advise will be given at there, so poor ppl like u can go and seek advise.<br><br>No point going to the MP as the MP will advise u the same thing.<br><br>I receive letter from the police about they do not compromise about the police presence after the closure of the police post. The officers will be redeploy to do anti-crime duty.<br><br>Sometime we must think, if not for the Police, we will not have a safer home to live in.</div>
