I share your thoughts about rich people too.  Most of them are stingy like hell.  Common people also damn kiasu sometimes, they rush to get into MRT, they dally to go out, they block the stupid escalator, refuse to go to the back of the bus or center of the MRT carriage.<br><br>Then again, not all of Singaporeans are Kiasu.

            <div class='col-md body'>What really is this "kiasu" ? I tend to think of "kiasu" as a good virtue. During my study days, I used to do my homework and revision until mid-night, but my class mates were still having dicussion beyond midnight. Sometime I joined in discussion. Whenever I went to the library, some of them were alredy there with lots of reference books. Our day was not so lucky: no sylabuses, no printed hand-outs only reference books were given. During lectures, we had to take down notes as fast as we could. Singapore is a small country, a little of news like "kitty cats",queueing up for "something" were reported widely.

Someone or something will get side effects.  If all students are kiasu, they will borrow all the reference books and hide them in some secret section of the library.  How about the rest of the students who wants to use the text?  Kiasu at work, if you're afraid of losing at work.  Often people will try different ways to curry flavour the boss, backstab another colleague, etc.<br><br>As for the "Hello Kitty" incident that set back civilisation by at least 10 years.  I think its perculiar to Singaporeans only.  Such is our unhealthy culture here.  Please let me know which other countries are doing this?  Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, Japan?<br><br>What your friends are doing is partly kiasu but its more of a case of being hardworking.  Being dilligent, helping others, being kind are not traits found in kiasuism.  Personally, I think it stinks!  Phoooo~~~</div>
