            <div class='col-md body'>Therez a real terrifying incident I can't get out of my mind. Sure get the spookz whenever I thought abt it!<br><br>All encounters are during my NS dayz. If I am bullshitting... well, may a zillion voltz zap me.<br><br>1st encounter<br>-------------<br>Tat time I was alone in the Guardroom. I was on guard duty (everyday since I am an RP) and the whole unit nobody. My palz have ran outside (not supposed to but...) for makan and some beer. Only the Unit Dog and myself. I was watching Dong You Ji at tat time around 1945 when I heard something outside the gate.<br><br>Frm where I was sitting, I could see the gate clearly. There was nobody, but the dog juz rushed over the gate and barked like siao. I thought if there was any intruderz and took the baseball bat, put on my slipperz and walked over.<br><br>Of course, I couldn't see anyone. And the dog had stopped barking and looked at me wif a strange look. I swore at the dog.<br><br>"Wah lao eh. Fuck u lah! Nobody u bark for wat?"<br><br>RITE AT THAT MOMENT, a gust of chilly wind started BLOWING! DAMN STRONG! THE TREES START SHAKING THEIR LEAVES!!! All my hair stood on the endz.<br><br>I got terrified and started praying. "Pai say lah... Pai say lah... Dui Bu Qi..." and I prayed in all 4 directionz.<br><br>The wind STOPPED IMMEDIATELY!<br><br>Being terrified, I brought the dog into the Guardroom. (which it wasn't supposed to, by right, but I din care. I was terrified) I didn't slept tat night.....<br><br>(TO BE CONTINUED...)</div>

It was around 8+ tat night, so I'd thought I'd call my friend to have a little chat.<br><br>I was talking and talking in the room. Juz den, I heard someone calling me frm outside. I could hear the sound very distinctly. The person was calling my chinese name...<br><br>I thought my Team I/C and my pal has came back liao. So I told my friend to hang on and I walked out of the room and saw...<br><br>NO ONE AT THE GATE!<br><br>I thought it was my imagination and went back yakking, but the 2nd time I am sure I heard it right. SOMEONE WAS CALLING MY CHINESE NAME!!!!<br><br>I rushed out and SAW NO ONE AT THE GATE!<br><br>Wah liew.... I was so damn frightened. Cos my Team I/C and my pal went out for makan and they took the MOTORCYCLE out! It was an Aprilla model and made a sound tat could be heard few hundred metres away. BUT THERE WAS NO SOUND OF A MOTORCYCLE! AND MY TEAM I/C ONLY CALLS ME BY MY ENGLISH NAME!!!!!<br><br>Wah piang eh... so farking scared tat I stayed in the room till I heard the familiar sound of motorbike, the opening of the gate and the VRROOMMM sound of the bike, going past the Guardroom.<br><br>Never told anyone, never got to sleep.

I was on duty again and was sleeping in the aircon room (together wif all the other fellaz. Nobody cared a damn, all went to sleep). I was a pretty light sleeper and could get much sleep. Then I heard it...<br><br>There'z a radio in the opposite room and I am pretty sure that I switched it off before I slept. I heard the radio turn itself ON and was playing some Hokkien and English songz!! I thought I heard wrongly and went up to check it. There was nobody out there and the radio was switched off. I shrugged it off and went back to the room. I heard it again... This time even more terrifying....<br><br>There were FOOTSTEPZ SHUFFLING OUTSIDE THE GUARDROOM!!! AND I COULD HEAR WHISPERINGS!! I rushed out immediately and saw NOTHING!!!<br><br>I closed the door and barely walked a few stepz to my bed when I heard it again. This time the footstepz of SEVERAL PEOPLE AND EVEN MORE WHISPERINGS. I tried to quieten my mind and tried to hear what are the whisperings, but I couldn't make what they said. Soundz like Hokkien, English, Chinese and all a mixture (My mum told me it was 'spirit language' later). I rushed out again and saw NO ONE!!!<br><br>This time, all my rushings woke one of my palz up and he told me to get back to sleep. Brr.... how am I supposed to get any sleep wif all those 'things' outside?!?!<br><br>Didn't sleep tat night though and nearly got killed by my team matez for disturbing them wif my opening and closing of doorz the night b4...<br><br>(TO BE CONTINUED...)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This isn't wat I call a spooky one. But wat I've related are among the 4 most spookiest encounterz in my camp. This is the final one and the very last I've encountered.<br><br>FINAL ENCOUNTER<br>---------------<br><br>It was a sad day. The security officer from another unit came down and was ordered to send our unit dog (which had served us so many yearz) away to Sembawang Beach. Apparently, my boss didn't like him and accused our dog of car scratching. Everyone was quite sad and the dog didn't know it. I volunteered to accompany the Security Officer down to Sembawang Park to release the dog.<br><br>The dog didn't know it. But tried to jump off the van as we had to force it up. Fuck our boss, NBCB to him. But orders are orders. As we shut the door, we could see tears in the dog's eyes...<br><br>We reached Sembawang Park and released the dog in an ulu-ulu place to make sure he can't find his way back.<br><br>I wasn't on duty tat night but stayed back anyway, to accompany my palz and to play Chor Dai Di wif em. Later I went to sleep and had this very strange dream...<br><br>I was still quite upset abt the dog being sent away, but I saw our dog wagging itz tail and running and jumping towards me as it always did. Licking my handz, yipping happily away, I cried and hugged it. The familiar smell....<br><br>Juz den, (I am a light sleeper) I had this strange presence of the dog being in our room and is BESIDE ME! I could really smell it and felt something wet on my hand! (And BTW, I dun masturbate in camp!) Like the dog was licking my hand earlier in the morning when I sent it off!!!!<br><br>I woke up and it was morning already. Then I realised my pillow was wet and I had been crying the night before (I din realise it myself, cos I didn't really wake up). After the takeover team arrived, I told them about what happened to our dear dog plus this.<br><br>"Kopi die liao. He'll never come back."<br>(and BTW, Kopi is the name of our dog. NOT Kopi-O or Teh-susu!)<br><br>*sob-sob*  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>(THE END)<br>THE ABOVEMENTIONED STORIES ARE TRUE ACCOUNTZ. MAY A ZILLION VOLTZ ZAP ME IF I AM EVER BULLSHITTING OR DUA KANGING.<br><br>------------------------------<br>Kopi our dearest dog, I'll miss u forever...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Itz juz a feeling tat the dog died liao... Juz like yur loved one departed u and u weren't at the scene. Somehow u'll juz get the feeling... Even though I wasn't in my unit for long (1yrz 8mthz to be exact), the dog was like my pet and I treated him as humanly as possible. Not treating him like a dog and even chit-chatting to him (when my palz are not around, of course). I do beat and scold him sometimez, but tatz for a reason, not suka-suka like wat some of my team matez does.<br><br>Anyway for yur info, 7pm I juz step out of my office. I reach Funan abt 7+ - 8pm liao. U want me to make a futile trip izzit???</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wah..this Jeff real suay siak~. I had an encounter last year too.<br><br>I remember I was visiting my grandfather who was hospitalised in Mount Alvernia. I went to the dispensing machine and got myself a drink. Juz behind the machine there's a damn old dipilated toilet at the corner. (All the toilets I've seen there are clean and new except dat one)<br><br>But still I went in the toilet(too lazy to find another one..haha) The moment I pushed the door open, it seems like inside it is abnormally quiet.. I suppose the toilet is not well maintained by the cleaners.<br><br>The eerie part goes like this.. There's only one large cubicle inside the toilet. The one and only one.(like those in the hotel rooms)<br><br>It was closed.<br><br>I sibei gei kiang.I go and open it. Like in the movies, the door creaked and the cubicle is damn fucking eerie.. Immediately!! I sensed something is in front of me!! I know some may find it ridiculous but its true!<br><br>I felt a bit gia gia by then. So I go out of the cubicle. SUDDENLY.. The damn door CLOSED!!! All I heard is BOMP!!! Mind you, the door has no spring or wad and the hospital is air-conditoned!!! I ran out of the toilet like mad!! Haha..</div>
