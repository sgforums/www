            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://filmuniversum.de/personen/pic/Williams_John.jpg"><br><strong>John Williams</strong><span style="font-style: italic;"> ( America)</span><br>One of the most popular and successful American orchestral composers of the modern age, John Williams is the winner of five Academy Awards, 17 Grammys, three Golden Globes, two Emmys and five BAFTA Awards from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. Best known for his film scores and ceremonial music, Williams is also a noted composer of concert works and a renowned conductor.Williams has composed the music and served as music director for many well known films including Saving Private Ryan,  The Lost World, Schindler's List, Jurassic Park, Home Alone,  the Indiana Jones trilogy,  the Star Wars trilogy, E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial,   Superman, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Jaws<br><br><img src="http://img88.imageshack.us/img88/6967/midi4hy.jpg"><br><strong>A.R. Rahman</strong> <span style="font-style: italic;">( India )</span><br>A  modern day Electro-accoustic composer from India well known for his extreme versality in sound engineering and technology keeping the listener in awe. He was accredit for bringing a new concept to music in India and perhaps worldwide with those of electronic or industrialised computerised sounds.<br>First introduced as a 22 year old in 1992, Rahman was primarily a private ad jingles composer for cable TV and was discovered by chance when a top director was looking for a last minute replacement for his film. But his first film score, Roja, fetched him the National Film Award in 1992 , and thrust him into the limelight. In the 13 years since Roja, he has created music for numerous blockbuster Indian films.His 1995 soundtrack for Bombay crossed 5 million units and Rahman had arrived as the "King of Indian Pop" with sales of more than 40 million albums over a period of 3 years and has worked with famous worldwide artistes like Andrew Loyd Webber , Michael Jackson and Vanessa Mae .He established a state of the art sound and recording studio in the early '90s and began experimenting in sound engineering, design and production. He also began a collection of sound samples, creating one of the most comprehensive sonic libraries in Asia.<br><br><img src="http://www.wabe.org/tv/images/1204/yanni.jpg"><br><strong>Yanni</strong> <span style="font-style: italic;">( Greece )</span><br>Born in Kalamata, Greece, Yanni arrived in the U.S. after high school and obtained a degree in psychology from the University of Minnesota before diving headfirst into music. It didn't take long for the self-taught keyboardist and composer to establish himself as a studio musician, jingles composer, and producer. After gaining an impressive cult following for his first independently released album, Yanni was picked up by Private Music and has become one of the label's best-selling artists.<br><br>One of the most visible artists in the contemporary instrumental realm, Yanni's rise to fame was expedited in the early '90s by his romantic relationship with actress Linda Evans, which gained him coverage on mainstream programs like Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous as well as appearances on the daytime talk-show circuit. ~ Linda Kohanov, All Music Guide<br><br>Yanni's grandiose keyboard style is both accessible and exciting, two elements that have led to his success in the realm of adult alternative radio. His explosive, pop-influenced instrumentals and romantic pianistic ballads have also made him a popular touring and recording artist for the Private Music label. In addition to his original television, commercial, and film scores, Yanni's music has been used extensively on programs like Wide World of Sports and coverage of the Olympic games. This aspect of his career seems especially appropriate when you consider that he achieved early success not as a musician, but as a member of the Greek national swimming team. (He broke the national freestyle record at age 14.)<br><br><img src="http://byubroadcasting.org/programaz/images/andreslloydwebber.jpg"><br><strong>Andrew Lloyd Webber</strong> <span style="font-style: italic;">( Europe )</span><br>Baron Lloyd-Webber (born March 22, 194<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> is a highly successful British composer of musical theatre. He has arguably been the most popular theatre composer of the late 20th century, with multiple musicals which have run for more than a decade both on Broadway and in the West End. Throughout his career he has produced 15 musicals, 2 film scores, and a Latin requiem mass. He has also accumulated a number of honors, including seven Tony Awards, three Grammy Awards, an Oscar, an International Emmy, six Olivier Awards, and a Golden Globe Award. Several of his songs, notably "I Don't Know How to Love Him" from Jesus Christ Superstar, "Don't Cry For Me, Argentina" from Evita, "Memory" from Cats and "The Music of the Night" from The Phantom of the Opera have been widely recorded and were hits outside of their parent musicals.<br><br></div>
