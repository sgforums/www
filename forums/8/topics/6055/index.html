            <div class='col-md body'>HK: Sorry abt the 'Chio' comment..for fun only ok?<br>But I feel that this dichotomy in behaviour infront of and away from their parents is disturbing. Young Parents dote on their children and substitute material things for their absence from the home due to the individual biographies that are dictated by the 'Market economy freedom'. The company dictates your life and you have to work to keep food on the table.<br><br>These young children are being brought up by their Filipino Maids and they (the children) emulate their parent's treatment of the maid. Suppose the parents treat the maid as some sub-species of a third world country, this perpetuates the lack of respect for adults which they associate with authority figures.<br><br>The audacity of young children today is extreme. There was once this kid ran around my house screaming and climbing on the window grills and the parents just sat there and smiled at the hyperactivity of their offspring!<br><br>That was 5 years ago. They are the lower sec, lower primary children today whose behaviour worm was disgusted abt. There is a direct link.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, the worst thing that could happen if these "unruly" behaviours are brought to other countries.<br><br>Like what Hello Kitty said behaving like angels when parents are around.<br><br>My fren drove properly and carefully when his parents visit him. THe moment parents leave, he would be the king of the road.<br>Sigh, it is a sad thing when parents trust their 17-18 yr olds to be overseas when they are not mature enuff to govern their own.<br><br>What's worst, he never learnt his lessons. He have been a victim of road rage because he cut into ppl's lane and that person pursued him and warned him with a club.<br><br>Then he have been fined for about $300 altogether now for speeding, illegal parking and undue noises (burn tire).<br><br>Hope someday, he will learn his lessons AND still live.</div>
