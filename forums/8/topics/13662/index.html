            <div class='col-md body'>No, guys! what he hed said is true.There is only ONE GOD! if u are not a Christian,then,ur life must be a total waste worshipping other gods! they dont exist at all.Our God and Jesus Christ have blessed me and touched me!We cannot see them,but we can feel their presence!i used to be a lecherous person! but God had touched me thet ONCE and i just turned over a new leaf!I cried for the whole day!he had entered my heart and touched me!He did and does exist!The BIBLE is a true and factual object,may GOD BLESS U!AMEN<br>[This message has been edited by Roy, God's son (edited 10 February 2002).]<br><br>I really hate your sentence by saying if u are not a Christian u be total waste of time believing other gods...I know god have touch u but that doesn't means u can critise other reglious... u are born or only view in Christian, try to see and learn more teaching in other reglious and u will have your doubts about Christian...<br><br>God is really only one but that does not mean he only sent one Jesus to earth... there is also other....<br><br>Words being say here is totally from a confuse yet blindly cover by evil man; read all before u try to reply. Else jus ignore from the first paragraph and say your shit by pressing (POST REPLY)<br><br>Sometime when we think about it.... yes I agree there is really one god.... but god have sent many so call &lt;people&gt; down to earth like Jesus, Buddha, Muhammad and many other which then have each of their reglious, no matter is Christian, Muslim, Buddhism, Hindus and many more.... in the end all are lead to god which are then the so call WAYÂ�@to god... now Jesus to me is what sin u have done in the end u believe him u will go heaven as he have help u repay for your sin and forgive u, correct me if wrong, Buddhism is a long way, what u do u will repay in the next life till u do not own what u have own other &lt;object&gt; and as for the rest u go check about it, now if they or so call god translator come down to spread their way to the only god... then y are there so many different way of achieve way to god, is it possible that any one of them have been changed this few hundred or thousand years? One of my friend told me that god in Christ say u can eat what u wan in earth but no killing of human or sin blah blah, then y mulism can't eat pork, Chinese can't eat cow? Buddhism can't eat meat? Is there a change over the years? Bible or what book u all read yes there are mostly correct but what makes u think its right as over the years it may have been change...jus a little or more I dun no.<br><br>In Buddhism, I believe that what u done to other u have to repay... in this life u kill a man, the next life or soon u have to return him... same goes to chicken or pork, that is y those who believe Buddhism eat veg, due to this there is so call afterlife, now in Jesus, u can eat meat but dun u have to repay them? As those who believe in Jesus will go to heaven or should I ask those who believe in Jesus that in heaven u will also have to repay them? If not what happen to those who have done all the crime and believe god in the end? You can say that Jesus have repay them by been hang on the cross but is that enough? Or is it because that god knows man are hopeless that all translator of god have make man so lazy to follow that he sent Jesus down to die for human so as to not repay what these human have done? If yes y not all religions all believe in Jesus alone can liao, remember god is fair...<br><br>I not saying that Jesus is wrong, what Jesus have told u in your heart is very true as he have already give his life to us, I believe him too but dun u think a history can be change not by going back but a change in the regliou's book?<br><br>Christian means ??? believe in Jesus if so y are there believe in god only, Mary only?  Is there a relationship between them?<br><br>Remember if man can kill Jesus, y can't they change Jesus way...<br><br>Magician can cast magic because they make the viewer think in their mind that what they see hear smell or touch is true...but actually its all trick... because this viewer can't see what behind the magician is doing. Same goes to those what the so call history changer has done....<br><br>You say donÂ�ft know what dead sea got what book which is the same as the bible, dun u think its another &lt;magician&gt; trick?<br><br>If there is good there is also bad, now if u are the bad what will u do if u wan to destroy the &lt; good way thinking &gt;if u are a follower of the bad....<br><br>Jus imagine over the years if in the bible that there is something call have sex with may people is also a way, will u still go for it? Remember because its what the book says<br><br>Another thing jus by changing a little such as eating meat is fine because &lt;god has created this for u to eat&gt; this sentence, to u, u may think it fine but is it also one of a sin, which whom have overwritten?<br><br>I was confuse, all of the reglion is almost the same yet a few of them is like being change over the years.<br><br>A tree is called a tree because many people or book says itÂ�fs a tree thatÂ�fs y u follow.<br>Now if in a village 99 people rape their sister except u, and they say its wrong will u still do it? Jus because other people say so or do so will u follow them?<br><br>No matter which reglious is fine with me as long as u have set your heart in it and not jus because itÂ�fs easy to follow which reglious so as to have the way to god thus u follow it<br><br>To me follow your heart and your reglious is the best, u can believe what regliou u wan but think about it, go ask your believer friend some question sometime they may not be able to answer because they follow books or what their &lt;master&gt; say so.... they can give u crap because books have all the religious book have most answer to all question but not all if u really think about it<br><br>If u dun believe what I say or itÂ�fs a load rubbish... fine go think of this relationship...<br>U were driving a car, u saw a rabbit cross your first reaction is to brake because u know u will kill it which is a bad thing or sin, but at home your mum bought a chicken or even few crabs, will u kill it for chicken curry or chill crabs to eat? If u think its fine, then y not u ran over the rabbit and bring it home for supper too since the past two thousand years bible have say Jesus will repay the sin and forgive u? These entire three item we talking here are animals... think about it.<br><br>Second, y is there people out there saying stop killing the animals? Is it because they fear the animals will extinct or is it a sin which make them feel they should not kill animals anymore.... yet they still continue eating chicken and pork as these animal will not extinct so fast?<br><br>Y do god sent so many so-call translators to earth? Is it because each translator for each different language people or is it because human have made many mistake that god have to repeatly sent so many different translator to correct the human way?<br><br>In the bible, it only talks about birth and 30 years later of him, but in the middle of these years where did Jesus go? Have he ever travel to India or china before? DonÂ�ft give me crap about its far between country else are u trying to say da mo travel from India to china is fake?<br><br>Mulism and Christian is so closely related which I have heard the story from my 30+ friend<br>That it is only by one line that separate them, y is this so? What about osama's holy war? To me its a total crap as this is jus to create war... if so then y does those people who fight with him agree? Is it because they also knew its crap or they truly believe there is a holy war in their bible? If so y does u still believe in jus a bible as it may also have some wrong things in it that cause u to follow it and thus have lead to the wrong way...?<br><br>I not trying to say u should not believe in bible or anything but I trying to say always follow your heart...follow your heart no matter what because that is where most evil have tried to attack.... yet not success as god is always with u and your heart... but if u dun believe in god.... evil will take over your heart one day.<br><br>All the words say here are all what I have thought these past years... and I will not answer to anyone of u as I still finding what the true way is.... I am like anyone of u... still lost and confuse.... dun think u know it unless u have read through all different reglious books no matter is Christ, Buddhism, Muslim or Hindu...until now no matter from age 18 to 81 still can't answer my question including u....<br><br>------------------<br>.......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by benjamin82:</div><div class="quote_body">I really hate your sentence by saying if u are not a Christian u be total waste of time believing other gods...I know god have touch u but that doesn't means u can critise other reglious... u are born or only view in Christian, try to see and learn more teaching in other reglious and u will have your doubts about Christian...<br></div></blockquote>if you really bothered to read about Christianity, to read good theological books, read the Bible, go to church and open your eyes to the Christian perspective, then you'd have  unlimited doubts about NOT being a Christian.<br><br><blockquote> <strong><br>God is really only one but that does not mean he only sent one Jesus to earth... there is also other....<br></strong></blockquote>Oh and I forgot, you speak to God. You don't even know which one to speak to. There is only one God but you choose to speak to everything else except God.<br><br><blockquote> <strong><br><br>Sometime when we think about it.... yes I agree there is really one god.... but god have sent many so call &lt;people&gt; down to earth like Jesus, Buddha, Muhammad and many other which then have each of their reglious, no matter is Christian, Muslim, Buddhism, Hindus and many more.... in the end all are lead to god which are then the so call WAYÂ�@to god...<br></strong></blockquote>Everyone else you mentioned claims to be from God. But only one is from God, Jesus the Son of God.<br>Only He came back to life from the dead, all the rest died and remained dead.<br><br><blockquote> <strong><br>now Jesus to me is what sin u have done in the end u believe him u will go heaven as he have help u repay for your sin and forgive u, correct me if wrong, Buddhism is a long way, what u do u will repay in the next life till u do not own what u have own other &lt;object&gt; and as for the rest u go check about it, now if they or so call god translator come down to spread their way to the only god... then y are there so many different way of achieve way to god, is it possible that any one of them have been changed this few hundred or thousand years?<br></strong></blockquote>they aren't the same.<br>there are only two types of religion in this world, one that believes only God can save you, and another that believes by your works, you can earn God's salvation. Only one falls into the first category. That is Christianity. We cannot save ourselves, if we could, there'd be no need for God.<br>And finally, Buddhism has no god. Its a philosophy. Not a faith, not a religion. Go study it carefully. I have as I have all the others. Have you? Have you even studied Christianity carefully before talking so much?<br><br><blockquote> <strong><br>One of my friend told me that god in Christ say u can eat what u wan in earth but no killing of human or sin blah blah, then y mulism can't eat pork, Chinese can't eat cow? Buddhism can't eat meat? Is there a change over the years?<br></strong></blockquote>it's simple, they aren't the same religion in the first place. and furthermore, who ever said they were? u urself, and only u. not me.<br>besides, only Christianity is right.<br><br><blockquote> <strong><br>Bible or what book u all read yes there are mostly correct but what makes u think its right as over the years it may have been change...jus a little or more I dun no.<br></strong></blockquote>the Bible is based on manuscripts dating to 30 A.D. or so, so its quite original.<br><br><blockquote> <strong><br>As those who believe in Jesus will go to heaven or should I ask those who believe in Jesus that in heaven u will also have to repay them? If not what happen to those who have done all the crime and believe god in the end? You can say that Jesus have repay them by been hang on the cross but is that enough? Or is it because that god knows man are hopeless that all translator of god have make man so lazy to follow that he sent Jesus down to die for human so as to not repay what these human have done? If yes y not all religions all believe in Jesus alone can liao, remember god is fair...<br></strong></blockquote>its absolutely because all the good that mankind can every do, is never as good as Jesus has done. no man's life can ever match that of Jesus' life. when we compare and try to boast of our works compared to his, we lose. so we can use all our good works and try to use them as a reason to tell God that we shouldn't have to go to hell when we die, but when measured against Jesus, we are nothing, and can only deserve eternal death.<br>Yet Jesus's death paid for all our misdoings, there is no more punishment for those who accept that. But it doesnt mean that we should go on sinning, for a genuinely grateful heart will not do things to frustrate Jesus' goodwill and grace. We will sin, because we are imperfect, but we should do our best not to, if we really love Him. Still it is not our work, but His grace and death on the cross that saves us.<br>WE CANNOT PAY FOR OUR SINS, EVEN IF WE DIE. BECAUSE OUR LIVES ARENT GOOD ENOUGH. ONLY JESUS WHO IS GOD, AND WHOSE LIFE IS GOOD ENOUGH, WAS WORTHY ENOUGH TO MAKE THE PAYMENT FOR OUR SINS.<br><br><blockquote> <strong><br><br>Christian means ??? believe in Jesus if so y are there believe in god only, Mary only?  Is there a relationship between them?<br></strong></blockquote>Mary was a virgin when she gave birth to Jesus, Mary is in no way God's wife if that is what you mean. There was no sexual relationship whatsoever.<br>But a miracle that out of nothing, a child was conceptualised in her womb. That is the miracle of Jesus' birth, to show that he was not born of a sexual relationship but of a miraculous work of God.<br><br><blockquote> <strong><br>Remember if man can kill Jesus, y can't they change Jesus way...<br></strong></blockquote>the men managed to crucify Jesus because He wanted them to, so that His death could erase our sins. and by the way, mankind didnt win, Jesus came back to life. He didnt stay dead like the rest.<br><br><blockquote> <strong><br>Magician can cast magic because they make the viewer think in their mind that what they see hear smell or touch is true...but actually its all trick... because this viewer can't see what behind the magician is doing. Same goes to those what the so call history changer has done....<br></strong></blockquote>well, the Bible is not like any history book, whilst it carries facts, it is also the Word of God. read it one time, cover to cover, i dare you. i have read the shintoist sutras before and the english quran. so i dare you to read it one time, and then think for yourself if it is true. because lies can be fictionalised but truth will definitely speak to you. dont understand what i mean? read it and find out what truth is.<br><br><blockquote> <strong><br><br>You say donÂ�ft know what dead sea got what book which is the same as the bible, dun u think its another &lt;magician&gt; trick?<br></strong></blockquote>no trick. the dead sea scrolls lie in the museums for your inspection.<br><br><blockquote> <strong><br>If there is good there is also bad, now if u are the bad what will u do if u wan to destroy the &lt; good way thinking &gt;if u are a follower of the bad....<br><br>Jus imagine over the years if in the bible that there is something call have sex with may people is also a way, will u still go for it? Remember because its what the book says<br></strong></blockquote>the Bible never promoted promiscuity. read it.<br>see for urself.<br><br><blockquote> <strong><br>Another thing jus by changing a little such as eating meat is fine because &lt;god has created this for u to eat&gt; this sentence, to u, u may think it fine but is it also one of a sin, which whom have overwritten?<br></strong></blockquote>eating of meat was never a sin. God gave all the green plants for food in the beginning to Adam and Eve. But in Noah's case, He told him that all meat was now for him to consume as well. It was never a sin. It was just never a desire to eat meat in the beginning at all. NOTE: never was it stated as a sin or even forbidden. it was just written that God offered all the green plants for Adam and Eve to choose as food.<br>read it.<br><br><blockquote> <strong><br>I was confuse, all of the reglion is almost the same yet a few of them is like being change over the years.<br><br>A tree is called a tree because many people or book says itÂ�fs a tree thatÂ�fs y u follow.<br>Now if in a village 99 people rape their sister except u, and they say its wrong will u still do it? Jus because other people say so or do so will u follow them?<br></strong></blockquote>of course the majority is not always right. i hope u rnt that silly too. by the way, i told u before only two types of religion in this world. read my above comments.<br><br><blockquote> <strong><br>No matter which reglious is fine with me as long as u have set your heart in it and not jus because itÂ�fs easy to follow which reglious so as to have the way to god thus u follow it<br></strong></blockquote>that is very sad and ridiculous that man should choose what God is like to him and follow that which suits his preference. then man makes God. not God makes man. utter rubbish.<br><br><blockquote> <strong><br>U were driving a car, u saw a rabbit cross your first reaction is to brake because u know u will kill it which is a bad thing or sin, but at home your mum bought a chicken or even few crabs, will u kill it for chicken curry or chill crabs to eat? If u think its fine, then y not u ran over the rabbit and bring it home for supper too since the past two thousand years bible have say Jesus will repay the sin and forgive u? These entire three item we talking here are animals... think about it.<br></strong></blockquote>yeah i try to avoid the animal because i dont wanna splatter it all over the road. just because Jesus forgives u doesnt mean that u shud go and kill anything and any1 u want. think abt it. if ur mother forgives u for stealing, does it mean u go and steal everyday from her?<br><br><blockquote> <strong><br>Second, y is there people out there saying stop killing the animals? Is it because they fear the animals will extinct or is it a sin which make them feel they should not kill animals anymore.... yet they still continue eating chicken and pork as these animal will not extinct so fast?<br></strong></blockquote>this is a question for the animal conservationists. not really related to Christianity. but perhaps they fear extinction of the animal. and as to why they eat meat, it is not my business.<br><br><blockquote> <strong><br><br>Y do god sent so many so-call translators to earth? Is it because each translator for each different language people or is it because human have made many mistake that god have to repeatly sent so many different translator to correct the human way?<br></strong></blockquote>God only sent one Son, Jesus. The religious people of the other religions don't come from God, according to God. There are liars everywhere. These are called anti-Christs and false prophets. The prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah and others described in the Bible however, are as you say, God's repeated warnings to His rebellious people.<br><br><blockquote> <strong><br>In the bible, it only talks about birth and 30 years later of him, but in the middle of these years where did Jesus go? Have he ever travel to India or china before? DonÂ�ft give me crap about its far between country else are u trying to say da mo travel from India to china is fake?<br></strong></blockquote>no. it isnt necessary to describe every second of Jesus' life. so the Bible concentrates on His ministry, when He was 30 years onwards. He didnt go to China. He went to Egypt with His family as a boy though, because Herod the King was trying to kill the Savior. Question: why do you think the Bible doesnt teach you how to shave your moustache or wash your backside? Answer: Not important.<br><br><blockquote> <strong><br>Mulism and Christian is so closely related which I have heard the story from my 30+ friend<br>That it is only by one line that separate them,<br></strong></blockquote>i wasnt there when this conversation with ur friend took place. u'll hv to clarify with him what he means.<br><br><blockquote> <strong><br>y is this so? What about osama's holy war? To me its a total crap as this is jus to create war... if so then y does those people who fight with him agree? Is it because they also knew its crap or they truly believe there is a holy war in their bible?<br></strong></blockquote>no, if u read the quran, it says they can go into holy war only if they are the minority in the situation. so osama is doing the wrong thing according to their book.<br><br><blockquote> <strong><br>If so y does u still believe in jus a bible as it may also have some wrong things in it that cause u to follow it and thus have lead to the wrong way...?<br></strong></blockquote>i believe in the Bible, i read it cover to cover. all of it. and it is true. read it and u will know what i mean. also i have seen God working in my life and in others' lives. it is not just a book and not just words. But God's Words. why? read it and u can tell. really! read it from beginning to end, it is one long story but worth reading! because it is God's love story for you.<br>and the Bible doesnt ever teach us to go into holy war, so dont worry. it is written in Revelation, that God Himself will wage the final war. Not mankind on his behalf.<br><br><blockquote> <strong><br>I not trying to say u should not believe in bible or anything but I trying to say always follow your heart...follow your heart no matter what because that is where most evil have tried to attack.... yet not success as god is always with u and your heart... but if u dun believe in god.... evil will take over your heart one day.<br><br>All the words say here are all what I have thought these past years... and I will not answer to anyone of u as I still finding what the true way is.... I am like anyone of u... still lost and confuse.... dun think u know it unless u have read through all different reglious books no matter is Christ, Buddhism, Muslim or Hindu...until now no matter from age 18 to 81 still can't answer my question including u....<br><br></strong></blockquote>well, i have. period.</div>
