Their first interaction with outsiders were from the Persia area. Because their skin has been somewhat "sunburnt", hence these "barbarians" are referred to as "Hong Mao" (Red skin).<br><br>As time evolved, the word "Hong Mao", literally translated into Hokkien is "ang" (Red) and "mo" (Skin/Hair) and hence "angmo". "angmo" itself is not a Hokkien word. Please do not have this misunderstanding.<br><br>I think the only Hokkien words you know are "KNNBCCB" and "NLB".....hence I cannot fault your misconception of Hokkien though it's clear you do not have any wish to further your understanding of the language and clear your misconception. For that, you've failed in life. Go and die now. Thank you very much!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
