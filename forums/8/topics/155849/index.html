            <div class='col-md body'>I refer to Khushwant Singh's article,"China bride deserts man after 3 months"(The Straits Times, 17-Sep-05). This latest article should serve as yet another warning for Singaporean men to exercise diligent care and caution  before marrying prospective foreign marriage partners.<br><br>The article hightlighted the plight of  a Singapore man, aged 42, who married a young Chinese lady, aged 21 from Hainan, China. The man had high hopes of starting a family with his young China bride, but she was reluctant to be intimate with him. Finally, he appealed to the High Court successfully for permission to start divorce proceedings even though the couple's marriage was less than the minimum three years period.<br><br>I understand that some Singaporean men, who are eager to start a family soon, prefer to marry young ladies age 18-22,  citing child bearing as their first priority. However, other than the age factor, it is equally important that before marriage, both parties must share the same family value - that is both parties must have the desire of wanting to start a family as soon as possible after marriage. It was obvious in the case of the 42 years old Singaporean man  that his former wife did not share his family value. He had probably  hoped and thought that his former wife would go along with his plan after marriage. Thus, it is safe to conclude that the marriage broke up three months later when both parties had incompatible life goals and family values.<br><br>For Singapore men who are sincere and seriously considering Chinese ladies from foreign countries as life marriage partners, but have neither the time, knowledge and expertise on how to go about in finding compatible, life marriage partners, they should seriously consider partnering with professional matchmaking and marriage agencies which provide personalised matchmaking and marriage service.<br><br>The benefits of personalised matchmaking and marriage service are as follows:<br><br>Before marriage, both you and your potential marriage partner, have the advantage of knowing and understanding in advance ( without any guesswork) :<br><br>* The personal background information of each other such as Family, Education, Work, Interests, Lifestyle, Finance,etc.  Unlike in dating, bride tour, cash and carry bride where two partners usually try to hide certain important facts from each other only to realise later after marriage that they are really not compatible as life partners.<br><br>* Both of you share similar life goals and family values. These are the two important qualities for a successful and  blissful marriage.<br><br>* Both of you have the desired character traits, commitment and responsibilities to make your marriage a success.<br><br>* The comfort of knowing that you have found a marriage partner who accept you for who you are and not what you have,  who has the desired spiritual qualities, who has the willingness and humility to serve you and your family members,  able to live with you in thick and thin, able to communicate and live with you  for the next 30 - 40 years of marriage life.<br><br>* There will not be any unpleasant surprises after marriage as both of you are psychologically prepared and being fully aware about the personality of each other.<br><br>* Both of you can concentrate and focus on building your relationship with each other after marriage.<br><br>* You can concentrate and focus on meeting the right marriage partner who share with you similar life goals, family values and has desirable character traits. Therefore, you will not be wasting your time in meeting ladies who are nice looking and charming,  but are not suitable to be your life marriage partner.<br><br>I would like to stress that marriage is not something that Singaporean men should take lightly especially if you are planning to marry a lady from overseas irregardless of whether they are from Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia or Hainan. Partner only with professional matchmaking and marriage agencies who place clients' interest and personal happiness first. It is important to note that if you marry someone from overseas without any planning, you are actually planning to have an unhappy and failed marriage.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I know of one ang moh guy.  Met his ex wife (a chinese national), who was then still his wife.  She was quite a fine lady, very educated, though she was too young for him.  She's not bad looking.  Look a bit like Chow Yun Fatt's wife that kind of features (eyes big big one).  But I reckoned that she really liked him from the way she took care of him.  One year later, I heard that the ang moh guy cheated on this wife for another china girl.  The wife found mushy sms on the ang moh guy's handphone after he came back from his regular business trip to China.<br><br>This married couple went on seperate ways.  I felt sad for them cuz the wife was really a decent lady, totally unlike the kind that we usually hear about.  Then last year, I saw the girlfriend (the one who sent the sms that caused the split up).  She was even younger than the ex wife.  Like a small girl.  Always hold the ang moh's hand and giggle giggle.. She will talk halfway and then give the angmoh a loving stare... piang!  I totally didn't have a good feeling about her.  I could tell that she doesn't know how to take care of the man one (eg. dunno how to bring the guy to a good doc when he's sick or brew good soup when he's not well).  I was hoping that the guy just wanted a companion, cuz his days are quite numbered.<br><br>Everytime they go out, the girl will ask for this and that (all expensive ones!!!).<br><br>A couple of months ago, a mutual friend asked me to recommend bridal studio for them, telling me that the girl wants wedding studio photo - very expensive thing to do leh!!!  I damn buay song this girl liao.  The girl's appetite damn big siah!  Apparently they already ROM.  Now I am not as close to the ang moh as before.  (last time very good friend one with him and his ex wife).  Otherwise, I would go ask him when he is going to ditch this piece of junk.  Somemore not pretty one.</div>

You see a 20 year old in Sg and a 20 year old in China. These two person thinking can be so vastly different its like heaven and earth. There's no comparison at all cause their life, culture, env and everything is different. So they will see things differently. Hence no matter how a guy chooses a girl from another country..  he has to bear in mind there are much cultural, background differences that both had to bridge. Even if she's the same age as he is, their minds can be worlds apart. So it does not always help. Therefore, most sg guys who choose foreign brides need to think carefully. My brother didn't and now his bank account and my parents are empty because of his bitter divorce and he also lost custody of his child. His ex-wife is is 42 and he's about 39. Mental state should be mature. But both are worse than teenagers - selfish and self-centered. Its one of many reasons the family broke up - We single sisters (my sister and i) had to move out to give way to my parent's only son. She bought a 3 room, I rent.<br><br></div>
