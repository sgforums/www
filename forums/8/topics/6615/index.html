I'd prefer somewhat like a open air buffet where everybody can eat to their hearts content and fly off to Honeymoon after that!<br><br>Personally, I feel that wedding dinners are a show of 'face' whereby the bridegroom's family can 'show off' to relatives and friends by making sure that the banquet is held in a Posh hotel and the tables cost at least $100++, etc.<br><br>Heck, what's the use of showing off when you have nothing more to show off AFTER you get married when you are too broke to show off anything?!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wedding Dinner?<br>Hmmm..let me think real hard. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">)<br>My two cents (Singapore cent) worth..I rather pass on the Wedding Dinner. Too commercialised..benefit more to the Caterers rather than the Couple. Well..some may says..no "min fern" to the gal..after "pak taw" so long. It's true..but what if they broke-up. Annulled their wedding..throw another dinners and give another "min fern" to the gal so that others knows she is "on the market" again?...hahaha..no offence ladies.<br><br>That's me...Tommy F14 supersonic...away!!!!!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm... but i think it's nice leh.<br><br>To have the ballroom decorated wif flowers n oh-so-romantic lightings n candles. To prepare the wedding dinner itself is oladi so sweet.<br>The two of us waiting in anticipation for our married life. *sigh* Can juz drown in this kind of lovey dovey feeling.<br>N when the day comes, the two of us stroll down the ballroom during the march-in; the background playing our favourite love song. Feels like being in a fairytale. Awwww... dun u juz luv this kind of feeling?<br>N when we go ard the tables, i'll wipe the sweat of his forehead, he'll meticulously n gentlemanly hold up the train of my evening gown. Heehee... the usual kind of affection dat we've always shown each other... n holding on to the eternal promise of doing dat; loving n caring for each other for the rest of our lives.<br><br>A wedding dinner is nuthin, it's juz a way of telling others dat he's mine n i'm his.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> A joy to share wif our dear ones. N 2 tell my Mummy dat her wildful n stubborn daughter has finally got married.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>ming4 zhong1 ruo4 you3 zhong1 xu1 you3<br>ming4 zhong1 ruo4 wu2 mo4 qiang2 qiu2</div>
