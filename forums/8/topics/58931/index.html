            <div class='col-md body'>If u need more love from someone... do love that someone more first...<br><br>Tree<br>===<br>The reason I'm called tree is because I'm good at painting<br>trees. Overtime I start to use a tree on the right hand corner as a<br>trademark for all my watercolors painting. I have dated 5 gals when I<br>was in Pre-U. There's one gal who I love a lot but never dare go after<br>her. She doesn't have a pretty face, doesn't have a good figure, doesn't<br>have outstanding charm. She is just a very ordinary gal.<br><br>I like her. I really like her. Like her innocent, like her<br>frankness. Like her cuteness, like her intelligence and her fragility.<br>Reason for not going after her is because I felt somebody so ordinary<br>like her is not a good match for me. I'm also afraid that after we are<br>together all the good feelings will vanish. I'm also afraid other's<br>gossips will hurt her. I felt that if she's my gal, she will be mine<br>ultimately &amp; I don't have to give up everything just for her. The last<br>reason, made her accompany me for 3 years.<br><br>She watch me chase after gals, and I have make her heart cry for<br>3 years. She wants to be a good actress and I'm a very demanding<br>director. When I kissed my 2nd girlfriend, she bumped into us. She was<br>embarrassed but smile &amp; say "Go on!" before running off. The next day,<br>her eyes was swollen like a walnut. I purposely didn't want to think<br>about what causes her to cry but laugh at her the whole day. When<br>everybody go back home, she was alone crying in the classroom. She<br>didn't know that I returned from soccer training to get something. I<br>watch her cry for an hour or so.<br><br>My 4th girlfriend didn't like her. There was once when both of<br>them quarreled. I know that based on her character she's not the type<br>that will start off the quarrel. But I still sided with my girlfriend. I<br>shouted at her and her eyes was filled shocked. I didn't care about her<br>feelings and walked off with my girlfriend.<br><br>The next day, she still laugh &amp; joke with me like nothing has<br>ever happened. I know that she's very hurt but she didn't know that my<br>heart ache is as bad as hers.<br><br>When I broke up with my 5th girlfriend, I asked her out. After<br>going out for a day, I told her that I have something to tell her. She<br>told me that coincidentally, she has something to tell me too. I told<br>her about my break up and she told me about her getting together. I know<br>whose the guy. He has been going after her for quite a while. A very<br>cute guy full of energy, lively and interesting. His pursuit for her has<br>been the talk of the school.<br><br>I can't show her my heart ache but could only smile &amp;<br>congratulate her. When I reach home, the heart ache is so strong that I<br>can't stand it. It's like a heavy weighted stone on my chest. I couldn't<br>breath. Wanted to shout but can't. Tears rolled down &amp; I broke down &amp;<br>cry. How many times have I seen her cry for the man that doesn't<br>acknowledge her presence too.<br><br>During graduation, I read a sms in my hp. It was send 10 days<br>ago when I broke down and cry. I haven't read it since then. It says<br>"Leaf departure is because of Wind pursuit. Or because Tree didn't ask<br>her to stay"<br><br>Leaf<br>===<br>During Pre-U days, I like to collect leaves. Why? Because I felt<br>that for a leaf to leave the tree she has been relying on for so long it<br>takes a lot of courage. During the 3 years of Pre-U I was on very close<br>terms with a guy. Not BGR kind but as buddy kind. But when he had his<br>1st girlfriend, I learnt a feeling I never should have learnt -<br>Jealousy. The sourness in the heart can't be described by using a lemon.<br>It's like 100 rotten sour lemon. Sourness to the extreme limit. They<br>were only together for 2 mths. When they<br>broke up, I hide my strong sense of happiness. But after a mth, he got<br>together with another gal.<br><br>I like him &amp; I know he like me. But why won't he pursue me?<br>Since he love me why he doesn't want to make the first move? Whenever he<br>had a new girlfriend, my heart would hurt. Time after time, my heart was<br>hurt. I begin to suspect that this is a one sided love. If he don't like<br>he, why does he treat me so well. It's beyond what you will normally do<br>for a friend. Liking a person is very heart wrenching. I can know his<br>likes, his habits. But his feelings towards me I can never figure out.<br>You can't expect me a gal to ask him right?<br><br>Despite that, I still want to be by his side. Care for him,<br>accompany him, love him. Hoping that one fine day, he will come &amp; love<br>me. It's like waiting for his phone call every night, wanting him to<br>send me sms. I know that no matter how busy he is, he will make time for<br>me. Because of this, I waited for him. The 3 years were the hardest to<br>go through &amp; I really want to give up. Sometimes, I wonder should I<br>continue waiting. The pain and hurt, the dilemma accompany me for 3<br>years.<br><br>Till the end of my 3rd year, a 2nd year junior begins to go<br>after me. Everyday he pursuit me relentlessly. From outright rejection<br>to a point in time when I felt that I'm willing to let him have a small<br>footing in my heart. He's like a warm &amp; gentle wind, trying to blow a<br>leaf away from the tree. In the end, I realized that I didn't want to<br>give this wind a small footing in my heart. I know this wind will bring<br>this badly battered leave far away &amp; better land. Finally I left tree,<br>but the tree only smile &amp; didn't ask me to stay.<br><br>Leaf departure is because of Wind pursuit. Or because Tree<br>didn't ask her to stay<br><br>Wind<br>====<br>Because I like a gal called leaf. Because she's so dependent on<br>tree so I have to be a gust wind. A wind that will blow her away. When I<br>first met her, it was 1 mth after I transfer to the new school. I saw a<br>petite person looking at my seniors &amp; me playing soccer. During ECA<br>time, she will always be sitting there. Be it alone or with her friends<br>looking at him. When he talks with gals there's jealousy in her eyes.<br>When he looked at her, there's a smile in her eyes. Looking at her<br>became my habit. Just like she likes to look at him.<br><br>One day, she didn't appear. I felt something amissed. I can't<br>explain the feeling except it's a kind of uneasiness. The senior was<br>also not there as well. I went to their classroom, hid outside and saw<br>my senior scolding her. Tears were in her eyes while he left. The next<br>day, I saw her at her usual place, looking at him. I walked over and<br>smiled to her. Took out a note &amp; gave to her. She was surprised. She<br>looked at me, smiled &amp; accept the note. The next day, she appeared &amp;<br>pass me a note and left.<br><br>Leaf's heart is too heavy and wind couldn't blow her away<br><br>It's not that leaf heart is too heavy. It because leaf never<br>want to leave tree<br><br>I replied her note with this statement and slowly she started to<br>talk to me &amp; accept my presents &amp; phone calls. I know that the person<br>she loves is not me. But I have this perseverance that one day I will<br>make her like me. Within 4 mths, I have declared my love for her no less<br>than 20 times. Every time, she will divert away from the topic. But I<br>never give up. If I decide I want her to be mine, I will definitely use<br>all means to win her over. I can't remember how many times I have<br>declared my love to her.<br><br>Although I know she will try to divert but I still bear a small<br>ray of hope. Hoping that she will agree to me my girlfriend. I didn't<br>hear any reply from her over the phone. I asked "what are you doing? How<br>come you didn't want to reply?" She said, "I'm nodding my head". "Ah?" I<br>couldn't believe my ears. "I'm nodding my head" She replied loudly. I<br>hang up the phone, quickly changed and took a taxi and rush to her place<br>&amp; press her door bell. During the moment when she opens the door. I<br>hugged her tightly.<br><br>Leaf departure is because of Wind pursuit. Or because Tree<br>didn't ask her to stay.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
