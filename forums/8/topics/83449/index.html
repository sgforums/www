            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm...I watch a documentary regarding the life in Afghanistan after the U.S drove the Taliban out of Afghanistan and during U.S occupation there.<br><br>The people who is involved in the production of that documentary is being threatened by U.S soldiers...some killed or went missing mysteriously in Afghanistan during the filming of that documentary.<br><br>This is true...Singapore will probably never air this documentary, I watched it in Australia last year on channel SBS (This channel  aired movies/documentaries from all over the world).<br><br>You know what those U.S soldiers did to the Afghanistan people during their occupation there? They round up those Afghanistan people suspected of being involved in Taliban activities and put them all in those lorries containers and transport them to a faraway prison in the middle of the Afghanistan desert. During the transportation, the so-called prisoners were denied food, water and rest and air. You can imagined the temperature inside those containers packed full of people. It took them days to reach that prison and when they arrived, the containers are full of dead people, human waste and sick people.<br><br>There was an incident where the people in those containers complained the lack of oxygen inside the containers as the ventilation holes are not enough to provide sufficient oxygen to everybody in the containers. You know what those U.S soldiers did to gave them more air in the containers? They stopped the containers and opened fired on the containers with their machine guns to punch the ventilation holes into the containers. Plenty of people died instantly in those containers...after that, nobody dared to complain about the air anymore.<br><br>I feel sad for those people who are mistreated without respect by those U.S soldiers. But who did anything about it? So I must tell you...the people who are reading this. The incident regarding the U.S soldiers taking lewd pictures of those prisoners in Iraq is not the first incident to take place...but rather the first incident to be reported to the public...that's all.<br><br>I have no respect for U.S soldiers whatsoever after watching that documentary. I can understand the anger for those people whose relatives/loved ones were once mistreated by U.S soldiers...but I'm not terrorist, never going to be a terrorist. Just want to uncover the truth that had been hidden from us by the media to the people reading here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
