Anyway, you are not even worth to be mentioned in my honour list of attention seekers.<br>What you do is just swim around here and there in the forums and practically contribute ZERO useful thread in this forums. But I gotta take my hats off you. You can create 3000 over posts by simply swimming around this forums and still doesnt get tired. This is the ONLY THING that you got me taking my hat off you.<br><br>cheerS!<br><br>------------------<br>I hear funeral bells..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hehe, guess I have caught your attention?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Well, I didn't thought that what I post would be able to catch anyone's attention except NiVleK. I am not used to writing lengthy replies, so I tend to keep my reply short.<br>Well, what will be considered as a contribution to the forum? I did post my opinions on certain topics which I have something to add, maybe you missed out on that?<br>Anyway, at least I find my replies pretty harmless, with no intentional to hurt. Unless you are hurt by love, I guess you wont mind my flirting with NiVleK.<br>On the internet, most people do not tend to be that serious and likes to keep things light- hearted. Besides, we are all here to enjoy ourselves and to relieve stress from our daily life isn't it?<br>I guess FnU didnt intentionally seek attention. It is more of his nick. He may not be the type of guy that will swept a girl of her feet, but he is definately not what his nick implies. That's where he got his attention from.<br>As for FireIce and Hello Kitty, it is their characteristic to be free and easy-going. I guess that's what makes them adorable and adds so spice into the forums.<br>My apologies if what I said has annoyed you so much but I didn't meant to cause you any inconviences.<br>Just enjoy yourself here and don't think too much.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>**I want u to be with me.....<br>be with me in the morning...be with me in the nite...with me when its dark out...with me when its light...<br>I want u to be with me...no matter what we do...just keep this reminder...of how much I love u...**</div>
