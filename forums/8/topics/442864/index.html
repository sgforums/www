            <div class='col-md body'><p><span class="postbody"><span style="font-size: x-small;">I spent about $2000 and entitled to redeem a Nikon camera but was told by the redemption counter @ Taka B2 that it was fully redeemed. The redemption counter then told me to come next day for the redemption. I went on Saturday morning, around 10.20am, &amp; they told me i can't redeem as the promotion is meant for same day redemption only. I had a heated arguments with the counter manager who kept saying that he can't do anything except asking me to call DBS Customer Service. He said they are engaged by DBS but not directly from DBS, hence can't make decision. <br><br>There was another lady also made a scene there as she was frustrated that at 10.10am all if was fully redeemed. The redemption counter open at 10am. <br>She shouted that it is impossible that it was fully redeem as most of the shops either open @ 10.00am or 11am. It was ridiculous. <br><br>Anyway, i am at a loss, just need advise of what will you do if this happen to you. Thanks.</span></span></p></div>

              <p>The Nikon camera can be redeemed for the first 30 person of the day.</p>
              <p>It is highly impossible that all the redemption for the 30 individual who queued up for the camera to be processed within 10minutes, there are process work that needs to be done including verify of the receipt and NRIC for documentation. I can understand why the lady was so frustrated and furious.</p>
              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="icon_exclaim.gif"> The T&amp;C indeed state that it was meant for the same day redemption only.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This case has two side but DBS is clearly the winner.</p>
              <p><strong>Case 1)</strong> Only the first 30 person of the day, who spent $1800 and above, can redeem the prize. Unless you are very sure that you made purchases early in the day, chances are they will say "you are not the 1st 30 person, so you're not entitled to the prize"</p>
              <p><strong>Case 2)</strong> Redemption counter informed you that you can come to redeem the prize the next day. This is clearly the person behind the counter's fault for providing you an incorrect answer. Whether or not you like it, the usual PR respond will be "we will informed the relevant personel to be more careful next time". No prize will be given out for such errors.</p>
              <p>I know it's kinda hard for you to swollow the fact, but let me tell you. DBS is a good bank, and if you are able to get directly to the marketing manager or the deputy of this campaign and tell him/her that you're a loyal customer of DBS for so many years, chances are, you might still get your prize even though you're not entitled to.</p>
