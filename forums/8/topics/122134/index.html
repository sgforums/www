            <div class='col-md body'>Got this from the net.. Pray tell me, how to trust girls..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Well, about half a year ago i got to know this girl from Friendster. She was a year younger than me and owns her own franchise and stuff. We eventually met up.<br><br>First impressions weren't great. She was plump, and seriously i've only dated girls who could pass off as models before her. This time round however, i managed to see past the weight issue (she had a pretty face anyway) and we started dating each other.<br><br>I must admit that ever since i had sex with my second girlfriend when i was 23, i had gotten into various other relationships that always resulted in sex. This time round however i was pretty adamant that we keep it pure, a fresh start for the two of us. (Side note: She has had a crazy sex-life, chinese guys like me, indians, caucasians...) I'm not some adolecent with fantasies of getting a virgin girlfriend in this day and age, but then again, her sex life really shocked me too haha... But AGAIN, "love" brought me past that.<br><br>Anyway two months down the road, we started "exploring" each other's body. I kept to my promise and never let things go too far. However she was forever tempting me with invitations to "see how far we can go". That by itself would result in sex, i saw it of couse, but again lust worked its subtle magic, and eventually we had sex. It was great, our lust for each other was equally great, and we made love almost every single day we met.<br><br>Another month passed and we were starting to plan for the future. It was then that she dropped the bombshell on me. That she was actually having a relationship with her boss (who's 20 bloody years older than she is, divorcee with a kid, has millions to his name, drives a damn ugly Porsche). To make things worse, she was STILL in a relationship with him.<br><br>I was devastated, but even then i was willing to forgive and forget, if she would leave him. However, that guy would not let her go. Even went as far as to threaten to recall the money he lent (note: LENT not gave) her for her business, to kill himself, to kill me, blah blah... Pretty sickening and childish for a 40+ yr old man. Sometimes it was threats, sometimes he called up the happy times they shared together. But the simple fact that he would fling vulgarities at her at work and even hit her, kick her voided all his lies about "love". No one around her supports her being with him either.<br><br>She was determined to leave him and even formally offered to repay him her debts in installments, which i also offered to help in. And he suddenly switched tactics. Becoming the kind, understanding man he isn't. I should have known he would not let it end this way, not when it would seem that he was dumped. His ego would not allow that. Anyway i was busy with work as well and she seemed busy with work too, but constantly she would assure me that everything was settled.<br><br>However right after Valentine's day, i decided to hop into her Blog which she seldom even goes in (but which i knew of back in our Friendster days). And guess what? She had admitted in her blog that she had gone back to having a relationship with her boss. That she felt bad about two timing me, but she was unable to forget the love she had for him. And when he made his move on her yet again that week (which he tries all the time, asking her to go his house for last minute stuff, and which she had resisted so far), she did not resist and they had sex. She felt that to this date she still loved him more than me. But of course she admitted that material needs played a big part as well. That he was able to provide for her what i couldn't.<br><br>This time round my world just came crumbling down on me. I gave up all the pre-requisites that i always looked for in a girl, for her. I chose not to mind her past. I gave her more love than i had ever given anyone ever. Yet she chose to forsake all that we've planned together. Our dreams. Our hopes. Just because some man who's 20 yrs older than her can provide for her. Hell, if i'm his age so would i be able to! What kind of comparison is that? Eventually i understood that she wanted instant gratification. Instant wealth. Instant success. Like many girls do i suppose. He decides if her business rises or falls. He could crush her anytime she wanted to. And despite her family and my assurance that we would help her start anew (she's still young after all), she chose not to risk it all. I don't think i can blame her for that, after all how long have we known each other? But i cannot forgive her.<br><br>Well i went ballistic after that, letting my hormones lead me down whichever path that appears. In a self-destruct mode i guess. Waking up... but i wonder if its too late? Perhaps God had decided that enough chances had been given to me? Opened the Bible just the other day and i saw something like: Unrepentant Judah! You shall be wiped out in 3 months time. LOL... Faintz.<br><br>Just to share. Pretty long as usual. Bros, i'm sure everyone has their reasons for doing the things they do. Some bros are here simply cos they do not see any wrong in what they do. Some like me had known once a long time ago that this is all wrong, yet somewhere along the way they had fallen and sunken so deep that they do not feel a trace of remorse anymore today. Yet there is still hope i believe, for us to gain back the moral ground that we had lost.<br><br>Sex is not love. Yet it is love that we really want. Sex is just the rush of hormones screaming to be released, and easily overcome in the quiet recesses of the toilet cubicle. Do you remember when you were in love? Lust had no place in your heart then. There was only one girl you thought of, one girl you ever wanted, and one girl you never wanted to hurt.<br><br>Treasure the one who trusted you with her life. Love her as if this were the last chance you'll ever have. Who knows? Sometimes because of this, you'll never come to the end of the road.<br></div>

She was a pleasant and innocent looking student...from a local uni..We met and got together not long after as we were mutually attracted to each other .Due to her busy schedule and family restrictions, we met about once every two months or even less..<br>She would call me everytime she has problems with studies and I would always try to help her..<br>Of course..we would also meet up for great sex regularly..soon after<br><br>Recently, I was wondering why she didnt call me up and only upon calling her, I found out that she has been seeing this guy in his thirties from another forum for a month already. To my shock, she even confessed that she has had sex with him already....Further more, she also confessed to me that she has had sex with other guys from IRC..total of 15 guys...and she even got pregnant last year ....<br><br>Guess what I told her...I said I dun mind as long as u are honest with me...but pls do not hurt me further...and her reply was ....ask me to wait for 6 months...after she decide whether this sammyboy chatter in his thirties is meant for her....I was utterly disappointed....I was betrayed...and she still has the cheek to ask me to wait...<br><br>She told me that I didnt gave her enough attention due to my busy schedule and thus she feel that I was toying with her and thus she seek attention from other guys by having sex with them...She said that we have been meeting for sex and it seems that I only wanted sex from her which is not true....She is a regular chatter there with two nicks...I was betrayed..<br><br>From now on, I promised myself never to trust gals from online..dun ever put 100% of ur trust in any gal ...</div>

You must keep her on a tight rein..<br><br>Women want total freedom or rather to call things by their names - total licence.. If you allow them to achieve complete equality with men, do you think they will be easier to live with? Not at all.. Once they have achieved equality, they will be your masters..<br><br>In fact the scene have changed drastically.. Last time, a man choose a woman for its gentleness, demure kind but now its different.. It is the girl who accepts / doesn't accept a potential suitor.. And guys compete with each other to impress the girl..  A guy's eligibility is determined by how many C's he possessed..<br><br>I don't know what it will lead to.. But, it will be catastrophe if it continues.. Sometimes, I just can't fathom whats going on in their pea brain.. They want equality yet they won't accept being in a stronger position..

You must keep her on a tight rein..<br><br>Women want total freedom or rather to call things by their names - total licence.. If you allow them to achieve complete equality with men, do you think they will be easier to live with? Not at all.. Once they have achieved equality, they will be your masters..<br><br>In fact the scene have changed drastically.. Last time, a man choose a woman for its gentleness, demure kind but now its different.. It is the girl who accepts / doesn't accept a potential suitor.. And guys compete with each other to impress the girl..  A guy's eligibility is determined by how many C's he possessed..<br><br>I don't know what it will lead to.. But, it will be catastrophe if it continues.. Sometimes, I just can't fathom whats going on in their pea brain.. They want equality yet they won't accept being in a stronger position.. The men in Singapore dont have the privilege of assuming a weaker position and demand the other sex to do the work but my friend Peter is often label as a wimp or not assertive enough for local ladies..</div></blockquote>20 years ago the scenario in sg was different..women were limited to mostly the kitchen and as a result they were not influenced by the ills of the outside..what do i see now.....women who have become the ills themselves...they have become choosy and materialistic......</div>
