              <p>This guy William Gibson wrote about singpore lah......</p>
              <p>here i copy paste for you.....</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: large;"><strong>Disneyland with the Death Penalty</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: xx-small;"> <em>By William Gibson</em> </span>  </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">"It's like an entire country run by Jeffrey Katzenberg," the producer had
              said, "under the motto 'Be happy or I'll kill you.'" We were sitting in an
              office a block from Rodeo Drive, on large black furniture leased with
              Japanese venture capital. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Now that I'm actually here, the Disneyland metaphor is proving impossible to
              shake. For that matter, Rodeo Drive comes frequently to mind, though the
              local equivalent feels more like 30 or 40 Beverly Centers put end to end. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">;-) </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Was it Laurie Anderson who said that VR would never look real until they
              learned how to put some dirt in it? Singapore's airport, the Changi
              Airtropolis, seemed to possess no more resolution than some early VPL world.
              There was no dirt whatsoever; no muss, no furred fractal edge to things.
              Outside, the organic, florid as ever in the tropics, had been gardened into
              brilliant green, and all-too-perfect examples of itself. Only the clouds were
              feathered with chaos - weird columnar structures towering above the Strait of
              China. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The cab driver warned me about littering. He asked where I was from. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">He asked if it was clean there. "Singapore very clean city." One of those
              annoying Japanese-style mechanical bells cut in as he exceeded the speed
              limit, just to remind us both that he was doing it. There seemed to be golf
              courses on either side of the freeway. . . . </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">"You come for golf?" </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">"No." </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">"Business?" </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">"Pleasure." </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">He sucked his teeth. He had his doubts about that one. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Singapore is a relentlessly G-rated experience, micromanaged by a state that
              has the look and feel of a very large corporation. If IBM had ever bothered
              to actually possess a physical country, that country might have had a lot in
              common with Singapore. There's a certain white-shirted constraint, an
              absolute humorlessness in the way Singapore Ltd. operates; conformity here is
              the prime directive, and the fuzzier brands of creativity are in extremely
              short supply. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><em>The physical past here has almost entirely vanished.</em> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">There is no slack in Singapore. Imagine an Asian version of Zurich operating
              as an offshore capsule at the foot of Malaysia; an affluent microcosm whose
              citizens inhabit something that feels like, well, Disneyland. Disneyland with
              the death penalty. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">But Disneyland wasn't built atop an equally peculiar 19th-century theme park
              - something constructed to meet both the romantic longings and purely
              mercantile needs of the British Empire. Modern Singapore was - bits of the
              Victorian construct, dressed in spanking-fresh paint, protrude at quaint
              angles from the white-flanked glitter of the neo-Gernsbackian metropolis.
              These few very deliberate fragments of historical texture serve as a reminder
              of just how deliciously odd an <em>entrepot</em> Singapore once was - a product
              of Empire kinkier even than Hong Kong. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The sensation of trying to connect psychically with the old Singapore is
              rather painful, as though Disneyland's New Orleans Square had been erected on
              the site of the actual French Quarter, obliterating it in the process but
              leaving in its place a glassy simulacrum. The facades of the remaining
              Victorian shop-houses recall Covent Garden on some impossibly bright London
              day. I took several solitary, jet-lagged walks at dawn, when a city's ghosts
              tend to be most visible, but there was very little to be seen of previous
              realities: Joss stick smouldering in an old brass holder on the white-painted
              column of a shop-house; a mirror positioned above the door of a supplier of
              electrical goods, set to snare and deflect the evil that travels in a
              straight line; a rusty trishaw, chained to a freshly painted iron railing.
              The physical past, here, has almost entirely vanished. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><em>Today's Singapore is far more precisely the result of Lee Kuan
              Yew's vision than the Manchester of the East ever was of Sir Stamford
              Raffles'.</em> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">In 1811, when Temenggong, a local chief, arrived to resettle Singapura, the
              Lion City, with a hundred Malays, the jungle had long since reclaimed the
              ruins of a 14th-century city once warred over by Java, Siam, and the Chinese.
              A mere eight years later came Sir Stamford Raffles, stepping ashore amid a
              squirming tangle of kraits and river pirates, to declare the place a splendid
              spot on which to create, from the ground up, a British trading base. It was
              Raffles's singular vision to set out the various colonial jewels in Her
              Majesty's crown as distinct ethnic quarters: here Arab Street, here Tanjong
              Pagar (Chinese), here Serangoon Road (Indian). And Raffles's theme park
              boomed for 110 years - a free port, a <em>Boy's Own</em> fantasy out of Talbot
              Mundy, with every human spice of Asia set out on a neatly segmented tray of
              sturdy British china: "the Manchester of the East." A very hot ticket 
              indeed.</span></p>

              <p>Sometimes or perhpas in a lot of times Mr. ruler use these kind of  masquerading  to get to his intended target. I'm not accusing but it's a possibility especially when they are always uncaught by the police.</p>
