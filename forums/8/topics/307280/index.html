              <p>A gang of about 20 youths wielding knives and sticks slashed and hit him ruthlessly.</p>
              <p>Mr Terence Tan ended up with more than 20 slashes on his head, arms and back.</p>
              <p>The worst part is, up to this day, the 26-year-old former logistics assistant doesn't know who his assailants are and why they attacked him.</p>
              <p>A case of mistaken identity? No one knows. What lingers on are the physical and emotional scars.</p>
              <p>Now, Mr Tan is afraid to go home - a three-room flat at Bedok Reservoir that he shares with his mother, 50, and his sister, 20, an undergraduate at Nanyang Technological University.</p>
              <p>His father died four years ago.</p>
              <p>Most of the time, Mr Tan is at his aunty's place in Siglap.</p>
              <p>When he goes out, he makes sure someone goes along with him.</p>

              <p>'I get scared when I see crowds. It just reminds me of the attack,' Mr Tan said in Mandarin.</p>
              <p>The incident occurred on 12 Jan. Mr Tan was waiting to get a taxi to go to Bugis Junction, when he saw groups of young people walking around the estate.</p>
              <p>Mr Tan said: 'There were four or five groups, and they looked like they were searching for someone. Some were armed with knives, others had poles and umbrellas.</p>
              <p>'One of them walked towards me with a knife, and I panicked. As I turned, I saw him jump at me. He then started to slash at my head.'</p>
              <p>His attacker was soon joined by his friends, who started hitting and slashing at Mr Tan too. He fell to the ground and used his left arm to fend off the attack.</p>
              <p>The brutal assault lasted five minutes before the youths ran off.</p>
              <p>Mr Tan staggered off to look for help, blood streaming from his head. A passer-by helped him to call for an ambulance, and he was sent to Changi General Hospital.</p>

              <p>'My mother saw me all bloodied and almost fainted. I also thought I would die because I was in so much pain,' he said.</p>
              <p>He spent one week in hospital with two days in the intensive care unit. He had two cuts on his head, six on his arms, and numerous slashes on his back.</p>
              <p>'I can't move two of my fingers. The doctor said that one of the nerves has been almost severed,' he added.</p>
              <p>Mr Tan said he is not involved in gang-related activities and has not offended anyone lately.</p>
              <p>The police said that no one has been arrested yet in connection with this case and they are still investigating.</p>
