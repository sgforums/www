            <div class='col-md body'>colette:<br><br>Dearest, I have to thank thee for thy praises first, though I have to admit that there was an attempt to make you look like a subject of my egoistical experiment, I apologise for that arrogance. But I do not like to make woman look like fools, for I would prefer to be the fool that entertains. And colette my dear, of course you are not the one, and how intelligent you are to point out that there were only 5 post between us, and that it would not be possible. So you never did fall for any trick even if there may be one right? See, honeypot, I am attracted to woman who always understand what I am thinking, and yes, you did see through quite a lot of me, my ploting and die hard attempt to trap you in a corner, but I guess I was too flirty for my own good, and was tempted to flirt with shervon, else you would have fallen would you not? *sigh* To tell the truth I am still trying to get rid of the habit, but it is one herculean task for a man like me.<br><br>If you would really like to know who the girl is, I can give you a hint, or shall I say you all a hint, I have even less exchange with her on the forum than you colette, hmmm....or maybe at most about the same, and that she does not frequent here much. So did anyone managed to guess who could have ensnared the buaya kings' heart, so much that he would give up his crown?<br><br>To the one who got my heart:<br>*winks* If you see this, dear, have a nice day.<br><br>Shervon:<br><br>Dun worry shervon, I am still sane here, you have not made me crazy for you yet, *laffs* but I guess, I did throw you a bit off balance, but not to worry, I do not bully, so shall we be friends rather than cyber flirt partners, it would do you more good for you have baggage and I do not have it yet.<br><br>To Shervon's dear:<br>Now dun worry about me, I am just a passing cloud, dropping some raindrops along the way, I sure hope that the raindrops did not cause too large a ripple though. A thousand apologies if it did. But I doubt so, for I think that you would be a great gentleman to have the heart of a fine young lady like shervon.<br><br>To all:<br><br>Hmm... so anyone else wants to apply to be a friend? It would help in my reform process if I have less people to flirt with, so any kind soul out there?<br><br>[This message has been edited by Callan (edited 01 April 2000).]</div>

I am trying to quit you, but those constant words of your echos in my mind, I just could not, I might be a failure because I am falling for you, but I dun care anymore of right andwrong, I just know that you are what I need most now.

I do not think so, but the lady in question sure would be envious of you, for even she did not make me lose my rational mind, but you did...isn't that comforting to know?<br><br>Reply me soon my love potion, for I know not how long I can do without you, unless you want me to quit you else, please do write soon.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tet<br>To say to trust a person is difficult unless time plays a part in making it true...The basic element in a relationship is trust...and sincerity...all bodes well if both of them merge and come as one...and to put ur trust into something risk-taking is really a gamble...I shall say maybe a relationship is a gamble?<br>True.....and thus I shall seek the truth....<br><br>Callan<br>It does not matter if I believe u, it matters most if the lady of yours believes in you.

            <div class='col-md body'>Mega:<br><br>Well, I am sorry , if I have hurt you in anyway. But frankly speaking it is a bad way to explain yourself to say that you are only 17 and that Rinoa is 21. *Grinz* In this forum age is not a matter of discussion. *smiles* But since you are still so young, 17, we get the point. *laffs*<br><br>Well, what you say might come sincerely from your heart, but I hope you have learnt something through this, Rinoa most probably will scream her disagreement to me over ICQ if I were to say this but what the heck, hope that by now you have understand that everyone have different interpretations to the same words. You might mean one thing but people might not think that way at all. You can say whatever you want deep from your heart, but if others doubt your words or intention, then such actions or words will just backfire. This is especially true if the persons involved are not even close to you, much less to say, like us who do not know you at all. Well, of course you can still carry on being true to yourself. That is one trait I always encourage, but you still got to learnt how to protect yourself, for though you are being true, the rest may not, and they may think that you are not too. You can either outsmart them, by knowing what to say and when to say it, or you can just be nonchalant and ignore everyone's remakr, for they just plainly do not understand you.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Well, for me, I employ both and see when it is suitable.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>As for flirting here, *laffs* most of us are just having fun, I am sure you have seen my posts in other forums, if you are who I think you are, you know my post are normally long and serious.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> But here, since almost everyone knows everyone(the regulars I meant). We have a fun time flirting with each other and teasing each other about it later on. Maybe it is the age group we are in, (20 - 25) that makes us so. For we might have come to a stage whereby we know the differences between social flirting and real relationships. Maybe it is our personalities. We are a fun bunch, and we are mostly outgoing and friendly. And yes, I still flirt alot even in outings, but all in the name of fun, nothing serious and everyone knows it and plays along. I am thankful for such company. Hope it explains our behaviour to you.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by Callan (edited 04 April 2000).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by Callan (edited 04 April 2000).]</div>

The suggestions she gave me made a lot of sense. Made me think as well. Well, though I have never met her, but I think she has helped me and deserves a thank you.<br>Thanks Rinoa for listening (or more like reading) my  problems.
