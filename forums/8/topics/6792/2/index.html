I often ask myself, now is the time for the test, Colette dear, would you? Would you go for a younger man with a heart of passion but not so intelligent as Terence, not so poetic as Proddy, not so witty as Barclays, not so romantic as ray, like me? My heart yearns to be closer, even an inch would bring me to paradise.  So say yes, for a lone wolf is in the making, reject this and the lone wolf would be complete.<br><br>p.s Is the little bird who I am thinking he is?</div>

So happy that I have her as my friend.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> When I am in need, she is always there to comfort me. She helped me go through the "hump" my my "love life." Can still remember the december of 1999. Rinoa came to visit  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Wah lau, that time damn malu. Lost my wallet. inside got all my cash. Although I only know her for a short period of time, she even lend me some $$ to get by. (Don't worry, I return it all liao.) ^^She even treated me sushi somemore. I can still remember how the way she slept like a pig in the car, during our trip to Settle, and the disgusted look on her face when she talked to my friend's pervert cousin..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> . I really enjoyed our talks about cars, basektball, girls. hehe. Although I look like shit, she didn't mind at all, and was willing to make friend with me. This shows that she does not judge a book by its cover.<br>Not to say that she is not tricky at times. Sigh. Just got tricked by her today. The photo. I didn't know I was so stupid  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>Well, there is always more to say, but I will stop here.

Was age ever a barrier? I often ask myself, now is the time for the test, Colette dear, would you? Would you go for a younger man with a heart of passion but not so intelligent as Terence, not so poetic as Proddy, not so witty as Barclays, not so romantic as ray, like me? My heart yearns to be closer, even an inch would bring me to paradise.  So say yes, for a lone wolf is in the making, reject this and the lone wolf would be complete.<br><br>p.s Is the little bird who I am thinking he is?</blockquote>when i first read this in the wee hours this morning, my heart just melted, really, it literally melted &amp; i went to bed really happy. i have never been more touched, i was too tired to do justice to any reply i could post at that late hour &amp; thought i shall reply tonight. well, excuuusse me for harbouring false hopes! i guess thereÂ’s no need now, Callan darling, is there?<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Callan on 31 Mar, 9.52 am:<br>Shervon:<br><br>Well, I am thinking about it, and will slowly fade it off, and I still need to see if I still have it once in a while. *winks* So who want to be the lucky gal when I need to prove something? </blockquote><blockquote>Originally posted by Callan on 31 Mar, 5.59 pm:<br>Shervon:<br><br>Can you still see the fire in me then?

It just means you will be serious when you've found that 'someone' and whenever you're around her, you dun flirt in front of her.
