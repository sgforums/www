I think he made a mistake by posting in the wrong forum. Haha, that's so funny. It's like the TS is complainting in the wrong department and we have to refer the TS to the other department. Wonder if the other department will tell him that "he will have to write in and it will take 3 days to process..."  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

He's saying something about our government and our ignorance of the lack of human rights in Singapore specifically things like the death penalty and severe punishment for such minor crimes which shouldn't even be crimes in the first place like spitting and chewing gum, etc.</div>
