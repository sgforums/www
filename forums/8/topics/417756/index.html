              <p>There's nothing particularly good or bad about FTs. They're people just like us. The government's intention to allow a huge influx of foreigners to compete in the local job market in order to spur us is well-meant, but as the saying goes, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.</p>

              <p>I thought of complaining to the authorities but my friend told
              me forget about it. As the stall will not last for 3 months. And it
              fact, saw customers returning their poa or siew-mie also. Probably
              due to sour and not hot.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What I want to say is the attitude of the prc ladies maning the
              store is terrible and horrible.</p>

              <p>I think there's a cultural difference there. I ever bought a nice addidas bag a few years ago in this boutique, when i got my credit card back, it was with one hand and no thank you and no eye contact. Haha wth, small incident but a real eye opener on their service culture.</p>

              <p>Actually I have met pilots who are singaporeans....no they dun fly with SIA. They've been rejected by SIA before and they now ply their trade in places like australia, africa, china and southeast asia....doing those general aviation commercial flying. I've personally spoken to them before and they don't look in any way less prefessional than the many many malaysian pilots in SIA??</p>
              <p>I dunno....how ironical, Msia protects their locals by not hiring unexperienced foreign pilots....look at air asia, they have many young malaysians in there and they are growing like hell. And here in SIA, the policy remains unchanged..that is that the talents are always out there. They even went as far as HK and india to get cadets.</p>
