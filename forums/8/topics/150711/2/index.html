            <div class='col-md body'>Hurricane Katrina is a reminder to Bush that other than fighting terrorist and Iraq, there are more pressing issues at home waiting for him to tackle.<br><br>According to the Sunday Times (4 Sept 2005 P12 Questions, Questions) : <blockquote>Before 911, the Federal Emergency Management Agency listed the three most likely catastrophic disasters facing the US......a hurricane strike on New Orleans...</blockquote>Since it has been predicted many years ago, how could America be caught unawares?<br><br><blockquote>After 2003, the Army Corps of Engineers sharply slowed down its floodwork control, including work on the sinking levees. "The corps", an editor and publisher article says,..."never tried to hide the fact that the spending pressures of the war in Iraq, as well as homeland security - coming at the same time as federal tax cuts - was the reason for the strain".</blockquote>This shows that if the US had not fought a war in Iraq, or reduced the budget for the corps, maybe the levees would be in a better condition to withstand Hurricane Katrina's onslaught and might not have broken.<br><br>Nevertheless, it has alreadly happened. President Bush should quickly restore law and order to New Orleans and save the people still trapped in New Orleans; make sure such a disaster never happens again.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Shame on George Bush &amp; his Administration on the way they handled the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina that devastated the Gulf States, particularly New Orleans, Louisiana.<br><br>One nagging question; has the predominantly 68% of poor &amp; black population of New Orleans got anything to do with the slow reaction to evacuate and rescue or is it because the incapable George Bush is not responsive enough to deal immediately with the total devastation left by Katrina. As President he has to be held responsible for all those who starved to death and those who suffered terribly during the 5-6 days because of his indecisiveness.<br><br>On Christmas Eve of 1975, 30 yrs ago, Darwin the capital city of Australia Northern Territory was totally wiped out by Cyclone Tracy. The Australian Government from Canberra immediately ordered their national airline, Qantas and all military transport air-crafts to evacuate the whole population of about 50,000 - 60,000 from the Northern Territory to the other major cities within 3 days.<br><br>Thereafter, Darwin was immediately rebuilt and all her population returned within months.<br><br>Today America, the world's most powerful &amp; wealthiest nation has unlimited resources compared to what Australia had 30 years ago, but yet George Bush chose to drag his blardy feet in handling the devastation in New Orleans while the poor &amp; black folks were left to starve &amp; die during the 5-6 days before he acted decisively.<br><br>He was quick to invade Iraq and his response during 9/11 in NY (Blacks are minority) was immediate. In war-torn Iraq they were able to build a fully equipped hospital within 24 hrs; why can't they do the same in New Orleans, in their own country?<br><br>If not for the emotional appeal through radio made by Mayor Nagin of New Orleans, Bush probably would still be directing the rescue operations from his cushy White House oval office and not made a visit to the devastated states to see the disaster 1st hand for himself. And food, water &amp; medicine would still not be made available to be provided to the poor &amp; black victims of New Orleans.<br><br>George Bush, the moron, ought to step down immediately from his presidency.<br><br></div>
