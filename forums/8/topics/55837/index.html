Not this driver' (ST, Aug 26), by Madam Wendy Lim Hsui Giok.<br><br>Sending an SMS message with one hand while driving a vehicle with the other constitutes an offence of Handphone Driving which can lead to a fine of up to $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term up to six months, or both. One may also be disqualified from driving all classes of vehicles for up to six months.<br><br>Using a mobile phone while driving distracts drivers and reduces their ability to control their vehicles and to react to changes in road situations. It is irresponsible and puts the lives of road users at risk.<br><br>Motorists who wish to use their phones are advised to have their passenger make or receive the call. Motorists who are driving alone can receive urgent calls through a hands-free device but should keep their conversation short. They can return the calls or continue with the conversation at a more appropriate time.<br><br>Passengers who notice their drivers using a phone while driving can play their part by advising the driver to refrain from doing so.<br><br>We request Madam Lim to contact Deputy Superintendent of Police Richard Lim Cher Khin on 6547-6104 to provide further information on the violation she noted so that we can look into the matter.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So your justification is, if they can drive recklessly, it's okay for me to do something that's dangerous also as well, as long as it is not as bad as them.<br><br>Next time somebody cut off all your limbs I guess I can poke your eyes out and feel okay about it, because it's not so zialat.<br><br>Bah, your justification of sms while driving is like a person who smokes while filling petrol saying that at least they are not speeding or racing illegaly.<br><br>What you say about other drivers does not detract one bit from the fact that what you are doing is not only dangerous, but stupid.<br><br>Taking one hand off the wheel and dividing your motor function attention towards keying in a message, even if you do not look at the screen, means that your reaction time and reflexes are greatly compromised. All this while you are behind a half ton piece of metal travelling at over 60kph.<br><br>SMSing during driving is blatantly a stupid idea, no matter how you try to justify it or say you have skill... it reeks of stupidity... I mean you end up killing yourself nevermind, remove yourself from the genepool and improve humanity's genetic stock. But it's rarely that way, other people like motorcyclists and pedestrians are at the mercy of your unthinking, callous behaviour.<br><br>It's never about you.<br><br>Remember the joker who killed 4 people at the bus stop some time back? He just ploughed straight into the bus stop at high speed. What was he doing? Using his hand phone...<br></div>
