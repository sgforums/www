            <div class='col-md body'>I can always sense ppl looking at me. Serious! Even when my arse's facing them! Coz when i turn them, i always catch the person looking at me.<br><br>Even at times, when my frds are i get a bit lost in a crowded place. I can walk towards them &amp; when i reach them and carry on walking, they can shout at me and asked me y i never c them! I'll tell them i saw them dat's y i was there. Then they'll asked me y they never c me looking at them. I never say anything... coz it's in me. I can c u even when my eyes' not looking at u.<br><br>That's not the only example. I juz have a very accurate sense in dat. Juz dun like it &amp; dun feel comfortable when ppl's looking at me.<br><br>Some time back, in the middle of the 7th month, i was getting very worried. I kept sensing this presense in my room. Didn't dare tell anyone... coz i scared it'll come after me.<br><br>It's not dat frequent anymore. Except when i'm out in the hall, it'll suddenly pop out, stand at a corner or edge &amp; watched me. Dun tell me it's my imagination!!!<br><br>The first time... i was so scared. I can tell u it was rite in front of me. My computer table is in front of my bed. I had actually feel very uneasy dat nite as i was typing away on my pc. When i got into bed, i know dat thing was siting in the chair &amp; looking at me.<br><br>What can i do to appease his soul? I'm scared &amp; losing slp over this. Sometimes when i can get to slp in bed, i will juz look at the spot where i know he's at.<br><br>It's driving me crazy!!! I want it out of my life!!!<br><br>Dun tell me cock advise! I nit spiritual help!<br><br>------------------<br><strong>I thought that you'd be loving me.<br>I thought you were the one who'd stay forever.<br>But now forever's come and gone<br>And I'm still here alone.</strong></div>
