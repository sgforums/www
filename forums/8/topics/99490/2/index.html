As for taking responsibility, isnt aborting the baby a way of taking reponsibility for this action? In fact Lack of preparations for Parenthood would be an irresponsibility in this case.

U go ask them lor. yes I have met ppl who are involved in abortion b4.<br><br>As for the part on the doctor's explanation, All doctors are required by the law to fully explain the risk and consequences to a patient before the patient undergoes a major operation. So what makes you so sure that if doctors had fully explained, those ppl wont go for abortion? Ppl go for abortion for different reasons. To some, the risk of infertility is nothing compared to the heavy responsibility in future.<br><br>Oh and Btw, whats your definition of the word killing?</div>

But this theory has been disproven by scientific studies as well as by the evidence that child abuse has sharply increased since abortion became legal.<br><br>In 1973, when abortion became legal in the United States, there were 167,000 cases of child abus and neglect reported. Yet in 1980 there were 785,100 cases - an increase of 370% from 1973. Furthermore, in 1987, there were 2,025,200 cases reported, which represents an increase of 1112%. (Source: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. National Center of Child Abuse and Neglect; National Analysis of Official Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting).<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Rather than helping stop child abuse, legal abortion has actually contributed to its sharp rise due to the effects abortion has had on women's self-esteem and the ability to deal with stress.</span> Dr. Philip Ney in a widely read study on the connection between abortion and child abuse notes:<br><br>"... elective abortion is an important cause of child abuse."<br>"Recent evidence indicates many women harbour strong guilt feelings long after their abortions. Guilt is one important cause of child battering and infanticide. Abortion lowers women's self-esteem and there are studies reporting a major loss of self-esteem in battering parents...."<br><br>Source: P. Ney, M.D. "Relationship between Abortion and Child Abuse." Canada Journal of Psychiatry, vol. 24, pp. 610-620.<br><br><strong>Damaged Families</strong><br><br>Researcher Emily Milling studied over 400 couples with women who had made a decision to have an abortion. Her research confirmed that 70% of their relationships ended within one month of the abortion. Sociologist Arthur Shostak found that three out of four male respondents had persistent day and night dreams about "the child that never was." And Linda Bird Franke has written "In my research, almost every relationship between single people broke up either before or after the abortion."<br><br><strong>Stress for Women</strong><br><br>Dr. Anne Speckhard, in a 1985 University of Minnesota study, researched "long-term manifestations of abortion" (5-10 years), and found that 81% of mothers reported preoccupation with their aborted child, 54% had nightmares, 35% had perceived visitations with their child, and 96% felt their abortion had taken a human life.<br><br><strong>Has Abortion Led to Infanticide?</strong><br><br>One of the arguments against legalized abortion around the time of Roe v. Wade was that it would lead to a slippery slope of euthanasia, infanticide, and other destruction of human life. It appears yesterday's naysayers were right.<br><br><strong>Statements about Roe v.
