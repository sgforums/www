Rather your friend don't have the child if he is not ready.<br><br>But think carefully hor, your friend may want to consider if he would want to attempt to take up the responsibility of being a father. Your friend may not be ready, but what done is done, so bo bian. Either make up mind that he is going to take responsibility (and be firm on this and not grumble later) or go for abortion.

YOu dont want this to be the last pregnancy she is going to have! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Please please please go see a proper doctor.  I know many of them at KK and they are very good there.  You need proper anaesthesia to undergo something like this.  go to the polyclinic and get a referral.  that would be the cheapest and the safest.<br><br>Please please dont play play. Already one new life is already being lost or threatened.  Dont anyhow play with the second one that still has many many years of living to go! abortion is not a routine thing its very damaging to the mother's womb.  who is going to be there for the girl??? the girl walks with psychological and mental anguish and the girl... that plus physical damage!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>get counselling then decide.  dont just think that abortion is the only way out.  there is adoption!<br><br>Most important of all, please dont play and dont just take the first suggestion that comes along that seems to relief the emotional and mental pressure... tha tis only an escape!  think this through and think about it again. its way too important to take it lightly and based the decision on cost or face or what have you.<br><br>take care</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>so how's the couple now?<br><br>abortion is not a merely a choice from the the involved party.... it also involve a life (the couple's own flesh and blood). To be actively be involved in ending that human life is very sad and tragic.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  Please consider longer before acting....<br><br>for more info can check out abortionfacts.com and also seek to know more from the doctors about abortion (quite a gruesome method of ending a life no matter the age of the foetus). Hope that the couple can give up the baby instead of abortion....</div>
