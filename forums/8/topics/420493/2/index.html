              <p>Depend la. Some police very afraid wan. But some dare to throw politicians out of the building. I last time read in the paper, got two teenager drive the family car without driver licence. But they stop at the road block, undercover police thot the teenager as drug dealer. So the police ask them to stop. But the teenager scared bcause they forgot to bring driver licence, so they sped the car instead.</p>
              <p>Then the undercover police give chase. Instead of fire at the tire, the crazy police go and shoot 20 over shots at the windscreen, killed one of the teenager driver. So the car crash into a wall but the other teenager manage to crawl out safely. After he crawl out safely, the undercover police some more go and whack and kick him. But somehow he manage to escape n run away.</p>
              <p>Next day, the mother of the dead teenager went to press conference n say her son onli crime is driving without driver license not a drug dealer.</p>
              <p>The case is stilln investigated under Royal Inquiry.</p>
              <p>See? Msian police also can do a lot of daring things. So be careful.</p>

              <p>Hp record? Where u going to put the handphone? In yer pocket? I try before but when I play the phone, onli static come out. If u hold yer handphone it is obvious ok.</p>
              <p>The worse case scenario is what if it is not the police but somebody posing as police?</p>
              <p>In Malaysia a lot of scammer posing as police ya know? They ask you for bribe then afterward for sexual favour, then you r in trouble.</p>
              <p>U sure yer law training can apply ah? Sg common law very different from Taiwan law leh. Taiwan law base on Chiang Kai Shek law. Sg and Msia law come from UK wan leh.</p>
