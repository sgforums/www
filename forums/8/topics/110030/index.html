Donation boxes will be placed at the venue, with proceeds going to the Red Cross.<br><br>The decision to cancel the fireworks display, part of an estimated $160,000 programme, was taken to "put into context the tragedy around us", said an Esplanade executive in a statement.<br><br>The fireworks will be "reserved" for a "more appropriate occasion" in future, the statement said.<br><br>When asked about the costs of modifying its programme, CEO Benson Puah said: "Surely everything that we do as a society cannot always be calculated in dollar terms. The right decision in this case is to cancel the fireworks. We need to rally as a people at this time and perhaps harp less on the costs of decisions made."<br><br>Similarly, the Downtown East Countdown Concert organised by the NTUC Club intends to observe a minute's silence at 10pm and has cancelled plans for a fireworks display.<br><br>The public can donate cash, clothing, food and the like at the event. All proceeds will be channelled to the Red Cross, and the Club will match dollar for dollar the cash donations collected. The total amount collected will be topped up to a minimum of $100,000 Â— regardless of the amount collected.<br><br>The Nation's Countdown party at Sentosa, jointly organised by MediaCorp TV and Sentosa, will proceed, and a one-minute silence will be observed at the event to mourn the victims.<br><br>However, as a mark of respect, MediaCorp TV will cancel its "live" telecast of the party on Channel 5.<br><br>Said Ms Selena Ho, vice-president of Networking Programming and Promotions: "As a national broadcaster, we are mindful of the sentiments of Singaporeans on this recent tsunami tragedy."<br><br>On the club scene, celebrations to usher in the New Year will proceed alongside initiatives to get support from its patrons for the victims.<br><br>Said Zouk's marketing manager Tracy Phillips: "We will be going ahead as planned (because) we have a lot of sponsors. It is a tragedy, but life has to go on. We are going to do our best to try and help."<br><br>Mr Michael Ma, 37, owner of the IndoChine bar and restaurant chain also plans to raise funds during IndoChine's celebrations. "We will continue to celebrate the New Year. We are very fortunate and we should celebrate this," he said.<br><br>While other grassroots celebrations will also carry on, one organiser, however, will turn its countdown party into a prayer session that will also be a collection drive for cash donations.<br><br>Northeast CDC, which shelved its countdown plans, will, instead, gather residents from Eunos and other parts of Singapore to show support for the tsunami victims. Religious leaders will be present for the prayer session, and the organiser hopes to raise at least $10,000 at the event, which will be held at Petal Gardens at Bedok Reservoir Road.<br><br>Said Northeast CDC Mayor Zainul Abidin Rasheed: "The timing is wrong for celebrations like that. It's our small way of showing our solidarity with our neighbours and all those who have died and their families who are suffering. And we thought that rather than celebrate the new year, which we can do anytime, we'll convert that countdown gathering into a show of support."<br><br>Regardless of what detractors may say, one Singaporean who is determined to usher in the New Year with friends at Indochine and Chjimes today, is undergraduate 22-year-old Sarah Teo.<br><br>"I refute accusations of callousness. I do care. I (participate) in relief efforts. But I reserve the right to usher in the new year with aplomb Â… even as aid supply goes on and we remember to rebuild from the tragedy."</div>

It is a serious event that has happened and they won't be disappointed but instead, take this time to think about the unfortunate and hopefully be able to provide and help out."<br><br>And the Downtown East party, which is expected to attract some 40,000 people, will be turned into a charity event.<br><br>The NTUC Club will match every dollar donated by the public.<br><br>It hopes to raise at least S$100,000 for the Red Cross.<br><br>Chng Hee Kok, CEO, NTUC Club, said, "To have the party continue without expressing outwardly a sign of support would not be quite right. The easiest thing to do for us, in getting so many thousands of people together, is to get some money from those who participate, so they understand the seriousness of the problem."<br><br>Preparations over at the Arts House have taken a back seat, as the area has been converted into a temporary collection centre, with hundreds of people making generous donations.<br><br>Mary Loh, Audience Development, Arts House, said, "Asia has changed irretrievably, and we felt we could not celebrate the countdown without some sense of compassion. We've done this out of respect and we believe all Singaporeans similarly would remember their countdown in the same way."<br><br>The Arts House, Esplanade and many other venues will not have pyrotechnics or fireworks.<br><br>The Clock of Victoria Memorial Hall will also chime, for the first time in 50 years, to help remember those lost in the tsunami. - CNA<br></div>
