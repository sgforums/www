            <div class='col-md body'>with so much discussions going on about it now.. what do our<br>students really think of the education system? According to the<br>minister, students in Korea and China work alot harder than us and<br>sleep less than us. Is this phenomenon only common among the asians? We dont see the australians, americans or anyone else working as hard, but they get more opportunities than us. Does our education system stifle creativity and make us afraid to fail?  While we're complaining of brain-drain, do we consider the causes of it?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was abt to start a thread abt changes in the education system every few years. Perhaps ppl have started discussions on this issue but I would like to add the following.<br><br>My batch was the batch when streaming into em1 started and other changes too place. I can no longer remember the other changes that took place over so many years. But that is besides the point. I heard that I am a year younger than a certain minister's daughter. Hence, whatever changes that take place in our edu system, will begin from my year so that his daughter will not belong to the guinea pig batch. Since young I have heard my parents tell me that I will always be the guinea pig batch.<br><br>Recently this "guinea pig batch" phrase rings in my head again. Apparantly, the change regarding Chinese language being not essential for University admission takes place in the batch where another/the same minister son is in. Again, this was what my aunt told me.<br><br>Of coz, i do not have concrete proof to what my elders tell me. But i juz feel what they say sounds very logical and justifies why these changes take place. Of cos, the government will state other reasons but could there be some other underlying reasons?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Anyway I feel that the edu system here is suitable only for the competitive and the capable. The various streamings and aiming to be tops among various schools have trained us to become wonderwomen and wondermen who sacrifice leisure time, sleep, or watever, juz to excel in our studies. Many students may slack and without putting effort in their studies, go downhill. The opposites will be students who piah like mad and study non stop so that they are kept well abreast of everything that goes on.<br><br>I frankly think it depends on the student whether to succumb to the tortures from various curriculums,various edu policies, various peer/self-pressure. I won't.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  A well-known advice among many would be to <strong>study smart and not hard</strong>.<br><br>Uni students here sometimes sleep only 2 to 4 hours only consecutively for weeks during semesters, and before any "A"/"O" levels, students sometimes burn midnite oil too... If Korean or Chinese students really sleep less than us, I really wonder how many hours they sleep...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

I am those that fail all the time but at crucial times, I will end up with surprising results, not too bad and not too good after studying a little bit. And I mean CRUCIAL times, not Final Examinations, I mean like O' Levels. The first time I really studied is during my Secondary School days, in Primary School time, I didn't even know what study means and I got straight As for PSLE.
