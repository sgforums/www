            <div class='col-md body'>yea.. i agree that the view was excellent!! I like the show because it really shows the selfishness of human nature. By wanting to keep the beach a secret, alot of problems were caused... Some parts were also very funny.. hehe.. especially Leo in that computer game thing.. hehe</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In the movie, what had started as a paradise finally came crashing down to Earth.  Do you think that the writer is saying there's no way we're going to have a paradise here on earth because human nature is such that one can't get along perfectly well with one another?<br><br>Even if Leo's character hadn't given out the map, trouble was indicated when Crystal was abandoned in the wood.  Also, the way I see it, if the people there had stay longer they would end up with a colony much like the one they had left back home, same old, same old.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I read the book last year and loved it. As such I'm a little apprehensive about watching the movie.

            <div class='col-md body'>Maya&gt; I liked the movie too! It turned out to be better than expected! see, its a leo dicaprio was in it and i was thinking it'll probably be another titanic BS of a movie... but NO i actually thought it was good. However, it did disturb me quite a bit. The very thought that pple would go all the way in the pursuit of fun... And yeah i did hear abt what happened when they were filiming and all the environmental issues raised, and that was disturbing too, because as much as i was in awe of the gorgeous setting, this little voice kept saying "yeah think about how many trees they had to kill just so you can contribute to Leo's paycheck..."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Liked the movie, though wasn't as good as I expected it to be. The pristine beaches were beautiful though they probably have gone through lots of landscaping! Ending was kinda ironical, how they all had to pack up &amp; leave after finding their perfect paradise! Guess Richard was like the catalyst that brought everyone back to the realities of life.<br>The shark attack of the two Swedes(??)was really disturbing....Maybe I'm too compassionate, but dumping the guy in the tent, &amp; not getting any help for him was too utterly inhumane.<br><br>Am told by friends who read the book that the bk was better. Is it true? I saw another book by the same author the other day. Can't remember the title, but I think it's set in the Philipines, abt some kids growing up in the slums(?) Anyone read that book?<br><br>P.S Think the soundtrack sounds pretty good.<br><br></div>
