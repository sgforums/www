What is wrong with being Chinese educated? What if its like say, French or German educated? Are they supposed to be inferior to English speaking people?<br><br>2. What is wrong with taking Neoprints and acting cute!? Okay, so its abit irritating at times, but, so what is so wrong about that?<br><br>3. What is wrong with Hokkien? KNN. I want also don't know how leh!!<br><br>4. What is wrong with Chinese medication? Alternative healings and medications are very popular in western cultures for quite some time, those include the "chinese meds" you mentioned.<br><br>5. What is wrong with Buddism!? Its catching on in western cultures too, do you know Faithless? He is a devout Buddhist too!<br><br>6. What is wrong in placing value into Chinese? Many people are rushing to learn mandarin and I have plans to study in China after my NS too! *although my mothertongue teacher would probably have a heart attack if she hears this*<br><br>7.

It's nt as simple as actin cute.. da problem's up ta a new level whn these ignorant lians type.. my gawd. look at their frenstas.. i'd give a link if ya not convinced.. There usin tht goddamn service as a mailbox.. see their testis N u'll die of a bloodclot in ya brain. cant friggin understand a word they're talkin.. N it's so damn act cute. Dont be surprised guys are also doin it.. I dont haf a prob wit neoprints but under my obseravtions.. most lians lurf ta use nps as their disp pics.. N whenevr i see some with cheena wordings esp or act cute bloated faces, I will definately nt click em.. for sure.<br><br>3. Hokkien is plain low class. period. let me convince ya.. Ya see..some bengs N lians haf forced me ta believe tht hokkien is a vulgar lang. More lyk a slang used ta scold pple..N it's unpleasing ta ya hears.. Even an 'ang mo' who has no prior knowledge ta hokkien knows 'ccb' is somethin tht's scoldin him.. Trust me.. i'm speakin frm experience.<br><br>4. Nah cheena meds are juz plain expensive N takes AGES ta work N damn smelly also.. it's All grass N more grass.. wtf? N most of da time ya needa fukin grind it yaself.. who's so free? i rather go see a western doc. Also some cheena docs R quacks N others con mans.. cheatin innocent pples' money.. go figure.<br><br>5. I respect it as a religion but in buddhism..pple burn stuff tht cause discomfort ta other pples' eyes.. N also paste those yellow stickers on doors. Ya noe wht?.. it often ends up as thrash cuz they fly bout whn wind blows.. it creates employment fer cleaners ya.. N also ocasionally ther chantin is extremely noisy.. rituals are worse.. ya'll understand. Christians aint so troublesome.. at least we're clean N at da same time worship a god juz lyk any other religion...<br><br>tbc<br><br></div>
