            <div class='col-md body'>If you define SPG as in the sort who goes clubbing to pull guys and seek attention, i do not look down on them but i feel sorry for them. Low self-esteem is usually the case. I don't encourage anyone to bring these people down.<br><br>However, inter-racial dating is so common these days, one in 10 girls in Singapore probably is dating someone off another race. I don't think these people should be looked down upon. Anyway, love is beyond age, skin colour, race, language. It would be just shallow to say that you only like white or latin men/women.<br><br>I believe everyone is entitled to their own opinion when it comes to the opposite sex. If anyone has a problem with their own race dating another race then all i can say is that the person is really shallow.<br><br>All men/women of any race are equal. The only reason why some singaporeans hold the mentality of white people as the "higher class" than asian people only reflects on our self-inferiority complex and low self esteem.<br><br>Please, no matter you're white, black, yellow, brown or whatever, can we just all live in peace? *sigh*</div>
