Okay. So its nothing wrong, its just that you don't like it.<br>7. I tried taking Japanese too, because it sounds kewl. Man. I almost failed.<br>8. Thats good for you, its your preference.<br><br>Do you know, Japan used to send scholars to China in the olden days to import their culture into Japan until the Tokugawa placed a ban on it? Most Japanese are Buddhist and/or Shinto-believers? The sushi that you find in most resturants in Singapore are shit? Japanese eats alot of rice, rice with rice and rice on top. Mandarin has always been the second most popular 2nd language aside from English in Japan, aside than their political conflicts, business still goes on as usual.<br><br>I think you know too little to really appreciate Japanese culture, as though with "western" culture. I don't even know if you appreciate the Brits, or Americans as English. Can you even tell the difference?</div>

It's easier for me ta socialise wif a caucasian thn a cheena kid cuz i dont haf anythin to talk with da cheena kid if he or she only noes cheena.. N dont forget they are extremely romantic too.. N creative.. tht's wht most sg guys are lackin.. N wht's it bout CHC? anythin wrong with it?.. as a christian myself i find it unjustifiable if pple comment unreasonably bout chrisitianity but of cuz in this case it hasn't happened yet. I dont wish ta haf pple condemnin it cuz i'm a christian..simple as tht. </div></blockquote>CHC does not represent the whole of the Christian kingdom, inter-religious conflicts in Christianity is a.. tradition passed down from ages before. As well as external critics.<br><br>Your adoration does not justify your distaste in another culture that behaves differently. That is called discrimination, and it is something that is unacceptable in the ideal western culture. And definitely not as a Christian and follower of the Word, to bring the Good News to gentiles like Chinese. And being a Christian, doesn't make you western, it makes you Eastern, like the Jews in Iraq, because Jesus was not speaking English and it is your responsibility to be like Him and bring people to Him disregarding of race, language and your personal preference. Simple as that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yea N no matter wht others say i still hafta say i apologize if i offended ya but it's juz my feelins N at least i didnt take tht ta a personal level N start pushin false accusations..<br><br>This is my stand N i'll stick ta it.. I'm labelled as SPG by quite a number of pple N thus i conclude tht most pple feel tht i'm one. As much as i hate labels.. it's somethin u cant get rid of N pple will still continue callin ya tht..aint it? I still do hate cheena as much cuz i see nothin good in it at all at this pt of time..seriously. maybe i'll change but who noes.. True tht i prefer caucasions ova our local sg guys fer three big simple reasons. They haf got.. Looks, Money N Charm.. three things most sg guys cant fulfil.. noe i'm bein materialistic here but it's wht attracts most women. Comon'.. look arnd ya. lotsa young girls are choosin caucasian bfs N why is tht so?..cuz there more favourable N richer, more handsome N noes how ta please women.. I swear tht i'll be more happy leading my life with a caucasian man rather thn a local guy cuz he can meet my needs.. N at da same time many of em lyk sg girls lyk us.. tht's why it's a win-win situation.. No regrets knowin em hotties cuz there good ta be arnd with.. i feel much more secure as they are bigger sized N well-built.. N has more financial backing.. tht's all i hafta say.. it's da reason why.. if ya eva see me clubbin.. i'm always wif my grp of frens who are together with some hot caucasian guys enjoyin ourselfs.. yeah! :]<br><br>bian</div>

Ya see..some bengs N lians haf forced me ta believe tht hokkien is a vulgar lang. More lyk a slang used ta scold pple..N it's unpleasing ta ya hears.. Even an 'ang mo' who has no prior knowledge ta hokkien knows 'ccb' is somethin tht's scoldin him.. Trust me.. i'm speakin frm experience.<br><br>4. Nah cheena meds are juz plain expensive N takes AGES ta work N damn smelly also.. it's All grass N more grass.. wtf?

I respect it as a religion but in buddhism..pple burn stuff tht cause discomfort ta other pples' eyes.. N also paste those yellow stickers on doors. Ya noe wht?.. it often ends up as thrash cuz they fly bout whn wind blows.. it creates employment fer cleaners ya.. N also ocasionally ther chantin is extremely noisy.. rituals are worse.. ya'll understand. Christians aint so troublesome.. at least we're clean N at da same time worship a god juz lyk any other religion...<br><br>tbc<br><br></div></blockquote>2) Like I said, itÂ’s just what defines them and their culture. Does it matter really? Does using a neoprint as their display picture cause that much trauma to you?<br><br>3) Hokkien is low-class? Now thatÂ’s stereotypical isnÂ’t it? Just because its part of ahbeng culture in Singapore to use Hokkien, does it mean Hokkien is low-class? What about the Chinese in China who use Hokkien, are they low-class too?<br><br>Hokkien is unpleasing? Unpleasing is subjective, techno is probably low class to you, I mean its part of ahbeng culture, so does that mean all Europeans are low-class too(weird, I thought you liked them?). Techno is apparently very very very popular there (itÂ’s not called euro-dance for a reason). CCB would be absolutely meaningless to someone who knows nothing about Hokkien. ItÂ’s probably the tone and body language that gave it away as a vulgar word, not the word itself.<br><br>So if IÂ’m getting you right, you think speaking English is really high-class? I dun think so, you're so too brainwashed by media and western culture to realize it I guess. You probably think the Japanese are high-class too, now thatÂ’s just plain stupid... Shesh..<br><br>4) Not all Chinese medicine is smelly, and not all western forms of medicine are tasty too. If western medicine is so heavily regularized and policed in Singapore, you think they will be no conman western doctors too?<br><br>5) Are you sure itÂ’s Buddhism thatÂ’s burns those stuff? Obviously you have a lot to learn. Most of the people burning that stuff are Taoist, not Buddhist.<br><br>You obviously have a lot to learn, my advice is to do some reflecting. I was exactly like you 2years ago. But now, IÂ’m more mature and accommodating of people and their culture.<br></div>
