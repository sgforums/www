If being a Chinese has its 'shortcomings' such as having jet black hair (I fail to see the shortcoming there), then I truly feel sorry for you. You only know how to see things on the surface and live your life for others instead of for yourself.<br><br>By the way, before you start counterflaming me, I just want to let you know that I'm not even Chinese at all... I'm Malay. This can be easily verified with some of the forummites here. I have an aversion to the pervasive hip-hop and rap culture of the Mats and Minahs, but I'm not going to diss them for it. They live life their way, and I live my life my way. It would do you some good to dump your sickening mentality that 'it's my way, or the highway'.<br><br>P.S. Lazerlordz.... the flamethrower fuel you passed me doesn't seem to work on this bugger... got any napalm?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From your posts, i have observed that your mindset has serious flaws. Firstly, the using of pejorative terms to describe your own race. The use of words to describe your own race, such as 'cheena', is equivalent to calling a person who has black skin colour a 'nigger'(purely an example, no offense intended). You might argue that making remarks such as 'i totally hate cheena stuff' and 'buddhism is crap' might not hurt, but it is such small things which sow the seeds of hatred and prejudice. You are only free if the men standing next to you are free. You will only preserve your rights if you respect the rights of others. As a chinese myself, i find it appalling that another chinese would look down on his or her own race, and instead seek the acceptance of other races which he/her find superior. Your arguments on why western men are better than Singapore men also have serious loopholes, with your assessment and comparison based solely on generalization and composition, serious fallacies in their own right. The justification of your premises, such as 'French is a high class language' are virtually non-existent. Is chinese not a beautiful language? Even though i take Japanese as my third language and also Russian as my fourth, does that make me more sophisticated and high-class than you, according to your warped theory? To me, chinese will always be the most marvellous language, regardless of how many other languages i learn, because it is my mother-tongue. If you just care to explore it, the fruits you will reap are boundless. For a person like you who hates chinese, i feel for you - for your loss.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, don't you people find this shallow? Which race is better or cooler, high society language, short skirts, big boobs and so on ...<br><br>Each race and culture is unique, the differences make it so interesting. I admit that living in own culture for years can make a person "bored" and wakes up the interest for other cultures. Everyone has his/her own preferences. But to "damn" own culture and race and "worship" some other culture or race, that doesn't have to be.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My honest opinion.  I can't be bothered if a girl likes go out with ang mohs exclusively.  Not my business to begin with.<br><br>But, I get seriously peeved when these girls start talking about their ang moh friends on how so much better, gentlemenly, richer they are than their Singaporean friends.<br><br>Sometimes, I just wanna tell them straight in the face, "thats cos they just want to get under panties."
