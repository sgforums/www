            <div class='col-md body'>Despite spending a few years overseas, I have never found any caucasian attractive simply cos of their looks.<br><br>Perhaps if you don't just see them in their dressed up, savvy style in pubs/restaurants/work/expat lifestyle, and see them instead in their home ground with stinking socks, stubbly faces, scruffy home clothes and messy.. MESSY rooms - they really lose a lot of the 'glamour' that SPGs associate them with. Not that I dislike them, many of them are nice enough - I just don't understand what's so special about them in GENERAL.<br><br>Everyone have their own tastes when it comes to the opposite sex. However, if you base you interest simply in superficial values, then well, you just have to handle the consequences of your own choice ba. I don't see why you need to seek affirmation from strangers here. I know lots of girls who simply prefers caucasians, and are realistic and unpretentious about it. They don't need to explain their choice to anyone and who cares what other people think. I think your insecurity stems from the fact that you are not truly comfortable with who you are.<br><br>And.. err.. actually what annoys me isn't your choice in men.. it's the way you can't seem to type normally. Personally, I find people who try to type cute on par with those who 'act cute' in neoprints.<br><br></div>

It is the mindset that you believe that only through a caucasian do you find life happiness, that is the problem. And you are very lack in general knowledge, about things that happen around you (Same as many God loving CHC people). Singlish would be "You stupid blur cok."<br><br>Now I see how the "She loves the white men, mainly Englishmen, Germans, French, Italians . That's the problem.." applies here.<br><br>The point that you define yourself hopeless, means that you identify this as a problem and thus if that is true, you are not as hopeless as you think you are. Of course, this may also mean as plain personal courtesy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by bout au revior:</div><div class="quote_body">naa i dont adore brits in general.. Only said i lurf caucasians fer their looks N class.. I find em classly N i their behavior desirable ta me.. It's easier for me ta socialise wif a caucasian thn a cheena kid cuz i dont haf anythin to talk with da cheena kid if he or she only noes cheena.. N dont forget they are extremely romantic too.. N creative.. tht's wht most sg guys are lackin.. N wht's it bout CHC? anythin wrong with it?.. as a christian myself i find it unjustifiable if pple comment unreasonably bout chrisitianity but of cuz in this case it hasn't happened yet. I dont wish ta haf pple condemnin it cuz i'm a christian..simple as tht. </div></blockquote>Seems like u cant get your mind out of caucasian guys. Let me educate u abt somethings u dont knw abt "ang mos". Firstly, ang mos can b realli gd friens to u, but nt suitable to work wif them 2gather. As for ur statement of caucasians r creative, i agree wif u, but e sad ting is they onli knw hw to talk big, give ppl rubbish ideas in which it cant b done. I'm saein tis cause i've work wif caucasians b4 in e advertising industry. Who doesnt knw hw 2 give ideas? but when you call them 2 hands on, they knw shit abt e software or aniting. N tats realli a disgrace to all e ang mos in european countries. Tink u must nt knwn tis bad ting abt ur ang mos... As for ur christianity issue, can i kindly ask if christians r allowed 2 dress sexily or visit clubs n get drunk. Frankly speakin, if u wan 2 b a Christian, b a gd 1 n make GOD proud, if nt dun even tell ppl u r 1, cause its realli a disgrace to GOD himself n fellow Christians. N again, jus believe in ur heart tat GOD exist, but dun tell ppl u r a christian, when e actions u do r otherwise.<br><br>Cheers gal!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>you are just a very confused and immature girl...<br><br>if you hate all things chinese (cheena as you put it), you are essentially hating yourself, your family and your roots...<br><br>if this holds truth, the following would happen in no particular order:<br>- you are ashamed of yourself (chinese)<br>- thinks the only way out of this 'low-class' cycle is by hooking up with a white<br>- after hooking comes marriage (US/Euro/Aus passport out of 'cheena' SG)<br>- produce a white offspring (cause a 'cheena' offspring would be shameful in your books)<br><br>like you say 'cheena' is low-class, then probably ang moh won't even consider you seriously. think about it, the really eligible ang mohs are in their homeland, why would they still need partners?!? (sexual partners maybe) most expats here are already engaged/married you would just be their short-term 'overseas attachment'.<br><br>"SG here i come; waste 'em, find another one." "China here i come; waste 'em, find another one." "Thailand here i come; waste 'em, find another one."... little did you realise that ang moh in SG are no different from SG men on overseas business attachment looking for social/sexual companions. this is understandable as men do get lonely especially in foreign land.<br><br>P.S.<br>Pretty sure you are a subscriber to 'Sex In The City', 'Desperate Housewives' and the upcoming 2006 release 'Desperate SPGs'.</div>
