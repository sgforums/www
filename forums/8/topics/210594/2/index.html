            <div class='col-md body'>1 teacher - Mrs Tan May Ling of Nanyang Primary Sch. DM and my form teacher cum maths teacher cum art teacher.  That was early 90s.<br><br>Pretty but overweight, act fierce, always picked on me.  I was a tomboy, liked to fidget - she didn't like it.  One time during a major test, I needed to check the answers but light too dim.  So I held up the test paper slightly.  If I recall correctly, I fidgeted quite a lot because it was hot.  Mrs Tan called me to the front and accused me of cheating.  She said she "caught me talking 3 times".  She marked a big "0" on my paper with a red pen, then asked me to stand in front of the entire class and do strange squatting tricks for her.  My finger was bleeding from an accidental cut while I was using a metal ruler for the test, and my sweat made it more painful.  I began crying and told her about the cut, but she refused to get me aid and said it "served me right".  It didn't help that I had finished my test early.<br><br>My mom confronted her and demanded an explanation.. The biatch said I was cheating.  So my mom had a look thru the paper and wallah, I would have gotten 100 marks for the test.. highest in class (and the only one too).  My mom was like "if my daughter were cheating, it means she didn't study.  If she didn't study, how could she get full marks??"  So the teacher give a super lan face and mark me 100.<br><br>From then on, she made sure my life was a living hell.. she made me stand outside class or in front of class for things like fidgeting, for looking at my eraser (that time, eraser with country flags on them were all the rage), for bending down to pick up stuff, forgetting to bring my pencil ... even once when I said, "Hey JunLi, Mrs Tan May Ling called you", she punished me and gave me demerit points.  Whatever excuse she could find.<br><br>She also gave me low marks for all my art pieces and never gave me encouragement though I was one of her brightest students.  Once, I did an art folio with a nicely coloured picture of a Warner Bros character.  It took me 8 hours to complete it and wrap it lovingly in plastic.  She accused me of taking someone else's work as my own and refused to accept it.  She gave me '0' for that assignment for "non-submission".  All my classmates said it was my fault, so I didn't dare tell my mom this time.  I later threw it away in shame.<br><br>From then on, I started passing up homework late coz I was paranoid.  She used that against me, saying it signified an "attitude problem".<br><br>_|_</div>

Mrs Tan May Ling (I think that's how u spell it).. traumatic sia.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  My mom remembers her too and refers to her as "that stupid teacher that dared to mark u '0' "  .. I can't remember if it was for the full year, but I remember classmates referring to her as "disclipline mistress".  It was in 1990, the year they intro-ed the GEP.<br><br>She had this very short wavy hair, very pretty in a fierce way but puipui one, bright red lipstick, seldom smiled, seemed as intelligent as Caroline Lee, liked to wear flowing 80s type blouses.  She left the school soon after, but I can't remember when.  The other guy she liked to pick on was called Wang Jun Li.  We always got punished together.<br><br>Not Stella Lee... She never touched me.  I didn't think she was half as threatening as Tan May Ling.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
