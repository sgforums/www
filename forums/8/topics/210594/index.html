            <div class='col-md body'>Lets see...<br><br>Secondary 2 Maths teacher, I stayed back for reccess and / or after school almost every single day of the year, because of copying work, corrections or forget to bring book. ...Suprising, although she acts like she is damn fierce in class, during those reccess / after school sessions, she is rather gentle. Hmm... weird. ( And if you are thinking weird, she treats all her students the same. )<br><br>Secondary 3 and 4, different Maths teacher, this one is really a shrew, your typical "tai tai" pattern, always bragging about her family, her new hairstyle, accessories, blah, blah...<br><br>She keep scolding, scolding and scolding me... for doing badly in Maths, never hand in homework, blah, blah... At least this one no need to stay back during reccess. But she eventually scared me into dropping A Maths ( More like I didn't wanted to be scolded by her anymore. ) Suprisingly, after I dropped A Maths she stopped scolding me, but she did made me promised infront of my class to get A1 for my Maths... but I got B3... I wonder if she's still upset with me.<br><br>Secondary 2 - 4 Chinese teacher, ok, this guy bites the cake. Hiss teaching is rather bad, no one really understands him. But thats not the problem, the problem is, my Chinese is rather bad too. And I failed it quite a lot. I mean WTF, I can't even read the questions.<br><br>So during the compilation of my Secondary 3 results, I got 49 for my Chinese. He mentioned infront of my class that some people don't deserve that 1 mark to pass, so he didn't give it to me. Well, I didn't need that 1 mark to proceed to Secondary 4, however, it did make me wonder if he would give me that 1 mark if I would have needed it to proceed to Secondary 4.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

But there was one time I was late for school, and I was stopped by the female DM.<br><br>I was already sweating (run to school) and was late by a few minutes not because I was lazy and overslept but rather a pipe in my house burst and my mom and I gotta stop the leakage first.<br><br>Female DM was unreasonable, saying things like burst pipes should call in ppl and not repair our own. Then I was telling her, "you have to understand, the house is only my mom and me, you can't expect my mom to do everything."<br><br>But because i was flustered by the running and panting, I just let that sentence out in a burst. The Male DM witnessed it and thought i was very rude to the teacher.<br><br>Then all hell broke loose, male DM asked my mom to come to see principal, then male DM "fed" nonsense to principal and even wrote a list of things I have done from Sec 1 to Sec 4....<br><br>I felt so betrayed that ppl I can confide into turn on me....<br></div>

But there was one time I was late for school, and I was stopped by the female DM.<br><br>I was already sweating (run to school) and was late by a few minutes not because I was lazy and overslept but rather a pipe in my house burst and my mom and I gotta stop the leakage first.<br><br>Female DM was unreasonable, saying things like burst pipes should call in ppl and not repair our own. Then I was telling her, "you have to understand, the house is only my mom and me, you can't expect my mom to do everything."<br><br>But because i was flustered by the running and panting, I just let that sentence out in a burst. The Male DM witnessed it and thought i was very rude to the teacher.<br><br>Then all hell broke loose, male DM asked my mom to come to see principal, then male DM "fed" nonsense to principal and even wrote a list of things I have done from Sec 1 to Sec 4....<br><br>I felt so betrayed that ppl I can confide into turn on me....<br></div></blockquote>I feel sad for you.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br>Maybe your male DM is eyeing for higher positions in the school..
