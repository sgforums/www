            <div class='col-md body'>As you all can guess...I'm very bored...<br><br>Just wondering what do most of you think of the computer/video RPGs in the market these days.<br><br>I can consider myself growing up on RPGs, back to the days of the good old pen and paper Dungeon and Dragons to computer RPGs like Might and Magic, The Bard's Tale, Ultima, Wizardry etc etc.<br><br>I've tried out the "new generation" of RPGs like Diablo, Final Fantasy VII, Balder's Gate etc etc, but somehow I just have this feeling that they do not make RPGs like they used to. In fact I would only consider Balder's Gate a true RPG, though the former two are classified as such (I'd say they are more like Arcade and Adventure respectively). Worst still were the updated versions of the old series, who come across as games who are trying to capture the new market, yet trying to retain their traditions. Unfortunately they fell flat on their faces on both accounts. In fact, you can say they are the worst of both worlds.<br><br>Perhaps its just me who's not accepting the change to my beloved computer gaming genre; or it could be just that the new RPGs are unable to reproduce the same magic that enchanted "old gamers" like us. Either way, I've already moved on in life away from RPGs onto other things. But I do keep track on what's going on from time to time    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Well...just thinking out loud.<br><br>------------------<br>I do not embrace my dark side, but I do acknowledge it;<br>else I can never be whole<br><br>[This message has been edited by Bravehart (edited 16 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think it is that bad..........I think FF is still more or less RPG, though I have to agree that there is definitely more adventure than older time RPGs. Still, I think the newer RPGs like Wild Arms are still along the lines of true RPG and are definitely great to play!<br><br>Then again, I do agree that there is getting lesser and lesser true RPG games coming up. IT seems that most people nowadays prefer strategy or adventure. How about a vote? Those who still prefer RPG can voice out, together with some recommendations on what you think are great true-blue RPGs!!<br></div>

For those sega siao, there's Phantasy Star! Another all time classic! And there's Warsong, which have migrate to several machine liao!<br><br>My favourite is still DragonQuest. For true RPG, stay with TV games like PS and DC. Computer lose out to TV games in themes of grahpics and storylines.

            <div class='col-md body'>Talking about RPGs, nothing still quite beats the paper based AD&amp;D game. Modern PC RPGs are more into levelling up, wonderful graphics, a so so story line and more usually, a lame ending which leaves u wondering why you waste so many weeks to complete it only to get a short and usually lame ending.<br><br>Perhaps the only game with a ending worth playing for was FF8.<br><br>One of the irritating traits of RPGs on game consoles such as FF series, Shining force series, DQ, etc, etc.. is the levelling, U walk around in circles trying to get monsters... raise ur level, kill the boss and advance to the next "stage" of the story.. most pple do not really sit down and follow the storyline carefully crafted by the creators of the game.<br><br>Juz some thoughts of mine.<br><br>------------------<br>Why?

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh yes... and talking about Warsong, also known as Langrisser(Jap title) I wouldn't really consider it an RPG, more like a strategy game.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, I thought RPGs are about walking about and leveling up? I remember playing games like Phantasy Star, or warsong, and having to delay my progress just to level up. The time spent was worth it when I crushed the bosses easily in the next stage........Though to some, the time was wasted, to me, it did not divert me from the storyline at all.......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ey shit braveheart...finally someone who likes RPG....I thot I was the onli guy in Singapore man...!!!!!:-)<br><br>I also grew up on RPG...right from the time of the early IBMs the Miorrow computers, Tandy computers from Radio  shack.....playing all those text based computer games...I dun even remember he names of them it's been so long...<br><br>Also played Dungeons and Dragon with dice and paper and everything man...soooo coool...nothing compares to it...<br><br>And I can't believe anyone here even knows what the hell Bards Tale was....That game was so calssic...kekeke...<br><br>Anyway I am also appalled by the new games coming out now a days...I know that most people buy these games, but I really dun't like them...All these 3D games and first person walk thrus.....<br><br>ey have you ever played WasteLand?...Absolutely the best RPG game you will ever come across before or now...It's a post Holocaust RPG...Superb game....<br><br>Now a days When I go and look for games I feel so bored...But luckily now and then they do produce very good RPGs....<br><br>case in pioint is Fallout and Fallout 2....This game is superb...When I played it it remeinded me so much of those old RPG...the design of hte graphics and everything including the music is even very 50's retro and I feel so reminiscent playing it....Try it...yoiu sure won't be dissappointed...<br><br>The story is great and doesn't over do it with overly long story lines within story lines...like torment which is made by the same company as Fallout and Fallout 2...except that they tried too hard to make it like those old RPGs....the graphics is good and is like other good RPG by showing the birds eye view(isometric) of the game play...but then it overdoes the gasme with too much text and lengthy and complex storyline...There are so many characters to interact with and each one  talk to has a fucking long substory for you....fucking bullshit because I spent 3 full days plaing it and I barely moved more than a few screens from where I originaly started because the text was so lengthy...basically it lost me and I was bored of it because I wante dto play the game and not read the whole damn thesaurus...no fun.<br><br>I also miss the old Ultimas before ultima 8....I think that the newer one is a 3d version rite?...sad...<br><br>But try Fallout and fallout 2....These two games were so famous and is a cult classic now among the true RPG people like us...It sold out like hotcakes and it was very hard to find anywhere...even now you can only find a few copies around SimLim......<br><br>This goes to show that many people would rather play games that are true to the RPG style...since then I have tried to find games like these but the only game coming close is Warhammer 10,000 AD.....very slow game to play tho...but if you have patience then it's fantastic...but it's a strategy though...<br><br>Another game off point is the strategy game: X-com....bnot the flight simulator, but the strategy ones....fantastic game...another cult classic...to me anyway...<br><br>GREAT TO KNOW ANOTHER RPG-er<br><br>RPG ON MAN!!!</div>

The only one I played was Fianl Fantasy VII, and I had to admit it was excellent!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>To firewire and eck:<br><br>Believe me man...I'm as surprised as you to find another RPG gamer here  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I thought people like us had become extinct already!<br><br>I really missed the days of the old pen and paper. At its best, I think it beat watching a movie anytime  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Feeling nostalgic now...suddenly remembered my Fighter whom I saw through from level 1 up to immortality...*sob* *sob*<br><br>Of course I remember Bard's Tale and Wasteland  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> They were the best RPGs for the PC at that time! In fact Wasteland borrowed the combat engine from Bard's Tale and become inspiration for the development of the Fallout series! I've played Fallout but not Fallout 2, mabe I'll pick it up someday  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Haha! In fact, I can still get the old games and distribute it around; just for memory's sake!<br><br>If you want to experience the "feel" of the old RPGs, Baldur's Gate is the closest you'll get...and if an old timer like me can rave about it, trust me..its worth getting  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>For me I'll always have a soft spot for the Ultima series, been a fan of it since Ultima 4, which was followed by the excellent (but not well known) Worlds of Adventures and the Ultima Underworld escapades. And you are right..Ultima 8 sucked big time; I think we can attribute it to poor marketing timing and over-ambitious design. But the games before U8 were really true to their RPG roots (re: totally non-linear)!<br><br>But I would recommend Ultima 9 a try, after all it is the end of the Trilogies of Trilogies. Its also marked the first time I saw Britannia in 3D; first time I saw a 3D Shrine; first time I saw a 3D Lord British; first time I saw a 3D Avatar; first time I ever experienced motion sickness <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> (and I am a Quake-type player).<br><br>Perhaps RPGs should have remained how they had always been--text based. After all, reading something like "The muddish coloured troll raised his blood stained axe and bellowed a war cry before charging at your party" has more impact on the imagination than seeing a pathetically rendered 3D "Troll" on screen gliding towards you in a comical way. Our technolgy has certainly improved...but it still cannot replace our imaginations.<br><br>Guess this is one of the reasons why RPGs have lost their magic touch on the gamers.<br><br>And as you said...<br><br>RPG ON MAN!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>I do not embrace my dark side, but I do acknowledge it;<br>else I can never be whole</div>

I have a group of players that are still sorta hunting for paper and pencil players.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Hey, you know, I played most of the stuff you guys mentioned, from AD&amp;D, "Bards Tale", to Phantasy Star 2 when I was in Primary school, to PC AD&amp;D, Shining Force, and even indulged in Ravenloft for a while in Secondary School, and eventually MUDing.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Gods, those days, when we would compare how much more powderful our characters are. (Oh... my level 16 Mage..... Sigh.... maybe I can STILL dig up that character sheet.....) Indulging in the character cards.... reading those Player's handbooks..... *Goes into nolstagia mode*<br><br>For interests sake, those of you who STILL wants PC RPGs of the old, I have a link, but you have to sorta hunt for the games.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> The Console ones, there are emulators and ROMs, but I believe most of you know where to get those.<br><br>Try :<br><a href="http://ring.gamingdepot.com" rel="nofollow">http://ring.gamingdepot.com</a><br><br>Old time games are still the best, IMO, since, right now, games are getting much too flashy, with little thought to storyline.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>"A Gentleman is not an implement."<br>-Confucius, Analects, 2:12</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>like many of us here, i grew up in the AD&amp;D world too, adventuring mainly in the Realms. A bit of Krynn but mostly in the Realms.<br><br>true...nothing quite beats paper and dice. d20, d100, etc. though i haven't played a proper paper RPG in 5 years.<br><br>Computer RPG??? well...i admit that Baldur's Gate is the best of the lot though it has certain things which i find unbelievable. How could you ever kill Drizzt Do'urden??? You're so damn weak compared to him, the greatest weapon master in the Realms!!!!!<br><br>The FF series brings a refreshing change to the conventional RPG aspect. Some might not like it, but I think FF8 is quite cool....<br><br>The old Ultima series was great...reminds me of the days i had a 286. Ultima 9 : Ascension is excellent and being the last Ultima, is quite worth getting. true...some might not be used to the 3D stuff, but hey...it's called progess.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>just wondering...<br><br>everyone's sharing about all the great RPGs and all... how come no one has mentioned *ahem* Chrono Trigger yet?<br><br>That game was, IMHO, THE rpg.. it had great gameplay, immersive storyline, wonderfully developed characters (who could forget Magus??? or Frog???), and most of all great pacing (something most RPGs these days tend to overlook)<br><br>waiting in eager anticipation for the CT sequel, Chrono Cross... heard it's even better than FF8<br><br>oh, personally, FF6 (or FF3 in the USA) comes in a close 2nd. Opera scene... *drool<br><br>and as for FF7 and 8, haven't really completed them.. i felt the pacing on these 2 was rather draggy... esp. FF8, where you could tune back to TV and watch adverts. and trailers while the GF animation runs. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> but i am hoping to start play FF8 again, heard that the storyline is worth playing till the end for.<br><br>auf weidersein for now</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From the looks of the posts here, seems the theory that RPG players from either consoles (PC or game machines) do not crossover to each other still holds  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Looks like somethings never change. Hahaha!<br><br>But I have to agree that nothing (and I mean NOTHING) can beat the experience of the pen and paper RPGs. I think those of us who had played it appreciates it a lot, its just that time constraints of modern life does not permit much indulgement in them anymore. That's why I did jump to CCGs for a while   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>The following post is quite long..pls bear with me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Rulakir:<br><br>Yeah, I used to own the Robotech books, but I sold it to a fren because I did not have any use for it and needed cash for something else at that time! Should have kept them, had very nice diagrams of the Mechas...Still have the Battletech ones though! Would love to join in with you friends, but physical distance from my place of study to Singapore would make it quite impossible for me to be a regular at your sessions.<br><br>Araina:<br><br>Boy~ you never cease to amaze me. Think I saw you in the thread on Heavy Metal and now I see you in one on RPGs. Pretty unconventional for a gal   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Anyway, back to the original point - I am knocking down the new RPGs because I HAVE tried them, and they do not measure up to my expectations of an RPG. Of course everyone has different expectations of an RPG..so just dig what you like!<br><br>Altrex:<br><br>Cool~ In terms of gaming I think the Realms is definately the place! But in terms of story and setting, the Dragonlance saga (5th Age notwithstanding) is simply the best! The best piece of fantasy literature since JRR Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings".<br><br>As far as Ultima is concerned, I was quite disappointed to find that Britannia was hit by a cataclysm and the landscape has now changed beyond recognition! No doubt it was intentional so that the game could run on a decently-configured PC, but I was disappointed nonetheless. What would I have given to walk on a 3D Britannia in its original glory (around the U7 era).<br><br>------------------<br>I do not embrace my dark side, but I do acknowledge it;<br>else I can never be whole<br><br>[This message has been edited by Bravehart (edited 19 January 2000).]</div>
