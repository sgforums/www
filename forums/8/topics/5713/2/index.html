I'm mudding on Solan ( Check it out - <a href="http://www.solan.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.solan.org/</a>  ). Its really cool in here and the people are friendly. Been spending so much time i've logged 4 characters and spent like over 500hours on it since June hols in 1999.<br><br>Any other mudders around? Anyone like to take a look around on solan?

Firewire, Braveheart etc..<br><br>I am definitely from the age of Ad&amp;d, and even when Magic came along, I didn't stray far from Ad&amp;D.. Bards Tale? haha.. cool man, brings back memories. Ultima I, Champions of Krynn and all the old classics  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I'm quite a die hard fan of TSR (Ad&amp;d only) actually, and dun follow much of anything else. Heck I'm still into designing characters and writing fantasy stories!! Don't play much but would like to get back with my group and DM them again...<br><br>Fantasy rulez!! RPGs rock!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Cheers to all the Ad&amp;d dudez...

            <div class='col-md body'>I started of playing Robotech when I was in Primary 4. That's like long long time ago. Back then it was pure storytelling, no dice, no paper, and it was GREAT!<br><br>I have tried AD&amp;D, nice, but in my opinion, way to hack and slash for me, not to mention the rule lawyers.<br><br>Can't forget Battletech, the only game which I spent loads of dollars getting the Technical Readouts, novels, a few other source books, board games and lead minatures. Used to be able to remember all the 'Mechs and their weapons from 2750 till 3050. ;D<br><br>Now I've shifted to the World of Darkness by White-Wolf. And I LOVE it! Although mostly playing Vampire, haven't tried the others like Mage, Werewolf, Changeling and Wraith.<br><br>Computer RPGs are fun, but I prefer the feeling when you get together with friends and play it the old fashioned way.<br><br>Just wondering, any female RPG players?<br>Happy Gaming people.<br><br>Just my two cents worth.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hiya!<br><br>I know this thread is kinda exhausted but I'll chip in nonetheless...<br><br>I've been a committed RPG addict since D&amp;D... back when evagelists in the States were up in arms about Satanic influences and wot not, and the church in Singapore subsequently kicked up a furore. A 20-sided die looked so wondrous then :&gt;<br><br>To reassure old-timers, Bard's Tale and Wasteland was the absolute best! Wizardry was so-so esp when it was up against Ultima II. Yes *laugh* I'm that old :&lt; Anyway, I bought Bards Tale III : Thief of Fate in it's original box and I intend to keep it for souvenir's sake. Remember Legend of Ys? or even Phantasy?<br><br>Moving on however, I switched over to console RPGs and was hooked...<br><br>Bravehart, I guess you are right in saying that RPG has "changed" and you didn't like the new directions and prefered the purity of somthing like Baldur's Gate (BG II is TBR, so I wonder if you are holding ur breath). However, however close the game approaches an approximation of the paper/pen RPG concept, it does not necessarily make it a great game. Therein lies the difference.<br><br>FFVII must be one of the worst at trying to pass itself off as an RPG, but it was a GREAT GAME! The pacing was superb ; the characters engrossing ; the conception of the gameworld endearing and most importantly, told a story. As someone else already rightly pointed out, RPG is not abt leveling up. If you need to spend an extra 10 hrs levelling up to continue with the story, the game designers may have failed that little bit in catching you up in the progressive narrative.<br><br>The console era was great stuff as many would agree... and I guess I would think as a purist if I had stuck only to PC... so to all those who have a serious interest in RPGing their way into failing every exam  :p, I'll sincerely recommend these old-skool titles to try. Most can be downloaded for free so do give them time to grow with you ...<br><br>And the console nominees are ... *drum roll*<br><br>1) Legend of Zelda - Link to the Past<br>2) Legend of Zelda - Ocarina of Time<br>3) Suikoden I &amp; II<br>4) Chrono Trigger<br>5) FF (I dig the whole series, having played from 4 till 8 but if you dun have time, the essential old-skool stuff will be 5 &amp; 6)<br>6) Grandia<br>7) Thousand Arms<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Dragonquest (any you can get ur hands on!)<br>9) Lunar<br>10) Star Ocean<br><br>PS&gt; Most of these have a PSX port, and since it's the most popular format nowadays, I think it's a pretty safe bet that you get it it at the nearest ... um... copyroght-challanged stall.<br><br>PPS&gt; Miss my SNES system.  :p<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Heh heh well it is interesting to see that most pple play console RPGs over anything else... I fear the old pencil and paper RPGs are perhaps dying a slow death.<br><br>It would be hard to consider console RPGs true RPGs as the only character development you get is from levelling up.... In console RPGs the only way for your level 1 character to kill a say.... dragon would be unless you 1) cheated or 2)it was event driven, meaning it WAS supposed to happen<br><br>However in pen &amp; paper RPG, a level 1 character(or a group) would be able to kill a high level monster. Not by direct combat but perhaps by conceiving some feasible idea(i.e. luring the monster into a trap).<br><br>Therein lies the magic of pen and paper RPG, coz you are not bounded by a preprogrammed environment(unless ur DM sucks that is) You choose how your character develops and how u choose to interact with your group member and NPCs. Almost anything is possible in pen and paper RPG(again depending on ur DM) where your imagination is the limit!<br><br>------------------<br>Why? Why me?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>both are difficult coz in those lonewolf or what some of my frens say... the jumpjump stories one. reminds me of the old program method kinda like this pts to that pt to another thing. its all ifs else else then etcetc.<br><br>if the author doesnt gets to think of that possibility then suay suay ur story/game will get boring.<br><br>nothing is more unexpected than fate and even if u play a game, be it book or gam set, u cant just goto and shop which is not written by the author or programmed by the programer, but in real life, u can go and get some whore for all other ppl care.<br><br>so whether its books or game sets<br>the fate set by the author or programmer has binded u tightly and leave u no freedom to do what u wanna do.<br><br>so not much comparison on both la<br>i like both still.<br><br>there was this time when i went to use Qbasic to program D&amp;D<br>managed halfway onli... sad....<br><br>------------------<br>Class.forName("sun.jdbc.odbs.JdbcOdbcDriver");</div>
