In other words is that she does not reject the possibility of u being her bf....it is also shown when she initiaites contact and does not mind going out with 1 on 1 dates. she is comfortable with u lah,.....as for the part where she is not very vocal...she is probably dunno what to say ( cant think of what to say) or since her breakup was recent, she could be afraid that u would leave her and not be her friend or something.<br><br>that's my 2 cents worth.....</div>
