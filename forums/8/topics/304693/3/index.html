            <div class='col-md body'>In my school, if a student or even teacher wants to enter a room with another teacher inside, you have to knock and wait for the teacher to give you permission to come in.<br><br>It is a trivial matter yes, but if it is not prevented, people would start walking in and out the room without any control. You can see like this, the classroom is like the teacher's house during lesson time. As long as he is still inside, no matter whether the class is dismissed or not, it is still his house. And you don't enter someone's house without that person's permission. It is as simple as that.<br><br>Yes, the teacher shouldn't have flared up but really, it can be very trying sometimes. I have had a student challenging me recently and I had to really bite my tongue to prevent myself from going down to his level. I think the appropriate thing to do is for the student to apologize to the teacher first (as he started the whole trouble by entering the classroom without the teacher's permission) and if the teacher does reflect on his action, he would apologize to the student's after that.<br><br>That would be something I would do <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

The next time, your reply should be, "If you are so god damn capable, you wouldn't be here, but you should be out in the private sector!!!"<br><br></div></blockquote>Yes, and since teaching have a high pay, they join the teaching force, I realise that expirenced teacher have their way of getting respect, some of the new teachers too, but somehow people are not able to control anger so properly.<br><br>If a teacher is fighting with the student, would the student be in a wrong too? as teacher are civil servant, and harming them is wrong.</div>

Perhaps after a few days, both parties will forget about the whole incident.<br>2) If problem still persist. Wait till both parties have cooled down then have a chat with that teacher in the presence of a mediator - your school counsellor perhaps.<br>3) Be humble. See that it was also your fault that you walked into the class without asking for permission.<br>4) True. That teacher is also at fault for shouting and barking, and perhaps making a mountain out of a mole hill. Well, teachers are not saint.
