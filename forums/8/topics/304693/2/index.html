So from my point of view, so for his own first piority, he is not exercising care for others.<br><br>From the other thread i can see that there are many bad tempered teachers around. </div></blockquote>The lesson ended and students going out does not mean it is polite to just walk in without a permission/acknowledgement of teacher's presence.<br><br>At the same time, yes I agree that the teacher should apologise and handle this matter in a more suitable way.<br><br>However, the student made the first mistake, so he should apologise first. He is only apologising for HIS mistake, not the teacher's. And regardless of how wrong the teacher was, does not justify him making the mistake to begin with. Just because someone else is at fault, does not mean that you are not too. In fact this has nothing to do with teacher/student.<br><br>But rather by taking responsibility for your own mistake, you empower yourself by doing the RIGHT thing. You don't become RIGHT by pointing fingers at someone else's WRONGS. It's not up to you to 'teach' someone else a lesson, just learn your own lessons well.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>first and foremost, your story itself is already biased against the teacher isn't it? from the way you wrote the story it just seem like the teacher was completely in the wrong.<br><br>true both are in the wrong. teacher for flaring up, student for being rude. honestly after being repriminded and just leaving without a word is damn rude.<br><br>imagine you're thinking of something important halfway than your <strong>younger</strong> just come into the room and disrupted your chain of thoughts so you shouted at him "GET OUT!" he just ignored you, gave you tt lj face and left the room without saying a word. how you feel? don't tell me you won't wanna pick a fight with him? especially when you're in a bad mood?<br><br>of course as a student we wouldn't think of writing it to the papers and all. probaly just settle everything on the spot. won't think so far at that point of time. i won't blame the student for reacting this way because i probaly would too if i were to be at the scene. but if this matter persists and the teacher picks on others, i feel tt its high time you people should do something about it.</div>
