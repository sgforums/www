I know there are plenty of schools which do that but I just want to compare it against the situation in my school.<br><br>Just some background info, our school has started conserving paper since last year and students have to pay for their worksheets. This caused some teachers teaching sec 4 classes last year to think twice before printing any notes for their students, who are sitting for their O levels within a few months time.<br><br>The beginning of this year, my form teacher told us that the prinicpal decides that paper is too cheap, they shall conserve INK instead.<br><br>Of course, both students and teachers are rather irritated by this news. Teachers have been buying their own papers for printing of worksheets and study notes since last year, and now they school is monitoring the use of ink as well. Teachers have to login to their account before they are able to use the printer. This also means students have to pay for both the paper and the ink.<br><br>However, the weird thing is that my school is always talking about reducing costs. Right now, there are 3 ponds in my school compound, supposedly for decoration purposes, one of them for religious purposes. The 4th one is being built right now. Isn't this a waste of money?<br><br>Second evidence is the large number of rocks along the school's driveway and carpark. Guess what, the rocks have our school song's lyrics printed on it. And decorations of the carpark using huge colourful balls looked ridiculous.<br><br>I feel that this is going too much. The school kept encouraging us to donate to the school but I find money being spent on useless objects. Its true we need a nice environment to study, but the school is beautiful enough without those rocks and the 4th pond (located outside chemistry labs, exploding fishes anyone? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ).<br><br>Many students in my school object to the excess spending of money on decorations as well. Anyone facing similar situations in school? Care to discuss? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>for my sec sch, the new principal save energy by cutting electricity and water. so, no lights in most toilets, the most 1 light on for each. some taps no water. at night camp, cant even on the corridor lights as the main switch is off. zzz</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It was such an ironic observation. When ppl predict computer to be used widely, using of papers should be lesser and hence kill fewer trees. In reality, it is just the opposite. With more information to be seen from computer, ppl print even more cuz they just cannot get used to seeing it on screen.<br><br>So in a way, invention of computers caused the trees to die faster.

            <div class='col-md body'>IMO you definitely have a case against the fund management practices of your school and its cost cutting measures.  It's wrong for the school to pass down essential learning costs to its staff and students, like printing of worksheets, while building extravagant decorative structures.<br><br>Bad fund management is a possible risk because some schools are more autonomous and independent than others and the board is given more control.  Policies are then decided by the school board and principal.<br><br>I don't see much repurcussion if you spoke up about this because your immediate teachers are feeling the brunt of bad policies too.<br><br>However there are other groups you can approach to represent your case.  Your school student council, if they are daring enough.  Or your alumni, if they are concerned enough.  Or your school's parent support group.  They should be well-aware of the additional costs they are paying for their child's education.  Or you could just get a parent to bring up this issue to the school or to the papers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Heres the latest updates<br><br>One of my teachers revealed that ALL the 4 ponds are sponsored, some by the school's alumni. Why would they sponsor so many ponds? I have no idea. The 4 ponds are EXCLUDING the primary school section, where there are more. I have not found out whether the rocks are sponsored though.<br><br>MOE has reduced the funding to all schools, thus resulting in many schools cutting costs.<br><br>They seemed to be continuing the Tablet PC Programme, which is sensible since we have already spent tons of money on building the infrastructure. (Eg. Equipping every class with wireless routers)<br><br>Heres something new. Certain teachers have been forced to work harder, with one teacher being told by the HOD to come up with 10 test papers within a week. These tests are meant to test the students weekly, for 10 weeks.<br><br>So lets say I gonna make a petition, I'll only have the following effective factors in order of importance<br><br><ul>Clubs and Societies treated as lower-class CCAs<br>Teachers overworked<br>Failure/Lack of planning of Tablet PC Programme<br>Saving paper is reasonable. Saving INK is NOT!</ul><br><br>Anything else? I don't wanna make a petition unless I find out the truth and have enough evidence to support my points... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
