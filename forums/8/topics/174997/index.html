            <div class='col-md body'>Hey guys, I wanna know which school (Secondary level) besides mine are currently conserving utilities and saving money. I know there are plenty of schools which do that but I just want to compare it against the situation in my school.<br><br>Just some background info, our school has started conserving paper since last year and students have to pay for their worksheets. This caused some teachers teaching sec 4 classes last year to think twice before printing any notes for their students, who are sitting for their O levels within a few months time.<br><br>The beginning of this year, my form teacher told us that the prinicpal decides that paper is too cheap, they shall conserve INK instead.<br><br>Of course, both students and teachers are rather irritated by this news. Teachers have been buying their own papers for printing of worksheets and study notes since last year, and now they school is monitoring the use of ink as well. Teachers have to login to their account before they are able to use the printer. This also means students have to pay for both the paper and the ink.<br><br>However, the weird thing is that my school is always talking about reducing costs. Right now, there are 3 ponds in my school compound, supposedly for decoration purposes, one of them for religious purposes. The 4th one is being built right now. Isn't this a waste of money?<br><br>Second evidence is the large number of rocks along the school's driveway and carpark. Guess what, the rocks have our school song's lyrics printed on it. And decorations of the carpark using huge colourful balls looked ridiculous.<br><br>I feel that this is going too much. The school kept encouraging us to donate to the school but I find money being spent on useless objects. Its true we need a nice environment to study, but the school is beautiful enough without those rocks and the 4th pond (located outside chemistry labs, exploding fishes anyone? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ).<br><br>Many students in my school object to the excess spending of money on decorations as well. Anyone facing similar situations in school? Care to discuss? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This reminds me of my secondary school last time..<br><br>My school is having a Grand Opening Ceremony and got guest of honour from MOE.<br><br>The ceremony was in July but the year before she already panicked for funding liao.<br><br>Her genius solution is, extraordinary budget request (equipment purchase) for ECAs (then called) are all rejected. Selected educational teaching aids are approved, those the school have already will be shared.<br><br>ECAs with little enrollment are shut down, similar ECAs are merged. To her, Volleyball AND netball are similar!!! Chinese/Malay Drama club merge to become Drama Club. Chinese and modern dance merged.<br><br>This made ALOT of teachers unhappy.<br><br>And the "saved" funds are used to repaint the school (school was 2 years already), she hired contractors to decorate the school for the ceremony, she hired professional photographers and videographers instead of using students/<br><br>Alot of teachers became so pissed that they aired their unhappiness to us students.<br><br>They say, why can't use student effort to decorate the school and more creative ideas will come out. Using professional photographers and videographers are an insult to the student ones who themselves are quite established by winning few competitions.<br><br>In the end, the principal was unhappy with the contractor decor that she last minute asked teachers and student to stay evenings to redo the place.<br><br>Best part, the ceremony is only 3 hours!!!<br><br>Better part, she got her promotion the year after.<br></div>

And the great thing is, the tablet PC programme lasts for a year only. Now they scrapped it off I think, due to high costs. So much for installing wireless routers for all sec 3 classrooms and commonly used areas like hall, lecture theatre and auditorium.<br><br>Really? I didn't know he is comparing ponds with china schools. Well, one of the pond is sponsored, but the decorations of that pond is NOT. My tennis player friends say the tennis is out of shape. Its too long. Rock wall is used by sec 3 and 4 students for their PE lessons last year. But this year haven use it at all...<br><br>Yup, ang-pow, donate to school. I only donate 2 bucks at most. They even gave us 2 ang-pows, one for the student, one for the student's PARENTS to donate to the school<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Ponders:</div><div class="quote_body">This reminds me of my secondary school last time..<br><br>My school is having a Grand Opening Ceremony and got guest of honour from MOE.<br><br>The ceremony was in July but the year before she already panicked for funding liao.<br><br>Her genius solution is, extraordinary budget request (equipment purchase) for ECAs (then called) are all rejected. Selected educational teaching aids are approved, those the school have already will be shared.<br><br>ECAs with little enrollment are shut down, similar ECAs are merged. To her, Volleyball AND netball are similar!!! Chinese/Malay Drama club merge to become Drama Club. Chinese and modern dance merged.<br><br>This made ALOT of teachers unhappy.<br><br>And the "saved" funds are used to repaint the school (school was 2 years already), she hired contractors to decorate the school for the ceremony, she hired professional photographers and videographers instead of using students/<br><br>Alot of teachers became so pissed that they aired their unhappiness to us students.<br><br>They say, why can't use student effort to decorate the school and more creative ideas will come out. Using professional photographers and videographers are an insult to the student ones who themselves are quite established by winning few competitions.<br><br>In the end, the principal was unhappy with the contractor decor that she last minute asked teachers and student to stay evenings to redo the place.<br><br>Best part, the ceremony is only 3 hours!!!<br><br>Better part, she got her promotion the year after.<br></div></blockquote>My sch principal also shut down CCAs 2 years ago. He said those CCAs not producing any results so he shut them down. So Science and Tech Society, Badminton and a few others were shut down. Science and Tech revived as IT CLub though.<br><br>Luckily our principal is alright with student videographers and photographers. Maybe its because my CCA has a very good CCA teacher who fights for our rights.<br><br>But right now there is another problem. Clubs and Societies are treated as 2nd-grade CCAs from this year onwards!!! Which means students cannot choose ONLY a club or society CCA. If they wanna take clubs and societies CCA, they need to have either Sports, Performing Arts or Uniformed as their core or second CCA. WTF!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>This is utter discrimination! Clubs and societies can produce better students then some other CCAs (I don't mean that the other CCAs are bad or anything) and we can learn skills as well! From what I know, CCAs are organisations in the school which students can take part based on their interest or if they want to learn new skills.<br><br>I hate is when principals only think about results, winning competitions, building the school reputation so that they can have a promotion...<br><br>And whats the hype about MOE ministers visiting the school?!?! This is ridiculous <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>If only the minister takes some time to ask students about their opinion of the school. Principal kena demoted immediately I suppose <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

If we are forced to pay, then why is it called DONATION? Extortion will be a better word.<br><br>And the tablet PC gaming sessions caused the electricity bills to skyrocket... Sec 3s are now commonly seen outside the Recording Studio using the wireless router from outside. I shut the router down already.<br><br>From Wikipedia,<br><blockquote>There have been recent confirmed reports that the school has undertaken certain drastic measures as a form of cost-containment. The school has been charging students for the amount of paper used and air-conditioning systems are deactivated periodically to reduce the utilities bill. Such result in many amongst the heavily segregated community of students and the teaching force who might voice their opinion openly. Though so, those at the school's highest appear tranquil and choose to continue holding open-housing events that require heavy-duty funding, Response has been satisfactory to many at the moment.<br><br>A considerable number of teachers have voluntarily taken their leave at a point of the school where the principal, describes it as momentous. Though the schools' many aspects have improved by leaps and bounds in recent years, one has to acknowledge that for all these to take place, sacrifices have been made by those who refuse to indulge in such a glory so honourary potrayed. Sentiments prove that the school has taken a totally new approach to the idea of educating students and creating new batches of students whom after graduating, most of whom will have left nothing but superficial achievements. The school is willing to undertake a heavy price to educate his students in his way that once again, proves his ruthless valour and determination to inculcate his values in students.<br><br>Recent reports show that the tablet PCs programme, part of the schoolÂ’s many IT initiatives, has backfired. Numerous students are attracted towards the idea of challenging classmate over the Local Area Network, otherwise known as LAN gaming. This goes to show that the continuing generation of students may not readily incline towards such unconventional methods of teaching as proposed by (principal's name), the principal of the school. Segregation in the school's community can easily be seen by the differing goals each CCA groups have in mind. Certain CCA groups, especially the Aesthetics, have been given what some might say "almost impossible" goals to acheieve, including performances all-year round, and targeted awards at the Singapore Youth Festival Competition Series.<br><br>This sometimes bring up the idea that there are indeed numerous far-sighted goals so aggressively attempted by individuals whose heads and visions have been heavily clouded by the opportunities presented to them that the motives sometimes go against each other. At such a point in time, the school has acquired a new statement in its ever-changing way of living, which is to maintain its bilingualism of both English and Mandarin. This may certainly prove adequate to sustain the school for the next few years, though many will be yearning for a better long-term and steadfast alternative. It is notable that the school's leader has readily implemented programmes worthy of its attention, such as the tablet programme funded by a third party.</blockquote>This guy rocks <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
