            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large">50 Lessons in Life</span><br>Found in The Plain Dealer, Cleveland, Ohio<br><br>To celebrate growing older, I once wrote the 45 lessons life taught me. It is the most-requested column I've ever written. My odometer rolls over this week, so here's an update:<br><br>1. Life isn't fair, but it's still good.<br><br>2. When in doubt, just take the next small step.<br><br>3. Life is too short to waste time hating anyone.<br><br>4. Don't take yourself so seriously. No one else does.<br><br>5. Pay off your credit cards every month.<br><br>6. You don't have to win every argument. Agree to disagree.<br><br>7. Cry with someone. It's more healing than crying alone.<br><br>8. It's OK to get angry with God. He can take it.<br><br>9. Save for retirement starting with your first paycheck.<br><br>10. When it comes to chocolate, resistance is futile.<br><br>11. Make peace with your past so it won't screw up the present.<br><br>12. It's OK to let your children see you cry.<br><br>13. Don't compare your life to others. You have no idea what their journey is all about.<br><br>14. If a relationship has to be a secret, you shouldn't be in it.<br><br>15. Everything can change in the blink of an eye. But don't worry; God never blinks.<br><br>16. Life is too short for long pity parties. Get busy living, or get busy dying.<br><br>17. You can get through anything if you stay put in today.<br><br>18. A writer writes. If you want to be a writer, write.<br><br>19. It's never too late to have a happy childhood. But the second one is up to you and no one else.<br><br>20. When it comes to going after what you love in life, don't take no for an answer.<br><br>21. Burn the candles, use the nice sheets, wear the fancy lingerie. Don't save it for a special occasion. Today is special.<br><br>22. Over-prepare, then go with the flow.<br><br>23. Be eccentric now. Don't wait for old age to wear purple.<br><br>24. The most important sex organ is the brain.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>25. No one is in charge of your happiness except you.<br><br>26. Frame every so-called disaster with these words: 'In five years, will this matter?'<br><br>27. Always choose life.<br><br>28. Forgive everyone everything.<br><br>29. What other people think of you is none of your business.<br><br>30. Time heals almost everything. Give time time.<br><br>31. However good or bad a situation is, it will change.<br><br>32. Your job won't take care of you when you are sick. Your friends will. Stay in touch.<br><br>33. Believe in miracles.<br><br>34. God loves you because of who God is, not because if anything you did or didn't do.<br><br>35. Whatever doesn't kill you really does make you stronger.<br><br>36. Growing old beats the alternative - dying young.<br><br>37. Your children get only one childhood. Make it memorable.<br><br>38. Read the Psalms. They cover every human emotion.<br><br>39. Get outside every day. Miracles are waiting everywhere.<br><br>40. If we all threw our problems in a pile and saw everyone else's, we'd grab ours back.<br><br>41. Don't audit life. Show up and make the most of it now.<br><br>42. Get rid of anything that isn't useful, beautiful, or joyful.<br><br>43. All that truly matters in the end is that you loved.<br><br>44. Envy is a waste of time. You already have all you need.<br><br>45. The best is yet to come.<br><br>46. No matter how you feel, get up, dress up, and show up.<br><br>47. Take a deep breath. It calms the mind.<br><br>48. If you don't ask, you don't get.<br><br>49. Yield.<br><br>50. Life isn't tied with a bow, but it's still a gift.<br><br>(p.s got this in an email)</div>
