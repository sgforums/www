              <p>If you cannot be happy for the couple, don't bother to even show up. Weddings are happy occassions, so don't mar it with your thinking that its a "summons".  I don't know about other people but the wedding dinner is held to celebrate the occassion and its not expected that the guests should foot the bill. Its not a profit making event. If any couple thinks that way (I know of many such people and I regretted going to their weddings) then, you have every right to reject turning up. Its your time and money, you do not need to bend to peer pressure.</p>

              <div>Come next month, I expect to receive 2 wedding invitations. Or
                  to put it bluntly, it should be what we called ...2 summons.<br> <br> When you are invited to a wedding dinner, you are expected to pay
                  for your share of the food. The higher the class of the restaurant,
                  the higher you are expected to pay. Hotels and ballrooms seem to
                  charge the highest for the dinners.<br> <br> And we fear if the dinner is held at a 6-star hotel. And if it is
                  held in such posh places, I will check with the hotel for the table
                  price. By current standard, I think the ang pow in such place
                  should be in excess of $200 per person.<br> <br> Strangely, although we are more or less paying for the wedding
                  dinner, we have no say in the venue.<img title="Big Grin" src="http://sgforums.com/forums/8/topics/images/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=""><br> <br> And strangely, no bride or groom will ever think of showing
                  consideration to the guests by holding the dinner at less expensive
                  restaurants. All they think about is their own interests. They want
                  a grand wedding .....yeah, but at whose expenses?<br> <br> So, if you are thinking of your wedding dinner, please remember who
                  pays for the food. Surely you don't want your dear friends and
                  relatives to borrow money to attend your wedding dinner. Have a
                  heart!</div>

              </blockquote>
              <p>How much ang pow is up to you . If you like face or you are close to them, you give more. If you don't care or don't really know them, you give less. If you are very stingy and still want face , don't go. It is not like a friend or relative gets married every day or month in one single year.</p>
              <p>Why should a bride or groom ever think of picking a less expensive restaurant? Chinese is all about "face". More expensive , more "face". Furthermore it is their day - hopefully a once in a lifetime thing , not yours. Who are you to dictate where they should hold their celebration just because it does not suit you? If you don't like where they are going , don't go.  Why make so much noise about it?</p>
              <p>Either a) you are not chinese and you don't know the culture, or b) if you are chinese, are you really that stingy? .</p>

              that's why maybe it's better to ask your guests not to write their names on the red packet. instead ask them to write either the female side or male side. like if the bride is called Veron then put veron at the back. if the groom is lawrence, then put lawrence at the back. in this way, you can seperate the red packets for different family.
              
              this i feel will not create the "you give how much, i give how much". if that family is not well to do, how? others give 200 but they gave 100, you are going to LOOK DOWN on them? as some mentioned, it's your wedding where you INVITED them to share your joy, not make money out of it or try to recouped your cost. if it's so expensive and you have difficulties paying for it, don't hold a wedding banquet, hold a buffet lunch or dinner. you don't want to be debt ridden for a wedding you can't afford.
              
              end of the day, your friends or family will not remember your wedding. there are too many to remember. i don't even remember all my cousin's weddings or where it was held. didn't even give a damn. why? cos' it's not mine.

              <p>Problem is not all the friends can afford it.</p>
              <p>I got married in Oz so we had gift registry instead.  Even when picking for our gifts, we picked different items ranging from $30 to $250 just to cater for people with different budget.</p>
