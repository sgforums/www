            <div class='col-md body'><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Titor" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Titor</a><br><br>John Titor is the name of a purported time traveller from the year 2036. He posted on several time travel-related Internet bulletin boards during 2000/2001. A notable feature of Titor's claims is that they are literate, elaborate, evocative, and reasonably consistent; they are even accompanied by photographic evidence. As a result, many have come to believe his claims (especially in the pseudoscientific community); however, many who are more skeptical hold that his claims are a hoax or possibly an example of kookery, and still others are taking a "wait and see" approach until there is definite evidence one way or the other.<br><br>During the period Titor posted on bulletin boards, he made many specific, falsifiable predictions about events in the near future that will ultimately prove his story true or false. He also gave an explicit, detailed account; below is a composite of his statements.<br><br>Titor claimed to be a serving soldier who was recruited to a governmental time travel project. He was supposedly sent from 2036 back to 1975 to retrieve an IBM 5100 computer which he claimed was needed to overcome a Unix bugâ€”Unix-based machines would no longer function after 2038, a known bug related to the 32-bit nature of the Unix clock.<br><br>He then travelled to 2000 to visit his family, including his infant self. He also stated that he wished to see the effects of the millennium bug.<br><br>Titor began open discussion on Internet bulletin boards, apparently to gauge people's reactions upon encountering an actual time traveler. His first post was on November 2, 2000, initially using the username Timetravel_0 before switching to John Titor. It is therefore possible that "John Titor" is a pseudonym, perhaps derived from Timetravel_0, plus a terminal r as in timetraveller.<br><br>This picture, taken in Autumn of 2035, according to Titor, depicts his training officer inside the time displacement vehicle. He is shining a laser pointer out the window, which appears to bend under the extreme gravitational forces.<br><br>Titor was also happy to hold question-and-answer sessions during his stay. Many find that a provocative aspect of Titor's story is that it is accompanied by a well-described theory of how exactly Titor manages to travel in time that is consistent with known concepts of time travel and black hole mechanics, along with the philosophical impact on Titor's society created by the realisation of the existence of multiple timelines..........<span style="font-style: italic;">continued</span><br></div>
