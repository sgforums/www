            <div class='col-md body'>Does God really answer our prayer?<br><br>Hmmm...<br><br>Firstly, I have one question to ask you.  Is God your servant or your Master?  If you know the answer, I guess you would be able to put a lot of things into perspective.<br><br>Well, I can speak for God.  But I speak from my personal experience and from all the homilies I've heard in church.<br><br>I don't know what you had prayed for.  Maybe you have your problems in life.  We all do have problems.  We all have our crosses to carry, just like Jesus did.  If you want to be to a disciple of Jesus, you have to take up your crosses, but dont' worry, because Jesus will be there to carry your cross along with you.  So I hope you find the courage and strength to take up your crosses.<br><br>It's not a matter of whether you have strong or weak faith.  The crux is not to waver in your faith.  We should not be dismayed.  When you feel bound by doubt, recall all that you have seen or heard - all the things that have been given to you by God - the people around you, everything you have, all the goodness you have, and yes your life.  That is a greatest gift...and the love God has for you.<br><br>As to whether God answers our prayers?  He does.  Look at miracles that have happened from Lourdes to Fatima...When God doesn't answer our prayer, it doesn't mean He has abandoned us.  He never abandoned us.  He is there and he knows your every need and want.  Maybe God has his plans for you.  He may not answer your prayer in the exact way you want, right now.  He might answer your prayer later, or in a different way which you might not expect.  Whatever it is, you must believe, that God knows your needs and knows your prayers.  He will answer your prayers some day if what you pray for is for your own good (in God eyes; not our own eyes)...God will not give you something bad, or something which might hurt you.  So don't worry.<br><br>Seek God's will.  Our will may not be God's will for us.<br><br>Remember The Lord's Prayer.<br><br>Your kingdom come, Your will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven.<br><br>When you seek to do God's will, I am sure you will find your answers.</div>
