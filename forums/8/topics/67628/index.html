            <div class='col-md body'>Bored or unhappy, the saboteurs lie for MCs and do personal chores on office time<br><br>By Li Xueying<br><br>LAST year, Ms K. Sim called in sick with a touch of flu, a head-splitting migraine and stomach cramps that left her bent double.<br><br>She took four or five days of medical leave.<br><br>But in fact, she had cooked up these ailments to avoid going to work.<br><br>'I lay in bed, depressed about having to get up, take the MRT and go to the office. I just couldn't face going to work,' she said.<br><br>Ms Sim, 27, said <strong>she hates her job as an administration executive in a trading company, because she finds it boring. It doesn't help that her relationship with her boss is strained.<br></strong><br>A Sunday Times survey on Singaporeans' work attitudes found plenty of people like her. One in 10 admitted asking for a medical certificate (MC) to avoid going to work.<br><br>Nearly four in 10, or 38 per cent, said they didn't care about their work; and 3 per cent said outright that they hate what they do.<br><br>Of those polled, 36 per cent said they had been dissatisfied with work at one time or another; and as many said they would not recommend their jobs to others.<br><br>And how do workers deal with their unhappiness?<br><br>They sashay to work late, refuse to work overtime, disparage their companies, and carry out personal chores during office time.<br><br>These are the 'sabo workers' - unhappy employees who get back at their employers.<br><br>Baker's Inn owner Daniel Tay, who has about 120 employees, said he's had enough of workers who abuse his trust and goodwill.<br><br>He used to let workers call in sick, without an MC. But some began doing it too often.<br><br>A chef at one outlet borrowed $4,000 from the company, and then promptly took two weeks' medical leave, claiming he had a heart attack. He was found out, sacked, and made to return the money.<br><br>Two months ago, when employees called in sick, Mr Tay started asking for the numbers on their MCs and checking with the clinics that gave out the MCs.<br><br>Since then, the number calling in sick has halved to about five a month.<br><br>Though he's not caught employees spitting on a customer's food, or stealing, he's considering installing security cameras in the kitchens.<br><br>Not all unhappy workers become malingerers or subversive malcontents. Some show up for work, but just don't put in 100 per cent on the job.<br><br>Mr Tan Yi Siong, 24, an event planning assistant, admits he's one of them. He said: <strong>'I find my work meaningless. But I can't leave because there are no jobs for me out there.<br></strong><br>'I don't deliberately sabo my company, like taking MC when I don't need it, or stealing stationery. <strong>But I'm certainly not giving it my all.'</strong><br><br>A Gallup survey of workers from 11 countries reported last September that dissatisfied Singapore workers cost the economy $4.9 billion a year in lost productivity, and poor employee management is the root cause.<br><br>Human resource experts say The Sunday Times' estimate of 'sabo workers' isn't alarmingly high, <strong>but bosses would do well to examine their human resource practices.<br></strong><br>Mr Koh Juan Kiat, executive director of the Singapore National Employers Federation, said: <strong>'Such actions are usually symptomatic of outdated human resource practices out of sync with employees' aspirations.' </strong><br><br>For instance, if a company is so inflexible that it won't allow emergency leave, workers may resort to lying to get MCs. Companies should review their practices every two years, said Mr Koh.<br><br>Those who took part in The Sunday Times poll said their job satisfaction would improve if they were better paid and given more challenging work.<br><br>Accounts executive Lyn Ong, 26, who admits she sends personal e-mail messages during office hours, said <strong>her attitude towards her 'boring' job 'borders on hatred'.</strong><br><br>She hopes to move on to financial analysis next year.<br><br>'I do this because it's the only thing my degree groomed me for. I have to drag myself out of bed every day to face rows and rows of numbers. I don't like to sit at my desk, bash away at the computer, and nitpick at details.<br><br><strong>'I hate the mundaneness.'</strong><br><br>[/quote]<br><br>THE WORKERS<br><br>The Happy Campers<br><br>Â• 65% would recommend their jobs to someone.<br><br>Â• 86% feel they're in the right job that uses their skills and expertise.<br><br>Â• 83% feel there is a sense of team spirit among their colleagues.<br><br>Â• 95% are very committed or committed to their jobs.<br><br>Â• 73% are very willing or willing to work overtime without extra pay.<br><br>Â• 67% feel their workload is 'just right'.<br><br>Â• 75% feel their working hours are 'just right'.<br><br>Â• 78% are very satisfied or satisfied with their pay.<br><br>Â• Of the 16% who received a pay cut in the past year, 67% feel it's justified.<br><br>The Sabo Worker<br><br>Â• 14% are contemplating changing their jobs in the next year.
