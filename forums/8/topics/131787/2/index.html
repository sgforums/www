I'm one of those guys who have to sit by the production line inspecting for chip defaults (like soldering fault) with an electronic microscope.<br><br>Its really straining for the eyes as your eyes have to be really sharp. If there is a soldering fault which we can't pick up, then we have to do the whole lot again and this is really a big headache for one's colleagues. Moreover its a 12 hours shift and normally after work, I would just go to a local garden to relax my eyes.<br><br>Good for you you quitted it. Of the many jobs I have had, thats really one of the toughest job in my life.</div>

Oil prices have been on its way up and looked set to stay for quite some time. So this sector is hiring, both experienced and new guys.<br><br>In the offshore construction sector I am currently in, we construct stuffs that will be transported offshore for installation. In my career, I have been to some places with names I could not pronunce and also places where one does not want to leave. Had worked in  West Africa, North Africa, Middle East, Far East, North, Central &amp; South Americas, Central Asia, Subcontinent, Pacific ream etc. The benifits are reasonable and the thrill are always there. The down side of things are you could not pay income tax, have to go on R&amp;R every four to eight weeks, lived in a reasonable hotel most of the time and most of your expenses paid for you.<br><br>But seriously, if you don't like to travel and could not lived without your mum's cooking, then this is certainly not good. I spend at least eight to nine months living away from home, spend more time talking to hookers than my own GF. Mixed up languages when I come home, e.g., trying to speak spanish with my Malay friends. Have less friends because you ceased to be part of their daily lives.<br><br>As for openings, the sector needs lots of engineers, logistics and IT personnel. The last going rate I heard for enginners willing to travel to a certain Middle Eastern country is approximately USD 1.5K/day, but insurance not covered!<br><br>If anyone's interested, I will elabrate more on the job scope. let me know.<br><br></div></blockquote>My Dad was in the offshore oil and gas industry.A real challenge if you want to see the world <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
