            <div class='col-md body'>Hi folks, I understand that there are a lot of teenagers in this forum. I was wondering if it would be helpful for them (or even working adults) if we describe our jobs here a bit to give others an insight of what we have to face everyday at work.<br><br>As per any good thread, here are the simple guidelines you might want to consider. Of course you can diverge from these guidelines.<br><br>a)	Describe as clearly as possible what your company deals with. This will allow readers to understand this industry better.<br>b)	Describe what your designation is and what your job scope is.<br>c)	Describe your everyday work activity<br>d)	Pros and cons of this position<br>e)	Any other useful advice for people wanting to get into your position?<br><br>The main aim of this thread, may I reiterate, is to allow readers to<br>a)	understand other industries better (to know the insight story)<br>b)	know how to get into this particular job and realize their dreams<br></div>

As for any other job, this job is a stressful one as it entails datelines. It requires creative thinking, perseverance and analytical thinking (just to name a few).<br><br>My main objective is to generate good publications for the university so that it maintains its high reputation and ranking. In order to do that, my job is to read widely about the current state-of-art and think creatively of how to improve current works. These ideas will be drawn upon perhaps other publications and are normally based on foundations that I received during my undergraduate.<br><br>Once a possibly feasible solution is achieved through theory, then I have to run series and series of simulations on a normal PC to verify this new solution. This is where perseverance comes into play. If results are not good, I will have to go back to theory again and correct any errors. This verification stage can go on for months. Once good results and strong theoretical basis is established, IÂ’ll have to prepare publications in the form of journals and conference proceedings.<br><br>So 90 percent of the time, I work in front of my laptop or PC doing simulations. The rest of the time is working with (blank) papers and pens, searching for information, reading other works and surf.<br><br>My secondary duties are to teach undergraduates in tutorials and oversee students in Labs. I have to advice final year and masters projects as well. Other functions include writing research proposals and submit them to funding bodies so as to fund new projects.<br><br>One of the best thing about this job is it allows one to travel extensively once my work has been accepted to be presented in a conference. I get to meet great researchers as well. Most of the expenses are paid for by taxpayers (sorry about that folks). Unless there are teaching duties, there is absolutely no office hours for this job and we can work from anywhere anytime. The downside is that it can be frustrating at times trying to make things work. Most of the time, I have to bring problems to sleep. Thinking about the problems IÂ’m trying to solve over meal and sleep is a norm. Working 7 days a week is a norm but of course there are off-peak periods for example a milestone is reached.<br><br>One of the main requirements for this job is of course to get a good first degree so that at least the foundations are there. Another is a creative mind and perseverance. Being able to work independently is crucial.<br><br>Lots of myth about researchers being a boring person is false.

In my career, I have been to some places with names I could not pronunce and also places where one does not want to leave. Had worked in  West Africa, North Africa, Middle East, Far East, North, Central &amp; South Americas, Central Asia, Subcontinent, Pacific ream etc. The benifits are reasonable and the thrill are always there. The down side of things are you could not pay income tax, have to go on R&amp;R every four to eight weeks, lived in a reasonable hotel most of the time and most of your expenses paid for you.<br><br>But seriously, if you don't like to travel and could not lived without your mum's cooking, then this is certainly not good. I spend at least eight to nine months living away from home, spend more time talking to hookers than my own GF. Mixed up languages when I come home, e.g., trying to speak spanish with my Malay friends. Have less friends because you ceased to be part of their daily lives.<br><br>As for openings, the sector needs lots of engineers, logistics and IT personnel. The last going rate I heard for enginners willing to travel to a certain Middle Eastern country is approximately USD 1.5K/day, but insurance not covered!<br><br>If anyone's interested, I will elabrate more on the job scope. let me know.<br><br></div>

Any of your expertise view regarding this?<br><br>What is your job scope like? Are you an engineer? Or do you sell oil to customers? Do you work in an oil rig or something?</div>
