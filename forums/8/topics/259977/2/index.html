            <div class='col-md body'>mayb you din visit her for so long that's why her condition worsen.  Probably she miss you and get depressed and affected her health when she hope you go see her but you din.   So go before it's too late!<br><br>just wanna share with you my story.  my late aunt who got breast cancer is my favourite aunt.  She doted on me and gave me pocket $$$ when my mum refused to give me.  During her days under treatment, I struggled so much as to visit her or not becos when I thot I see her my heart will drop and I won't be able to take it.  Like what you said about your granny, my late aunt was also not herself like before.  Finally, I plucked up my courage I went.  She was happy to see me and even joked about don't know what happen to her and she seem to put on weight.   Not long after that she passed away, I was crying like crazy at the wake.  I regretted not visiting her often when she was alive.  Till this day, she remains my favourite aunt!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is my personal experience and I wish to share with TS just in case he lives to regret it just like me.<br><br>I'm close to my grandma. She's the one who brought me and my siblings up while my parents were busy earning a living to make ends meet. Ah Ma, was never stingy when it came to the general well being of my siblings and I. We got what we need though life was really hard.<br><br>As I grew up in my teens, Ah Ma started aging suddenly. I didnt' take notice of it, she was losing weight slowly no longer the strong Ah Ma that I know when I was a child. I started doing part time jobs and I gave Ah Ma some pocket money. A few weeks before my Ah Ma passed away, she started behaving oddly, she picked on me, threw the money I have her to me. Being young, I was angry so angry that I didn't want to talk to her. So even when she stopped talking because she wasn't feelign well I was kind of happy cos suddenly she stopped scolding me. Until one evening, my Ah Ma just couldn't move about any more. WE had to call for an ambulance to bring her to the hospital, while waiting for the ambulance, Ah Ma held my hand and look at me with tears in her eyes. That was when I know that things are not going to be the same anymore. True enough, 4 days later, Ah Ma went away..the biggest regret that me and my siblings have in life now would be that Ah Ma is no longer with us to enjoy the finer things in life cos we have started earnign our own keep. ..<br><br>To TS, if you think that going to visit your Ah Ma every Sunday will make things better then you are wrong, at her age, every single min is important, you have not visit her for 3 long years...cherish whatever chance you have to visit her...visit her more often..I"m sure you can visit her more often than just once a week...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TS, my grandma scenario almost the same as yours. She move around my uncles and aunties home until they finally decide to put her in the nursing home 7 years ago. By then she had dementia, and was bed-ridden<br><br>Yet, I don't blame my aunties, uncles or even my dad for doing so. Look at it this way. They have their own lives to live. The adults would have 2 work in the morning, the children have 2 go to school. No one is at home most of the time. And usually, during this long time from morning to evening, there's always a big possibility that something may happen to her, and no one is at home. Putting her in a old folks home/nursing home is the best possible way out.<br><br>Anyway, back to my grandma. 8 months after my grandma was put in the nursing home, we receive a call that we better rush down to the nursing home as it seems my grandma could possibly pass away that night. That evening, we went to visit her. I remember how her face lit up when she saw us(as she doted on me and my sis a lot when we were young).<br><br>The next morning at around 8plus, the nursing home called to say that my grandma had pass away. It seems as if she wanted to see her children and grandchildren before she leaves.<br><br>I just hope she's happy wherever she is now.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Your grandma's more important than your relatives.  If visiting her means having to bump into them, so be it... when they see how unafraid you are to be there for your grandma, somehow, they'll feel the guilt through all their denial...</div>
