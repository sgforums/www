Our ministers are getting don't know how many tens of thousands per month, excluding allowances this and that. Frankly, we have heard too often that these top-notch leaders all they do is attend meetings, travel overseas and sign on the dot. The details and actual work are done by the subordinates.<br><br>With the average worker's income averaging slightly over a thousand dollars, are we living as peasants feeding the king ?<br><br><strong>Is the sky high salary justified for them ?</strong><br></div>

So for those of you who believe that they are paid too high(still lower than what they can get in pte sector), I pose the question : Will you serve the nation in the capacity of a minister and willingly suffer a big difference in pay? If not, are you in a position to judge that they are holding too high salaries? In the first place, how many of us understand the job scope of the ministers?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I'm doing my ITP(Industrial Training Program) now, and my pay is like, $1 an HOUR. So here's the situation at my workplace.<br><br>My supervisor (the guy giving me the grades for my ITP), gives me ton of work, and fine, I do it. But I take my time doing it. I occassionally doze off at work, since work is monotonous, and since I'm getting lousy pay, I try to come in as late as possible, and do as little work as possible, and leave as early as possible.<br><br>Well, the supervisor wasn't too happy about it, then he gives me this lecture about how an employee should behave, which I am fully aware of, but since I'm getting a pay of $1 an HOUR, why the heck should I give you the dedication of someone doing the same job, but earns maybe $1300 a month ? I mean, at $1 an HOUR, I might as well work as a road sweeper, and earn more than that.<br><br>If I'm the guy earning $1300 a month, and not $1 an hour, sure, I'll work my butt off if need be, but I'm not, so why should I give my all for a bunch of people who isn't paying me what I deserve, and SHOULD get ?<br><br>Now, apply this to a Minister. If you don't pay me well, why should I go through all the agonizing agonies of doing the job, making sure YOUR life is nice and peaceful ? Why shouldn't I just take my own sweet time about it, and let YOU suffer since you can't afford me ?<br><br>That's my mentality.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Ah well..... time to look for a better job....<br><br>------------------<br>"A Gentleman is not an implement."<br>-Confucius, Analects, 2:12</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As an ITP student, you have your rights to complain to your lecturer if what you are doing does not relate to your course. It helps to feedback too.. because unless you do, you will find that its impossible to file your ITP report at the end of the month.<br><br>Are the rest of the gang getting $1 too? If everyone else is getting the same pay, and you are really learning new things everyday, there's really nothing much to complain about, since its a training project, and you are learning.<br><br>I am afraid labour law do not apply in your case. In fact, labour law requires all employers to pay his employee OT if his basic salary is less than $1500. You will want to bring that up too.. employer also need to make contributions to his employee's CPF account.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Illegal Operation (edited 06 June 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Are you sure ministers can command similar or even higher salaries in the private sector? Among ministers in Singapore, how many have genuinely had their abilities tried and tested in the private sector? That precludes cushy jobs in GLCs.<br><br>Oh, and the average CEO in the US does not earn as much as our top ministers do. Our ministerial pay is pegged to the maverick CEO level.<br><br>In the private sector, CEOs are held accountable for their mistakes. CEOs can be fired if they do not perform. The average staying power of a CEO is a few years (I read somewhere that it's 4 years). Just which of our ministers are responsible for Suzhou, Micropolis, etc? No idea. And they get to stay on as ministers for just about forever. That, combined, is the ultimate form of job security.<br><br>So let's see.

            <div class='col-md body'>I would say, given that the rewards are so good, what is stopping you from becoming a politician to earn those monies ?<br><br>If only you can make the grade to become a minister, you can also make money. There are trade-offs in this job as well.  Your every move is being monitored.  If you do not have a clean record, be prepared to have everything screened and opened.  Much like Monica Lewinsky, why doesn't she sue the President then and sued only after Bill has become the president ?<br><br>For bad investment in other countries, what good does it do you to keep the money in the bank ?  We do need to develop regionally or globally in order to survive this century. However, there will be risks involved in every foreign investment. The ministers are also human and do make mistakes, which businessman never make a single mistake and lose some money. It is important that they learn from such mistakes and prevent future occurance. IMHO, most of the ministers are doing a good job.</div>

Perhaps you haven't noticed, but in Singapore it's only the opposition politicians who have their every move monitored and their dirty laundry aired in the government-controlled media. Nary a word about the ugly side of PAP fellows.<br><br>No one's disputing the need for foreign  investment. But we are talking accountability here. We are talking colossal mistakes amounting to losses in billions. Do we know which ministers made those mistakes? Did the government acknowledge the mistakes in the first place, or did we have to read between the lines of bureaucratic doublespeak to realise that a bucketload of our taxpayers' money was lost? Any company CEO would be SACKED immediately for making such comparatively huge losses. Given the undeniable importance of our reserves, why should these overpaid, errant ministers deserve a second chance after squandering it? Where is the openess in government?<br><br>By what criterion do you judge that the performance of our ministers has been mostly good? You don't really know what goes on behind the corridors of power, do you? Even the former President ran into problems when he tried to find out exactly how much we had in our reserves.<br><br>Among our current ministers, a significant number belong to the scholar category. Most, if not all, came from already well-to-do backgrounds. No "heartlanders". There's the elite guard for you.<br><br>Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? (Who guards the guards?)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Basically, if you intend to challenge the power, you would need to be extremely bright and sparkling clean. Period.<br><br>The Suchou Saga has attracted a large amount of feedback and we all know the issues surrounding it.  Though I am not in the Government service, my past work experience in MNC exposed us in business dealing in China.  It is a completely different environment and we are badly bitten.  Somehow, if you are not prepared to take a plunge in being among the first in the business, you most probably would not succeed as much as the pioneers. Unless we can pinpoint that the CEOs are going against the wishes of his board to invest thus losing money, it would perhaps be possible for the board to remove him. My past directors made plenty of mistakes and lost many millions, he is still the CEO of the damn public listed company as there are no other better choice to replace him.  Furthermore, he started the company before it became public.<br><br>The elected president was a new role given autonomy on the reserves. It definitely would create some unhappiness initially. All these would straighten in time.  Given that both parties has already aired their views openly, you have right to your opinions.<br><br>I take it that the government will have to be accountable for the money, I view them as a banker and that when my time is up, I WILL receive MY money !<br><br>As for background of these ministers, if you have the ability to challenge them, I do not bother whatever background you are from.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The government is accountable for the money, as you say... but to whom? Not to the people, certainly, for we've never once had the benefit of full or even partial disclosure. Where and what are our reserves? How much exactly was lost in imprudent investments?<br><br>Fine and good that your CEO is still around after making horrid losses. But the key point to note is that the shareholders know he made those losses and permitted him to stay for lack of a better candidate. Do we even know who's responsible for Suzhou, Micropolis, etc? Where is the openess? Many Singaporeans would not even hear a whiff of it if not for the internet and foreign publications, for nothing of substance was ever mentioned in local papers. Once again, we go back to the accountability issue.<br><br>You said : "The elected president was a new role given autonomy on the reserves."<br><br>Hmm... I seem to recall the SM publicly contradicting that very stance not too long ago. Do you?<br><br>Yes, we all know that an opposition aspirant should be squeaky clean, but that is a separate issue altogether. The original question was, and still is, are our ministers overpaid?<br><br>Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? (Who guards the guards?)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If it was indeed decided that it should be cover-up, would we expect to hear anything at all ?<br><br>I believe we should not the pin the failings of some minister's wife to conclude that the government failed. Their primary role is to ensure that the country is well run, I regard the others as bonuses should there be rewards. In this instance, the failure of Micropolis and Suzhou got big coverage, was there no redeeming profits derived from other profitable segments within her organisation ?  Personally, look at then differently as different people rather than group them as ONE dynasty.  It would have been fairer to them.  We probably would not be as critical if they do not share the same family roots.<br><br>Anyway, I do not suppose I will get any benefits from the GIC apart from the fact that we could be treated quite differently compared to citizens from other countries if they are successful.<br><br>For the elected president's power, all along know his power is mainly ceremonial with some executive power on the reserves.  I suspect that OTC had wanted to use that power to please the people when we were in recession.  I thot it was better that none of those monies were used to tie us over to set a precedent since the elected president comes into the picture.<br><br>Back to the original question, their salaries are pegged to the top 5% of the public sector.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Because a complete public shut-out on such a colossal scale is patently impossible. International and astute local observers are always on the prowl, and they certainly do not fall within the control of our government. However, in the Straits Times, this is the rough sequence of coverage :<br><br>1. Everything's going smoothly, hurrah<br>2. SM makes noise about the notorious chicaneries of the Chinese officials<br>3. More reports on games the Chinese play<br>4. Very pregnant silence<br>5. Partial pull-out, control ceded to China authorities<br>6. DPM says it was a good "learning experience".<br><br>The "oops, sorry, some of us made a mistake" part was conveniently left out. Everyone sang to the tune of "it's all China's fault." The full details were not forthcoming, but grumblings about the Chinese actions were all over the place. So there was at least a partial cover-up in the local news media, wouldn't you agree?<br><br>Between 1 and 2, vague rumours ran around. Between 2 and 4, these rumours got very alarming indeed. At 4, a clearer picture came out via other sources (Int'l and internet) that no one officially admitted to or, more ominously, denied.<br><br>I didn't mention anything about a certain family. Let's not go down that slope, huh? I merely asked for accountability in the realm of investments financed using taxpayers' money. Our GLCs have taken poundings in many ventures in China and Vietnam, but Temasek Holdings doesn't seem to be accountable to its shareholders - we, the citizens of Singapore.<br><br>I didn't say the government failed. But that's not to say the government doesn't have its failings. Sure, there are successes as well as failures, and the former probably outstrips the latter, for all I know. But I don't think it's too much to ask for some accountability. As a Singaporean, I would feel safer knowing our reserves are in safe hands.<br><br>But to stick to the pay issue, let's get some perspective. ST earlier this year put the pay of Alex Au, CEO of OCBC, at $500,000 P.A. A minister typically earns double that figure.<br><br>Even in Sembawang Corporation, the largest GLC in Singapore, the top 3 directors are each paid about $450,000 P.A.<br><br>Of course, directors have stock options, but these are open to risk, even more so in the current climate of uncertainty. These shares can be worthless when the stock market is weak. Many of the bigwigs lost substantial fortunes in 1997 when the market plunged. No such risks for our ministers.</div>
