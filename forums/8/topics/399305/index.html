              <p>I know of a blogger friend who is 31~32, has about $400k in assets generating $1.6k divvy per month, yet not married yet. I think got go dates, but maybe not attached also. His annual income from work is about $80k</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: georgia; color: #009900;">A: I would expect 
              him to earn at least $12,000 a month. Anything less than that is either 
              he is lousy or deserve a lesser human form as wife.</span></p>

              <p>Hi, how about you yourself?</p>
              <p>What is your definition of above average $$$?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I know of a blogger friend who is 31~32, has about $400k in
              assets generating $1.6k divvy per month, yet not married yet. I
              think got go dates, but maybe not attached also. His annual income
              from work is about $80k</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On his blog of 4 girls he met in his Masters class:</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: georgia; color: #009900;">A: I would expect him to
              earn at least $12,000 a month. Anything less than that is either he
              is lousy or deserve a lesser human form as wife.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: georgia; color: #009900;">B: He does not need to earn
              the sky, but he must provide everything for me. I will not want to
              fork out a single cent for my wedding and matrimonial
              home.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: georgia; color: #009900;">C: I have even “simpler”
              needs. He just need to ensure that I can give up my job anytime I
              want to, possibly if I want to retire by 35, he is able to provide
              for me and our kids. Hopefully he has his own business and I can
              give up my job to help him. But he must at least be matching my
              $10,000 salary now lah! Or else no point giving up my job to work
              with him right? (Well, his business must be doing extremely well
              then!!)</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: georgia; color: #009900;">D: Well, I expect a
              romantic proposal from him. Just a wonderful private apartment
              bought under my name will do. I will love him more!</span></p>
