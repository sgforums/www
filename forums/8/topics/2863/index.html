It occurs to me that very soon the bad sectors will go up in an exponential scale.. Is that gonna happen?!<br>And uhm, the number of bad sectors seem to shoot up after I installed ICQ... is that a legitimate observation?<br><br>Anyone has got any good advice to give? My comp is just over 1 yr old! Must've been the harddisk -- it's Seagate -- heard from a friend that it sux big time.. So I will sincerely appreciate any recommendation that's good and well, wouldn't burn a hole in my pocket...<br><br>I have a 486 comp with a Samsung harddisk that DOESNT HAVE A SINGLE BAD SECTOR and it's been around since 1995..

            <div class='col-md body'>The scanning is involuntary! While Windows is loading, a beep comes on and that blue "Because Windows is not shut down properly blahblahblah" screen comes up. But Windows WAS shut down properly on the previous attempt!<br><br>Then after that the Scandisk screen automatically comes up and of course I see lotsa Bs (bad sectors) on the front three rows. And a couple will inevitably be detected for every run of the scan.<br><br>Anyway, thanx all of you for the advice =) I appreciate that. My computer is still under warranty so I guess I'll just bring the CPU down to the manufacturer...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Meanwhile I pray that the bad sectors don't continue to spread!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey asure speaks truth man...ther's no way for your hardisk to break down from normal usage and scandisks...and like he said...at most it could be a mechanical failure which u can't really do anything about except bring it back under warranty...<br><br>I have 2 Seagate. 1 IBM. my Seagate has been around since 1995 and the newer 6 gig one is working like a charm for the last 2 years...no bad sectors yet...I also have an ibm from 1994...:-)  both are quite reliable and I keep my pc on almost 24 hours everyday...anyway it's on most of the time...<br><br>there is a problem with win 98...I hate that it takes control away from you like scanning at startup because it didn't shut itself down properly even though you told it to shut down....win 98 sucks big time...I suggest upgrading to win 2000....I've been using the beta 3 for thelast 7 months and even though it's a beta it has given me fare less problems than the win 98 OS....and u have more control and it's more powerful...harharhahe...but linuxm,aster kai might have something to say about that...<br><br>and what is this about buying awhole new computer...hey bookmarks...I thought you were dubbed technopreneur of the year by a government body...that's the best advice u can give?...hell, all you need to do nexxie is buy a new harddisk, and upgrade ur operating system....(did I mention that win 98 has a lot of bugs because they didn't really intend for it to saty so long...it was actually meant to be a stepping stone for win2000 but it was finished too late...)...anyway the operating system also has a good deal to do with how your hardisk behaves...<br><br>take win 95 and win 98 for example...you will often hear the disk spin and chatter for no reason whatsoever...even if u just let the computer sit there....and sometimes it really slows down your computer and eats resources...bad bad win98!!...bad boy!<br><br>win 2000(basically winnt) allows you to control how ur hardisk behaves to a certain extent....so yeah...maybe u need to change OS also, but that's even more of a major undertaking than changing the HDD.<br><br>and again, I doubt it would be icq that is causing u to have bad sectors....icq is such a small program and doesn't really need to do much with your harddisk except reside on it physically....you also might want to consider that if you are using heavy graphics photo-editors like photoshop, it relegates your harddisk a sa scratch disk and likes to tear into it like nobodies business....you should hear  the hard disk running when you're editing 50-180MB files...<br><br>Anyway most new HDD are built to be able to withstand high heat and quite a bit of physical shock(but dun push ur luck).  Nexxie...the hotter HDD sometimes need it's own fan...as u know, all PC's come standard with PC fans at the back and/or front of the casing...but some hardware like HDD and Graphics processors and all cpus need their own separate fans attached right onto the hardware itself....but u can tell if ur harddisk has a fan on it...just open the casing and look at the hdd...if u see a fan...it's tehre...hahah:-) As simple as that...<br><br>and...unfortunately, sometimes harddisks just fail and develope bad sectors whetehr you or anything else has done anything to it...It's expected that these sensitive equipment would fail sometimes...sooner or later...but bad luck for u it was sooner...:-)<br><br>anyway I have ranted long enuff...just take the warranty card back with your HDD or pc(however your warranty states it)...usually they will replace it with a new one...but if ur unlucky and u get a bad warranty they will try to fix it for you...wich can take anywhere from 1 week to 3 months (dependign on the guy is lazy fucker or not)...:-8<br><br>It's best to have have an extra HDD dedicated to just backup of all ur essential files...so if the files on ur HDD fail or gets caught in bad sectrs...u can just recall the files back from the second dedicated backup HDD....I plan on doing that also...my HDD is damnz old alread and i have a fear that it will drop dead any time now...if it does...there goes 6 gigs of porn(and growing) and a lot of design fiels...argh!!!<br><br>and finally, it might be a virus....make sure it isn't because if it is it will infect your new HD and do the same thing...or it might even emmulate bad sectors when there are actually none...heheh...clever buggers those viruses...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oh yeah one more thing...just because you have bad sectors doesn't necessarily mean it will spread to other sectors...bad sectors are ususally physical...I dun see how it could spread...unless mold grows on it one...but highly unlikely!!!.....<br><br>I have a few bad sectors on my IBM but as long as you use your scandsik on advanced thourough scanning, it should fix it so that those sectors are never used again...and even when you reformat the HDD it checks the surface of the disk again and cordons off that area so it isn't usable...:-)...yep...even if you delete old dos partitions once it's up and working again it should be fine...unless you have those "lemons" (rememebr the song Lemon Tree)....In industry or manufacturing, there is a percentage of products made that somehow just never turn out right nomatter what...every manufacturere faces this...these faulty items are called lemons...and lots of times these lemons make it into the market place and work for a while before showing it's true colors...and sometimes peoplea re unlucky enuff to own these lemons...ehhe...<br><br>My friend in the states had a Lemon Van...no matter how many times he fixed it or spent money on uograding it something major would go wrong with it...almost every week without fail...even the trimmings and doors would driop off without warning...this is what we call a lemon...products off the assembly line that are jinxed and nomatter what u can't fix it...forver cursed...hahah:-)</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Just some suggestions:<br><br>1. A permanent solution for mp3 files and such would be aquiring a CD-RW drive. The price ranges from $250 to $400+. It may be expensive but its a good long term investment.Furthermore, an external USB port based CD-RW would be easier to setup compared to a slave HD. No mess and you can store all your mp3 files into CDs.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>2. Get a zip drive. It costs $140+ for an Parallel/USB Iomega zip drive. You can use the zip drive to store your irreplaceable files. However most will not recommend a zip disk as a permanent storage medium.<br><br>3. Add a new HD to your existing hardware. Transfer all the files to your new slave HD. However its tedious to install... You would have to open up your CPU casing screw everything in and set the jumpers. A dirty job.<br><br>4. You should backup your files with the above methods before you replace the HD under waranty because if the company replaces your HD... You would lose all the information in it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>5. Check for virus in your applications. eg. Maybe you icq program is infact a trojan virus? Unlikely though. You can get a free copy of anti-virus program at <a href="http://www.avp.ch" rel="nofollow">http://www.avp.ch</a>  to test your files.<br><br>6. If any of your files lies on a bad sector and cannot be duplicated, you can use Norton Utilities to move the data away from the badsector through a HD scan. This will make your data readable again. You can get Norton Utilies from Sim Lim Sq. There maybe other applications that does the samething, however I haven't had the need to use such a program and hence I apologise for not being aware.<br><br>7. Lastly, just some hypothesis about your HD problems. If your HD is placed near your CD-ROM, the frequent jerk of your CD-ROM may in the long term damage your HD. Is your computer placed in an air-conditioned room? Over heating of hardware in your CPU can result in damage. Is your room dusty? Microscopic dust particles can choke up your HD. Ok, I don't think I can think of anymore reasons at the moment.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I love my 2 gig Seagate HD of 4 yrs.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> It doesn't have any badsectors at all and its quieter and more reliable then my Qauntum 10 gig. Maybe this has something to do with Fat16 and Fat32 handling of drive space. Seagate is alright as a brand.<br><br>As for the OS, there is no documentation of Win98 hurting any HD that I am aware of. I think Win98 is a reliable enough OS. After all its the last of dos based Windows operating system. I won't recommend WinNT/Win2000 to anyone just yet as it is not as well supported at the moment by application developers. Furthermore I think Win95/98 hardware drivers are different from that of WinNT/2000. Its a hassle a normal user don't really need. For those that matters, the ability to run dos based programs is also a plus for the nostalgic quality. I tend to have the urge to run old games to have a run.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Hope my 2 cents worth of typing is useful to you dudes.<br><br>Cheers dudes  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">~</div>
