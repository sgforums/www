            <div class='col-md body'>How many of you guys/gals out there were a victim of LDR???....Or how many actually work out???<br><br>Mine didn't work out just 4 months after I left for UK.....the first month was especially terrible for me!!! I tried ways and ways to make her feel I am there for her....by sending her roses every month.....and on her birthday send her one bouquet for each week of the month(coz her bd is month end so I start sending her one bouquet from first week until the last week which I send her 99 roses)....calling her everyday.....<br><br>Although I know no matter how much I do, the fact is still that I am not there with her, but somehow she just don't appreciate it. She could be so sad when I left.....saying how will she cope without me.......suddenly just cry on your shoulder and keep quite...which you know that she had already missed me before I am gone!!! But one week is enough to change everything!!!......<br><br>I am not saying she should remain sad throughout the period when I am "outstationed".......but she just didn't try to appreciate all the things I had done for her......not even a phone call to thank me for the flowers....!!!....Yes....I feel sad and mostly disappointed....but I am glad I had ended this painful experience and move on with my own life....<br><br>My existence then is to make her happy.....and since she is much more happier with her friends.....I shall not hinder her happiness!!!<br><br>This is my story......and what is yours....???<br><br>------------------<br>You've Lost that Lovin' Feeling.....!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Of course, long distance relationship can work. Several friends of mine here too have, even fiance, back in Singapore.  But of course living in two time zones, it will not be easy. I am one that is going through such relationship. I won't call myself a victim because I think it has done more good than harm to relationship.<br><br>I guess during this time apart, our relationship grows stronger on the basis of trust. She still goes out with her friends (guys too). The important thing is that we are willing to give all our effort to keep this relationship going on and that we know we will be together when I finish my studies here.<br><br>Don't be mistaken that "effort" means sending her stuff and all that. By that I meant, in your decisions and actions, know it does not only affects you. And also, much as you want her to appreciate your actions, you too must appreciate hers.<br><br>Anyway, I guess you have to pick up from where you are now. What is more important now is to do well in your studies and not disappoint the others that care.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Shake,<br><br>I can understand how you feel, because I am a victim of a LDR, where it has broken down, where you get your gf being snatched away by some other bloke. I have given up on long distance r/s, thinking that perhaps, I don't happen to be the lucky ones who made it. Still to make you feel optimistic, there is a couple who made it after the gal went to overseas for 4 years, while he was still in NS. And they got married recently, and having a kid. Think about it, that is a perfect r/s, isn't it. However, it is the only one out of 10 which worked out. You and I happened to be the other nine which did not....<br><br>Have a good day.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

The first day I came back I didn't look for her coz she had an exam the next day so I didn't want to distract her, so I stood by the examination hall the next day with a bouquet of roses in my hand(wanted to give her a surprise coz I didn't tell her when I will be back). Yes....she is thrilled to see me, but she didn't send that day with me coz she already made arrangement to go out with frens......so was the next two weeks.....For two weeks after I came back, I only went out with her twice!!!.....she is just isn't treasuring the time I had left!!!....in the end....she decided she could have more fun with her frens(2 guys 2 gals-so it is liek couple couple thingy.....and one of the guy is going after her too) during the Millennium Countdown and abandoned me. I couldn't stand that and asked for the break!!!<br><br>DumDumOne:<br><br>Wish you good luck then. Sometimes it is easy to say "if she dun love you enuff, then it is just too bad lor".....but when you really love someone....it is really hard to let go....!!!......but I sincerely wished that the both of you can make it....and be the 1 out of 10 that can make it!!!<br><br>iamsilly:<br><br>But she hasn't done anything that I can appreciate when I am outstationed....except for 2 postcards in 3 months.....and pissing me off with lotz of things......!!!<br><br>prodigal:<br><br>I used to think I can be the 1 out of 10 coz I believe we really loved each other deep enuff and oso that if we both hard hard for it......but things changes......so do her.......and it is useless if I work alone....!!!<br><br>------------------<br>You've Lost that Lovin' Feeling.....!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm... Long distance relationship...<br>Something that me wanna ask for a long time..<br><br>Ermm.. i think real love cant be measured by the distance of both parties. In fact, the distance itself can be a real test to the real love !!!<br><br>But no doubt the process is gonna be a cruel, sad &amp; torturing one... but if the couple can pass this test of distance. U can imagine how strong their faith in the love is.<br><br>Sad to say... I think not much couples have in fact able to pass this fearful test of love. But ... if theres a will...theres a way !!!!!<br><br>Right here... wishing those who have such experience or in such situation...<br><br>ALL THE BEST !!!!<br>MAY YOUR WISHES CAME TRUE !!!!!<br><br>CHEERIOS !!!!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi shake,<br><br>sorry to hear that yours really didn't work out. not flaming your gf but to send you only  2 postcards within 3 months &amp; only went out with you twice when you were back for the Christmas break, er, that's not very gf-like. just let it go &amp; forget about her, i know it's very easy for me to say &amp; hard for you to do, but what's the point of holding on if she's already interested in someone else? you're still young &amp; in the uk, i'm sure there're lots of available gals, just take this opportunity to meet more people &amp; widen your circle of friends. don't pine for her, it's not worth it (not flaming again), as time passes you'll find that you could have used that time in more productive ways, yeah, i'm speaking from experience - i spent a few years pining for someone &amp; in the end, nothing came out of it except more heartache for myself, so i can tell you pining for someone who doesn't love you is a pure waste of time &amp; sometimes that works against us 'coz we're hoping that the one we love will love us back &amp; we discount all the rest who could've been great potential partners. there'll be someone else out there worthy of your love.<br><br>hang in there &amp; study or work hard. be happy!  &amp; if you're feeling lonesome, you could always post something here, there'll be people to reply to you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i've quite a few friends who are involved in LDR and they do go thru all the bad times...all the threats of breaking up if their bf dun come back for holiday and so on...<br><br>my sister was separated from her husband for 1 year when she went to UK to study and both of them are still alrite...but i guess in their case its different coz they have a commitment to each other as they are already married...they have a responsiblity to remain true to the other person. But for young ppl who is not married or engaged, and if they were to go away, they might not feel obligated to wait for the other person to come back...and i suppose that their hearts are not settled yet...especially for girls who are already working, they meet lots of men everyday and its not difficult to be swayed by temptations.<br><br>------------------<br>tHe BeSt aNd MosT bEaUtiFuL tHinGs iN tHe wOrLd cAnnOt bE sEEn oR tOuChEd. tHeY mUsT bE fELt wItH tHe hEaRt...</div>

I think she appreciate everything you did for her, but jsut that the pain is eating her inside out.  Maybe she doesn't want to end things like this, but she  is feeling so much pain all she can think of is "how to end it?"<br><br>You can't blame anyone when a relationship fails...especially when it's a Long Distance One too...there are times when she needs you to lend her a shoulder to cry on...or times when she needs you to just listen her out, but you can't.  I am sure you also feel those times too rt?<br><br>Love does depends on trust, understand, and the amt of love there is...but LDR is diff...you have to consider the pain involve also...Not saying that it won't work, but too many things in consideration...<br><br>Like Parkie said..."if there's a will...there's way!"
