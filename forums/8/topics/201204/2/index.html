A good example would be Earth, where the dominant species is killing itself and the environment it lives in. It is thus logical to also assume that an intelligent alien species would have caused its own extinction through environmental destruction or by usage of weapons of mass destruction.</div>

Mars once has liquid water that covered a portion of its surface, but dried out over billions of years. Traces can still be found there. What if, buried hundreds of metres below the Martian surface is a vast city network that stretches all across the planet? The Martian Civilisation, destroyed a billion years ago by environmental pollution and weapons of mass destruction, would have been buried by the dust storms that constantly rage across the Red Planet. Unless humans or robots are sent to DIG into the ground, no one would know for sure what lies beneath. Another suggestion would be that humans and some other mammals are actually Martians themselves, whose seeds have been propelled towards its neighbour Earth to preserve the native species of a doomed world.</div>
