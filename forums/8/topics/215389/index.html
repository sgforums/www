            <div class='col-md body'>and on my wedding day, though i was busy and supposed to be happy, my mind would automatically think of alvin, and hoping he would pull thru...and during the dinner, i caught up with those who had visited him, and asked for updates...his head was swollen so bad, they almost couldn't recognise him...<br><br>and then on monday, i flew off for my honeymoon...it was a trip my wife and i looked forward to...we were happily shopping on the streets of hong kong, until i received an sms from another friend..."those who have yet to visit alvin, pls do so asap. doctor say it's not lookind good"...and this "just visited alvin again...asked about his condition, but nurse would not comment..."and more of those until i received a call..."they're pulling the plug off the life support tomorrow nite..."<br><br>my jaw dropped...how could this be? he's only 32! he's my age! memories started flooding my mind...our army days, in taiwan...reservist...and his birthday is just 1 day before mine...and on thursday nite, i received this message "alvin has left us peacefully at 11.25pm"...i had mixed feelings...on one hand, i'm on my honeymoon trip, on the other, i just lost a friend...i was so helpless...i told my friend i couldn't make it to the wake, and asked him to send my deepest condolence on my behalf to his wife...<br><br>if you can read this, Alvin Lee, i know you'd rather be at my wedding than lying there on the hospital bed...I was looking forward to seeing you again, and we were supposed to have fun during our coming incamp...but all these will never happen again...all that i have left are the memories of your laughter and those fotos we took together...Rest In Peace, my brother...</div>

You shouldn't need to have any regrets for not visiting your friend.... I believe your friend would understand your predicament.<br><br>Just enjoy your honeymoon and your married life (don't think your deceased friend would want you to be unhappy on your honeymoon because of him).  Perhaps, when you get back from your honeymoon, try to check on your deceased friend's wife and see if there's anything you can help.  She'll need lots of support during this time.  I believe that's the best thing you can do for your friend.<br><br>Just be sensitive though, as she may want time and space to grieve alone.<br><br>Congratulations on your marriage!  Enjoy your new life together.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
