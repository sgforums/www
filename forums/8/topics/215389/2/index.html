You shouldn't need to have any regrets for not visiting your friend.... I believe your friend would understand your predicament.<br><br>Just enjoy your honeymoon and your married life (don't think your deceased friend would want you to be unhappy on your honeymoon because of him).  Perhaps, when you get back from your honeymoon, try to check on your deceased friend's wife and see if there's anything you can help.  She'll need lots of support during this time.  I believe that's the best thing you can do for your friend.<br><br>Just be sensitive though, as she may want time and space to grieve alone.<br><br>Congratulations on your marriage!  Enjoy your new life together.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div></blockquote>reached home last nite...caught up with a friend, and was told that even my unit CO and S1 attended the wake...(why is it called a wake, when we know that that is something the deceased will never do?)...and it was even more sad was the fact that his youngest son, who is ard 3 yrs old, still doesn't know what has happened...while the rest of the family is mourning, he was still playing ard...perhaps, that is better off for him...he will only realise that his papa is no longer ard when he grows older...and hopefully by then, he will feel less pain...</div>
