            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, good job man...u got a target...now pounce man, pounce!!!  No!!!!!too late she got away....:-)<br><br>no, seriously, the middle man approach is quite good I think, but it can also be quite awkward as u would have to depend on ur friend to help things get moving.  If u talked to her urself, u would have a lower chance of getting to know her, but if u do get to know her, I think that it would be easier for u to talk about things...or maybe that u would feel more confient about it.  Sometimes I find that meeting people thru friends saps a lot of confidence away.<br><br>But whatever u do, u need to talk to her...find out what she likes to do or how she knows this friend or whatever u can come up with....If ur like the rest of us here, that probably means u won't have much to say to her, but try anyway:-)<br><br>I think that that's probably the best advice I could give....not much, and not very insightful...but I hope it adds up with evryone elses posts...:-)<br><br>Good luck.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Definitely not an expert - 4 misses and 1 hit.  If I was expert, it should have been 0 misses and 5 hits.  HAHAHA!<br><br>The one hit I had was actually through a female friend of mine.  So, the middleman idea is not that bad.  It may or may not work - depends on the middleman, like firewire said.  I am lucky 'cos the female friend of mine (middleman/woman) was extremely helpful.  Can't find a better friend than that, I would say!<br><br>This may sounds lame and may scare her away!  If you don't have any ideas, you can try this at your own risk!  Be up front and gutsy but not aggressive!  Just say something like, "I would like to know as a friend, and blahblahblah" - the rest I am sure you know what to say!  Hopefully, she won't be offended or scared.<br><br>Get give any further advice!  But hopes this will help!<br><br>Good Luck!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm... b4 i ans, i have to ask.. did you simply SEE the girl, as in like any normal passerby on the st, or are you actually connected to her in any way???? cos i dont thk there's any pt if you're nv gonna meet her again unless you plan to stake out tt st for the rest of your life............<br><br>if she's a FOAF, org a grp outing or smethg then you can meet her w/o seeming obv. if your fren isnt tt close to her, just squeeze him/her for info..... you can nv get enuff of tt.<br><br>if she's a stranger, but you're still gonna meet her again, the easiest way is to switch on the megawatt smile of yours, go up and ask.... "'scuse me, may i know what time it is?" hopefully she'll be so charmed by your dazzling gd looks she'll deign to cont talking to you. and at least there's smethg to go on frm there...... easiest way. but plssss remm to remove your watch if you're wearing one! or else... doh.<br></div>

She ignores you. LPPL lor, tell yourself that its her loss not to know you, to make yourself feel better hehe.<br><br>2. She laughs at you. Just sigh and walk away, afterall, you dont need to pay anything for saying hi. But I think most girls aint that cruel. If this has too much impact on your ego, hmmm, try saying something nasty and laugh even louder &lt;rofl&gt;. (its up to your creativity to define nasty)<br><br>3. She smiles and introduces herself. Best right? This means she is the nice and friendly girl you are looking for. And the rest is up to you liao.<br>NOTE: If she can be friendly to you, it also means she does the same to anyone else who approaches her...so dont think you are so special and get all excited about it.<br><br>Thats all I can share.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, worm's method is pretty practical and it allows for further conversation. However, if you and she have been working there for some time already, then you might need to modify it a bit.<br><br>Be prepared for the worst, but do not be detered to go for it. Don't be nasty if she rejects you. She might be having a bad day and in that case, you can try again another time - of course don't say the same thing again. Remember, timing is an important factor. Approach her when she is looking happy.<br><br>Depending on the girl, but most of the time, don't use pick-up lines in Singapore. It only works in the movie and maybe more liberal countries.<br><br>Oh yes, another important thing - which I always fail to do - is to remain calm and try not to be excited. Otherwise...<br><br>Ataraxia's way, well, like she said, works for charming guys. And if you want to use it, try not to look stupid, as in the smile is too exaggerated.<br><br>And one last thing, talk is cheap. So, you know what to do.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm, pretty true. my way wld only work if you have a beautiful smile. or you're built like tt hugo boss model. but if you were, you wldnt even have to pick up girls goddamnit!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>i wld advise you to go w worm's way. honestly, i dont thk the "Hi, can I be your fren ?" or "Hi, my name is Qwer, nice to meet you." wld work.. no offence meant guys. but it sounds VERY lame. i mean.... listen to yourselves! the ger wld prolly thk... "who the *&amp;%%&amp; is this guy??!" it's best to strike when she cant run. ie dont just walk up to her on the st. wait for when she's in a lift, waiting in a queue.. where you guys are waiting and thus.. you have an excuse for approaching her.<br><br>gd luck.. hopefully you'll get to know her..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well not much experience here but to add a bit to the expert advices above  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Mabbe u could try making a lil bit of eye contact with her just to drop some subtle hints that you are interested in her?<br><br>Would be better to do that then approach her, at least she'll have some sorta ideal that you are interested and it wouldn't seem so weird for u to approach her  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Why?

            <div class='col-md body'>Just follow your heart<br>I alwayz believe in the chinese saying "Will meet when gather from a thousand mile if fated, since you won't know her even if she is standing next to you". Asking her out is the first move.Go out for a movie or eat kopi lor. Don't go all the way out to impress her. Just be yourself. Call her and chat with her. The drop bits of hint here and there. Or before that, find to find out if she has any feelings for you. If not dropping hints MIGHT worsen the situation!</div>
