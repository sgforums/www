Heeeey....what kind of personal training is your friend looking for huh?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">.  I sometimes provide certain personal training services for too - all for free!  Wouldn't mind training a generous tipper though.<br><br>OK just kidding.....if your friend is interested, I can check with Haiezal if I could pass his number to your friend (out of respect, I need to check with him before giving it out to others....hope you understand, please don't mind).<br><br>Something you wrote which I didn't understand....what is 'Balance', please?<br><br>I've decided not to renew my PF membership after all, but I'll still be there maybe once a week unless I'm overseas.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Pyritenick,<br><br>Sorry, never tried Attack, but I've tried the Muaythai classes at Suntec conducted by Rue, on Fridays at 6:15 pm.  Here are my thoughts....<br><br>PROS<br>- Not too crowded.<br>- Majority female participants <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">.<br>- Suitable for all levels.<br>- Instructress is friendly and able to maintain enthusiasm throughout.<br>- You get to do 30 push-ups at the end, which otherwise most of us will not.<br>- It does make your sweat.<br><br>CONS<br>- There are some cliques in there.<br>- Female participants don't say hi to me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">.  This problem of mine occurs everywhere else too.<br>- Its not even like Muaythai at all.....can't understand where the name came from.<br>- Some flow of movements are awkward...steps don't always flow smoothly into the next.<br>- Personally, I find it very tiring.<br>- Gets a bit monotonous at times due to over-repetition.<br><br>From what I see, the instructress Rue definitely has had some western boxing experience, but not Muaythai.  This shouldn't matter to most as its just the group exercise fun they're after.  But its not the place to pick up basic muaythai skills (I do know there are some who are there for this objective).<br><br>Overall, worth the experience to try lah.  I mean after all, all you need to invest is an hour of your time.<br></div>

No demo aerobics in swimwear?<br><br>Did anyone here participate in the annual PF Mega Combat event some time back?<br></div></blockquote>The good thing about your package is that you can "gym hop" and try different gyms! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Happy New Year to All !!<br><br>Gentlerock ... heard rue spend some years in thailand learning muaythai b4 she starts her career teaching in gyms. well guess that speciality in muaythai puts her higher pay than the other gym lessons eg combat etc. there seems to be 2 terms - one is muayThai and the other is MuaiThai ...i dun know what the difference? I was pretty interested to check out those conducted outside whereby there are sparring lessons and contact kicking n punching. still hesitating cos fitness level not there yet <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>i like the cons that u have stated -  Female participants don't say hi to me . This problem of mine occurs everywhere else too.<br><br>Maybe u can start saying HI to them 1st lor !! everything begins with a simple Hi or SMILEs  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Planet Fitness did their fair bit of roadshow too esp when they 1st launched STC branch. Some of their publicity includes the MegaCombat at the fountain, Instructors involving in national sports events (cant remember which one .. big walk i think).<br>Now they have stop doing roadshows maybe they have secured the amout of memberships to make profits.<br><br>i have been to FF and i must say theirs is the newest gym of all ... impresive pl with all the new equipments but if u just wan to go have a decent workout ... even a $2.50 per entry CC gym will give good results.<br><br>yeah i be working out these weekend ... n relax in the suana or steam bath room.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wahahaha.....someone just asked who our favourite PF gym instructor was and this thread has gone through the roof with its viewership.  Amazing huh?<br><br>I've gone to the office, then to Shenton Way to some stupid Chamber of Commerce (for my work), then went shopping at Bugis, had lunch and now I'm back home.  All before 1 pm too!  How's that for achievement? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Spencer99,<br><br>I'll be working out today and this weekend (I workout almost everyday), but at a gym around where I live.  Think PF will be closed early tonight (eve), so better check first before going.  Even if its opened, I guess the atmosphere will be quite dead 'cos everyone would've gone partying instead.<br><br>Pyritenick,<br><br>I'm no expert, but I'm really in doubt concerning Rue's training in Thailand.  She definitely had some basic training in western boxing + some kind of north Asian TMA (either TKD or Karate)....but really, none of her moves are Muaythai moves leh.<br><br>I guess its common for English spellings to be different, when translated from un-English words.  Its probably just due to individual intepretation of sounds (very subjective), but in the end still refers to the same thing.<br><br>Its a different game altogether...and its more anaerobic than aerobic (typical of boxing and kickboxing).  Sports stamina is quite specific - the only way to improve stamina/endurance for one sport is to do that particular sport itself.  Very seldom is there cross-compatibility (eg. a good runner is not necessarily a good cyclist - reverse is also true).  Having said this, its not realistic for us Singaporeans (if you are one) to have stamina as good as the pros overseas - they undergo very different training from our hobby-type play-play training.<br><br>If martial arts is your interest, then please try it out!  In Singapore, the training level is much easier and there are lots of people who probably have stamina worse than yours.<br><br>Or even worse than mine...hahahaha....which means its really bad <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>I always said that the biggest problem with most sports groups here is that they don't give newcommers the security that they can fit in and feel comfortable - while in reality, this is actually very possible and feasible!  So please don't worry about the stamina and whatever bit...just try it out.<br><br>I feel that the degree of difficulty in picking up such sports is directly proportional to one's age.<br><br>Have you had any martial arts experience before?  If you're really interested, perhaps I could help with some recommendations on schools, contacts, etc.  But you have to tell me exactly what you're after (not "self-defence", I hope...because its a marketing concept which doesn't exist in the real world).<br><br>Peni's,<br><br>A good 2005 to you too!  I'm still wondering....are you really sure at Amore, the members bite each others' t-shirts?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><strong>HAVE A HAPPY 2005, EVERYONE!  </strong><br><br>By the way, I gave 3 bags of clothings and some money to the tsunami victims already.  Have you?  If you can afford to give but don't intend to, shame shame shame on you <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> - may you be extremely horny your whole life but can't find anyone to give it to you!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Twinks,<br><br>I will be doing normal things this weekend.  Workout like there's not tomorrow, eat 6 people's shares per meal, watch TV, sleep, worry about work.  Wanted to get a tan today, but its pouring outside now.<br><br>Er....my turn to ask you....how old is old? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Yes, the outfit at Big Splash is now called BXG Fitness.  Its a small, friendly and cosy kickboxing gym, with membership charges (which includes 10-15 lessons) roughly the same as PF (the last I heard).  Run by two local guys with their wives sometimes helping out on the admin side ('cos the guys are absolutely hopeless when it comes to admin).  Training is as hard as you want it to be.  Website is here <a href="http://www.bxgfitness.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bxgfitness.com</a> (pages may not show fully if your firewall blocks some components).<br><br>Of course if you take it too easy, you're just wasting your time and money lah.  If you're serious about it, however, I think you'll find that the charges are a worthy investment.<br><br>They used to have a Thai guy helping out, but I think he's contract is ending (not sure if they were able to renew it).  Learning from the Thais is good, but for full benefits, you eiuther have to understand Thai, or Thai-English (anyone who've been on shopping trips to Thailand will realise what I mean).<br><br>Anyway, the owner Joe has had fighting competition experience in Thailand and is definitely qualified to teach (he doesn't teach blindly, but also does research to improve his style, etc...and best of all he's the humble type who is quite free with his information).<br><br>(No, I've never taken lessons there, I've just been a bystander who watched the lessons).<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just back from Korean BBQ at Marina Bay where I ate 2 cows, 16 chickens and a few other animals.  On the first day of the year, I've already had my share of fats and cholesterol till end-June 2005 <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">.  Sigh...this also means I have to increase my exercise intensity and duration.<br><br>Sorry, Twinks, it slipped my mind about the identification hint bit (now thats what I call old age bad memory).  For much of the time I'm at PF, I wear black ankle guards.  An ankle hint for another - fair enough! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Anyway, should be easy now to identify me lah.....with the previous hints I've given, I don't think there're many who share the same description.  Er...if you see a young, tall hunk with this description, then its the wrong guy.  hahaha....I'm old, short and frail.<br><br>Actually, there are obviously many gymmers with questions and things to discuss...and who may be interested in meeting other like-minded people.  Perhaps someone could plan a meeting at PF Suntec cafe (or anywhere else) one of these days?  (Sorry, I know I'm pushing the responsibility, but you have to remember that as at today, I'm no long a member of PF and thus lost my event organisation rights <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">).<br><br>What are the usual PF Suntec schedules like for you guys?<br><br>Shucks, I feel like eating nothing but brown bread till end-June.<br></div>
