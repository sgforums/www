My membership is only for Suntec (it ends in two days and I'm still deciding whether to renew it or not....decisions, decisions....).<br><br>At Suntec tonight, I spent some time chatting with Haiezal.  He said its the low season now for personal training (probably the holiday season), so if your friend wants to discuss/consult with him on anything, it may be a good time now (I suppose they do pre-consultation before signing up for personal training - after all, its basic consumer rights to know what you'll be getting before committing).  But please remember that Haiezal works at the SUNTEC branch only.<br><br>He's really a friendly guy...but of course since its a commercial world, I suppose it'd be realistic to expect a little persuasion.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've been moving around non-famous gyms for the past...er...many years.  Yet, I must be out of touch with the scene because I've never heard of FF till recently.  Their marketing not so power is it?<br><br>Never been to California, but heard some complaints about it.  Like overcrowded because they're dropping prices to get volume, that the staff there can be very persistent in getting you to sign up for things, that they even have promotions like freebies to attract people, etc.  Don't know if its all true or exaggerated.<br><br>Marketing and name-wise, California is definitely ahead.  From Singapore to Seoul....they're always in the middle of town, opened 24 hours, big glass panels to allow for transparency, etc.  I remember when California first started up here, they gave free memberships to some celebrities to act as crowd magnets.<br><br>However, I'm still more comfortable with PF Suntec because:<br><br>(1) I had a very very very special offer for it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> (main reason).<br>(2) I know some of the people and staff there.<br>(3) There's some equipment there I use - without it, I won't even join.<br>(4) Car parking seems easier than at California Fitness area....?<br><br>PF Suntec is also one of the very very very few gyms I've joined where the instructors generally do not support cliques (something I extremely hate).  At many other gyms, I found the instructors always mixing around with their regular groups of friends/members only - usually other bodybuilders or ladies who go alone.  The rest of the gym seems invisible to them.  At PF Suntec, much of the time, I don't notice this happening.<br><br>I think its OK to ask for help from the PF instructors too...after all, each of us are paying a bit of their salaries right?  I mean, don't abuse it lah...but if you need a spot or some advice which doesn't take away their livelihood/career, its OK to take a few minutes of their time if they happen to be free.<br><br>Till a few weeks ago, PF had "Floor Trainers" (red tee-shirts) to help out the general crowd who don't subscribe to personal training....but now, they seem to have only "Personal Trainers" (dark blue tees).  I guess maybe as in other profit organisations, the bosses saw "Personal Trainers" as investments....and "Floor Trainers" as costs.  The one fine day at a meeting, they banged on the table with their fists and chanted "blue tees good, red tees bad, blue tees good, red tees bad...." and that spelled the end of help for those who don't go for personal training.<br><br>I suspect that California is starting another branch near the southern part of town to compete with Amore, PF (both of which are already established in that southern area).  For the same reason, PF may perhaps go into town (Orchard area) to compete with California too....though I haven't heard anything yet (till I read one of the posts, a few above this one).<br><br>I've viewed some public gyms too (those at community centres under the "Fit For Life" programme - Fitness Plus is it?).  I've seen two of them - the one at Marine Parade Library and the one at Bedok (next to the Silat Stadium).  I felt that for just keeping fit, they're actually quite in the value-for-money category.  Atmosphere is of course not as nice as the big town gyms....but I wouldn't say that its unpleasant either.<br><br>But for those interested in aerobics, don't join those community centre ones.  Waliow....you see the people and place there, no mood already.  Sorry ah, I'm being a bit cruel... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Honestly, I'd like to get into one of those Amore gyms to see what goes on inside <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">.  Why the steel-wall secrecy?  What are these ladies doing in there which we guys aren't supposed to see and know about???<br></div>
