            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Pyritenick,<br><br>You're a multi-gym user, just like me.<br><br>Yeah....some of the PF Suntec Personal Trainers are quite friendly....dropping by at times for a little chat, inviting me to join them for training, etc.  Some members (strangers to me) also drop by sometimes to say hi.  To be fair, I've come across some not-so-pleasant people too.<br><br>Do you attend Rue's Muaythai class at PF Suntec on Friday evenings?  I went for it twice (I think)....and I think in that class, the participants are almost always the same.  So if you've been there, I may know you by face.<br><br>I don't attend aerobics anymore because I don't find it exhausting enough.  Its probably my own fault because I don't do it hard (instead, I just follow through with the motion and consider the job done).   Don't blame me, its so easy to get distracted <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">.<br><br>Gentlerock</div>

Anyway, registration is available even up to a few minutes before class starts lah.<br><br>I'm quite sure that there are some people who just walk in without registering....and since PF is a commercial entity which relies on its members, they usually will not tell people off (at least I've never seen or heard of this happening before).<br><br>I noticed that the martial arts based classes are the most popular.

            <div class='col-md body'>Spencer99,<br><br>Yeah, I've seen some people doing the back-to-back routine too.  Good grief, don't you guys need to have a drink or go to the loo sometimes?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>On Tenterhooks,<br><br>I was at PF Suntec this evening too.  Initially didn't want to workout today due to a slight injury, but felt bored and decided to go after all.<br><br>I'm not an expert at aerobics, never attended much of it.  But the martial-arts based classes like BodyCombat, Muaythai, seem to be the most popular.  Maybe people like to learn some self-defence (a fallacy which I will keenly argue on...but we'll leave that for another forum).<br><br>Some are more interested in dance-based classes, etc.  Basically, they're all similar in the sense that they all move your whole body and make you sweat/pant a bit.  The only difference is that they are based on different movements (eg. martial arts, dance, etc.) to attract different people.  There are explanations of each type of aerobics at their website <a href="http://www.planetfitness.com.sg/aerobics.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.planetfitness.com.sg/aerobics.html</a>.  You can tell which are the tougher classes by just watching because people in those sweat like tsunami.<br><br>The best advice?  Don't think so much, just try all lah.  Free what! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  Then you'll know what you'll like best.<br><br>The wonderful thing about these classes is that first-timers can fit right in....and need not be hesitant to just walk into any class.  Its a breeze, really.  From what I've seen, there are quite a few first timers in each class.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Twinkie,<br><br>But having been into many gyms is not an indication of how fit I am....rather, its how often I use those gyms and how hard to work while I'm there <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">.<br><br>You know all the machines at Planet Fitness Suntec?  For the entire 2004, I've used only 4-5 machines, total.  Never touched the rest.  Wasteful hor?

I'm almost halfway there already <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Don't know anything about getting boards (what boards were you referring to anyway?).  I usually spend a lot of time around the stretching area at Suntec...and maybe I could be sweet in other ways.  Like maybe help a few members with their stretching or something <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Twinkie,<br><br>Maybe it wasn't a good idea to use her age as a guide.  I was never good at gauging ages after all.  Anyway.....<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"when i say old i mean like u r in yr 60's... unless..."</span><br><br>You overshot by around twice <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">.<br><br>Don't know what to do at the stretching area?  Well, there are quite a few things to do.....eg. stretch, do sit-ups, use the mirror to make sure our hair is in place, tickle the punching bag, etc. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Looks like you don't use the machines much too.  I like using the treadmills upstairs too 'cos they provide nicer views.  But I wish they would clear some space for other activities like skipping, etc.  I do like to switch between running and skipping once in a while - just to have some variation.<br><br>Besides the aerobics instructors, some Personal Trainers like Haikel (the chief instructor) are quite nice and humble too.  This is quite unlike what I've seen at some other gyms, where the instructors put on an attitude.<br><br>Has the spa closed down?  It seemed pretty empty and cleared out last night.<br></div>
