            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, I'm wasting my membership.  Joined the Suntec branch 11 months 3 weeks and didn't use most of the facilities at all.  Tried to go there once a week, but often unsuccessful for all kinds of reasons.<br><br>Till now, I've tried the Muaythai and Body Combat classes about once or twice each, thats all.  Never stepped into any other class.  Always wanted to try Step Aerobics and cycling, etc.  Was watching Step that day from outside (through the glass door)....couldn't even visually follow the first 5 steps (just can't catch how they're moving), so decided not to go in.<br><br>I remember Haley because I attended a Body Combat clinic (beginner's briefing class) which she conducted, which was on a few-to-one basis.  She was quite professional, friendly and encouraging.....the kind of attitude/tone which makes you feel comfortable to join in.  Haley is also a unique name for a local Chinese, so its not hard to remember her.<br><br>Sure, Twinkie, I'll smile next time I see you.  And if you see me smiling at you, please wink sexily at me (if you're female).....or shake my hand (if you're male). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm.... first u need to consider the reason why u sign up for the gym. most of us , its probably to get fit. so focus on that. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>the classes provide a systematic way to attain the goal. doing weights on yr own is no fun...u need guidance for tt. but if u r a guy, u can hang out around the area, there r heaps of guys there n seem to know wats going on. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>try cycle challenge by seng, avoid those who scream out their lungs... i think its a turn off. s u said like haley who explains the moves, is a good trainer .<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>it helps if u have khaki..or smile at a familar face....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Haven't you noticed?  (sgboy2004, better consider carefully <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">).<br><br>Actually, I don't do much weights....more cardio.  I use the treadmill, then do some other cardio stuff, then exercise my mouth abit (ie. chit-chat) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">.  I don't mix around much there...always go alone, just do my stuff and leave.  Used to this routine for many years already.  I exercise in timed cycles most of the time (workout for a few minutes, rest a minute, etc), so I can't really talk anyway.  Its quite a solitary thing...and a little anti-social too.  I use a few other gyms as well, besides PF Suntec.<br><br>Twinkie, when people don't approach you, you say that people are shy and ask people to smile.  When people offer to smile, you say better focus on keeping fit instead.  Sigh.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Talking about screaming, I remember that in this BodyCombat class I attended, there was this guy behind me.  For the first 30 minutes or so, he was quietly following the class like all of us.  Then don't know what suddenly got into him and made him super-gungho.  Without warning, he started shouting..."1!! 2!! 3!! 4!!"...."PUNCH!! PUNCH!! HIAA!! HIAA!!".  Gave me a shock.  Super kia-lang.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey On Tenterhooks,<br><br>There are classes on weekends and after 7 pm on weekdays too.  I'm sure you already have an idea of the schedule, but if you don't you can get it on-line, right here <a href="http://www.planetfitness.com.sg/aerobics_STC.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.planetfitness.com.sg/aerobics_STC.html</a>.  A hardcopy can be found at the PF Suntec main counter.  I believe PF updates these schedules every quarter or so.<br><br>The weekday night and weekend classes can be quite crowded too (but not grossly overcrowded).<br><br>Good luck!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Care Bear,<br><br>The packages at PF are very confusing and it changes each time.  Good news is that I think prices are coming down due to competition.  I think its about slightly more than S$1000 per year now.  But if you join for 3 years at a time, its about S$50+ per month.  My info is probably outdated, so please check with the guys at PF (they are not extremely pushy, so don't worry too much about asking them).<br><br>They used to have a member introduction scheme, but I'm not sure if its still on.  If you look around at their long-outdated website, you may find something <a href="http://www.planetfitness.com.sg" rel="nofollow">http://www.planetfitness.com.sg</a>.<br><br>PF has been giving out a lot of free 7-day trials easily....why not get one and try it out first, just to be sure, before you actually join.<br><br>Nympho,<br><br>I've heard good and bad about both sides (PF and California).  Well, a change of atmosphere might be nice...but hey, I guess you'll be the best person to answer your own question.  Why not get a free 7-day PF trial to see for yourself if it fits you?  Then you can decide from there.....but oh, with a nick like that, I hope you will choose PF! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Twinkie,<br><br>Nah.....I wanted to quit because my membership expires real soon....and I thought I could save some $$ as I have other gyms to use as well (unfortunately, I'm not rich).  PF is the nicest gym I've ever joined, but ultimately, its still a gym at which I don't make full use of.  I'm gonna miss some of the PF people though, some Personal Trainers and members alike, who have been friendly.<br><br>Yes, the screaming does make the class more lively and fun....provided the guy screaming is not just 2 metres behind me!  Actually, I think he may have been 'planted' there by the instructor (it was Haley)....just to help out and bring that part of the hall to life when things were getting a bit monotonous.  Much like a prompter planted in an audience to lead in applause, laughter, etc.<br><br>Ready to go back to work tomorrow, everyone?<br><br>Gentlerock</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by gentlerock:</div><div class="quote_body">Hey On Tenterhooks,<br><br>There are classes on weekends and after 7 pm on weekdays too.  I'm sure you already have an idea of the schedule, but if you don't you can get it on-line, right here <a href="http://www.planetfitness.com.sg/aerobics_STC.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.planetfitness.com.sg/aerobics_STC.html</a>.  A hardcopy can be found at the PF Suntec main counter.  I believe PF updates these schedules every quarter or so.<br><br>The weekday night and weekend classes can be quite crowded too (but not grossly overcrowded).<br><br>Good luck!<br></div></blockquote>thanks for the info, gentlerock.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>guess the good thing is that because ppl who wana attend the class need to register an hr before, hence, there will not be a case of a class being so overcrowded that ppl start to hit each other back to back...which is good!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Care Bear,<br><br>Unlike you, I'm in the office now.  Not all of us get to wallow in fields of roses everyday.  Some of us do have to work for a living. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Hi On Tenterhooks,<br><br>The 1-hour prior registration only applies to the more popular classes.  And I have the feeling that not everyone watches that rule - I mean, no one actually checks when you walk into the aerobics room.  Anyway, registration is available even up to a few minutes before class starts lah.<br><br>I'm quite sure that there are some people who just walk in without registering....and since PF is a commercial entity which relies on its members, they usually will not tell people off (at least I've never seen or heard of this happening before).<br><br>I noticed that the martial arts based classes are the most popular.  Which classes are you interested in?<br><br>Gentlerock</div>

When you scream tonight, please scream "Gen-tle-Rock-rocks!!....Gen-tle-Rock-rocks!!".....so that I can identify you and smile at you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Just kidding...I don't think I'll be at any gym for a day or two.
