            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Â…some psychology??? Note that psychology is never an exact science. It is probably true that 90% of male perform this act one time or another, but how many of these male continue?? Or see the need to continue. Psychology will also explain that being selfish is natural. Unfortunately Christians are not called to be natural, only Godly. </blockquote>Psychology not an exact science ? So is religion a science then ? Why don't u come up with the figures on the people who continue ? Certainly the percentage should be again more than 50%. So chiristian r not natural ? Does tat means they implement un-natural policies ? If the bulk of the population do it, wat does it means ?<br><br>See, your reaction demonstrates again the propensity in which you can misread other peoples comment. I did not specifically state RELIGION, but I mentioned also people with Â“some kind of moral understandingÂ”. I certainly am not stereotyping. At the end of the day, even an unreligious person can have moral values that prevent him from robbing and killing and in the case you'd mentioned, having casual sex with a woman who drops off her dress in front of him.<br><br><strong>Do not mean to offensive here, just an observation that people with some kind of religion or moral understand will not react at a primal level</strong><br><br>Isn't tis stereotyping ? Isn't there religion included in your earlier reply ?<br><br><blockquote>Â… so it does disprove the claim that there is definitely a relief and the removal of stress of wanking off doesnÂ’t it.</blockquote>No, it is still valid and it is said by professionals. I just reaffirm the case where it relief sexual pressure.<br><br><blockquote>Â… and your point is, you have been to all the churches that allow you to make judgements??? That you have suddenly the voice of reason for Christians who feel guilty because they had thought theyÂ’d sin against God. </blockquote>My point is just because u see it as futile doesn't means I should stop at it. Who r u to judge anyway ?<br><br><blockquote>Sure, disagree all you want. But time to walk away. ItÂ’s like you going to a store and become unhappy with the goods and services this store offer and goes back in day in day out to argue with the store owner. The guy will tell to you not to come back anymore. </blockquote>No, it is like a noisy neighbour tat blare his stereo all day. If I can't stand it I have to let him know my stand. So wat r u trying to say, no discussion please ?<br><br><blockquote>Â… so it does go to prove that you are anti-Christian. And stemming from the fact that they go door-to-door to preach their faith. May I ask how often do they come? Daily? Weekly? Monthly? So all you anger comes from the fact that they are bugging you. Boy, you sure can hold a grudge. Hence the conclusion is still, it is really not about asking about rationale, it is really about your pent up anger and frustration and irritation by people who knock at your door.<br>Let the world now judge how irrational you are. In spite of the fact that there are illogical and controversial issues with other religion too, you had chosen to vent your anger at Christianity because of your pent up frustration.<br>Hey, note too that I get peeved when I received in my office email to ask me to contribute money to the seventh month celebration, or when I go to Woodlands interchance, Muslim kids come up to me asking for donations for their mosque. They does not make them my enemy. </blockquote>No, they actually make me read up their bibles and tat make me see the many ridiculous things tat was written in it. BTW do I write nonsense and pure hate mails ? I argue with reasoning and logic. Wat is wrong with it ? Wat is so irational about it ? Tis is one of the many reasons why I do not see eye to eye with christainity. So those who do not see eye to eye with it cannot discuss or comment on it ?<br><br><blockquote>Which is why I really donÂ’t like to quote the internet. It is always prone to be questioned. And as I had predicted, there is no way for you to agree because now I know you are pissed with Christians knocking at your door.</blockquote>I don't why my anger with christian knocking on the door have anything to do with masturbation. I am being frank I do not like christainity but it sure doesn't undermine my right to question about it isn't it ? I wonder how does your exclamation help anyway. I am still going to persists and if u just want to drone on tis fact it just show how little your content is.<br><br><blockquote>errh??? The church owes you an explanation??? The church only owes believers explanation. Since you are already pissed because Christians knocking at your door, there is really no more need to explain anything. Anyway it still goes back to the issue that you can disagree with someone but you can choose to accept their views, which of course you have not. </blockquote>It sure answer the believers if it answer my questioning. If he don't it probably shows it doesn't have a good explanation. As I said before, does tat means they give any cock reasons then I have to accept it ? I cannot ask more ? In the end the whole bulk of your replies doesn't go out to defend the decision but just to undermine me. Why ?<br><br><blockquote>Â…again, your ability to misread stuffs never fail to amaze me!!! Suddenly add in one word: Criminal. Where in the world the word criminal appeared in my previous note?</blockquote><strong>Has any criminal act has been acted out ? As said even from a christian website 95% of population masturbate. So if chain reaction inevitably "occurs", then we expect 95% of the people will be sexual offenders. Wat is the harm ? </strong><br><br>You probably r the one tat read wrongly. I cannot start asking a fresh question ? Did I say, u said about criminal before ? Wat is your definition of sexual offence ? My impression of u is tat masturbation is a sexual offence tat is why it is in the second line. If u fail to read properly then please don't blame the writer.<br><br>Actually I am pretty surprise why u will make a big hoo haa over a christian knocking on my door  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> . So u r targeting the person who ask the question or u r targeting the question ? Does whoever ask the question means anything to u ? There r certainly many other people who do not like christainity due to other reasons, so they r not eligible to ask question or raise doubts ? So u only like to hear comments from people who liek christainity or believers themselves ? It certainly seems u have lose the focus.</div>

When did I say that religion is an exact science. In fact, there is nobody here making that claim. What I don't do is go into forum and knock psychology even though I may not agree with it fully.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">Isn't tis stereotyping ? Isn't there religion included in your earlier reply ?<br></div></blockquote>Wah lau! Of course I said religion, but I also specifically used the word moral that sets apart people who are not religious incline but are highly moralistic. Don't know why you cannot read carefully?<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">No, it is still valid and it is said by professionals. I just reaffirm the case where it relief sexual pressure.<br></div></blockquote>ALL Professionals, or fractions of professionals? Do they all agree? Did they also say that it is harmful if you don't jerk off?<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">My point is just because u see it as futile doesn't means I should stop at it. Who r u to judge anyway ?<br></div></blockquote>Actually moderator tell you to stop.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">No, it is like a noisy neighbour tat blare his stereo all day. If I can't stand it I have to let him know my stand. So wat r u trying to say, no discussion please ?<br></div></blockquote>No the illustration is flawed, a noisy neighbour has NOISE reaching you. Forum? You don't have to come in if you do not agree with what is written. You don't see me going into Bar very often, and if I do I'd try to respect the other forumites. You have become THE NOISY NEIGHBOUR BY EXACTING REVENGE, NOT AT YOUR NEIGHBOUR, BUT AT YOUR <strong>NEIGHBOURHOOD</strong>. Not happy with people that knocks at your door, tell them off, leave the Christians (and the Catholics) here alone.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">No, they actually make me read up their bibles and tat make me see the many ridiculous things tat was written in it.

So those who do not see eye to eye with it cannot discuss or comment on it ?<br></div></blockquote>You mean after all your ranting, you are incapable of saying NO? Must be compelled to sit down to listen ar?<br>You assume you argue with reason and logic. Fine with me. Don't see eye to eye with Christians. OK too. You OK with Nezha, Kuan Gong, 8 Fairies, burning paper buildings during Cheng Meng??? Spend some time on these topics. So the issue is still YOU DO NOT LIKE CHRISTIANITY, WHICH HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH LOGIC OR REASONING.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">I don't why my anger with christian knocking on the door have anything to do with masturbation.

I am still going to persists and if u just want to drone on tis fact it just show how little your content is.<br></div></blockquote>It is not about masturbation anymore. In all your postings you have relentless targetted Christianity and you have admitted you deep (hate?) towards this religion. So everything else no longer is important. Everything you say will have an extremely prejudiced twist to it and any argument forthcoming from you becomes pointless.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">It sure answer the believers if it answer my questioning. If he don't it probably shows it doesn't have a good explanation. As I said before, does tat means they give any cock reasons then I have to accept it ? I cannot ask more ? In the end the whole bulk of your replies doesn't go out to defend the decision but just to undermine me. Why ?<br></div></blockquote>For a simple reason that your objective is not to SEEK, but to CONFRONT. You may still be in a state of denial on this, but anyone reading your notes will see the confrontation tone that you have been using.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">You probably r the one tat read wrongly. I cannot start asking a fresh question ? Did I say, u said about criminal before ? Wat is your definition of sexual offence ? My impression of u is tat masturbation is a sexual offence tat is why it is in the second line. If u fail to read properly then please don't blame the writer.<br></div></blockquote>Sure you can ask a fresh question, but the context of the paragraph is a continuation of the previous question. You may have worded the question different IF your intention is to ask another question. As you had said (grammar mistakes and all) "My impression of u is tat masturbation is a sexual offence tat is why it is in the second line"<br>You had already formed an impression that I said masturbation is a sexual offence, so whatever....<br>Well, if you still insist that I have misread you, I apologise. Please bear in mind that in communication, while it is important to interpret correct, it is equally important to express one self correctly too.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">Actually I am pretty surprise why u will make a big hoo haa over a christian knocking on my door  . So u r targeting the person who ask the question or u r targeting the question ? Does whoever ask the question means anything to u ?

So u only like to hear comments from people who liek christainity or believers themselves ? It certainly seems u have lose the focus.<br></div></blockquote>I did not make a big hoohaa about a Christian knocking on my door. You said it. You also said that too bad the Roman Catholics are seen by you as Christians so they get knocked too. Your words, not mine.<br>Obviously there are other people who dislike Christianity and they too have the freedom to ask. The issue is you do not ASK, you CONFRONT. Maybe it is due to the tone of your notes. May I then suggest that you take up a course in better the command of the English language as well as to learn how to write properly.<br>Since you are such a fan of psychology, let me say that reading a note in a forum such as this is influenced by tone, grammar, emphasised in certain words, as well as the style.<br>So it is entirely possible that you are innocent of all the things I'd said about you. For that I offer you an apology. My advise to you is please use a friendlier tone. As you had admitted in our previous confrontation in another thread, you said that you come in guns ablazing. Why the need to come in in such a mode? I am sure most of the other forumites do not write like you.<br><br>Should you now then obey the moderator and stop this thread?<br>Note to Mod. I did not start this, but I am fully aware that Mr Stupidissmart WILL DO THIS SEQUEL. It is in his nature.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>You damn dense or what? When did I say that religion is an exact science. In fact, there is nobody here making that claim. What I don't do is go into forum and knock psychology even though I may not agree with it fully. </blockquote>Do u know wat is being sarcastic ? Asking u on whether religion is a science is being sarcastic. Why I ask tat question ? It is because someone actually ask whether is psychologist a science or not. WHo is the one knocking psychology just because u do nto agree with wat they say about masturbation ?<br><br><blockquote>ALL Professionals, or fractions of professionals? Do they all agree? Did they also say that it is harmful if you don't jerk off? </blockquote>Most of them appears to have little problem with masturbation. It seems tat only the very religious r claiming it is harmful.<br><br>No the illustration is flawed, a noisy neighbour has NOISE reaching you. Forum? You don't have to come in if you do not agree with what is written. You don't see me going into Bar very often, and if I do I'd try to respect the other forumites. You have become THE NOISY NEIGHBOUR BY EXACTING REVENGE, NOT AT YOUR NEIGHBOUR, BUT AT YOUR NEIGHBOURHOOD. Not happy with people that knocks at your door, tell them off, leave the Christians (and the Catholics) here alone.<br><br>They have certainly pose some "noise" by going aroudn asking people to convert. I am sure some of the forumers do experience tis.<br><br>Wat about your analogy about going to a store and continuous complain ? Tis is a forum for goodness sake, a place where people express their feelings and opinions. If by going to your analogy of "store keeper", then probably no one can write anything in the forums as they r often complains or grouses itself. Maybe no one should write in speaker corner and complain about gov then.<br><br><blockquote>You mean after all your ranting, you are incapable of saying NO? Must be compelled to sit down to listen ar?<br>You assume you argue with reason and logic. Fine with me. Don't see eye to eye with Christians. OK too. You OK with Nezha, Kuan Gong, 8 Fairies, burning paper buildings during Cheng Meng??? Spend some time on these topics. So the issue is still YOU DO NOT LIKE CHRISTIANITY, WHICH HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH LOGIC OR REASONING. </blockquote>I am not okie with nezha, kuan gong etc. But at least IMO they requires little commitment. They do not have to pray everyday or go to church every sunday. They only need to pray when they r in trouble which I feel is a plus point.<br><br>Why pull other religion into it ? U want to pull, do it yourself. If I feel strongly about it maybe I can write a line or 2 about it.<br><br><blockquote>It is not about masturbation anymore. In all your postings you have relentless targetted Christianity and you have admitted you deep (hate?) towards this religion. So everything else no longer is important. Everything you say will have an extremely prejudiced twist to it and any argument forthcoming from you becomes pointless. </blockquote>Why will tat be ? It seems tat u want to find a shortcut out by just mentioning about my preference of christainity. Using the example of Gov again, should they only heed the advice of those who support all their action or should they put up a listening ear to the views from the people who raise issues tat was against their policies. Why censor yourself off from valuable feedback ?<br><br><blockquote>For a simple reason that your objective is not to SEEK, but to CONFRONT. You may still be in a state of denial on this, but anyone reading your notes will see the confrontation tone that you have been using. </blockquote>The problem is I do not just go around writing rubbish or insults or anything. If my preference of christainity means anything it just means I am keeping an eye on finding the weak spots of it. Why fear opposition ? Surely all religion have a fair amount of people tat dislike it.<br><br><blockquote>Sure you can ask a fresh question, but the context of the paragraph is a continuation of the previous question. You may have worded the question different IF your intention is to ask another question. As you had said (grammar mistakes and all) "My impression of u is tat masturbation is a sexual offence tat is why it is in the second line"<br>You had already formed an impression that I said masturbation is a sexual offence, so whatever....<br>Well, if you still insist that I have misread you, I apologise. Please bear in mind that in communication, while it is important to interpret correct, it is equally important to express one self correctly too. </blockquote>If I express myself wrongly then I will apologise. But too bad it seems tat u r not answering any questions I post about masturbation now. U seems to focus on me myself.<br><br><blockquote>I did not make a big hoohaa about a Christian knocking on my door. You said it. You also said that too bad the Roman Catholics are seen by you as Christians so they get knocked too. Your words, not mine. </blockquote>I said tat but who is the loudspeaker who claims tat he do not reply to my questions just because a christian knock on my door ?<br><br><blockquote>Obviously there are other people who dislike Christianity and they too have the freedom to ask. The issue is you do not ASK, you CONFRONT. Maybe it is due to the tone of your notes. May I then suggest that you take up a course in better the command of the English language as well as to learn how to write properly. Since you are such a fan of psychology, let me say that reading a note in a forum such as this is influenced by tone, grammar, emphasised in certain words, as well as the style.<br>So it is entirely possible that you are innocent of all the things I'd said about you. For that I offer you an apology. My advise to you is please use a friendlier tone. As you had admitted in our previous confrontation in another thread, you said that you come in guns ablazing. Why the need to come in in such a mode? I am sure most of the other forumites do not write like you. </blockquote>People have different styles of writing. Some people like to use a lot of smileys, some people like to add a lot of cute words, some people like to use a lot acronyms. Is true tat I am not in my most friendly tone but too bad during for most of my posts I always maintain tis tone, be it about homo or politics watever. I do not purposely write "unfriendly" towards christainity but it is just my style of writing.<br><br><blockquote>Should you now then obey the moderator and stop this thread?<br>Note to Mod. I did not start this, but I am fully aware that Mr Stupidissmart WILL DO THIS SEQUEL. It is in his nature.<br></blockquote>Why stop tis thread ? I do not really understand it. If u don't like to read then don't. If u find the para too long then don't read. It is true. If this thread is stop it just means there will be a sequel 3 &amp; 4 and to infinity if tat is required. If I get banned there may even be stupidissmart2 or stupidissmart3 etc. I don't understand why should it be stop.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Christians believe masturbation is a sin against chastity. Sex is exclusively a marital act for procreation and the sharing of love between a man and woman who are wedded together. To masturbate is to bypass the act of love between a married couple and the act of procreation. A simpler explanation? Any sexual act out of marriage is a sin. This may be a bit hard to accept.</div>
