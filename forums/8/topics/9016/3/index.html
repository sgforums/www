            <div class='col-md body'>Most gals or in natural fact, ALL GALs in particular i have known, all seem to be so devoted to the guys they have really fallen in love with!<br><br>I know its tough to forget someone, and considering the huge long amount of time u and him have been together, its very very hard for u to forget him easily. Even when everyone may say that time might heal all wounds, a number of my friends have gone through such bad patches before and it's indeed a long long time before they could ever bear to let go the guy they have once loved for ages!<br><br>Even when everyone seem to say that he's not the only one in this world, it would take a considerable amount of time before u can accept another guy too!<br><br>Trust me, u have totally lost hope, faith and trust in him. Its high time to break up with him before u start regretin for the rest of yr life. That would be even worse! Imagine the seneario of u suffering everyday in misery togther with him.<br><br>Bascially, if u tell the fact to yr parents, they would definitely agree to what u want. All parents love their own kids and want the best for their sons or daughters. Therefore, if yr parents know the whole situation, I bet you that they would demand an apology from him and be by your side all the way...<br><br>Don't worry and do what's best. Please do not think the time u have spent together with him is wasted, but think it in a way that u ONCE had happy memories together with him BUT you both are simply not fated to be together!<br><br>All the best!<br>U've got my encouragement!<br><br>CHeerioZ! :Ã¾<br></div>

At least your effort has paid off   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">.At least now you know that he really loves you, if not he wouldn't bother to change for you. I hope the both of you *bai tou sei lao, yong yu ai he*.<br><br>------------------<br>The  greatest regrets in our lives are the risks we did not take. If you<br>think  something will make you happy, go for it. Remember that we pass this way only  once.<br>Bottomline :<br>Time don't wait. If you think you might have found the  right one, treasure him/her. Don't let he/she go away. Don't let fear hold you  back.<br>Give it a try else you might regret later... No one other than  yourself<br>knows what can truly make you  happy.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Ashley (edited 04 April 2002).]</div>
