            <div class='col-md body'>hi all!!<br><br>I had a boyfriend whom I am going to get ROM with him on this coming 22 Jan 2002.<br><br>Recently, he had changed a lot. He is not the guy that I used to know - He is caring, loving and attentive in the past. Now he had become a complete stranger to me.<br><br>I am working in west side but I am staying in the central. My new job provide me with lodging near my working place. Yet at that time my boyfriend feels that I should stay in his home because it is near my working place too.<br><br>I had rented a car for his convenience purpose to send me there ( abt 5 mins drive ) because I had to be there very early. I am paying the petrol, rental and even the season parking. In the first place he is the one who offers to send and later he changed...<br><br>He likes to play lan game and often forget about his time on it. I, as a girlfriend cares abt him and had remind him that he had to work the next day. He flares at me and said that I had been controlling his life and I am restricting him and confine his freedom. I mean, I did not asked him to STOP AND GET BACK TO SLEEP. I just care for him. All he cares is about his lan gaming. I feel that I am like a puppet.<br><br>For the past 2 months plus I had been working, I am very stress too. I had been chase out by him for 4 times. He uses a lot of excuse and in the end, he told me that he had lost his freedom and lifestyle. I did not stop him from doing his things...<br><br>I am tired of givinh in at all time and last night I suicide , try to end my life. But failed. I feel that I am a lunatic as my mind is unsound already.<br><br>Today, he told me he had lost interest in me and he wanted to postpone the ROM matter. How am I going to face my parents and at the same time, I also wondering if I should marry him.<br><br>I love the guy who is in the past and I had put in a lot of effort and time for this relationship. Yet in the end he did this to me. I was almost mad just now... I shouted at him loudly which I had never done in my life before.<br><br>Tell me what should i do??? I am desperate</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>how long have you know each other? dont commit sucide, it is not worth doing it, btw, does he know?<br><br>my friend...look to me either the guy has changed or he has someone on his mind, or he is trying to find excuse to dump you...what a guy and so near your ROM. And to chase you out 4 times...my god<br><br>Maybe both of you should talk properly, try to ask him why he is acting this way, if you can't do it this way, write him a letter and ask him to reply in a letter. Ask him to tell you the truth, if really it is a small problem, then maybe both of you can try to change...give and take<br><br>If he try to find excuses, maybe then you must let him go, it is not good for a forced relationship. Remember, it is him who don't want you, not you...<br><br>death is not the solution, and dying for a man who doesn't love you is not worthy...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hm.. u heard it from his own mouth, he said he wasn't interested anymore. Perhaps you should stop deceiving yourself and tell yourself to buck up and rid yourself of the leech.<br><br>I don't mean to sound harsh, but if you look back, you would have realise that he took you for granted, living of you etc. You have to see and recognise it for yourself.<br><br>Don't give yourself the impression that you are trying or can change him for the better. Don't fall into this trap.<br><br>Right now the best thing for you is to bring the issue up, and thrash it out. If he does not want to, seek refuge in your parents or talk to his parents.<br><br>Don't treat yourself that way. I understand that you feel hurt and deceived, you feel pain that loving someone for so long and he ended up doing such a thing. Try this. Think of all the examples of him being mistreating you, think of everything bad that he has done.. and ask yourself one thing..<br><br><strong>Is it worth it?</strong><br><br>Love may be sacrificing for someone else.

I am desperate</div></blockquote>The main question is to ask yourself hor..that the main reason that yuo are still clinging on to this relationship..is it because that you still love him deep insdie your heat?? or is it that just because you dun know how to face your parents regarding this issue?<br>Actually if you really want to end this relationship but afraid of facing your parents...i can tell you this for sure..you shouldn't be afraid to inform them..coz which parents will want their own daughter to be married to someone like him?? though they may sound surprised..but i'm sure that they will support your decision..<br>but if you still oove him deeply..maybe as what obiwan has said...talk to him and see whats the problem between you 2...if its really that he dun have anymore feelings for you..then i guess you just have to swallow the pain and leave him..no point holding on to someone that has already lost his feelings for you rite ( you will not be happy even if you carry on..trust me..)...theres always someone out there who really cares for you..maybe its just that the time for both of you to meet is still not rite yet...leave him alone for a few days before asking him out to have a talk with him..let him hknow the feeling of living without you..maybe its just that sometimes looking at each other for too long also have its negative impact...<br>Go out and enjoy life without him for a while with your Galfriends or a mixed groups...do things that you have ever wanted to do but he has always disagreed to..and dop not think too much abt this issue first...maybe for all you know...being unable to end this relationship is because its already a habit for you to be with him..go out..open your circle of friends and meet more people..the more you think..the worse you feel..<br>And for the last issue...remember..you life was given to you by your parents...it is a gift from them...you can't just take it away from them all because if someone that has no more feelings for you...do you think that its worth it?? Suicide is never a way out..never was..and never will be...just think abt it...<br>Hope this will help you...all the best and good luck..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Hmm, do people really change during a course of a relationship? In anycase, you realized that he only changed once you guys went to ROM. I guess when you have realized your relationship has taken another level, you start thinking about it more, and probably start looking at the bad points of your BF.<br><br>Look, no one is perfect in life. "Oh, he's got soo much airs about himself" or "Man, if only she could think"... Little things that couples fail to realize during the beginning of a relationship, that's because during that period, it's all about loving him/her.<br><br>Devilgal, try to remember why you love him, and weigh up your options. Marraige isn't an easy decision to make, and definately not one that you make in haste. Weigh your options, and see what your pros and cons are. IF your love out-weighs the problems that he has, go for it.... It's not too late to back out either...Think about it wisely, while you have the time. Once you decide to step into marraige, it's really hard to turn back.<br><br>I wish you all the best in whatever you decide, and in no case should you ever think about ending your life. YOUR life is precious, remember that. Think about what else you can do in life...<br><br>Regards...</div>

He had promised me he would not be like this in future and the reason y he had become like this is because he was stress under his work.
