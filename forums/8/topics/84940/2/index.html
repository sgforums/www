In case you don't know, we earned more than 300 million dollars from China tourists last year. Even countries like America, Greece and Japan are eagerly trying to woo China tourists.

They are fast becoming a menace to society especially with their presence right at our doorsteps now.<br><br><strong>Main Story</strong><br>My gf was waiting for a cab in the evening after having her hair done at a salon nearby in siglap. Dressed in a sleeveless top and 3/4 quads. To me this doesnt give anyone the wrong impression.<br><br>while waiting, a van with 3 Caucasians stopped right infront of her, a burly guy opened the sliding door and asked her to get in, terrified by gf shaked her head and walked backwards. after repeat attempts by the 3 guys they finally gave up and drove off.<br><br>Thankfully the road was very busy and there were many curious onlookers. Suffice to say my gf was scared stiff and hurried home to recount to me the story. when I heard it, images of "BangBus" came to my mind, and I was relieved my gf was alrite.<br><br>Most probably the ang mohs tot that my gf was a street walker, no thanks to those China WuYa-s...Anyone had similar encounters to throw in for discussion?<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Gf?
