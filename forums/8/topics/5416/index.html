            <div class='col-md body'>I think that thread is getting out of hand. I am a neutral observer and thus maybe could provide a impartial conclusion. I think we should view this matter from the individuals' point of perspective.<br><br>Jackchen doubts the site uses in excess of 60GB. Truthfully, I have my doubts too. It does seem a trifle too much. His suspicions aren't totally unfounded. But I wouldn't go as far as to make such accusations and brand chief a liar. Cos I've got no solid evidence to back up my claim. Maybe they really do use up 60GB of bandwidth. Maybe it's really THAT popular. Or maybe they isn't. My point is, if I ain't sure of it, I wouldn't accuse chief of doing so and give him the benefit of the doubt. But I think Jackchen had good intentions when he pointed it out. Because the possibility exist. The intention was good but the means of expression was rather reckless.<br><br>Chief, if you're really using up 60GB of traffic, I suggest you should really consider changing your host. Yeah your right, there's no such thing as unlimited bandwidth, but for US$200? I am<br>vey sure there are better options.<br>As mentioned previously check out <a href="http://www.hostindex.com" rel="nofollow">www.hostindex.com</a>  They've got tonnes of paid host there.<br><br>What was most disappointing regarding the whole matter was the vulgar exchanges and demeaning comments. Who cares who started it or whatever. Cos whoever started the vulgarities shouldn't have done so. And whoever reacted to the vulgarities shouldn't have done so either.<br>Two wrongs doesn't make a right. Reacting to the vulgarites just means degrading oneself to his level. And this applies to the 3rd parties involved.<br><br>Please do not try flaming me cos I don't react to flames. Actually, I do react, but I do it with a smile:-) . Or maybe I won't even bother.<br><br>If at any point of the post, even though I've been really careful, I have unintentionally offended anyone, please accept my apologies beforehand.<br><br>///////////<br>Black cat or white cat, as long as it catches the rats, its a good cat.<br><br>Chio gal or ugly gal, as long as she's a kind gal, she's a good gal.<br>//////////</div>
