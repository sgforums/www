            <div class='col-md body'>Just out of malice I stab him yet another time, the knife goes into his abdomen without much resistance.  I think it's normal that people may be curious about this thing, you don't get to slash people up, stab them and not worry about the mess every day.  So I turn the blade around and blood flows even stronger, some of it ends up on my face.  I snuck my tongue to the corner of the lips and taste it, salty, iron-ish, thick.<br><br>Well, now the hard part.  I think I should be original and cut in assymetric geometric shapes.  God knows most probably I won't get to do this ever again.  However I notice the bones and realize that unless I employ a saw, I have to cut on the joints like a layman would.  By this time my whole body is drenched in his blood.  Call this a bloodlust but I have stopped caring for anything, only this arduous task waiting for me to complete it.  Finally I make a decision.<br><br>I place the knife as if shaving him.  With a long stroke a layer of skin and sinew peels off and I can see the red, raw muscles.  I keep doing that and finally I get to the bones and tendons.  Once I see them I separate them at the join.  Off goes the left forearm, done!<br><br>I work the right arm the same way, every once in a while I slice off a part of his face: nose, ears, the holes that you don't get to touch usually.  It is late now, the blood floods the floor.  There is gore everywhere, his children won't be able to recognize him and maybe they should not see this...this...rapist (stab!) married with children goddamn (stab) rapist (stab) I fucking hate him.<br><br>erm, wat to do next, ah?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Part 3:<br><br><strong>Next comes the hardest part... will he taste better steamed, grilled and roasted? Or frying be a yummy idea?<br><br>As I was deciding, I took out all the new utensils I have specially bought to cook him. How should I do it to make him more tasty?<br><br>AH HA~<br><br>I begin to hack the rest of his body into lotsa little pieces... I will do a little bit of each then. Let them try it out~!<br><br>Still got 2 hours more before my hungry guests arrive to dispose of his body for me. Have to be quick... I sped up and made sure that no part was spared, innards included.<br><br>As I caught whiffs of his burning flesh, how heavenly they seemed~<br><br>I waited for the big moment to arrive...<br><br>At seven sharp, all of them begin to trickle in. They could smell him and they were getting all excited. The chitter chatter were complimenting the cooking and boiling of his meat. I was exhilarated.<br><br>They all sat down and waited eagerly with their gleaming silver. I bought those just for today, they told me that they have never seen such nice cutlery. I mentioned that they will love it better when they use those razor sharp knives on my masterpiece.<br><br>Amazingly, at Â¼ past eight, all of them already finished everything, they loved every piece of him. I cleared the table while listening to their after-dinner trivia.<br><br>I firmly insisted on not letting them into the kitchen, it's a REAL mess... I smiled.<br><br>When I closed the kitchen door again, they asked me where was my husband? It's way past nine now... I said I wasn't sure, he hasn't called back to inform me of anything and I was glad that he was not around to blunder up.<br><br>When they left around ten plus... someone advised me to call him just in case something happened, I declined and indicated my fatigue. Said our goodbyes and I closed the main door behind me.<br><br>WOAH~<br><br>What a day...</strong><br><br>------------------<br>You are poison... poison running through my veins...<br><br>Poison...
