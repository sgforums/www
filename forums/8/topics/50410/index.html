            <div class='col-md body'>LOL  spoken like a true sufferer of public sector bureucracy.  Use this to your advantage.  Upon getting any summonses/fine, if you think you've got a case, write in an appeal (any appeal will do).  Especially for traffic offences.  They'll take ages to process and verify.  In the meantime, even if the fine is not waived, you can postpone paying by 2 months!<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by kopiosatu:</div><div class="quote_body">its not damn slow, its TAMADE NBCB KNN F*CKING SLOW</div></blockquote></div>
