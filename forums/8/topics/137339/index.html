            <div class='col-md body'>Spending a large portion of my life behind kitchen had made me look shabby, ugly and unattractive..

My friend once told me that people who are handsome or pretty have more opportunities in life and are more well-like by business associates..<br><br>From that day onwards, I strive to be a hunk.. being young, I don't want to deprive myself of any opportunity if I am ever presented one.. I want to look the best, couple with my talent and ability, there will be lesser chance of them saying no to me..<br><br>I starts running 5km everyday, do 150 push-up, 200 sit-up and 20+ chin-up was always a breeze..<br><br>Soon I became a regular to this particular gym and was always attracting many unwanted tasteless advance.. As days goes by, my body starts to develop into shapes and couple with tones, you could say I look like pierre png or bread pig..<br><br>It was only time before talent scout hit upon me, asking me to be their pin-up boy for their agency.. the money they offered was good but it was not in my agenda to become an international model.. Of course I am flattered if you asked me..<br><br>Today, I spots a six-pack, a broad shoulder that spans across the horizon and a look that you will normally die for.. I look stronger than before and it also renew the confidence in me.. I had numerous requests to be a movie star which I rejected and thank them for their kind offer as I rather concentrate on doing my business well which I have more interest in.. Its easy to be a hunk and I encourage everyone here to give it a try and yes I still run 5km, do 150 push-up, 200 sit-up and 20+ chin-up daily..<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by caramon.:</div><div class="quote_body">Spending a large portion of my life behind kitchen had made me look shabby, ugly and unattractive.. I used to be on the plump side and spots a pot-belly due to my excessive drinkings.. My friend once told me that people who are handsome or pretty have more opportunities in life and are more well-like by business associates..<br><br>From that day onwards, I strive to be a hunk.. being young, I don't want to deprive myself of any opportunity if I am ever presented one.. I want to look the best, couple with my talent and ability, there will be lesser chance of them saying no to me..<br><br>I starts running 5km everyday, do 150 push-up, 200 sit-up and 20+ chin-up was always a breeze..<br><br>Soon I became a regular to this particular gym and was always attracting many unwanted tasteless advance.. As days goes by, my body starts to develop into shapes and couple with tones, you could say I look like pierre png or bread pig..<br><br>It was only time before talent scout hit upon me, asking me to be their pin-up boy for their agency.. the money they offered was good but it was not in my agenda to become an international model.. Of course I am flattered if you asked me..<br><br>Today, I spots a six-pack, a broad shoulder that spans across the horizon and a look that you will normally die for.. I look stronger than before and it also renew the confidence in me.. I had numerous requests to be a movie star which I rejected and thank them for their kind offer as I rather concentrate on doing my business well which I have more interest in.. Its easy to be a hunk and I encourage everyone here to give it a try and yes I still run 5km, do 150 push-up, 200 sit-up and 20+ chin-up daily..<br></div></blockquote>and after reading tis, we supposed to go: "wah, my hero!!!!!!!~" ???  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This reminds me of a new paper article I read during the weekend on guys/paedophiles asking schoolgirls out for sex via irc. One reporter disguised herself as a schoolgirl and waited for the guy to turn up while the rest of her team armed with cameras hid nearby. Sure enough, the guy showed up. The self proclaimed"good looking guy who wears only branded clothes" turned out to be a short skiny bespectacled geek wearing cheapo polo shirt and pants. I think caramon belongs to the same group.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
