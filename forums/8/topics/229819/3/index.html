And being shy and introvert has no place in this world - you have to be outspoken, and this is a necessity, not an option. And hence, RP PBL approach trains one to be outspoken and communicative - because we have to present everyday.<br><br>To tell you the truth, the world is unfair, live with it. No matter how smart you are, if you aren't able to effectively convey out your thoughts, your ideas can never materialize into brilliant works.<br><br>And that is why we in RP/SMU is better in this area, we are trained to be more outspoken - and our learning environment simulate that in the working society.<br><br>I don't care what people think about RP - lousy, dumping ground, whatever...most of those people aren't really great in life to accuse us also. What matters is yourself and how you shape your destiny. Anywhere you go also the same, if you do well, you will succeed. If the society requires you to be outspoken to succeed, and if you conform, of course you will succeed.<br><br>Nothing is fair, doesn't mean you can't work around it. (=<br>Go RP! Go SMU!

If the COP is higher of course people will use it as last resort and because of that naturally it will be given the title as 'Dumping ground' by others who can get into a lower COP poly.<br>I don't think RP is a dumping ground to me or to anyone, i prefer to call it 'The final hope', no one would really want to go ITE then after that go poly then if successful go uni... hello? how old will u be by then? 30? near 40?

HaLLO?!....................republicpolymaindesk!"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  In response to my enquiry, she gave me a number that turned out to be a fax number.. rang her again and she gave me another number, which also turned out to be a fax number... I did finally get a hold of the lecturer, via his hp.. he was so paiseh that he came down to pick the parcel up instead. =.=<br><br>I mused over this incident at the end of the day and thought "poor students" .... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
