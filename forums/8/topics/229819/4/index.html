            <div class='col-md body'>RP - to some other meanings<br><br>Rubbish Poly<br><br>Retarded Poly<br><br>to some they may feel this way.<br><br>although i'm a poly student too. but it's in the passed. mayi used to be my classmate..haha..she's a really hardworking classmate to be with.<br><br>but like she said being introvert in RP will not be good.<br><br>now for the clarification part of some misconceptions of RP.<br><br>now, the value of RP diploma isn't very good - to be honestly speaking.<br><br>but there's a trick to it.<br><br>if you want your <span style="color: green;">RP diploma to be very valuable</span>- winning other peers in other poly CAN - Provided you regularly join those competitions orgarnised in RP and emerged Top, get testimonial from the competitions or photographs, inculde them into your resume.<br><br>why competition is good for increasing you worth - in the working society - if you have 1st hand experience and won awards, even if you request for a higher pay compared to your peers, you are worthy of the higher pay-check<br><br>quality = $ = higher salary<br><br>RP definately isn't recommended for those book worms.<br>why is that so?<br>1- no books for studying (so for those from elite schools, they might not be able to blend into RP; i've got a friend who happens to drop rp after 1st yr[1st sem] than now he's in jc yr 2 already.)<br><br>2- even if have, last min, when problems are published every morning than you only are left with 30mins to chiong to library (rp outsourced it to NLB to do the job) so it has a very wide variety of books for students to choose from.<br><br>3- problems are to be solved within a short period of time, so it's more suitable for those people who think faster and can related to other examples.<br><br>4- presentation<br>presentation is to be done on a daily basis.<br>1 very crucial factor that is needed for general working life in office environment and others as well.<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">persentation is about presenting WHAT YOUR KNOW, HIDE YOUR WEAKNESSES, BRING OUT YOUR STRONG POINTS.</span> the same goes to job interview. you can only speak the good stuffs and hide the bad stuff.<br><br>how to hide your own weaknesses will be another issue - dealing with team work, to help you mask your weak point. Co-ordination is also an important point to take note if you want to successfully hide the weakness (of not knowing how to answer) from the facilitator.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">overall RP is good - as in classroom, and to link to presentation.<br>it's also very relervent to working life.</span><br><br>Imagine - you are very hardworking in preparing the slides for presentation BUT you can't sell yourself (bring the idea across to facilitator during presentation) so you don't score.<br><br>some eat-snake kings &amp; queens in different classes might be lazy but they are able to get A* most of the time because they carry themselves well.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: blue;">Work life - is about team work and presentation</span></span>, if a person can't even do well in this 2 things, than there's no point in working in office environment.<br><br><span style="color: red;">1 particular important lesson which is very valuable to me is that, from RP, i get to learn how to actually prevent your own work from being used by other people (very often people will claim credits for other's people work) </span><br><br>RP is a good training ground to improve in terms of this aspect.<br><br>As for improving presentation skills.<br>if you ask the right person, then you will get to improve your presentation skills.<br>Doing the same thing everyday without improving and repeating the same mistakes very day definately will not have improvments.<br><br>The idea of Presentation is to observe each other classmates' presentation style and try to copy and make their's your own style.<br><br>But often, when it's presentation time, many other different groups will be playing games silently instead of really listening to the presentation. (especially in the woodlands campus) back in the tanglin campus, at least the silent gaming session during presentation isn't that serious due to tight space. lolz.</div>
