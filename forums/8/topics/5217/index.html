            <div class='col-md body'>hey araven,<br>Just wondering, what do you mean by "mess around with you and toss you aside"?<br><br>The bit about "giving a simple thanks", i feel that that should suffice, i mean what do you expect? A medal? seriously, most of the time, when i help people out, a "thanks" and a smile is enough to make me feel good inside. I personally don't expect any more than a "thank you" when i help someone, cos if i did, i'll feel it adds a bit of insincerity, as if i have an ulterior motive for helping. Helping people should be innate, born out of the milk of human kindness (which i admit, many people lack these days), and a simple receprocating gesture (i.e. a thanks and a smile) is enough. I'm quite sure the person at the recieving end of your kindness is very greatful, and as the saying goes "do unto others what u want done unto yourself" (at least i think i went like that).<br><br>hmmm as for the people who don't react with the usual "thanks and a smile", i admit i'll feel a tad pissed, but God works in mysterious ways, so forget it, the person will get what's coming to him. Oh before i end, a favourite quote of mine...<br><br>"Everything that happens in this world happens at a time God chooses" Ecclesiastes 3:1</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Of course there are people who ENJOY helping people for nothing in return, think social service workers and volunteers! And what is your definition of nothing? a simple "thank you" counts for something at least! Do you mean something in the form of tangibles? When you help people you shouldn't expect anything in return, so if they don't reciprocate, you won't be disappointed and if they do, it'll be an added bonus...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yay!!!!! go Ms.Suess!<br><br>im sick and tired of people who loveeeee to martyr(??) themselves, then come whining about how they're "unappreciated" and "taken for granted". firstly, if you really want to help, help because you want to, not because of the pot of gold you're expecting at the end of the rainbow. dont help because you wanna build up on your good deeds so you can be a "good" person. dont do it to impress people. dont do it so you can brag.<br><br>"In other words, you mean that there are people who ENJOYS helping people for nothing in return ? Now that is a rare type of people we don't see..."<br>if that's how you truly think, i dont think you're a very nice guy. there are people out there, who are genuinely helpful because they LIKE IT. they enjoy brightening up someone's day. they enjoy putting a smile on someone's face. they like the feeling of having actually HELPED someone today.<br><br>another pt to take note of, sometimes people DONT WANT your help? case in pt? spy. (not lashing out at you, but this IS the best eg.) yeah, he was HELPING people, but that's not what others think. are you sure your "help" is so valuable? are you sure you actually "helped"? for all you know, others may think your advice is a whole lotta crap, but because they actually appreciate you bothering to come up with it, they dont say anything about how it's as good as not saying anything at all. and there you are complaining they "Give a simple thanks ( yeah yeah )and pretend nothing happeans"<br><br>sigh. damn. i better stop before i get more and more pissed off.<br><br>[This message has been edited by ataraxia (edited 09-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Uhmmm......I also didn't know I'm a rare one....<br><br>Seriously I think that you shouldn't be so cynical about the whole idea of "helping"....<br><br>I know everyone always say that helping always is a bit selfish because you help to feel good about yourself...but I think that's not the reason for a lot of people...They genuinely help because they can sympathise with the other person....It's called consideration....When I help people, i dun really think about why I'm helping them..In fact, i feel very pai say but help anyway because when I see womeone in need of some kind of help I automatically think..."man I don't think he/she can carry that by herself/himslef...better help him/her before they injure themselves or drop things all over the place..."....Uh so I don't think about what i'm going to get in return...and many many people are like this also...<br><br>Just when you help someone, help them without any conditions...it has to be a considered impulsive action...I know it sounds very contradicting, but read deeper into it and you might see the meaning behind it....:-)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yaay atax! Long time no see/read!Welcome back! where have you been??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Forever: Many pple help out today cos of the "wrong" reasons (take compulsory community service for an example), and yeah it does get the job done, but the attitude and the vibe given off is perhaps not quite there. Take your example, yeah the lady did get her seat, but were you actually "helping" her? cos you were getting off the bus, you were not actually doing her a favour now were you? Your action just happened to be to her benefit (all in good timing).If you had instead gotten off maybe five stops later, she would have had to stand for 5 stops. So yeah motive does play a part. And remember the person/animal you're helping is a living thing and can relate to even the slightest of nuances. Its all about the feeling. But maybe in the end it all boils down to you, what did you feel when you gave up your seat? Its better to give than to recieve, makes some pple go all warm and fuzzy inside, what do you feel?? Indifference?<br>Atax was pointing out the fact that there are pple who help cos they want to be assoc with some sort of a recognition. What she's saying is, help cos you want to not cos of the brownie points you earn, which as i've mentioned earlier, is an added bonus, if not, it doesn't matter.<br><br>*knock knock* is your concience still there??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well when it comes to helping others I don't think of getting any thanks in return... I gave up my seat to a mother so she can sit beside her daughter.. its just a feeling that makes you feel good when you help somebody.. like you have contributed a lil bit back to the society....<br><br>Anyways, while I'm not clamouring for medals here... I always think that there should be some sorta *appreciation* in return. I'm not asking people to worship me like a god or anything... Just a smile or a word of thanks to let me know that my help was appreciatated, whether big or small. Its not the appreciation of THE ACT involved but rather, more of the appreciation THE THOUGHT involved, that someone can feel for you to give you the help.<br><br>------------------<br>Why?

            <div class='col-md body'>sheesh<br>okok<br>My apologies to ataraxia and MsSeuss<br>was really sick for the past few days so i cant really make out my thoughts, again.<br>anyway just managed to puke my head off again. so lets hope this posting can shed some light to whatever crap i'm shitting out.<br><br>Anyway, here goes.<br>1st of all, ppl have diffrent reasons to 'help' other ppl. correct??<br><br>for araven's case: araven might have helped someone who seems to need some kindess from araven's angle. right?<br><br>and due to lack of communication its seems that araven had suffered a cold reception for.. her (lets take araven for a girl) warm hospitality<br><br>right??<br><br>so araven's reason to help that person(A) is because she's kind etcetc<br>but that doesnt mean A HAS to accept araven's kindness right?<br><br>For my case, i do help ppl coz they seem to need it. and i always help those that are in need(pregnant ladies, old ladies, etc)<br><br>In this society, its each to his own. i have my reasons to help other ppl, be it good or bad. They still accept it, why? because they don't care whether u gave it up for them or u gave it up for urself. They just want to get the damn seat whether its hot or not, get into that damn queue, get into that damn bus.<br><br>Thats why they sort of like treat u like dirt. I never expect anything for the 'good' things i have done. coz i know the reasons may not be just.<br><br>I can have the choice of giving up that seat for someone who, in my eyes, need it more that i do. They too, have the choice to take that so-called kindness to accept it.<br><br>Its ok if they shun it off, scold me busy body, show off, create commotion, give more trouble to those standing.<br><br>By hey, i dont care.<br>coz i'm doing myself a favor by giving up that seat.<br>if i am doing them a favor by giving up my seat, might as well do them more favor by pestering them to sit on the seat i gave up.<br>scold the other 'seaters' for their uncompassionate acts etcetc.<br><br>And of course, i help ppl not for my reasons and its purely out of compassion.<br><br>Lets say, if i gave up my seat because i wanna alight the bus, and this old man thank me profusely for it. what can i do???<br>similarly, i gave up my seat to an old man,<br>1) some chao ah beng/chao ah lian come and took the seat instead.<br>2) that old cow turns a blind eye and kept standing.<br><br>nothing i can do???<br>something i can do?<br>all i can do is to thank God, that @ least i have help someone, by giving my seat.<br>of course the the 1st case.... its abit.. tough la.. but i won't get angry.<br>because you girls know, ppl dont always get whatever results they have always fought for.<br><br>maybe u girls are still very fiery abt helping ppl.<br>but i have already given my trust to God.<br>I cant make sure of their well being, God can. All i can do is that much.<br>*draws a line<br><br>for (1), i have done my part.<br>God can do His.<br>@ least i am of some WORTH to God to the extend that i am @ the right time, place to do make the choice whther to give up my seat/help carry groceries for those in need(i think)<br>I dont need any help coz i trust God can give me a path to overcome my probs, @ most He can gve me a retreat route.

            <div class='col-md body'>ahem. sorry, but in my books, i would call a guy who thinks someone else is ALWAYS aiming at him when she's not even interested is definitely ego. *shrug* so sue me if you don't agree. when i respond to posts, i respond to the CONTENTS of the post, not the nick behind it. of course, i just might adjust the tone of what i want to say according to who that person is, but other than that, i never "flame" anyone for the sake of flaming.<br><br>secondly, the reason why i cannot understand your posts is because i cannot understand what you're WRITING. i would appreciate it if you could paragraph your posts... as in. HAVE PARAGRAPHS. i simply find it very hard to understand what you're writing. if that makes me a "little girl".. *shrug* so be it.<br><br>------------------<br>I believe in the sun, even when it is not shining.<br>I believe in love, even when i do not feel it.<br>I believe in God, even when He is silent.</div>
