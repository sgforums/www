            <div class='col-md body'>Hello! I am Jeff, a JC1 student from Catholic Junior College. Basically, JC1s are required to do something called "Project Work". It's essentially just what it is, a project. It is important to us as it is considered an 'A' level subject. A group has about 4 members, and they are required to choose a topic (Either 'Momentum' or 'Tradition'), and fulfill the requirements(which is, actually, not as easy as it seems). Thats just the tip of the iceberg for this killer thing called the Project Work, heh.<br><br>Well, to cut things real short: basically one of the ways for us to collect information about our project is to get some information/comments etc on local forums. Thus, here comes this post!<br><br>My group is doing Momentum, and our topic of interest is about the traffic (or rather, the congestion) of Singapore. Therefore, we have to think of several "new, unique, manageable, feasible" ideas to solve this congestion problem. The 4 words are in "" as it isnt as straightforward as it looks and appears. For instance some ideas may look old and though before, but because it is not implemented before, it can be considered "new". But yeah, some ideas are used before and we are reusing them again.<br><br>Our ideas to combat congestion are(right from our group proposal):<br><br>1.	<strong>Encourage ownership of weekend cars</strong><br>Â•	As weekend cars do not contribute to the peak hour congestion,    encouraging the ownership of weekend cars will aid in the reduction of traffic congestion. Discount cards on petrol and parking for the owners of the weekend cars can be given to further encourage people to buy these weekend cars compared to normal cars. The lower cost of a weekend car may also serve as an encouragement for people to buy it rather than a normal car.<br><br>2.	<strong>Introduce Â“Traffic DayÂ”</strong><br>Â•	Â“Traffic DayÂ” will coincide with Â“Green DayÂ”, where people are encouraged to use public transports. The fares for public transport will be totally subsidized by the LTA to further encourage more commuters. To ease the subsidization and at the same time discourage drivers from driving on that day, the ERP could be increased.<br><br>3.	<strong>Create a song/rap on traffic congestion</strong><br>Â•	We will create a song/rap that preferably has a catchy and slightly comedic tone, with Singlish added in. The song/rap will be easy to understand and has easy lyrics to remember. This will create a larger impact of the song/rap on Singaporeans. A competition will also be held for preferably school students (which are the future road users) to produce a song/rap that describes public transportÂ’s effectiveness and its benefits. A web log will be made to host our song/rap and any contestants songs/raps to promote our song, and the competition to the public. The song will also be broadcasted on the television and FM radios - to reach out to drivers Â– to promote the song.<br><br>4.	<strong>Install weight sensors on roads</strong><br>Â•	Weight sensors are connected to cameras, working coherently with each other to capture photographs to cars that stop at the roadside for too long. The weight sensors will be placed on roads with double yellow zigzag lines. The photographs will also be referred to the police.<br><br>5.	<strong>Reduction of service roads</strong><br>Â•	The service roads for various shopping complexes will converted into a long stretch of common service road for all. It will only have one entrance and one exit for the stretch of road serving the shopping complexes (e.g. Orchard Road). This reduces congestion as the main road is only used for traveling across Orchard Road. For example, the service roads for Far East Plaza, Grand Hyatt Hotel and Scotts Shopping Center could be combined, such that the only entrance is from Far East Plaza, and exit at the end of Scotts Shopping Center. This solves the problem of cars filtering in and out of Scotts road. A rule stating that cars should only be given ample time to alight passengers must be enforced for this idea to be effective. The respective valets/security guards of each hotel /shopping center could enforce such a law.<br><br>6.	<strong>Introduce measures to speed up traffic flow</strong><br>Â•	It is not rare to see cars traveling at the same speeds driving side by side, taking up all available lanes, and effectively setting up their own speed limit by preventing cars behind them from overtaking. Though not written in traffic rules or enforced for that matter, it is common knowledge that Lane 1 is for cars traveling at high speeds, and for overtaking. Slower vehicles such as buses and motorcycles are urged to keep to the left-most lane. A campaign could be introduced to re-instate this idea of differing speeds for different lanes, and constantly remind motorists to keep to their traveling speedÂ’s designated lanes, hence reducing congestion caused by slow drivers holding up other drivers behind them.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">As of now, I hope we could hear comments like your thoughts on such ideas being implemented in Singapore, and whether you think it will be effective/efficient in reducing congestion. Also, if not, please do explain why not too! Any other comments, etc are MUCH appreciated! Also, please DO tell me your age and whether you drive. Thank you very very much! =D</span><br><br>Jeff ( xeffex@gmail.com )<br>[/i]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't see how point 4 can help reduce traffic congestion. So what if you place a weight sensor and send them to traffic police? They will still do it despite all the fines and demerit points. Besides, they only can't drive for a while when enough demerit points are accumulated. It doesn't improve the situation, it only worsens the situation as new equipment requires money. Who pay for them?<br><br>For point 1, it only worsens traffic conditions on weekends. Solve weekdays problem, create weekend traffic jams?<br><br>Point 5: waste taxpayers' money, and how viable is this?<br><br>I don't drive.....</div>

Since there is a car forum, is it possible if the FI(or what i'm guessing is the moderator) to move this thread over there? Thanks.<br><br>And for you information, this ISNT a survey. My group did conduct surveys in real life. We did only 50 though. This is just ANOTHER method of gathering information. If you want to take a look at our groups survey, drop me an email.<br><br>Yup, its a little long, so I'll just thank you for your time first!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
