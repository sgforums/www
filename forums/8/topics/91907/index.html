There's a place selling alot of jade jewellery. I spotted jade bangles and took a look. I pointed at this green jade bangle with light carvings, and then the owner took it out for me.<br><br>She was saying that when people buy jade, must see if the jade is fated to be with the buyer, and also that alot of people had wanted to buy the piece I pointed out, but they couldn't fit into it. Well I can ahahahahahha.<br><br>I don't know if I'm really that fated with that bangle (maybe she was trying to make it sound nice so I'd buy?), but I do like that bangle quite alot.<br><br>It costs $250 and comes with a certificate of authenticity.<br><br>I would buy it, but I don't earn that much every month and I don't want to buy it because I've (alright I admit!) been taken in by her words.<br><br>I think $250 is quite reasonable, considering that it looks reputable and even comes with that certificate.<br><br>Hmmmm.<br><br>SHOULD I BUY?????????????</div>
