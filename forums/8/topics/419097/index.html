I know we will always say what if the owner is lookin for it etc. But what if they are not?
              </span></p><div><br></div>
              <div>I live near this primary school and somehow the kids are fairly well to do. So you find in their lost and found near he canteen heaps of good water bottles (like over 20 over different colours of Nike, sigg, nalgenes etc), pencil cases filled to the brim with nice stationery to nice branded backpacks, recorders, good dictioneries, branded glasses, branded file holders, etc. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>It's now nearing the new school term and they all sit there in the lost and found unclaimed. The lost and found is so full that some spill on the floor, some fall behind the shelves and no one seems to care for them. I think the cleaners throw them out before next year and in less than three months, it will all  be filled up again! Every few months, the lost and found shelves become so full that they have to be cleared. I suspect many do not claim them and they go to the garbage. I really don't mind changing my water bottle every couple of months really and just washing these nice bottles should be fine! You xan even take your pick on colour too! </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The kids really don't seem to care for them and probably not even miss them as parents buy them new ones! You can tell they dont trasure their stuff since they Like doodle f words and other rubbish over a 30 dollar pencil cases filled with nice  pens inside....  I just saw one where this kid even bite and leave teethmarks on real Mont blanc pens (she has a few mont blanc anyway so she probably dont need to care and her pencil case has the full range of color gel pens) or another seemed to have taken a<span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.292969);  "> pen knife and carve out wrongly spelt names of maple characters on a new practically unused Nike $25 straw bottle, to nalgene bottles that have also been doodled with a marker and heaps of used but new looking yamaha recorders while many people in my sisters school have no money to buy even their own recorders and must share the school one. </span></div>

              <div>Like even if the cleaners take some, I don't think they can take 30 over waterbottles home? Like what a waste to throw a new looking Nike bottle or an ugly defaced pencil case outside with a few mont blanc inside. (ok the girl chewed her pens but I still don't mind using it) or I could even bring a few recorders and files home if they are to be thrown away.  I dont mind used things honestly. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>And next year by March, I can almost guarantee you see another lot of these nice things. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>I agree If I take it in March, there is a slim chance a sobbing girl is looking for it. But end of year, I doubt so. Plus if you really treasure something, you won't anyhow bite it or take marker and anyhow draw on them too right?</div>

              <p>i think it is sad that so many bottles find their way to a lost and found section. kids have no sense of responsibility these days. lose something, why bother to even go to the lost and found? just buy another one.</p>
              <p>if i was the school principal, i would have a 1 week holding period. then donate the items to charity.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Anyway, all gone. apparently they dumped them all into the garbage. Figured no one wanted them. School auntie complain say every year like this, some more so heavy to carry to garbage. Damn. Should have taken them. Anyway, There are already some fresh new waterbottles, books and stationery again just from this year alone. Hmm. Kids these days too rich, Too careless and don't even care for their things. Saw a girl today on bus, defacing her brand new looking school bag with a marker and her friends all laughing about it. What so funny? Your parents working so hard so that you can be an idiot to draw on your bag. Bet you the bag will end in the garbage only in a couple of months, well before it's end of life. And some poor parent is slogging away. </p></div>

              <p><br>True</p>
              <p>You can offer to bring those new usable stuff to needy kids. Maybe to those in your sister's class.</p>
              <p>Either that or you can ask to salvage some items during the year's end when the school aunties are bringing them out to the trash.</p>
              <p>No harm taking what's going into the trash. But it's definitely not ok to take them before the holding period is up.</p>
