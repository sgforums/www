            <div class='col-md body'>From http://food.asia1.com.sg/gdfd/fea_20050108_001.shtml:<br><br><blockquote><br>BRAZIL CHURRASCARIA<br><br>Martin Spykerman was in the ship repair business when he discovered a barbecue restaurant in 1987 in Lisbon called Fla-Flu. He liked the concept of a place where meat waiters - or passadors - carved slices of different types of meat directly onto the plates of customers, who could eat as much as they wanted for a fixed price. In other words, if you can't go to the buffet, the buffet comes to you.<br><br>Seven years later, he parlayed his dining experience into Brazil Churrascaria, where for $37+++, you can sample 15 types of specially marinated meats. The restaurant's industrial-strength rotisserie can accommodate 45 skewers at once and among other things, Mr Spykerman brings in about one-and-a-half tonnes of Australian beef every month.<br><br>'It's a different style of dining - we provide value for money,' says Mr Spykerman. To date, no one has managed to eat much more than a kilo of meat at one sitting, and that includes national swimmers on high-protein diets, hungry national servicemen and even a group of junior sumo wrestlers from Japan.<br><br>According to Mr Spykerman, who spent several months living in Brazil while researching the business, Brazilians like their meats to be either extremely sweet or extremely salty. He has moderated the taste for Singaporeans, who particularly like the rump cuts of beef (picanha) and also chicken hearts.<br><br>The restaurant now has an association with the more up-market Las Pampas restaurant in the business district, where a limited version of the skewer service is offered. Mr Spykerman says he is also in discussions to open joint venture churrascaria restaurants in India, Kuwait and Indonesia.<br><br>Brazil Churrascaria<br>14/16 Sixth Avenue<br>Tel: 6463-1923 (dinner only)<br><br></blockquote></div>

I was told they did not have a waiting list.<br><br>I walked away, cursing myself for not making a reservation and looked around for an alternative.<br><br>However, my friend, an expatriate, went to the restaurant and was ushered immediately to a table. When he called me on my mobile phone to tell me he got us a table, I was shocked.<br><br>The lead waiter recognised me when I returned to the restaurant. I demanded to know why expatriates were given preferential treatment and he shrugged his shoulders. I told him I would get to the bottom of the matter. Later he came to apologise but the damage had been done.<br><br>Is it a common practice for a restaurant to choose its customers based on their race? To me, it looked like the restaurant was practising a modern-day caste system.<br><br>Never in my wildest nightmare could I imagine I would be a victim of discrimination in my own homeland. This is because we pride ourselves as a society which treats people of all races, languages and religions equally.<br><br>I decided I would never patronise such a restaurant again, no matter how good the food might be.<br><br>Long Tien Kian<br></div></blockquote>well ........ i'd do the same if i was the waiter. business is business. bottomline is this. as long as i can make the jap's or caucasian's money fly into my pocket, it doesn't matter if they think i respect them. we still need their words-of-mouth about our hospitality to their cronies back home, to serve as free advertising for more foreign investments. ultimately, we cash in on more jap yen and US$ flowing into our tourist industry. but the moment they cross the line exploiting us at our expense, they beg for a rude awakening on proper respect host should expect from guest <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
