On the capsule itself, there was a note by Dr Thomas Light stating that the robot was placed in hibernation for 100 years for stablization of the robot. The robot's name was Megaman X.<br><br>Dr Cain studied Megaman X and created a city of robots that could feel and think for themselves called Reploids.<br><br>Some Reploids became unstable and thus, were labelled as Mavericks and were hunted down by special task force called Maverick Hunters.<br><br>Some time later, a capsule was found containing a red Reploid.

( An extremely long time after Megaman X )<br><br>The world was covered with water and people have to get around the world using flying ships. People called Diggers explore ruins searching for treasure. The most wanted treasure was the Mother Lode.<br><br>A mysterious baby and a monkey called Data was adopted by Dr Barrel and raised together with his daughter, Roll. The baby was named Megaman.<br><br>Megaman was a Digger and Roll was his Spotter. A Spotter gives directions to the Digger while on explorations.<br><br>The main villians were the Bonnes, a family of pirates. The Bonnes family logo happened to be skull shaped too, similar to Dr Willy's.<br><br>In Megaman Legends, the dugeons and ruins seemed of a higher technology compared to the people living in that world. There was also a place in space called the Elysium.<br><br>Assumptions: X finally created Elysium, a place where Reploids and humans could coexist together. However, the earth was being badly damaged by some unknown forces. The humans living in the Elysium sooned died out and Megaman Trigger was the first clone of the last real human.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
