              <p>hey i'm back again mum's nagging again gtg soon. i'll copy and paste what i typed over the other site :)</p>
              <p>i'm currently drawing this wip and taking a break from my other drawings. i aim to make this drawing surreal/fantasy styled. when i 1st saw the model for this drawing ( the pic she sent me ), i knew what i wanted for this drawing and that the reference was perfect. i wanted to draw a lady with a peaceful expression. this drawing is done on an A3 size paper. these are the wips. ( you can see in the process i changed her facial proportions ).</p>

              <p>the wips are all taken with my mobile phone. for the last wip, heres what i wrote in other forums.' i'm back with the final wip of this drawing. i just sketched out the other half of the concept of this drawing with the dead trees, cage and outline of the dove. these are at really sort of rought sketch stage, i will add details and contrast and build on more shadings to them on the final drawing. i'll continue with the hand as i've not touch that part of the drawing that much yet and also gonna shade up the area of the smaller flowers and shape the fire lining of the drawing. <br>i will tell more about this drawing after i've completed it. :P '</p>
              <p>i'll be back gtg. hope you'll like it so far. :)</p>

              <p>Hi everyone, i have not been on here too much lately but finally i'm able to post the 'completed version of the Anointment drawing . its not officially completed, but thats almost about it since there will not be too many changes left. before i post thie scanned update here and at DA, i will give a scan of this drawing at sch this coming tuesday. <br><br>so 1stly, let me describe my views about this drawing and its meaning.<br>i was talking to an artist friend of mine Lorah ( some of you may know her as Silentportrait on DA ) on windows messenger and she sent me some of her photos for me to choose which to draw. then i saw one that caught my eyes. i just saw her peaceful expression and i thought of half the concept of the drawing already.<br><br>i was stuck a point when i was wrecking my brains about the other half of the concept which is on the other half ( viewer's right half ) of the drawing. i was singing some praise songs in my room and sang the lyrics ,' you are my freedom, Jesus you're the reason........', and i received the concept like an almost immediate revelation for the concept of the drawing. <br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The technical stuff</span><br>i used a reference for the face in the drawing as well as the flowers. the hand (which isn't that well drawn ) i used my hand as a reference. i will fill in some shades more at the upper finger. the rest of the drawing i've done without reference. <br><br>the most rendered part of the drawing is the character's hair and face. the other areas of the drawing, the technics are just about a mess, but it did not destroy my aim for this drawing. i changed her hair from the reference making it longer with slight curls, i think it gives the character, the emotion some flow of feel. i am pretty happy at how the cage and its concept turned out. i took a long long time to figure on drawing the clouds and i love drawing the light. <br><br>i apologize that the dove can hardly be seen... i will think of ways to improve on it before the final scan. <br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The !st half concept explaination</span><br>the drawing has a religious meaning to it. i believe there is a God and He is the way to eternal happiness. The girl in the drawing is a person accepting God into her life thus at the same time is receiving salvation from God. God then gives her anointing throughout her journey of salvation to give her a direction in life, to bless her in all things she does. the hand above her head signifies God's blessings and empowerment and the the gas-like aura flows down likw river flowing like how i've always thought how the spirit of God flows. the flowers are drawn from starglazer ( or glacier i forgot ) lilies. star means light and light signifies life. i wanted this drawing to have peace as its primary expression. peace is an improtant factor to balance out the other side of our busy, and at times chaotic lives. <br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The other half of the concept explaination</span><br>i drew the trees to represent people on earth portrayed here as dead trees. the wooden cage is a more straightforward form of the dead trees. the cage has vines all over it, its means that people's life is held like a vice by satan. satan tir us down with his lies and temptations. the vines represents constraint. <br><br>when the girl ( used as an example of a person receiving salvation ), accepts God as her rightful Saviour and God, the glory of God shines upon the demons, spirits, satan and bondages in her life. satan and the spirits of temptation and bondages flee with fear of God's holiness and power. <br><br>the dove represents the girl that escaped from satan's wrath and goes back to God. its represents freedom and happiness.<br><br>here goes nothing :P...</p>

              <p><strong><strong>The Saviour saves, He keeps our lives in bliss, protects us from evil<br></strong><br></strong>i dedicate this to Jesus whom i believe in and also fellow artist Lorah.<br>( drawing is very blurred as it is taken with a 2 mega pixel camera phone )<br><br>hope you guys like it and i do need some critques, thanks :)</p>
