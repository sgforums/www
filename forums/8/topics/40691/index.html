            <div class='col-md body'>A very tricky situation. Cause like what you mentioned, both of you can't promise each other the amount and quality of time spent together, which is what a fresh couple need most. And overseas relationship really seldom work out.<br><br>Unless, both of you have been friends for a long time. And that both of you trust each other's feelings, then maybe that is another different thing.<br><br>So, you must really give it a thorough consideration. I really don't know how to put it in words, but seriously, all the decision is still up to you. Do you want to risk it?<br><br>Anyway, sometimes, you need to be a little rash to make some most important decisions in life. Good luck man.</div>
