            <div class='col-md body'>LOL, cosmopolitan!<br>Singapore as a whole cannot be described as cosmopolitan, perhaps only a small section of the society can be classified as that.  Look at the environment and situation.  Maybe we are working through a different definition of what cosmopolitan is.<br><br>Getting a citizenship or residency elsewhere is not a bad thing.  THere is no such well maybe in the places i have been to as 2nd class citizenship.  What is that?  Which class you percieve yourself as being in is a result of your own insecurities.<br><br>Nothing against Singapore, but what are the reasons for choosing to migrate?  Economic? Political? Health?  It varies but often there will have to be a factor that results in that decision.<br><br>Just out of interest, what is the current climate in singapore like?  Am interested to understand if there have been changes happening through the singaporean society in the past 2 years?  Friends have told me that there is a movement towards a less conformist society, are there any comments to that?<br><br>There will be issues such as the political expression and so forth but thats another topic, though they are related.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>IMHO....<br><br>At the end of the day, it is the pull and push factors that you ahve to look at when considering moving on to another countries.  This will includes the personal considerations (career,preference of political system, lifestyle, family, friends, in-laws etc etc), and the external considerations (type of govt,housing, govt policy).<br><br>Of course some of the considerations can be the over whelming factors in deciding the choice to move.  I noe of ppl moving/not moving becos of family / parents.<br><br>Currently, I am working overseas as well... and from a personal persepctive, my roots are in SGP.  I grow up in SGP.. friends/family/social circle are all in SGP and this is what i go back to when I am back in SGP.<br><br>One thing to note... the issue of migrating has reduce significantly over the last 2 decades from my point of view... with the improvement in air travel, the invention of WWW (bless Skype and webcams)... the distance / fear of up rooting to another place is not tat daunting anymore.</div>
