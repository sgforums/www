            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">Taken from the net. A migrant residing in AUS gives his views</span><br><br>Ok, let me put my post into context. I am 34, finished my NS and have been in Oz for about 8 years now.<br><br>Why did I leave Sg? Because of the chance to actually be anything you want to be.<br><br>****** says  he left because Sg today is not the Sg he knew (hope I got this right ).I agree witrh him 100%. For those who are older, look back to the time when you were growing up. Think of your family, friends, neighbours and work-mates. People were friendly, helpful, generous and genuine. I am not saying people in Sg today are not this way. far from it. I am sure that deep down inside, the psyche has not changed. However, the focus has shifted from community to self. Why? I feel because of the direction the country has taken steered by the leadership. People in Sg have become self centered for no other reason than because they realise that if they don't look out for themselves, no one will.<br><br>I did a self assessment a couple of years ago and came to some conclusions.<br><br>1. In Singapore, you own nothing of significance. what do I mean? The house you live in (be it HDB, private apt, semi-detached, 99 year lease or free-hold) is basically rented by you<br><br>Your car that you have bought and paid for is also actually leased for 10 years extendedable for another 10 years at a higher tax rate after which it needs to be basically crushed for scrap metal. You get a token sub for the metal but that's it.<br><br>4. When you reach the legal age of an adult, you are for all intents and purposes responsible for your actions. However, you can't touch you CPF unless you want to buy a flat, can only use a protion of your medisave, medishield for your hospital bills and pay the rest in cash. Can't do as you please with your nest egg because you can't. You are legally an adult but are treated like a child because the they does not deem you able to make rational decisions so they decide for you.<br><br>5. They decides how good you are based on academic acheivement judged by arbitrary methods. Your life and future is decided for you and if you cannot afford to persue an overseas education, you are stuck<br><br>I was only allowed to go to the VITB after my 'O' levels because I failed my 2nd language (chinese). I did my NS as a storeman LCP, did some menial jobs before I could afford to go for an overseas education and today, I hold a research masters degree and write journal articles for an academic publicaion. My point is I feel I have fulfilled my potential. Fulfilled it because I DETERMINED what I wanted to do and worked to acheive it. It is something I would NEVER have been able to in Sg because according to them, I should have gone to the VITB. There is nothing wrong with going to the VITB, but you should have the chance to decide what you want to do and not have that decision made for you. You decide and see how far you can push your dream.<br><br>I was born in Singapore, Lived in Singapore till I was 23 and went overseas to see what my actual limits were. as I could not do it in the country of my birth. I will not return to Sg because everything that I have acheived, I did in Oz. Australia allowed me to realise my potential and decide how far I wanted to go. I would rather make a contribution to the people and country that gave me this chance rather than return to the country that would not. Yes, by their measure, I am a quitter. But I quit because of the management and office environment and quitting is my right, not privilage.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Racism or being a 2nd clz citizen is always the standard reply to discourage anyone wanting to go overseas so much so that i think it might the govt that is actually propogating this idea...<br><br>anyway, i find his point that he was able to go on to further academic achievements overseas a real good one. In singapore, its alittle too constrainted. Its always like em3 muz go normal tech muz go ITE...blah blah.<br><br>But then Singapore is a pragmatic country like the govt say and of course the citizens ought to be pragmatic themselves and seek greener pastures. Stuff like quitters and stayers are simply silly. Why not say that singapore has quit on some of its less academically weaker people...<br><br>Singapore only cares about its elite and, sad to say, doesn't bother much about its less priviledged. In this case it is only reciprocal that the elite only care about seeking greener pastures and leaving the less green ones behind.</div>
