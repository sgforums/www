            <div class='col-md body'>The Straits Times<br>January 21, 2005<br><br>A TOP Chinese government official has branded China Aviation Oil's (CAO's) suspended boss, Mr Chen Jiulin, 'a third-rate speculator and a man who lacks a deep understanding of the futures business'.<br><br>Mr Li Jiange, deputy director of the State Council's development research centre, painted Mr Chen as a business novice who got in well over his head when he involved CAO in derivatives trading.<br><br>Mr Li, who was speaking at a seminar hosted recently by Caijing Magazine, said the CAO debacle was an example of how difficult it was for the government to supervise the overseas activities of such entities.<br><br>'I read newspaper reports of Chen Jiulin's recent troubles.<br><br>'After the matter was exposed and handed over to the law, he said that the crisis would have been resolved if the Chinese government had given him money to tide over two more weeks,' Mr Li was quoted as saying by Lianhe Zaobao last week.<br><br>Mr Li, who had previously been involved in futures dealing in China, said rivals in the market were forcing CAO, which supplies jet fuel to airlines at China's airports, to hold stocks until it could no longer do so.<br><br>He added that prices would have continued to rise and not fall even if Mr Chen had been given his two extra weeks.<br><br>'I do not know if he was defending himself or he really did not understand futures trading,' said Mr Li.<br><br>'It is understandable if he were defending himself. If he really did not understand futures and speculated in the international market, (he would only make losses)...he may be only third-rate when compared to other futures speculators in China.'<br><br>After the debacle came to light, Mr Chen had apologised to investors many times but would only admit that his mistake was to 'trust others too much'.<br><br>Caijing Magazine had said last year in a report that Mr Chen, who went to Beijing University in 1982 after surviving the Cultural Revolution, did not know anything about futures trading.<br><br>Even when CAO's losses were mounting, he failed to stop the trading and insisted that he had judged the market correctly and that the accounting losses were not actual losses.<br><br>The end came on Nov 30 when CAO disclosed that it had lost more than US$550 million in derivatives trading.<br><br>According to reports, CAO sold put options at US$3 a barrel or US$22 a tonne, meaning CAO sold options to dealers who could then buy oil from CAO at a fixed price.<br><br>CAO was then required to deliver the oil by buying from the market at the prevailing price. Disaster struck when CAO expected oil prices to be below US$400 a tonne but they hit US$450 a tonne instead.<br><br>Faced with these losses, a Xinhua report claimed that CAO reversed its strategy.<br><br>Mr Chen then bought futures contracts, betting that oil would continue to rise. But prices dropped from US$56 to US$42, again resulting in huge losses for CAO.<br><br>Xinhua had also claimed that CAO was lax about its accounting.<br><br>It said that the large amounts of money spent on the derivatives market were merely reflected in the company's accounts as debtors.<br><br>Meanwhile, a Reuters report quoting a source yesterday said CAO is set to get a cash lifeline from its Beijing parent, China Aviation Oil Holding Company (CAOHC), and Temasek Holdings when it unveils a rescue plan next Monday.<br><br>The capital, which would be less than the US$100 million CAO has said it needs, would give the company more time to work out its debt problems, the source said.<br><br>'The money is likely to be used for the group's working capital,' said the source, adding that the injection was subject to an agreement between CAO, CAOHC and Temasek.<br><br>CAO had earlier said that its rescue plan called for a US$100 million capital injection by its Beijing parent and Temasek.<br><br>The company also got an extension yesterday from the Singapore Exchange to file its annual report after it pointed out that its working files, which are required to prepare the financial results, are still with the Commercial Affairs Department.<br><br></div>
