Not that i canot accept it but I will like to know her thinking and perception about sex be4 marriage blah blah blah. It is part of knowing that person. If I can accept her thoughts, i will accept her.<br><br>And if you (and Rinoa) have discovered, most of the time in my posts, i mentioned me offering my virginity to my wife and not the other way round.<br><br>The other day i was chatting with my fren about this issue. She said her hubby MUST BE a virgin. Then I commented,"Not that bad if he is not a virgin as long as he truly loves you. The worse is, he is a virgin, but when he is making love to you, he is thinking of someone else..." And you CAN'T tell.<br><br>Rinoa, you are very right ! I share the same thought as you, truthfulness and honesty is of most important  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There's been a change of views and attitudes regarding the issue of virginity over the past century. It was merely an act or process that you have to go through to start a family in the early 20th century. Thus, anyone who is not a virgin would be consider to be 'unpure' etc. In fact, to enjoy sex was somehow regarded as a sin. However, as time passes and more emphasis was placed on status, money etc, the world has turned over-materialistic and cold. Young girls who are sexually un-experienced fetch a much higher price than those who are in the prostitution business. This shows that virginity is still desired by men.<br><br>On a more personal note, I think that its all in the state of mind. It really comes down to your own interpretation of the word 'virginity'. If it merely means the presence of the hymen, then so be it. I tend to think of it as the first sexual experience with the one you love. You make love instead of having sex. It might sound lame now but for those who's been there done that, I am sure you know what I mean.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>isn't this whole virginity issue a trust thing? if you're a guy, and you find out that your true love (ie: your wife) strongly feels that both of you should be virgins, would you tell her you were even if you weren't, because you know how much it would mean to her?<br><br>i guess that would apply to girls as well huh. for guys, there would be no fool-proof way of knowing if your wife was a virgin or not. you would just have to trust them if you  ask them.<br><br>anyway, as MayaJade said, the most important thing is that he/she is the last, not necessarily the first<br><br>ps: having said all this, please believe me that it is much better for your peace-of-mind that you don't lie to the one you love about something as sensitive as virginity......who knows when it may slip out!! tee! hee!<br></div>
