              <p>Thing about childcare centres, at least their place is made really into a playground for the kids.</p>
              <p>Look at the young couples and their homes.  Place is more often then not, made so nice, but cannot be used to house children or let them play properly.</p>
              <p>Most young couple parents think they should only limit children's playroom to the children's bedroom.</p>

              <p>Some childcare, the playground is also for show only.</p>
              <p>To pay at least 500 a month (per child) for sub-standard food and treatment? The best is to be looked after by the own mother and sent to those few-hour classes. However, due to the high living standard, it is almost impossible to do so.</p>
              <p>The child is at the age whereby he is easily influenced, with teachers that behaves negatively (pay peanut and get monkey), the kids will also grow up that way. It is probably why, nowadays, there are many social problem with our youth.</p>

              <p>I think you were in a before/after school care. Furthermore, you're old enough to tell on them. They're not stupid to do it to you but how about those who are very young (e.g. below 4 years old?)</p>
              <p>Of course it is not all childcare centre are lousy, but do you know which one is okay? You dun, cos you won't get to know.</p>
              <p>Just ask any honest friend who is in the childcare industry and you'll find out.</p>

It is not true your child will be favor treated just by showing off pick-up by higher car. People thinking and believing in this way is already corrupted moral.

              <p>Ha..why so uptight about what I write unless I'm saying something you deem threatening or dear to you? As I said earlier, I heard this from someone who is in the industry and maybe not all centres are lousy (what I wrote was about what had happened some centres, just to share with others on what to look out for if they intend to place their kids in one).</p>
              <p>I happy for you that you helped out as a volunteer in a childcare centre during your secondary school days, not many would do something so positive at that age (in fact, I had never seen anyone doing it unless the helpers are the operator's relatives). I guessed you only helped out in one centre? (I may be wrong) In any case, the stories that I heard are from staff from a few centres.</p>
              <p>I leave the readers here to decided what they read. I have nothing to gain from what I had written from my initial posting cos I'm not promoting any alternative place to put the kids.</p>

              <p>STOMPer <strong>Frankie Tan</strong> is worried and puzzled as to why his son cries every time he sees his new K2 teacher. <br><br>In an email to STOMP today (Aug 31), the STOMPer says:<br><br>“For
              the past two months, my son has been very stressed and fearful when he
              goes to childcare. He is scared of one of the new teachers which the
              childcare has just employed.<br><br>“He cries every day when he reaches childcare, and the moment he sees that teacher, he starts crying immediately.<br><br>“Ever
              since he knew that this teacher would be teaching him in K2, he has
              been telling us he does not want to go K2 (same for some of his
              classmates). He even requested us to change school for him.<br> <br>“For
              the past three years, we are very glad and thankful that our son is in
              good hands, and we have no worries when we are working. I noticed his
              positive changes since the day he started going to this childcare. We
              really appreciate the care and concern which the teachers have shown
              towards my son.<br> <br>“Now, we are very concern about this issue
              which he is facing and have already spoken to the childcare
              person-in-charge (twice) and that teacher personally. We don't see any
              improvement at all.<br> <br>“As parent, we just want our kid to be
              happy and not be stressed and fearful during his long hours in
              childcare. The government has been encouraging Singaporeans to have
              more babies but first of all, we must ensure that our kids are in good
              hands. <br> <br>“Childcare teachers should let the child feel safe and
              comfortable when they are with them. Imaging our kids having to be with
              a stranger at such a young age.<br><br>“All the teachers in this
              childcare have no issues with my son, and the feedback I receive is
              that my son is quite well-behaved in school.<br> <br>“Now we are very
              worried that this will affect his development (mentally and
              physically). By bringing this matter out, hopefully we can know the
              standard of teachers most childcare centres have."</p>
