              <p>A friend told me that there are many secrets within each childcare centre and it is not as good as it seems. It is all about profit and nothing else. He knows because his relative had been in the industry for at least 15 years. These are some of it that the relative had seen (I do not know if it is the truth or not, maybe some of you who also had knowledge can share it here):</p>
              <p>a) They put a lot of MSG into the food in order to cut cost. Dun believe in the menu that they show you. Make surprise visit if you can. If the staff themselves dun eat in the centre, it is a warning sign that the food is of sub-standard.</p>
              <p>b) The amount served to the children are pathetic (e.g. for tea break each child only given half slice of bread). Observe if your child had been losing weight since being placed in the childcare.</p>
              <p>c) Some of the teachers are actually untrained (Better ask the school to show you the teacher's certificate before enrollment, speak to the teacher personally to assess). This is to cut cost as untrained are cheaper.</p>
              <p>d) Some of the young children are treated quite badly and it is not found out because the child is too young to express himself (e.g. teacher accidentally drop infant onto the floor but did not inform the parents). If your child still refuses to go to school after 3 months. Something may not be right. Find out.</p>
              <p>e) Some so called 'montessori' childcare centre, only 1 teacher is trained and the rest are untrained. So you're not getting what you're paying for (again, ask for the teacher's certificate).</p>
              <p>f) If you complain about the teacher, they will just leave the child alone and not guide him from then on.</p>
              <p>g) Some scream and shout into the child's ear when they misbehave.</p>
              <p>h) If the child eats too slow, they will either force feed the child or just remove the food when time is up.</p>
              <p>i) Some of the teachers are treated badly too. With unreasonable working hours, petty employers, exceptionally long bonds for training courses (e.g. 3 or 5 years bond for diploma which the centre pay minimal sum) and low pay (around $1200 for teachers). It is unlikely to get motivated and good teacher.</p>
              <p>j) Some will bitch about the parents infront of the kids (e.g. if the mother is known to be working in a club, some will ask the child if she wants to be a hostess when she grows up).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is all the truth?</p>
