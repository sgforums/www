            <div class='col-md body'>ok. i may not be christian, but i have heard of the story of Noah's Ark and how the dinosaurs missed the boat.<br>Anyway, this noah's ark was also mentioned by the jews in their torah(hope its spelled correctly) and the muslims in their Quran, besides the Christian Bible.<br><br>One thing i would find interesting is, that the same person his ship would have been mentioned in these books which are some of the oldest books of mankind. I personally think there is some measure of truth in it, and other written history texts of other very old civilizations, lost or still surviving, have all spoken about some great catastrophe in the distant past, and they have mostly mentioned about a great flood.<br><br>Now the thing is, IF there was a Noah's ark, then there must be some remains. And Noah's ark is said to be resting on Mount Ararat. now take a look at these pictures. tell me whats your impression of them.<br><br><img src="http://perso.club-internet.fr/chuot/kurdistan/ararat/noahsark2.jpg"><br><img src="http://johnw.host.sk/photo/images/AreaWhereNoah_sArkFound.JPG"><br><br>btw, pls keep this discussion free of any religious biasedness. i would like everyone to look at it and discuss this in a more historical and archeological manner.

            <div class='col-md body'>Bah ! There is nothing to it. In America there is a rebuilt Noah's Ark project where some church people wanna built up the Ark according to the dimensions tat time. If you believe tat dustbowl is the Noah's Ark, then take some part of it for carbon dating and see if the date matches. It has even include the wood that was built for the Ark, and after 7000 years it is likely it is gone. No matter how big it will be gone. Wood is a natural material remember ? There is bound to be some insect or bateria that consume them. Every autumn in continental countries trees will drop a lot of leaves throughout. They still dissappear after winter isn't it ?<br><br>And the tyrannosaur never make it to the Ark BECAUSE they are already extinct before tat ! In the Ice Age there r already few or no dinosaurs left. Theoretically a human never meet a dinosaur before, so if Noah is there, dinosaurs r already dead as dodo. Someone (God) has killed them all without giving a reason.<br></div>
