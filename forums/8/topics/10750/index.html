            <div class='col-md body'>I got quite a lot though i still don't believe in them. Hahaha. All happened in my room.<br>(Take note, most of them can be just coincidences)<br><br>This happen many times by the way. My air-con refuses to be switched on by the remote, or even manually. I pressed and pressed and nothing happened...Suddenly it just beep and on. And then i wasnt happy and wanted to off it, and stil i cant.(i got batteries in the remote by the way) Gf was on the phone, joked to me and told me to said "i love you" to the air-con. I did it for fun and beep, it went off. Spooked me but hey it could be coincidence.<br><br>Many times i woke up in the middle of the night finding my computer on for no reason. I definitely off it before i slept...so might be some problem with the circuit or something.<br><br>Lastly, is the one that at least made me afraid. You might not believe me, but to me its real. Take it for a nice ghost story if you dont believe. Just dont flame me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I was sleeping in my room...it was around 3-4am. Suddenly i heard many voices laughing...I woke up. (i wasnt dreaming, i really woke up, you will know the difference between really awake and dreaming) I saw many flying things above my head. I cant make out what were they. They were just faint orbs in different colors flying around, laughing. Was i afraid? yeah. I tried to sit up and yet cannot. Guess this is again the story of "ghost lying on my body" But i dont believe in those. I think my muscles are cramped or something...I struggled and finally, i am able to lift myself up. I rushed out of the room. Everyone in the house was sleeping and i didnt want to wake them up so i went back. And it happened again! I rushed out the 2nd time with no cramps in my body that time. Still i didnt want to wake my parents up. I went back, took out my bible and sleep. From then on, those things never happened again, no air-con problems and no computer problems. I'm not saying i met a ghost. Im just saying all that have happened are just wierd. Lucky for me, i always have a disbelieving attitude to these things and thus werent too afraid.<br><br>Ahh, going back to that room again tonight. Wish me luck.<br><br>------------------<br>-=^Wynternight^=-<br>None as blind or deaf as those who refuses to see or listen.</div>
