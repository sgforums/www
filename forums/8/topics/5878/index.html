Have you ever encountered those males ah... they have to open their legs so wide that they occupied 2 or 3 seats on their own. Horrible. This especially happens at the back of the bus. I mean, okay... they are guys/ men... have to open legs... BUT so WIDE? This happens on MRTs too.<br><br>I hate standing at the doorways where people alight. Because when these people are in a hurry to get off the bus, they don't care about those standing at the door (bus was already so crowded)... I lost balance a few times because they push and shove.<br><br>Getting on the bus is also another problem... some 'aunties' esp. short ones, think they are going "around the merry go round"... They go under my arm so that they can board the bus first.<br><br>Other people, they just openly cut the queue by walking right in front of you. I had this incident where this woman pushed me in order to go in front. I was unhappy about that... very unhappy.<br><br>Some Singaporeans really have no sense of civic mindedness.<br></div>
