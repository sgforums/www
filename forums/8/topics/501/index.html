            <div class='col-md body'>I agree...all guys...at least, normal guys (not those who are gays) will look at other gals even if they are attached. Come on, even gals will look at cute guys when they see one. Just like we all like to watch movies with handsome actors and pretty actresses. Aren't we looking at those pretty faces too? If a gal with big breast wears a skimpy dress walk by you and your bf, won't both of you turn and stare? I think, majority will turn and stare. Some may even give comments!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>I feel that it's ok if they only look. My bf will also look...but he'll normally ask me to look too. He'll tell me that there's a pretty gal or a gal with ultra big breast and we'll both look together. Hehe.<br>But then I have no with my bf looking at my friends. Cos my friends all say my bf dun look at them at all...they all feel he quite anti-social. They say his eyes are always on me even in front of them...he never really looked at them...so my friends all think that my bf dun even remember their faces though he have seen them a couple of times.<br>I think lah...if our bfs look at other gals whom they dunno, it's ok lah...but if they stare at our friends or have the look that they are 'stripping them with his eyes'...then I'll think that there's something fishy with his behaviour. But then different people will definitely have different opinions lah. My friend's bf is those ultra-friendly and when she brings her bf out with us, her bf not only look only at us, but he only talks to us. But my friend also accept it as it is, saying her bf is like that...very sociable.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

I mean I DO that TOO...? I even discuss about the babes (and GUYS TOO!!) with my gfs... Pretty OR ugly.... If I'm in the mood I'll comment... And I'll ask for their opinion TOO...?<br><br>I think it's still BETTER that your bf just look at other girls in front of you THAN to do things SECRETLY behind your back...? ~Sigh...~<br><br>Oh yeah.. ANOTHER thing... This is NOT 'mental cheating' as you'd described BUT HUMAN NATURE.... You CAN'T control how a person THINK...? Not to mention such things as 'mentally cheating you'.... Better drop the IDEAS before you OR your bf GO CRAZY one day...? It's just a matter of whether he wants to show (or do) what he's thinking or not... And also whether he choose to do it IN FRONT of you..... YUP... Might be HARD TO SWALLOW but EAT THIS HARD.....<br><br>------------------<br>In LIGHT I shall FEAR NOT. FOR what I AM is CUT so DEEP inside of ME.<br>I LIVE my FLESH and SOUL ONLY to BLEED for the OTHERS.<br>FEAR ME NOT. FOR I AM YOUR 'MASTER'. GIVE YOU STRENGTH. FOR YOU ARE MY 'ENEMY'.<br>DEVIL PHRASE I<br><br>I have no 'friends' nor 'family'.<br>I hold no past and see not future...<br>These are just samples of illusions....<br>I don't exist, but I shall live ETERNITY.....  DEVIL PHRASE II<br><br>ÃŸe COOL, NOT sÂ¢rrÂ¥....</div>
