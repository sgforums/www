            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ^`Angel`^BaBy:</div><div class="quote_body"> Thats very weird,funny &amp; strange...quite interesting 2....guys...i still dun understand their passion for soccer,the need 2 buy the jerseys...the way they hate 2 b dragged along 4 a shopping spree by their galfrenz...the way they bond so easily wif the same species (males)...kinda interesting....2 find out how the male brain works....</div></blockquote>Not all guys behave the same way and have the same liking like what you had implied. Not all guys like soccer, and hence have the need to buy the jerseys or talk about ManU. Maybe you might like to take in this pointer.<br><br>As for your question, well, curiousity and the pleasure of admiring beauty plus some male instinct are the answers. Most guys are attracted to pretty n sexy girl due to their male homone. That's very normal i would think or else you can call your bf as gay then maybe.<br><br>As for staring other gal openly for the gf to see, well, there might be a few obvious reason that might be related.  Firstly, the guy's mind is actually wandering around and the gf is no longer in his heart. Some communication breakdown and "zao sai" symptoms. 2ndly, the guy likes to see sexy girl in sexy outfit and his gf is not capable or willing to wear those outfit for him to admire and hence he might be staring at other girl openly as a show of his protest. 3rdly, he is caught staring at other girl when he actually mean to peep due to guy's normal instinct.<br><br>Finally, it's damn normal that guy like to see pretty and sexy girl in sexy outfit. The only thing that differ is the way he look at those girl and his mindset. Whether he is still loyal or not (zao sai symptoms) to his gf is the most important thing. Caught peeping at other girl is still ok but staring openly at other girl might mean red light in the relationship unless both the gf the guy are open-minded to this thing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Altho I think it's everyone's 2nd nature to look at pretty things, I think if guys respect their girlfriends enough, they'll try their best not to.<br>In my opinion, guys who stare at other women while their gf is next to them have no respect for his gf at all. They can stare all they want if they're alone, but to do that while in the company of their gfs means something else.<br><br>My bf used to stare, and like some of u said, even tell me about it sometimes. I was fucking mad everytime he did that and boy would he get it from me after that.<br>After such stare-and-get-the-shit-from-me incidents, and after some talking, he knows I really don't like it, so nowadays, he doesn't really. I know because I'll make an effort to walk behind him to check once in a while, and sometimes I know he does make a conscious effort not to by looking the other way so that I would not think he's staring.<br><br>It's not that I'm like so jealous or anything whenevr he stares, I mean I'll be the one who suggests we watch a certain porn movie and stuff.<br>It's a matter of respect, and 'face'. I mean what would other people think if they notice that your bf is staring at other girls?</div>
