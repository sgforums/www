            <div class='col-md body'>I never have good impression on Fujitsu though have to admit that their design really appeals to the executive.<br>I cat them as Class factor product.<br>However their quality and built isn't sturdy, doesn't give assurance of a hardy portable computer.<br><br>The Thinkpad is reputed for it's service and reliability.<br>The casing which is magnesium alloy - is only on the T and X series. Not all Thinkpads have it. Moreover, it's only the LCD portion.<br>The biggest selling point is Trackpoint and their keyboard. Sibeh shen.<br>Torture test on T &amp; X series thinkpads did also give themselves credit on the researched product.<br>Cat them as X factor product. The Classic Black is pleasing to the eye...esp with the IBM logo. Brand recongnition.<br>However, Thinkpads isn't the fastest and packed with latest products within their laptops. Still produce good results, and last longer than any others.<br><br>Sony VIAO is of cos always about the design and look good factor.<br>Lots of Sony-avail add on slots/plugins on the laptops/notebook. Marketing gimmick(?)<br>However, most of the time very disappointing performace and poor specs accompanied with good looks. (Outside nice, inside CMI)<br>What can i say? I still take a second look at whoever uses a VIAO on the street.

If you're not fending off random worm attacks, then you rely heavily on norton / acafee to maintain your system. And you need to DL updates daily.<br><br>On average, notebooks depreciate up to 5% monthly from date of purchase. Meaning in 20 months, your notebook is technically worthless. The inability to change the harddisk (without seeking manufacturer assistance) reduces the life span of your notebook as most notebook CPUs can survive longer than 3 years incident-free but not the HD. Same with items like RAM and CD-ROMs.<br><br>Desktops provide options to upgrade without dumping your notebook. Meaning you only spend say 80-100 for a new HD if the existing one crashes and there is no need to trash your system for a new one. Other things can be sold 2nd hand on hardware zone to recoup losses but no one will buy notebook parts... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Your argument on users and not notebooks are responsible for the lifespan notwithstanding, the figures are based on daily usage of 8h per user. (Done when i was a part time service tech with Dell). Average figures indicate notebook systems start to show signs of failing after 2 years. Warrenty usually covers parts replacement for 1 year. But most of the time, issues lie with overheating and not enough heat distribution away from the MB.<br><br>This is the result of cramping so many components into one Â‘economicalÂ’ package i.e. design issue. With the new centrino power saving chips, hopefully the heat output will be reduced significantly, allowing for extended lifespans for notebooks. All these issues do not affect a desktop, which offers redundancy at a fraction of the cost.<br><br>The only advantage notebooks have over desktops is mobility.<br><br></div>
