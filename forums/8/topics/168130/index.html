            <div class='col-md body'>I was quite surprised to read that there are many who have had bad experiences with COURTS. I thought I was alone.<br><br>Well, there was once when I bought a Sony Camcorder, not realising that it came with freebies as advertised in the newspapers. In actual fact, I was keen to get a cheaper model, but I was persuaded to take this one up. (Fine, my fault.. since I was easily persuaded).<br><br>To my horror, I realised that the camera came with a number of freebies, so I went over to the same branch the next day. I was told by Staff B that Staff A who attended to me the day before was off. I was actually asked to return again the next day to verify with Staff A, since he was the one who managed the transaction with me. My friend, who was there with me, was apparently more quick in thinking than me, and told the staff that we live far away, and came all the way here to pursue this matter. In the first place, it was that salesperson who forgot the freebies, etc.. etc.. Staff B finally gave up and walk away to "check", as he said..<br><br>Well, I happen to have another friend who was not with me, and he was looking around for stuff when he overheard Staff B speaking into the phone. He was heard saying, "Why did you forget the freebies? Now am I supposed to clear up the mess for you?"<br><br>Anyway, I got my freebies. But you can see how good their services are, eh? Firstly, Staff A tried to promote a camera that is more expensive (which is fine if it is truly a better model) and when I get it, he did not (or forgot) that it came with freebies as advertised. Secondly, Staff B could easily have just given me the freebies as instructed. (I had the receipt, and he checked on a PC system and could even tell which model I bought without seeing my receipt I held in my hand all along.) Instead, he tried to see if he could push the responsibility back to Staff A, and if my friend had not intervened, he would not have agreed to give the freebies to us. Of course, I have the other friend to thank for having overheard the phone conversation.<br><br>So, COURTS.. anybody who works there, or are loyal to them, any words to speak up for them?<br><br>Disgusting service...<br></div>
