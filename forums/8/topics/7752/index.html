One morning around 5am when the sky is still dark, i walk along the side of the HDB flat below and someone is dead and had a funeral there. I don't usually look at it but somehow that day something seems to be attracting me to look at it. I walking towards the photo part and had been looking at the photo for sometime and later after the photo behind is the coffin and a person is standing beside the coffin. To my horror, the person look exactly the same as in the photo. So to console myself i suppose that is his twin brother or wat.

            <div class='col-md body'>I remembered when i was young around primary school, i was got this jerky feeling just before falling to sleep.<br><br>I read in books later that this jerky feeling comes about when the body is unsuccessful in travelling to the astral world.(a dream like state).<br><br>In astral travelling, the soul leaves the body to wander around. Which is how dreams come about maybe.<br><br>Looks like i was unsuccessful in getting my soul to leave me body and wander through the nite.<br><br>------------------<br>Cheerios...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ah Dot: Astral Projection??<br>haa...my ex-sec sch had one of these books.<br><br>It teaches how your soul can leave ur body and drift anywhere you want.I tried it with friends during our sec sch days.....hee...kind of dumb.<br><br>Churra: I agreed with you. I experience the "couldnt move" thing. Most importantly you have to signal your brain that you want to move your finger or wrist. My parent said it due to your body still in sleeping mode.<br>So your brain has to wake it up.To think of it..it took me 5 ~10 mins be4 i can move.The exciting thing about this is you will feel a sudden flow of energy through ur body and u will be able to move. Hee...nice experience come to think of it...Machiam those puglistic skill "dian xue dao"<br><br>[This message has been edited by weez (edited 07 June 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There is a scientific explanation for those with feelings that they could not move and thought that they were being 'pressed' by some entity. This was believed to be caused by circumstances where our conscious brian is awake but the sub-conscious brian still sleeping.  The sub-conscious brian is the one that makes you move your body and roll when your body is hot while you sleep.<br><br>For those with sudden jerk like falling off bed, it was believed to be the 'out-of-body' experience although I have never seen a real good explanation for it.  This 'out-of-body' experience happens to be all the time....<br><br></div>
