The ox is both patient and meticulous with strong principles, and as such tends to be very stubborn. The ox is extrememly strong, and an excellent worker. However, these traits also make the ox stubborn, and their sense of self reliance makes it difficult for them to ask for or to receive assistance. Don't go looking for an evening of scintilating conversation from an ox as they are poor conversationists, and unfortunately don't have much of a sense of humour either.<br><br>Oxen are ruled by conviction, and they are not often swayed from their beliefs. The ox's ability to criticise others for their own shortcomings is well known. The ox is not very good at coping with its emotions, and can become introverted and self-destructive when they fail to find a way of expressing their feelings.<br><br>Another outward sign of the ox's self-reliance is its inability to share power, and its demand for loyalty from its friends. Born leaders, oxen work hard to achieve their goals. Unsuprisingly oxen make somewhat authoritarian parents, but are very strongly family minded. Relationships tend to be long term, and casual affairs very rare.<br><br></div>

Because of this they are often successful in their chosen careers. Tigers are excellent at seeing problems, but not so good at finding solutions. They tend to rush in without sufficient consideration. Their strong sense of independence means that they hate to take orders. Tigers often go to extraordinary lengths to prove themselves, and hate to be ignored. They are often noticed, and as such tend to rise to prominent positions. However, tigers rarely make it to the very top, preferring to be second in command.<br><br>In some Asian countries the Tiger is the national symbol (the root of the economic term 'Asian Tiger Economies'). It is believed that the tiger will protect against the three great disasters: fire, theft and evil spirits. Tigers are both brave and powerful, with a strong sense of who they are.<br><br>The tiger can be impetuous, and it is certainly a mistake to think you can push around a tiger easily. They won't shy from a fight, and their power and strength usually means that they come out on top.<br><br>Romantically, tigers are somewhat reckless, and can risk everything in pursuit of their heart's desires. As a friend they are extremely generous, and tend to give everything all at once. However, lasting friendships are few and far between.

They can be somewhat headstrong, and patience is not one of their strong points. Brave by nature, they do not shy away from danger. If riled, dogs can be vicious in their counter-attack.<br><br>The dog is a complex person, and not easily categorised, and come in all shapes and sizes. They are strongly influenced by a sense of fairness and of equality, and are often found to be promoting social reform. Indeed, most dog people will seek out injustice and fight it with every means possible. Once a dog has adopted a cause no other animal sign can equal their stubborn determination to see it through at all costs. Equality, freedom and justice are what dogs fight for.<br><br>It is not easy to win a dog's trust, but once gained, it is something that you can rely on at all times. The dog's passions are strong: just as they will be loyal and faithful to those they trust, they are unforgiving to those who cross them. If abused, a dog will feel a deep greivance, and although it may not always show on the surface, be careful of what lies beneath the surface.<br><br>Stubborn, watchful and often defensive, dogs find it hard to understand the general indifference people have to the wrongs of the world. They are quick to point out this fault, and to criticise our lack of concern for the world's injustices.<br><br>Fear of not being thought to do their best frequently causes a dog to become anxious. A dog will often speak out of turn and appear cynical at times, often unaware that those around are doing their best.<br><br>The dog's main ambition is to please. The desire to please often leads the dog to periods of anxiety, worrying that they are not doing their best. What other people think is important to a dog, and this can also lead to anxiety, and they can become very pessimistic when things aren't going well. Dogs are often materially successful, and can make large sums of money; however, their cares for the world often means that their wealth does not bring happiness, which is brought about by personal relationships.<br><br></div>

No other animal works harder or plays harder. Well informed and social, the robust and hearty pig loves company. Another great love is clothing.

At the same time they ensure that their voices are heard in debates, though only after gauging their own position first: they will not generally offer their opinion first. Having voiced their opinion the pig will take the attitude, 'take it or leave' it, and again, is not really concerned with what others think. In romance, this trait is reflected with a tendency to fall in love very quickly, often before more self-conscious people would dare to reveal their feelings. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  pretty much is there....<br><br></div></blockquote></div>
