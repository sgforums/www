He can be consider my first bf, the rest are juz puppy love.<br>Problem is, during this 3.5 yrs, we hv been quarrelling (often over small matters) quite often, however we always made up all the time. Although we love each other deeply, sometimes I feel so lost and tired of the fights that we hv.<br>I hv juz started working in July and there are many changes in my life. Now I prefer to hang out wz my frens and go clubbing than to go out wz him. We used to meet very frequently (from nearly everyday in the beginning to now only about once a week).<br>My frens hv been telling that 3 yrs is not a short time, and i should think carefully. I know that myself but sometimes I am so tired of it.<br>I feel that at this age, I need some spice in my life, but *sign*......<br>Wat should I do?<br><br>------------------<br>Who says the best LOVE will always last?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Time is not everything. No doubt 3.5 yrs is quite a long period that u've been together. But dun let this be a measurement of the depth of this relationship. And it should not be the reason that u shld stay with him.<br><br>The crucial issue is: Do u still love him?<br><br>U have to consider the fact tat u juz started out working. All those changes and the new things that u are exposed to rite now will not stay fresh and fun forever. So if the reason u wanna breakup with him is coz u wan to go out and "see the world", do think through carefully. Perhaps u can both compromise, let him take u pubbing or do something new for a change and bring the sparks back to yur relationship. Afterall, this may be juz a temporary phase u are going through.<br><br>As for the quarrels, have u ever examined the cause of it? Some couples are simply argumentative, quarreling over little things that does nothing to hurt the deep feelings they have for each other. Some even enjoy the "sparks" that flew during the arguments and esp the apologies and making up after that. However, its tiring (I know coz I used to quarrel a lot with my ex, at least once per week) in the long term. So look at the reason behind this. Is it due to the clash of personalities or difference in values. And then start resolving from there.<br><br>As a relationship develops, there's bound to be some point in time when u feel tired and want to give up. But remember this, a relationship does not only take love to survive, wat ultimately matters is tolerance. Dun give up, put in some effort and see how it goes first b4 taking any drastic actions, ok?<br><br>------------------<br>Have a break, have a TicTac...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>first, u must determine what cause u both to quarrell frequently. u're 20 and he's 28, probably some age gap (he's about time to settle down and u're probably discovering more life)<br>probably u two have to sit down and talk. communication is very important. well if both of u think the relationship has somewaht died off, please don't drag on, just because 3.5 yrs is not short</div>

At the same time, I dun want him to feel jeolous all the time. But he love me a lot and I broke up with him which till know I still regret it cos he is one of the nicest guy in the whole world interms of looks intellect and talents. I am just rash and dumb but he is still single though. But we are good frens and we still mail to each other and he even called me from SG to Canada to wish me Happy bday and sent me a present...<br><br>So what i am trying to say is, whatever u do...dun do it becos of a spur of moment but consider carefully and dun ever regret it</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, i think every relationship would have a phase where one of you get bored of it... afterall it's now stagnant, nothing new happening, so boring!!! worse still, you're going through another major change in your life, working now, and everything seems so much more exciting. but this is a major test in your relationship, and it's up to you to decide, how much you truly love her, and how deep your relationship is. tictac's post is extremely relevant ( <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">), the depth of a relationship cannot be measured by time, it's inside you, how much do you treasure this relationship? sit down and analyse everything: how much do you love him? why do you guys keep arguing? are you sick of the relationship or him?<br><br>well, you can be attracted to someone else while in a relationship, but there's a difference between attraction and love... issit possible to love another person? i don't know. *sigh*<br><br>------------------<br>I believe in the sun, even when it is not shining.<br>I believe in love, even when i do not feel it.<br>I believe in God, even when He is silent.</div>

U should stop the relationship b4 things go too deep in...where u can nevr turn back.. U r still young...be selfish to your bf but fair to u...go out and see the world and have no burden on yourself.... chase after where your heart wants to go.  I have seen 10 yrs relationship broken b4..a very very close person... at least she made the right choice.  Life is not abt symthatising other...your life is your own.  Even b4 u get any reply for this question.  I'm sure u already knoe the answer to it...u jsut want to make sure tht pples are supportinhg your answer... from the message u type regarding u get to knoe this attractive guy, i knoe tht u have already make up your decision to breakoff with him..rite? I can see tht your heart is swaying sideway noe.... This is jsut my personal opinion and no hard feeling.  SInce u already make up your mind, just do it...but Never regret with your decision for no one will knoe your wht will happen next time.  FOr the future is for u to explore.  U r always the best person to knoe wht is best for yourself.. Love is something hard to find ..some pples took along time to find it...u might be one of them..who knows...just trust in yourself..</div>

He may be the same, but you're not. What you want in a guy at 17 may not be what you want at 20. Also, your priorities, needs, and interests may have changed. If this is the reason, then you shouldn't hang on.<br><br>Then again, its very common for couples to fight. You should really examine the pattern behind your arguments. If you can compromise, then try to compromise and move on. If it's always about the same thing that neither of you want to give way in, then that's bad.<br><br>Why don't you give yourself one or two months and work really hard at the relationship first? If it doesn't work out, then maybe you should reconsider.<br><br>[This message has been edited by purr (edited 15-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I can understand your situation. I'm also 20 and I'm also in the transition stage of my life. I've just entered university and my bf is damn scared that I will run off with a guy better than him.<br>Anyway, have you seriously think: Do you still love your bf? Love has a different meaning at 18 and 20. Is it still love between the two of you or do you just feel comfortable being with your bf?<br>Or is it that you have grown up and your bf has yet to accept it? Or do you just feel the need for attention from other guys?<br>Basically, the above questions are the questions I asked myself when my heart starts to stray. [better not elaborate on this in case my bf sees it]. There are lots of talented, smart, good-looking,etc... guys in university and everytime I think of the questions and analysed what I was feeling, I found out that I still love my bf so much.<br>Maybe you can try my method... use your heart to think to get the answer  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Dun care about the years you had with him.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This really sounds like what happened to 2 of my good friends. Their gfs believed that they have to experience more so they broke up with my friends. I don't know if the girls grew to regret or celebrate their decision.<br><br>I could say that this would not be a good reason to end a relationship, but deeper down I feel that when you are going through life, shit happens.<br><br>I was reading this article about this woman describing an affair that she had while she was married and still in love with her husband. Yes, she still loved her husband and her children very much when she was having the affair. She ended by saying that the affair ruined her marriage and life after that, but that one year affair was the happiest time that she had and ever did have in her life.<br><br>Like previous posters, I think you should think over it and evaluate things deeply. No one can promise you that the decision that you make will make you happy, but thats a risk that you have to take. In fact, you might grow stronger and wiser because of it, even if that means that you have to bear a deep scar for the rest of your life because of that. I'm bringing up the story just to show that there is an irony in the way we feel and the way things turn out.<br><br>If you really do go with the younger guy I hope you do it after making things clear with your current bf.<br><br>As a guy, I do understand ( or will understand eventually) that thats how people are. Shit happens. Ultimately, you have to look out for yourself even though to others you might seem selfish.<br><br>Stepping on 2 boats at the same time is what I'll have difficulty accepting as a bf.<br><br>I hope things work out.<br><br>[This message has been edited by pacman (edited 15-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If he really loves you, and you really wished to go, he'll let you go. If he doesn't love you that deeply, he'll not be able to understand why you want to go, and hence you wouldn't have to worry about hurting him 'cos he'll only be feeling sorry for himself.<br>But before you decide to let go, I guess it's better for you to sort out your thoughts first. Ask yourself whether you loved him enough to stick through thick and thin for life, or has your feelings swayed. If it's the latter, try to figure out why it happened. If it's because the love you professed it's not strong enough to be eternal, you might not have find the right one yet. If it's vice-versa, you know what to do.<br><br>Don't be hasty in your decision, and once you made up your mind, be firm with it. Do not regret your decision.<br><br>Hope this will enlighten you and hope you'll make the right decision.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Juzme, can I ask you something... are you feeling a little bored(with the relationship), and feel like going out to have some fun. But you're afraid that it may hurt your current bf, or that you will never be able to find someone as suitable in future?<br><br>better ask yourself clearly what you're thinking, then make your decision. If the result is a breakup, it will definitely hurt him, but I believe the fact that u've hurt him will also hurt you... that is something that you hv to weigh.<br><br>Maybe you want to hv some fun while you're young while your bf is already 28 and wants to settle down? I think its your duty to tell him that you do not want to settle down yet(if u really think so!), and if both cannot see eye to eye on this, maybe this will be a breakup scenario.<br><br>I mean people may love each other dearly, but come to the ultimate decision, there are many things that requires compromise... I hv experience with this when deciding on where to stay with my gf, and we were close to quarreling many times over the same issue(we seldom quarrel, if at all). This makes me understand that though people may love each other dearly, many things can still lead to breakup, like one want to get married and the other do not want, etc.<br><br>Think carefully...  take care!<br><br>------------------<br>Whens the end coming? Like asif I care.....<br><br></div>
