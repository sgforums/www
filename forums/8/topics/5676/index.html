            <div class='col-md body'>Finally I am able to find some time to write<br>briefly about this. I repeat, briefly,<br>eastern philosophy has been dealing with this<br>topic for centuries and no conclusive<br>conclusions have been reached. It is not a<br>topic that can be covered in just one post.<br><br>Let us first understand monism and dualism<br>first. Monism is a philosophic equipoise that<br>purports that all things, in whatever<br>variety, can be reduced to one unified thing<br>in space, time or quality. Dualism is the<br>philosophic equipoise that purports that all<br>things consist of 2 components, mind and the<br>object being perceived.<br><br>Eastern philosophy itself is highly<br>fragmented and diverse in its views. I will<br>try to describe from the point of views of<br>3 main eastern philosophies, buddhism,<br>hinduism and taoism.<br><br>Before I go into describing, I have to once<br>again reiterate, western philosophic<br>arguments rest upon clear logical<br>demarcation, and its argument style stems<br>directly from that motivation. Eastern<br>philosophy has a different motivation, and<br>therefore you may notice that the way I<br>describe Eastern philosophy will not fit<br>the normal protocol western academics<br>describe western philosophy.<br><br>Buddhist point of view does not fall into<br>such clearly divided lines - monism vs<br>dualism. Madhyamikan (a buddhist philosophic<br>school) demarcation perhaps is a better way<br>to describe it to people trained under the<br>western philosophic tradition. Madhyamikans<br>propose 2 types of existence, inherent<br>existence and conventional existence.<br><br>Inherent existence - entity exists on its<br>own rights.<br><br>Conventional existence - that entities, on<br>the perception level, exist.<br><br>The buddhist position on this, is that<br>entities do not have inherent existence -<br>that it requires a mind (for example) for<br>the entity to exist. That everything exists<br>only in the web of interconnectedness of<br>relationships (if there is no ear to listen<br>to a voice, does the voice exist or not?).<br><br>However, to deny all inherent existence is<br>nihilistic, and that is not the position of<br>buddhism. To account for human perception of<br>entities, madhyamikans propose that entities<br>conventionally exist, but do not inherently<br>exist.<br><br>In short, buddhist point of view can neither<br>be classified under monism nor dualism. I<br>shall refrain from talking more, buddhism is<br>an art, a way of life, hardly something which<br>can be intellectualized.<br><br>Taoist point of view is clearly non<br>dualistic (though I will not go far to say<br>that it is monistic either), or rather<br>I would say that Taoists would not even<br>intellectualize upon the matter. It is clearly<br>exemplified in chapter 2 of Chuang Tzu,<br>where Chuang Tzu remarks after a dream<br>about being a butterfly, that he does not<br>know whether he is a butterfly dreaming that<br>he is a man, or that he is a man dreaming<br>that he is a butterfly. An important point<br>to note is that he behaves as he is expected<br>to be, unheld by all intellectual restriction<br>and comtemplation (is he a butterfly or a<br>man?)<br><br>A taoist mind seeks to harmonize with his<br>world. Living according to the world's rules<br>and does not seek to change it, or even to<br>intellectualize upon it. Taoism is an<br>exemplary example of anti intellectualism.<br>What is dualism and monism to a taoist?<br><br>A hindu mind can be naively seen as being<br>dualistic (hinduism is highly complex, there<br>are opposing views, even within hinduism<br>itself). Bhagavad Gita purports a view in<br>which spiritual enlightenment is a process<br>in which one's soul is being cleanse of all<br>evil thoughts.<br><br>However, that view is highly naive and if you<br>read more deeply into Hinduism, you will find<br>that Brahma somehow acts as a conciliatory<br>principle to both dualistic elements, vishnu<br>and shiva. How Brahma acts as a conciliatory<br>principle to neutralise the dualism, forgive<br>me, I am not that learned yet to understand<br>it, or have even given it enough thought.<br><br>With this, I think I shall end. I do not know<br>much on how to conclude this subject matter,<br>since eastern philosophic views are so<br>diverse. But one thing for sure, eastern<br>philosophic views are not based on strict<br>logical demarcations that western tradition<br>has subjected itself to.</div>
