            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>About several days ago.....early in the morning, while the sky was still dark, I was lying in my bed, trying to sleep (I had insomnia and couldnt sleep proper schedule). Then, I heard some noise coming from the main door area.<br><br>I was puzzled by the noise, and I was thinking, could it be an intruder?<br><br>I wanted to just ignore it. But I couldnt. I was the only man in the house. My Dad was overseas and my bro was staying in a dorm outside. My mom and sisters were sleeping in other rooms. If it was really an intruder, robber, or etc, then my mom and sisters would be in danger. As the only man of the house, and as the only one awake, I had to act. I decided to check the noise.<br><br>I got up and searched for some weapons. Unfortunately, my bedroom didnt have any good weapons. I found an object, but I dont know how to describe it in English. It is like a cleaning object made of palm leaf ribs grouped together.<br><br>I grabbed this object, then I readied myself. I opened my bedroom door quickly, rushed out, then looked everywhere. There was nobody.<br><br>My mom and sisters were still sleeping.<br><br>Thinking it was nothing, I went back to bed again.<br><br>After a few minutes, the sounds came again. This time, I grew more suspicious. What kind of noise was that? How come got another noise?<br><br>Thinking that it might really be an intruder, again I grabbed my object, then at that moment, I felt really useless. I was thinking how to win against an intruder with such a lousy weapon. But no choice, that was all I had.<br><br>Again, I opened my bedroom door quickly, rushed out, ready to fight, and looked everywhere. There was nobody. I checked my main door. It was still locked. I checked the windows. Still locked too.<br><br>I went back to bed. I was quite dissapointed with myself. I was behaving like a total idiot who got fooled by silly noise, I thought.<br><br>After a few minutes, there was some noise again. This time, I really highly suspect there must be an intruder outside, otherwise who made the noise until 3 times like that?<br><br>Again, I grabbed my object, rushed out from my bedroom. There was nobody. I looked outside the windows, there was nobody outside too.<br><br>I went back to bed. I was confused and puzzled, thinking what caused the noise? Really strange.<br><br>I tried to go to sleep.<br><br>After a few minutes, again some noise came from the main door area. This time, my mind told me, no need to check it out. It sure would be nothing. I tried to ignore it and tried to sleep. However, I couldn't. As I said before, I was the only one awake, and the only man in the house, so I had to protect the rest, in case what if it was really an intruder? My mind told me to just check it out for one more time. It's better to be safe than sorry. So OK, I got up from bed, did the same things.......<br><br>Again...nobody...<br><br>I went back to bed again and feeling quite pissed because by that time the sky is getting brighter, it is almost morning liao. My sleep schedule was upside down.<br><br>Moral of the story: U must buy a baseball bat and keep it under ur bed. In case u need a good weapon to fight an intruder.<br><br>For me, I definitely will buy a baseball bat. I had the experience of feeling useless and cant protect my family when I only had palm leaf ribs.</div>

If it is forged by machine, maybe. If it handcrafted by the blacksmiths, then shd be quite tough.<br>Some of my Fantasy swords are so large and long (abt 1.35 m), the blade have warped a little due to the weight of the designs of teh handle (Carvings of knights, skull etc.) when I left them with the tip of the blade stabbed into the thick styrofoam. But most of them are liking to chip off when strike against another sharp blade. So save it to slash flesh, not wall.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the title of the topic should be "I grabbed my object" instead of "funny sounds at home". it fits much better.<br><br>seriously, wtf dude, is the theme of your little story about grabbing your object? you said that for like at least 10 times. and the story has no Fucking ending, we all know stories with no endings really suck. so I suggest in the last paragraph of your story, you conclude with "I grabbed my object, for the last time."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>its caused by the expansion and contraction of the steel and concrete. when the steel and concrete expand and contract they produce the furniture moving sound.  also sometimes maybe particles drop or due toe xpansion and contraction they produce a sort of click sound which then echos back and forth in the empty spaces between the floors..causing the "marble dropping" sound. hope that helps explain it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
