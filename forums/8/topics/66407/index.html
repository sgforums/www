Especially in Singapore, where people lives in fast paced life, and children grew up with poor socialising skills or had not gone thru social etiquette teachings, ( hey having many friends doesnt mean your socialising skils are good, maybe it means you know how to buaya onli  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ). Without greater intelligent socialisation among our youngs, tendency is we are not street smart, and cannot discern a smile from a mock, a sarcasm from a joke.<br><br>Singapore is somewhat a friendly city, but I wouldnt vote it one of teh top friendliest city. Just that our life in SG made us more mechanical than human. We do socialise, but we are not socialising with skills and intelligence, and maybe without good etiquette too. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Actually can blame on our lack of social culture and graciousness lah...... So, without knowing whats good, whats bad, tendency for people is to be negative towards other intention or character (already a pervasive traits in us now, judging by some threads in sgforums), so even if we are really nice guy, our intentions are always misread.<br><br>Does that mean the end???Gasp, no lah......within my tight circle of friends, they know my integrity and honesty and my other traits or mood hehe, those who chose to put me down, I dont owe them a living, so in fact, who cares....hehe<br><br>Its the friendship, the bond and support from close friends that counts for me. I dont care who outside my circle of friends chose to put me down or dismiss me as anoher uninteresting snob. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
