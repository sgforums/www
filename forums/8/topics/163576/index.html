One need to travel to appreciate spore more when one come back <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>However there is one major advantage living in town. Almost stress free and very idle and slow pace of life. Can even see live chickens, rubber trees, mamak stalls, night markets etc. Good for recharging batteries so as to go back spore to fight tooth and nail for money again hahaha....</div></blockquote>I agree with you on this... sometimes one need to stay in small towns to appreciate for the better... then when we move on to better places, we would bring that appreciation with us and not take things for granted...<br><br>There are even places in Penang where there is hardly any concrete buildings, only kampungs and huts... I was once from there when I was a small kid. It was off Bayan Lepas, and the place is still the same even though I have left it for so many years...</div>

Towns like Yong Peng, Labis, Chaah, Tengah, Segamat etc all cannot find cinema. Even if have also closed shop already.
