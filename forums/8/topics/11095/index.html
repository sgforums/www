            <div class='col-md body'>I knew it after I had broken up with my girl. He wrote the letter to her while I was still with her..several months earlier. So I really don't know if I was lucky ...sigh...<br>He has now divorced his wife ....I really don't know how I got into this mess.<br>We used to have so much fun together. Now all of us are seperated. sigh.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Lightspeed (edited 02 February 2001).]</div>
