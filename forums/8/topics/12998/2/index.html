            <div class='col-md body'>Whole Preview of the show .: Spoiler .:<br>It started really bastardly boring... About a housekeeper, Gardener and a Mute bitchy slut.... They went to that many rooms house. The 'owner' there was a women with 2 children. The children can't be exposed to too much lights, due to some affections on skins... (Actually not true). That women there was a Sluty Christians Jesus lover. He makes her children study the bible, and she believes in it...<br>Here comes the twist, Ann was the sister (oldest among she and her brother), She said she met a boy named Victor in the house. but, her mother doesn't belives, in the end... The mother finds out the house is haunted...<br>She took her ultimate rifle, searching the room for ghost. But no result, desperatly, She went off to find the priest, But restricted by Fog. By coincidence, he found his long lost husband who fought in war. They went back to the house again, and after having sex, the husband left.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br>The children needs a father, so they went off to the woods to find their father. Soon, they found graves of the House keeper, the gardener and the bitchy mute. By instant, they knew they were already dead, the 2 children quickly ran back to the house. The mother also saw the picture of the 3 servants....<br><br>What Happened?<br>Actually, Everyone is dead! The parents, the children, and the 2 old ppl + the mute. The mother had already killed the children, and kill herself. The father was dead in war, and his soul had returned to the house. The housekeeper, Gardener and Mute wasn't actually what they seems to be. They were actually living in the house long before them, and were dead. They wanted to tell the mother and the children that they were dead, and to accept the truth. Because the mother was adapted to christians, bibles, and the lord... They couldn't believe there were ghost... And she didn't realise or believe she was already dead. According to the story, the only living ppl were victor's family. Victor realised there's ghost, so they invited a medium (known as witch) old women to investigate....<br><br>As why Ann suddenly turned old is because she had gone into that meduim's body...<br><br>My Rate: B-      Scream points: 30/100<br>Conclude: Not scary if you know nobody will be harm.<br><br>------------------<br>Espresso: A small but potent coffee served black. Characterised by a flavour and aroma so intense they bite. The perfect Espresso can be created by forcing water at 9 bar pressure and 88Â°C through a tightly compact wad of 8 grams of freshly ground coffee beans, producing 1.7 fluid oz. of coffee in exactly 22 seconds.<br><br>Cappuccino: A decadent combination of real Espresso smoothed out with equal quantities of steamed and frothed milk creating a luxurious cap that can be garnished with chocolate or cinnamon powder.<br><br>Mocha: A delicious medley of pure Espresso and real chocolate sauce. Filled with steamed milk and crowned with a swirl of whipped cream and chocolate powder for a rich indulgent chocolate experience.<br><br>37.5 Degree human.<br>Sukoru Reonhato - manager of  <a href="http://Sukoru.cjb.net&lt;br%20/&gt;">http://Sukoru.cjb.net<br></a>   ICQ at 79520479</div>
