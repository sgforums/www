            <div class='col-md body'>Radical space propulsion: warp drive for real?<br><br>An odd story. The New Scientist is fairly well respected, so I would guess that somebody is at least looking into it. What is the chance that one discarded theory from the 1950's---well string theory and even quarks---and undoubtably far outside the mainstream of physics is correct?<br><br>In truth, the chance is extremely low. But the import is sufficiently high to look.<br><br>I looked on the New Scientist web site: the hyperdrive story is available only to paid subscribers.<br><br>-----------------------------------------------<br>http://news.scotsman.com/scitech.cfm?id=16902006<br><br>Welcome to Mars express: journey time three hours<br>IAN JOHNSTON SCIENCE CORRESPONDENT<br><br>AN EXTRAORDINARY "hyperspace" engine that could make interstellar space travel a reality by flying into other dimensions is being investigated by the United States government.<br><br>The hypothetical device, which has been outlined in principle but is based on a controversial theory about the fabric of the universe, could potentially allow a spacecraft to travel to Mars in three hours and journey to a star 11 light years away in just 80 days, according to a report in today's New Scientist magazine.<br><br>The theoretical engine works by creating an intense magnetic field that, according to ideas first developed by the late scientist Burkhard Heim in the 1950s, would produce a gravitational field and result in thrust for a spacecraft.<br><br>Also, if a large enough magnetic field was created, the craft would slip into a different dimension, where the speed of light is faster, allowing incredible speeds to be reached. Switching off the magnetic field would result in the engine reappearing in our current dimension.<br><br>The US air force has expressed an interest in the idea and scientists working for the American Department of Energy - which has a device known as the Z Machine that could generate the kind of magnetic fields required to drive the engine - say they may carry out a test if the theory withstands further scrutiny.<br><br>Professor Jochem Hauser, one of the scientists who put forward the idea, told The Scotsman that if everything went well a working engine could be tested in about five years.<br><br>However, Prof Hauser, a physicist at the Applied Sciences University in Salzgitter, Germany, and a former chief of aerodynamics at the European Space Agency, cautioned it was based on a highly controversial theory that would require a significant change in the current understanding of the laws of physics.<br><br>"It would be amazing. I have been working on propulsion systems for quite a while and it would be the most amazing thing. The benefits would be almost unlimited," he said.<br><br>"But this thing is not around the corner; we first have to prove the basic science is correct and there are quite a few physicists who have a different opinion.<br><br>"It's our job to prove we are right and we are working on that."<br><br>He said the engine would enable spaceships to travel to different solar systems. "If the theory is correct then this is not science fiction, it is science fact," Prof Hauser said.<br><br>"NASA have contacted me and next week I'm going to see someone from the [US] air force to talk about it further, but it is at a very early stage. I think the best-case scenario would be within the next five years [to build a test device] if the technology works."<br><br>The US authorities' attention was attracted after Prof Hauser and an Austrian colleague, Walter Droscher, wrote a paper called "Guidelines for a space propulsion device based on Heim's quantum theory".</div>
