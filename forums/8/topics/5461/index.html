            <div class='col-md body'>Yup! Some girls go clubbing for the obvious reason - pick up or get picked up by a good looking guy and get laid.  Three years ago,  when my friends and I were going clubbing on Richard St. (Vancouver Canada), there was this really good looking girl that my friends' friend (Chris) manage to pick up. I am not surprised, since Chris is tall (over 6 ft.) and very good looking himself. Hardly see any Oriental guys as good looking as him!  No! I am not gay!  Shortly later, he and the girl left the club while we were still there eyeing on other girls. Later, I heard that the girl and him had a one night stand.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sad to say, but must agree with firewire had said...chio gals r social creatures. No offense, gals, just wanna to say how I feel..yah rite..they sure like to show off al rite. The same applied to the guys too. It's part of human's nature. It's sad to say that in this society, we r bounded by so many materialistic needs, like cash, dark desires.....</div>

The way she danced.....boy i think she was the one which told the Oxford dictionary guys what gyrate meant.<br><br>Back to the point, errr......actually I have none, just wanted to agree with the topic *hyak hyak*<br><br></div>
