You can also use white stickers to mask the small part.<br>Make sure the paint is dry already before you do masking. if you are not sure whether the paint has completely dried,  do this first: stick the stickers to clothes and peel them off. Repeat this untill the sticky part no longer feel very sticky. Then mask the small part. This so that the white sticker will not get too sticky and peel of the paint on the model.<br><br>Next cover the model with newspaper, only exposing the small part. You can use scotch tapes or masking tapes if you want to stick the newspaper togther.<br>Then you can continue to use the spray paint.<br><br>This is what I did, saved me a lot of money buying the compressor.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rapture (edited 05 February 2002).]</div>
