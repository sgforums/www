It ends with massive destruction of civilization.  Pain and suffering, death and broken families, dejection and suicide, even more deathsÂ…  Anything but the cause!  The poignant memories are but buried deep in the minds of those who suffered.  The wound is never healed, but forgotten Â– the era of Â“peace and tranquilityÂ”.  Not by the agonized survivors facing the torture afflicted upon them, but by their offspring, and those consumed by greed and power.<br><br>Words can be mighty, as much as an authoritative religion.  Such are the illusions of followers blinded by faith or belief, commencing with a self-righteous sanctimonious cause, while concluding with either dejection, or delusions of grandeur, believing they have achieved what they wanted, when it has in fact slipped through their fingers.  It was once there, but we fought to lose it.<br><br>Till one sees through the fallacy, history repeats itself.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Asure (edited 28 July 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Your post striked me with some thoughts over the recent Camp David talks in US. I was actually been following on the Israel-Palestine issue for the past few days. It is really disappointing that both leaders need to bow to fundamentalists (the left wing) and not make a historic breakthrough. I really do not understand the Israeli and Palestinians, how much more blood would they want to spill in order to stop? Two thousand years of bloodshed and war just could not be brought to an end.<br><br>The Middle East is still the firepoint which war could easily break out because of its fragile and volatile state relations. I was debating with my college friends on a motion that it is right to die for your religion. One of the interesting points which is brought up in the debate, was the definition of Jihad. Jihad has been used as a cliche so often to denote Holy War, but if one bothers to check, it means striving all for the cause of Allah.<br><br>We could not prevent the outbreak of wars, the pitfalls of human failure because of natural selection. A civilization which do not seek to expand and close its borders, turn inwards would definitely collapse. It is witnessed in ancient civilzations like Rome, Babylon, Mongol Empire and etc.<br><br>*sigh at the world affairs of today*<br><br>yours<br>Prodigal<br><br>------------------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well atreiu, that war brings technological advancements is undeniable, however don't you think war consumes resources that could otherwise be spent on more constructive activities? For example, the money spent in building and maintaining nuclear weapons could be used to for some other more constructive research.<br><br>In the past, we have fought with swords and horses. Today, we fight with missiles and weapons of mass destruction. The last 5 decades have only made these weapons far more destructive than ever (the hydrogen bomb, for example can cause many, many more times the damage than the nuclear bomb could ever do).<br><br>All it takes is just one madman in one of the 5 nuclear states to trigger off a world-wide cataclysm. The holocaust of Hiroshima and Nagasaki would seem like a non-event compared to what we would face with today's weapons. No amount of technological advancement can ever justify that.<br></div>

After all, having a war is the greatest equality man can have and Darwin will be pleased to know that his evolution theory is full applied by his fellow human beings. Come forumities, imagine for a moment we had a deep grievances against another set of neighbours. We think they are uncouth and frankly, cavemen. What do we do? First, we declare war, or go about the sneaky way of the Japanese ala Pearl Harbour and we EXTERMINATE them. Every one of them, man, woman, children and old folks. Why? Because we are a superior species and what we are doing is only hastening the evolutionary process. I mean, seriously, who wants these bunches of uncouth cavemen around? By the way, as a fringe benefit of doing that cleansing from our backyard, we are also getting rid of extra trash that feeds on our resources.

For example, the money spent in building and maintaining nuclear weapons could be used to for some other more constructive research.<br><br>In the past, we have fought with swords and horses. Today, we fight with missiles and weapons of mass destruction. The last 5 decades have only made these weapons far more destructive than ever (the hydrogen bomb, for example can cause many, many more times the damage than the nuclear bomb could ever do).<br><br>All it takes is just one madman in one of the 5 nuclear states to trigger off a world-wide cataclysm. The holocaust of Hiroshima and Nagasaki would seem like a non-event compared to what we would face with today's weapons. No amount of technological advancement can ever justify that.</div></blockquote>But Arafel, look at it this way, the seeds of technology, that grow into the so called weapons of mass destruction, what are they? Nuclear fusion, Nuclear fission etc. When the technology arose, you think that (was it? ) Einstein meant for it to be used as a weapon? Of course not! Just as research into the unknown brings with it the fruits of the technology unearthed, how else would weapons of mass destruction evolve too? Are you saying we should then go back to the Stone Age, back to primitive ways of club and stone just because I'm scared a missile will drop right on me?  Come on, watched X-Men yet? somewhere along the show, this comes up " A driver in a car is not dangerous unless he choooses to be so"  The keyword is choice.<br><br>War is a black mark in the history of humanity, we fight amongst our species with such aplomb as compared to  other speices in this small world of ours. Why fight? tet says is good for over-population problems, lets put it this way, it ELIMINATES the bad apples don't you think. Yes, we don't need Saddam, Hitler, etc, hoe to get rid? WAR! Yes at the cost of a lot of innocents, but it has to be.<br><br>Picture this, if say Earth were a peaceful society. No wars no hate. think is possible? Insert just one bad seed into the population. this seed, call him X, is not happy. he wants for power to himself. he;s sick of the everyone is equal propaganda. how? he begins to craft weapons of mass destruction. and then proceeds to take over a hapless world.<br><br>"for every foe, there will always be a hero to vanquish it"</div>
