            <div class='col-md body'>eh... this thread is not exactly about peace-keeping, which is certainly difficult, if not impossible (though it also serves to discredit the so called Â“heroesÂ” and protagonists of war).<br><br>More often that not, we have to choose between 2 options (2, for the sake of a less intricate scenario).  Either one may lead to disastrous conclusions.  Whether the Â“validityÂ” of both acts of iniquity is measured by means of faith/religion or personal ethics, both are difficult choices.<br><br>For instance, should a war be raised against another country, should we know that the country in question has great potential to cause a worldwide catastrophe that would endanger the entire human race, and any delay would cause that to happen?  This may provide enough justification to some to bear the consequences of warfare.  But in that case, are we being fair by giving ourselves, and not the others, the benefit of the doubt?  Will this set a precedent in future wars to come?<br><br>Similarly, if one is to sell his soul to the devil in exchange for the ability to heal and cure all illnesses, so as to alleviate the pain and suffering of people, should he be condemned, or be placed at the pinnacle in the hearts of all, where honor should be?<br><br>In life you usually never have to choose between good and evil, the truth and a lie. You have to choose most of the time between two evils, two lies, and you have to ponder in your soul and mind, in your human and religious responsibility, to know which evil and which lie are worse and then decide to support the least evil and the least vicious lie, and then your Â« lying Â» is between you and your soul, between you and your ethics, between you and your God, if you believe in God.  Ultimately, you have to come to terms with yourself.<br><br>This is in a way pessimistic about society that can only move on from lesser lie to lesser lie, from lesser evil to lesser evil. Society improves because the lesser lies and evils are chosen by the men and women who have some kind of humane and humanistic inspiration, based on personal ethics or on their religious beliefs.<br><br>This is how ugly life can be at times and how we have to react with our souls, minds, thinking and intelligence, rather than with a pre-constructed code of behavior or a set of pleasure-directed spontaneous feelings. God always forgive a lie if it reveals some evil and enables our human society to correct this evil and hence improve.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, Asure,<br><br>There exists two forms of morality in my opinion, some common values which we share like "Killing is bad" and the other set of values which is conditioned by the society. How does that come into the picture?<br><br>In war, there is no good or bad side. In the definition of Clausewitz, the aim of a war is impose control on the other state, and compel the other state to her biding, whereas in Sun Tzu, war is necessary only because we need to survive. Survival and Controlling of other people are the primarily motives of war, and in the modern world, people try to wage war not by weapons but by capitalism and invasion of cultures, for example, Starbucks and Macs is in every city and every town...<br><br>Nobody would want to go into a full scale war, because if one thinks properly, no one actually wins in the war. We lost people, we lost infrastructure, and we incurred damages on both sides which is not repairable in terms of relationship between states in many years to come.<br><br>In regards to your lesser evil, here is my conclusion about people today, like some hypocrites who I encountered in my life. Nowadays, there exist so many conceited people who go about in society, pretending to be good, who are in fact naive and tedious. I begin to think it shows rather a sweet and modest disposition to pretend to be bad. I would not say that I am a decent guy, since I have been bad before. I would just say that I am a simple person with so and so values, and not morals. If you pretend to be good, the world takes you very seriously, and once you fall, you are condemned forever. If you pretend to be bad, it doesn't. Such is the astounding stupidity of optimism. I am afraid that good people do a lot of harm in this world by labeling evil to such extraordinary importance. It is nonsensical to split people between good and bad. People are either charming or tedious. I prefer to be tolerant towards people's beliefs with the phrase that it may not be what you believe, it does not make it wrong. There is still honor, only whether you want to uphold it.<br><br>yours,<br>Prodigal<br><br></div>
