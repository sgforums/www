            <div class='col-md body'>One day a father of a very wealthy family took his son on a trip to the countryside with the firm purpose of showing his son how poor people live..<br><br>They spent a couple of days and nights on the farm of what would be considered a very poor family.. on their return from the trip, the father asked his son,<br><br>"How was the trip?"<br><br>" It was great, Dad."<br><br>"Did you see how poor people live?" the father asked.<br><br>"Oh yeah," said the son.<br><br>"So, tell me, what did you learn from the trip?" asked the father..<br><br>The son answered: "I saw that we have one dog and they had four.. We have a pool that reaches to the middle of our garden and they have a creek that has no end.. we have imported lanterns in our garden and they have the<br>stars at night..<br><br>Our patio reaches to the front yard and they have the whole horizon.. We have a small piece of land to live on and they have fields that go beyond<br>our sight.. we have servants who serve us, but they serve others.. We buy our food, but they grow theirs..<br><br>We have walls around our property to protect us, they have friends to protect them." The boy's father was speechless.. Then his son added,<br><br>"Thanks, Dad, for showing me how poor we are."<br><br>Isn't perspective a wonderful thing? Makes you wonder what would happen if we all gave thanks for everything we have, instead of worrying about what we don't have..<br><br>Appreciate every single thing you have, especially<br><br>your family and friends!<br></div>

Lets face the reality here. The richer you are,  you will get more choices in life. You will have a greater opportunity to experice fully what the world has to offer. You can travel around the world if you like, experience different culture, taste different food, get to play with snow and meet different people. Your life is not restricted by your environment. If you feel your life's aim is to help other people, you can get involved in charity work or so on. You don't have to worry whether you can afford to pay for your family's medical bills. Their health is ensured by the fact that they have access to the best health care. Ultimately whether your life is good or not, it is up to the choices you make.<br><br>However, most people are not so fortunate. Their choices in life are restricted by the circumstances in which they are born into.  If their child fall sick, there is little they can do. If the community in which they live in discriminates them just because they do not "fit in", they have noone to turn to. Their lives are subjected to those of higher authority or sometimes by nature. Crop disease, flood, drought, animal disease. No food.<br><br>I think we should be grateful for what we have achieved. And not do the typical Singaporean behavior of comparing and competing with others. Bigger does not mean better. More does not lead to greater happiness. A a creek is not better than a pool and more dogs do not give you better satisfaction. Be thankful for the freedom that has been given to us.</div>
