So far most of the casusalties outside the bars are those who took a flaming lamborghini... esp, after already gulping down some other stuff before.<br><br>Trance is ok, but not the Ah-Beng tendency type. Breakbeat Techno and Electronica are the way to go man.. and for some slow slacking, Trip Hop rulez.. Massive Attack, Prodigy, The Curve, Vitro, Leftfield, Method Man, Chemical Brothers.... sounds of the future.<br><br>Retro ain't for dancing... it never was, and never will be. It's pass its time. Vengaboys-type techno can go take a hike too... and stop that "Oo oo oo oo oo oo oo" sound that the bengs always make... its disgusting.<br><br>They should have more places like Phuture and Nox.. scrap all those cheena hangouts.. dajie, mdm wong, wong san... what's with all the cheesy names man??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Only thing good at those places?

            <div class='col-md body'>Err... this might be a piece of old info. but wat the heck....<br>I think Ice Cold Beer has the cheapest beer in Orchard area...at least. 2 bottles of Carlsberg Ice can be bought for $10.00. I mean, where can u find such good price in a pub/club anywhere else in Singapore. Forsters are $20.00 for 3!'enuff said. Ice Cold Beer: huge variety of bottled beer, extra long hotdog to savour, relaxed atmosphere, cheap beer and of course pool tables at the second floor.<br><br>Predominately, retro music has been the so called resident choice of music along Mohd. Sultan. Can't blame the club owners though being the fact that retro music brings in crowds. Majority of the crowd would rather listen and dance to the tunes of yesterdays which definitely has vocals(which they can sing along to it while dancing), catchy melodys and hooks. Compares to other genres of dance music: house/progressive house, deep trance, big/break/progressive beats, garage, drum'n'bass, etc....all these eletronic stuff definitely won't ring a bell to them. The latter has less vocal arrangements, more bassline/ percussive driven. It's not everyones cup of tea, but like retro music....once you are exposed to it for sometime, u will find it more intriguing, uplifting than the standard retro fare. Dun forget dance music is always revolving in other genres but retro music....well it's retro isn't it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Proper dance clubs which dish out real proper music(no euro-techno here at Sparks &amp; such): Zouk/Phuture and Nox</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys, dun be like this lah! Plz stop cursing all those NS guys and retro music.<br>Unless u are a foreigner or a chao sissy who is a clerk during ur NS days, be stop complaining abt them. Didn't u during ur NS days luv to get out of camp at every opportunity and go chiong somewhere? And then after tat hope to get pass the guard commander at the gate?<br>And for retro..most ppl in Singapore started out chionging with those kind of music. After they grow up, they graduate into other kinds of music like house. Most of us start out with retro. So plz stop cursing retro as thought u look damn cool by not associating urself with it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jack O Daniels:<br>Personally, retro music is fine. I've been to Zouk's Mambo Jumbo rocking to thier blend of retro music during my NS days. But to think about listening to Rick Ashtley, Bannarama, Depeche Mode, Baltimore(square room) over and over again kinda make me realize I should start putting on a pair of tapered pants and jacket with an 80's atitude to top up with it.<br>For me, it's a natural progression....moving on...exploring/exposing to new genres of music.<br></div>
