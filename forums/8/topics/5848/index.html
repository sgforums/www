Or you can just hang around the counter and play with your hair until someone buys you a drink. Happens often.<br><br>Can't help you with the other questions. I'll check out SOS next time.

            <div class='col-md body'>Normally I'd take Vodka Sprite, or Gin Coke, both are quite nice and relatively weak.<br>As for SOS, I've not been there. But if you want a few recommendations of cool places, well, here goes:<br><br>1.) Club Samsara. Along Mohammed Sultan, 1 of the few there with age limit at 18. The crowd is young, and mainly retro is played. It's rather happening, though it's kinda small, coz the place is long and narrow.<br><br>2.) Zouk. Well, need I say more?<br><br>3.) Lan Kwai Fong. It's a really authentic place if you just wanna find a place to chill out without so much dancing. There's even food there.<br><br>4.) Venom. At Pacific Plaza. It's a rather happening place too, but well, unless you're the alternative type, don't go on Sundays. ( designated gays' night)<br><br>5.) Sunset Bay/ Pink Flamingo. Sentosa, Siloso Beach. This is what I find very refreshing for a change. The crowd there is very fun-loving, and the stuff are very friendly too. After partying, you can still spend the night at the beach. Really wonderful.<br><br>If you're looking for more places, try searching at <a href="http://www.catcha.com.sg" rel="nofollow">www.catcha.com.sg</a>     .  Search under Entertainment, and click on nightspots.<br>That should give you an almost exhaustive list of hangout places in Singapore. Cheers to partying!<br>=)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess the writing has been up on the wall for me a long time. Reading this thread actually made me shake my head in wistful disbelief at the vigour and naivette of youth.<br><br>Frankly, I can understand this whole mystique abt clubbing/pubbing at ard 18-20 when the prospect of hedonistic pleasures awaits the youth who just turned the corner on an imposed curfew. Ahh... the vaguely dangerous scent of forbidden fruit. Mixing the vapors of alcohol with the hint of raw sexuality in a confined area can only but moist antispatory lips.<br><br>Still, my advice is dun get so hung up abt being cool and being seen or even to be seen to indulge in a cooler-than-thou lifestyle. Remember the etymological root of "glamour" is Middle Gallic for "illusion".<br><br>BTW, MayaJade, *smile*, somehow I doubt very much that you can mix anything decent from that list  :p. I actually ran the songs you listed through my head. The BPM is all wrong and it will take emormous amt of ingenuity and hrs of premixing to get them to string together ... and it still will sound awkward.  ATB with All Saints ...err.. I'll pass. If you are interested in an ecletic sound, you can try the Liquid Room (hopefully it has not been rendered dead as the dinosaurs by the proliferation of Top 40s in MSR).<br><br>Alt, hop onto the next flight to UK.<br><br>cheers.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>kITTY...OF COS IT'S BITTER...that's why i think that it's not an old lady's drink.  Most people cannot tahun the taste or the strength.  It's like drinking alcoholic lemon peels....Really cool, and it's very fragrant. Some of the other drinks smell like puke.<br><br>Maybe you want to go out drinking wiff me one day. :-) he he he...<br><br>I also dance...quite good also, but must get high.<br><br>And if all else fails, just buy yourself 4 jugs of beer.  That usually does it best for me, and you have more to drink than if you just order those hard liquers...ok so it tastes like shit, but hell, you trade in the taste for the mistique and machismo associated with beer drinking.<br><br>And although I have grown out of the pubbing disco phase quite a long time ago, i find myself going back more often than i have ever gone before.  As a designer, it is very difficult to maintain myslf and my design knowledger and iuntegrity when i am not in touch witht he latest trends and activities...<br><br>hahaha ...This is one of the few professions where a person can have an excuse for never growing up.  As designers, we have to stay very current with affairs and social happenings etc...If we stop we die as designers..kekekek...so you may call it glamour chasing or what, but for people like us it's a necessity as a car salesman must always keep updated with newest cars and driving trends.....hee hee...good excuse eh????<br><br>I tell you people one thing though...If the party isn't anywhere else, then you know it's got to be inside my pants....har har har har...</div>
