            <div class='col-md body'>hey folks, its your friendly Jianwen from Jurong West at your service..<br><br>today I would like to talk about the human race..nope this isnt about the movie DRIVEN<br><br>its about our race..<br><br>we all are racing, in the rat race, not real rats, but much like a rat in behaviour..selfish, timid, anxious and cruel..always seeking out something to overwhelm our lives<br><br>its true..we all know that at the end of the race its either fame or glory or descendents all the way .. sometimes it can be both.<br><br>how to get fame or glory? by being very good in your thing or being outstanding in your field earning you credits in terms of media exposure or audience applause or handshakes with people<br><br>how to have descendents? by chasing after the opposite sex..this phase of life is called settling down..it sounds easy but it needs alot of preparation..getting to know the opposite sex can be difficult for some people, maybe because they are not absolutely sure of their intentions..let you all know that the only intention of knowing the opposite sex is if she's married or single and if single what are her intentions..I see the only reason to know the opposite sex is to get married and have children, to get married without children, or to pay her for a service and go for the next one.<br><br>This sums up what i have to say..and it was a delicious bowl of beancurd with egg dessert..i am not desserting you guys<br><br>next up i am going to talk about the theory of fire and how it links with relationships among people<br><br>==THeory of fire===<br><br>Fire may be classified into two types:<br>Unwanted and Wanted<br><br>Unwanted fires are caused by accidents or by sabotage. They are like unwanted relationships among people eg. between a married woman and a stranger, or incest etc.<br><br>Wanted Fires, are useful , desirable fires<br>they are like an agreement among people to work together.<br><br>The most basic fire is a self-started. It establishes a personal relationship with the external world.eg. ceiling lights, fans<br><br>Complex manifestations of fire are found in modern devices: eg. Computers, Vehicles. People maintain these fires because they provide a means for work or transport.<br><br>DO YOU KNOW?<br>============<br>A hawker maintains his stall and deals with fire for at least 8 hours a day. He has to endure at least 15 minutes of stove fire with only brief rests. Further more, there's gas and electricity, if he isnt careful, then zap he goes<br><br>To have a proper meal at home, there is a need for a lot of preparation, and dealings with at least 2 flames and many chops<br><br>To drive a car, not only must pass licence, it puts the driver into a CLASS 3 mentality..effectively limiting the driver's sense of anger not exceeding 6 window panes<br><br>whoops...time to go<br>thanks for listening or skimming through..<br><br>do you know?<br>There are two types of calculus. One is mathematics the other is the teeth..remember to brush your teeth young people<br><br></div>
