            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm.  I was in the church last Sunday when suddenly a thought came into my mind.  How if the Bible is actually some kind of ancient science fiction.  Since it is compiled from different writers, maybe it's some sort of collaboration or an anthology.  I know it's stretching it a bit, but well, fancy this, how if I've been calling a fictional character God.<br><br>Perhaps this can be called heresy, but if God gives me an inquiring mind, surely it is not wrong to use it?  In any case, I am not doubting the existence of God, I am just wondering if the biblical god is the one.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was thinking for a while before I reply to this tread for fear of starting another "christainity"  Tread. but what the heck..<br><br>I have been pondering on this question for a long time, ever since I have develope independant thinking, in fact. But I have yet to come to any conculsions for the big guy up there have yet to show me the way. Well but I suppose I could share some thoughts.<br><br>Is the god in the bible real? Or more generally since I'm not christian, is the god you believe in real? In the case of the bible, I understand from my little knowledge and exposure to the religion that it was written by man and not god, in fact, there are none to my knowledge in any religion which have any documents that were written by their specific god. So come to think of it, did man know god from another man, who might not even have seen god before? It is to me more likeone blind man leading the way for another.<br><br>God as himself never did appear before man and proclaim himself true, and the reason many religion preach is that god is almighty and does not need to show himself to prove that he exsist. Or that his workings are all around us to see, and that itself is a proof of his presence. That I do not know yet, for I am a man who believes when he sees.<br><br>Could god be a fictional character? Possible. shakamuni did not proclaim himself to be the almighty, in fact he did say that he is too a man. But after a few milleniums his spirit was lost and now, people pray to him as though he is god. From what I know about buddism, buddist are suppose to practice buddism more as a philosophy of life rather than a religion. the techings of shakamuni emphasis on the ways of living as a true human being rather than a religion to seek something external such as heavenly help.<br><br>Original Taoism, is based on the teachings of Lao Zi, but it is very much distorted now. Taoism's gods and deities are also man in the first place,some do not even exsist but in stories told by Lao Zi when he cites examples.  In fact, a lot of the gods in the religion were actually casted in the chinese classic,"The naming of gods" which was based on a rebellion war in the shang dynasty, the first dynasty of China. Others were added along the way as time pasts.<br><br>I can't comment on Islam as my knowledge of it's history is pitiful. But I have yet heard of gods appearing as himself to any man in real life. correct me if I am wrong.<br><br>After these analysis, I find my question still unanswered, as I still believe that there is some god. questions like life beginnings, how the earth was form and all that have yet been totally answered by science, though the possibility of it being answered is still there. Who knows, science might explain god's presence one day.<br><br>Hope I did not offend anyone in my post, I seriously dun want this to become another flame thread. If there are any mistakes in my posts please feel free to correct me, for I am just another ignorant fool.<br><br>------------------<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Just my $0.02 + $0.03(from Lex) worth</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MayaJade:<br><br>I've asked myself this question before. Well, let us look into the New Testament for familiarity sake. The writers of the Gospels Matthew, Mark and John were first eyewitnesses to the events of Jesus life. Paul was converted on the way to Damascus when Jesus talked to him. And many of the letters to the early church was written by Paul being a first hand witness of God's transformation.<br><br>Ok, maybe you can assume they were were just trying to write a science fiction book out of a wonderful character like Jesus. But most, if not all, the disciples and believers including those that I have named died defending their beliefs. Paul was imprisoned for his fervour for Christ. Peter is one of the many who died for Christ. He died on an inverted crucifix. Personally, if I knew that the character Christ was something I invented myself, surely I would not die defending this fiction, right?

            <div class='col-md body'>Note: not a flaming post or whatever &amp; don't wish to quarrel with anyone over this thread.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>YES! God is real, definitely real - you just have to look at nature to see His wondrous creation. Contrary to what scientists may say about evolution, I believe that God created the universe for how can anything evolve out of NOTHING? Only God can create something out of nothing.<br><br>Believing in Jesus Christ is sometimes real tough 'coz it is based on faith &amp; a God whom we cannot visualise or see. Following Christ is even tougher 'coz His teachings go against our natural instincts for self survival. To me God is not only real, He is sarcastic, funny, almighty, but most of all loving &amp; merciful - just read the bible to hear Him speak to you. A good study bible would be more helpful than an ordinary bible 'coz of the accompanying notes to explain the customs &amp; signifiance of the times then.<br><br>My bible knowledge isn't that great but God did appear to man before: Adam, Abraham, Issac, Moses, others He spoke to: David, Solomon &amp; the prophets of course.<br><br>No doubt that the bible was written by men, but it's divinely inspired because no literature written over a course spanning almost 2000 years could have that kind of continuity if it wasn't inspired by God. Furthermore, the bible doesn't white wash the sins of God's chosen people, every great deed or great sin is recorded for all future generations to know. In addition, archaeological finds confirm certain events of bibical times.<br><br>One dead but famous person once likened faith in God resembles a wager: "If I believe in God and life after death and you do not, and if there is no God, we both lose when we die. However, if there is a God, you still lose and I gain everything.Â”<br><br>Besides, believing in God is more than that for when you truly believe, God will give you peace, a kind peace that the world cannot give you &amp; when things get really tough, somehow you'll find a will to go on.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thanks.<br><br>i do believe in god, but the bible?  if i'm not mistaken, the bible is a compilation of writings...the compilation is done by the church...so the church could choose what they want to be included and what they want out.<br><br>about the historical evidence, there are only some of them, what about the incidents that did not leave any?  there are many people who die for things which are not necessarily true, maybe they simply believe it to be true.<br><br>Is it possible to have christian-like faith by following what the bible teach because it seems to be good teachings irregardless whether it is part of a good, reflective story or something that really happened?<br><br>finally, if we're to apply the strictest sense of this:  i am the way of truth and life, no one can get to the father if not through me ---&gt;  then what happened to Budha ?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hhow do you know which one is real? I think the best way is to "taste and see".<br><br>Other then being a buddhist when I was a kid. Nothing besides Christianity has drawn me so strongly. The initial draw was that I found that in this faith, it was God who was reaching out to humans instead of us trying to reach out to them. Took that step of faith, and began to learn more of it.<br><br>So as I learn more of it, I guess it has been working actively in my life. My character changed; used to have bad temper but not anymore.<br><br>Anyway back to the authencity of the Bible. True it's a compilation of books. I remember discussing about it in another thread before. Just to repeat what I said. The books of the bible were written by many different authors, eg Moses, Paul, Mark, Mathhew, Luke, John, David, etc. These authors too have different educational backgrounds. Some were shepherds, kings, scholars, doctors, fishermen, etc. Yet they are centred on Christ Himself, flawlessly. Though some might argue about the flawlessness, picking on contradictions in the Bible but one cannot ignore how wonderfully it is woven on a main theme. The books in the bible also were written over a period of time. Yet the essence of it is still continuous.<br><br>mmm...the copies of Aristotle's work were only found 1400 years after he wrote the original. similarly, Plato's works were only found 1100 after his orignals were written. Comparing to the Synoptic Gospels which were found only two to three hundred years within their writing. Yet, Aristotle's works and Plato's were often quoted and discussed. And their authencity were seldom questioned.<br><br>Anyway, ultimately you have to experience Christianity and allow God to move you. That's the best way to know if He is real. He is always ready to work in your life, you just have to allow Him to.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I'm glad the way this thread discussion has been going, calm and collected. Let's keep it this way  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
