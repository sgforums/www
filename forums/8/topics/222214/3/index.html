            <div class='col-md body'>No, not all dads behave like that, but it *is* more common in Asian parents coz traditionally we keep our emotions pent up.  I get a feeling he's angry about something else, maybe related to you maybe not, but he can't solve the problem and is taking it out on you.  I was raised in a more....er...western way.. so from my POV he's being irresponsible.  Lashing out at you doesn't solve anything and you appear confused... plus you're so young.  Somehow he's gotta learn that it's doing you more harm than good (it is, isn't it?) and change.<br><br>I dunno if it's a solution u're after, but it helps to be in control of your emotions/situations.. learn to recognize the signs right before a caning, and make sure you're not conveniently "lazing" around when your parent needs to vent anger.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>agreed that youths nowdays... some really need more then just caning.<br><br>to TS, just bear with it lor... Have to show him that you are a grown up, not a kid anymore. Sooner or later, he will stop it realising that you have grown. However, if you are like being disrespectful, dun say you are 16, even if you are 30+ i would also make sure I cane you like some fag.<br><br>Lol. My dad once caned me when I was blocking his view while he was watching tv. and my mum caned me using those spilt bamboo poles simply because my writing wasnt nice enough for her. Well, tat was all in the past. I hate it then, still hate it but I wont be who I am if not for those screwed up whackings. So I am still thankful for my parents and everything.<br><br>Now they know who I am, a grown up kiddo who knows what he wants and they respect it and I respect them too.<br><br>Bear with it kid, you are still young. =)</div>
