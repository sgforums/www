            <div class='col-md body'>there is this topic about smoking. many are pointing that the cause of global warming is vehicles and not smoking.<br><br>i understand that and i was just wondering if live earth has successfully conveyed its agenda to the population.<br><br>do you think it has or not, in sg?<br><br>my opinion is that, unless the govt begins to place a high priority on it, the situation will not get better.<br><br>reason is the richs will not be bothered about such things. because they can afford to live in air conditioned homes. so the heat will probably not affect them.<br><br>and in other developing countries, the vehicles should be old and not fuel efficient. but what can they do? they can't afford better stuff unless they improve which requires them to take this path first.<br><br>is it too shallow? pardon if i am. just want to hear opinions.<br><br>cheers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The vehicle part will actually just "fix itself" in a few years i guess since the industry itself is self-regulating.. except maybe for china so for the purpose of this discussion i'm not going to involve china regulations or china cars.<br><br>regardless, manufacturers like toyota and bmw and mercedes etc. have been putting in a lot of effort into researching and developing "green vehicles" for reasons like global warming and that oil is not unlimited.. they also do this because of laws in places like california.. nissan for example had to re-make their diesel engines to meet diesel emissions criteria for california and new nissan cars sold in america and japan will have the new engine that is cleaner than their previous diesel engine..<br><br>the singapore government has also taken steps like green car rebates, diesel emission laws (thats why now all the taxis new new one all sort of brands one cos the old taxis dont meet the new laws) etc<br><br></div>

National Geographic or Discovery Channel got say already. </div></blockquote>yea.. national geo and discovery channel did say it's fiction.. because of the time frame.. as in everything happen too fast in the movie.. ice age will not happen in a matter a few weeks.. it happen over a period of time.. the fiction part is only the time frame.. the ice age is not fiction and it's part or the earth climate cycle.. if we don't do anything about global warming, there will be either one of the 2 ending for earth..<br><br>1)global flooding and intense storms.. stronger heat waves, more disease and whatever you are hearing about the consequensces of global warming..<br>--&gt;results in human deaths..<br>2)tigger ice age--&gt;results in widespread death of humans race<br><br>i guess all of us in the world should play a part in solving thing problem as this is our only home.. without earth, do you think anyon of us will be talking down here in sgforums or shop in orchard road? even in such a small country like singapore, it's important for us to play a part as we as well contribute to global warming. i personally thinks that live earth does some effect to the masses. it changed the thinking of people about global warming and the importance of it.. people now knows that there is global warming and this is a good start.. but unfortunately, we might be too late to fully solve the problem..</div>
