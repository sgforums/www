            <div class='col-md body'>IMHO, in a relationship, age doesnt matter, maturity does. as everyone knows, maturity is relative, and not proportionate to one's age... however, age does play an rather important role in BGRs when you're in your teenaged years. why? my theory, *ahem,ahem*  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> is that, throughout this period of time (13 - 20++?), you're going through a lot of changes in a very short time. each year, you go through a different experience which is totally unique. this period of time, is one of great change, where we "find ourselves"... if the age gap is TOO big (depends on the individual) you might end up with a disparity between the focal points of your conversations. a 16 year old girl might be thinking about her school, ECA, shopping, friends... a 20 year old guy in NS.. i think a gap would exist.<br><br>but this (naturally) doesn't apply to everyone. so if you guys really click, then go for it! who cares what the 'right' age is? unless of course, she's in psch. guys... (and girls! i've known of girls dating psch guys..) if she's THAT young, hands off!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Age difference?<br>Preferably -3 yrs from my point of view as a guy.<br><br>People always get the general idea that girls mature faster than guys.<br>Dunno if it's true, but the idea most girls have is that they have the mentality of +3 to 5 yrs to guys their same age.<br>True or not? I dunno. But pretty groundless I think. Well, not all guys r the same.<br><br>Whether the gal bein older than the guy pose a problem or not depends on the individuals involved. Some can be comefortable wif it, some are not.<br>One situation which can be cited as an example which does may be:<br>Guys liable to serve NS when they hit 18+<br>and girls proceed on to studies in Uni or out working.<br>When this is so, the girls get the edge when it comes to comin out to work in the society.<br>That is, when the girls start working, the guys r juz fresh out from NS or juz steppin into Uni.<br>There seems to be somewhat a status difference here. In this case, if the gal is older than the guy, wouldn't the situation be further aggravated?<br><br>Still the final note is personal preferences.<br>There're many diff kinds of people ard in this world <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Jaa ne~~~<br><br>------------------<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>To see a world in a grain of sand<br>And a heaven in a wild flower,<br>Hold infinity in the palm of your hand<br>And eternity in an hour.<br>-William Blake<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do agree that its the compatibility of the maturity that matters. Of course, thats when you are talking about long term relationships. Two people must have something to relate to.<br><br>But, I also think in today's appearence oriented world, age does not matter if you look good for your age as well. That means, if you look good at 35 someone 15 years younger than you wouldn't mind going out with you. That applies for both sexes both ways.</div>
