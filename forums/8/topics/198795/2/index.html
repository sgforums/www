As we know our military hardware are often seen deployed in times of disasters. We are always there to help our neighbours in samitarian acts for the sake of humanity, survival and peace. But we have never suggested or intervene in another nation's politics and how they should run their country.<br><br>There's one thing though that the Sg military can do.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, you say why spend so much when no war is going to happen? It is because that we spend so much that's why no war is happening to SG. It's a form of deterrence. And indirectly, buffing up our defence is also why you are able to rant about these kind of issues at your home on your computer without fearing any missles landing on your doorstep or whatsoever. It will only be a waste of money if a war happens now and for all the money spent on our defence, we would still get owned. That will be a waste of money indeed.</div>

The british troops clearly outnumbered the japanese in SG. They lost because their equipments and tactics were for wayang... Theybrought anti-tank guns into the jungles but they could not fire... and the soldiers who thought they would be fighting in deserts suddenly found themselves in the malayan jungle.

It is because that we spend so much that's why no war is happening to SG. It's a form of deterrence. And indirectly, buffing up our defence is also why you are able to rant about these kind of issues at your home on your computer without fearing any missles landing on your doorstep or whatsoever. It will only be a waste of money if a war happens now and for all the money spent on our defence, we would still get owned. That will be a waste of money indeed.</div></blockquote>we are going to die anyway so why should we eat? why continue reproducing offsprings when we know they will die one day? we are not talking about war...who wants it when the majority are not suffering from any agression? we build and maintain a defence force to deter threats that are real and may be a hurt to our economy if they surface. Terror threats and piracy are just a couple of names i can give here. why maintain your car and clean them everyday? they will wear and die off one day. why periodically change your car's breaking components...wait till it wears and cannot perform the frictional grip on the flywheel to effectively stop the vehicle then say lor</div>
