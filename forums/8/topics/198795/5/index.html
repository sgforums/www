Your ignorance have disclosed much about yourself and your world... I believe i was a misunderstanding on your part when I said that the troops who were fighting here were bound for the deserts of Libya instead. Figures do not count for much... Can you tell me how many deaths were there in the war? No one can, because there are much to account for. Likewise, I would be naive to tell you the figures which we were outnumbered. You base your argument on the above link, I can accept that, since there are many versions of history, and some truths indeed are still hidden. The topic of History is research, not what you perceive as information being uploaded into the human mind. If you think that I'm the average bunch of secondary school students then you are indeed mistaken.<br><br>If you want direct links or personal contacts to historians, kindly PM me and I'd be happy to refer. In the meanwhile, please read up more and refer more links if possible. You open my world, I thank you for this friendly discussion.<br><br>P.S I can't juggle facts with myths cause my profession binds me from doing that. I hope to engage you in a straight talk to get both our thinking right, which I hope that you will accept gracefully in a gentlemanly manner. Cheers.</div>
