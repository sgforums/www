            <div class='col-md body'>anyone here runs your own businesses? try removing your door and front gates to your shops and see what happen. its convenient for anyone to walk in and steal your goods. try locking your gates and doors...at least it will take some effort for the thief to break in take whatever which are yours.<br><br>no need army lah...so u no need a gate and lock on your shops also...u not need any agreement with your employers when u work also since no theif will steal from u and your employers will pay u every month 1 lah.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i agree with everyone that we need to spend on defence.<br><br>but how much is enough?  are we overspending?<br><br>frankly i have a feeling that the kind of weapons we buy are mostly to elevate our status.  nothing to do with the real defence.<br></div>
