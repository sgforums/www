As a basic foot soldier, it would be hard to equip everyone with all the latest gear. Our defence expenditure is high by regional standards but still small as compared to many countries. Priority has to be given to the procurement of advanced equipment such as Apache attack helicopters, long range artillery, French designed stealth warships and new missiles ranging from anti-tank to anti-ship, amongst a host of other major equipment, both classified and unclassified. There would not be much money left for improving basic equipment after these purchases. However we certainly do not want our common soldiers to be staring down the barrels of our adversaries' tanks and warplanes with only assault rifles do we? Steps however have been taken recently which are encouraging such as new boots, helmets and personal kit which will be issued within the next few years.</div>

Be it rape, for use as hostages or as human shields, robbery or just plain sadistic murder, u can be sure it will happen. The UN will deal will such problems too late as always.
