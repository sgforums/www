            <div class='col-md body'>Ponder this:<br>Prestige: In the Regional Defence Pact, whether ASEAN or Five Nations Defence Pact, Singapore is an equal partner. Contributing Air Force, Navy and Army, on the same level as Australia, UK, Malaysia. If we have only a PDF, with 303 rifles, the SAF would serve as runners for these nations, maybe climbing rambutans trees for Malaysians officers, and cooking for British soldiers, and cleaning the bunk of the Aussies.<br><br>Deterrent:An up-to-date Armed Forces also show that we are serious about defence, so that any future Saddam Hussein wannabe, who "only wants to take back what belongs to them" would think very carefully.<br><br>Keeping what we have: You don't own what you can't defend. Thats the rule in the old days, and it still is now. Tibet has no standing army. India respected her sovereignty, China didn't and grabbed Tibet first. Tibet didn't stand a chance against the Red Army. We have a neighbour who, believe me is waiting.<br><br>Workforce: Imagine all those regulars thrown into the employment market. The defence department employs a hell of a lot of our citizens.<br><br>Therefore, it is better to have a full Armed Forces than to have a half-past-six army. Money must be well spent. A lack lustre army is definitely a waste of money.<br><br>War is not the reason to raise an army.<br>Keeping the peace is.</div>
