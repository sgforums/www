IT doesn't cost $20 to make a CD. We are aware of ur profit margins if ur cds are a hit.  Please lower prices of music too.

            <div class='col-md body'>the internet started as a military communication tool back in the 1960s. Then slowly it was used forsharing of information  inside university campuses before it  became a archive access for the public. When it got sidelined to communications like IRC, email in the late 80s , that was then when they figured out that the internet could have commercial and informative uses. It went mainstream. As more sideline uses were found, it attained massive growth in the 90s<br><br>The invention of sidelined technologies fueled the body of its growth to what we call as the internet today.</div>
