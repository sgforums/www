              <p>trademark,</p>
              <p>well...if im gone wrong....u are much worse.....i hope u can kiss more ass than u can talk n think in life.because thats your job now and in the future.im only glad im not you.i would have died just being like u for a day.i can waste more time and do useless experiments gone wrong and still stay ahead of u anyday and anytime.....i can say u are even worse than an african refugee with prmary 6 education.because with not much education they can still go somewhere...drive a  saloon car thats $10k and live comfortably....and driving a car .i bet u got more schooling by going to primary 7 and sec 5.but thats pretty normal fer ya!!!ya gots lotsa schooling and is able ta judge people.</p>
              <p>i can do experiments....i can fail or pass in them...........at least im making progress.what have u done so far besides pretending to be well-schooled AND LOOKING at other people and pretending to be a "stupidvisor".yer attitude is even worse than a chickenball seller from the phillippines!!HAHAHA TO U TRADMARK!you are about to embark onto a journey to a cashless n futureless existence!!!that is my judgement as u have judged me.</p>
              <p>u need more judgement like what u judge unto me??tell me so.... that way i can just systematically break you part by part as my thesis and experiment.when im thru on u, i can just proudly put u ina box like the rest of my experiments.</p>
              <p>IT HAS COME TO MY CONCLUSION THAT THOSE WHO ARENT "COOL HEADED' ENTER AUSTRALIAN UNIVERSITIES.IM NOT SURPRISEd MURDERERS GET CHURNED OUT FROM OZ UNIVERSITIES TOO....AND along with GUN WELDING SALESMEN TOO.</p>

              <p>ya but no harm applying. depend one lar. u know uni wants money. how much can they earn if they offer place to local students rather than international full paying fees student. from financial point of view, which they preferred? of cos full fee paying international students.</p>

              <p>your parents are supportive.. yeah great... but have you really thought about it??</p>
              <p>You are 21 now, you said you still need to take what foundation course and then you start the actual uni thingy at 23? then how long is the uni course?</p>
              <p>Do you want to deplete your parents savings?? (i am not sure how rich your parents are) But if they have millions then I would say its alright to go for uni at Aust. But if your parents hard earned money is going to be used up just by your studies then i say you stay in singapore work harder and get throught UOL. Dont give excuses that its hard and you want an easier way out by escaping to AUST. What makes you think you would succeed in Aust as well? What if you fail in Aust as well? Then that doubles the pain as the time and money you spent are all wasted. Just stay in Singapore, work harder and get through UOL.</p>
              <p>Do you know how much it is to spend studying in Australia? The school fees alone is already high, then renting of apartments is like 500-700 per week which is around 2-3k per month. If you going to stay there for like 4 years its already over 100k. Lets include the school fees, your allowances and transport and things like these... its way over 200K....</p>
              <p>So you better think twice, especially if you are using Aust route as an escapement from your current situation at UOL, then I would say buck up and study hard. If only you had study harder to get into a more recognise local uni.</p>

              your feedback is really valuable to me MaNyZer. The undergrad course is another 3 years. I won't say my parents are super rich but they've got no problems with it.
              
              I guess I would just buck up and think thrice for now..

              <p>u dont need to rent the apartments in the city. Look for the suburban areas. The accomodation in Monash Uni campus costs around $170 a week currently. if u choose private homestay, its like $100-130 per week Just get a car and yr options are more..usually the ulu places rent cost cheaper</p>

              <p>even after spending that kinda time and $$$ on education....do u think u would even get a job in spore with your distance learning degree??in the past it would be ok but there are a million foreigners in singapore...all with degrees from university of bangladesh to swatow mandarin orange university.yes...about a million or more and more coming in next year due to better economic prospects in spore!how much do u think your pay would be with a degree to mr loo from yangtze university who is willing to werk for $1500/month or free even for 3 months for company.big mnc would pay at least $2k/mth for 5 years experience if they keep hiring those from china,india,bangla,phiillippine etc etc university.</p>
              <p>what about your 1 million fellow sporeans all from NUS,NTU etc with degrees too.what about those sporeans who went to europe,usa and canada for their degree?and what bout those older degree holders that are switching jobs?</p>
              <p>and what about those other peoplle from malaysia...they also have good degrees from england and very good universities worldwide.then what about those wealthy chinese people from brunei and indonesia who studied RMIT and USA???</p>
              <p>you have competitors WITH DEGREES from:</p>
              <p>CHEAPER COUNTRIES-------CHINA ,INDIA,BURMA,PHIILLIPPINES,BANGLADESH(MOST SPEAK GOOD ENGLISH WITH SOME ACCENT...SOME WITH AMERICAN ACCENT...BUT THEY ARE STILL ACCEPTABL) 1.5MILIION DEGREE HOLDER PERHAPS</p>
              <p>MODERATE COUNTRIES-------SINGAPORE,MALAYSIA,INDONESIA,BRUNEI(1MILLION ??)</p>
              <p>DEVELOPED COUNTRIES-------USA AND OTHER DEVELOPED COUNTRIES(1000?)</p>
              <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>WHAT CHANCE DO U HAVE?CAN IT SEE TO IT YER EDUCATION WOULD BE WORTHWHILE AFTER ALL THE CASH SPENT ON IT?HOW IS YER RESUME GOIING TO BE RETRIEVED AT EACH MNC HUMAN RESOURCE OFFICE WHEN ITS FLOODED BY MILLIONS OF RESUME BY FOREIGN N DOMESTIC JOB APPLICANTS.YOU CAN ACTUALLY SWIM AMONGST THE RESUME IF THEEY ARE ALL FLUFFED UP AND THROWN INTO AN EMPTY SWIMMING POOL.</p>
              <p>HOW MANY GOLD BARS ARE U GOIN TO BUY AFTER ALL THAT EDUCATION AND KNOWING FULL WELL THERE WONT BE MUCH OF A COMPANY INCREMENT EVEN IF THE BOSS TOOK OFF HIS PANTS AND SHOWED U HE IS SINCERE TO U AND STUFF.</p>

              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>I’m 21 this year and currently a year 1 Undergrad from
              University of London in sg.</p>
              <p>Well, I’m thinking of withdrawing from the program to study in
              <span>UNSW</span> or UQ in oz. I want to do that because I
              do not really like <span>UOL</span> as even though its a
              private degree, the standards is really high and its really hard to
              obtain 1st/2nd upper class honours (if u really know the standards
              of <span>UOL</span>). I would rather use the energy to get
              a world class degree from a top uni in aus.</p>
              <p>But the only setback is that I’ve got to undertake the
              foundation (duration 1yr) which is starting nxt year as I’ve not
              quite met the requirements to gain direct entry for their undergrad
              program cos their requirements are high.</p>
              <p>That means I will start my degree at the age of 23, which I feel
              is kinda old instead of graduating at the age of 24 if I continue
              my degree in <span>UOL</span>.. Financially, my parents
              are supportive and they have no problems with it.</p>
              <p>Should I choose this route? Is it really worth it?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>A concept that you must get clear is that a degree is nothing much but a door to get you to your first job. Most PRIVATE employer does not bother too much about how well you did in Uni, be it first/second/third, as long as they find you worthy to be part of their team they will hire you. And it is job performance that counts. It is a fact that most smart nerds are very good at studying but they cannot do work. After you get your first job, your working experiences are what that counts. Nobody look at your degree later on. </p>
              <p>In public sector, you must check if they accredited your OS degree. First, 2nd ... counts in terms of salary and not in terms of work.</p>
              <p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">However, if you are doing post -grad or phd that is another story. 1st, 2nd (upper) allows you to get a scholarship for post-grad... Yes it is better to switch university then.  whatever rotten uni you go, as long as you have your 1st and 2nd uppper on the cert, you meet one of the requirement. NEXT is the GMAT or GRE which you need to take,is an independent exam.</span></p>

              <p>to get into harvard you need a almost perfect SAT score. Besides that, you must participate in a ton of activities that is able to show that you have leadership abilities. </p>
              <p>Besides, if he already thinks that the private degree is hard, Harvard is worse. Maybe Dartmouth.</p>

              since i've got my eyes set on australian unis i will settle for it.. furthermore unsw/uq is a good school.
              
              yes a degree is just a paper to get my first job. for UOL its a private degree and its 100% not recognized by the government. 
              
              for me, UNSW is for sure better than UOL. The opportunity cost for me is that i'll graduate at 26 instead of 24..

              <p>may be this is more correct.</p>
              <p>It is not the Uni that you go to, it is the discipline that you study. China's IT, mechanical, eee, medical and many areas has exceeded the western country. hence the MNC who need the relevant expertise will have to get them from china. </p>
              <p>Physics, Law, Chemistry, Economy ... get from the western country.</p>
