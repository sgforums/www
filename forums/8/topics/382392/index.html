              Hi all,
                      
              I'm 21 this year and currently a year 1 Undergrad from University of London in sg.
                      
              Well, I'm thinking of withdrawing from the program to study in UNSW or UQ in oz. I want to do that because I do not really like UOL as even though its a private degree, the standards is really high and its really hard to obtain 1st/2nd upper class honours (if u really know the standards of UOL). I would rather use the energy to get a world class degree from a top uni in aus. 
                      
              But the only setback is that I've got to undertake the foundation (duration 1yr) which is starting nxt year as I've not quite met the requirements to gain direct entry for their undergrad program cos their requirements are high. 
                      
              That means I will start my degree at the age of 23, which I feel is kinda old instead of graduating at the age of 24 if I continue my degree in UOL.. Financially, my parents are supportive and they have no problems with it. 
                      
              Should I choose this route? Is it really worth it?

In australia, though u will enjoy studying, i t can be even more stressful as u are alone, need to cook for yrself to eat, ect.  Besides, discipline problem in australian university hostels is also a prob. Why not transfer to other courses within SIM?</p>

              Hitman: MIT is super hard to get in and even if u got the $, it won't buy you a ticket in because you are not the "material". Only the cream of the crop gets into unis like this.. I met one of a SAFOS scholar during my NSF days doing his degree at MIT.
              
              MasterMoogle: I do not find it super tough, its standards are high but still doable. For my type, I prefer a slower and more relaxing pace. Aus top unis are on par with our local unis and furthermore, government sectors recognise it as they don't accept private degrees. well i shall see..
              
              BenBenDeZhu: I agree with u. Its doable and I've learnt alot from UOL also. Normally lessons (e.g) POA other unis take a few months to teach, UOL can just do it in a few lessons. BTW what did u major on and are u working now? Did u clear econs on ur first attempt?
              
              
              â˜ƒÂ®: I've got a few friends in aus already. I don't think I will stay in a hostel and i don't think I wanna change to other courses in SIM..

              <p>i can advise u , if u want to go to aus uni, make sure they grant some exemptions for yr UOL at SIM, which i think they will. But i really advise u to try to finish yr UOL, and then go to aus for a 1 year MBA</p>
              <p>and pls dont rely on trusting on yr aus frens, in aus everyone is busy with their own problems and u are all out on yr own. Singaporeans generally are not very helpful in aus either. Very imp  = Driving license and $2000 average to buy car in AUS.</p>
