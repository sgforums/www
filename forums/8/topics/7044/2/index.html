Things like eating with the opposite (and maybe delibrately keeping it from your girl) does not equate to infidelity. that would be too extreme. but it does mean that the guy is not completely honest with the girl rite? infidelity would be too strong a word. perhaps honesty is a better word in such cases. relationship is built on trust, and to build up the trust, it's to be honest to each other, even with little things like that. wat do u think?<br><br>(sorry if i'm digressing from the actual topic  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">)<br><br>[This message has been edited by sparkle (edited 23 April 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, my turn (finally !! Saving the best for last hehe)<br><br>I have not carefully read all the posts in this thread so if i do repeat some points you guys have already brought up, please bear with me.<br><br>This topic is difficult to present in a clear way ... let me try ....<br><br><strong>Sexual Infidelity</strong><br><br>This is about having a sexual relationship with someone other than your loved one (stead or spouse).<br><br>Humans have sexual needs. Some people can control their sexual needs well but some can't.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">those who can control their needs</span><br><br>people who have the strength of character will not engage in sexual infidelity even when seduced. They can resist temptations even if their spouse are not able to satisfy them. Their sense of responsibilty is stronger than their sexual desires.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">those who cannot control themselves</span><br><br>These people do not have a strong strength of character. They will either look for sex voluntarily (look for prostitutes or go for one night stands) or give in to seduction and temptations (motivated).<br><br>Hence there is a need to understand the cause of his infidelity. Is it a "voluntary" act or a "motivated" one ? I will say that the former cause more hurt than the latter.<br><br><strong>Emotional Infidelity</strong><br><br>colette has mentioned the Net as a possible medium of emotional infidelity. And there was once a case in Singapore where a husband had sued his wife for having extra-marrital affairs with a person on the Net. The Net is truly a dangerous place ! Perhaps there may be "virtual mistresses" in the future ! And the wife will not go to the mistress' house with brooms but she will send trojans and viruses to the mistress, hehehe  :p<br><br>Emotional infidelity is much more complex then Sexual Infidelity because one cannot be "seduced" or "tempted" to betray his loved one emotionally.<br><br>As a result, emotional infidelity is more of a "volunteered" one. While sexual infidelity can be more of a "motivated" one (unless the person goes around asking for sex or look for prostitutes, then it is definitely a "volunteered" one)<br><br>Hence, it is more difficult for a someone to engage in emotional infidelity than sexual infidelity.<br><br>Moreover, an emotional relationship is more difficult to start and maintain than a pure sexual one as the latter has more direct and "tangible" benefits.<br><br>In addition, a pure sexual relationship is easy to break up since it is a "physical" relationship. As long as the 2 parties are not going out together anymore, they cannot commit to sexual acts. However, an emotional relationship is more difficult to resolve. How many times have you heard of a person still missing his ex even after years ? Physical separation does not ensure the end of the relationship and worse still, one can never be sure when the relationship will end, not even the offender himself.<br><br>When it comes to the "trust" issue, emotional infidelity will definitely result in a greater loss of "trust" than a sexual one.<br><br>let me give you 2 examples :<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">example 1:</span><br>When your loved one is by your side physically, you know he can't commit sexual infidelity (cos he is beside you) however, you can't be sure if he is thinking of someone else.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">example 2:</span><br>When your loved one is making love to you, you also can't be sure if he is actually thinking about another person. Perhaps he is imagining you as another person.<br><br>This 2 examples illustrates why emotional infidelity will result in a greater loss of trust.<br><br><strong>conclusion</strong><br><br>I will think that emotional infidelity will incur more hurt because infidelity is all about the <strong>betrayal of "trust"</strong>. Since emotional infidelity will lead to a greater loss of "trust", it will incur more pain and do more harm to the relationship.<br><br>I hope I have made my post clear to all    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by LittleMan (edited 23 April 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi ray,<br><br>of course i do not think that guys are immune to emotions, but it is common knowledge that guys can do the physical act without having emotions for the gals. okay, i may be generalizing here, but that is what i hear. usually, for a guy to feel for a girl, his heart would be split and when it comes to affairs of the heart, a split heart is no good, sooner or later, either one of the gals would want the guy to make a choice. and when a part of your heart has been given away, it is very difficult to have it back, even if the years blunt the feelings of love and i think there will always be a soft spot for the other party. if the guy had loved the gal before me, i mean there is nothing i can say for i have loved others too, but in a current relationship, if a new someone were to come into the picture, it is a harder pill to swallow.<br><br>emotional betrayal in another sense could be that the guy would tell the other gal stuff he wouldnÂ’t tell his own girlfriend or wife, regardless of whether he has feelings love or not for the new party. imagine your girlfriend sharing her innermost secrets with another man but not you and yet she says that she doesnÂ’t love him at all, just that he seems to understand her more, wouldnÂ’t you find it hard to believe and at the same time be hurt? anyway, i believe that no one is able to satisfy the all the needs of one person, so it is entirely possible for either party to confide things which they may never ever tell their love ones to others and i guess that hurts because when one is in love, one would like to think that one can be everything to the other.<br><br>i guess guys and gals would view physical and emotional betrayals differently. for gals, usually, we know that sometimes, guys are easily seduced by a pretty face or fabulous figure, whether the guy eventually feel anything for the gal is anyoneÂ’s guess. once sexual transgressions have occurred (be it kissing, petting or sex), it is hard for either to forgive. personally i donÂ’t think i can, in our parentsÂ’ generation, where women depend on the men to bring home the bacon, they had no choice but to suffer in silence, these days, it is different, sometimes, the gal may even earn more than the guy and for her to accept sexual infidelity is really hard and who knows how many men that gal has slept with? you know what they say about sleeping with someone, you not only sleep with him or her, you are also sleeping with their exs.<br><br>whereas for a gal to have sex with a guy, i think 90% of gals would either have liked the guy a lot or may even think that they are in love with the guy, so the physical betrayal for guys would be greater as it would involved both normally.<br><br>maybe i am old fashioned, i think that when a couple is dating exclusively, they have no business going round kissing others, having cozy lunches/dinners/breakfasts, etc. humans are emotional beings, prolonged contact with others usually inspire either of these:<br><br>1. you like them and would like to bring the friendship further into a relationship<br>2. you like them but would like to remain as good friends only<br>3. you donÂ’t like them and canÂ’t wait for them to get out of your life.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>this topic is a very subjective one, there is no right or wrong, but it was good to read of othersÂ’ responses. thank you to all who posted here.<br><br>colette babette<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Juz a simple question: a person can love more than one person at the same time, so is that emotional infidelity? What if the love is true towards both persons?<br><br>Fidelity is a rather restrictive concept that deems a person to be morally upright if he or she sticks to one person. But in the light of the above question, does fidelity still matter?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi LittleMan,<br><br>It must have been this post of yours that closed down this thread  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">. You have covered almost every aspect of both types of infidelity that there is not much more left to write.<br><br>But to keep it alive, write I must.<br><br><blockquote><br>those who can control their needs<br>people who have the strength of character will not engage in sexual infidelity even when seduced. They can resist temptations even if their spouse are not able to satisfy them. Their sense of responsibility is stronger than their sexual desires.<br></blockquote>I think this would depend on who is doing the seducing, if it is just any gal or guy, it would be easy to reject, but if it happens to be someone they even have the slightest hint of liking or love for, it would not be that easy. Of course, they are still people of high morality around (but they are also becoming like the dodo, if not, there wonÂ’t be so many cases of adulteries or casual affairs around), and to resist that kind of temptation is no easy matter.<br><br>When my guy commits sexual infidelity, it matters not one iota if it is voluntary or motivated, he disappoints me and depending on the level of love I have for him, I would either learn to forgive and hopefully forget or I would show him the door. However, I honestly believe that if it happens once, it is likely to happen again. And since the trust between us is broken, it is very hard to patch it back. And knowing myself, I would probably show him the door even if it kills me.<br><br>Oh, you have brought in a new category of infidelity, the virtual kind. Duh. This is just as hard to swallow as the other two, I find it hard to believe that if two people have been acting lover like in cyberspace would not want it to become real in reality if they donÂ’t scare each other off with their physical appearance. I may have nightmares over this one, thank you LittleMan.<br><br><blockquote><br>Emotional infidelity is much more complex then Sexual Infidelity because one cannot be "seduced" or "tempted" to betray his loved one emotionally.<br></blockquote>I have to disagree with you here, the written and spoken word are powerful mediums, it can anger, seduce, beguile, make one feels happy, even high, etc, etc.<br><br>If one knows which buttons to push, it is quite easy to make the other party fall in love with them, especially if they have met before or in the case of the Net, seen each otherÂ’s photos and physically they are not turned off by each other.<br><br>No one volunteers emotional infidelity, the other party usually would have encouraged one party, no matter how slightly. Unless you happen to be one of those hopeless romantics, who loves to love from afar.<br><br><blockquote><br>Moreover, an emotional relationship is more difficult to start and maintain than a pure sexual one as the latter has more direct and "tangible" benefits.<br></blockquote>An emotional relationship is not that difficult to start or maintain, you can think of the other party all the while when you are awake, and if your desires are strong, you may even dream of them whereas you canÂ’t have a sexual one all your waking hours even if the benefits are tangible. I think an emotional relationship is also tangible because it induces a sense of well being, and sometimes, thinking of love ones, the day just seems brighter, it may even bring a goofy smile to your face.<br><br><blockquote><br>In addition, a pure sexual relationship is easy to break up since it is a "physical" relationship. As long as the 2 parties are not going out together anymore, they cannot commit to sexual acts.<br></blockquote>True, but they can still fantasize, canÂ’t they? Your two examples support the fantasizing part of my view. And I will definitely have nightmares from now. Thank you LittleMan.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Hope to hear your views and I see you are still at it with the Â“AÂ” level and Poly education thread.<br>colette<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>BluErf,<br><br>A person can like many people at the same time but best to love only one, if you love two guys (for gals) or two gals (for guys), your loyalty is split and it will take a toll on the relationship. Choose one who would make you happiest and vice versa. Humans are selfish beings, when it comes to steady boyfriend/girlfriend or husband/wife, no sharing, at least for me.<br><br>Actually once you are committed to a relationship, it is best not to entertain thoughts that there might be someone else out there who could be better suited to you, for there will always be someone better than your partner.

Humans are not stones, we fall for temptations. That's why there is this saying (by Mao Ze Dong):<br><br>jiang(1) shan(1) ru(2) ci(3) duo(1) jiao(1)<br>chang(2) shi(3) ying(1) xiong(2) jin(4) zhe(2) yao(1)<br><br>and<br><br>Ying(1) xiong(2) nan(2) guo(4) mei(3) ren(2) guan(1)<br><br>However, I do think that if a person is being seduced, he has to be responsible for "allowing the other party to seduce him". If the person cannot control himself at the <span style="font-style: italic;">first attempt</span> of seduction, then i would say he belongs to the "cannot control themselves" category.<br><br>On the other hand, if he is being seduced consistently, he can by all means avoid it by telling the other party off or avoid interaction with that person altogether. If at the end of the day, he is still being seduced, he would have to be responsible for being a "willing party".<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>I honestly believe that if it happens once, it is likely to happen again.<br></strong></blockquote>yes, this i totally agree. That's why i cannot accept a girl who engages in one night stands to be my gf/wife. Cos one fine day when i grow old or when she is sick of my "sexual performance", she may indulge in one night stands again. The trust just isn't there.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>a new category of infidelity, the virtual kind.<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>i have an experience with this before. In the irc chat room #singapore20+, there used to be this 24 year old ger (married) who like to talk dirty with other guys in the early morning .... when her hubby is still in bed. I really wonder how her hubby will feel if he saw what she wrote.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>I have to disagree with you here, the written and spoken word are powerful mediums, it can anger, seduce, beguile, make one feels happy, even high, etc, etc.<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>oh yes, this is especially true to females. But it does not work much on males unless the conversation is about soccer or politics  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Or unless that guy is extremely down and needs someone to confide.<br><br>Like i wrote in the other post,<br><br>"Man falls in love through the eyes, woman falls in love through the ears"<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>No one volunteers emotional infidelity, the other party usually would have encouraged one party, no matter how slightly.<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>well, no one will go around confiding his darkest secrets to everybody right ? So to a certain extend, he "volunteered" to advance in the relationship. In the case of the Net, if you do play irc, you'll discover that there are many people out there looking for someone to confide. They find it easier to talk over the Net. Many (who are attached) had confided in me over irc before, where i will comfort them and analyse their problems with them. Some like it and asked me for my icq number, email, telephone number or even address ! But i never give  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> (unless he is a guy, but not gay). Well, in the irc case, it is a pure "volunteered" one.<br><br><blockquote><br>An emotional relationship is not that difficult to start or maintain, you can think of the other party <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>all the while </strong></span>when you are awake, and if your desires are strong, you may even dream of them <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">whereas you canÂ’t have a sexual one all your waking hours</span></strong> even if the benefits are tangible.<br></blockquote>i say "emotional relationship" is more difficult to maintain becos of the time and effort you have to put in. In your quote above, you have already proven my point (see the <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>bold italic</strong></span> words)<br><br>Whereas in a sexual relationship, as long as you need "it", look for that "provider" and the whole thing will only last at most one hour per "session". (time required depends on individual, my point is, the time taken is "short" unless you are talking about Annabel Chong)<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>True, but they can still fantasize, canÂ’t they? Your two examples support the fantasizing part of my view.<br></strong></blockquote>yes, but it will no longer be a <span style="font-style: italic;">pure</span> "sexual infidelity".<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>And I will definitely have nightmares from now.<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>haha, i used to give you headache in the "Origin of Life" thread and now i give you nightmares !<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>I see you are still at it with the Â“AÂ” level and Poly education thread.<br></strong></blockquote>yeah, i am trying to close it.</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi LittleMan,<br><br><blockquote><br>haha, so its my fault ? Sorry about that !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></blockquote>somehow you donÂ’t seem truly sorry.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><blockquote><br>oh no, definitely not. My post was written with the assumption that it is the guy who engages in the infidelity. And I had also not looked into the co-occurance of BOTH sexual and emotional infidelity. I thought my post was just a starter<br></blockquote>actually, i think your post was equally relevant to both parties and i think in the long run, physical infidelity would lead to emotional infidelity and vice versa. i think anyone involved in either should stop and concentrate on their rightful love in their lives.<br><br><blockquote><br>However, I do think that if a person is being seduced, he has to be responsible for "allowing the other party to seduce him". If the person cannot control himself at the first attempt of seduction, then i would say he belongs to the "cannot control themselves" category.<br><br>On the other hand, if he is being seduced consistently, he can by all means avoid it by telling the other party off or avoid interaction with that person altogether. If at the end of the day, he is still being seduced, he would have to be responsible for being a "willing party".<br></blockquote>sometimes it is not as easy as you think, feelings tend to creep up on you and constant exposure to temptations do weaken oneÂ’s will. he/she may have been unwillingly seduced, he/she knows that it is wrong and yet cannot help himself/herself, it is a lousy excuse of course. take for example, colleagues, if your female colleague is dead bent on seducing you, there is no way you can avoid interaction and even if you tell her off, she may not heed your words. some gals are like that, they wouldnÂ’t mind being mistress or lovers just because they like.<br><br><blockquote><br>oh yes, this is especially true to females.

            <div class='col-md body'>I also think that physical infidelity will lead to emotional infidelity as once a person has been physical with someone else,his heart will start to detach from his girlfriend as he will be thinking that since i am so physical with this girl for so long,then maybe this girl is the 1 i truely like and maybe i may have made a mistake.In this situation,emotional infildelity comes into the second phase of infidelity and therefore will hurt you more as we love someone using our hearts,not with our brains or our actions as the heart is the object that will contain our love for another person,hope you all get what i am trying to say, <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">))</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi colette,<br><br>i think i do not have the stamina to "focus" on 3 threads at the same time. The "Poly Vs JC" one is killing me, and now ray has came up with the "moral" thread. I think i have to leave your thread since you happened to be the most understanding    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Well, this shall be my last post on this thread.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>sometimes it is not as easy as you think, feelings tend to creep up on you and constant exposure to temptations do weaken oneÂ’s will. he/she may have been unwillingly seduced, he/she knows that it is wrong and yet cannot help himself/herself, it is a lousy excuse of course.<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>yes, you are right. When it comes to feelings, it is a very complex issue. Sometimes we aren't even sure if we are in love. Know what i mean ? You feel "something" for someone, but you ain't sure if it is love.<br><br>Constant exposure to temptation will weaken one's will, i agree. Raindrops can penetrate rocks. So if we know that our will is not that strong, we will have to avoid ourselves from being exposed to these temptations. It is more of "self-discipline". It is like a guy seeing a Penthouse magazine on the table but not reading it.<br><br>But if the Penthouse magazine is alive and can move .... then it may be more difficult for him to resist    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><blockquote><strong><br>if your female colleague is dead bent on seducing you, there is no way you can avoid interaction and even if you tell her off, she may not heed your words. some gals are like that, they wouldnÂ’t mind being mistress or lovers just because they like.<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>yes, some gers are like that, sometimes they are out to earn "extra cash". They start to show you care and concern, start to tou(2) huai(2) song(4) bao(4) .... if i am in this kind of situation, i will tell my wife/gf about it. I will ask her what i should do. Hence we can work it out together instead of me facing the problem myself. If there is a need, i may even let my wife know her personally. In some way, this will strengthen my will to resist the temptation.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>but there are also some men who will be seduced by words alone, just like some women who will be seduced by good looking guys with killer bods. and not every man loves soccer or politics. *phew, thank God for that*<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>yeah, that's why your topic is a very subjective one. There are all kinds of people, and there's no way we can generalise them in terms of character and personality. It has to be taken at a "case-by-case" basis.<br><br>And I do belong to the "no-soccer" group    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> though politics is ok but not crazy about it.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>i think either party would start out as friends, and friends share things, through a prolong period of time, one may get used to it and feelings may develop. just like Prof. Higgins s (i think) in the movie Â“My Fair LadyÂ”, he fell for his protagonist just because he got used to her.<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>when one discovers that the relationship is "more than friendship" i think he has to reduce interaction with the girl. It boils down to the question of self-discipline again.<br><br>And the complexity of "emotional infidelity" is that no one knows when it started and no one is sure when it will end (if it ever ends that is).<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>i find it more offensive for my guy to fantasize about another gal while he is with me, whether the infidelity is sexual or non sexual, am i not then a substitute for the gal he actually wants?<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>yes, i find it unacceptable for my gf/wife to fantasize about another guys too. But can we do anything about it ?<br><br>that's why it is very important when it comes to choosing your life-long partner. We should not only choose a person purely on "love" but we need to assess his character. But of course, it is easier said than done.<br><br>I did not watch Eyes Wide Shut, did you ?<br><br>[This message has been edited by LittleMan (edited 25 April 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'd say sexual infidelity. cuz sleeping with someone, kissing, touching describes how much one loves the other... I'd say that sexual is part of emotional. I wont be able to take it if my gf slept with someone else even tho she might have been dead drunk... tells me that she aint that intelligent. That'll fuck up my mind mentally. But I might be able to take it if she had some emotions for another guy... I'd tell her never to talk to him again or I'll just walk out of her life. To me being sexual is an extreme part of a relationship... one should only have sex or make out with someone you truly love.</div>
