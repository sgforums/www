            <div class='col-md body'>I don't know if this topic has been posted before, but I would like to know your opinions, which would hurt you more? To know that your girlfriend or boyfriend (spouses) has been unfaithful sexually or emotionally?<br><br>I think the Net is a great medium for emotional infidelity because across the anonymity of the computer screen, it is so much easier to pour out our hopes, dreams and fantasies to anyone who cares to take the time to respond and there is always the notion that since no sexual transgressions have been made, no one gets hurt and the boyfriend or girlfriend (spouses too) doesn't even have to know about it.<br><br>Er, my answer is no answer but I hope I can get better answers from all the forumites out there. For me, both types of betrayals hurt, with maybe the emotional betrayal hurting a little more, because for a guy to get emotional, he would probably love the other party a little.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would say that emotional infidelity hurt more due to the fact that it cannot be measured,therefore it can hurt more than you are willing to admit,and also wounds of the heart take a longer time to heal as the heart is something that heals easily,but how fast is the healing rate depends up to individual,sexual leh is only physical so once we can forget about the sexual infidelity,it is easier than emotional infidelity   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">))</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I read somewhere that men are more hurt by physical infedility while women are more hurt by emotional infedility.  The reason: men think that women only sleep with those they love so when the women sleep with other people, they are loving those other people.  Women think that men can sleep with just about anyone, but they will only "talk" to those they love.<br><br>I know, blatant generalization.  Pease might agree, though.<br><br>I think emotional cheating is harder to detect and perhaps when I don't know for sure, it won't hurt so much.  But when it gets to the point when I become certain about it, I think it'll hurt as much as physical infedility.<br><br>I thought my reaction would be to cooly withdraw from the relationship because what's the point of begging him to come back to me when clearly I have not satisfied him in some way?  But maybe if I love him I should make sure that he's making the right choice.  The other woman might not be as good for him, perhaps I can be better.  So shouldn't I, supposedly in love with him, save him from his own folly and stay with him?<br><br>I don't know if I can be that strong, though.  The initial hurt caused by betrayal is gonna be a blinding one.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well,i disagree that all men are hurt more by physical than emotional,maybe it's because we have our ego and never really show our emotional side,that's why such presumption is around,but what is not seen does not mean it odesn't exist,eg how do you see the wind?you know its there,but can't see it.Anyway back to the relevant topic at hand,i still believe that emotional infidelity still hurts more for guys and girls,only difference is that guys will never show it due to their ego and ultimately,wounds of the heart tak long time to heal  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">))</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If I have to make a choice, i think emotional infidelity hurts more. suppose you ask your partner,"were emotions involved when you when you were saying those mushy stuff to him or her/ touching him or her/ kissing him or her/ sleeping with him or her/ etc", how would you feel when your partner tells you "no" (assuming he/she is not lying) and how would you feel when the answer is "yes"? the answer becomes obvious (i hope).<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Physicall infidelity does not necessarily mean emotional infidelity,eg a girl could be kissing another guy,but it doesn't mean she is being emotionally unfaithful to you as it could be she just lost her head and reasoning for a second.And emotional infidelity although doesn't mean physical infidelity,the hurt is more as it shows that you no longer hold a special palce in the girl's heart and what we all want is to have a special place in our loved one's heart and if that is lacking,the hurt will be more than physical infidelity  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">))</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i would say that emotional infidelity hurts more, cos depending on the circumstances of the "affair", you can write off physcial infidelity as a one-off thg. for example, he could have been dead drunk, she could have been dead drunk, both could have been dead drunk, it was a one night stand. you can find a million and one excuses for it. and perhaps even believe that it wasn't his fault and that it'll never happen again. so you're safe in your world of excuses.<br>but with emotional infidelity, it's different. he actually LOVES her. he feels something for her; feels enough for her to actually have physical signs of it. or maybe even enough to feel guilty till he confesses. and that really hurts, because not only is he cheating on you, it introduces this nagging doubt that he might not love you anymore. and this is the most dangerous infidelity of it all, esp if they havent consummated their "relationship" yet (implying that it's seriously emotionally based, ie he's not just after her for sex). 'cos that could mean the end of your relationship... completely.<br>so technically, emotional infidelity would hurt more.<br>but thking again, the fact that he cares so little about our relationship and me that he would actually just sleep with someone else based on a physical attraction or because he was drunk (lousiest excuse in the bk) hurts even more. afterall he should know how i would feel/react to this (wont everyone else hurt the same?), and to ignore that all because of a moment's lust? doesn't that just reflect on how much he actually "cares" abt me? abt us? in that way, if he actually fell in love with her, it doesnt sting so badly. 'cos you cant help falling in love rite? if it's really love, if he truly feels for her, you cant say much 'cos that's pretty much involuntary (unless he made an effort to "develop" that relp). however, it definitely hurts a hell of alot more to think he cant even control his base instincts for awhile to consider how i would feel. or worse still, he did consider but lust won out.<br>so overall? i guess emotional infidelity hurts your heart more, but physical infidelity is the real stinger.<br><br>[This message has been edited by xue (edited 23 April 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Indeed Maya. As I said, I believe physical infidelity presumes emotional infidelity. I also happen to think if the guy/gal can use "it was a moment of folly" excuse, then the hurt would be great emotionally.<br><br>Perhaps you have misunderstand when I said the hurt is more in "physically" terms, which I presume for this kind of hurt to happen, the emotional part is already factored into the "physical" one. I assumed that the emotional one does not inolved people sleeping together.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>forex, i know, i know, i wasn't disagreeing on that, i think that is an interesting view.  what i am saying is, with emotional infidelity, it's harder to tell whether he's just "good friends" or whether he loves her.  In the case that he is not confessing, there's always a doubt that he might not love the other after all and maybe the doubt can help decreasing the hurt?  But physical infidelity?  bang, shot right through the heart.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wat xue said sounds logical, but from what i experienced in the past, i still think that emotional infidelity hurts more. the real stab in the heart was when i heard him confess "my heart is with someone else". that really hurts. even when before that there were tell-tale physical acts of infidelity, like him sending her a cyberkiss, perhaps i was in self-denial, and made silly excuses for his actions. but the really painful part was still when i knew that he actually loved her.<br><br>it's difficult to differentiate physical and emotional infidelity, the two often goes together. is it really really possible for guys to sleep around without actually feeling for that person? i'm not a guy, so i dun now. probably when both are dead drunk and dunno what they are doing. but if both are already dead drunk, how do they have sex? hmm..<br><br>[This message has been edited by sparkle (edited 23 April 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>babette,<br><br>"for a guy to get emotional, he would probably love the other party a little."<br><br>surely you jest. are guys so immune to emotions? i think it works both ways, for both guys and gers - that certain emotions (and by this i would mean feelings of fondness quite apart from the sharing of hopes, dreams or what have you) that are s'posed to be reserved for your special other are "given" to someone else. i think this would constitute the more serious kind of emotional betrayal. while everyone can like several ppl at the same time, betrayal or infidelity of the emotional sort prob comes from the sustained entertainment of thots and feelings that go beyond the merely friendly. all this is of cuz vague, and i think necessarily so, cos that special something that is meant only for that special someone is not something i can define. but you'll know it when u feel it. when u realise that u r giving something to someone else in a way that u r not s'posed to be doing.<br><br>this is the difference wif sexual infidelity. here, just once would constitute betrayal. u dun need anything sustained like in the case of emotional betrayal. of cuz sex isn't always just sex. sometimes there are real emotions involved too. so here we would have betrayal at both levels.<br><br>roughly, i have sketched the difference between the 2 kinds of infidelity. but as to which would hurt more, it would really depend on the person being hurt. it is not just the betrayal that hurts but what the betrayal actually means to you. if u value and treasure your emotional closeness to ur bf, then u will wonder what is it abt you that "drove" him to the other person. u will think there is something u lack that is made up for by the other party. and so u will be insecure abt your ability to connect (emotionally) wif ur bf. "what is it that i can't fulfill?", you'll ask yourself. "haven't i listened enuf?", "haven't i tried to understand you?". and more and more you may feel it's something abt you that is wrong or perhaps abt the two of you that cannot be bridged. the more u feel u have been doing fine and that u have been trying hard, the more hurt u will be if there is a betrayal.<br><br>same thing goes for sexual betrayal. how have i not been able to satisfy him? was she better than me? the focus of insecurity is usu on what "i" haven't done or been able to do. but for me, i think that sexual betrayal is more hurtful. the reason why being that emotional infidelity is often reserved to your thots and feelings. but to actually go a step further and carry out those feelings in a sexual act is to go a step too far. the matter now becomes not just betrayal but how u could take that extra step. what kind of person would u be to take that extra step. one who has little control over your actions? one who takes sex lightly? i think a whole lot of questions are thrown up abt how a person is like if he takes that extra step. and so the hurt is multiplied by the fact that the person is other than who u expected him to be. u won't even know who that person is anymore. he would have done something totally out of character. notice the stress here is that he would have "done" sth out of character. not that he "thot" or "felt" sth out of character. and that makes all the difference. i can think of killing someone, but it takes another kind of person to carry it out, even under the most testing conditions. it becomes harder to trust someone like that. what must have driven him to actually carry out his desires?<br><br>so while both kinds of infidelity would hurt (and it would hurt more the more worth u place on emotional or sexual fidelity, and the more u feel u have "invested" in that area of ur life), i think sexual betrayal would cast further doubt (and so potentially more hurt) abt the person u thot you knew and trusted.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>just wondering what constitutes infidelity?<br>once read in a magazine that said that for some people, even not telling your partner about having lunch with someone of the opposite sex is considered infidelity by some. whereas at the other extreme, it's only when you have a sexual relationship with someone else then it's consider infidelity.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sparkle - i've often wondered that myself. whatever it is, ppl don't seem to like to be associated with it or accused of it. from ppl i know (guys) who have in my mind been unfaithful because they kissed (and fondled) another girl, they seem to push infidelity to the stage of sexual union.<br><br>but it's hard to draw a distinction between fidelity and infidelity. maybe because there isn't one to be drawn. only varying degrees of being hurt. but we shouldn't equate hurt with infidelity, altho we usu seem to label that hurt as being "caused" by infidelity.  maybe the focus should be on the hurt caused rather than the label "infidelity". that label does no one any good. it only makes matters worse. imagine a girl who has been hurt by some deeds done by her bf. silly thing is, while talking to her best fren abt it, she begins to ponder whether what he did was adultery or whatever. whether he was being unfaithful. now what would happen if she (and her best fren) came to the conclusion that it was infidelity? the hurt suddenly becomes so much greater. now why should a label cause so much extra hurt? the hurt was already there. will labelling it make it any better? on the contrary it can only make it worse.<br><br>when we focus on the hurt (and not on whether there was "infidelity"), we may be able to see things in a better perspective. for while you may tell your gf that you forgot to tell her you were having lunch with another girl, what would it mean to forget to tell her that you slept with someone? surely we can call both examples instances of infidelity. but which really causes more hurt? maybe in the end we should just focus on the hurt and try to make things better from there.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i have no idea why i'm still thinking abt this at 4am in the morning. but if we simply HAVE to have a working definition of "infidelity", then maybe it is this: to give to someone else what should only be reserved for that special someone.<br><br>going by this definition, i do not eat only with my gf, so eating with someone else (even if i don't tell my gf) is not infidelity. if it WERE to be considered infidelity then one would have to explain the curious fact that just becos the other party happens to be a girl, that that fact constitutes infidelity and not when i dine with my dad or brother or my cousin frank. of cuz, girls like to question your intention of dining with another girl, but then again (looking at the definition) if my intention of dining with another girl doesn't include intentions that should be reserved for my gf, then it is not infidelity.<br><br>i do (or rather should), however, sleep only with my gf (if i do at all) and so sleeping with someone else is considered infidelity.<br><br>hmmm....you think that definition will work? hope so. i'm so proud of myself now i can finally go to sleep. zzzzz...... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
