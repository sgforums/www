            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm i would have to disagree...In singapore, a lot of people are using IRC and it doesn't just included the guai guai ones or the ugly ones....<br><br>There are a lot of really hot girls who just want to make friends...It's anew tool for communication.<br><br>Saying that most girls from irc are ugly or guai is akin to saying that most girls who use the telephone are ugly and guai...And why don't we ever think that most girls who use the phone everyday to talk to people are ugly?...Albeit some are, but what does that matter?...<br><br>The irc is a tool for mass communication so you can bet your laurels that a lot of youth and not so youthful are going to be using it to chat when they are bored or lonely or just want to have fun...and yes a lot of guys and girls do use it (although more guys than girls do this) to buaya girls, it's nto always the case.<br><br>I actually consider some girls and guys I've met thru irc my good friends although they might not consider me so.  But what matters is that you can click and get along with the people you meet with through or on irc...<br><br>Besides, most of the girls I've met so far are quite chio.....right Eerie? kekekek</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I feel that making friends on the net is easy and good way. But I think meeting someone from the net is rather a different way of communicating. There are some people who just can't communicate with each other in the proper maner even they may chat till early morning.<br>But I have actually made a friend through the net, both of us share same interests so it definately easy to get along. He even introduce me to a job.<br>Ultimately, if you really decide to meet someone you know from the net. It will definately going to really different from what you actually going to expect.</div>
