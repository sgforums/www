            <div class='col-md body'>My advice is...<br>Think of 90% of the pple in IRC as ugly(I'm included in that 90% of course!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> ) , and then NEVER put high expectations on how he/she looks like. In this way when you see her it won't be so bad at all.. Of course, any pics of her will help, unless she took it before some nuclear disaster or apocalypse..hehe . And of course, the issue about being concerned about looks, that's another topic altogether..<br><br>------------------<br>"And when my love for life is running dry, you come and pour yourself on me"--- David Gates</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>goodbookmarks: Is a fat person any less of a person than a svelte one? Why should there be discrimination against them? Are you then trying to say that fat people should only try to find happiness with other fat people? That they should be segregated and cut off from the rest of the world, in short, treated like lepers?<br><br>Although I disapprove of people trying to look for a partner on the net in such ways (asking for cute guys to message them), this does not mean that you should criticise her for being what she is. YOU were the one who took the risk in deciding to meet her. GET REAL. You think the world is filled with only goodlooking people?

            <div class='col-md body'>IRC/ICQ is the ultimate tool for buayaing. Period.<br><br>Find out the nick of that cute chick in sch, then msg her/add her to your ICQ list. "Uh i accidentally added u, but since we're at it, wanna intro?" or "hello! I'm bored man....wanna chat? Care to intro?"<br><br>Basically I think IRC/ICQ can be used to get to know ppl better. Same applies for email. It's not as personal as a phonecall, but at the same times, it's personal enough. Very convenient too.<br><br>Picking ppl up? Those who actively seek to chat only with ppl of the opposite sex are losers.<br><br>As for pretty ppl, well think of it this way. If you saw a person who was ugly, would you take the initiative to talk to her/him? Chances are no, unless you were forced by circumstances. BUT AHA! On IRC/ICQ, you don't know how the other person looks (usually) and so your brain figures u have a 50-50 chances of meeting a good looker.<br><br>Coupled with the fact that most good lookers don't really meet ppl they meet on IRC (egos got to their heads "it's kinda lame huh?"), or that they already have enuff ppl wanting to "meet" them, your chances of meeting a person who's good looking are reduced.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>GBM: How much contact do you have with females? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Aside from the super frequent breasts touching your elbow, that is. There are girls in this forum and they might not like the way you represent yourself, although to guys this is normal talk.<br>You have to accept that people react to what you say and what you say is normally very inflammatory to the opposite sex. 'Oversized and fat' and remarks abt fat girls don't cut it with you, will incur instant retaliation from more politically correct individuals.<br><br>So maybe next time you would consider tempering your language so that you don't have to fend off irate PC people.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>And I have to say that I have had BAD(!!) experiences trying to hook gals via the internet.<br>It's good to have a friend to 'recce' that IRC/ICQ date-ee before you go into the 'hot zone'. Of course you have to trust your friend's judgement. The advantage of this is that if its not to your taste, then you can go and watch a movie with your friend. The disadvantage is that if the gal is too chio, then your friend might Potong Jalan before you can even act.<br>*Hiak*<br>IRC/ICQ</div>
