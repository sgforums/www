              <p>I remember this one similar incident while i was cycling home. It happened last three days ago. Since im in the rush to get home becoz my frens told me to meet up for important history project, i cycled as fast as i could, but of course, faster but safer. Anyway, when i was cycling at CCK Drive bridge (near KJE), suddenly thers this guy in his 40s with two toddlers walked in a slow; very uber slow pace, blocking the whole narrow passageway. Since theyre blocking my way, i rang my bicycle bell to alert them that im coming thru, but they dun seem to budge, and still continue blocking the way! I even rang 5 times when i got closer &amp; nearer to them but its still the same!  When i said to them to excuse &amp; move out of the way TWICE, then he carried his children (i think) &amp; when i move past them, he started grumbling at me for no apparent reason! He also shouted at me in chinese (which i dunno what hes talking abt) &amp; i ignored him &amp; continue to cycle home. Y r ppl like that one?</p>

              <p>I remember this one similar incident while i was cycling home.
              It happened last three days ago. Since im in the rush to get home
              becoz my frens told me to meet up for important history project, i
              cycled as fast as i could, but of course, faster but safer. Anyway,
              when i was cycling at CCK Drive bridge (near KJE), suddenly thers
              this guy in his 40s with two toddlers walked in a slow; very uber
              slow pace, blocking the whole narrow passageway. Since theyre
              blocking my way, i rang my bicycle bell to alert them that im
              coming thru, but they dun seem to budge, and still continue
              blocking the way! I even rang 5 times when i got closer &amp;
              nearer to them but its still the same!  When i said to them to
              excuse &amp; move out of the way TWICE, then he carried his
              children (i think) &amp; when i move past them, he started
              grumbling at me for no apparent reason! He also shouted at me in
              chinese (which i dunno what hes talking abt) &amp; i ignored him
              &amp; continue to cycle home. Y r ppl like that one?</p>
