Does this recent change suggest that Pluto is NOT there anymore? Of coz NOT! Pluto is still there just that the astronomers don't want to classify it as a planet anymore.<br><br>The wonderful part about science is that it encourages challenges and updates. With improved modern technologies, we get to know more about the world we live in, and then we can refine our understanding of it. if science does not challenge and update our people, then u should start to worry! We will not know the truth, and probably still thinking that Earth is flat and Sun revolves around us.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>ps &gt; i had to use harsh words to wake u up. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

They were partially right about it. They had to demote Pluto as otherwise they had to "add" over 40 objects to over solar system thus making it to a total of about 50 Planets! Thus its better to just demote Pluto rather and have 8 planets then have over 50 planets.<br><br>Our technology wasn't good enough last time and hence we never knew that there were other objects which were like Pluto except further away from Sun.<br><br>Hence now Pluto joins Ceres (between Mars and Jupiter) and UB 313 as the Dwarf Planets.<br><br>I was interviewed by Straits Times regarding this yesterday =) They will be publishing an article about this on this coming Sunday's paper =) See if you guys can correctly guess my name.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

(How roughly? They never say :/) Pluto's orbit is extremely eccentric when compared in relation with the other planets.<br><br>Its orbit should be clear of other major objects. (What is exactly meant by Major Objects?) Pluto crosses Neptune's orbit.<br><br>The planet should have a certain size? What size again? o.0 Pluto is about 2274km in diameter while our Moon is over 3476km in diameter!<br><br>Also another thing I would add will be the plane of the orbit of the planet. All the planets (pluto is not a planet) are circulating around Sun in roughly the same planes. But our dear Pluto is in its own plane completely. Let me show this in the following picture:<br><img src="http://www.worsleyschool.net/science/files/pluto/plutoorbit.gif"><br>As you can see, the inclination of Pluto's orbit is totally off.<br><br>That could have been another reason.<br><br>But yeah, they should give out proper figures in my opinion.</div>

(How roughly? They never say :/) Pluto's orbit is extremely eccentric when compared in relation with the other planets.<br><br>Its orbit should be clear of other major objects. (What is exactly meant by Major Objects?) Pluto crosses Neptune's orbit.<br><br>The planet should have a certain size? What size again? o.0 Pluto is about 2274km in diameter while our Moon is over 3476km in diameter!<br><br>Also another thing I would add will be the plane of the orbit of the planet. All the planets (pluto is not a planet) are circulating around Sun in roughly the same planes. But our dear Pluto is in its own plane completely. Let me show this in the following picture:<br><img src="http://www.worsleyschool.net/science/files/pluto/plutoorbit.gif"><br>As you can see, the inclination of Pluto's orbit is totally off.<br><br>That could have been another reason.<br><br>But yeah, they should give out proper figures in my opinion.</blockquote>yup i know about pluto's weird orbit and angle. I've been very keen in astronomy since my primary school days ( &gt;_&lt;" that's 20+yrs ago... duh)<br><br>last i checked, they did not want to use size to classify a planet. and the final definition did not touch on the angle of the orbital plane (and imo is a wise choice not to be limited by this). In fact, its not far-fetched to say Pluto is part of the kuiper belt.<br><br>page down to the bottom for the final definition, and also the section on "Criticism of final vote".
