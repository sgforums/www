              <p>1 wrong can result in 2 charges. Law is divided into civil and criminal law. What you mentioned is criminal law. What i mentioned is civil law. Both can co-exist one. So you can sue &amp; claim back the $$ $(civil law) and what you mentioned the police is charge her (criminal law)</p>
