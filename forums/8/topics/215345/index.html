            <div class='col-md body'>This hokkien mee seller at the hawker store in my neighbourhood, he has been there for years. The problem with the hawker stores at my neighbourhood is that they usually close around 4pm, and during dinner time there's nothing to eat.<br><br>So I usually eat hokkien mee, since he's the only one open at 10am and closes at 9pm. He isn't exactly fantastic, but not too bad. I think I started visiting since 1993. When I was back from my first book-out during BMT, the first taste of noodles I tasted comes from his stall as well. He started out alone, then found a helper. Then later I remember a plump lady, most probably his girlfriend helped.<br><br>Then I moved away. When I was back at the neighbourhood, his store was gone. I wondered where he has gone to. The stall was taken over for a while and then owner was changed again.<br><br>Then a couple of years later, he moved back, not to the same stall but an empty one a few stalls away. I guessed the owner took back the stall, so he moved on to do something else until another stall was available. He was in the new stall for a few months before he was gone again.<br><br>Then a couple of weeks ago, i saw him at the same hawker stall with the plump lady, probably his wife now. They were both helping out collecting and keeping the plates.<br><br>Then last week I saw him again, there he was, cooking hokkien mee with his plump wife, the same helper at another stall. I finally get to taste the noodles again, the same taste as it was in 1993, 1994, 95.<br><br></div>
