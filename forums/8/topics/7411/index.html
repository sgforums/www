We've been dating for 11 years...the way I see it, paper qualifications don't play a part in our relationship.  It's communication.  However, if one thinks that because one has a degree, and therefore is more conversant, then it would be a problem in a relationship.  The thing is, don't let academic success go to your head.  Then, it will be easier for both parties to communicate.<br><br>------------------<br>To err is human;<br>to really screw up, you need a computer<br><br>[This message has been edited by GoonDu (edited 17 May 2000).]</div>

Despite of balancing the social requirement and living lifestyle.<br>Everyone is thinking that they will go to secondary school after primary and poly or jc after secondary and etc etc. The main point i am trying to point out is that Cert is not everything in our life. With sufficient knowledge and skills, cert is really a piece of paper to show your success in school life. How do you feel if a degree holder is humbly going in an interview and his boss is just a PSLE holder? Doesn't make any sense,right? But its life that the world is creating. If you can create a life for your own using your own road or path, that is success my friend. And learn what you should but not only studies that is unrelevant to life. People Taking Art and without knowing they can use art to earn money or whatever in their life. They just think that i pass art, i pass my studies.

            <div class='col-md body'>the thing is, most people seem to equate education with maturity, which doesnt necessarily apply in all situations. an educated person is usually matured (but the probability is decreasing every year) but a supposedly "uneducated" person, might not be the direct opposite. qualifications are only a reflection of certain traits and characteristics of a person, not a factor itself. a degree doesnt automatically give you a sense a worldliness, maturity, or sophiscation. not all U grads stay up to date on current affairs. and likewise, a "lack" of education doesnt condemn you to a lifetime of ignorance either. it's the person him/herself, and how they react to the situation, and different environments.<br><br>in the end, the qn lies within you, whether you'll allow it to affect you or not. the problems supposedly brought on by a difference in education, is more a question of different environments. if two people grew up experiencing utterly opposite lifestyles, they dont require a disparity in qualifications to have a communication breakdown. similiarly, putting 2 U grads together won't guaranteed a happy union either.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm presently going out with a guy who only have a ntc2 cert and i'm a undergrad. We have been together for almost 3 yrs. Can't say a very smooth 3 yrs but heck which couples dun have problems. I must admit that my frens and especially my parents are very sceptical about the whole thing.<br><br>But it's sad that pple nowadays especially S'poreans equate intelligence, capabilities or even sense of responsibility to the piece of cert. Why so? Some pple just excel in other ways and in other aspects of life. My bf and I may come from different backgrounds and education levels...but we never run out of topics to discuss etc. I guess most important in a relationship is the personality, level of maturity and level of understanding. I suppose to other people the education thing does affect them, obviously this is a very personal decision. It comes down to what u want in ur life.<br><br>------------------<br>oh well, whatever, never mind...</div>
