Lots of oppotunity to get up close and personal with those "tame and friendly" Shepards which are only about the size of a 13 yr-old kid on average. Safety is always number one in any miltary or govt. organization, so... they're likely to suit in you up in full body baiting gear as they don't be responsible for incidents caused by purely on your foolish inhuman thoughts... but in fact they'll laugh at the sight of you running... or rather approaching for your case, at the attacking dogs. Firstly i'd guess you'd try to "dodge", but no matter how fast you can react you can't beat that of any dog and instead of you trying to pin that so-called m*therf**ker down, you'd be dragged down instead by them as they chew, grip and frantically trying to rip your limbs off. by instinct you'd wanna punch, push, whatever rubbish that comes to your mind to get that dog off you but no matter what, it's not gonna let go unless it's trainer instructs him so. By then you're mind would probably filled with,"OMG! OMG! OMFG!".... i could go on but really... the thought of seeing a fool, like you,  in such a situation makes me laugh silly.<br><br>And don't try to question about what i said, cos i'm in the Dog Unit myself.</div></blockquote>hey~ i'm frm da k-9 unit too~ ^5 lolx</div>
