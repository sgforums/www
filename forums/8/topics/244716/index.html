Why every ICT must cut hair until like goon du? Now hairstyle looks like a kid. Why can't they just give us the freedom to have a hairstyle we feel comfortable with? Very demoralising to think of my hair everyday until it grows long. How to train hard like that? We are neither secondary school kids nor regulars. We have our lives after the 1-2 weeks of stupid ICT. I feel like writing in to newspaper forums. Anyone thinks I should "feedback"?</div></blockquote>you fuc<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>king Agua, they make people cut hair because it is the army and it is supposed to be uniform, if everyone have all sorts of hairstyles then how the fu<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>ck do you have discipline, it will be like a circus. moreover, if during war your head get hit by shrapnel, good luck because the medic wont bother to cut your long hair to sort out the mess.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess there are a few reasons for keeping the hair short...<br><br>1) Image. So as not to look like a motley crew of guerilla army. Which professional army in the world allow their soldiers to keep long hair?<br><br>2) Hygiene. Imagine how dirty your hair will get if you are out in the field for extended periods. Heck, even one day, one night outfield will make your hair as clean as a broom!<br><br>To me personally, I have no problem with keeping short hair cos that has been my style for the longest time. It's neat and tidy. And you can easily style it to look good. Look at all the hollywood stars, none of the guys keep long hair, or not many. While I do not berate your choice of hair style, I personally find having long hair for guys a little sissy. Especially for those who are not suitable for it. But well, that's just me.</div>
