            <div class='col-md body'>Sad to say, yes. It is a social ill.<br><br>There are 2 features in Confucianism which<br>I think are responsible for it being a social<br>ill.<br><br>1) Its emphasis on a strict multi layered<br>social and political hirarchy. And our tasks<br>and duties are stratified into the social<br>class we are in.<br><br>We all do know that in the present society<br>where you see dynasties of social evolution<br>in years (Thank god for the Internet, in the<br>fashion of American Pie, but for a different<br>thing), not decades or centuries. How fast<br>a society/country reacts to social evolution<br>determines how well it can survive.<br><br>We all also know that how responsive a<br>country/society is, is inversely proportional<br>to how many layers of hirarchy is there.<br>A confucianistic society takes too damn long<br>to react to new changes, new tides, and new<br>era. Because it needs to go through too much<br>red tapes before a reaction can be reacted.<br><br>2) Confucianism's obstinate stand that<br>virtues and morality are more important than<br>talents and science. Note : At least that<br>has been socially thought to be so.<br><br>It has caused China to forsake its initially<br>vibrant and exuberant scientific culture<br>(chinese first invented gunpowder and paper)<br>and embrace the practically useless<br>Confucianism.<br><br>Imperial examinations examined on<br>memorization, regurgitation and analysis of<br>Confucianism instead of science and<br>mathematics. Coupled with Song Dynasty's<br>massive demilitarization and subsequent<br>adoption of Confucianism as the national<br>ideology *puke*, Confucianism had led China<br>on a path of self destruction, closing its<br>doors to all foriegn countries, dismissing<br>them as red haired barbarians.<br><br>One can hardly miss a laughter when one reads<br>about how Mongolians successfully conquered<br>China. A civilization starved from technology<br>can hardly stand against Temujin's (popularly<br>known as Genghis Khan) troops which are known<br>for their speed (and their smell, HHAHAHAHA)<br>and ferocity.<br><br>Subsequently, history repeats itself with<br>Manchurians's attack and the ceding of lands<br>to Britain and several other European<br>countries.<br><br>To conclude, Confucianism is nothing but a<br>lie held on by rulers to impose control and<br>order on a big populace. Confucianism has<br>been abused repeatedly to extend the life of<br>monarchies, tyrannies and dynasties.<br><br>It is true that we may be at the doorstep<br>to another stage of human enlightenment, but<br>before we can even advance to the door,<br>every tinge of Confucianism, transparently<br>built in to us or not, must be removed.<br>or not,<br><br>--<br>"We live in dangerous times, when truths and<br>social mores are easily made malleable by<br>education (extension of politics by other<br>means), propaganda and organized brain<br>washing. What you have been taught about<br>the truth or morality is _what_ the<br>_establishment_ wants you to believe, because<br>it extends its own life. Do you even dare to<br>take the extra step to question all those<br>values which you have taken for granted?"<br>- Street Philosophy 1:1  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by ngkaihoe (edited 20 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting start. Let me add another dimension to the above. I do not know much about Chinese history but see the models of political philosophy demonstrated in this case.<br><br>The circulation of knowledge is parallel with the circulation of power. Hence the wider the circulation of this knowledge, the wider the circulation of power. When we think of the establishment (or ruling class if you prefer a Marxist stance) the nature of the ruling class is manifested in the dominant ideology of society. It is the case that dominant ideology embodies the truisms and values of this ruling class such that practices and traditions (what we perceive as pervasive culture) in fact perpetuate the legitimacy of this ruling class hence confirming their privileged status.<br><br>In the case of the Soong dynasty and to an extent the establishment in S'pore (where Confucian ethics are also proudly proclaimed), the ruling class has to insert into dominant ideology moral or ethical codes that will strengthen the validity of its status. Confucianism being a code of behaviour and morality carries in its teachings a programme of ideological compliance via 'respect for authority', 'obedience', 'privileged status of wisdom for elders' etc. to secure politically vis-Ã -vis moral and ethical logocentrism in the societal realm. It is with these logocentrisms that the meanings of philosophical teachings are transformed into pragmatic dominions of control.<br><br>A multi-level hierarchy functions as political valves serving two purposes - first, as a visible yet opaque (you can see it but not behind it) infrastructure of bureaucracy to validate the ruling classÂ’ existence; second, to distil ground level (or proletarian) fissures. As such itsÂ’ institutions become part of societal consciousness, forming this consciousness thus acquiring the ability to manipulate this consciousness.<br><br>Cheers<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The view that confucianism is detrimental to the society just because of some of the pts is too extreme. I did a project 4 mths ago on the topic of whether Confucianism is relavant  to the modern society and the conclusion is that while some of the teachings are indeed outdated there are a lot others which is relevant.<br><br>In the teachings there are 5 main relationships ahnd 10 attitudes to govern the r/ship. The 5 r/ships are : ruler and subject, husband and wife, older brother/sis and younger, father and son(parents and child) and older and younger friend. The 10 attitudes include love in parents and piety in child, benevolence in ruler and loyalty in subjects, gentility in oldest brother and humility and respect in younger etc...<br>Basically it can be summarised into the teachings of (1)ren as in love and charity,benevolence,humanity and love, (2)yi as in righteousness, morality and duty to neighbour and (3)li as in worship, good manners politness.<br><br>of cos, teachings such as the husband rules over the wife is in present times largely unreasonable and insulting.<br>What is happeneing nowadays seems to be that we all are too caught up with the paper and material chase. Virtues are often lost. When teachings of filial piety and charity is being inculcated in us, how many of us know that it is actually a value in Confucianism? We are not giving proper recoginition and due credit to the other values that are promoted. Instead we choose to focus on the flaws in the teachings. I'm not saying that all is good and should be further emphasised but I feel that we should look at the entire picture rather than a microscopic view of the issue. A lot of countries have embrace the teachings for it for a long period including S'pore, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea but the modern significance have lied low. And in S'pore it has serve us pretty well.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Light,<br><br>so do you think that confucian ethics as a complete package still has a place in contemporary society? if you think that some teachings are valid and some aren't in today's society then could you say that the overarching moral philosophy (i.e. the moral ground on which ALL confucian ethics are built on) is somewhat dented since if SOME of its teachings can be invalid, then it is reasonable to assume that the rest of its teachings can be open to suspicion in the near future - depending on how society evolves?<br><br>interested to hear what you think.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>cheers<br><br>[This message has been edited by Terence (edited 20 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>though this kong zi thingy was from ancient china...but some of his teachings and thoughts are still applicable to modern society...<br><br>the basis of confucianism is REN...which is to treat everyone, regardless of nationality, race, skin-color, language, religion, the same way as u treat ur family, frens and fellow ppl...<br><br>look...if this thought is well-etched in all our minds...we will not have killings and massacres (how ya spell tt???) think of wat happened to the hutus and tutsis...the indo-chinese...indians and pakistanis...and recently, china n taiwan...and the moslems and christians in indonesia...if everyone loved every other like their own ppl...i believe there will be less sufferings in the world...<br><br>confucius oso emphasized on self-discipline and family values...and i believe that is oso applicable to today's society...i shall not elaborate on tt...<br><br>by being selective...confucianism CAN and is possible to be introduced to modern society...perhaps it just need more time to make ppl accept it...<br></div>
