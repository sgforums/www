              <p>Tarot Card reading, you can find out more about how it works here :</p>
              <p><a href="http://infinity.usanethosting.com/Heart.Of.God/Tarot/index.htm">http://infinity.usanethosting.com/Heart.Of.God/Tarot/index.htm</a></p>
              <p><a href="http://infinity.usanethosting.com/Heart.Of.God/Hilarion/Hilarion_on_TarotCards.gif">http://infinity.usanethosting.com/Heart.Of.God/Hilarion/Hilarion_on_TarotCards.gif</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for 'fortune telling', generally I'd advise against it, because for fortune tellers who are not spiritually evolved, or are charlatans, their advice to you may do more harm than good.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is only one such Reading ("fortune telling") I would recommend to people who really need advice, and that is the Hilarion Reading. (USD $150... now SGD so strong against USD, best time to do it).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a href="http://infinity.usanethosting.com/Heart.Of.God/main.htm#Hilarion">http://infinity.usanethosting.com/Heart.Of.God/main.htm#Hilarion</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For those interested in the Hilaron Reading, I once shared the following on a forum,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>A friend of mine, Sean, had been plagued with childhood nightmares for many years. In these nightmares, he would be dressed in medieval european clothing, and running for his life from mobs carrying pitchforks and torches. He never told anyone about these nightmares.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Several years ago, he did a Hilarion Reading upon my suggestion, to ask about other issues in his life (eg. relationship). When the Reading was done, he confided in me that he was flabbergasted. In one question for the Reading, he simply asked Hilarion to describe and advise on his past lives and how their karma relates to the present life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Among several lifetimes described, was one in which he was a herbalist healer in medieval europe. Because back then there was much fear and superstition about witchcraft. When his methods were successful, there was jealousy and fear over him, and he was accused of witchcraft. Hilarion described him as running from village to village, hiding in forests, hunted by mobs carrying torches and pitchforks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sean swore he never mentioned these nightmares to anyone, and he never even asked about it in the Reading. Hilarion simply described in in response to a question on his past lives.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is only one example, of how accurate and helpful the Reading can be. Hilarion is a being of such a high evolutionary level, that he has the authority and capability to obtain complete information from all your past lives, and everything about your present lifetime, including why certain things happen, medical conditions, relationship issues, etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I say all this in complete honesty, from my personal experience and that of my associates, Hilarion is quite probably among the highest levels that a human being on earth (ie. in physical incarnation) can access in terms of spiritual and psychological help and advice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS. Hilarion is also one of the higher beings in charge of humanity's scientific and technological advancement, so you can ask him advanced physics, biology, chemistry, engineering, psychology, religion, supernatural, any questions across any field or subject within the realm of humanity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In fact, beyond the realm of humanity is also possible, since many of the gods of the many religions, may be considered to be friends with Hilarion (eg. Jesus Christ, whom is known as Sananda in the spirit world, not just on planet Earth but across the galaxy) or for other gods of other religions (usually Extraterrestrials), at the very least, commonly acquaintances with Hilarion (they mostly know each other 'up there', especially in large scale projects for the benefit of humanity, or work involving other planetary civilizations). In addition, Hilarion has many connections/friends or networks across many planets/worlds in this galaxy, and beyond this galaxy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Feel free to PM me for additional inquiries.</p>

              <p><br>lol...k la its abit like the amt of familiarity n 'bondness' u haf with ur cards bah...im still an amatuer la, so cant say much...still refering to the book n all la...its more of u haf to understand what each card is on a general term, detailed, n how each card relates to the others, to the person n to urself...</p>
              <p>in a way after u do it for some time, u will feel attached to it n like can 'feel' the cards instead of needing to think of it logically n stuff...u will b able to feel what each card says n tells the enquirer...in a way its a form of spiritual energy i guess, but nothing unorthodox or what la...</p>
              <p>tarot reading is fun n enjoying...helps both the enquirer n the tarot card reader to feel better while tarot reading...</p>
