            <div class='col-md body'>Best way to break up is to break up happily and gracefully.<br><br>One have to make their partner understand why the relationship should end. THis would prevent the other party thinking the break up was arbitrary. But if it was arbitrary, why go steady in the first place?<br><br>Well, if the other party understands, good for you. Remain as friends and REMAIN as friends. Dun give either party hope that the r'ship would rekindle.<br><br>If you remain friends, both of you could still remember the past sentimentally and not painfully.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, everyone's been giving pretty good advice. the best thing is to make yourself so busy that you have no time to think about her. but honestly.. you'll always have bouts. when you dream of how you guys used to talk.. how you used to hold hands.. how he calls your name.. how he leaves vms.. how he stammers on trying to think of something to say in vms.. how you love to brush his hair.. how he instinctively knows what you want... how you feed each other popcorn in the theatre.. sigh. i could go on forever. you'll never fully get over it, until you fall in love once again (not look for another gf as a substitute). it's a vicious cycle!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i have gone through that ... anyway the best is to bury urself with ur work. Always make urself busy ,,,, 4 mi, i often think of her when i m alone on the bus. Perhaps u can think of the reason y the breakup n think of the best of the world after the breakup. Think of the freedom n also the advantages to b single. If not get to no more friends especially gals ... better not get into another relationship unless u have totally 4get her  ... All the best man</div>
