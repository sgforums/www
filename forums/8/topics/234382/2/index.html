Everyone posts what they want to say, and it is up to the reader to look through every post made. Whereas in face to face discussions you need to wait for your turn and most often you are only replying to the last person who spoke. This leaves the people with softer voices out of the picture.<br><br>Another thing good about online discussions is that you can refer back to previous posts and ensure that people have been consistent in what they have been saying instead of using trickery to confuse.</div></blockquote>That's why you have a secretary who takes minutes and a chairperson that controls the meeting.
