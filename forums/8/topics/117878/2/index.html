What i am saying is, if your desire is high euff, and you believe well euff...you can be anything!!<br><br>You wanna know some odds? here are them... studies shows that 95pct of the world's pop are underachievers...nothin special...rite? the twist is, of the 95pct, most, if not all have the potential of being high achievers. So what is stoping them? The ans lies inside you....<br><br>Here are some facts you might need to know to attain success....Studies have show that all high flyers have 1 common traits...They all have plans...They all have long term plans and short term objectives.<br><br>You said that sometimes we need to wait for opportunites, timing, circumstances and place...well, 1 word of advice, instead of waiting, why not create it?<br><br>recently, there is a movie about a musician "RaY" he is well...Sucessful...disable? yah...he is blind. How about Richard Brandson? The VirginAir CEO...What disabilty does he have? mmm, he cant read, he cant differrentiate God from Dog...get what i mean? Bottomline is easy...its not what happen to you, but what you do to what happen that is more important.<br><br>Like i said b4...being rich is simple...but not easy.....<br><br></div>

In my opinion, the poor don't choose to be poor but it's because, like you said, they do not have the mindset to take control of their lives and thus, remaining the way they are and usually end up blaming the rich just because they are rich and don't 'donate' to the poor.<br><br>Strange thing is, i've got a "rich dad" and a "poor dad" and I can really see the difference in mindsets between two. Rich dad, being swiss, was sent to Africa (or something, don't really talk to him) when he finished school by his dad with not much $ and had to start his life from there, and now he's managing hotels in Asia. As for "poor dad", he started off similarly but the way he was brought up made him the way he is today; - lazy and doesn't know how to manage his finances. Yes, he is nice but he couldn't even support himself.<br><br>Just my real-life experience that the mindset is important.</div>

It never come easy.. BUT what differentiate them from you are : they DARE to try.. Many don't know the amount of time, leg work, preparation, negotiations and paperwork those business man have to go through just to close one deal when they are first starting out..<br><br>They start work early in the morning and finish work passed wee hours, where-by sleep is often a luxury.. some may have failed but their entrepreneur spirit deserved compliment from me.. They are " stronger " than YOU in the sense that they willing to take the first step however grey the situation is..<br><br>It will be the joke of the century if Im being run out and down by a few meek posts.. I feel my time is more precious than to reply to certain post with little constructive contribution..<br></div>
