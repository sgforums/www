            <div class='col-md body'>Where 90% of the world's millionaire had make it by profession in sales, we can't ignore the fact that sales is the way to go in the next century.. Are you a sales-person ? Everyone of us are capable of making a sales.. when you are working for a company, you are making sales of yourself to that company..<br><br>You sell your time to them and earn a salary.. when buying things or ordering food, you are making a sales too.. so you see, each and everyone of us are capable of making a sales.. But how many actually use sales to make money for ourself ?<br><br>How good are you at sales, when the usual property agents sell home that goes - this is the living room, that is the kitchen, that room is bigger thus more space for the kid..  NOW.. if you are selling using the conventional way, do you think it will sell ?<br><br>I have a friend in his 30's trying to sell me insurance.. he goes - this policy good, can make investment and at the same time insure yourself.. You can opt for monthly or yearly premium.. I asked him, " Is that a lIP ? " No, No came the reply.. It's a term plus endowment plan.. LOOk, I know agent need to earn commission but what's more important is that he should know what his client needs instead of just pushing so as to close a deal..<br><br>I had seen how many sales-person explode only to fade away in the long term.. SO what makes you a success sales-person ?? A success sales-person normally process good communicating skills, he must be a good moltivater.. willing to accept feed-backs and display professional attitude..<br><br>Example : Mr wong, LOOK, I just found an apartment that's just right for you and your family.. It's extremely rare and it fit nicely to your budget..<br><br>For selling insurance : Mr wong, LOOK, medical expenses are going up as equipment and techology are more advance.. by taking up this policy it will safe-guard your future.. By paying a small premium every month, you can have the peace of mind.. same goes for your son's education and savings.. You should know savings in the bank doesn't yield much interest these days..</div>
