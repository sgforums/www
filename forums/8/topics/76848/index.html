Apparently, he was insane or something. Every now and then he will be at the Play Ground beside the coffeeshop fighting and scolding. I don't know who he is fighting or scolding though. He would be punching, kicking and scolding at nothing or should I say at the air around him. The first time I saw him was late at night, I thought some drunked people broke out into a fight or something then I realised he was all alone.<br><br>I often see him when I return from school until when I graduate from Primary 6, I never really went there very often.</div>
