He actually went to Guang Ming Peak and challenged the fighters there .. and won. There is some speculation he crossed swords with Dugu Qiubai.<br><br>The history of 9 Yang differs according to the edition of Jin Yong's books. The first edition it was compiled by Da Mo, the later editions it was just found in the Buddhist scriptures.<br><br>Correct me if I'm wrong.</div></blockquote>Hmm... But Jiu Ying dont possess any swords techniques right? Boh hua fight bare handed vs Du Gu's sword  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  Or maybe DuGu already not using sword when he reached his peak  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>seriously, even if he did cross swords with DuGu QiuBai he couldnt have won.
