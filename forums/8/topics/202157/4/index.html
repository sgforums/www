And he tells fellow evangelicals that opposition to evolution undermines the credibility of faith.<br><br>But scientists are probably the tougher audience.<br><br>According to Nature, the science weekly, 'many scientists disagree strongly' with Collins-style arguments and critics feel 'more talk of religion is the last thing that science needs'.<br><br>As a medical student, Dr Collins wondered why patients who were suffering and dying retained faith in God.<br><br>He realised that as a scientist, 'you are not supposed to decide something is true until you have looked at the data. And yet I had become an atheist without ever looking at the evidence whether God exists or not'. </strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>many people tend to think of science as purely formed by lab, beaker, tube and steamming liquid and an old professor... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>they ignore the rationality that become the backbone of our modern science for these centuries, scientists are skeptical about everything on earth, and there were some scientists tried to prove GOD DO exist but they failed, therefore, scientists CAN NOT prove if GOD exists, and it DOES NOT mean GOD exists, scientists just DO NOT know about this issue (so now you understand the logic of science?).  on the other hand, have any priests tried to prove GOD DO NOT exist for the sake of searching the true knowledge rather than only reading ancient scrolls? Well, by reading The Bible, most of the priests claim GOD DOES exist (and again, you have understood how church works?)<br>anyway, science rules, and let the religion to be the side dish, i have no opinion about this... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Mind you, no Modern Science existed at that time. By the way, if you need definition of Modern Science, google it!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
