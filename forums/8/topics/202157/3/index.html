There is no such thing as "perfect". U can't have a "perfect" computer or a "perfect" person or a "perfect" knowledge. Even god who is known to be unfair and merciless is not "perfect". However science has shown itself to be very accurate and precise. They can capture the truth so well that workable complex devices can be made due to the knowledge that science give to us. If u doubt about science, then u should be doubtful about these devices made possible only by science. How do we know the high rise building won't collapse ? How do we know the computer won't explode ?<br><br>After this, probably some people will start to talk about "coffee" is shown to treat bla bla bla then recent studies show it cannot do such bla bla bla. Please note the difference between claims, hypothesis and theory, laws etc. A lot of "claims" and "hypothesis" r made by scientist who want instant recognition but they r studied by other scientists who can very well rebuked the result. For theories and laws that had stand the test of decades of critisms and test. They become very accurate and unlikely to deviate from the truth.

Maybe u r right, he is just having a mental illness and he made up the whole thing about god. However according to your scripture, god did communicate with men before and tat already show he is not "intangibe" ?

            <div class='col-md body'>I've followed with much amusement on on the thread has deviated into yet another science vs. religion showdown. Strangely enough the topic is about unifying science and God.<br><br>Some early posters responded with sweeping rhetorics asking scientist to define life or generally debunking the work of scientist saying "oh we can't explain that blah blah...".<br><br>One particulary delusioned poster argued the the existance of God using circular logic.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  You know who you are.<br><br>The journey of science begun with the desire learn all about who we are, what kind of universe we live in and ultimately, why are we here. Religion and science share the same goals in this respect - to make sense of our existance.<br><br>Scientific studies started with the realization that things happen in a predictable manner when other factors are constant. Ie. the sun rises every morning regardless of the absence of sacrifices made to the sun god.<br><br>From there, man proceeded to chart the motions of planets, understand gravity, energy, electro-magnatism, atoms etc etc. But how do we know that all these arent rubbish? Like stupidissmart has pointed out, the whole system of science is self checked and regulated constantly. A theory has to be proven by repeated experiments to become a law. Only very rarely has a scientific law been revised. For example, Einsteins relavistic version of gravity differed from Newtons, even then, the Newtonian system is still very accurate and remains in use for all manners of calculations.<br><br>Some of you might have heard that mankind is on the verge of discovering the Theory of Everything. A set of laws that will explain creation, evolution and possible destruction of the known Universe. This may sound repulsive to the more religiously inclined members here. If a Theory of Everything exists, where does God fit in?<br><br>If God exsists, that means that he had a hand in the Theory. However, that also means that whatever God does in our Universe, he will be limited to within the set limits of his own rules. This is akin to the question of whether God create a boulder so heavy he can't lift it up.<br><br>Wait a second, if theres a Theory of Everything, then everything is predictable and pre-ordained? Worry not, the Universe is not deterministic, and never will be. Heisenbergs Uncertainty Principle dictates that we cannot simultaneously know the precise location and speed of a particle. That is because when we observe a particle, we have to shine light (a photon) on it, and this photon will cause a change in the speed of the particle. Thus, we will never be able to accurately predict where it goes. Perhaps God can influence the Universe through this 'loophole', pretty odd though.<br><br>It is also possible that God wrote the rules and set the initial conditions of the Universe, letting it evolve without further intervention (much more likely than the above). Of course thats assuming that the Theory of Everthing cannot explain its own existance.<br><br>A number of more fanatical religious followers might even consider it heracy for man to be questioning creation. But I put it to them that if God does not want us to be poking our noses into his work, he would have hidden it from us instead of gifting man the reasoning capacity to unlock such mysteries.<br><br>Think about it.<br></div>
