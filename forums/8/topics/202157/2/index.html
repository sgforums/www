            <div class='col-md body'>Many a times people like to look at this world based on our point of view. Like for example alot of questions like, why Children died of cancer? Why deform babies exist? Why some child are born with low IQ, why this and that, this and that. Its not difficult to think that God doesn't exist because all does things happened. But to be frank all the answer could be answered if People look at it in the point of view of God himself. God set the setting of our world and let us roam as and when we like. Just like one day you decided to have some fish. You set you a fish tank. Added some fish to let it grow and multiple. Soon the fishes grow numerous. They killed each other for food, done some stupid stunt sucked into the filter and shred into pieces.  They become so dirty and shit all over creating all the bacteria and germs dirty the water, and died of sickness which they created. Hmmm what are you gonna do?<br>Use your almighty hand to save them!? If you does that they will only take you for granted as proven in the bible then where comes the thing as faith. How do you gonna differentiate the Good and the Bad that you gonna keep and throw?<br><br>This world is just a testing ground for better things to come.<br><br>Its amazing to see how babies are borned from day 1 as a sperm. The human body was so perfect just fit. for the intended task. You be amazed if you watch the documentary. To tell me that all living things comes from Stones is quite bizarre.<br><br>Further more have you seen Naked science on Discovery channel? There is alot of things which  are supernatural and yet Science couldnt prove. Example Telepathy powers. And it existed.</div>

Our current actions and its future results are compounded of several causes and will result in compounded results. All things in this world are inter-dependent and in constant change. Hence the Buddhist defination of Karma is logical and science can always attest<br><br>Reincarnation, or rather rebirth can be proven. No doubt it is not accepted by the scientific community. Lookup in google Dr Ian Stevenson, who is a leading professor into the research topic of rebirth.<br><br></div>

To entertain himself?<br>God, if he is indeed almighty, HAS NO NEED for you.<br>You, becoz of fear and psychological dependence, are NO DIFFERENT from a CAVEMAN 2 million years ago. YOU NEED a "GOD" for your own sake.<br><br>Therefore it is easy to see that in reality:<br>God don't need Men<br>Men need God<br>So Men created God for his own needs.<br><br>Its no coincidence that over 95% of the smartest men (incl scientists) do not believe in a Creator God. Ask yourself why they dont.<br><br>By the way, its funny to see so many people who have no idea of science talk about it as if they really understand. Even if scientists can explain the union of sperm and egg u can ask where's the soul/spirit blah blah this will never end.<br><br>How many of u ~REALLY~ know about big bang? u think its like an explosion dont you? if so, YOU'RE WRONG.<br><br>It's true that science cannot answer EVERYTHING. Mystical stories (aka religions) can ALWAYS answer EVERYTHING without any need for proof - easy for them. while our scientists crack their brains day and night, story writers dont need to do that.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>p.s &gt; people who still question evolution live in ur own world.<br><br></div>
