            <div class='col-md body'>well, basically, i would like to know more about the courses a polytechnic offers....<br>and about the JC courses, there are only two streams right? Science and Arts. so my question is, whether is it possible for me to choose Double Maths, Geography and Literature? my interest is not in Science, and neither am i good in it. I wouldn't mind doing Economics, but i would prefer doing Geography to Econs. JCs do not offer the combination that i would like to take right? so how???<br><br>fellow forumites, please do enlighten me......as my parents are asking me to go into the science stream and take double science, double maths. which is what i really don't wish to do.....would rather go arts stream if i can't do the combination i want.....<br><br>[This message has been edited by t|rEd (edited 06 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I can tell u what poly courses not to take.  My cousin who graduated with Biotech dip 5 yrs ago say the prospects are not good... About 70 percent of his graduating class are no longer in Biotech jobs cos poor job prospects, disillusionment with future as a lab technician (many even b4 they graduated)...The top student of his year is now an SIA girl...lecturer very dissapointed in her.<br><br>Shipbuilding seems pretty poor choice for career too.  cos the industry is moving to India &amp; China.  but this is the opinion of one elderly (still)retrenched worker so I can't confirm as a whole for fresh grads.<br><br>The hotel &amp; toursim industry is declining in SG.  If you've seen Marco Polo, Cairnhill Hotel, that hotel opp SCGS &amp; soon Garden hotel will be making way for condos &amp; svcs apartments. Penang appears to be picking up cos it is cheaper &amp; has just as good food as us.<br><br>Anyway my friend from NTU, degree in  Hospitality or Toursim (I forget which one) says the Hotel industry people often treat Degree &amp; Dip holders badly cos oftentimes these people have little qualifications but thru sheer determination, worked their way to management positions.  So they feel very "threatened" when fresh degree/dip join the industry.<br><br>well I hope this can help some people...<br><br>aaargh ! is the future IT ???  how far can the industry expand ?  will the bubble burst one day ?  cos my brother is thinking of doing comp sci in Australia.  Anyone can cooment on this ?  Anyway I choose Business Ad.  what I m familiar with I guese...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yah wat..there is no more commerce stream starting yr 2000...govt withdrawn it from JC liao...it was announced 2 years ago...i think is bcos they wanna sort of concentrate the commerce in the polys...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wonder why they want to take off commerce stream also, then the JC students will have less choice to study. Anyway, I think that the government is going to increase the number of people which can enter university from poly, although the increase is not significant, at least the poly student will now have a better chance and better reasons to study polytechnics.<br><br>------------------<br>Zhi~</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i'm a poly student taking an electronics engineering course and i'll be graduating in a few weeks time!<br><br>3 years ago i was in JC for the 3months before the O level results came out. i wanted a taste of JC life and i found it quite unsuitable for me.<br><br>1)i went there with no A maths and pure science background and i felt that i was at a great disadvantage cos if i wanted to take C math i would have alot of catching up to do.<br><br>2)if i did not do well enough for my A levels to get in to the U, then i would be in deep shit. but with a Diploma i can get some good job for a start.<br><br>3)i did not see the point in studying all the theory. i mean like, how many percent of the stuff you learn in JC will be used in future? lets say if you go into the IT business you won't be using much MATH let alone Physics and Chemistry. all the learing would be a tremendous waste of time. you want to take psychology? then why waste your time on futher math or any other math for that matter!? right now i've forgotten all my o level chemistry and the only thing literature has done for me is that i appreciate movies and books more than ever before.<br><br>i decided to choose poly cos the skills learnt here are marketable skills. if you want a fast and relatively safe path to the U then stick to JC.<br><br>however i have done quite well in Poly. i think my results are good enough to get me a place in NTU or NUS (i heard a B average will do but i think you'd have to get more than just Bs   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">). and dig this! if i stick to my field of studies i can start in the 2ND YEAR! saving me the first year of having to study useless general stuff!<br><br>[This message has been edited by Ticonderoga (edited 10 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>NJC is not unique, other JCs offer odd combinations too. The main deciding factor is actually Cambridge. The simple reason being exam timetable clash.<br><br>My bid to take History and Chemistry together was foiled due to clashes. Honestly, I really can't think of what you can do with double maths, geog and lit. I think that the timetable will probably clash. Besides, what kind of job do u want?<br><br>What kind of skills does that combi offer u? What will u do in university? Engin? u can't, no physics. the only majors i can think of available to that combi is geog, political science, maths, computing and mebbe a few others.<br><br>mebbe one of the poly courses will be more relevant to u.<br><br>oh yes....psychology in NUS requires passing the Psychology aptitude test<br><br>[This message has been edited by Altrex (edited 10 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thanks for all your comments. =)<br>but wat courses can i take in Poly? i don't like science, and i can't do well in it. was in pure science, then dropped to combined science. have no confidence of doing well in science. anyway, my teacher said that to take psychology, going into the arts stream is more suitable. ok, so i may not necessary be going into psychology in the future, but i do really like literature and maths so much....that is why i hope to study double maths, and i don't want to  give up the chance of being able to study literature. it seems like a waste, learning literature for four years, then giving it up.......sighz............</div>
