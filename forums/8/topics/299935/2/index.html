            <div class='col-md body'>for those who snort at the pay rise..<br><br>do you have any idea how many hours the average teacher work per day?<br>inclusive of lesson planning, marking, event planning, administrative work, training, counselling students, telephone conversations with parents, CCA, competitions, sports day, meetings and etc? Divide those number of hours with their average pay per day, and you would realise that they are really paid pittance.<br><br>MOE teachers are under a great deal of pressure and emotional stress - from the ministry, from their bosses, from the kids, from the parents - all of whom have their own agenda and different expectations from them. They are expected to fulfill all these expectations as best as they could.. and somehow in that process, actually TEACH the kids something.<br><br>Seriously! Money can't be the sole reason why they are putting in so much work - but does that mean they don't deserve to be paid for it? Just because they do it for passion as well - does that mean they should get less for their work? How does that work out?<br><br>I'm not an MOE teacher but i appreciate that its a tough tough job. And like one of the posters above said, even 80k a year can't equate with the duress they have to go through.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As much as I have to admit that there are some of my teachers whom I actually dislike, I have to say that this pay hike for teachers is the most justifiable in the entire civil service. (compared to ministers and other sector pay hike)<br><br>Teachers nowadays definitely face tougher challenges than what was faced ten years ago, this is from all aspects. Firstly are the students. Many students today are simply rude and disrespectful towards teachers. They give teachers an emotional test. Secondly is the demand of the work itself. Today, teachers have to do work planning and reflection, stay back for remedials even for lower primary students and sacrifice their personal time.<br><br>From my own experience, my teachers when I was in Upper Secondary, their sacrifice for us is simply extraordinary. My Math and Physics teacher used to stay back until 6.30PM just to help us in case we have questions. My Language teachers gave us their phone numbers and did not hesitate to offer us help should we need one even during the weekends. They were always trying to help us while balancing their time with meetings, plannings and for most of them, their family. Though it is a 5 day work week, many are willing to come down on Saturdays just to help. Officialy, their work hours are 7.30-2.30, many are at school by 6.30 and leave at the very least, at 5.00. This is true even for Primary school teachers.<br><br>A teacher's job isn't as simple as it was before. Parents today are "more difficult". The school management demands more from them. They make a lot of personal sacrifices. And don't forget about the CCAs. I say, if there is indeed any group of people who deserves a pay rise, they are the ones.<br><br>I'm not an MOE teacher by the way.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i agree with you that a salary raise is not the best way to solve the problem but I don't see how a raise in salary would be equal to <span style="font-style: italic;">'corrupting the spirit of education with money</span>".<br><br>With regard to teacher's bonuses being linked to performance: I think that makes total sense! I mean, what other quantifiable way can you measure a teacher's contribution? You can't 'measure' the character impact that a teacher has on a student!<br><br>It pushes teachers to become more creative in their teaching because that's the only way students can learn better. As a teacher, you can't just say, hey look, I stand here 6 hours a day giving good lectures to these kids ok, its not MY fault they don't learn! A teacher has to FIND ways to understand why the kids aren't learning, aren't motivated to learn, and then find out &gt; this part of their job translates to better results!<br><br><strong>So Question:<br>If a person is a HIGHLY effective teacher - creative, interesting, motivating - does it mean he deserves less bonuses if he is doing it simply for the money? Does working for money makes doing a good job, LESS good?</strong><br><br>It is the Ministry's job to ensure that teacher's performance should not be measured solely on meeting 'targets' like salesmen. That should be the crux of it, rather than whether teachers 'deserve' bonuses linked to their performances or not.<br><br>I don't understand why you feel that running a school like a corporation is bad - as long as the school understand the fundamental importance of their product - QUALITY education - and make achieving that standard the focus of their staff. Why is that bad?<br><br>Secondly, I love the suggestions you made about it, and i am sure lots of people also hope that can be done. But the reality is in order to ACHIEVE that and maintain a good quality of education - you probably need at least double the number of teaching staff that is currently employed right now. Which means double the tax that goes into paying double the staff and an astronomic increase in school fees. &lt;&lt;-- and MONEY would definitely solve THIS problem.<br><br>Imagine the outcry THAT would cause.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Rock^Star:<br>[b]<br>Therefore, will the teacher truly tranfer knowledge in his capacity as an educator or for selfish reasons then?<br><br>Something must be done about the way schools are run (like corporations) and teachers' workload must be reduced.
