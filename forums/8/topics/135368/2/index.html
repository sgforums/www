So tis is a message to them!!<br><br>btw, ur "skinny ppl also like to eat" is totally irrelevant????

Are u a lawyer??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Let me repeat. The whole point is, when FAt ppl are ENJOYING their tons of food and snacks, we gain NOTHING out of it. But then they take up more space and make it inconvenient for normal users. Tis is the thing tat irks me. Pls go lose weight. Slightly broad no problem, its from Fat to very FAt... prob those 90-120 kg type on a normal frame.<br><br>And its not even healthy to be fat!! So its TOTALLY NON-BENEFICIAL to anyone, including themselves, so I am flaming them.<br><br>I agree kids do cause a nuisance too, in trains and in cinemas.. their parents should indeed do their best to wathc them. But kids being kids, they are not really mature enuff to know wat they doing rite? Sometims beyong parents control oso, wat can they do? wahck them in public? cannot rite...<br><br>Old ppl, no choice, all ppl get old. They cant do a single thing abt it but life muz go on, so they still need to go out.<br><br>But Fat can be dealth with!!<br><br>As for muscle bound, well, they still dun take up as much space as fatties, and there are SO MUCH FEWER musclebound ppl ard that its not causing a major problem at this point. </div></blockquote>regarding children i was saying that the are the products of pregnancy and thus their trouble is the trouble caused by pple choosing to be pregnant therefore its a problem. no idea why you suddenly went into th children maybe you misunderstood<br><br>no i not lawyer wish i was if iw as i can earn money much mroe easily<br><br>ahem first you say the fat pple enjoy themselves then you say they do not benefit? contradictions in terms.<br>actually they do benefit us, they are subsidizing your medical fees. hey 90-120 on normal frame i assume normal frame is 1.7m? well actually you can reach 90+ and still be ok in terms of space usage. actually muscle bound can take up alot of space maybe you haven't really seen yet. and while they are not prevalent doesn't mean they should be discounted or ignored since they fit into your description<br><br>in the end its where you want to draw the line at discrimination, so i guess you are entitled to your views although we all want to beat you up for yurs<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> . i can actually say if you are not rod thin you are taking up extra space too if i want to</div>
