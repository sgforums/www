They also occupy more space leh....</div></blockquote>Actually the point is not juz Fat people, its just the principle of why should we suffer for other ppl enjoyments.<br><br>It's like sometimes when ppl see a Big Mercedes trying to parallel park but can't get in, they feel obi-good, cuz the owner hiao, want to have big nice car and look rich (yes, they are free to do so), so when have problems on e road, its their choice wat? they deserve it. No double standard.<br><br>Fat ppl eat and enjoy; we get nothing out of it. But when they bump into us and squeeze thru, and when sit down next to u, it take up so much space, its so blardy irritating!!  So I dunno why there is so much fuss abt Fat ppl shouldn't be discriminated against.... if Fat was a genetic or social condition, then yeah, it would be unfair. Like poor ppl, some are unlucky tats why poor. We should help them.<br><br>But Fat ppl? Their own choice!! Dun complain when ppl discriminate or say stuff like "Nobody want to date a fat chick/guy etc". You can change it around.<br><br>I'm not saying here tat Fatties are bad ppl or wat, I'm sure many are nice. But in general, dun keep blaming others or geting so blardy defensive abt being fat or pretending to be proud as a fatty cuz its unhealthy and u're wasting our land space.<br><br>Like I say earlier, imagine ppl start to not wipe their ass and not bathe for 10 days. Its a lifestyle choice wat; like overeating! Then when they sitting next to u on e train and bua against u, u will be happy? Juz becoz a lot of ppl are fat dun mean it shouldn't be dealth wif.<br><br>More TAF club plz!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>
