            <div class='col-md body'>This is meant as a comment or personal opinion....<br>I'm sure everyone has read the forum page or read these forum threads and i have came a cross really nonsensical respondses...<br>Is it because singaporeans like us do not know anything outside of our books? Or is it because us singaporeans are just contributing to the noise by saying or telling facts and opinions already in the news?? Or is it purely because, the government does not permit us to speak about some "awful truths" ???<br>and I have came across my friends not knowing what is happening in the world outside... I'm a teen and i atleast have a grasp of what is happening in the world today... many of our teenagers today are very narrow minded and they don't see the big picture... If you were to walk up to a random teenager on the strets, and ask them about the medan air crash, you'll more or less get this answer: "Huh? What's That?", "What Medan Air crash?". and when you question if he/she ever watches the news, you might very well get these answer: " *cheeky laugh* No, never", "Got! I Got Read Newspaper! (Probably the life section)" or even "Oh sorry, maybe not in yesterday's paper". It's intresting how teenagers react, they don't care about what is happening out side and perhelps it's becauseof their pride, they lie that they do...<br><br>In conclusion, the questions that i want to post to you forumers is.......:<br>Do you agree that teens today are narrowminded?<br>Do you agree that some singaporeans are just purely "contributing to the noise"<br>Would you encourage talking about world news / politics/ religion almong you friends??<br>And off cause do say whatver you want... just no nonsnsical opinions...
