            <div class='col-md body'>This is how a phone's firmware works.<br><br>As long as you attempt to reset the IMEI number, you will need to erase its entire memory unit. If the manufacturers really collected all old phones and repackage, it will not even bother to specifically change the IMEI. In fact they will just reinstall the entire firmware and os. And the chances of a glitch occurring is really really low.<br><br>However, if the repackaging was done without manufacturers knowledge, like for example private shops in spore and JB, then this kind of things could happen. But why will Singtel sell this kind of phones.<br><br>So either the woman is lying for some benefits, or she got the 1/10000000.... chance to be that unlucky.<br><br>p.s. Many ppl interested in Sharon here. If i were her, i would definitely get in touch with the woman who called me and check out how my stolen phone got into the hands of Singtel. If news report even better. But why she hide?</div>
