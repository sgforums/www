              So much written about Babas and Nyonyas and by non Peranakans.  The Babas  and Nonyas  are a lost  ethnic sub group! In the days of old Babas and Nonyas tended to marry within their own community. 
              
              The first migrants to the far east were only men  from southern China. Many did return to China, but some never did  and instead married Batak women  from Indonesia. The Bataks were not Muslims.  
              
              As for the purported legend about Princess Hang Li Po  and Admiral Cheng Ho. It was unlikely that  Parameswara who was then a Hindu Prince before he converted to Islam and became Sultan Mansur Shah, made Hang Li Poh  a Fatimah or Zubaidah binte Abdullah!  But some  in Melaka wil tell you that Hang Tuah and Hang Jebat and Hang Lekir  are all descendants of the  Princess Hang Li Po .
              
              There is also a difference between being a Straits born Chinese and being a Baba.  Many who claim to be Baba or Nonya are actually only Straits born Chinese , educated in English  and anglophile in behaviour . They do not even speak the Baba patois like th e true blue babas and nonyas!

              <p>they are still considered illterates today if they cant read and understand what is happening to them.in fact nowadays if they cant understand if they are being conned n what is in it for them then its worse than being an illiterate....its .more like stupid.and being stupid or gullible believing everything  from a conman is the real deal then its worse than being an illiterate.atleast being an iliterate,u could goto school n buck up but still am able to reason what why how etc etc.</p>
