              <p>Possibly the worst analogy in all of sgforums. Even those 'warrior type or scholar from China' are not alive today, and their descendants do not have qualities of warriors nor scholars, unless you believe LKY's ideas about eugenics. <br><br>In humans, these things are not even genetic, let alon inheritable.<br><br>I don't know why, many people in Chinese culture are ancestor minded. They talk about how their ancesters were great intellectuals, and great warchiefs and what not. If they were taking after their ancesters, which they are not, why are the so useless and have accomplished and contributed nothing good? </p>

              <p>anyone can say its updated n they have the best stuff.....guess u have to prove it.afterall no one is gonna read yer books,they would rather believe a 1 hour documentary by BBC,scientists, etc etc and Times magazine.</p>

              <p>im not saying about this weird experiment on transfusion which is somewhat .........unneccesary and does not make sense to anything at all.</p>
              <p>what im saying those ancestors of spore who came to spore as superstitious sailors and illiterate labourers might not give the much scientist,engineers or doctors and even if they did its like playing with a probability figure where their smarter ancestors thoudsands of years ago  have the gene suddenly working today  producing  better inventors who build everything from airships,computers,warp drive engines and stuff u wont hear until 50 years later.</p>
              <p>what im really saying is those ancestors could produce ignorant and indifferent citizens of today who are unable to figure out simple meaning of existence without killing one another n giving out great agony in the process.im not even sure they can handle a simple vote properly without being cheated again n aggain.</p>
              <p>I have worked in most MNC companies that are setup by geniuses n inventors and its surprisingly easier to breathe even though they are producing billions of dollars a year without effort as compared to those companies built by no nonsense serious methods by people who are normal coolie types and only producing a paltry couplea $100 million or so so range.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>seems like if geniuses are good morally that they can do miracles n give easier time for everyone.however seeing the world where its filled with power mongers and mass murderers,,,even if the world could be improved it will still revert back to a stage where everyine does not investigate stuff n stop n see if it should be carried out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>after all earthlings are the most unreasonable,egoistic n violent people on earth where none has seen peace at all since men started holding a spear.should they be helped by geniuses who will make better stuff to kill n destroy everything again?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i think even if they made geniuses in a factory.....there are many factions who will ensure that it does not happen because they are after all imperfect as humans.</p>

Something funny is that his daughter openly says there is no such thing, and coming from a neuroscientist somemore, lol. This LKY keep saying that he is a Chinese, and therefore his IQ is higher than others, but his daughter openly calls herself and her family peranakan.</p>

              <p>But if Harry Lee Kuan Yew openly, boldly and frankly admit that he is a peranakan and not a chinese at all and carry out his chinese suppression activities, destroy chinese education system, suppress the language of the chinese people, insult the mother tongue of the dialect chinese and talk nonsense that his english policy is to "help" minorities and not help his own peranakan group, the chinese people of Singapore will cut off Harry Lee Kuan Yew's mother fucking head.</p>

              <p>what i write half asleep at 12 midnite or half asleep iosnt as bad as the way u try to reason while u are fully awake at 10pm.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>thus confirms my theory that majority of sporean decendants of ancestral origuns of illterates n muscleheads are unable to reason n thibk properly even when wide awake.thus explaining the curent plight of spore from high cost housing....pathetic salary........poor gov policies  n more sickaporeans,</p>
