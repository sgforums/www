              Peranakans are in some way  an accident of history lah! Forget about the Hang li Poh story .  Chinamen  came to Nanyang because of famine in Mother China . some sold as chue chai  slaves for the plantations In Singapore and Malaya ., Some even became gangsters in the Lurut mines  the Ghee Hins and the Hai Sans....But the very early ones probably  traders or settlers married Batak women and had offsprings - probably the first real Peranakans. Now if you are a half caste- will  any other blue blooded Chinese want to marry you in those old traditional days? So  no choice - the half caste marry the half caste! the children of such unions married each other  and the sub ethnic group - the peranakans took root. But because many of these peranakans were English educated- they rose up socially in the colonial days - and looked upon themselves as "the elites" of the day. And when that happened in the Straits Settlement -suddenly everyone wanted to be peranakan or associated with peranakans. Even those not peranakans but become rich  in the Straits settlements took on the cultural life style of the babas and nonyas and passed themselves off as peranakans.
               Some sinkheks from China later also aspired to marry a local "nonya" -like maybe the kang chu's daughter or the gambir plantation owners daughter....Later on nearer the 1940's poor peranakan families who had lost their fortunes  in the war even sought cina gerk son-in-laws who were wealthy  but without social status -to replenish family wealth in return for elite social status of a peranakan family, thus the "cheo kia sai" (buay teng lang,selling the lantern) rites whereby  the rich cina gerk son-in-law take s on his father-in-laws surname!

              <p>Peranakans were trusted by the british. The british put them as heads of political organisations to control the chinese in Malaya and Singapore. The head of the MCP Chin Peng also spoke of this british tactic.</p>

                          <p>You seem to suggest that peranakans are in some way inferior to
                          pure (i.e. inbred) Chinese. Culturally I would say peranakans have
                          it much better than the Chinese, which is all about greed and
                          oppressing others.</p>

                          I don't stand in judgement of anyone. But I do make a distinction , my perception of the real babas and nyonyas of yesteryears who actually  spoke the baba patois and actually lived  the culturally privilege -lives of  babas and nonyas,  than the present day all and sundry ones who claim baba and nonya connections just because their grandma happens to wear  some sarong ( folded the wrong way) and machine embrioded kebaya  bought from Jonker Street in melaka, and  to occasionally cook sambal udang and chicken curry (albeit actually Hainanese style)! 
                          
                          As for greed and opppressing others- you can find that human failing exist  in almost every group of human beings on earth! Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely regardless  of time  place and people. It was really ironical when a t a recent keeping the place clean campaign ...a budget was announced to make the place more environmental pleasant , and this Minister said ," Money alone cannot buy cleanliness...it is the responsibilty of everyone!"  Almost prophetic ! How true I thought! Indeed how can money  buy cleanliness? On the contrary more often, it is the very tainted stains in itself!

Many have started to build their new lives and there communities in Malaka and modern-day Singapore. In time, they began to address themselves as "Nyonya Baba," wherein nyonya is referred to the women and baba for the men.</div>

As most of them have lived for generations and most have not intermarried with Indonesians, Malays, and other races, the Peranakans held a distinctive custom and tradition that is totally unique to the recent influx of mainland Chinese immigrants.</span></strong></div>

Its etymology is traced back to Hindustani speakers who used it to refer to Chinese vendors and traders, who were mostly male. Nyonyas were referred to the women and this term is Javanese loan word from the Italian "nona" (grandma) and Portuguese "donha" (lady). Since most Javanese referred foreign women as nyonyas, the term were obviously referred as honorifics to Straits Chinese women.</div>

Basically, the Peranakans were mixed-race - part Chinese, part Malay/Indonesian. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Baba Nyonya is a subgroup withing the Chinese communities that trace their descendants to the unique Sino-indigenous unions in Melaka, Penang, and Indonesia.</span></strong></div>

Many Peranakan men took brides from within their local community while some imported brides from China. Some send their daughters to China to find husbands.</div>

Other experts believed that the Peranakans' Chinese ethnicity has hardly been diluted in the racial mixing. Some Peranakans can be distinguished from those with part Malay ancestry and those without any Malay ancestry.</div>

              <p><strong>The Prospect of the Peranankan Community at the Age of Globalization </strong></p>
              <p>   By Tan Ta Sen </p>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen, I felt extremely honoured to be here today to share with </p>
              <p>you my thought on the prospect of the Peranakan community at the age of globalization. </p>
              <p>Being a Baba and Nyonya yourself, I am sure, you are very concerned about the future of </p>
              <p>the Peranakan community. The word “peranakan” is very commonly used in bahasa </p>
              <p>Indonesia than in bahasa Melayu. In the past “baba and nyonya” were commonly used for </p>
              <p>the localized Chinese. Peranakan in fact includes all localized foreigners or their </p>
              <p>descendents. Thus we have the Chinese peranakan (baba &amp; nyonya), Indian peranakan </p>
              <p>(Chitty or mamak-Indian Muslim), Portugese peranakan, European peranakan (eurasian </p>
              <p>or serani).  Melaka is the home of the Peranakans in both Malaysia and Singapore and so </p>
              <p>it is not only appropriate and relevant but also historically significant for me to deal with </p>
              <p>this topic here. Although I am a Singaporean and I am not a Baba, in the past decades, I </p>
              <p>have business concerns in Melaka, and a frequent visitor of  Melaka. Thus, I am virtually </p>
              <p>a local Melakan, live at the centre of the old town and have witnessed the change that has </p>
              <p>taken place in the past two decades.    </p>
              <p>I would like to begin by giving you a few significant glimpses into the history of </p>
              <p>Chinese diaspora as well as the eventual development of the Peranakan community in </p>
              <p>Melaka so as to set the tone of proper historical perspective.  The Chinese have been </p>
              <p>migrating southward from China to Southeast Asia for centuries, driven from their </p>
              <p>homeland by economic necessity, political disturbance, flood and drought. Chinese </p>
              <p>diaspora outside China are generally addressed as Tang Ren (Teng Lang ��) because  2 since the 7th century in the Tang Dynasty, Chinese mariners and traders were engaging in </p>
              <p>considerable international maritime trade, traveling as far afield as East Africa through </p>
              <p>the Straits of Malacca.  They went to mainland Southeast Asia much earlier and they </p>
              <p>were addressed as Qin Ren (��).  However, they were merely sojourners before the </p>
              <p>14th century.  Cheng Ho’s historic seven voyages to the Western Ocean in the early 15th century marked the first wave of Chinese migration to Southeast Asia.  Cheng Ho discovered </p>
              <p>the presence of Chinese settlements in Island Southeast Asia. Three crew members of </p>
              <p>Cheng Ho’s fleet, Ma Huan, Fei Xin and Gong Zhen have recorded their eye-witness </p>
              <p>accounts of Cheng Ho’s voyages to the western ocean in their books.  They witnessed the </p>
              <p>existence of Chinese settlements in Sumatra’s Palembang and Java’s Majapahit, Tuban, </p>
              <p>Gresik and Surabaya. This first wave of Chinese emigration was characterized by </p>
              <p>indigenization (localization) as these pioneers were quick to interact and even </p>
              <p>intermarried with the natives and as a result they were gradually assimilated into </p>
              <p>the local population. However, Ma Huan and Gong Zhen  made no mention of Chinese </p>
              <p>settlement in Melaka but Fei Xin casually referred to some pale-looking people among </p>
              <p>the Melaka residents as the “Tang” people. ”Tang” like “Han” is commonly used to refer </p>
              <p>to the Chinese. Therefore, we safely conclude that there were a handful Chinese in </p>
              <p>Melaka during Cheng Ho’s era and they were too few to form any so-called Chinese </p>
              <p>settlement. As Cheng Ho built an outpost in Malacca and all ships going to other ports </p>
              <p>were required to assembled in Malacca awaiting fair wind to make the homeward </p>
              <p>journey, there were certainly sizable crew members of Cheng Ho’s fleet temporarily 3 </p>
              <p>putting up in the guanchang (government warehouse complex). Ma Huan, Gong Zhen </p>
              <p>and Fei Xin were quite clear about these itinerant Chinese and so it was unlikely that they </p>
              <p>would be confused between the itinerant Chinese crew members who were sojourners </p>
              <p>and the few Chinese residents.   </p>
              <p>The legend of Hang Li Poh has hinted the existence of Melaka’s earliest Chinese </p>
              <p>settlement at Bukit Cina during the Cheng Ho era. Princess Hang Li Poh has long been </p>
              <p>conveniently dismissed by historians as a myth. But I would like to review the Hang Li </p>
              <p>Poh story in a fresh historical perspective. On the subject of Hang Li Poh, in my opinion, </p>
              <p>it was a historical event which might have possibly taken place. When we survey the </p>
              <p>legends of Southeast Asia, especially of Indonesia and Malaya, we often find stories of </p>
              <p>Chinese princesses marrying native rulers. It can be attributed to the fact that China </p>
              <p>throughout history was a great power and a cultural centre surrounded by undeveloped </p>
              <p>native states.  These native rulers would feel extremely honoured to marry a Chinese </p>
              <p>princess as it could enhance the prestige of the native rulers and win the trust of the </p>
              <p>Chinese emperors. During colonial period, it would be great honour for a native to marry </p>
              <p>a white girl. In history, there were many examples of Chinese princesses marrying native </p>
              <p>rulers such as Princess Wencheng who was married to a Tibetan king and Wang Zhaojun </p>
              <p>to a Xiongnu ruler. Hang Li Poh could have been another Wang Zhaojun who was not a </p>
              <p>princess but a maid in the imperial palace. In fact, the Malay Annals’ story of  Hang Li </p>
              <p>Poh marrying Sultan Mansor Shah was an error. The sultan who married Hang Li Poh </p>
              <p>should have been Megat Iskandar Shah (Parameswara’s son). Western scholars were also </p>
              <p>agreeable to this version but mistakenly regarded her as the daughter of a local Chinese 4 </p>
              <p>kapitan. The kapitan system was only introduced by the Portuguese in the 16</p>
              <p>th century but the Hang  Li Poh story took place in the early 15th century. In my view, Hang Li Poh </p>
              <p>was very likely one of the maids in Yongle’s palace. In addition, ‘Puteri” in Malay and </p>
              <p>Indonesian languages may not necessarily mean “princess”. It is widely used as pet name </p>
              <p>for girls like Chinese call their daughters Qian Jin (��) (thousand gold). Historian’s </p>
              <p>suggestion about the story of Hang Li Poh  as a legend simply because there was no </p>
              <p>record on her in the Ming dynastic history may not be totally correct. The Malay and </p>
              <p>Indonesian historiographies are fairly similar to the Chinese historiography as literature </p>
              <p>and history is inseparable.  Literature, biography, even mythology are in complete </p>
              <p>harmony with historical facts.  Moreover, Hang Li Poh was not a princess, why should </p>
              <p>Chinese official record this event? </p>
              <p>Cheng Ho’s historic seven voyages to the Western Ocean in the 15th century </p>
              <p>opened the door for the Chinese living in the coastal provinces in China such as </p>
              <p>Guangdong and Fujian to migrate abroad. The second wave of Chinese emigration took </p>
              <p>place between 1644 to 1840s and was characterized by westernization.  The </p>
              <p>overthrow of the Ming Dynasty by the Manchus in 1644 led to an exodus of Ming </p>
              <p>royalists to Southeast Asia.  A group of these Ming royalists like Melaka’s second </p>
              <p>Chinese kapitan, Li Wei King (���) also known as Li Jun Chang <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>�or Li </p>
              <p>Kap took refuge in Melaka and later given the Kapitan post by the Dutch ruler. </p>
              <p>These cultured Ming royalists soon made fortunes from trade and were </p>
              <p>picked by the Portuguese, Dutch and British colonial governments as community 5 </p>
              <p>leaders and appointed them as Kapitans in charge of Chinese affairs from the 17th</p>
              <p> to 19th centuries. The office of the Chinese kapitan was located in the Cheng Hoon Teng </p>
              <p>Temple, the oldest Chinese temple in Melaka and Malaysia. Hence, Cheng Hoon Teng </p>
              <p>was the most important power base of the Chinese in Melaka. Cheng Hoon Teng Temple </p>
              <p>was jointly established by the first two Chinese Kapitans, Tay Hong Yoe (</p>
              <p>��) also </p>
              <p>known as Tay Kap and Li Wei King in 1673 . Then, the Chinese population in Melaka </p>
              <p>was small about 100 plus; there were 160 Chinese in 1675, two years after the foundation </p>
              <p>of the Cheng Hoon Teng Temple. In 1678, the Chinese population increased significantly </p>
              <p>to 426. Since they were entrusted to be in charge of the Chinese affairs, they took the first </p>
              <p>step to organize the Chinese community by forming the Cheng Hoon Teng Temple. </p>
              <p>Li Kap, a native of Xiamen, was one of the Ming royalists who fled from  </p>
              <p>Manchu rule after the overthrow of the Ming Dynasty in 1644.  Together with other likeminded Ming royalists, he took refuge in Malacca. These Ming royalists being learned </p>
              <p>Confucian scholars, brought Chinese culture to Malacca. Li Kap went into business and </p>
              <p>made his fortunes. He then collaborated with Tay Kap to establish the Cheng Hoon Teng </p>
              <p>Temple. Later, he bought and donated a piece of land for use by the Chinese community </p>
              <p>in Malacca as a burial ground in Bukit China or Sam Po Hill. It is not surprising that Tay </p>
              <p>Kap and Li Kap had targeted temple and burial ground as urgent services for the Chinese </p>
              <p>in Malacca. For immigrants the temple is constantly the first refuge to seek salvation of </p>
              <p>inner peace and spiritual attachment to and link up with fellow clansmen in a foreign </p>
              <p>land, and the cemetery is to ensure the wanderers a last resting place.  In any early </p>
              <p>Chinese settlement abroad, temple, clan associations and burial ground are always the 6 </p>
              <p>first forms of social organizations as they bond the immigrant community into a cohesive </p>
              <p>society.    </p>
              <p> In 1698  a French business delegation on its way to China made a brief stopover </p>
              <p>in Melaka and visited Cheng Hoon Teng. One of delegation members , Froncois Froger </p>
              <p>paid a visit to the Cheng Hoon Teng and he wrote about the temple with a temple layout </p>
              <p>plan. He described that the temple consisted of four major sections, namely the main hall, </p>
              <p>front hall, inner hall and women’s prayer quarter. On the day of his visit, the temple </p>
              <p>priests were performing religious ritual. He was so engrossed that he stayed in the temple </p>
              <p>for two hours and jotted down his impressions of the happening. Froger made one </p>
              <p>important  remark of very historical significance.  He  called the Cheng Hoon Teng </p>
              <p>Temple as “The Pagoda of the Chinese Refugees in Melaka”. It testified the existence </p>
              <p>of a considerable group of Ming royalists taking refuge in Melaka after the Manchus </p>
              <p>overthrew the Ming Dynasty in 1644. After half a century, this “refugee” impression of </p>
              <p>Melaka was still distinctively noticeable.  </p>
              <p>These refugees or Ming royalists were the pioneers of Melaka Chinese society. </p>
              <p>They brought Chinese culture to Melaka shaping the development of the Chinese society </p>
              <p>in Melaka and eventually nurtured the birth of a Peranakan Chinese culture showing the </p>
              <p>fusion of the cultural traits of both Chinese, English and Malay cultures.   </p>
              <p>The kapitan system was a legacy of the Portugese, Dutch and British colonial </p>
              <p>governments from the 16th to early 19 th centuries. The kapitans were acknowledged as the </p>
              <p>Chinese leaders by virtue of their enormous wealth and high social status. Their </p>
              <p>descendants attended Portuguese, Dutch and English schools. Many of them worked 7 </p>
              <p>in foreign firms while others started their own companies engaging in imports and </p>
              <p>exports of spices and China trade. They were the forefathers of the westernized </p>
              <p>prosperous Peranakans.  For instance, Kapitan Chua Soo Chong in the 18</p>
              <p>th century was  the father of prominent Baba Chua Chong Long and the grandfather of Baba Chua Yan Ling. </p>
              <p> The British abolished the Kapitan system in 1825. Thereafter Cheng Hoon Teng </p>
              <p>Temple introduced an appointment of temple president to be the leader of the Chinese </p>
              <p>community in Melaka in place of kapitan. The temple presidential system was later </p>
              <p>abolished in 1915. From 1825 to 1915, there were a total of six temple presidents: Liang </p>
              <p>Mei Ji, Si Hoo Keh, Tan Kim Seng, Tan Beng Swee, Tan Beng Jiak and Tan Jiak Wai. Si </p>
              <p>Hoo Keh, Tan Kim Seng, Tan Beng Swee and Tan Beng Jiak and so on were prominent </p>
              <p>Babas and dominant Chinese leaders in Singapore and Melaka. It shows that the </p>
              <p>Peranakans were the backbone of the Chinese in Singapore and Melaka in the 19</p>
              <p>th century and the first part of the 20 th century.  </p>
              <p>In the 18th and 19th centuries the Babas were involved in opium, sireh, nutmeg, </p>
              <p>pepper and gambier cultivation, tin mining, commodity trading and property. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">In the early </span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">20th century, many Babas invested in rubber. Baba  and Nyonya were financially better </span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">off than China-born Chinese. Their family wealth and connections with the Malay</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">royalties and the British and Dutch colonialists enabled them to form a Straits-Chinese </span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">elite, whose loyalty was strictly to Britain or the Netherlands.  Most Peranakans were </span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">English or Dutch-educated, as a result of the Western colonization of Malaya and </span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Indonesia, Peranakans readily embraced English and Dutch culture and education as a 8 </span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">means to advance economically. Thus administrative and civil service posts were often </span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">filled by prominent Straits Chinese. Many in the community  also worked as compradores </span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">(Chinese middlemen) for big Western companies and banks. The Peranakan community </span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">thereby became very influential in Malaya, Singapore and Indonesia and were known </span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">also as the King's Chinese due to their loyalty to the British Crown.  </span></span></strong></p>
              <p>The third wave of Chinese migration to Southeast Asia in the 19</p>
              <p>th century </p>
              <p>coincided with political turmoils in China and economic exploitation of Southeast </p>
              <p>Asia by the Dutch and British colonial powers. The Taiping Rebellion in China was a </p>
              <p>widespread civil war in southern China from 1850 to 1864. The First Opium War from </p>
              <p>1839 to 1842 and the Second Opium War from 1856 to 1860 between China under the </p>
              <p>Qing Dynasty and the British Empire. These events caused great hardships and economic </p>
              <p>dislodgements to the farmers in Fujian and Guangdong.  In the meantime, the Dutch and </p>
              <p>British colonial governments were earnestly engaged in developing labour-intensive </p>
              <p>sugar and tin-mining industries in Dutch Indies (present Indonesia) and British Malaya in </p>
              <p>the Malay Peninsula. As a consequence, the job opportunities in Indonesia and Malaya </p>
              <p>led to the mass exodus of the dislodged farmers in Fujian and Guangdong to the region. </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">These new arrivals, mostly illiterate, worked as cheap labourers in plantations and tinmines. As a result of the massive influx of the Chinese immigrants, the China-born </span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Chinese outnumbered Peranakan Chinese.</span></span></strong> The demographic change coupled with </p>
              <p>the rise of a good number of adventurous new rich who made their fortunes from</p>
              <p>tin-mines, gambier and rubber plantations as well as trade, ushered in a new phase </p>
              <p>in the history of Chinese Diaspora.  <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The rising China-born Chinese merchants 9 </span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">overtook Peranakans as community leaders.</span></span></strong> They  actively built temples, clan </p>
              <p>associations and Chinese schools to educate the immigrants’ children. As a result, it </p>
              <p>signified a phase of  re-sinicization as a dominant feature of this third wave of </p>
              <p>Chinese migration and Chinese-educated Chinese became the mainstream of the </p>
              <p>Chinese communities. </p>
              <p>This re-sinicization process remained predominant during the fourth wave of </p>
              <p>Chinese migration which was triggered by the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War  </p>
              <p>in 1937.   Soon after the war, a great number of Chinese literates and intelligentsia </p>
              <p>such as teachers, journalists and so on migrated to Southeast Asia and they </p>
              <p>reinforced dissemination of Chinese culture in overseas Chinese communities.    </p>
              <p>The post-war political developments in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore </p>
              <p>had great impact on the history of Chinese Diaspora. The end of the Pacific War in</p>
              <p>1945 saw a rise of multi-racial nationalist movements in Southeast Asia and people</p>
              <p>of all ethnic groups of former colonies were united to fight for independence. </p>
              <p>Changing Chinese communities entered a phase of commitment to national identity </p>
              <p>after World War Two.   We saw two noticeable features in this process. Firstly, the </p>
              <p>rise of a local pan-Chinese identity signified the decline of the Chinese dialect or </p>
              <p>sub-ethnic groups including the Peranakan Chinese when the Chinese joined hands </p>
              <p>with the Malays and Indians in the struggle for independence. Secondly, after </p>
              <p>independence, the Chinese moved to adopt citizenship and develop a sense of  </p>
              <p>national identity and actively engaged in nation-building.  10 </p>
              <p>Now we come back to review how these postwar changes had affected the </p>
              <p>Peranakan community. As a community that always considered Malaya home, many </p>
              <p>Peranakans were involved in civic projects and local government. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Due to their strict </span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">loyalty, they did not support Malaysian Independence. </span></span></strong>Things started to change in the </p>
              <p>later half of the 20th century, with some leading Melakan Peranakans, for examble Tan </p>
              <p>Cheng Lock and Tan Siew Sin, starting to support Malaysian independence.  </p>
              <p>Peranakan culture has started to decline in Malaysia and Singapore after </p>
              <p>Independence. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Without  British colonial support for their perceived racial neutrality, they </span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">have been faced with a cultural identity crisis. </span></span></strong>The Japanese Occupation and the </p>
              <p>Government policies in both countries following Independence from the British have </p>
              <p>resulted in the assimilation of Peranakans back into mainstream Chinese culture. </p>
              <p>Singapore classifies the Peranakans as ethnically Chinese, so they receive formal </p>
              <p>instruction in Mandarin Chinese as a second language  instead of Malay. In Malaysia, the </p>
              <p>standardization of Malay as Bahasa Melayu (required for all ethnic groups) has led to a </p>
              <p>disappearance of the unique characteristics of Baba Malay. The Peranakan culture is </p>
              <p>losing popularity to modern Western culture, but to some degree,  Peranakans try to </p>
              <p>retain their language, cuisines and customs. Young Peranakans still speak their creole </p>
              <p>language, although many young women do not wear the kebaya. Marriages normally </p>
              <p>follow the western culture because the traditional Peranakan customs are losing </p>
              <p>popularity.  </p>
              <p>The situation has been aggravated in the present age of globalization in which we </p>
              <p>see the fifth and last wave of Chinese emigration into Southeast Asia in the last 30 years 11 </p>
              <p>since the Chinese government relaxed the policy on overseas emigration. The rapid </p>
              <p>economic integration and the improved political relations between ASEAN and China </p>
              <p>resulted in new Chinese migration to Southeast Asia being possible and acceptable. </p>
              <p>Following the rise of China as a world’s powerful political and economic nation, China’s </p>
              <p>export, Chinese investment and contracted project constructions in Southeast Asia, have </p>
              <p>risen dramatically with massive new Chinese immigrants coming into Southeast Asia.  </p>
              <p>This new wave of Chinese migrants to Southeast Asia and beyond  is </p>
              <p>unprecedented in Chinese history not only because the migrants originate from northern </p>
              <p>and central Chinese provinces, but also because travel has become easier due to better </p>
              <p>transportation links both inside and outside of China. That is results in potentially larger </p>
              <p>numbers than previous waves of Chinese migration throughout the globe. These new </p>
              <p>immigrants are a breed apart from their forebears, who spoke regional dialects and </p>
              <p>exhibited little nationalism, identifying more with the localities in China from which they </p>
              <p>hailed. The recent arrivals are not only better educated, speak Mandarin, but also tend to </p>
              <p>identify with China as a whole. They are patriotic and loyal to the motherland. They are </p>
              <p>currently rising up as an important force within overseas Chinese and ethnic Chinese </p>
              <p>communities. However, the new immigrants have to move along with time to develop a </p>
              <p>sense of national identity and integrate into the mainstream local Chinese society.  </p>
              <p>The Peranakans were therefore squeezed on the one hand by the governments’ </p>
              <p>nation-building policies, and on the other hand by the influx of the Chinese new </p>
              <p>immigrants. Despite the national overtone of  nation-building policies, it consciously </p>
              <p>draws Peranakans into the mainstream Chinese society politically and culturally. The </p>
              <p>Chinese immigrant phenomenon also puts pressure on the Peranakans to be re-sinicized. 12 </p>
              <p>Hence, in the 21st century, the Peranakans face the same dilemmas and problems </p>
              <p>as other Chinese communities in Singapore and Malaysia: the decline of traditions, the </p>
              <p>inability to speak the dialect, the growing number of mixed marriages. All these factors </p>
              <p>lead to the great changes in the culture and uncertainty about the future. The frenzied </p>
              <p>activities revolving around Peranakan life and language in this decade could perhaps be </p>
              <p>seen as the frantic last throes of a declining community. But the Peranakan community </p>
              <p>seems determined to re-assert its identity in the face of encroaching modernity and loss of </p>
              <p>traditional culture and within the context of language shift and re-acculturation. </p>
              <p>In short, the Peranakan community was born during the Cheng Ho and western </p>
              <p>colonial eras. Their main characteristic was at first being localized (indigenized-Malay or </p>
              <p>Indonesian) ; westernized during colonial era, and re-sinicized at the present national </p>
              <p>stage.   </p>
              <p>Thank you.    </p>

              The Penang nonyas and babas are different from the melaka baba nonyas.
