            <div class='col-md body'>I have seen lots of cases where my bunkmates' gfs dumped them during NS period. Is it becos the girls felt left out as their bfs aint with them so much anymore? Or is it that they r just plain unfaithful ? Is it the guy's fault or the girls? Wats ya view ?<br>Beware chief! U r going to NS soon. Keep an eye on ya gf ;-)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>IMHO, i thk the gers just cant stand the lack of interaction. firstly, you cant even talk tt much and which guy wld want to whisper sweet nothings into the fone when your whole platoon's in line behind you? also, you guys wld be let out, what? every sat at most? for a girl, she hasnt seen you in soooo long, so she'll expect you to meet up with her on your precious day off. but, you wld want to be with your frens too wldnt you? sooo... sigh. problems set in.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>And besides what ataraxia listed, another reason may be the girls' change in environment. Especially for girls who are in Uni while their bfs are at ns. They would get to know many other guys, who may possibly share their interests &amp; most importantly, can spend lots more time with them. Loneliness wrecks relationships many a time.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Er.. I'll probably get bombarded for this, but sad to say I am actually guilty of that crime. Yeah, I broke up with my bf when he's in NS and me in uni.<br>The reason? The guys in uni seems so mature (though I soon realise its juz an illusion), my bf has no time for me... blah blah blah.<br>I can go on listing, but ultimately, think of this, how many 18/19 yr olds manage to stay together as a couple? NS or not?<br>I know it hurts, but its beta than living a lie.<br>Btw, I am still frens with my ex bf, that's a consolation, I guess.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guess this shouldn't concern guys like me who dun have a gf when I went into NS  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> The perks of not having a gf while in army?<br><br>No.1 :No need to fight for the phone after a tough day of training and sweating.<br><br>No 2: Can bathe, sleep and rest early.<br><br>No. 3: No need to be scared of my gf running away with another guy while I'm in bunk feeling helpless.<br><br>No. 4 : Can spend my whole weekend relaxing esp. after a tough field camp or excercise feeding mosquitoes with our blood.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Not meaning to show sacar here though. Just that you girls should know how much your bfs are going through for you while they are in camp! And ultimately, they get dumped, sad  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>But of course lucky guys(???) like me don't have to go thru all this.Just another case of a lonely single male making himself feel better  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Why?

            <div class='col-md body'>it's really hard maintaining a r'ship like that. i think the most important thing is trust and not to be haunted by the thought of 'my girlfriend might break up with me'. paranoia isn't good for health. really.<br>i s'pose it's up to the girl's good sense not to do anything stupid. maybe a couple is not meant to be together if something goes awry.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>But there are also many cases of couples still together. I heard from my BMT bunkmates that his brother and sister-in-law got married after begin together for 10 years, since their secondary times!<br><br>Of coz there is a high tendency due to many other reasons. What is it, we all know so I dun have type them out. They have to overcome it one by one and then the relationship will last longer. It is not easy but it is good.<br><br>------------------<br>why, bishamon? why bish?<br>coz he's God of War!!<br>But I'm a peacelover! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
