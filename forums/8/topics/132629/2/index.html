            <div class='col-md body'>Quoted from Sunday Mail:-<br><br>MISS PERFECT<br>Surgery a 'success'<br>By MARY PAPADAKIS in Melbourne<br>22may05<br><br>KYLIE MINOGUE was charming hospital staff just hours after she underwent a successful operation to remove a lump from her breast.<br><br>And the diminutive Australian superstar was praised by her surgeon for being the "perfect patient".<br><br>Dr Jenny Senior, a top breast cancer surgeon, said Kylie should make a full recovery.<br><br>"I feel confident we caught the cancer in time; that she's now on the road to complete recovery," Dr Senior said yesterday.<br><br>"Kylie has been the perfect patient and has charmed all my staff. I wish I could have met her under happier circumstances."<br><br>She said Kylie, 36, was resting after the operation and her spirits were high. The singer was admitted to Melbourne's Cabrini Hospital on Friday afternoon.<br><br>"At 5pm I performed an operation for an early breast cancer," Dr Senior said.<br><br>"The operation is considered the best practice around the world for a girl with an early breast cancer. I am very pleased to be able to confirm the operation was successful."<br><br>Hospital staff said Kylie had already undergone her first session of radiotherapy.<br><br>Dr Senior also passed on a message from the singer to her millions of fans.<br><br>"Kylie has asked me to pass on her thanks once again to all who have expressed their love and concern for her," she said.<br><br>"Your support has certainly helped her through a tough time."<br><br>Kylie was being comforted yesterday by boyfriend Olivier Martinez, her sister Dannii, who flew in from London to be by her side on Friday, her cameraman brother Brendan and parents Ron and Carol.<br><br>It is believed she may have left the hospital in the afternoon. A silver Audi was seen speeding into the family's home in the Melbourne inner-eastern suburb of Canterbury.<br><br>"She's feeling fine," Dr Senior said. "She has her family and friends around her."<br><br>She praised Kylie and Martinez, who stayed by her bedside throughout her ordeal.<br><br>"I would like to thank Kylie, her family, and Olivier for making my job very easy; they were so welcoming," she said.<br><br>Martinez looked exhausted and emotionally drained as he drove out of the Cabrini Hospital car park in a black Nissan sedan at 11.45am yesterday.<br><br>It is understood the Hollywood star and Kylie spent the night comforting each other in a private room in the operating theatre. Martinez has hardly left Kylie's side since he urged her to seek help after she fell ill on a flight to Melbourne two weeks ago and later discovered a lump in her breast.<br><br>"This is our fight," he reportedly told his superstar girlfriend.<br><br>"I'm not going anywhere. I'm here for you now and nothing else matters. Just get well."<br><br>Delta Goodrem yesterday posted a message of hope for Kylie on her website, wishing her a speedy recovery.<br><br>"My thoughts and love go out to Kylie and her family at this most sensitive and personal time," she said.<br><br>"I wish her much strength and support for a speedy recovery.<br><br>"Kylie is someone I admire greatly and it's wonderful that so many of you are expressing such kindness and support to Kylie and her fans during this time."<br><br>Hollywood-based actor Naomi Watts also sent Kylie a message of support from New York: "I am thinking of you and sending you lots of love and strength, Naomi X."<br><br>Martinez's father Robert told Britain's Daily Mirror newspaper his son was "devastated but he knows the only important thing is to see her well".<br><br>Close friend Nicole Bonython-Hines said she was confident the petite star would make a full recovery following the surgery.<br><br>"I've sent my love to her through her family," she said.<br><br>"She's obviously got to it early, which is the best thing, and I'm confident she will pull through.<br><br>"She's a fit, healthy, positive person so all those things together will hopefully speed her recovery."<br><br></div>
