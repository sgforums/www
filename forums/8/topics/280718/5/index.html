In the end, they are the same as me, the only different between they and me, is their brain capacity can't able to type out more than 10 line, to try and attempt to gun me down.<br><br>So for the love of god, a nice guy will never attempt to even engage in a flame war, he would back off, it is their stupidity that causes them and why i drive them to a corner, reason being, simple, because i can, and i will, just to tell them, there are many sort of people in this world, will be harsh with words, and their ego can be bruised that easily, but as if they will care, so lets cut the crap about, letting others have a backdoor, the society is even more cruel than that, backstabbers happens everywhere, we wear a smile everyday, and i smile at others and i am capable of, stabbing them right in the back, if they pissed me off, and they probably not going to know for a while who stabbed their back, and i still can smile, that is who i am, and what i am,<br><br>i can be civil on one hand, on the other, i can be as crude as i can be, because  nice guy don't finish first, good guys does finish first, but i survive the longest in this society, a roleplaying skill that i learned when i was young, how i survive the whole NS, without doing any duty at all, how to say the right words at the right time, and i am sick and tired of being a nice guy, because it isn't rewarding, so guess what, why should i care for those dick, they engage in a flame war, and the outcome is deserving.<br><br>All they have to do is very simple, don't engage in a flame war, unless you are capable of, bringing out the worst out of you, and know how to be calm, otherwise you end up like a dickhead, peebrain, who just had a surgery and officially become a mentally challenged person.<br><br>I know when i should back off, there are times, i should be the graceful person to apologise, because years of being in the hospitality service, teaches me, how to be a god damn hypocrite in front of people and smile at them, even though you hated that person so much. So before you even have an attempt to label me, as a ignorant, naive, arrogant, self center person, you should really think twice. Words can be either motivating or destructive, and when i am serious, i choose my words carefully, and when i flame, i am tactless, because i don't have to care about how that guy feels, as a result, they become a p u s s y,<br><br>Caring is never being a priority, it is about, protecting yourself from being push around, just because that guy is only capable of one line, and i serious suggest, that either he spend more time, reading the newspaper, to brush up on his darn general knowledge, otherwise, he is inadequate, simply naive, those dick never make any sense in their sentence, and funny, sometimes, i wonder why i want to spend time, even think of what i am going to say in order to efficiently flame, as their brain cells, will be unable to process half of what i type, what they only emphasis is those strong words, that i use, which is moron, and that trigger their emotion, which i lead them into, a moron i may call them, but nope, it is an act of impulse, that lead me, nonsense, the inability to think of the right words, to rebuke my sentence back, which is what i like to call, with a smirk on my face, and see that you are nothing but a raging hormones teenage who just to argue for the sake, and protect that little pride of yours, and which you don't know that, once you are in a flame war, you are as low as you could be, and you are already damaging your own darn reputation, as if there is any to speak of.<br><br>So what am i? i am someone who knows how to respect others, and give the same courtesy to others as what they have shown me, i may be a prick but i am not a immature person who doesn't know how to differentiate between friends and dick<br><br>So can you comprehend anything, that i have typed out so far, or should i shorten this so that you can absorb it.          </div></blockquote>u can talk a lot</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by allentyb:</div><div class="quote_body">oh i do, but most of the time, it end up in a flame war, i back them a corner and should i be more civil, and offer them a handshake after a flame, and admit that i may have been tactless, but the truth is, when they choose to engage in a flame war, i insulted them, and they insulted me back, i have no complain about that at all, nor i have gone and cry in a corner, or i feel that i am guilty of it.<br><br>the fact is, if they does consider what a flame war, can deal to their protective little pride inside them, they will not even have bother to feed into my flame bait, or engage in a flame war, and flame is a very ugly thing, like it or not, they did what i do, hide behind a screen, and choose to type whatever comes to my mind, they are as what i am, at least i am being frank about it, but they try to be pretentious nice people. In the end, they are the same as me, the only different between they and me, is their brain capacity can't able to type out more than 10 line, to try and attempt to gun me down.<br><br>So for the love of god, a nice guy will never attempt to even engage in a flame war, he would back off, it is their stupidity that causes them and why i drive them to a corner, reason being, simple, because i can, and i will, just to tell them, there are many sort of people in this world, will be harsh with words, and their ego can be bruised that easily, but as if they will care, so lets cut the crap about, letting others have a backdoor, the society is even more cruel than that, backstabbers happens everywhere, we wear a smile everyday, and i smile at others and i am capable of, stabbing them right in the back, if they pissed me off, and they probably not going to know for a while who stabbed their back, and i still can smile, that is who i am, and what i am,<br><br>i can be civil on one hand, on the other, i can be as crude as i can be, because  nice guy don't finish first, good guys does finish first, but i survive the longest in this society, a roleplaying skill that i learned when i was young, how i survive the whole NS, without doing any duty at all, how to say the right words at the right time, and i am sick and tired of being a nice guy, because it isn't rewarding, so guess what, why should i care for those dick, they engage in a flame war, and the outcome is deserving.<br><br>All they have to do is very simple, don't engage in a flame war, unless you are capable of, bringing out the worst out of you, and know how to be calm, otherwise you end up like a dickhead, peebrain, who just had a surgery and officially become a mentally challenged person.<br><br>I know when i should back off, there are times, i should be the graceful person to apologise, because years of being in the hospitality service, teaches me, how to be a god damn hypocrite in front of people and smile at them, even though you hated that person so much. So before you even have an attempt to label me, as a ignorant, naive, arrogant, self center person, you should really think twice. Words can be either motivating or destructive, and when i am serious, i choose my words carefully, and when i flame, i am tactless, because i don't have to care about how that guy feels, as a result, they become a p u s s y,<br><br>Caring is never being a priority, it is about, protecting yourself from being push around, just because that guy is only capable of one line, and i serious suggest, that either he spend more time, reading the newspaper, to brush up on his darn general knowledge, otherwise, he is inadequate, simply naive, those dick never make any sense in their sentence, and funny, sometimes, i wonder why i want to spend time, even think of what i am going to say in order to efficiently flame, as their brain cells, will be unable to process half of what i type, what they only emphasis is those strong words, that i use, which is moron, and that trigger their emotion, which i lead them into, a moron i may call them, but nope, it is an act of impulse, that lead me, nonsense, the inability to think of the right words, to rebuke my sentence back, which is what i like to call, with a smirk on my face, and see that you are nothing but a raging hormones teenage who just to argue for the sake, and protect that little pride of yours, and which you don't know that, once you are in a flame war, you are as low as you could be, and you are already damaging your own darn reputation, as if there is any to speak of.<br><br>So what am i? i am someone who knows how to respect others, and give the same courtesy to others as what they have shown me, i may be a prick but i am not a immature person who doesn't know how to differentiate between friends and dick<br><br>So can you comprehend anything, that i have typed out so far, or should i shorten this so that you can absorb it.          </div></blockquote>Since u explain in such detail and in your own words , then dont blame people if they think less of you for being who you are and what you are. At least you know the nice guys dont finish last concept. Its not about nice or not , its about u having the balls to do what u gotta do regardless of anybody else when it comes to getting what u want. And the 'nice' guys will just lose the opportunity because they ponder too much too long.<br><br>I am harsh also.. especially towards people that antagonise themselves over things that will happen and does not go by the book. It depends where u use those harsh words. Before a flame war even starts i wouldve fanned out the flames already. Its not about being nice giving them a backdoor. Its a diplomatic way showing respect and courtesy to solve problems. It will work in all environments , all discussions and problems. Its because someone didnt give room to back away and take a breath that leads to ppl bleeding in the gutter , chopped up and lying dying in his own pool of blood.<br><br>Maybe this is the forum and you may feel that it has no consequence and can be reckless , i mean thats up to you. Its your choice of words that makes people respond furiously back at you.<br><br>Anyways , dont worry , i have the ability to comprehend what you just typed out. U dont have to shorten it so my own brain can absorb your explanation of your character. U just pretty much explained what kind of person you are and well frankly , allows me to really know how low you can go, hell i will go low...like the snake hugging the ground too. But the difference between you and me is just basically how diplomatic one is and whether or not one will act recklessly or not.<br><br>well.. this is ur apology thread so i am not here busting anyone's balls.</div>
