In the end, they are the same as me, the only different between they and me, is their brain capacity can't able to type out more than 10 line, to try and attempt to gun me down.<br><br>So for the love of god, a nice guy will never attempt to even engage in a flame war, he would back off, it is their stupidity that causes them and why i drive them to a corner, reason being, simple, because i can, and i will, just to tell them, there are many sort of people in this world, will be harsh with words, and their ego can be bruised that easily, but as if they will care, so lets cut the crap about, letting others have a backdoor, the society is even more cruel than that, backstabbers happens everywhere, we wear a smile everyday, and i smile at others and i am capable of, stabbing them right in the back, if they pissed me off, and they probably not going to know for a while who stabbed their back, and i still can smile, that is who i am, and what i am,<br><br>i can be civil on one hand, on the other, i can be as crude as i can be, because  nice guy don't finish first, good guys does finish first, but i survive the longest in this society, a roleplaying skill that i learned when i was young, how i survive the whole NS, without doing any duty at all, how to say the right words at the right time, and i am sick and tired of being a nice guy, because it isn't rewarding, so guess what, why should i care for those dick, they engage in a flame war, and the outcome is deserving.<br><br>All they have to do is very simple, don't engage in a flame war, unless you are capable of, bringing out the worst out of you, and know how to be calm, otherwise you end up like a dickhead, peebrain, who just had a surgery and officially become a mentally challenged person.<br><br>I know when i should back off, there are times, i should be the graceful person to apologise, because years of being in the hospitality service, teaches me, how to be a god damn hypocrite in front of people and smile at them, even though you hated that person so much. So before you even have an attempt to label me, as a ignorant, naive, arrogant, self center person, you should really think twice. Words can be either motivating or destructive, and when i am serious, i choose my words carefully, and when i flame, i am tactless, because i don't have to care about how that guy feels, as a result, they become a p u s s y,<br><br>Caring is never being a priority, it is about, protecting yourself from being push around, just because that guy is only capable of one line, and i serious suggest, that either he spend more time, reading the newspaper, to brush up on his darn general knowledge, otherwise, he is inadequate, simply naive, those dick never make any sense in their sentence, and funny, sometimes, i wonder why i want to spend time, even think of what i am going to say in order to efficiently flame, as their brain cells, will be unable to process half of what i type, what they only emphasis is those strong words, that i use, which is moron, and that trigger their emotion, which i lead them into, a moron i may call them, but nope, it is an act of impulse, that lead me, nonsense, the inability to think of the right words, to rebuke my sentence back, which is what i like to call, with a smirk on my face, and see that you are nothing but a raging hormones teenage who just to argue for the sake, and protect that little pride of yours, and which you don't know that, once you are in a flame war, you are as low as you could be, and you are already damaging your own darn reputation, as if there is any to speak of.<br><br>So what am i? i am someone who knows how to respect others, and give the same courtesy to others as what they have shown me, i may be a prick but i am not a immature person who doesn't know how to differentiate between friends and dick<br><br>So can you comprehend anything, that i have typed out so far, or should i shorten this so that you can absorb it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Zarks, before you even think of, knowing what i did before, and think that, you know what i have done before, you should reconsider before quoting somebody comment, because as of, right now, i can be either very defensive which could lead to a debate on how much you think you know about me, or the type of words, i can use upon you, don't worry, i will not flame you, as someone asked me, to be more tactful to people who doesn't know me at all, in order to prevent any other misunderstanding, but i don't care. you will just be another of FI list of complainants.<br><br>Unless you have the confident to be able to backup your sentence, otherwise i suggest you do some read up, those people who post before you, at least, joined earlier than you do. So at least they read about what i did before, and i respect their views, but you on the other hand, who the heck are you, to even +1 on a post, and i don't know you at all, if you think that i lack of the sense of humor, my reply to you is, ok so? do you think i am cracking a joke, i am not, i am being crude, and as for the maturity part, i shalt not deny that, on several occasions, i can be immature, but life is just too darn short to be serious<br><br>and before, i spam you with a wall of text, take this time, to read what i read before. Don't underestimate what i will do</div>
