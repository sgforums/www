And since day one, i joined this forum, i flamed numerous people, that is how i achieve this post count,<br><br>and i strongly feel that, nobody should be a racist, condemn others of, their religious, and that dick who created the thread, should have told everyone, he could make money out of it, in the first place, and it is his mistake of not creating a proper link, and comes up with excuses of prying in others curiosity, is lame, so for the last and final time, this thread has nothing to do with that snake thread</div>
