In front of us, there were two ladies. We thought that they were either indonesians or philipinos.<br><br>One young officer was stationed at the gate. He instructed one to go for baggage scan while another one can go directly to immigration counter. These two ladies either didn't understand or just wondered why both of them had to split up.
