            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone,<br><br>Are you content with what you have now and where you are going? I'm not just asking about the snap shot of how you feel now, rather your feelings on the stage you are at now in life.<br><br>Are you happy with who you are? Or do you think that there are so many improvements to be made that you might as well start from scratch?<br><br>Are you optimistic about your progress in your career, whether you are studying/ working, so that you know that your future is bright and cheerful? Or do you hate your job so much that you rather eat shredded glass then go and face the shit conditions in your workplace?<br><br>Are you happy with who you have, as friends and companions? Or do you burst out in tears whenever you think of the one person you think you should have made taken the initiative to speak to at that bbq?<br><br>One of my friends was remarking to me during a tute that he is damn jealous of a certain guy in that flashy car who is rubbing shoulders with some big shot businessmen, at the ripe old age of 24, while we are stuck in a stuffy room at 3 oclock on a beautiful day learning about what will happen to our bladders when we hit 60.<br><br>Which got me thinking about how little I have achieved in my past 20++ years of life. Almost long enough to experience a mid life crisis. So, I would like to hear from anyone, whether they feel the same way, and the reasons why.<br><br>Come on, this is not in any way just thread for complaining. Say what you want, write what you think, and pray that we all will work to remedy/ improve things.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi! Great topic!! Kind of pondering over the past, present &amp; the future.<br><br>Contented &amp; happy: Yes, in a way, with what i had done, archived etc. Dun wanna make comparission, just want to be happy with whatever i'm given. I know there's always the what if, should have done this or that &amp; so on. There's always a "but", it will never end. Just want to live my life w/o too much restrictions due to external pressures, age, social etc..of coz still sticking to a certain principles of urs.<br>Envy, greed, hitting goals at the expense of others etc is not my style. But at the same time, just stay optimistic about what is to come, good or bad, i dun go against it, just overcome it.......how bout u? Still searching?<br><br>Ps: the list is just to long, too lazy to type. It's easier to talk than to write...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ah..nice thread for some self reflection   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>To be honest, yes, I'll say I am happy, or at least I think I am. Though I must admit life has not gone my way all the time, but I overall, I can't say I do not wake up every morning looking forward to a brand new day.<br><br>In terms of accomplishment I feel I have done little too. But is that a valid reason for me to be unhappy about? I mean I accept the fact that not many of us here can achieve something big in our short lifespan. Sure, I would like to have the opportunity to do something on a scale that would send ripples through the world; something that would earn me recognition and respect in the annuals of mankind's history. But I am realistic; such opportunity may or may not knock during my lifetime. I still interact with the world, doing a small part that may one day fit into the big picture - or become the big picture itself. But till that time comes, life still goes on...<br><br>I do have regrets in life and such, but will regretting over a past issue change the way you are today? I think not. What's important is that one should be able to learn from that event, so that you would be wiser when making a decision in the face of a similiar one. I try not to regret, as its not very constructive use of time.<br><br>Well, it is tempting to go on rambling about this and that, but I doubt many would be interested to read it anway   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Mabe its just me, but I feel that being happy or sad with your current state of life, time still ticks; events still transpire; everything still moves.<br><br>It may be an attempted self-delusion on my part, but it has served me well. At least I can see optimisim in everything I do. Hence I am able to look forward to the challenges each new day brings, with a radiance that matches the life-giving sun at the dawn of day   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>I do not embrace my dark side, but I do acknowledge it;<br>else I can never be whole<br><br>[This message has been edited by Bravehart (edited 23 February 2000).]</div>

So many things I could have done with the time i had in my hands....<br><br>But i wouldn't go to say that I am unhappy with what I have now. I have a happy family environment, a bunch of good friends and these are enough to make me feel satisfied already. Perhaps I would go to say that in a certain area of my life(family, friends) I am very happy with what I have.<br><br>Other areas, mainly, my career, education and lovelife are perhaps areas that I am deeply unsatisfied with.<br><br>So would that make me an unhappy customer of my life?
