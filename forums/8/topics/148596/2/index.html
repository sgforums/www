            <div class='col-md body'>Who created God? Something must have been created out of something else. But if God had come from something else, then that something else must also have come from something. At some point, something must have come from nothing. But was that possible? Wasn't that just as impossible as the idea that the world had always existed?<br><br>We had learned at school that God created the world. I could accept that God created space, but what about God himself? Had he created himself out of nothing? Even though God could create all kinds of things, he could hardly create himself before he had a 'self' to create with. So perhaps there was only one possibility left: God had always existed. How contradicting? Everything that existed had to have a beginning to start with.<br><br>How was the world created? Is there any will or meaning behind what happens? Is there a life after death? How can we answer these questions? And most important, how ought we to live? People have been asking these questions throughout the ages. We know of no culture which has concerned itself with what man is and where the world came from.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello....<br><br>This question has simple answer. Scientifically and religiously.<br><br>We have the concept of time, of beginning and end. Of place. Of matter.<br><br>Our concept of time, beginning, end, place, matter, are all very limited in scope due to our environment.<br><br>Even, we have only made small progress in this limited scope. Einstein theory only came very recently in human science.<br><br>Not forgeting, Einstein didnt finish his work. He couldn't figure out how to apply time and space for atoms and neurons and magnetic fields before he died. Nobody has succeeded until now. There is much work to be done beyond our current knowledge.<br><br>Stephen Hawking, all the other great scientists, have all struggled their whole life to contribute to the collective human knowledge, especially on space and time.<br><br>Every concept we know, is limited, because those concepts are based on, or derived from our known environment, including the concept of time and place. This concept of time and place is not known for sure to 'exist'  'beyond' the 'universe' and the whole scientific community knows that every science, especially natural science like physics, is hostage to our specific environment. The concept of time, place, beginning, end, matter, are all hostages of our specific environment and the limited scope.<br><br>If u understand this, u won't ask about 'who created God'? or 'What preceded the most beginning of universe'? etc those kinda question. Becoz.....if u go 'outside' and reach there, u can't still use the 'inside' thinking which totally doesnt apply in scientific manner.<br><br>Put it simply, it's like, u can't think of how fast an apple will drop from 10m above ground, if there is no concept of gravity. How fast sound will travel, if there is no concept of media. Similarly, u can't think 'Who created God/ what preceded universe' because this thinking uses the concept of time and place.<br><br>And not forgeting, our understanding of these 2 concepts are still incomplete too.<br><br>Let me explain, due to our specific environment, we in the past have observed gravity. We can think about how fast an apple will drop from 10m above ground. We now understand that on the moon the gravity is different and so the apple there will drop with different speed than on earth. But imagine, prior to this knowledge, everybody thinks an apple must fall with a certain speed ONLY. They could make their calculations. They had their own version of the concept of gravity. But they couldn't imagine their calculations can be wrong. Because of their limited environment and their limited concept. They couldn't imagine their concept of gravity is limited and incomplete. In their wildest dreams they couldn't think that an apple can float. Because that goes against their concept of gravity. They think what comes up must come down. They couldn't imagine humans can float, like modern austronauts in their space shuttles are doing nowadays.<br><br>When u say What created God, What preceded universe, u need to know these questions use the concept of time and place, which are still incomplete, and very limited in scope, and found in our specific environment. When u go from this environment to another, u can't take the same time and place concept with u, otherwise u still stay inside the same environment. Therefore u haven't gone to the 'preceding universe' u are truly trying to go. By wanting to go to this 'preceding universe' by using the same concept of time/ place, u are just setting up urself in wrong circles. (notice precede=use time, universe=use place) (and notice created=time, who=place). No wonder nobody can solve or answer this question, because it is scientifically and philosophically flawed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i hope to share with you my little understanding.<br>in my belief God is the creator of time and space<br>everything is the creation of God except God himself thats why he call himself the almighty the eternal the creator.<br>he is independent of any and everything.<br>he is not bound by time and space but he created it.<br>its impossible to imagine how god looks like but theres a story about this prophet.<br>once this prophet came to his companions and ask them why they are gathering at one place.the companions answer that they are prasing God for giving them guidance to the correct path so the prophet said to them more or less something like this do not think of the form of God he has a form but we are not able to imagine it but reflect about his creation.<br>today morning when you wake up just try to look at the sun when its noon.can you look directly at it?i think the answer is no we will blind our eyes if we do that.<br>and the sun is just a very very small creation of God which provide so much energy for this earth if we always reflect about the creation of God we will have more understanding about how great is his might and power.<br>God definitely is there whether we deny or accept one day from Adam to the last baby born in this world we will all see.God has asked us to wait patiently.for that day will sure come to pass.<br>btw i m a muslim convert not a good muslim though if not i will not be in this forum seeing things i should not see.<br></div>
