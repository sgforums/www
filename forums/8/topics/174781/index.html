            <div class='col-md body'>is there no such things as manners? why neighbours are always so uncouth?<br><br>my neighbour is very barbarian and very unreasonable. they park in front of my house and said that i am wrong. is there such things? and they claim i should know whos car is parking infront of my car. should i? did they write their name on the car? they said i horn is rude and the person who came to confront me why i horned at the car is even rudder!! he says why did i horn in an attidute that he is dying to slap me. if i know the car belongs to them would i horn to get attention?am i stupid? and they said that i did not know who the car belongs to means that i am stupid and brainless. personal attack... and they gladly admitted it saying that yes they are making a personal attack. why are they so unreasonable? i have rubbish outside my window and i didnt even confront them for it ( we are living in semi -detached house and he is the immediate neighbour) cause i know that even there is rubbish i cannot assume it thrown by them. so if everyone walks to their doorway and throw a piece of paper they will assume that the rubbish is thrown by us. are they as brainless as they protray themself to be?<br>they always park so long at my place and didnt even ask me if they can , and they claim that they are courteous enough. is this really the case? now who is rite and who is wrong? last time when they are not here and they have not moved here for even 6 months they are always the muslim people parking infront of our house and who will we know who the car belongs to! they showed their attitude as if they are very rich and bully us when they think they have lots of people in the house. they confronted me with at least 15 people with me alone!!<br>their friends keep talking infront of my house and talk so loudly in the middle of the night to keep my dogs barking all night and with all their maids chattering in the middle of the night 3am! keep my maid and my dogs awake all nite, never once did i confront them. they really gone too far. i should have confronted them when the need arises, now they think that we are weak and they bullied us. such bullying neighbours, and they complain that our dogs are barking, well, they have no sense of logic, of watch dogs don bark how can they be watch dogs and with the number of stangers going in and out of our area who know if they are their friends or not? everyday different groups of people and their silly children screaming in the middle of the nights banging on the walls are they really as courteous as they claim? anyway for their information we are not the only house that keeps dogs. how can they jus assume that it IS OUR dogs that keep barking? so if thats the case i hv the rite to assume the rubbish outside my window is thrown by them and if they can throw rubbish jus like this how i know they will not climb over and steal my things in my room?<br>someone comment pls</div>
