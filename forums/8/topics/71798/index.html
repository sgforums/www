            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Or maybe not. Fans of Energy are queueing for 19 days to meet their idols here. They want to break the record of the 11-day wait by 5566's fans<br><br>By Foong Woei Wan </strong><br><br>IT MAY not be apparent to passers-by at Funan The IT Mall, but 17-year-old Koh Sin Nee and her friends are on a round-the-clock Big Mission.<br><br>A 19-day mission, to be exact.<br><br>They have set up camp at a stage on the first floor of the mall to queue and be first in line to meet their idols, Taiwanese hip-hop group Energy.<br><br>The thing is, the four boys from Energy will only be in Singapore to plug their fourth album, 4ever, next Wednesday.<br><br>They will be at Funan to meet their fans only next Saturday at 7.30pm.<br><br>But since last Tuesday,Koh and a group of 50 friends have been taking turns to wait in line for the boys.<br><br>They first formed a queue at Plaza Singapura in Orchard Road, where Energy's autograph-signing session was to have taken place.<br><br>Yesterday, record label Universal Music announced that, due to an 'internal miscommunication', the session would actually be at Funan.<br><br>When the girls heard this, they rushed there to form a new queue.<br><br>'It's worth the wait because it's Energy,' says Koh, who has just finished her O levels.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">But why on earth are they wasting 19 days in the queue?</span><br><br>Put it down to obsessive Taiwanese boyband rivalry. The Energy girls want to better the record set by fans of Taiwanese boyband 5566.<br><br>Last month, more than 70 of 5566's fans waited for 11 days at Junction 8 in Bishan for a chance to be the first to meet the five singers.<br><br>All in, a record 15,000 fans turned up for autographs from the actor-singers that day.<br><br>The 5566 fans had set out to out-queue F4 fans.<br><br>Two months ago, a group of F4 fans waited for seven days to meet singer Vic Chou at Junction 8.<br><br>Universal's product manager Connie Low says: 'Kids now are more daring, more expressive. Fans of the past knew their place.'<br><br>But she adds that since the Energy girls have started queuing, 'of course we hope to hype up the event'.<br><br>She says she has asked the mall's security guards to watch over the fans.<br><br><strong>AIMING FOR PUBLICITY</strong><br><br>OVER at Funan, Koh and her friends arm themselves with CDs, magazines, newspapers and paper fans printed with Energy's logo to kill time.<br><br>The more than 50 female friends take turns to sit in the queue.<br><br>The youngest is 14, the oldest 21 and at least one of them is queueing at any one time. At night, at least two of them are around.<br><br>Wang Yiyun, an 18-year-old fan, says that one of their aims is to put their idols on the map of Mandarin-pop consciousness.<br><br>'People only know that 5566 is popular. They don't know that Energy is popular too,' she says.<br><br>Another fan, 17-year-old waitress Ryozo Lee, admits that their record-breaking queue is meant to attract the attention of the media and that of their idols.<br><br>'When we do this, you guys come here. Then, Energy will know that they are popular in Singapore. Then, they will come to Singapore more,' she says.<br><br><strong>F4 STARTED IT</strong><br><br><img src="http://www.straitstimes.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2004-03-04/life_6_0305.jpg"><br><br>COMPETITIVE queueing is a recent development in idol worship here.<br><br>It has its roots in 2001. That year, F4 became famous overnight after acting in Meteor Garden, a popular pop-idol drama series based on a Japanese comic book.<br><br>Banking on its fame, the quartet also released its debut record, Meteor Rain, which sold four million copies worldwide.<br><br>When the boys came to Singapore to meet fans at Junction 8 that year, a then-record 10,000 fans turned up.<br><br>But only about 7,000 were allowed to go onstage to shake the hands of their idols.<br><br>Before the F4 phenomenon, the turn-out for meet-and-greet sessions with stars such as Taiwan's early 1990s boyband The Little Tigers and Hong Kong's Heavenly King Jacky Cheung numbered in the hundreds, say industry insiders.<br><br>'When F4 came to town, it was as if comic-book characters had come to life. The girls went ga-ga,' says Ms Jasmine Chong, marketing manager for Music Street, which distributes the music of popsters from 5566 to Vivian Hsu.<br><br>After the F4 incident, it became common for fans to queue for days for meet-and-greet sessions and also at concerts with free-standing tickets.<br><br>Fan clubs such as Only F4 and pro-5566 Starland take queueing so seriously, they even draft queue rosters.<br><br>In fact, executive officer Stephanie Loh, 30, Only F4's vice-president, takes leave so that she can queue for a day at events.<br><br>'My maid takes care of my son,' she says blithely of her F4 stake-out duties.<br><br><img src="http://www.straitstimes.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2004-03-04/life_5_0305.jpg"><br><br>Singaporean F4 fans also queue on behalf of fellow fans who are flying in from countries such as Australia, Japan and South Korea for an event, she adds. The fans communicate via the Internet.<br><br>The rivalry among the boybands themselves has intensified their fans' ardour for queueing.<br><br>Starland's president, shipping assistant Tony Yap, 23, says he and other members fully intended to beat Vic Chou's fans when they queued for 11 days to meet 5566 last month.<br><br>And Energy fan Wang says she was inspired to queue because she wants to put the 5566 singers in their place.<br><br>Apparently, singer Zax Wang from 5566 had bragged in the Taiwanese programme Showbiz that no one else had fans who would be willing to queue for as many days.<br><br>'I want to show that what 5566 fans can do, Energy fans can do, too,' says Wang.<br><br>As to what her parents make of the Energy vs 5566 rivalry, she replies with a smile: 'My mother likes F4.'<br><br>Energy will sing and sign autographs at Funan The IT Mall next Saturday. They will stamp autographs and shake fans' hands at West Mall next Sunday.The 5566 Concert 2004 will be on at the Singapore Indoor Stadium on April 17 at 8pm.<br><br><strong>PROFILE OF A BOYBAND FAN</strong><br><img src="http://www.straitstimes.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2004-03-04/life_1_0305.jpg"><br><br>RYOZO LEE is what you would call a serial boyband supporter.<br><br>In the past three years, the 17-year-old part-time waitress has gone to sessions where Taiwanese groups, including F4, 5566, WeWe, Comic Boyz and Energy, meet fans.<br><br>Currently, Energy is her favourite band. She says this is because success has not gone to the singers' heads.<br><br>'They are popular but still modest,' she says.<br><br>She is now with a group of 50 female friends aged 14 to 21 who are taking turns to queue for 19 days.<br><br>While most people might think that they are mad, she insists that she is not a fanatical fan.<br><br>'I'm not the kind of fan to book a cab and chase them,' she says.<br><br>She and her friends have also never hounded their idols at hotels because 'we should give them space'.<br><br>In fact, she confesses that she might not be a fan of Energy forever, although she claims to be a life-long Andy Lau fan like her mother.<br><br>One thing is for sure, though. The 19-day queue for Energy will end in tears for her 'because I am so happy to see them that I always cry at their events'.<br><br></div>
