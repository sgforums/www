I don't predict that flagging down taxis will be less costly.<br><br>So who benefits?</span><br><br>OCT 1, 2003<br>Two more players in taxi industry<br><br>This makes three newcomers given licences in last two months, which will mean 7 operators and 1,200 more cabs<br><br>By Christopher Tan<br>SENIOR CORRESPONDENT<br><br>TWO more companies have been given a licence to operate taxis in the seemingly overcrowded industry here, bringing the total number of operators to seven.<br><br>Both are branches of car-rental companies. Smart Automobile is owned by an Indonesian trader who runs a taxi fleet in Batam. Premier Taxi is owned by two siblings, scions of the Chua family which founded Cycle &amp; Carriage and made its fortune selling mainly Mercedes-Benz cars.<br><br>This makes three newcomers to the industry in the past two months.<br><br>In August, bottled-gas supplier Teo Kiang Ang's Trans-Cab was the first to land a licence since 1990, which was when Tibs Taxis - now part of SMRT Corp - entered the fray.<br><br>The decision to award these latest permits is tied to a move to monitor the service quality of operators from January next year; those who fall short of specified standards risk losing them.<br><br>Both Premier Taxi and Smart Automobile plan to start next year with 50 cabs each.<br><br>The Chuas - Timothy, 37, and sister Marianne, 40 - plan to roll out Premier Taxi cabs in March from an office at Balmoral Plaza in Bukit Timah.<br><br>Mr Chua was 'not at all surprised' at getting the licence.<br><br>'We have the track record and the capital,' he said, pointing to the company's paid-up capital of $6.25 million and net asset value of $9 million.<br><br>'This is an incremental business for me,' said the man who has run the gamut in vehicle-related businesses since his family sold Cycle &amp; Carriage in the early 1990s.<br><br>'I know every aspect of the motor industry. I even have a taxi vocational licence,' he said, which means he is allowed to drive a cab.<br><br>He is not overly concerned that the market has been cornered by giants. 'We just hope to enjoy the same good (rental) rates as them,' he said, laughing.<br><br>Mr Chua is now choosing colours for his cabs, which will be Toyota Crowns.<br><br>Indonesian Johnny Harjantho has picked light green. Smart Automobile will invest $2 million in the first year.<br><br>The trader, who is in his 40s, is overseas and could not be reached for comment. But company executive director Johnny Ang said it is working with Star Automotive Centre for taxi maintenance, and will set up the call centre at its Bedok branch.<br><br>It will double its fleet to 100 in the first year, he added.<br><br>Meanwhile, Mr Teo of Trans-Cab said his red-and-white taxis will begin plying the roads in January, starting with 50 Toyota Crowns.<br><br>The three new players will eventually have at least 1,200 taxis on the road, because the licence requires each to have a fleet of at least 400 by the fourth year.<br><br>That number would seem like small potatoes for giant ComfortDelGro Corp, which operates about 16,000 of the 19,100 taxis in the industry. It owns CityCab, Comfort and Yellow Top taxis.<br><br>SMRT Corp has 2,000 Tibs cabs, while the rest are owned by private individuals.<br><br>Although no other company has applied for a licence, the Land Transport Authority has not put a cap on the number it plans to hand out.<br><br>Senior transport analyst Teo Hiang Boon of G K Goh said that the impact on the incumbents would not be significant, but 'it will keep the incumbents on their toes'.<br><br>'It's also good for consumers,' he added, 'but it won't be very good for taxi-drivers'.<br><br>Cabby Tony Lim is more optimistic. The 52-year-old does not think having more cabs will mean lower earnings for drivers.<br><br>'If the economy improves and if the population grows, the market can take these players. If the population grows to 5.5 million, 1,200 more cabs is nothing,' the 10-year veteran said.<br><br>'What's important is how hardworking a cabby is and how he raises his service standards.'<br>Copyright @ 2003 Singapore Press Holdings.
