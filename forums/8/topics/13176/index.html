            <div class='col-md body'>The Eagle<br><br>Aiyah...me long time neber come in, busy with project....so ok to start it with aberi beri long one...<br><br>Still wan to discuss, this is my views. if you ppl out there still find it is disturbing to you, then don't continue, this is for all the ppl here... no flames included<br><br>PS: sorry eagle, havn't pay you $$$ for using your name, sent me an invoice.<br><br>--------------------<br><br>Bird exists in different species, to some, the bird is called Eagle. To some others, it might be Dove, Crow, Sparrow. Each in their heart, there is a bird and to me, my bird is called....don laugh... the humming bird (the small small one)<br><br>I am happy as I do not want to live with Eagle as I dun think that a Good Bird will ever throw their birdies into the flames no matter for what reason....cruel. And the Eagle did it many many times to his own birdies, drown them, burnt them. My humming bird will never do it.... no way, my humming bird is kind, he will punish those hummies who is at fault and let them suffer and then welcome them back as they learnt their mistake as always, My humming Bird door is "truly" always open, no terms and conditions applied, no need to sign 2 year contact.<br><br>You see, my Bird will never do that kind of thing, she has given all the birdie knowledge from beginning, it is for birdie to choose right or wrong, they have brains from beginning. The Eagle given the Eaglets no brain, and then the Eaglet eat the fruit of worm and got brains, The Eagle then punished them. What kind of logic is that when you got punished for having brains... as for disobey, yalah, punish, but don need to kill right, somemore to etenity...cruel. Free Doctor, there is no free thing lah, look at the term and conditions in the Book. Anyway, My humming Bird also provide real consultation, she doesn't really cure you, by yourself you are cure, but then the road is very difficult, not easy, but still it is possible, it is not by Believing in Eagle or Daddy and then get cured so easy, you yourself has to put in effort, you will be punished as usual, you will get what you plant, Birdie plant seed get seed, plant rice get rice, fair and square, no eay route out. Even if you repent at your last, you will be punished for the fruits you steal b4 you die. Anyway, there are many doctors around, they are also free ifthe birdie choose to believe them... who will cure you depends, My Humming Bird didn't tell me, anything is possible, no "fixed" ending.<br><br>As for the $10, aiyoh, i will take lah... but who know the consequences, maybe I will become rich with the toto 1 buy...<br><br>The Dragon, talk about the Dragon, i pity him, he does not even exists and yet the Eaglets keep calling him out for war, no wonder the Eagle is so angry, wan to burn some of them to scare other little Eaglets... but you can't blame those Eaglets, they got no brain to start with. Anyway my humming Bird told her little hummings that the Dragon is yourself, it is your own negitive image, yin and yang, good and bad. to fight it, you have to overcome yourslef, it is by overcoming yourself then you can get to a higher level.<br>How can you blame a serpent, worm. The serpent only show the birdie the way, the truth is the birdie make their own choice. The Dragon exist from the beginning of time, as with the Bird. There is no absolute power. As for chasing the Dragon out of the house, aiyah, this is a a cruel thing lah, you chase your own son out? If the Dragon is bad, then the creation of the Eagle is flawed liao, somemore the Dragon neber eat any worms...<br><br>As for the Eaglets, i would say that some neber understand and never have brain to understand, I believe that the Eagle Word is good as in all the other birds, too bad I can't say much about his eaglets. The book is good, but eaglets never seem to undestand all of them, and yet they talk talk so much, just like to talk rite, they can argue with you for the rest of the time, instead of actually saving 1 soul, they instead piss them off... and then they said they will be in fried chicken...  what a pity, I really pity the eagle, sometimes it is not the Eagle fault, but the eaglets.<br><br>Sorry to talk in this way, I just wanna to show rapture and blurblop that what they say is anything big, if anyone know the bible, they will understand and please if the two want to show off your intelligence, please go some where else... and not here...you can email blurblop and save us the trouble. If I write something, you say flame, please do email blurblop directly so to spare me the trouble.<br><br>All right, I know about the Eagle, if you do think that ppl here need guidance, please ask them to email you, you-so-called-eagle-example-piss-me-off-ego...  If you like, I can post 10,000 questions for you and you can never use your Eagle logic to defend it, but if you ask me 10,000  questions, I can answer everyone of them.... got it, show off<br><br>---------------<br><br>I neber say i am perfect,<br>but it is my own views</div>
