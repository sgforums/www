              <p>Life is most enjoyed if a person can pursue his dreams. It takes 
              courage and a strong will to defy the social norm of perception that 
              money is the highest valued purpose. It is also so easy to get confused 
              and deterred especially so during the long journey to pursue a dream.</p>
              <p>Let
               me relate a little of my life. In the height of my life, when I feel 
              everything was right and I wanted to change my career to pursue a dream 
              to put more meaning to my life and turn to a career where I can impact 
              the lives of fellow human positively I quited my comfy job without even a
               securing a new one. I knew I had to do this because the temptation to 
              not move was very strong. But that seemed like the start of the probes 
              and stares that something is very wrong in me from the potential 
              employers I had. The constant bombardment and sometimes even rejection 
              from my job application deteriorated my confidence. I also realised I 
              was not so strong willed as I thought. My children's concern for me if I
               have gotten a new job was comfort for me but also pressured me to 
              quickly find a job!!?? A dilemma that swayed my hopes of pursuing my 
              dream.</p>
              <p>When the opportunities did come that I can serve to help 
              and impact the lives of people in this country, there also came another 
              job opportunity. As I choose the latter job opportunity, I knew failed 
              the test of courage; I failed the test of hardiness; I failed the belief
               of social expection that we work first for money then for the lives of 
              others.</p>
              <p>My take for dreams is that it is elusive and is often 
              very hard. I've not given up hope for life is long enough to try again 
              and again. But I have build up my courage and confidence again and 
              hopefully when the opportunity comes, I will be decisive to sieze it!</p>
              <p>So
               if you want to pursue a dream, have lots of courage, build a strong 
              confidence and remember to sieze the opportunity when it comes.</p>
              <p>May courage and luck be with you!</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>it is still the inner voice that directs your passion towards what is possible though seemingly impossible..to realize it is the action and relentless trials and tribulations..</p>
              <p>there was a time when all leading scientists laughed and ridiculed a hopeless dreamer over the possibility of communication at great distances without wires....they laughed at his idea that it is IMPOSSIBLE and UNREALISTIC to pursue such a dream...."You need wires to communicate from one point to another...wireless is obviously a STUPID and impossible idea of our time "</p>
              <p>In 1901, the first signal was transmitted across the atlantic ocean....wireless telecomunication was born...and with it, radio, TV, satelites, mobile phones all owed to Gugleimo Marconi, Father of Wireless Telecommunication, the once hopeless dreamer...was born</p>
              <p>When Marconi died in 1937, as a tribute, all radio stations throughout the world observed 2 minutes of silence. </p>
