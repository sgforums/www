If I am not wrong, your proposed method involves heavily charging one plate with either positive or negative charge, while maintaining the other plate connected to a grounding or neutral source, with a storage unit as an intermediate between the neutral plate and the grounding. With the variation in displacement generating an alternating current and using a rectifying circuit to convert the current into a D.C. and channelling it into the storage unit, in this case a separate capacitor.

Bar is removed so that the same repulsion don't go against the movement of the wheel...<br><br>4. Yes, you are right on this part.<br><br>Ans: The energy to move the big magnet can be automated by another simple motor linear actuator powered by solar. Obviously the movement of the big magnet does not need to travel large distance and forces of resistance can be reduced by other means...that I will demonstrate later in future video or face to face teaching.</div>
