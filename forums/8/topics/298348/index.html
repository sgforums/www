I am planning a magnetic induction on coils to generate electricity, the magnets don't need to touch the coils hence not much resistance compared to normal hand cranked dynamo.<br>(I will demo this fact later once I test it out on my ideas haha...need time and my next pay to be in first haha)<br><br>And also what I am converting (not creating) are (magnetic + gravity + inertia) to become kinetic energy (wheel rotation movement) and using the kinetic energy to covert to electricity (inducing coils with the magnets).</div></blockquote>What I would think is that it would be kinetic (hand) to magnetic to kinetic (wheel) to electric energy. Gravity and inertia are not really considered forms of energy <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Which means that an external kinetic source is still needed.<br><br>With respect to a hand cranked dynamo, the decrease in resistance isn't much when we upgrade to your design. This is because the axle of rotation is still the wheel. Thus, I still do not really see the advantage of this design. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Simontay78:</div><div class="quote_body">Thanks for your questions! For your question about generating a consistent and reliable voltage is however true, it's just like solar panels that have efficiency of 15% now subjected to weather conditions similarly to windmills.<br><br>The common solution (by windmills) to solve this problem is a charge controller or bridge rectifier or Schottky diode to limit back-flow of electricity back to the coils from the battery. (Not tested yet so not sure correct or not, do correct me if I am wrong)<br><br>Once the battery is charged, the output will be much more consistent then normal and can use "inverter" to change the DC 12 Volts to AC 230 Volts at desired Wattage (depending on the inverter specification for power values)<br><br>I used a power inverter for 1000W hence can possibly run laptops and charge hand phones for a fully charged lead acid battery.<br><br>Do check out the video featured in <a href="http://sgenergycrisis.blogspot.com/2007/07/my-personal-sustainability-project-past.html" rel="nofollow"> my solar LED project</a> on how to use  the inverter to power a Television using a fully charged lead acid battery (big ones).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </div></blockquote>One possible method, which I'm working out for my FYP too, is to design a circuit (capacitor + inductor + power electronics) to store the gained energy into the capacitor (if you cannot make it consistent like a normal generator).</div>

The goal is in 15 years time, they will be able to port such a device over to things like pacemakers, such that the pacemakers may be able to run forever without being taken out every 5 years for battery replacement</div>
