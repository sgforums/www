Anyway if my project were to succeed in the long run (of cuz not by me), then pacemakers might be able to run indefinitely. By converting vibrational energy to electrical energy, my project will be able to harvest such vibrational energy that are wasted when for example, a MRT train moves or when a bus moves. The potential usage for such a possible device is limitless. Best of all, it is a clean/renewable/non-polluting source of energy.</div>

(i.e the working parts wore down before the cost of building the system was met even with lubricants.)<br><br>You were talking about the power source to the wheel, I suggested hooking it up to a dynamo(should be a turbine) using tidal power which is one of the most inefficient way of doing things.(Tides down in the straits are real fickle) Solar energy will not work easily as Singapore is a humid country with a expected 60% power lost to humidity and cloud formations and limited space constraint.</div>

They are not inventors but just trying out a design by some internet website. They don't think of alternatives and solutions to solve the problems they face.<br><br>In terms of Cost of building it vs return of investment, this you have to ask why people buy solar panels and windmills at high cost and the break even period is about 10 years using current electrical tariff?<br><br>It's because the future cost of electricity will be much higher...considering Singapore power is generated using 100% imported pipe natural gas (80%) and expensive fuels like bitumen (tarsands) and oil.<br><br>Indonesia is a OPEC country which recently in 2004 became net oil IMPORTER and had claim to cut gas export to japan by 2010.

Your housing tariff will be paid when you use and the prices fluctuate according to demand and supply every 30 min.<br><br>Be prepare in 2012 when LNG terminal starts in Singapore as Liquefied Natural gas imported from far away countries like Qatar and Australia will be spot pricing traded in competition of demand from the world include CHINA, INDIA, USA, and many other countries like Japan and S.

The "magnetic energy" that you have claimed actually came from your hand, ie you sort of store the kinetic energy into the magnetic field, which then converts back to kinetic energy again. The concept used here is Einstein's Law of Conservation of Energy<br><br>2) Inertia happens only if there is no net input or output of energy (if we view it in the energy way). Which means total energy to the system is still a constant, ie inertia does not generate more energy.<br><br>3) The motion is at the outside of the wheel, thus you felt that it is easier as compared to a hand dynamo. Reason is because although torque required is the same amount, and since torque = force * distance from centre of rotation, less force was used. I'm extremely sure that if the handle of the hand dynamo is extended to be the same or larger than the diameter of the wheel, the ease of turning would be the same.<br><br>The only way this might be more efficient than a hand dynamo, if you succeed, is that there is less weight of the handle to turn the generator, thus enabling the generator to turn faster with the same amount of force. However, the amount of efficiency gained should actually very very little.<br><br>Correct me if I'm wrong in any of the concepts.
