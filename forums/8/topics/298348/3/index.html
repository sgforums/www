The "magnetic energy" that you have claimed actually came from your hand, ie you sort of store the kinetic energy into the magnetic field, which then converts back to kinetic energy again. The concept used here is Einstein's Law of Conservation of Energy<br><br>2) Inertia happens only if there is no net input or output of energy (if we view it in the energy way). Which means total energy to the system is still a constant, ie inertia does not generate more energy.[/quote]<br><br>Ans: Yes, it's not generate more energy but a carrier of energy...a Force instead. It requires my magnet repulsion to gather the inertia. Use a string and tie to a rock and swing it round for a minute and release it, the hand kinetic energy had gain in force call the Inertia and once the hand release it this force will propel it forward. Gravity makes sure it goes down and air resistance will slow it down.<br><strong><br><blockquote>3) The motion is at the outside of the wheel, thus you felt that it is easier as compared to a hand dynamo. Reason is because although torque required is the same amount, and since torque = force * distance from centre of rotation, less force was used. I'm extremely sure that if the handle of the hand dynamo is extended to be the same or larger than the diameter of the wheel, the ease of turning would be the same. </blockquote></strong><br><br>Ans: The hand cranking of the dynamo does not use other assistance forces like gravity and magnetic repulsion to assist the rotation of the dynamo. It's pure hand movement vs the magnetic induction inside the dynamo.<br><strong><br>[quote]The only way this might be more efficient than a hand dynamo, if you succeed, is that there is less weight of the handle to turn the generator, thus enabling the generator to turn faster with the same amount of force.

This is because the magnetic force can work both ways; it can assist in moving, and it also can stop you from moving. In that sense, it is still rather inefficient.

If you can show that once your wheel is set in motion, and that there are no "external" sources of energy required, lest the magnetic field and gravitational field, on the mass of the object, and that the wheel can continue turning for like 1 day non-stop I think it would be good.<br><br>Take for example, you know those small models of "trains" on a magnet strip? The metal object or "train" is able to hover on the magnet strip (bars at certain spacing) and that the magnet propels the "train" forward continuously.<br><br>Take note, try to minimise lost of energy by any friction etc.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

The energy conversion efficiency could be made very close to 100% by reducing friction,..etc...<br>Most importantly: As the energy is converted into electrical energy to be transferred to a load such as a device or a battery, there will be a corresponding opposing induced EMF setup at the induction coils such that it would cause the 'rotation' to slow...etc. (Try dropping a magnet into a steel pipe for instance...if the magnet is very strong, it'll fall noticably slower through due to eddy current induced in the pipe).<br><br>You said: <strong>There's 'one key moving component that is still manual at the moment'</strong>.<br><br>In the most ideal case where friction/resistance are ignored, it'll simply supply X amount of energy to drive the wheel to produce X amount of electrical energy.

Inertia is the resistance in the change in velocity/angular-velocity of a mass. The mass (i.e. the spinning wheel) HAVE TO decelerate in response to a convertion of kinetic energy into electrical energy in accord to the law of conservation of energy. To keep the wheel spinning, the same amount of energy have to be introduce into the system to be added back to the lost kinetic energy (ignoring various mechanism of energy loss).
