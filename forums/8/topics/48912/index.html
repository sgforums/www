            <div class='col-md body'>if you ask me, yes i feel singlish is superior to queen's english. it has come to a point where anyone speaking the latter is held up in a pedestal while we, who speak anything other that the perfect english, are looked down upon as uneducated, uncouthed, uncivilised.<br><br>in china, people from the north speak a different form of chinese as do the people in the south, do they speak perfect chinese? no. they each have their own slangs and uniqueness, if you listen to the chinese from different areas speak among each other, you'll be able to hear the differences, the language is basically the same, it's the slang that differs them.<br><br>in japan, there's standard japanese, spoken in tokyo. and then there's dialect japanese, osaka, okinawa, hiroshima, they all have their own dialect, their own slangs, and yet they're not running around screaming that everyone should speak standard japanese only. in standard japanese, good morning is ohaiyo. in osaka, the slang is oha-.<br><br>every language will have a standard form, used mainly for business, for us, that language is standard english. but the language of the people is singlish. it is a wholly local product, and is not worth feeling inferior about.<br><br>i am a singaporean. when i speak among my kind, i will speak in the local dialect, the local slang, it is known as singlish.</div>

The earliest period begins with the migration of certain <strong>Germanic </strong>tribes from the continent to Britain in the fifth century A. D., though no records of their language survive from before the seventh century, and it continues until the end of the eleventh century or a bit later. By that time <strong>Latin, Old Norse </strong>(the language of the Viking invaders), and especially the Anglo-Norman <strong>French </strong>of the dominant class after the Norman Conquest in 1066 had begun to have a substantial impact on the lexicon, and the well-developed inflectional system that typifies the grammar of Old English had begun to break down. </blockquote><blockquote>The period of Middle English extends roughly from the twelfth century through the fifteenth. <strong>The influence of French (and Latin, often by way of French)</strong> upon the lexicon continued throughout this period, the loss of some inflections and the reduction of others (often to a final unstressed vowel spelled -e) accelerated, and many changes took place within the phonological and grammatical systems of the language.</blockquote><blockquote>The period of Modern English extends from the sixteenth century to our own day. The early part of this period saw the completion of a revolution in the phonology of English that had begun in late Middle English and that effectively redistributed the occurrence of the vowel phonemes to something approximating their present pattern. (Mandeville's English would have sounded even less familiar to us than it looks.) Other important early developments include the stabilizing effect on spelling of the printing press and the beginning of the direct influence of Latin and, to a lesser extent, Greek on the lexicon. <strong>Later, as English came into contact with other cultures around the world and distinctive dialects of English developed in the many areas which Britain had colonized, numerous other languages made small but interesting contributions to our word-stock.</strong> </blockquote><blockquote>The historical aspect of English really encompasses more than the three stages of development just under consideration. English has what might be called a prehistory as well. <strong>As we have seen, our language did not simply spring into existence; it was brought from the Continent by Germanic tribes who had no form of writing and hence left no records.</strong> Philologists know that they must have spoken a dialect of a language that can be called West Germanic and that other dialects of this unknown language must have included the ancestors of such languages as German, Dutch, Low German, and Frisian. They know this because of certain systematic similarities which these languages share with each other but do not share with, say, Danish. However, they have had somehow to reconstruct what that language was like in its lexicon, phonology, grammar, and semantics as best they can through sophisticated techniques of comparison developed chiefly during the last century. Similarly, because ancient and modern languages like Old Norse and Gothic or Icelandic and Norwegian have points in common with Old English and Old High German or Dutch and English that they do not share with French or Russian, it is clear that there was an earlier unrecorded language that can be called simply Germanic and that must be reconstructed in the same way. Still earlier, Germanic was just a dialect (the ancestors of Greek, Latin, and Sanskrit were three other such dialects) of a language conventionally designated Indo-European, and thus English is just one relatively young member of an ancient family of languages whose descendants cover a fair portion of the globe.</blockquote>not from webster<br><a href="http://www.wordorigins.org/histeng.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wordorigins.org/histeng.htm</a><br><br><blockquote>English is a member of the Indo-European family of languages. This broad family includes most of the European languages spoken today. The Indo-European family includes several major branches:<br><br>Latin and the modern Romance languages;<br>The Germanic languages;<br>The Indo-Iranian languages, including Hindi and Sanskrit;<br>The Slavic languages;<br>The Baltic languages of Latvian and Lithuanian (but not Estonian);<br>The Celtic languages; and<br>Greek.<br><br>Of these branches of the Indo-European family, two are, for our purposes of studying the development of English, of paramount importance, <strong>the Germanic and the Romance </strong>(called that because the Romance languages derive from Latin, the language of ancient Rome, not because of any bodice-ripping literary genre). English is in the Germanic group of languages. This group began as a common language in the Elbe river region about 3,000 years ago. Around the second century BC, this Common Germanic language split into three distinct sub-groups:<br><br>East Germanic was spoken by peoples who migrated back to southeastern Europe. No East Germanic language is spoken today, and the only written East Germanic language that survives is Gothic.<br>North Germanic evolved into the modern Scandinavian languages of Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, and Icelandic (but not Finnish, which is related to Estonian and is not an Indo-European language).<br><strong>West Germanic is the ancestor of modern German, Dutch, Flemish, Frisian, and English. </strong><br></blockquote></div>
