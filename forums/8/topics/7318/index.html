            <div class='col-md body'>To put a long story short, not so long ago, my gf confessed to me that she had had sex with her ex b4, and that she felt she should let me know about it. She told me to consider carefully before deciding if I still wish to pursue the relationship. Prior to this, I always thought that I would not mind my partner's past, as long as I love her. But now that it had happened, I really am at a loss. I love her, yes I do, and I had had a lot of wonderful times with her, but right now, I just can't convince myself that the past is past, and I should just not think about it. It's a really painful experience for both me and her, especially when she had to tell me the news in tears. I teared too, I wasn't angry; guess hurt was the word to use. I don't know if I can ever accept this fact. Our relationship will probably not be the same again. Guess I still need time. My advice to all you budding guys and girls out there: don't ever get yourself into a predicament like me. Your chastity is sacred, and it should only be for the one whom you truly love. I used to think that was a whole lot of crap too, but now I know...... hope you don't learn it the hard way like I did...... Anyone can help me?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The throes of being in a relationship, as cliche as this might sound, if you really love her, then you shouldn't mind whether she's still chaste. I know it's something sacred and that you should give it only to the one you truly love, but think about it this way. Will this "truth" change anything? She is still the same girl you fell in love with.<br><br>I'm sure it's not like she's a loose woman or something, maybe back then she felt her ex was THE ONE. Anyway, have a good talk with her about it, she's hurting cos' she doesn't know if you'll still love her. Convince yourself whether you still do, then convince her how you feel.<br><br>(I hope it's gonna be a happy ending for you two.)<br><br>All the best!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I still find it hard to convince myself that I am able to live with that fact. I know she's hurting very much, coz she's unsure what I would do, but neither do I have an answer. Perhaps on my part, deep down, I really want to make her feel hurt, because I'm hurt deeply myself. But then again, that's a really selfish thing to do. I don't know, I'm very confused. I'm human, and I can't just accept so easily what was so suddenly hurled at me. Hope you guys understand. I really do not wish to end the relationship either. But I need to convince myself first that I can still love her the way I did before. I guess that's the only way to be fair to both parties.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sadguy, the person that need to grow up is u.  Yr thinking is very immature n I guess it cos this is yr first relationship.<br><br>Face it.  It is a fact that many guys out there hv more than one sex partners in their life.  How many gals r there out there in Singapore ?<br><br>It does hurts to know the truth.  But times will heal.  I think u r one lucky guy who get to know the truth b4 hving a relationship with her.  Many gals keep it as a secret until they land in bed cos it hurts them more telling it to their love ones.<br><br>Don't forget, by telling u, she wants assurances.  It takes lot of guts to do it for a gal.  Yr actions right now, I am sure, hv disappoint her to some extend although she may not express it n is hoping for the best.<br><br>To be real honest, yr action ( Being so upset, not re-assuring her,.... ) may end of the day make u lose her n u will know that it is too late to regret.<br><br>Cherish what u hv and not what u don't have or lost.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually I haven't had a gf yet to share my experience with you but I would just like to make a little comment.<br><br>Guys will often said they don't mind their gf's past but actual fact that's a lie to some extend.I also tell myself not to mind my gf's past but when it really happened to me then I don't know whether I can still say that.<br><br>One thing is for sure about your gf is that she is VERY truthful to you.I think that is better that she told you now and let you decide whether to continue the relationship with her or not, rather than you go find out yourself.<br>I would say it's pretty common for couple to have sex before marriage these days so your gf is just another case.<br><br>You said that the relationship will not be the same.Yes of course because you'll keep telling yourself that she's not a virgin anymore.<br>Give youself and her a break, try to free your mind from the past and love her with your heart.<br><br>------------------<br>Don't just do it</div>
