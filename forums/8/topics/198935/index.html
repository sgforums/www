            <div class='col-md body'><br>Need to get some advice. Like, for example, a guy has a gf who loves him very much. The man probably mean the world to her so if he did anything unfaithful, it will hurt her badly. Understanding this, so of course the guy don't want to do anything unfaithful to her, but then sometimes he is surrounded by beautiful looking female friends. Sometimes there are temptations to look towards greener pastures etc, if you get what I mean.<br><br>Or another example, you see some items you know you shouldn't spurge money on, but you felt tempted because afterall, you think to yourself, "hey it's the great singapore sale, this is the last pair, today is the last day on offer, if i dun buy, i miss the best bargain in my life!!!" I'm sure many people here may feel guilty about the way they have thrown their money away.<br><br>Such temptations are common. And I have been thinking alot about such issues, it doesn't seems like there is a right or wrong answer, so any advice or comments is much appreciated.</div>

If someone see a $1000 note on the floor, they are likely to pick it up knowing it's not right and they should not take money that does not belong to them, but that's what temptations are. And of coz heard before of people who found a lump sum of money and surrender the money to the police, which is very honest indeed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Ah, I suddenly think of a good example. You know so many people queuing up to buy 4d and toto? If you ask them, most of them know the odds of winning is stacked against them, and they know they shouldn't bet in such cases, but the temptation to win the jackpot is too big for them to let it pass. In such a situation, how will you save these kind of people, what ways will you use or advice to help them resist temptations?<br><br>I am asking partly also because someone close to me is addicted to gambling, his income is only 2k, but his gambling debts is well over 30k. The bookies allow betting on credit. Now the problem I see is that he cannot resist the temptation to win more money.<br><br>If someone has some good ways or techniques to curb temptations, I am sure I can learn alot from it and help "save" my friends as well.</div>

So to sum it up, we can find faults or reasons against the temptation itself to avoid getting caught in it. I'm summing things up because I'm going to compile the answers later.

So you are saying, to deal with temptations, we should first think and reason to ourselves before we do it. The only problem is, temptation touches alot on emotions and sometimes emotions took over logical thinking. Honestly, I believe alot of guys are having affairs outside, some of whom are married, like my dad, and I wouldn't say he's a stupid person who cannot think for himself. I think it was all down to temptations.</div>
