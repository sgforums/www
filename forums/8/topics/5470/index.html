            <div class='col-md body'>tsss...What skill they got?  Every Ah beng I ever saw fighting fight like girls...no offence to girls here.<br><br>Girls,  We are about to get testosterone prone here...so read carefully...:-)<br><br>the last two times I saw a bunch of them fighting, I just stood there and watched with bated amusement...they remind me of chikens /roosters fighting...except without the claws and beaks...basically making them pretty much useless.<br><br>First of all, it's very beng to be skinny like anorexia (not ataraxia..sorry atax), and their jeans must be tight as hell...don't know why..to show off the bones in their skinny butt cheeks when it's "supposedly" flexing while they are fighting...maybe.<br><br>I'm not talking about those Pia Kia types...I'm sure they know how to fight...<br><br>Also, I really look down on people who need help from his gang to beat someone else up... Whether that "gang" can win or not, I still look down on them as wimps...because if u really put them up mano-a-mano, they will most probably cry like the children that they are...<br><br>As for the tight pants...any real fighter will tell u that it's pretty useless wearing tight clothing while fightin...restricts your movements and dampens piower..blah blah blah...<br><br>Yeah yeah, I've been in enough fights to know what I'm talkin' about...with the american equivalent of ah bengs...we call them FOBS.<br><br>If I was a girl, I wouldn't go to a skinny ass ahbeng for protection...Most times I see the beng with his girl and the girl got more flesh than him...shit, i almost feel sorry for her or him...I'm sure that when the crunch time came, she would end up protecting him...you know...snatch him in mid-air so that he won't fly across the street from the first puch impacting his chest by another equally skinny beng....hmm...protection my ass..<br><br>they can't even protect themselve what...Why else u think they need so many brothers around them? ...tsss...protection my yellow ass.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You know what? I share the same sentiments as firewire. I used to tell myself that I should just sign up to be in the police and work my way up the ranks. Be high-ranking enough to start a "Operation Clean Singapore" and put every beng into jail.<br><br>Their very existence irks me. Their attempts to be macho, by talking loudly, by being crude and vulgar...etc.. manz.. where did they get those ideas from? Loud and crude... that's not being manly... that's just being plan obnoxious.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I totally agree with firewire on his views of ah bengs... I hate skinny-ass punks who wear tight t-shirts... first, it makes them look gay and second they look like they go wherever the wind blows... only reason why they tink they so tuff is cause there's like 50 of 'em behind one guy... i doubt they would ever win a one-on-one fight... my brush with ah bengs happened on the bball court in spore. seems to me that only bengs play bball or something (maybe the CC i play in is infested) Anyways, jsut playing a simple game of 5on5 and next thing u know, i get into a pushing brawk with one guy cause he thought i was playing too rough... maybe if he gained like 50 pounds on his puny ass body then he wouldn't fly away everytime i boxed him out... anyways, before i knew it, all his "supporters" from the sidelines came rushing in and his "lao da", whos a pretty big guy sporting tons of tattoo and no doubt a gangbanger came in. then i was like oh s**t, i dun even live in spore and i'm just here for summer and now i'm gonna get my ass kicked by 20 guys... umm... no way... BUT surprisingly, the big brother calmed things down, and we actually finished the game, which we won... hehehe... i count myself quite lucky.. they could have knives and parangs and wat am i gonna do? throw a bball at them? sheesh.. but tehy certainly ruined my exp. in spore .... but YES, they are a NUISANCE and should be picked off one by one by a hired killer <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually I wouldn't consider ah bengs the ostracised ones in society?<br><br>While the government does its best to advertise us as an educated country (which we are, according only to basic literacy figures), while they might try to create the impression of organisation and good clean living, i'm not sure, but if you manage to go out and just take a look around - i think you'd find they outnumber everyone else in the same age denomination.<br><br>They grow up to be older gangsters with bubble-perms, yes, or pimps or open up handphone or VCD shops or whatever, but they're all stil there. They're not a media presence, the power the wield doesn't quite cover anything so highbrow, so you won't hear about them. Talking to your friends of a similar social strata, you'll naturally hear similarly disparaging responses to their kind.<br><br>But of course, while you on this forum spare them no courtesy, they with legs hiked up on chair are doing the same about you. Difference is its probably in hokkien.<br><br>You say they're belligerent, cowards? They say you're soft, arrogant. Same difference.<br><br>They and their kind will always be there though. Presently they're officially known in their various ages and guises as "heartlanders". They're sizeable enough a population to have constant mention by the parliament cabinet.<br><br>How many guys make it to OCS, say, or SISpec? Now compare this to the number in SIRs, as riflemen or other such positions in NS.<br><br>Just cos you don't like them, cos you don't know many personally, doesn't mean they need outing... i dare say they're the majority, in this age group at least.<br><br>Besides, they can be good fun.<br><br>Erm shit a bit long this.

            <div class='col-md body'>Ah Bengs exist because so many young chinese lads feel a togetherness and a sense of security when they're together with their peers. hahaha.<br><br>Actually it's a simple equation. Take 1 small fart (physically and mentally small), take the legacy of all the Secret Societies from the 1960, mix in a bit of canto-pop influence and the associated dressing, and you've got Ah Bengs. Potent in numbers, rather they survive simple because there are safety in numbers.<br><br>I guess the western version of Ah Bengs would be Gansters and inner-city gangs. At least those ppl have class and some style. But those folks also carry out real crime. Drive-bys, drug selling, arms trading. That's real shit. Over here, we have Ah Bengs wanting such a "tough" image, but they bark more than they bite. Why? Because crime here is so low and they probably are too scared to undertake it anyway.<br><br>It's all about image. Being zai with the guys.They don't care what we think. Coz they have safety in numbers and as long as the secondary school environment allows them to proliferate, we'll never see the end of them.<br><br>It's like "yeah so what. I'm a Beng. I don't care what you guys think because i have thousands of other xiong dis backing me up".<br><br>Plus the Speak Mandarin Campaign doesn't help huh? Note that most anti-Beng ppl prefer all things good and englands....whoopse...western.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Heh heh, to me, the term Ah Beng is not so much a style of dressing, but rather a kind of attitude. There are many so-called Ah Bengs around, and there's nothing wrong with them. Sure, they may dress outlandishly, make a lot of noise, attract some attention here and there, but hey, any active group of teenagers out there having fun might behave as such.<br><br>Smoking? Drinking? Playing pool? Squatting on the floor? Scolding Hokkien vulgarities? No need to be a Beng to do all those. So what constitutes a Beng exactly? To me, the term Beng is simply the local equaivalent of a young punk. Read in the papers about those teenagers in Hong Kong who attended a famous triad boss's funeral? Now those are real Ah Bengs, not to be messed with. Here in Singapore? Nah.</div>
