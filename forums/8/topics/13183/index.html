Suddenly, a storm brewed and his boat capsized. Hanging on to his capsized boat in the raging storm, John feared for his life. So he started to pray to God to save him. Very soon, a boatman appeared. "Hey buddy, you looked in trouble, c'mon, hope onto my boat". "No thanks. I am praying to my God. He will save me", replied John. Very soon, another boat came by and similarly offered to help John. "No thanks. My God will help me". Very soon, a third boat passed by and offered to help John. Same rejection from John. "I am waiting for my God to help me".<br><br>Soon, John drowned and died. After his death, he finally met his God. "Oh God, I prayed so hard for you to help me, why did you let me die?", questioned John. God answered "Well, I sent not 1, not 2 but 3 boats along to save you, but you rejected all of them. How else can I save you if you dun accept my help?"<br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.</div>

So as to go in line and not to create any dispute, we have to go along with those stupid act. Otherwise, the situation might turn into bloodshed or worse a crusades when these religious fanatic personnel started to defend their religions just like what you are doing now. The muslim extremist are doing that now during the 911 incidents. So which number you guys wanna choose? 119 to go against them??</div>

"God say kill all jews, he told me thru my dream this and that...etc etc." So hence, we have mass killing to ensure the religion will survive, spread and expand until now.<br><br>Guess if the world is rid of religion, we have one kind of war less i.e. religious war.<br><br>So when is the date to retaliate??? 119??? tell me earlier ok? at least i can start selling off my share before it plunge and then buy in alot at the lowest price.</div>

I also ever hear people praising some Temples, saying that the statue of those god' in the temple perform miraculous things like granting the wish of striking 4D, strike Toto, chasing out evil spirits from the body of possessed people etc.<br>I was a hardcore Buddhist, that's why I know of these things.<br><br>But when a pastor performs exorcism, people think the pastor is lier and they were just acting. They also think the speaking of toungues is demonic .<br><br>This is usually the view I hear from people.<br>Just a question.  So, your view?<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rapture (edited 16 January 2002).]</div></blockquote>When you said hard-core, i guess you are, but in the true sense of buddhism, the buddha didn't give powers to ppl and normal ppl were not able to perform the deeds, it is with high level of study and cultivation, then you would be able to do that, and not many ppl can already, you should know about cult and things like .... as for 4d, toto, buddhism don't really encourage that, they have something called the 8 right righteous way of life, and gambling is not one of them... i guess you are more into the local belief already, ppl has change buddhism, taoism  through thousand of years, as for the spirits chasing, if u are talking about the medium, then they are not from buddhism, they are more towards taoism....<br><br>as to praying in temple, you don know the real essence of buddhism, buddha does not enourage idolism, but he understand there are different level of ppl around, some ppl are clever, some ppl not. so in order for buddhism to cater for different ppl, buddha has different schools for different level. like for me, in buddhism, i can be say to follow the void practise. other ppl might use reading of scripture, some praying...<br><br>as for praying for 4d, toto... this is what the ppl believe, buddha never give number and never will. this is the greed of the ppl.<br><br>even in taoism, the actual way of living is harmony, and not chasing after the winds...<br><br>as for the church, i dun believe cause most of them doesnt convinced me, and to speak in tougues, this is really a god-given grace, and when you said or do things like that, i dun see the power of god behind.... that is why i have lost my faith too... i was once like you, eager and strong with the words, but after a year or so, i guess the word itself is broken... have you ever think about it yrself, the rituals, the tongues, how true they are? have ever think what your pastor said sometime is not so convincing...<br><br>to me the bible itself, if u really understand it, you will find that it is more towards a history book than words of god. and by the way, to let you know, the original bible has a few more chapters which right now the catholic is having and christian has taken them out. and if you ask me, who is the main stream of christian, i would tell you catholic. another thing, ppl normallt tok bad abt christian, and not catholic, becos catholic are somehow more down to earth and peaceful....<br><br>christian are the one emphizing the ends of days, war with satan, rising an army of god... read carefully the bible, matthew, mark, luke and john and the relevation.... and you will get it, maybe not now, maybe not ever, it is yr choice, yr life, you will get the answer one day, dun worry, death will come to all.<br><br>right now, i dun deny god existence, to me god mean many things. as for why i always talk about christian is becos most of them are too in the bible, and talk non-sense... if they keep to their faith and try to convert ppl using actions, like alot of my friend, i got nothing to say,, i am happy too, cause there is a less evil person on earth....<br><br>you see, religion has been there for so many years, i am not just saying christian is not good or what, it is by faith that ppl chose to live. buddhist got bad, taoist got bad, i hope u understand,<br><br>------------------<br>He who knows others is wise;<br>He who know himself is enlightened.</div>
