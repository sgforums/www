To Look Outside of the box. Anyway, in my opinion, the research business has to be about passion and enjoyment. But when, the style of your senior is imposed on me as if she expects me to be like her clone, that becomes unbrearable and suffocating. And she llikes to talk to me like im a 3year old kid, and would at times, just tkae over my mouse at my work station and in a bearing tone say, "Look, i WANT YOUTO DO IT THIS WAY". I was like "duh", common this piece of work aint even for the client yet;its just an internal piece of work for checking and report generating.<br><br>And there is sth i realize about my agency, they are damn inefficient. A lot of work are done manually when the computer could have done it. We are still using a tabulation survey system that was launch in the 1980s. ITs slow and tedious, and merely eats up man hours, whenever say we need to chart or extract data for analysis. And to top it all, these menial work could have been easily done by hiring a temp worker. I thought given my executive pay grade, at least we get to spend some real time doing data analysis but then no, its not going to happen. Because my ANAL-listic senior insists on doing it herself.<br>I think she has done a good job in killing something which i love so passionately before joining it.<br><br>Yup i look forward to your advice. Currently, quite a few people is asking me to stay on the current job, rough it out. But it has come to the stage when i dread going to work already. Dreadful because i do not know what 1)brainless tasks will befall me; dreadful because i know there are going to be tonnes of work that would be done for nothing. You see she has a habit of not being clear in her instruction; and like after spending 3 hours on a piece of work, she can say, "Oh, i think i forgot to tell you this. Can you please re-do this?'.<br>3) I'm concerned about my diminishing intellect capacity, become more and more stupid as each day passes.<br>4) I just learnt that i was the 6th person to hire into the year since Dec 2006. 5 before me have left already. Chee, it shows sth is really wrong with the team.<br><br></div>

I think i did engage in fairly amount of socialization, by going for team lunchs; well actually i didnt like those team lunches, because literally can u imagine what is it like to eat with a bunch of damn-busy-gungho people? it stressful man. An hour lunch break is our entitlement, but yet when you are out eating with your team, my senior and her director usually finishes eating by 20minutes, and expects the whole team to return to the office to continue to "SLAVE" for the company. It grew so out of hand that for the entire last month, i just joined other colleagues in other teams for lunch, or simply ate alone. At least, i get to enjoy one FULL hour of my own time. And heres the Aunt AGONY part, whenever, i didnt join my team, my SENIOR will ask me in a INTERROGATION manner, "hey where did you go for lunch?. You know, you should eat with the team because it CULTIVATES TEAM BONDING". I was like common, who wants to bond with you, you ANAL-listical B*I*T*C*H.<br><br>Perhaps she is sore at me for not joining the team for team lunches? But they are also contradictory at times. There will be on times, that im so SWARMed by their SAiKang, that i chose to eat in office, and She would like, "NO, NO, u Join us for lunch"; and this occurs when she is Bleedly free and when im bleedly BUSY (of course, how can she be busy when all the Brainless saiKang is passed to me?" Despite my intense protests and decline of offer that i will just eat in office, she will say, "Can you finish this in the next 10minutes? if not, u MUST COME with us".<br><br>Alrite, this is another e.g. of her ANAL-listical micro management. She is more concerned about projecting a "unified""Bonded" and "together" team to others to everyone. She wants her own face saving grace to ensure  that no renegrade rOokie fresh grad rebels against her chain of command and all.<br><br>Cheez, so do u stay i should stay or not stay on?<br></div>

Absolutely Zero Hours...<br><br>There are mixed views in the replies. Some urge me to stay on, so say move on. What do you suggest?<br><br>Thanks! ;-)</div></blockquote>Well, I seriously would suggest you leave.<br>To me, its simple. I go to a place to learn, and contribute at the same time. As long as one of it doesn't happen ((a) I don't learn, (b) I am not contributing well), I will leave.<br><br>basically, life is short, I don't like to waste my time just because I think its not nice to leave after a short duration, etc. Its your life. Live it fully.</div>

If you are talking about established market research MNCS, you are still considered entry level grade meaning, u will go through what i go through. As a matter of fact, i have a few MBA grads(with zero work experience) who are going thru the same struggles and pay grade with me now.<br><br>I believe for more realistic experience like you say if u want to have experience doing research project, i thought isn't more appropriate that you go do a Masters (by research) in marketing or sth. It beats doing honors; i believe.</div>

You see they are really afraid of taking risks. Despite the company's slogan being _"Research Revitalized", it aint really revitalied, because they still use very old ancient software, unlike in their U.S offices.<br><br>And when they send a quote to a client, my MNC agency will give it a really HIGH mark-up; and yet when questionsed by client, their reply would be: we are using very sophisticated software( well the bleedly software in running on 1986 OS, think about it), we have very exciting methodology (well trust me, most of the research managers simply want to cheapest and fastest methodology; regardless of how much they claim the methodology is revolutionary); or we need to pay our analyst for their excellent and professional analysis (sure, paying us analysts with peanuts pay and doing really brainless stuff; frankly do not go away with the impression that a pc of research work went through several people in the analysis; frankly its not; my company is damn anal abt it, only the Research director of that team will do the analysis for ALL the projects. So, depending on the mood and time commitment of the research director, the quality of the analysis flucatuates)<br><br>So if you are ever in a Marketing line; and you need to outsource a particualr study to a Mkt research agency (esp those MNC aencies)<br>1) please scrutinize their costing sheet carefully (there would be markups all over the place; question them why it is so high)<br>2)ask them for a lists of all their computer software in use, and ask for the OS system (see my company uses a software running on 1986 OS system KOAZ!)<br>3) if they also bill you on staff costs like cost of staff doing the analysis, please make sure you just pay the cost for the research director thats all. The other labor costs are insignificant.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi there,<br><br>You got quite a boss to handle and satisfy but I don't think at all bosses are generally like that. In fact, just like ppl, it varies vastly out there. U are unlucky to meet a bad boss just at your first job.<br><br>However, I would think that u should pluck up some courage and have a talk with your boss. It's take time for some bosses to trust their subordinate and assign them with bigger roles. You see as a subordinate, it is your job to help your boss and it is your job to help maintain and improve the work of your boss and of course where credit is to be given, it should awarded fairly to u.<br><br>Just like u have learned in school, qn ur boss and tell ur boss and learn and try to understand why ur boss is very particular in how certain work is to come out as. When u have understood, then try to let her understand what u feel.  You may want to try suggesting, then recommending, then acting and doing etc as you get to understand better of the work.<br><br>From what u say, u boss does sounds also like a very detailed boss but if you have been accepting work assigned to u with little questioning (which often is quite common among some fresh uni grad), it is likely to give ur boss the impression u are Mr. Yes with no mind of your own. Understand work especially upfront from the start and not after work is rejected from ur boss. That I think is the crux to reducing the conflicts between boss and subordinate.<br><br>However, when it is majorly a difference in believes it really becomes difficult to work together and if that's the case, u are definitely better off changing job or switching department.<br><br>And all the best in your career.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by tigersushi:<br><strong>As you all may know, I graduated this year and am starting out my so called fresh graduate term in this company. Well, and my line of industry is in the market research industry.<br><br>I feel really sad at work. I feel like I am merely a glorified clerk with a university degree. The work that I am given is menial, repetitive and dull. And the agonizing thing is when I have really this ANAL-ytical senior who is ANAL with nitty gritty items. SHE is ANAL that I conform to her ridiculous work format, like for e.g. questionnaire formatting. The font must be this size, the page margins must be this specification, the spacing and column width in the spreadsheet must be this and this specification. In my opinion, these ANAL-listic requirements are redundant as long as the questions are clear, formatted with correct page view and respondents can see the questions reasonably well.<br><br>There are other incidents of intrusions made by HER. For e.g. SHE has to interfere with the way I checked certain analysis in the spreadsheet. For Jesus sake, each person has his/her own style of checking as long as the findings are correct. But no, she will literally take over the mouse and show me step by step, on how to calculate the findings and present it in a manner which is easy for her to check.  Please do not treat me like a 3years old kid. Common, I have to spend twice the amount of time in the calculations because I have to do extra manipulations to the spreadsheet to show her my working. This is really uncalled for; if she wishes to impose these standards on me, she might as well do the work herself. And if it is not insulting enough, she would check and recheck every piece of work done by me. That is insulting to me because it seems like she can never trust me to do a good piece of work. This is very agonizing.<br><br>In such duress conditions, I have been taught to be ultra-cautious; and that taking risks is a taboo. I cannot do this my way, even if it meant a way which is more efficient because of her ANAL-listic nature. And yet, in my work performance feedback, she can criticize that, I have no mind of my own, and that I am always just a Â“YESÂ” man. Common woman! YOU clamped my mouth shut!<br><br>In retrospect, I know where I stand as a fresh graduate. I understand the need to start from the bottom, to do the so called shit work and slowly earn my credibility and all. But why must it be done according to HER ANAL-listic way, according to HER stupid style? If I can achieve an end result which is the same, why canÂ’t I do it my way? I feel I am becoming more and more stupid with each passing day. [b]<span style="color: red;">I feel like a wild lion</span></strong>, being captured and thrown into the cages in the Zoo. You know how lions over prolonged captivity lose their fighting spirit and shine in their eyes? I am feeling this right now.<br><br>Should I move on and change to another company? I like this market research industry. But it seems that my company is the only MNC agency willing to hire me. I have applied to other MNC agencies but they turned me down. Anyway, to the fresh grads out there, any such similar experience to share?<br>[/b]</blockquote>I thot u are a tiger, why feel like lion???<br><br>The way you anal her, guess it is better to leave, as the chinses say, rather to die then to be torture. So what degree, everyone also have degree mah.<br>some honor, some bachelor, some wear spectacle also hv degree mah.<br><br>Current Unemployement rate 2% only, last year created 100,000 jobs, this year by first half already 80,000 new jobs created, and most are knowledge based jobs. It is an employees market now, it time for you to ask for more...switch jobs for better pasture.<br><br>As a lady myself, i know lady boss is the most hard to follow. Go get any job you want, but make sure the boss is a guy. Learn to tolerant and endure her analing of you. Slowly look for job. Until you find a new job, then leave her, and sex her if you wish.</div>

I think i did engage in fairly amount of socialization, by going for team lunchs; well actually i didnt like those team lunches, because literally can u imagine what is it like to eat with a bunch of damn-busy-gungho people? it stressful man. An hour lunch break is our entitlement, but yet when you are out eating with your team, my senior and her director usually finishes eating by 20minutes, and expects the whole team to return to the office to continue to "SLAVE" for the company. It grew so out of hand that for the entire last month, i just joined other colleagues in other teams for lunch, or simply ate alone. At least, i get to enjoy one FULL hour of my own time. And heres the Aunt AGONY part, whenever, i didnt join my team, my SENIOR will ask me in a INTERROGATION manner, "hey where did you go for lunch?. You know, you should eat with the team because it CULTIVATES TEAM BONDING". I was like common, who wants to bond with you, you ANAL-listical B*I*T*C*H.<br><br>Perhaps she is sore at me for not joining the team for team lunches? But they are also contradictory at times.

Despite my intense protests and decline of offer that i will just eat in office, she will say, "Can you finish this in the next 10minutes? if not, u MUST COME with us".<br><br>Alrite, this is another e.g. of her ANAL-listical micro management.
