But first, I would suggest you to argue in your own way if you want to, with that anal-istic woman. I am fresh grad as well and I am working in a french mnc. My job is great and I love it =D<br><br>I am very sure you can find plenty jobs out there. But if its that particular industry then I have no idea. But you don't deserve to be spoon fed.

Back in uni, i loved the beauty of market research, where you get to do the fun part, the focus group interviews,the consumer observation study, or mystery shopping study where i experimented with interesting medium like video clips, proto type of equipment and all, and then there is the data analysis part, when i get to input all the data into this satisitical software, where i can challenge my limits and utilize every statistical tooL to tell me a meaningful story of what consumers want.<br><br>The analysis part was really thrilling especially when im though to understand what each statistic tooL measures in the Layman, marketer's point of view, and not from a Satistician point of view. That beings the whole element to life!. This is one industry which combines the fun part, (the qualitavtive , exploratory part) with the exciting data analysis part. At least, this is my utopia concept of MArket research in my uni days. FYI, doing Market research module in my uni days were the best time of my life spent in uni. So yeah, reality and utopia do not match right?</div>

You know how lions over prolonged captivity lose their fighting spirit and shine in their eyes? I am feeling this right now.<br><br>Should I move on and change to another company? I like this market research industry. But it seems that my company is the only MNC agency willing to hire me. I have applied to other MNC agencies but they turned me down. Anyway, to the fresh grads out there, any such similar experience to share?<br></div></blockquote>you think yours is worst try mine.<br><br>remember my first job,<br><br>Boss throw 1 whole pile of work for me to do.<br>No one taught me anything.<br>Seniors hack care go drinking and enjoy.<br>I was totally blured.<br>Push myself and learn the hard way.<br>When I finally got it done.<br>My boss backstab me and report to management that i made a big mistake.<br>Kena very badly from the incident.<br>I learnt it the hard way and managed to climb out of it.<br><br>You are lucky to get to MNC on your first job.<br>Treasure it well, there are worst people out there who are willing to stab you in any way you cannot think of.<br><br>Learn first and stop complaining so much.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In one of the companies I worked before, their company policies are structured in such a way that incompetent workers from supervisor, junior manager all the way to middle manager level are weeded out systematically and regularly.<br><br>For normal employee's if they resign suddenly, IA will interview both the employee's and his superior's statement.  If results is inconclusive then no action is taken.  However if its the 3rd person that wants to leave in a row for the same bloody reason...then the superior is hauled up to the gm's room...and if he can't justify why the worker thinks he sux, the aforementioned superior is jolly well fired.   Hiring new workers cost money too for advertisements, delay time, training etc you know...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Edit:  I have to add that managers have a say in picking the staff they want to work under them which have been short-listed by HR.  That's why the manager who got fired deserved it fair and square.  He couldn't work with the people he himself picked.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I know exactly what you mean and how you feel coz I've passed by your way before. Unfortunately that's the way things are in the working world. The key here is to leave our ego at the doorway once you step into the office. Humble ourselves and just do all that we can according to our superior's instructions, however idiotic. As long as it's still work you perform in office, who cares whether it's your way or your superior's stooo-pid way, right? Bide your time. Build patience. Know deep inside you that one fine day, you will overtake your idiotic superior \, spread your wings and soar. But it's not the time yet.......and you just got to develop your patience.
