Wonder if anyone of you actually done a patrol when you actually had to sign the log book at the 4th storey of the bunker. Beside the table, there is a toilet.<br>The building is a very old one and damn eerie as according to my brother. When he signed the book, he heard the toilet flush. As he was the "don't believe in evil" kinda guy he opened the door. When he saw and look inside the toilet is just so eerie that he quickly ran down with his friend.<br>Till today, he don't know why he and his friend heard the toilet flushing thing.<br><br>Anyone has more real encounters?

            <div class='col-md body'>hehhe...thumbs up to virus...ur experience damn scary sia... :p<br>mm..was wondering if anybody here played with the ouija board b4? I used to play something similar to it when I was in sec sch...sorta like a home-made board...and we used a old 50 cent coin to play...remember the old type with the big insect(?)for its tail...not the type we are using now...apparently only the old 50 cent type can work..dunno why<br><br>mm..nothing really really scary happened though except for a few times when we were tired from playing and wanted to send the spirit back but it refuses. So we had to keep asking it politely to return "home". To those who dun really believe that the ouija board wrks...i'm still not exactly sure either...but the coin did moved by itself without anyone of us purposely shifting it.<br><br>The last time we all wanted to play it was when we were at east coast chalet. My fren actually went to buy a real chinese version  ouija board with many many many words written all over in red and this white bowl that was supposed to be used in place of the coin. But when we were about to start saying the chant to ask the spirit to join us...a few of us freaked out coz they simultaneously felt a cold presence behind them which gave them the chills. I still remember that all the windows and doors were shut as the aircon was on...and the few that felt it ( i think was 4) were sitting at different places around the circle. After that, we were all too scared to continue playing with it ever.<br><br>------------------<br>oh well, whatever, never mind...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I had to say this, last time when i was a child, i don't even believe in ghost or anything that is non-scentific. First time my real encounter is from my old house at Lorong H there near still road. My uncle had an operation on his stomach but soon recover.And months later he met an accident in Malaysia and pass away. So one day when i am sleeping on my bed, i saw him standing beside me watching me sleep. His face is not bloody like in the movie or wat. He is just like a human being just that his face is abit greenish. Second time is at east coast park when i decided to urine near a tree since i can't find any toilet and behind me is a deep forest where u can't see your own finger if u walk into it. Then halfway through i turn around and saw a lady with her hair covering her face wearing a silky red dress standing around 50m from me. Third time i saw is also at east coast when i was lying down on the bench, i saw a chubby old lady face on the tree smiling looking at me. This is the first time i saw this kind of thing without a whole body. Her face is damn chubby and make it seems so eerie.<br>If u ask me my reaction when i saw these things, what can u expect? this is real guys believe it anot.<br><br>------------------<br>Â®To The Maximum Limit Of My LifeÂ®</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I heard of ppl saying the reason why some ppl can see ppl from other dimensions, or other entities.. or wat we called ghost  is cos they got tht... same frequenc?Y? or tht ability to. Forntately, most of us are unable to. As for ouija boards, we find it harmful?? or dangerous to call out spirits but in the west, they see it a from a diff point of view. They believe in these spirits and claimed that these spirits have helped them in one way or another. THey call them spirit guides or angels. Again, all these come under teh New Age thingie. I have tried a modified ouija but only for a short while. IT seems to work, but tht time i was s till young and dint know wat it exactly was. But now u ask me to try, i dun think it will work for me again. Perhaps i just lack tht ability to communicate with other entities.<br></div>

First time my real encounter is from my old house at Lorong H there near still road. My uncle had an operation on his stomach but soon recover.And months later he met an accident in Malaysia and pass away. So one day when i am sleeping on my bed, i saw him standing beside me watching me sleep. His face is not bloody like in the movie or wat. He is just like a human being just that his face is abit greenish. Second time is at east coast park when i decided to urine near a tree since i can't find any toilet and behind me is a deep forest where u can't see your own finger if u walk into it. Then halfway through i turn around and saw a lady with her hair covering her face wearing a silky red dress standing around 50m from me. Third time i saw is also at east coast when i was lying down on the bench, i saw a chubby old lady face on the tree smiling looking at me. This is the first time i saw this kind of thing without a whole body. Her face is damn chubby and make it seems so eerie.<br>If u ask me my reaction when i saw these things, what can u expect? this is real guys believe it anot.<br><br></div></blockquote>Telok Kurao Lorong H?(dunno how to spell)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For me, I never encountered any sighting but feeling I did experience.<br><br>It wasn't exactly feeling on me.<br><br>Ok heres what happen...<br><br>You know in Changi got those SAF chalet. Near the chalet was a broken down small hospital. The windows all are sealed by wooden planks.<br><br>Being adventurous young teens, we decided to explore it since we're all bored at the chalet.<br><br>Before I entered, I could light up my lighter. When I entered the building, my lighter just goes off, no matter how I tried to light it up.<br>I went out a bit and funny thing is my lighter could light up again.<br>Therefore, I step inside the building with my lighter and it goes off once I am inside.<br>I repeated the proceedure a few times together with my close friend. He saw it and so did I but not the rest of the gang.<br><br>We feel scared and ran back to the chalet immediately. Both of us was called pussies cause we refused to go in and explore with them. I don't know whether it is a coincident or what but it is just too odd.<br><br>Anyway, another friend who had went in with the gang said he saw something whitish in one of the room but he kept quiet until he went back to the chalet. I wonder.... was I lucky or was I being over suspicious back then.....<br><br></div>
