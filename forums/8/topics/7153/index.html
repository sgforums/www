            <div class='col-md body'>I wonder if you guys have encountered this b4, sounds like a common encounter....<br><br>I sleep on this double decker bed, with my brother below me. Sometimes I wake up and felt the bed shaking, and I thot it my brother having nitemares. However one day, I woke up to the shaking bed and I looked down, my brother wasn't there.......then there was another time I felt something moving under my bed in a large circular route, at 1st thot my brother was being bo liao, using his leg to kick me, but he denied vehemently and I guess its takes a gymnast to be able to do achieve that feat, so what was it.........<br><br></div>

When doing a three-point turn to go out...I winds down the window to see behind my car. I somehow got a chills creeping up my spine. There is no strange encounter..just kinda funny feeling...I just turn my car and drive..back out to the PIE.<br><br>Hey guys and gals..maybe you all could try it out..hahaha.

            <div class='col-md body'>hey tommy.<br>its worse when u are alone driving down that dark road. especially when its so under used.<br><br>i took a cab once after clubbing and i told the taxi driver to go thru mt pleasant cos it was a short cut instead of going to PIE and he turned to me and said he would prefer if i didnt and got this really strange look on his face. seeing how serious he was. i didnt argue with him.<br><br>safe away from that road, he told me of several encounters when he was driving along the road where he felt chills n heard weird sounds. so ever since then he never went that route again.<br><br>on the hindsight i could have been a victim of being cheated of a couple of cents going by PIE listening to his story instead of taking the short cut. haha  :p<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey guys I had experienced a very interesting encounter at "Pulau Tekong" during the early 90's. I was there for some field training(during my N.S). It was a Freeking thursday night, I still remember the night- [It was a no-moon night]. Total darkness everywhere..<br>We had to patrol around the island thruout the night, As we were patrolling, we heard some footsteps from our rear. It was getting heavier and heavier. So we took cover among the trees. We waited very anxiously to see who it was. Almost 5 minutes has passed still no sign of Humans, but only the footsteps could be heard. We waited and waited ... Then came the moment..........<br><br>I was the first one to see them, They were the World War II soilders -- some without legs,hands. They were in FULL BATTLE ORDER.  And among them there was this person who was walking withtout his HEAD.<br>I falled ASLEEP after seeing him.I meant I Fainted at that very spot followed by the others.  The next day my OC had to come searching for us. They found us Sleeping, and almost charged us. But after hearing the story, he dare not conduct anymore exercise at night for quite sometime.<br><br>Guys this may sound as the SINGAPORE GHOST STORIES, But this was an true encounter.  That is one of the reasons why there isn't anymore night trainings on Thursdays....<br>It's a TRUE STORY.......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually about the "NO TRAINING ON THURSDAY IN TEKONG", I heard about many many versions, don't know which version was true though.<br><br>One I heard this from my Uncle,he said that during the 80s, young men used the old tekong camp, think most of the new recruits now use the new tekong camp. Supposely, they had a march on thursday night. So as you all should know, there are all this stations where you would do a headcount. Well, the sergeant incharge of that section did a headcount at every station. When they reached the last station, there was a lack of 1 man. The sergeant did a headcount 3 times and still one man missing. A search on the whole island was done, 2 days later a corpse was found. Dried of blood and smelly.<br>So? My uncle just said, thats all he knows about it.<br><br>Seems very "ficticious" to me, but oh well, anyone has their real encounters or stories from relatives?

            <div class='col-md body'>dunno whether u can call this scary.....<br><br>I think it was like 2 yrs back, my class had a chalet at pasir ris, and we din sleep the whole night. then at abt 5 am, one guy suggested to go to the beach to watch the sunrise, but however we went the wrong direction.<br><br>then the whole group of us saw a person walk past us ( we were walking rite under the lamp post ) an we saw no shadows beneath him or her.....<br><br>then that person juz walked into the trees and dissappeared....... juz to appear 10 to 20 meters away in front of us again........and oni a few of them saw that person the second time......<br><br>after that, we juz ran back..........<br><br>------------------<br>Sumtimes i think to myself," y do i haf to be suffering in silence?" then i hear a voice," it is because u will get sumthing better in return for what u have missed out."<br><br>If that were true, i really hope that what i want will really be mine soon.....<br><br>Sumtimes, I feel very lost, but I always believe that following ur heart may be the best choice out......</div>

Yah you guys said there was a periodic head count that goes like this.. "NUMBER OFF!!!" "1!" "2!" etc.... and so it went... sometime after midnite when they numbered off, (there were 12 of them) after the last guy no. off a voice shouted 13...... they freaked out and ran forward....... some how after they regrouped the last guy was no where to be found. Then the next morn they found his fullpack and et blade and stick next to his body near a tombstone neatly packed together wif his intestines......</div>
