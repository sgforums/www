            <div class='col-md body'><strong>IN THE 90s</strong><br><br>Meet at Sparks Disco tonight, OK?<br><br>Where do Ah Bengs and Ah Lians hang out, and what do they do there?<br><br><strong>NGEE ANN CITY </strong><br><br>AH LIAN totters on her white platform shoes<br>around the open space outside Ngee Ann City.<br><br>It is Saturday afternoon. She is sweltering<br>under the hot sun, but her Versace sunglasses<br>are perched on her head, holding back her<br>yellow-brown hair, instead of shielding her<br>eyes from the UV rays.<br><br>She takes a quick look around at the groups<br>gathered on the steps and in various corners of<br>the plaza. Spotting her best friend, she sashays<br>over. As she passes the groups of girls in tube<br>tops and low-waist pants, she turns up her<br>nose.<br><br>"Yeee...wear so sexy in the day. Chow ah<br>lian,'' she says to her best friend.<br><br>Suddenly, her Prada-look-alike bag emits an<br>electronic ringing sound. "Arlo,'' she yells into<br>her mobile phone. It is her boyfriend, Ah Beng.<br>"Meet at Sparks Disco tonight,'' he tells her.<br>She says: "OK.''<br><br>When the conversation ends, she does not put<br>her phone back into her bag. As she always<br>tells her friends: "Got, must show off, mah.''<br>She gets money to buy the phone from<br>working in a karaoke lounge.<br><br>And what does she do there? "Sing song only,<br>what. One night, if good tips, can earn a lot<br>money, OK!''<br><br>But ultimately, Ah Lian wants to become a<br>model. So does her best friend, and the two<br>have gone to Cover Looks to get their<br>makeovers and portfolios done.<br><br>They get bored with hanging around and<br>watching the other groups of Ahbengs pretend<br>to punch one another, and hordes of other Ah<br>lians puffing away on their cigarettes. So they<br>decide to go shopping inside.<br><br>Just then, a meek-looking reporter approaches<br>them. "Excuse me, I am from The Straits<br>Times. Can I interview you for a while?''<br><br>"For what?'' Ah Lian asks, suspiciously.<br><br>"Just want to know if you think those girls over<br>there are ah lians?''<br><br>"Of course lah, wear until so sexy. And you got<br>hear them talk or not? So vulgar!''<br><br>"Eh,'' the reporter hesitates. "Do you wear sexy<br>clothes?''<br><br>"Yah, got.''<br><br>"Do you use swear words?''<br><br>"Yah, got.''<br><br>"Eh...has anyone called you an ah lian before?''<br><br>"Got! But I not one, OK! I tell them back.''<br><br>At this point, she gets a little agitated, and<br>raises her voice. The reporter says a hasty<br>"thank you'' and beats her retreat.<br><br>Tired of walking around, the girls head for the<br>atrium in the basement, towards the huge video<br>screen there. Hundreds of other lians and<br>bengs are hanging around, mostly squatting or<br>sprawling on the floor, watching the music videos, which alternate between Hongkong<br>and Taiwanese singers, and Spice Girls and Boyzone.<br><br>Before they know it, night casts a shadow over the buildings outside. Inside the mall,<br>the clothes get shinier, the make-up thicker and the platform shoes higher.<br><br>Ah Lian is now outside Sparks disco on the seventh floor, under the neon<br>green-and-yellow sign. She has been paging Ah Beng for the last half hour.<br><br>Just as she is ready to storm off, a lime-green Honda Civic pulls up next to her, its<br>engine revving powerfully. Ah Beng winds down the window and the thumping bass of<br>techno music is heard.<br><br>"Why so late?'' she pouts.<br><br>"Sorry lah.''<br><br>How can she not forgive him? Dressed in a tight bright yellow shirt with front zip and<br>white Valentino jeans, the silver bolts on his black Versace belt standing out, he looks<br>so handsome.<br><br>With the streaks of green in the fringe of his hair, some people say that he looks like<br>one of the Grasshopper guys, or a Chinese version of Nick from the Backstreet Boys.<br>She once stood up in front of a bar in a pub and announced proudly: "My boyfriend is<br>Ah Beng.''<br><br>Soon all their friends arrive, mostly on their Piaggio motorbikes. There are about 15 of<br>them, the usual crowd for a Saturday night outing. Inside, the dance floor is already<br>packed with bodies shaking and grooving to the latest Euro-dance tunes. At the bar,<br>bourbon cokes and vodka limes are being gulped down.<br><br>But those drinks are out-dated. The "in'' things these days is alcoholic soda, e Thirty<br>Three especially. Ah Lian orders a long island tea, an all-time favourite with the Lians.<br>Ah Beng is a beer drinker. But he will not be caught dead with Tiger or Anchor. It is<br>Corona, from a bottle, with a slice of lime, for him.<br><br>The hapless journalist who had approached Ah Lian earlier slips quietly next to Ah<br>Beng and asks him: "Excuse me, are you an Ah Beng?'' He gives her a look she will<br>never forget - not threatening or leering, but a look that only a Beng can give.<br><br>"That day I went to watch movie, someone call out: "Ah Beng!' I thought call me. Turn<br>out it's that Ah Beng fellow from Army Daze. He also watching movie. So you say I<br>Ah Beng or not?''<br><br>Silenced and feeling out-of-place, the reporter merges into the crowd, and Ah Beng<br>tells his friend: "These ang moh types keep calling us Ah Beng. They think their England<br>good then so what?''<br><br>He looks around for Ah Lian. But she has gone to the toilet. Inside the ladies, it is<br>smoky and crowded, and at least 10 ah lians are elbowing for space in front of the sink<br>for a look in the mirror. Ah Lian is wearing shiny eye-shadow, dark lipstick and nail<br>polish. Out of the corner of her eye, she notices an ah lian staring at her. Wah, looking<br>for fight is it?<br><br>Fights are common. Just last week, some ah beng had insulted her, and her Ah Beng<br>stood up for her, confronting the guy with his friends. "He not gang type what. He just<br>protecting me,'' she told her best friend after the incident.<br><br>Ah Beng drives off into the night, with Ah Lian in the front seat. Aqua's Barbie Girl is<br>blasting from the car's audio system. Thus ends another episode of Ah Lian and Ah<br>Beng in their fantasy Barbie and Ken party world.<br><br>But there is always next Saturday.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>MARINA SOUTH</strong><br><br>ON A typical Friday night, Michael and his group of four "brothers'' hang out at the<br>Marina South food centre. For $10 each, they get to savour a two-in-one buffet under<br>the moonlight.<br><br>At about 10pm or so, after three rounds of the buffet and a lot of idle chatter<br>punctuated with some off-the-wall Hokkien exclamations and profanities, they hit the<br>windy corridor of a nearby arcade.<br><br>Squatting there, cigarettes in hand, the secondary school boys continue with the latest<br>gossip, stealing glances occasionally at the many girls in gaudy fake designer wear, who<br>click-clack in their heels around them, arms linked with each other as a sign of sisterly<br>affection.<br><br>Theirs is a common fashion code. His friends are dressed in identical shirts and brands.<br>The girls, all ready to flaunt their flat tummies and porcelain flesh, opt generally for<br>skin-baring outfits in blacks and whites - colours for a night out at the disco.<br><br>From time to time, to attract the boys' attention, the girls talk in loud, shrill voices, or<br>slap each other's backs in a show of excitement. In return, the boys swear and imagine<br>themselves to be the macho men in Hongkong triad movies .<br><br>A little later, groups of them start to throng Canto Pub, where they boogie with<br>abandon to America's Top 40 hits and Cantonese and Mandarin pop until after<br>midnight. On some nights, there are hot acts, like the immensely-popular Cantopop<br>trio, Grasshopper, or Taiwanese pop singer Zhang Huimei. This is when the pub is<br>packed to the gills, with some half-drunk carousers taking liberties, like prancing on<br>their seats.<br><br>There are occasions when the dancing, drinking, and girl-watching at Marina South<br>turn ugly. Vulgarities are shouted, fights are picked. But most teenagers is just looking for good,<br>clean fun.<br><br>"The party ends at 3am, with kids dialling for taxis on their mobile phones. But not<br>everyone goes home. Some sprawl over sidewalks or on the stairs of bowling alleys,<br>and chat till dawn.<br><br></div>
