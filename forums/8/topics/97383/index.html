Do perk up in life. There are somethings in life worth living for but ultimately, live for yourself.<br>I was once there, suicidial, depressed and was in a period of massive soul searching and self reflection and I live for myself. You are in Uni at least. Folks like me, running out and about with an ITE cert, trying to improve and time is against me, being a male. It's not easy but someday, I want to look back on life and laugh at it. Work hard. Don't give up. Oh. life isn't all about who gets the girls or the money. It's the self-satisfaction and the learning process you get out of completing a task you have set out to do or a problem you face right now. Go on, take the dive into life and hold on. You'll be surprised at the things you never thought you could do.</div>

I don't know what I want to do.
