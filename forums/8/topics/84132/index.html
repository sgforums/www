            <div class='col-md body'>On technology in Thailand.<br><br>Pantip Plaza along Petchuburi Road is the Sim Lim Square of Thailand. Advertising styles of pasting pricing on boards outside the shops are just like how we do it at Sim Lim Square. On the highest storey of the mall is a huge IT superstore the style of Challenger at Funan Center.<br><br>Pirated software and VCD shops fills Pantip Plaza. There's a raid alert when I was there 2 days ago. The pirated stores were shut and the people tending the store were standing just outside waiting for the raid alert to end.<br><br>Pricing were slightly cheaper than Singapore's. Creative Vibra 128 sound card is selling at 500 Baht (roughly S$1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Computer softwares (original ones) are selling for between S$200 - S$1000. Roughly the same as Singapore prices.<br><br>Basically, apart from pirated software, whatever you may find at Sim Lim Square, you find them at Pantip Plaza.<br><br>Computer games cost between 99 to 699 baht. 500 baht = S$18, well within the reach of anyone who could own a PC in Bangkok. The boxes and manuals are in Thai, but the game's in English. I believe this move is made to curb piracy. Its simple really, just price it within the willingness to pay of the regular Thai citizens and they will buy it.<br><br>Original VCD and DVD are cheap too. Return of the King sells for 199 Baht (2 DVD edition) English with Thai subtitle.<br><br>Xbox and PS2 games are supra expensive. These are imports, unlike PC games, VCD and DVD, which are localized thai editions.<br><br>Localized computer books on networking and programming are novice at best. If you wish to learn J2EE, design patterns or EJB, the only avenue is via imported titles which retails at 2200 baht or more. So it's not surprising to learn that in Bangkok, IT skillsets are still probably 2 years behind Singapore.<br><br>Online gaming is hot. Ragonok Online is everywhere. Internet Cafes, LAN gaming centers can be found in every corner.<br><br>Is there room for growth in technology in Thailand? The answer is a resounding yes. There's so much more that can be done. Half the retail stores I stepped into are still on cash registers instead of POS systems. There's loads of potential to explore as long as one is willing to price his IT solution within the Thai's willingness to pay.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>On the transportation system<br><br>No change to roads. Traffic jams are still everywhere. It would still take you up to an hour to travel 5KM by bus or car. I doubt this problem will be solved anytime soon. Bangkok expanded too fast and without proper planning. Buildings and roads appeared haphazardly and thus the mess.<br><br>However, if you knew your way, travelling around Bangkok City is a breeze. The skytrain system (BTS) has 2 seperate lines, and will take you through the busiest part of bangkok City, from Sathorn to Siam, Patuwam, Ong Nut.<br><br>When you find yourself at places that BTS do not serve, simply hop off and take a boat ride along Chao Praya river.<br><br>When all else fails, walk.<br><br>MRTA, Bangkok's underground subway system will open on the 3rd of July 2004. On Sunday, I had the priviledge to travel from Silom all the way to Bangput (near Thailand Culture Center) and then back to Hua Lumpung railway station at China town. Travelling on the MRTA on Sunday was by invitation only. The officer probably saw that I was a foreigner and offered me a complimentary ticket free of charge.<br><br>The interior of the stations are just like Singapore's new Northeast line, if not better. Contactless ticketing system, large and beautiful murals and sparkling clean granite flooring all adds to the lavish deco of Bangkok's MRTA system. The down side is that MRTA is not connected to BTS. For example, to take the MRTA from Silom, one first have to alight at Sala Daeng BTS station and walk for 10 minutes.<br><br>The MRTA, the BTS, the boat rides at Chao Praya river, the motobike taxis and tutuks adds up to the number of ways one can travel (and on time) in Bangkok City. Succumb to a cab ride, and you find yourself taking one whole hour to travel just 1 KM.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>On scams.<br><br>The most famous Bangkok scam is what many call the Thai Gem Scam.<br><br>The scenerio usually goes like this. You go into a tuk tuk or a cab and say you want to visit.. say, the grand palace. The driver tells you that the grand palance is closed for some ceremony and suggest that you visit another temple.<br><br>You reach that temple, and start making your rounds when another thai (or a caucasian!) approaches you to tell you that the thai government is running a promotion to sell thai gems to foreigners at a low price. You could bring the gems back home, sell them, and make a bundle.<br><br>You will then be convinced to make a trip to a gem store, buy gems for tens of thousands baht, only to have them valuated at less than 1/10th of the prices when you are back home.<br><br>I had people approach me to pull off this scam on my 1st and 2nd trip. Now I walk and behave so much like a local that nobody bothered me at all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>On scams 2.<br><br>However, on my last day in Bangkok, I was doing some last minute shopping at MBK center for my gf (who's sick and resting in the hotel) when a chinese guy approached me.<br><br>He asked if I am a Singaporean and whether I speak cantonese. I told him I am but I don't speak cantonese. He said he hasn't spoken mandarin in years but he would try. He said he lost his wallet during dinner at Yaowarat (china town in bangkok) and asked if I could lend him some money to take a bus home. He showed his passport, flipped through it but strategically, covered the photograph with his thumb.<br><br>I lied that I worked in Bangkok and wouldn't return within a week or so. He then asked if I could give him some cash, then he would get his family to send money to my family in Singapore. I refused flat but asked for his family's contact in Singapore so that I could get them to call him. He simply said that his kids were working in Hong Kong and he would ask someone else for help then walked away.<br><br>Nice try. haha. In Bangkok, even if you were a caucasian, you find that caucasians (with kids in arms) approach you to ask for money because their wallets were lost.<br><br>Our basic instinct tells us to assist our countrymen. But think straight, so that you do not fall victim to scams like this.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am continously memerized by Bangkok's vibrance. Nobody will fall for Bangkok for its dust, dirt and chaos.<br><br>However within chaos, one finds order. And the greatest challenge is that anyone can be instrumental to put change into effect in Bangkok.<br><br>There's room for growth for at least the next 5 years in everything you wish to do in Bangkok.<br><br>It could be in IT, construction, biotechnology, even as teachers in language schools.<br><br>When one tells you that Bangkok is beautiful, he has seen beyond Bangkok's traffice jams, its dusty roads, slums and squatters. Like the emerald buddha sitting at the grand palace today and once wrapped in clay for decades, Bangkok is a gem whose potential is only as vast as the imagination of its explorer.</div>
