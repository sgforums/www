            <div class='col-md body'>Freedom of Speech - institutionalised in the constitution, recognises the basic right of citizens to expression without fears, distress or oppression.<br><br>If free speech is the process to humanity, freedom of speech is the pre-requisite of such process. Freedom of speech provides the legitimacy for each of us to participate in the course of our pursuit.<br><br>Moderation shall be seen as the set of tools utilised to enhance a favourably environment for individuals to exercise their rights without destructive interference of another. Moderation is no excuse for the exercise of judgemental biases. It must be restricted only as the role of facilitation, and anything more than that, will disfavour the process of free speech.<br><br>In further, one should also must have a clear concept of defamation and free speech, and not be confused the former and latter. While free speech entails the basic right of us to expression, there is another legal instituion which protects citizens from slender. Defamation suits normally serve as restitutive course to uphold one's reputation and integrity where false or inaccurate representation to the victims result their deterioration.<br><br>Both free speech and defamation have no direct nexus, therefore should not be argued that the fear of defamation be an adequate concern to curb free speech.

            <div class='col-md body'>Let ask yourself honestly - are all the forums a free speech area?<br><br>But many of times, you will see that the term "free speech" is just nother "gimmick". Many forums come with escape clauses, guidelines, and are operated on the principles of the operators. Then, perhaps you can ask yourself another question:"What are their principles?"<br><br>Let us assume that on the principle, there is a forum is indeed the bulwark of free speech. Maybe you can ask the next question:"What course are they embarking?" Are they providing an alternative medium for the voices of opinions and expressions? What their end for such provision of means?<br><br>The rights to remove or edit threads is the privilege the owners, and such exercise of right normally is accorded to the guidelines of the forum which operater dictates. As long as the guidelines say, the users just have to abide. For example, if you are invited to a private "free for all" party and the owner requests you to remove the shoes for entry. You can take it for access or leave it, as private property bestowed the owner the entitled rights. But, is that party really free for all?<br><br>Now, perhaps you can ask yourself again:"is there existence of "free speech" in the first place or just a misnomer?<br><br>Deleting or removing of threads has no nexus to do with the right to freedom of speech as such freedom is bestowed by the constitution. But, one should also remember that freedom of speech itself is not an justification of making false or inaccurate representation. And, now you can ask yourself again:"What freedom of speech entails you?"<br><br>The motives of self censorship can be multi-dimensional or multi-variant. The generic purpose is to maintain a favourable environment in accordance to the acceptable institutional norms and practice. But self censorship in certain case has also been used to offer some proposition on the table. Censorship should not be used to oppress the espirit de corps of "free speech". Rather, it serves to preserve it. Finally, you can ask yourself another question:"What the purpose of the deletion of threads?"<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by firewire:</div><div class="quote_body">So Dear Danieal, wat u r saying is that basically, their removing posts and threads is wrong just because it insults and makes the person look bad.<br><br>That is separate from the right of free speech.<br><br>By being biased , thread removals go against the very idea of freedom.<br><br>???? please enlighten in laymens terms..thnx</div></blockquote>[This message has been edited by Dear Danial (edited 14 November 2000).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by Dear Danial (edited 14 November 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I dont understand what you really meant by free speech. Even in America ( supposly u can say anything you want. you can get sued for saying the wrong things) I cant all of us feel the same way. Just put yourself in peoples' shoe. Mabe ppl are toking behind my back, but i dont care. I cant please everyone so i make the best of it. All I know if I make a statement, ppl will make judgement on me. Impression will be cast. be it good or bad, nothing can be change. I wish to tell you ppl you are free to say what you say but think over what you say before you say it.</div>

I know it's really hard to practice freedom of speech...but my main concern here is..why are some threads moved and delete when they target a moderator or their gf? and other forumites must stand the flaming? even when someone flame your mom?!  I don't understand the just of this...and what are the grounds for moving/deleting threads?!<br><br>------------------<br>Float like a butterfly...sting like a bee...<br><br>join me @ #sgclub</div>
