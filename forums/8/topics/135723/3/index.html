Guys are physically stronger than females, thats why the govt made them undergo NS. And please take note, if you take up any government position, a guy (with NS records) 's pay is always higher than a female's.. did the females ever complain about that?<br><br>I was just saying that both genders are contributing to the society in their own special way. And both should be respected equally too. Just incase people like you don't get it.. i shall give some examples ( Males are respected for all their efforts and time spent on serving and protecting our country &amp; civilians and females are respected for the well being of their family, future generations and household.. and working females contribute to the economy too. And not forgeting, there are females in the SAF, SPF, defending our country too. - and i salute to them.. they serve the country on their own will, these people (both men and women) sure deserves more respect than those whiners)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>NS can be fun n enriching or it can be toturous n painful , it is all up to the indivdual's mindset n his willingness to take it in a positive or negative view . If u r active , u would find the meaning in ns rather than jus emptyness in ur 2 yrs . Frens have told me tat the people tat they met cant be compared to the people u met in other yrs .Barely 3 mths of bmt , u earned urself some comadres n die hard frens , tat is if u wan it . If u lan lan go in complain this n tat , not proactive , not interactive , of cos the life would be painful n colourless. This is a growing up process , u learn to view the world in a further horizon , which ultimately gives u a upper hand in later part of ur life . But notice , all of these would take place if u take ns positively.<br><br>Well , there's no need to compare countries' army with ours nor there shld be a justification on whether females shld experience any ns . China so big , yet their currency is smaller compared to SG dollars ? Seriously , would guys wan all gals to go in , come out with muscles n rough skin ? Or they remain smooth n white , which r more feasible to our eyes ? I bet few would wan the former to be their partner rite.lol<br><br>If u die die oso koe u cannot escape ns , jus face it lor . Be a man take up that mini challenge , wont die wat , in fact u get paid mthly .Moreover ns nowadays r more relaxing n hygenic , i remembered my father used to say tat they had to clean toilets , those flity ones . But according from my ns frens , they said they had cleaners to do for them now.<br><br>Standard of living has raised , ns quality is better , gals getting prettier , come on , its jus part of life . <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with silvergal, women both sexes derserve the appropriate respect. Women DO contribute positively and tangibly to the country and society.<br><br>I guess the main thing dissing guys off is that we neither see nor experience this respect when serving the nation. In fact, we experience the opposite, discrmination! The only time this respect issue surfaces is during rethorical arguments like this one.<br><br>To clarify certain arguments brought up in this neverending debate:<br><br>Govt sector DOES give higher pay to guys with NS, but the private sector does NOT need to if they dun want to. ie gals and guys without NS and guys with NS are all given the same pay.<br><br>Childbirth is a CHOICE. Unless of course if you were raped, then you won't hear us telling you to stop whining. No one held a gun to your head and forced you to give birth. NS is NOT a choice. If it was, you won't hear much whining. Why? Because its a choice! But at this point, there is someone holding a gun to our heads, forcing us into national prosti... i mean NS. If you dun believe me, go check out the danger sign outside every army camp. The words are for civillians, the picture (of 1 guy shooting the other) is for us.<br><br>According to statistics, women are CHOOSING not to give birth! What happened to the noble argument about service to the nation, honour for your country, contributing to the stability of the country etc? Your country needs you! (and your baby). Our country needs ppl to work for the FT! Without our most valuable asset, the FT won't exploit us anymore and the country will experience economic collaspse! All these because women refuse to listen to their OWN argument about national duty etc and push a few miserable kids out!<br><br>Gals always say "Let the guys give birth". My response? Great! I wanna bear my own children. PM me the details. ALL guys dun mind giving birth. You go create the technology, we'll use it to give birth. Fair? After all, most of your arguments about how noble and divine National Slavery is based on the assumption that you'll never do it. When a guy suggests it, you slam it calling him a whiner. I hope I get a baby gal. Maybe she can get a scholarship and call guys whiners.<br><br>Anyway, if NS makes men out of boys, then how come so many gals are hailing FT (that have never been thru NS) as real men? Guys that have not gone thru NS are boys, not man at all, then where does that put FT? Childish quitters? Not according to gals.<br><br>At the end of the day, what results from this pointless and rethorical argument? Cognitive Dissonance.<br><br>Guys, you just have to go thru NS and act like its a good thing. Dun give feedback, dun give suggestions, dun try to improve things. Because if you do, you're a whiner.<br><br>Gals, go look for FT. The local guys are just a series of mindles drones, wasted 2 years learning irrelevant skills that has no real purpose. They will always be behind the FT by 2 years no matter how hard they try...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think many young lives took a downturn than upturn after NS.<br>Some even saw their child "murdered" by trainers and got puny compensation.<br><br>Why would any father/mother want his son/daughter stagnate, disciplined, whacked and screwed in NS for 2 long years when they can see them develop more intellectually elsewhere? Which is of far more greater importance to society: a military force of physical might or an economic force of great minds?<br>(Btw, is our military force of physical might that mighty?)<br><br>They won't admit it but I really think NS makes people silly. That explains why local girls don't go after "NSed" guys but foreign men. And top jobs go to FTs.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br></div>
