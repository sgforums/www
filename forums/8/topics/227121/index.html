            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, indeed the ingenius creators of the "Singapore seen" section have successfully transformed the nation of Singapore into a nation of Paparazzi. With such a section, typical Singaporeans like you and I can snap pictures quickly and conveniently at what we call inappropriate behaviour of other Singaporeans, then upload the pictures for other web-surfers to gawk at. WHERE'S OUR PRIVACY? But if the purpose was to curb bad behaviour in public, it would be impossible since we would have to be on our guard the whole time once we step over the thresholds of our door. It would be as if we had to hold our breaths and be so sharp as to avoid sinning in public places lest the self-righteous pull out their camera phones and snap pictures of us. LET ME ASK, ARE THE SELF-RIGHTEOUS THAT HOLY? EVERYONE HAS SINNED IN THEIR LIVES, EVEN THE BEST OF US. WE ARE MADE FOR SIN, AND SIN IN TURN WAS MADE FOR US. Uncomfortable, as you might put it. Being conscious of what you're doing the whole time, you never know who might betray your face to the press' website, even your best friend. Basic manners may be lacking in the character of some Singaporeans, but notice the background they come from, I mean what can you expect from the character of a man who has lived through gang fights and seen both his father and mother get slaughtered by robbers hungry for a mere $1? It would do people good if they would restrain their bloody cameras and sally forth to speak amicably with such a man, instead of picking the coward's way out and snapping a picture to spite him on the internet. In fact, why did were we pushed through oral exams? To inculcate the ability to speak of course. Most Singaporeans nowadays cannot so much as speak properly and firmly against what they believe against, especially to strangers who don't behave properly in public, and with the instigation of such a section in the straits times' website this disability has been encouraged tenfold. How would you like to be featured on the internet unconsciously but surely doing something you thought was right but in fact deemed wrong by most of Singapore's population? Like I've said before and I'll say it again, the judgement between good and evil is the difference between the majority and minority of the population who declare a certain deed good or bad. Also, with such embarrassment on the internet for potential employers to view, your income would have a better chance of becoming no-come. People who think like me have been flamed and blacklisted on the stomp website, so I'm appealing to an older but surely more matured society to CLOSE THE FUCKING WEBBIE! That's right, we're thinking of doing it like switzerland, dealing blows by signature superiority. Anyone support? Positively or negatively?[/url]</div>
