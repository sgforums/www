And yeah, you ARE going to freak out from the humidity, unless you're from georgia or florida I guess, be prepared for pimple outbreaks,<br><br>as for the food, I can only give this advice: Open Stomach, Open Mind .... and you'll find yourself in gastronomic paradise .... have fun ! ...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

If anyone ever needs anything, I live in San Diego !<br><br>-jason</div></blockquote>Welcome to Singapore!<br><br>First 2 weeks in Singapore: remember to bring along a hankie with you coz you will sweat buckets. After 2 weeks, you should be ok (i.e. normal like everyone else)<br><br>Not sure how long you need to get over jet lag but it took me 1 month to get over it. Do come to Singapore early to accustom yr body to the climate and time here.<br><br>Always look on the right side before the left before crossing the roads, unless you seek to be killed. We drive on the wrong side of the road (from your perspective).<br><br>NTU campus is far out at one corner of Singapore. Not every convenient to other places of Singapore. NTU Campus is more like Stanford (relatively new) but not as spacious, than say Boston University, MIT or Harvard (where architecture is ancient).<br><br>Classes at NTU depends very much on how enthusiatic students are. Unless your class size is small where you would get students participating, otherwise lecture is a total bore in a large class size!<br><br>But don't underestimate Asian students, they are real smart, alright!<br><br>There are only 3 local Universities in Singapore, NUS, NTU and SMU. NUS and NTU are more established, with a longer history. All in all, it's regarded highly by the locals. However, there's so many grads from NTU that it's not an unattainable university like IVY league ones in US. You judge.<br><br>You should explore the neighboring cities like Kuala Lumpur and also beach places like Langkawi and Tioman. Thailand is a good place for cheap buys.<br><br>Skip Bali, unless you seek to be bombed.<br><br>You need a jacket for class at NTU. In sunny Singapore where no one has the chance to wear winter clothings, lecture halls are the places where folks get to put on thicker clothings. The aircon is freezing at times.<br><br>Don't bother to bring cellphones or laptops to Singapore. You get the latest models ad cheaper here than in US.<br><br>Pack only Spring and Summer clothings. If you are big size, you will have a helluva time looking for clothes and shoes here. Note: it's Asian size, not American size.<br><br>Expect this place to be a little like Los Angeles, where you have high-rise buildings everywhere. Also, San Diego's pace of life is a little slow compared to Singapore. You need to adjust to that as well.<br><br>If you need more info, PM me. I've stayed in California, been to NTU and NUS and locally bred.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore is a fine city.<br><br>In Singapore we have fines for everything.<br><br>Singapore has a number of frowned-upon activities, and the sometimes Draconian methods of dealing with minor offences has caused both mirth and dread among visitors. The famous anti-long-hair campaign is a thing of the past, but it is only recently that long-haired men were turned away on arrival, or given a short-back-and-sides on the spot.<br><br>Singapore remains tough on a number of other minor issues, however, and the standard way of stamping out un-Singaporean activities is to slap a S$1000 fine on any offender. Actually, it is very rare that anybody gets fined that amount, but the severity of the fines is enough to ensure compliance.<br><br>Smoking in a public place - buses, lifts, cinemas, restaurants, air-conditioned shopping centres, and government offices - earns a S$500 fine. You can smoke at food stalls and on the street (as long as you dispose of your butt, of course). The move to ban smoking in private cars was eventually quashed because of the difficulty of enforcing it. A few years ago it was the fashion among Singapore subversives to urinate in elevators but a successful campaign of heavy fines and security cameras has stamped that one out.<br><br>Jaywalking is a relatively minor crime - walk across the road within 50m of a designated crossing and it could cost you S$50. There is a successful anti-littering campaign (with a fine of up to S$1000 for dropping even a cigarette butt on the street) and, not surprisingly, Singapore is amazingly clean.<br><br>The Mass Rapid Transit (MRT), Singapore's pride and joy, attracts some particularly heavy fines. Eating, drinking and smoking on the system are forbidden and attract a S$500 fine.<br><br>Gum chewing is also a frowned-upon activity in Singapore. Antisocial elements used to leave their gum deposits on the doors of the MRT, causing disruptions to the underground rail services. The sale, importation and even possession of chewing gum is now banned and subject to heavy fines.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
