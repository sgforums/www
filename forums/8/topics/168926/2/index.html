            <div class='col-md body'>Ok Singapore is a fine city for foreigners but a F U C K ing bad place for its own citizens. Enjoy your stay here as i am sure Singapore has stuff to offer that differs from what you americans have. Its not a really big city if you compare it by american cities, more choices of food instead of visiting subways and get used to the weather.  Oh one more thing if you plan to have  children here, especially a son, please don't get your son a citizenship here unless you want your son to condemn you for life. I don' think you will want your son to end up as a slave as they r going to be conscripted for 2 yrs when they reach 18, and bullying during conscription is common. I will leave you to figure out for more info. Even if you have a daughter with the tough laws and harsh living environment without welfare you might ask for her opinion if she wants to stay here.</div>

If you wanna challenge the best of the best, you will find it fierce.

Even the annual Great Singapore Sale pales when compared to seasonal sales in US.<br><br>Positive news; Chinese food is very cheap here compared to your Chinese takeaways. Living in Singapore, you need not have to cook at all. Just a US$2 can get full and satisfied on a hot meal in Singapore!<br><br>Bad news: Almost all food centres assume that everyone in Singapore takes chilli. Even at McDonalds &amp; Burger King (You have to ask for ketchup, otherwise you get chilli sauce to go with fries *Yucks!*). Portion of food is ridiculously small. Hence expect to lose weight easily in Singapore as most of your diet will  consist of more carbohydrate than protein.<br><br>Not much cheap buys in Singapore compared to the Asia region. Would sugg you travel to parts of Southeast Asia for cheaper buys. However, if you want expensive stuff, you can buy cars and apartments in Singapore. Cars in Singapore are &lt;10 yrs old and cost a lot of $$$ in comparison with the same model and make available in US.<br><br>Anyway, if you come to Singapore, you have to travel to the neighboring countries here to make your stay worthwhile. Singapore gets boring after a while.<br><br>Personally, I find clothes, bags and shoes are cheaper to get at Marshall, Kmart and those budget outlets in US than in Singapore. Home Depot offer cheap and good quality furniture compared to IKEA (&lt;--Cheap but quality sucks!).<br><br></span><br><br>Im excited to be immersed in singapore, singaporeans seem so friendly..<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Wait til you drive a car in Singapore or be a pedestrian on the road. haha.

            <div class='col-md body'>san diego eh? Well I went to their world famous zoo once, and guess what? It just reminded me of singapore's zoo. But of course u guys came up with the "open zoo" concept 1st, which we copied off and expanded on, so kudos to u.<br><br>basically on that trip I hit 3 states. Cali, Nevada n Arizona. think the city I liked best was San Fran. We flew into LAX but we never checked out LA itself. Ain't that a pity. The only other big city we properly visited during the trip was Vegas, hey hey.</div>
