Yes I am from america, I was born in San Diego, California, lived here for most of my life except for a stint in Japan ( Navy father ).  I even have the californian/ surfer accent. (TOTALLY BRAH)<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Hang out with the locals and your surfer's accent will be gone in no time.<br><br>You will learn an entirely new pidgin call 'Singlish', if you stay long enough in Singapore. Essentially, it's an efficient way of speaking English where you say only the crucial words e.g. noun, verb, place/time are used. Conjungations are dropped and grammar doesn't matter anymore. Your mind will use words with the shortest syllabus from a variety of languages (English, Mandarin, Hokkein, Cantonese, Teochew, Malay and sometimes Indian) to form your sentence.<br><br>Almost everyone in Singapore speaks this.<br><br>Major road names in Singapore are all 3 letters. Tune in to the radio in the morning or evening and you get DJs splurting out 3-letter word 'AYE, PIE, BKE, CTE, TPE etc to caution drivers and you get a good laugh that locals do comprehend the entire mish-mash of letters.<br><br>Singapore Boat Quay and Clarke Quay are like Gaslamp Quarters. If you like that kinda atmostphere, you can check the places out.<br><br></span><br><br>I'm not sure what you guys mean by clone, or if you think im for some reason faking that Im American ? Is it hard to believe that an american would want to go to singapore or am I missing something?<br><br><span style="color: blue;">We have lots of fun folks in this forums who like to impersonate themselves with a separate identity. Those identities that belongs to existing forumites are called 'clones'.</span><br><br>If it means that much to you guys, id be happy to prove I live in America lol.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Just a random thought, is there anything cool in America that you guys dont have that I should bring? Maybe as gifts, or just something i'll miss.  I hate sounding like a dumb-ass tourist, but hey, this is the best resource ive found yet!</strong><br><br><span style="color: blue;">I brought 4 fully packed-to-the-brim luggages home from US after months of shopping there. The only thing that I miss from California that I can't bring home is the weather! if you can bring that over, that would be awesome!<br>Otherwise, don't bother. What you have in US, we have it here.<br><br>One more thing: Most shops here do not have the 3 months return policy. Hence, anything that you buy, you cannot return without a damn good reason. (Reasons like 'you don't find the item suitable for your needs', 'the laptop is too slow') don't work,  Only big ones have a return policy but then again, most are about 7 days only.<br><br>If you are into body training, FYI, whey protein powder and protein pills are expensive here compared to US. Remember to buy more and bring it over if you need it. Use your dad's navy card and you can get discounts from stores in US.</span><br><br></blockquote></div>

You may get yrself banned from the forum.</span><br><br>Anyways, so what about stuff I should bring from America? Is anything here more expensive over in singapore ?<br><br><span style="color: blue;">In general everything in Singapore is cheaper. But don't expect quality. E.g. you can get cheap clothes here but you wear them out quickly.<br><br>Comparing clothes that you buy in US and Singapore, spending the same amount of money, you get slightly better quality clothes in US than in Singapore.<br><br>Note: US brands (anything) is always more expensive to get in Singapore than in US.<br><br>Of course, you have to take into consideration that Singapore offers Asian sizes of clothes and shoes. So you better be prepared to the limited choices due to size limitation.</span><br><br>Anyone have any tips for gettin used to the humidity? Does everyone in general stay inside, or is everyone just used to it. (For example in Las Vegas, even the locals arent used to the very dry hot weather, so they run from Ac to Ac)<br><br><span style="color: blue;">The most uninviting feeling is when you get out of Changi Airport and the warm air sticks to yr face instantly and you cannot get rid of it. Thereafter, you start perspiring. It gets scary to see water droplets forming on your arms and dripping off your face but you are not even doing anything strenous.<br><br>You will get used to the humidity in 1 week. Just 1 week of profuse sweating and then you will be fine! I've been through that!<br><br>If you stay in NTU, you practically do the Las Vegas way of running from LT to LT or to libraries to get cool air. Downtown Sg is better, you are always enclosed in Ac environment. At least you don't need a moisturiser all the time coz it's so humid here. But the sun will be scorching hot, esp in summer (May - July)</span><br>Is there any chance for an American staying for a while, to get a random job?  Or will I have to obtain a work visa?  Are there any CASH paid jobs in singapore? For example here I can work as a poker dealer for someone and get paid 100 bucks cash for the day, or a bartender who gets tips for his job.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Singapore is a 'fine' city with numerous rules and regulations. All systems are in place to weed out folks without working permit or employerment pass to work. Of course there are loopholes in all systems. Good for you if you can find work without proper authorization.<br><br>In fact, you can do anything in Singapore, but don't get caught! Singapore authorities are damn good at catching folks who break the law.<br><br>I got caught for jaywalking a minor road (as a pedestrian) a couple of weeks back at a suburban area of Singapore and was fined $20.<br>An aussie got death sentence by trafficking drugs into Singapore. An american got CANED for vandalising property years back.<br>So what do you think about working without proper authorization from the authorities?<br><br>Singapore is too small a place to hide anything. So good luck to you for the risk that you take!</span><br><br></div></blockquote></div>
