            <div class='col-md body'>to be honest, big companies do not care about losing a small fry customer like you. unless you spend $10000 on your internet bills, they don't give a f*ck.<br>seriously, you have customers going and customers coming. so they'll never be short of customers or afraid of losing them.<br><br>and if you tell them you've decided and is gon' switch to starhub at the end of the day; they'll be very happy to let you go. Less fuss, less grumblings, less complaints, less troubles. who the hell cares whether you end their contract  and hop over to starhub?<br><br>so i guess; those who threaten 'if you don't offer anything to me' or 'if you don't help me solve this problem', - i'm going to switch over to starhub or m1, are plain dumbf*cks. Threatening will not solve the issue, but anyway, they don't give a flying f*ck about what probs they have in their admin, billing, product system, etc. They just wanna make profit; but you're just a teeny-weeny mini bit fraction of that market pie.<br><br>SO WHO THE HELL CARES?!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ahhhh trendz, perhaps u should go study marketing n understand how significant a single customer might be n how retaining a loyal customer of 13 yrs is easier than having a new customer n how much the returns will be.<br><br>let me share wif u how i signed up wif singnet in 1995, it was thru word-of-mouth. 1 of my frens signed up for singnet n said it was gd, thus the rest of my frens n me went to sign up too n we found the service was not bad back then n further "advertise" for singnet unknowingly. the number of subscribers from my side is not juz 1 or 2 customers mind u. n i'm very sure my grp is not the only grp "advertising" for singnet.<br><br>from wat i understand abt singnet, they have a very gd marketing programme in attracting new customers but not that fantastic abt retaining old customers.<br><br>yup i agree wif qianer, how many $10k customer can u get?<br>the bulk of singnet subscribers r the typical u n me, paying $50+ or $60+ per mth for the broadband speed.</div>

Thus by word-of-mouth; there would be more customers coming up.<br><br>But come to think again, there will always be 'good'  and 'bad' customers.<br>and yeah - talk about Media Imperialism..<br><br>To use freebies to retain customers is an old-fashioned yet effective tactic.<br>To have credibility and reliability would also be the most upperhand tactic.<br>And to shed off one-time novelties; thus coming up with new and enhanced products would also be another tactic.<br><br>which would you adopt? which would customers fall for? the market is pretty much dominated by these two ISP/Telcos. And we're divided between them.<br><br>We would always have different people each complaininig, grumbling and whining about the products, after-sales service, etc - both from the 2 ISP  lynchpins. If the company were to look into every major or minor problems and grouses, would they even have time to manage the whole damn company?<br><br>picture this.<br>fancy a small-time customer askin' for the CEO of a company just because there isn't any loyalty rewards for him; do you think the CEO would even give a sh*t about him? Who the hell does the small-time piece of trash think he is? Is his monthly expenditure of a mere 50-60 bucks worth all the hassle of rewarding him with a $500 free gift?<br>So, how much is loyalty worth in this modern evolutionary corporate world?<br><br>And we would also have different and ever-changing demographics. Anyway,  half a slice of the pie doesn't mean you monopolise the whole damn market.<br><br>and as a chinese saying goes 'de chun jin chi' - i give you one inch, you want one foot. Now - spell GREED.<br><br>Lemme digress a lil'..<br><br>We consumers would never be satisfied. There's this insatiable appetite to get the most advantages for ourselves; and a perfectionist within ourselves that we expect things to go our way without any flaws. How ironic, considering how the real world works.<br><br></div>
