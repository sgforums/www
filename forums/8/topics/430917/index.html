              I wonder why people like you have such unrealistic expectations from the government, and because of you, my household has to pay in excess of $50000 in taxes every year to fund stupid subsidies and stuff for the low-income group who are ungrateful and complain time after time. Learn to live with what you have!
              
              1) $100,000 for a 4 room flat? Are you insane? The government is not obligated to give everyone ownership of a flat. For goodness sake, stop expecting to buy a house before 30 or something. Be realistic!
              
              2) You want cheaper medical services and shorter queues? Do you understand the laws of supply and demand? So what if it is expensive, you have Medisave, Medishield and Medifund. And people still dare complain about those 3 not being helpful when you can use it to pay up to 100% of your medical bills in some cases. Do you want to have NHS like in UK?!
              
              3) Limit for electricity bill? That will just encourage an unbridled wastage of electricity!
              
              4) HDB belongs to you... Err, your house resale value will go up to, mind you. You want a ERP-based lift, so that you can be charged fairly?
              
              5) That's the problem when each household owns more than 1 car. HDBs were designed to be affordable housing. If you can afford a car, why don't you stop exploiting government funds and taxpayers and stop taking advantage of the cheap HDB flats?
              
              6) No comment. You are just plain stupid. Everyone will just park wherever they like since they have different definitions of not blocking the road.
              
              7) Stop being so racist. Go for some skills upgrading which will make you more employable. Blame yourself for not having the right qualifications because you didn't work hard in school.
              
              8) Don't force us to give a damn about your stupid expectations and how you seem to live in poverty. FUCK YOU.
              
              9) Take away the incentive to boost the economy and the government will become inefficient.
              
              10) One man's trash is another man's treasure. What do you deem essential?
              
              11) Stop thinking about buying a flat at ridiculously low prices. Work harder and earn your rice bowl.
              
              12) Stop taking away prime land for private property.

              <p>2) With only 1 polyclinic per new town, it's unless we get more doctors. But tat said, we dun have enough doctors because NUS dun produce tat many doctors every year.</p>
              <p>3) Bill wise, I've switched to better light bulbs. It cost more but it last longer and consume lower electricity.</p>
              <p>4) Neither do I understand why must pay for lift.</p>
              <p>5) Neither is it govt's role to let ppl own cars seriously. Building MSCP would help, but there's a limit after all. More cars on the road = longer travelling time for bus commuters you get it?</p>

              <p>In the first place, we ourselves spoiled the market since it's by merit.</p>
              <p>10) I would love GST exempt, but you burden the small hold provision shops as they now have more work onto tabulating bills every night wat's non GST, wat's GST taxed.</p>
