Usually if you quit within the first month, only 24hours notice is needed.  No penalties unless its stated in your appointment letter. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

If you are really that determined to leave the company, managers would understand that it is pointless to keep you in your position for that one month. You would most probably be just wasting oxygen in the office premises.</div>

Saying 1300 and above makes you look incompetent in making decisions.

            <div class='col-md body'>In an interview, always say the truth. But there are many ways to say the truth. Instead of saying "My bloody boss keeps bullying me". You can say "It comes to a point where I could not agree and work anymore with the management." and then cite some good examples to back yourself up.</div>
