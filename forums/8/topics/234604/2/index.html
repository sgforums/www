            <div class='col-md body'>It is not in the fault of the advisors.<br><br>It is your own. It is normal that you have to do your research beforehand.<br><br>Maybe in the admin asst position you should be writing about finding a better working environment where you seek to get along with your colleagues and work together with them for the betterment of the company (I know it's a little superficial). True la admin kind of job is routine so you also must think if you are the type of person who can handle doing the same kind of stuffs everyday.</div>
