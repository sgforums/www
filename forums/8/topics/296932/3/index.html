            <div class='col-md body'>Just wanted to comment on how 'impatient' and 'rude' you make Ang-moh's out to be -<br>In my last summer holidays I worked here in a restaurant as a waiter, and without trying to make any sweeping generalisations, I noticed that the ang-mohs are the ones who will smile, be polite to you and thank you when ordering their food, when they receive their meals and the like. If anything takes longer to come than expected, they will sometimes ask what has happened to their food, but they will very usually understand the problems and accept it happily. Almost all my experiences serving them were pleasant, and I felt respected by them.<br>Whereas yes there were many local singaporeans who acted the same way, I did notice a more apparent lack in politeness and respect, they were far less likely to say 'thank you' or speak to you in a kind tone. If there was ever a problem, they were usually alot less understanding, and were alot more impatient. If they ever had an empty glass and I asked them if they would like another, some simply pointed at the empty glass and didnt say anything. Just small things like that, but it appeared quite rude to me.<br>Just wanna say that this should be taken with a pinch of salt, but it's just an experience which opened my eyes up a little to the differences here</div>
