But probably a majority don't to save money, because if im not wrong the longer your advert is the more money to publish in the newspaper?<br><br>Also what do you think of those company that advertise for accounting jobs then say when you call up "Sorry, FEMALE only".

            <div class='col-md body'>Speaking from an economic stance, Mandarin is deemed as more and more important in the world. This is, by and large owing to the fact that China is the world's fastest growing economy. Much of the world's trade is done with China and through China. Even MNCs and global conglomerates.<br><br>Like it or not, Mandarin is becoming a necessity. Many races, mixed or not, Chinese or not, have realized the economic necessity of learning and speaking Chinese. Even the caucasians themselves these days are learning Mandarin!<br><br>Admittedly, Mandarin is not my strength and my mandarin itself is hardly up to scratch, albeit at the conversational level. Yet it is important to realize that mandarin is crucial in today's society. Mandarin is not a difficult language to learn and it is my understanding that many community centres are offering Mandarin classes.<br><br>In order for us to remain marketable and current, we often have to ride on the waves of the commercial tide - which currently involves China a great deal. I wish you all the best in your job hunting stint but at the same time, would encourage you to pick up Mandarin - even if you do not like it.</div>

This is the first time i have done something as bold as this. This is my letter.<br><br>Dear editor,<br>I would like to refer to the article in the stright times, I would have to disagree with the writer. There have not been enough equal opportunities and priorities for the minority races recently. These problems were not that bad in my mother times as singapore was as a nation.<br>I am mixed race and only speak english all my life. I took malay in school but did not fare at it. I am very proud to be an english speaker as globally, this is the most important language.<br>Unfortunately, that does not seem to enough. The writer talks about not given equal opportunities to job and etc, but i know how it feels. I have not been able to find a stable job since i have graduated. I have even looked for help from the mp and many sources,<br>All to no avail. Majority of the jobs are seeking mandarin speakers.<br>I am aware that this topics has been brought up multiple amount of times, but i do not see any changes in this until today. Sadly, singapore's unemployment rate consists a very large number of the minority races. Many people are suffering the same thing as i am. It is not as if people in singapore cannot speak english! If this is true then how is singapore's economy ever going to come up?<br>Many times, i call a company and some even tell me rudely, 'No, we only want chinese!'. My mother had many conversations with her friends and some of them even personally know of many companies refusing to hire malay or indians, but they wouldn't mind hiring caucasians, and this is reality. We are born here, i do not understand why is this so, what have we done wrong? How could they do something like this to us? We are humans too, we need to survive and we are willing to work.<br>I think that these companies requiring for specific Candidates need to be educated. They need to know our plight and how important this problem is. I do not know if singapore is truly a racial harmony country as it seems. Is this about language or race?<br><br>I doubt this would ever get published but well.</div></blockquote>Welcome to the World.You finally came out of your cocoon.</div>
