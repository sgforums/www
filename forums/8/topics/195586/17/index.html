So that man can choose not to go to hell, but you have to believe Christ died on the cross for man's sins.<br><br>As I think some others have already mentioned, salvation is not achieved by deeds. Only belief in Christ will attain salvation.<br><br>But there is still consequences as to your actions while on this mortal world. You still have to answer to God for what good or what wrong you have done after death. The difference is that believers will not be condemned to hell forever.<br><br>Just to be clear with you, believing in christ doesn't mean you go unpunished, it just means you won't earn eternal damnation. You may think this is unfair, but that's your own perspective. I believe many of us have already explained the rationale behind it.<br><br>Punishment or reward for your acts on earth is not the same as whether you get to go heaven or hell.</div>
