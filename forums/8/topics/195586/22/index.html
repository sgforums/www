This is very dishonest.<br>...<br>4. If SIS is not misrepresenting the bible, then I dun know what is the meaning of misrepresenting liao. </div></blockquote>When a christian claims that their bible is a holy book. Critics then point to the contradictions and difficult to accept parts of it. When christians uses bible verses to say that their god is omni-benevolent, then critics point to the verses that says quite the opposite. When christians claim that the book is good and ultimate goodness, critics point to the parts that teaches stoning of people to death and rulings for slavery.<br><br>A christian choosing not to address these issues and still assert their claims, is likely to be dishonest. Surely you could see that these are asking christians to verify their claims and not making claims about their religion.<br><br>So.. what is wrong with critics trying to deconvert you?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by laoda99:</div><div class="quote_body">2.

Of coz Christians must claim it becoz the bible is our book wat!!!</div></blockquote>You missed my point entirely. There is no doubt that the bible is Christianity's book. The point was on Chrisitians claiming it to be word of god. By what process you, as a mortal, determine any book to be divine in nature? Using what checks, can we verify or falsify your process? What makes your interpretation of a book, to be superior to that of another fellow mortal? If you say a relationship with god makes you superior and still not see it as morally high grounded arrogance, then nothing more i say can help you.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by laoda99:</div><div class="quote_body">3.

Islam? I seriously believe that it might be due to that muslims do not approach me to evangelise their religion (for whatever reasons, though i suspect its due to my color). But christians do. As such i have read only the bible and do not know much of anything outside Christianity.

God does not want to condemn mankind to hell forever. Hence the reason why Jesus Christ had to die on the cross. So that there may be a way that man can go to heaven still. It's not so much that God created hell specifically to throw man into, it's more of God letting have man choose a way out.<br><br>I'm not asking you to believe me that there is heaven and hell. Neither am I asking you right now to believe like me that Jesus is the son of God. I just want to give you the perspective on salvation. </div></blockquote>God might not <strong>want</strong> to condemn mankind to hell forever. But he is going to. And given the attribute of omniscience ascribed to him, i find it difficult to believe that God is benevolent at all.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SumOne:</div><div class="quote_body">I'm quite glad you haven't taken my analogy out of context and that it was meant to address something else.

Imagine a world where there is only rocks (sorry i did not make references here). Would one rock be more moral than another rock? No.. for there's no need for morality in a world of only rocks.<br><br>It is us humans, who understand suffering, and do not wish anyone to suffer that we develop morality. Why should, any religion, positing any god, be free from moral judgements (made by humans). Imagine a cult where it teaches killing people as moral. Won't it be terrible if religion were automatically discounted to be free from moral judgement? How do we determine the said cult to be a cult? What if the cultists say that killing is part of their divine morals enshrined in some book and no one has the right to morally judge them without being seditious?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SumOne:</div><div class="quote_body">You can call it an assumption but I know things are not as simple as it seems.

I really cannot say to you who should die, who shouldn't, because that's really not up to me, whether or not I believe in God.<br><br>Refer above, I can't comment because divine punishment is not something I want to comment is right or wrong. </div></blockquote>I guess that would be the difference between you and me. Even if God exists, and his punishment is divine, i would humanely judge the punishment and not call it moral. Please do not think of this as some sort of mortal arrogance, but as i've said, human morals makes sense only to humans. A spiritual being would have no need for human morals.</div>

What i said was <strong>a</strong> christian who asserts the characteristics of his/her god of his/her own religion, but deliberately <strong>omits to explore the difficult issues</strong> is dishonest. To choose to drop my qualifier is your own words.<br><br>I'm not sure why, though, you would consider that a person asserting a god as benevolent and accept nothing else is not one-sided.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by laoda99:<br>2.

I responded by explaining where and how my interests developed. I'm not sure why you feel that i've been talking about those issues here or why you would assume that i assume anything if at all about any or all christians.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by laoda99:<br>4.
