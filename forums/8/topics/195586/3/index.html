I am just telling of my experience. I am not even selling you Jesus bacause I am not asking you to believe in Jesus in the traditional Christian sense... that is, put you faith in Him. I am just telling you that I understand what Jesus was proclaiming becuase I had similar experiences of what He said.<br><br>As far as I am concern Jesus was pointing mankind to something, Jesus was the finger. You follow the finger and see what the finger was pointing at and then decide if that is where you want to go, for example. That is what you wanted to see, for example.<br><br>You can of course follow the finger and then say, no that is not what I want and no, that is not where I want to go.<br><br>As far as I am concerned, I followed in Jesus' direction and to use crude terminology, hit the jackpot.</div>
