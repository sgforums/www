            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>So loving parents don't punish their children? </blockquote>Loving parents will show more love and don't punish their children excessively. Even if they punish u, their intention is to make u become better and the punishment never crippled or permanently hinder u in your life.

Is the law in the OT tat states its believer should kill believer of other god moral ? Is the crusaders different from the holocaust ? I think the comparison is fine. If tis form of killing is your terminology of moral, then nazis r moral too. Nazis set basic rules and laws for men as well<br><br><blockquote>Motive for God to do what? How deeply job love God?

I don't find it tat way. They know wat is the training for, they know why they conduct certain excercice and the overall strategy. But of course u never went to the military so u have a wrong impression of the soldier in general (If I am not wrong u r a girl and do not go to NS) I do not know wat do u mean by "bang bang bang" but if u r talking about universal rounds, it is a means to conserve bullets, safety since bullets may accidentally kill someone, safety for society (because people can have more venues to steal bullets) and achieve the effect of training (there r many training tat require bullets).<br><br>However for god, they don't see the broad picture, they just memorise everything and assume tat it is god without looking at both side of the fence.

            <div class='col-md body'>Icemoon,<br><br>Atheism is the lack of beliefs in any gods. It doesn't take much to be an atheist. Given that, an atheist can have any number of beliefs. Some of them, much like theists, let their beliefs take control of their lives. Saying a person is an atheist, says nothing about his/her beliefs. It only indicates his/her lack of belief in any gods. As such, asking what asking what an atheist base their beliefs on doesn't make much sense. Each and every human being has their own individual beliefs.<br><br>In fact, atheism exists only because theism exists. You (pardon me for assuming that you're theist) and i are pretty much the same.

Take note that finding humor in "thinking about why there is suffering and evil in life" is very different from finding humor in "suffering of people". One is pretty much a philosphical thing the latter is pretty much malicious.<br><br>If someone comes up to me and tells me that his god is omniscient (knows everything), which means this god knows that evidence supporting his evidence is not adequate for <strong>me</strong> to start believing. And said person claims his god gives me freewill and that i will go to his god's hell because i am arrogant/angry/afraid/know-deep-down-but-in-denial, and then claims that his god is omnibenevolent (not just benevolent but omnibenevolent), all the while said god does not give me more hard irrefutable evidence of his/her/its existence...<br><br>All these, the WHOLE paradox, i find candid. And because i find it funny, i present the paradox to the said someone candidly. The whole point to note is <strong>i am humoured by it, not in bitterness</strong>.<br><br>Did i miss anything?</div>
