One cannot harbor anger at something which one does not believe to exist. If he was angry with some spiritual entity, then he would be somewhat already believing in the entity.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by laoda99:<br>hmm......if already u dun believe in god, dun blame god for letting us kill ourselves....</blockquote>As i've said, one cannot blame or be angry with something that one does not believe to exist. The "<span style="font-style: italic;">why God gave me free will knowing i would make the wrong choice</span>" paradox is not for me but for you to ponder over. To ponder over things which your religion teaches you <span style="font-style: italic;">not to question</span>. If pondering through, you end up becoming atheist/agnostic, then i congratulate you. On the other end, if pondering makes you stronger in your religion, then i congratulate you all the same. The purpose is to hope that people will not be blind in faith.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by laoda99:<br>yeah...and to create nuclear weapons tat can wipe us off the planet....</blockquote>While nuclear power can be used as weapons, nuclear power can also be used as an alternative energy source to replace our depleting fuel. Nuclear weapons are not a result of intellect/technology being evil, but a result of the failing of men. Nuclear power, like a sword, like fire, like the piece of rock on the ground, is neither inherently good nor inherently evil.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by xXStormFallXx:<br>Core NDE experiencers, in particular, tend to be convinced of the reality of the experience as an intimation of the afterlife. This includes those with agnostic/atheist inclinations before the experience. Many former atheists, such as the The Rev. Howard Storm (Rodrigues, 2004) [2] have adopted a more spiritual view of life after their NDEs.</blockquote>Personal experiences, because they are personal, cannot be used as evidence to support the existence of anything. Personal experience cannot be falsified, verified or replicated. There are plenty of people who nearly die but never did experience any NDE. People afflicted with Schizophrenia have very realistic personal experience too.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by xXStormFallXx:<br>Like I have stressed in my previous posts, I am not talking about abandoning intelligence totally. You can have intelligence or not (everybody has some level of intelligence) but what really matters is how you use that intelligence. Which is where morality and choice comes into the question. and religion provides you with a set of moral codes. you need to have faith in love, a right faith in God to know you are doing things the right way in life, in a way that benefits yourself and humanity.</blockquote>Quite a number of theists assert that morality comes from their religion. I'll use an example to note that this is not neccessarily the case. I'll assume most of us on this topic are pretty well acquainted with Christianity as such i'll use the bible as example.<br><br>The bible is a good and holy book, as suggested by Christians. It provides us with the 10 commandments (in an abstract form) which talks about some basic good morals, like one should not murder. However, the bible provides alot more. The 10 commandments are just a few quotes in it. The bible also provides explicit instructions on when to stone certain people to death. It also contains explicit instructions on how to trade with slaves.<br><br>All these, we realise are no longer acceptable as social norms in our society. Instead, Christians gloss over them and pick selective quotes from the bible and use as the 10 commandments. Here, we see morality evolving independently of religion or the bible. If morality cannot be produced outside of religious scriptures, then today, you and i could well be slaves. And i would have been stoned to death 100 times over.</div>

Sixsentinels have also agreed that men is imperfect. I agree with the two of u. It is becoz of this we need Christ, and not becoz we are perfect.</div>
