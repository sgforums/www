Only experience proves the truth. Not intellectual arguments no matter how logical.<br><br>Religious people have had such experiences.

His separation from Christianity began when he started to view his religion as a chore and as a duty. He also gained an interest in the occult as his studies expanded as to include such topics. Lewis quoted Lucretius as having one of the strongest arguments for atheism:<br><br>Nequaquam nobis divinitus esse paratam<br>Naturam rerum; tanta stat praedita culpa<br>Had God designed the world, it would not be<br>A world so frail and faulty as we see.<br><br>When he later wrote an account of his<span style="color: red;"> adult reconversion to Christianity, </span>under the title Surprised by Joy, he said that he had been "very angry with God for not existing". Some interpret this to mean that he did not so much reject the existence of God as harbour anger at God for the unfairnesses in life. This interpretation appears to be contradicted by a letter to a friend, in which he said: "all religions, no, mythologies to give them their proper name, have no proof whatsoever!" Later in his life, however, he began to believe in a deeper experience of some fundamentals of Western thought.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Influenced by arguments with his Oxford colleague and Roman Catholic friend J. R. R. Tolkien, and by G.K. Chesterton's book, The Everlasting Man, he slowly rediscovered Christianity. In 1929, he came to believe in the existence of God although he fought greatly against it. He describes his last struggle in Surprised by Joy:</span><br><br>"You must picture me alone in that room in Magdalen, night after night, feeling, whenever my mind lifted even for a second from my work, the steady, unrelenting approach of Him whom I so earnestly desired not to meet. That which I greatly feared had at last come upon me. In the Trinity Term of 1929 I gave in, and admitted that God was God, and knelt and prayed: perhaps, <span style="color: orange;">that night, the most dejected and reluctant convert in all England." </span>In 1931, after a lengthy discussion with Tolkien and another close friend, Hugo Dyson, <span style="color: indigo;">he reconverted to Christianity and (to the regret of Tolkien) joined the Church of England. He noted, "I came into Christianity kicking and screaming."</span><br><br><span style="color: brown;">Although an Anglican, Lewis' Catholic leanings appeared to influence his beliefs; he accepted the Catholic doctrine of mortal sin, implying that he believed a Christian could lose their salvation, a belief somewhat at odds with reformed views on justification. </span>This opinion was thoroughly explored in Lewis' book The Screwtape Letters. (disputed Â— see talk page) Lewis also accepted the Catholic doctrine of Purgatory.</strong></div>

You can choose it based on your experiences and understanding and what has worked for you, dont' you agree? Example if you were a Christian from birth, if it works for you, then what is wrong in having faith and following it? And I'm not saying following it blindly - you know it is true when it something you can rely on to give you a direction that gives you rewards. if you find something is not acceptable, you convert.<br><br>You said none of the choices made is right since it 'contradicts' one another. I disagree - the main idea of a religion, no matter what religion, is that there is a higher being worthy of your respect. You have faith in this being and you pray. You adopt a way to life your life based on the teachings of this being, and the essential teaching are about humility, love, goodwill, abstinence from sin. IT's not that different.
