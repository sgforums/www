Christians can be murderers, rapers, drug pushers and commit all sort of authrocities and yet can get to heaven. People who can become mother teresa and help out in poor countries throughout their lives get to go to hell. As said, hell is not for sinners, but non-believers. Sinning is not the real reason why people go to hell because it is insignificant to the outcome. But of course u will totally act dumb again and repeat the same old points again. I again put it in point form for u<br><br>1. According to your reply above, u say tat with faith in christ u 100% guarantee to go to heaven<br>2. Again according to your reply above, u say tat without faith in christ u 100% go to hell<br>3.

            <div class='col-md body'>finishing up some loose ends<br><br><blockquote>As explained in the foregoing, science up to this date can only prove certain limited physical laws not the whole physical existence. Even Darwin and Stephen Hawking would not be up to the task of proving existence or non-existence of God. After black hole, it is quite doubtful anyone can explain anything what would become of the universe.<br><br>God is the only rational explanation of the creation of the immense universe. His existence cannot be proven by anyone. Yet he is pervasive in history. Many people tend to call his revelations to many prophets and the power he has shown as superstitutions but I think not all the prophets are liars. We should look at the substantive parts of the revelations and not try to nickpict on certain Christians' wrongfulness as reason for our disbelief. How do we explain the rationale of God's totality of teachings to mankind and his predictions through prophets coming true today. </blockquote>I agree with your first para, however the second para is really just a thinking. Why do u say tat god must be the end tat produce the black hole etc ? Wat u r saying is the same as wat the people of the old say tat lightning is produce from the lightning god. If u believe in a cause for everything, another logical question to ask is wat produce god. If your answer is nothing produce god (which is obviously much more complicated than universe and obviously made itr harder to believe it create out of nothing), then I can easily say tat since u believe in nothing create out of something, we can just simply say the black hole is also produce nothing out of something.<br><br><blockquote>The perspective is (1) the universe is extremely complex yet logical (2) could the universe including life and intelligence have been created by itself or by some omnipotent power we call God. </blockquote>My belief is , the universe is created by itself.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  As stated earlier, it is just like people saying who create air is the air god, who create earth is the earth god and who create the sun is the sun god. It is really just ignorant thinking due to lack of knowledge  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> <strong>The only reason why u believe god is the creator is really just because the story made sense to u</strong>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> There is no evidence, no nothing and u just say it is created by god simply because u like the story of god more. The reason why ancient chinese believe pang gu made the world, nuwa made the men, why zeus came about and many other old stories is the same as who u come about your conclusion. Tis is really also the reason why archimedes say tat the heavier the object the faster it drops. There r a few hundred story tat made sense too (from other religion). Buddhist believe tat the universe is an endless cycle and hence no need a creator. Why not believe in tis one ? Why do u believe in your particular story ?<br><br>I think the rest of your thread is really about the same thing<br><br><blockquote>My example is sufficient for u. If you keep putting words into my mouth, I am going to ignore u. I am not going to say u are dumb even if appear to be. </blockquote>Aiyah.. u have no answer to the things I say. If u say tat I am putting words in your mouht, then REBUKE my points. Otheriwse I felt tat only cruel people believe tat handicaped people desreve the state they r in as it is is earthly consequences for their sins and such peopel should be ignored<br><br><blockquote> I see it the other way from u. No matter how bad u have erred, but if u repent in the last min, u will still be saved. If murderers can be saved by Christ, so why can't u? </blockquote>Obviously since u already believe your god to be unfair, letting perhaps the hundred of victims who r killed by tis murderer to die horrendously die without justice met will be perfectly ok for u. Furthermore the victim can be a non-beleievr and they go to hell while the person who kill them go to heaven. Tis seems absurb to other normal people but to christians, it is perfectly ok. Tat is why people resent christanity and felt tat it is unbelievable.<br><br><blockquote>Hell is definitely for sinners, and the so-called "Christians" u said doing all sorts of bad things and still expected to be saved, becoz these evildoers will be turned away by God as said in the gospel of Matthew. I do not need to quote u the verse again becoz we have told u many times in EH, but u chose to ignore. </blockquote>Again u have failed to rebuke my points and just talk about the same thing without answering my enquiries. Furthermore u r really contradicting yourself from your first part of reply and second part. Hitler have faith in christ and interprete tat the deeds he do is for christ. So he goes to heaven since his faith in jesus is true while the jews, who do not believe in christ goes to hell. Tat is real nice.<br><br><blockquote> I have said it in my previous posts.It is ur own choice really. God is not going to force u to believe in him</blockquote>I can say he already resort to the worst method of threathen and since IMO he doesn't exists, tat is the most the church can do.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>I agree with your first para, however the second para is really just a thinking. Why do u say tat god must be the end tat produce the black hole etc ? Wat u r saying is the same as wat the people of the old say tat lightning is produce from the lightning god. If u believe in a cause for everything, another logical question to ask is wat produce god. If your answer is nothing produce god (which is obviously much more complicated than universe and obviously made itr harder to believe it create out of nothing), then I can easily say tat since u believe in nothing create out of something, we can just simply say the black hole is also produce nothing out of something.</blockquote>My explanations in my previous posts about existence of god were based on rationality and logic. My rationality is briefly this: there is a causation in this universe: nothing came nothing and if there is something, it is caused by something.<br><br>If there is no causation, then I don't think we can even begin to want to know about anything or argue about anything. We will not need any intelligence or desire and do not care god or we human being or intelligence exist or not.<br><br>If we simply follow your trend of thought, that there is a mother nature, lightning is created by nature and there is no causation of universe, ligntning gods and black holes then we need not ask whether there is god or what made us human beings.<br><br>You see then we will not need to deal with causation at all like whether god has caused us in the same way as you have dismissed causation about lightning, nature and black holes. What is even least important to know according to your "mother nature" theory is that what happen after black holes and whether after black holes there exist any physical laws as we know them at all is not at all important to know.<br><br>We can just accept your assumption that there is no causation and if anything exist in this world like human being, god or blackholes, they just happened or were strewn about on this earth by some accidents or natural phenomena.<br><br>Then we can rest back and say life takes place in a cycle and the cycle will take care of life and we don't care what caused lives and who created us.<br><br>There will be no need for desire too for knowledge as there is no need not to know about anything or how they were caused. The final conclusion according to such "mother nature" theory will be "just do good and hope for the best"<br><br>So can you see where your "mother nature", "heavenly circle" or other agnostic thinking will lead us to if we do not start rationalising about god and god's revelations and try to get the message for our own good.<br><br></div>

In fact, if life were all lovely dovely, not only would life be meaningless, people will very much take God for granted. There has to be sin and bad things in this world so that the good has meaning. This is mentioned in the bible by the way. The bible also does say, it doesn't mean we should encourage sin or evil to contrast with good even more. But rather, we should always aim to use good to overcome sin and that is a never ending task.<br><br><blockquote>Obviously since u already believe your god to be unfair, letting perhaps the hundred of victims who r killed by tis murderer to die horrendously die without justice met will be perfectly ok for u.

A guy on a death sentence will still get executed when he choose to become a christian. But what you say about the victims going to hell is quite true.<br><br>But to add, it's not about how you die, but rather, when you die if you're a believer or not. You might think it's unfair but I want to clarify something about the whole believing in God thing. To be precise, you have to believe that Jesus Christ died on the cross. Jesus Christ died on the cross for man's sins, so it's only fair that people have to believe in him and accept that he died for you. I'm not asking you to believe me now, but I'm just trying to explain the rationale. Unlike Buddhist thinking, Salvation is not decided by how much good deeds you do, this is mentioned in the bible as well.<br><br>In fact, to be honest with you, I can't tell you for sure who really goes to heaven and who goes to hell. Because ultimately, salvation is decided by God, and not man. But you do have to believe in Christ and what he did. And personally, I believe if you are a true believer of Christ, you won't be like Hitler killing people or some cultist leader who twists the original teachings of the bible. If you were a true believer in God and Christ, you wouldn't do things that would make him sad.<br><br>Just like how I don't believe Islam is about raging war on America and its allies. But unlike Christianity, Islam does not believe in Jesus Christ as the son of God.<br><br>[quote]I can say he already resort to the worst method of threathen and since IMO he doesn't exists, tat is the most the church can do. [quote]<br><br>I'm not sure about your personal encounters, but I'm very sure not all Christians threaten. But I just hope you can understand that this is a belief, just as how each religion will have its own fundamental beliefs. We can't lie to you any way around it. I'm not asking you to believe, just to understand where we're coming from.<br><br>I'm very sorry if you've met nothing but people threatening you to believe, but I can tell you honestly that God does get people to believe in more loving ways. Whether it would happen for you I can't say. I'm not God anyway, so I wouldn't know his plans for you or anybody else.</div>
