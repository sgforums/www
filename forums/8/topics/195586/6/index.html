This is why intellect is fallible - because it depends on the way you use your intellect. With your intelligence you can choose how to intepret his teachings. You see the differents between fundamentalists and true believers of religion. Terrorists have the wrong idea of their religion -  they are relying on their (faulty) intellect to intepret their religion in a way that is destructive to mankind. Don't you agree. Right faith in God means intepreting your religion rightly. If you have the right faith only then will you be able to truly reach God.</div></blockquote>o.o god gives us intelligence and we dun use it? well done again, jesus. the main reason we are born with logic and intelligence is to enable us to think logically and intelligently that god doesnt exist.</div>

You can choose it based on your experiences and understanding and what has worked for you, dont' you agree? Example if you were a Christian from birth, if it works for you, then what is wrong in having faith and following it?</blockquote>Those who r borned into a religion and never check about the other religion can't really say tat it is "right". It is "right" for other people of other religion when they r borned into it as well but surely not all of them r right. It is the same as someone who has never been see/hear/ go out of singapore to say tat East Coast is the biggest beach in the world<br><br><blockquote>You said none of the choices made is right since it 'contradicts' one another. I disagree - the main idea of a religion, no matter what religion, is that there is a higher being worthy of your respect. You have faith in this being and you pray. You adopt a way to life your life based on the teachings of this being, and the essential teaching are about humility, love, goodwill, abstinence from sin. IT's not that different. It's a matter of how you adopt these beliefs, the way you carry them out.</blockquote>In tat case since every religion is the same then why don't we see christians becoming muslims and fast or buddhist to walk over charcoals during thaipusam ? Religion is like a history book. It try to convince people of it knows wat is happening past/present/future.
