            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by skyfoo:</div><div class="quote_body">as i mentioned before, it's u christians need evidence to back your insistence of god existance. u christians just love to claim god exists, prove he's not. it's so dumb right? claiming the existance of sth and ask ppls to prove u wrong. and most of ur arguments? bible proves god existance, god is always there, no arguments are needed, u need faith to see god. u are telling me that's concrete evidences? that's naive and low intelligent answers i would say. u christians just cant back ur claim of god existance and just find ways and ways to divert away from the issue and instead shooting us back like u did. for me, i dun use evolution or some complex science to challenge the religion. i basically use logic and common sense. basic thinking and logic just tell u god dun exist. if u christians want us atheists to believe in god. simple. prove god existance. or tell us what faith is and how it will lead us to god. if i see god, i'll definitely believe in him. the problem is, i dun see god. oh ya, he's invisible right?</div></blockquote>I will not attempt to make you believe, because your heart and mind is already hardened. I don't think it was ever anyone's intention to convert you anyway.<br><br>But I will just say one thing, God is not at your beck and call. He will not appear to you just to prove that he exists. God is not something or someone that you summon to and from whenever you want.<br><br>My point to you now is not to ask you to believe or not, because different people will have different beliefs. My only request is you don't make personal attacks just because of that. What difference are such personal attacks from racism?<br><br>An experience with God is not just about seeing him or anything like that. Older Christians can tell you that. The God Christians rightfully believe in isn't just about pretty miracles and someone who will always give you toys and money. I believe you've only been exposed to the certain doctrine of one particular church.<br><br>That are some things that science or human logic can't teach you. Why is it that some people take drugs? Why do people kill? It is never logical to kill, yet some people do it in anger. I think I replied something to you in another thread too, there are many things too that science is not able to explain either, so science is not perfect. And if anything, it is based on assumption of theories as well. Human character and human behaviour are about emotions as well.<br><br>I'm not saying absolutely for sure all scientists are wrong, there are christian scientists anyway. Science is basically a study by man of nature anyway. It's just how man attempts to understand the things around him. And nothing happens contrary to nature, only man's understanding of it.<br><br>Having said so much, my main point is the way you expect to see God isn't how Christians view God (or at least how Christians should). God isn't simply a single entity that you can embody and put in a location like an object.</div>
