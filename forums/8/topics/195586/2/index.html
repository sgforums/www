But you cannot discount that 2000-3000 years ago, some people also called out to GOD and wrote it down in a book about what their experience was like. For people now to simply read about and believe those people's experiences is useless. People now need to have their own experiences with GOD.</div>

I'm curious...<br>Anyway, people have the right to choose to believe what they want to believe.<br>Everyone has their own perception of God... maybe there <span style="font-style: italic;">is</span> a universal Creator of the universe, who knows... but you can't say all religions are nothing more than assumptions. There is some element of truth in all religions. People have had what they call spiritual experiences (ie "glimpses of God" ) with regards to their own religion around the world. Religion is, simply put, a set of morals/values that helps a person acheive greater peace and happiness. It's not just some assumption about a non-existent God. Religion is a source of faith and enhances their lives. It gives people direction. If you're an atheist, fine. You are free to choose your beliefs.<br><br>But I do agree that the real God does not reveal himself until the person has proven themselves capable and ready - not necessarily intellectually (ie answering all the questions of the universe) but spiritually enlightened. Not all religious people may meet God, but at least they won't end up in a place like Hell.</div>

The reason why we do not believe God exists is because no other species we know of has reached Ascension (when a species acquires ALL knowledge that exists) yet. When a species (or a collective) reaches Ascension, THAT species becomes God itself, because since God is Nature and that species, upon Ascension would've the knowledge to manipulate Nature, then that species sees the workings of the Universe and understands how it functions, and can then have the power to CREATE Universes of its own.</div>
