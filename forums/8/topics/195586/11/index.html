It is really not practising wat is preached. Even human have the wisdom to be impartial and punish people based on their wrongdoings instead of punishing people just because u do not like him </blockquote>When we discuss this topic about Christianity, we should not discuss Christians' teachings. We should discuss God's teaching as revealed to men. Do not discuss what a few Christians' views about Christ or God as the Christians' views or interpretations about god might not be correct. It is the source of christianity and Christians' teaching about God's existence that we should refer to in any reasonable discussions about Christianity or God's teaching. if Christians are wrong in conveying all those messages of god and god's laws and commands and punishments for sin, there are not point to argue with them. There are good Christians and there are bad christians. All Christians will be judged by God's laws and if any of them are hypocritical saying one thing and acting another then they might not be saved.<br><br><blockquote>If u ask me it is more harder to believe god is created since it is suppose to be more complex than the universe. The universe is logical and tat makes it more believable why it is created by nature. Why add something to make it become illogical ? </blockquote>The physical world and the universe cannot be fully explained by science up to this date. Many scientific theories have been around for some years but one by one they have been revised. Lately, the Darwin's theory of Evolution is being challenged by "Irreducible Complexity" theory which is unfolding to scientists currently. Stephen Hawking's explanations of the universe indicated that when substances collapsed by great weight of gravity into black holes as seen of big stars collapsing in the past ages into one point, the universe could no longer obey physical laws beyond that point called black hole. Stephen Hawking will be telecast this Sunday (18.6.2006) on channel News Asia.<br><br>So under such circumstances as science is unable to fully explain everything in this planet nor the outer bigger universe nor about life and creation, the only rational way for we human being to conclude is not to ignore the possibility of existence of God and creation of the immensely complex universe by an omnipotent almighty we generally call God.<br><br><blockquote>Personally I believe the direct opposite. In the bible god has shown himself to kill many people and is extremely cruel to any opposition even if they r mere children. And worse still many of the teaching goes against conventional scientific studies. On teaching good things, it is manily to do with politics as those tat teaches bad things will be labelled as cults and get eliminated </blockquote>God has portrayed himself in the bible as a powerful being who wanted people to believe him as the just and only god who has created this world and has taught his believers to do good and obey his commandments. In that context, he has also shown in power throughout the revelations of his wraths against people who sinned, oppressed, and practised evil. In that context, God has annihilated sinners including those who worshipped idols, golden carving of images and those who practised evil deeds. Right or wrong in terms of ethical or moral values as human beings know them, God has shown he was powerful and he was capable of destroying sinners and evil-doers.<br><br>For as long as we human beings do not intend to practise evils or sins against mankind and others or disobedience of god's laws and are willing to have faith in him and practise his teaching, I think there is nothing to worry about. We are not perfect. But he has sent his only begotten son to die for us on the cross to cleanse our sins and made it possible for us to be saved by repentence. This revelation (right or wrong, true or not can be argued no doubt) shows god's nature - he is a compassionate god. Therefore we can conclude that God works by faith. This faith aspect may or may not be fair according to human being's moral or ethical standard, but God has consistently tried to reach out to those who do not know him through evangelism to give them an equal chance. All we know is that he is trying to give human beings an equal chance to know him and practise his teachings and commandments and be saved through faith.<br><br><blockquote>The burden of proving christ has resurrected lies on the people who believes in it. However there r certain contradictions to his resurrection such as who is the first to witness him as well as a claim tat the many dead people start to walk on the street when he died. These dead people r suppose to be walking on the streets and shouting jesus is lord etc. If tat happens I am sure it is recorded in history but strangely no mention of such a strong miracle get recorded </blockquote>As explained in the foregoing, science up to this date can only prove certain limited physical laws not the whole physical existence. Even Darwin and Stephen Hawking would not be up to the task of proving existence or non-existence of God. After black hole, it is quite doubtful anyone can explain anything what would become of the universe.<br><br>God is the only rational explanation of the creation of the immense universe. His existence cannot be proven by anyone. Yet he is pervasive in history. Many people tend to call his revelations to many prophets and the power he has shown as superstitutions but I think not all the prophets are liars. We should look at the substantive parts of the revelations and not try to nickpict on certain Christians' wrongfulness as reason for our disbelief. How do we explain the rationale of God's totality of teachings to mankind and his predictions through prophets coming true today.<br><br>(To continue..)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hahahaha you should simply ask. Find out what heaven and what hell is. You are just as bad as the christians who go around preaching when they have no experience of heaven and hell; if you only complain and condemn. Yes you can experience heaven and hell, right here on earth.<br><br>You must find out for yourself and that is by asking, not by condemning.<br><br>I like Buddhists because Buddha asked them to find it out for themselves... so they are always curious and finding out for themselves. Some Buddhists unfortunately do not take Buddha's words at face value. Just like some Christians do not take Jesus's words at face value. They simply imagine and have faith in their own imagination; and have the cheek to call themselves disciples of Jesus.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>When we discuss this topic about Christianity, we should not discuss Christians' teachings. We should discuss God's teaching as revealed to men. Do not discuss what a few Christians' views about Christ or God as the Christians' views or interpretations about god might not be correct. It is the source of christianity and Christians' teaching about God's existence that we should refer to in any reasonable discussions about Christianity or God's teaching. if Christians are wrong in conveying all those messages of god and god's laws and commands and punishments for sin, there are not point to argue with them. There are good Christians and there are bad christians. All Christians will be judged by God's laws and if any of them are hypocritical saying one thing and acting another then they might not be saved. </blockquote>Tat bring to the question which teachings are right and which are wrong. So far the things I have said r the church's stand. If they r wrong in conveying the mesage then wat is right ?<br><br><blockquote>The physical world and the universe cannot be fully explained by science up to this date. Many scientific theories have been around for some years but one by one they have been revised. Lately, the Darwin's theory of Evolution is being challenged by "Irreducible Complexity" theory which is unfolding to scientists currently. Stephen Hawking's explanations of the universe indicated that when substances collapsed by great weight of gravity into black holes as seen of big stars collapsing in the past ages into one point, the universe could no longer obey physical laws beyond that point called black hole. Stephen Hawking will be telecast this Sunday (18.6.2006) on channel News Asia.<br><br>So under such circumstances as science is unable to fully explain everything in this planet nor the outer bigger universe nor about life and creation, the only rational way for we human being to conclude is not to ignore the possibility of existence of God and creation of the immensely complex universe by an omnipotent almighty we generally call God. </blockquote>I don't see the link why evolving science knowledge shows tat there is a god.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">In the past men is worse still and don't even know wat is thunder. Just because men do not know everything doesn't mean god must exists. They r independent events. However u got to admit tat science has reach a level of muturity tat it can be generally trusted. Otherwise why will peope have the computer and certain phenomenon has been shown to follow the theories formulated.

God destroy the tower of babel just because he do not want men to become better. He curse abel (or caine) just because he offer some plants to him as he is a gardener. He almost wipe out the whole world just because he think the world is not fit in his eyes. He kill all the firstborn children in egypt for moses just because he want to prove his point. He kill all the midianites and make them slaves just because he want his people to take over their land. There is no good and evil deeds here.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>If u talk about teachings, they r already here before christianity or jewish started. Put it tis way, if god want people to behave like him he can just snap a finger and we become like him. Why resort to such trouble ? In the past there r no real laws and therefore people relies on religion to scare people into believing as well as explaining why thunder comes about. There is really nothing divine to it. </blockquote>I agree with you that before Christianity era, there were already many teachings about God by other religions. Many of these teachings were probably lost in history.<br><br>If we as stated previously look at the whole issue of God's existence in perspective, I think we can have a better and more objective discussion on this issue rather to formulate our own view that "if god exists, there will be fairness and there would not be so much injustices according to our human's ethical values and morality"<br><br>The perspective is (1) the universe is extremely complex yet logical (2) could the universe including life and intelligence have been created by itself or by some omnipotent power we call God.<br><br>Having asked the above-stated question, we then next ask (1) should we believe God's past revelations to us in bible or history or (2) should be disbelieve and say that "I want scientific or empirical proof (based on human physical laws) before I believe what God presumably have taught as revealed in the bible".<br><br>Some people say that unless "god appears to me" or "someone proves to me scientifically, or empirically, I will not believe God exists"<br><br>Others might say that since there were so many religions, "how do I believe which one is correct".<br><br>Some are too sensitive about their own religions being criticised.<br><br>Some claimed that many of the past revelations about God were superstitions on the ground that science has made so much progress and proven many things said by religions to be false.<br><br>If we look at the whole issue about God from a certain objective standpoint or perspective as I have proposed in the foregoing, I think we can make more sense and will not be swayed by a lot of emotional and subjective factors.<br><br>I could say for myself that since science up to this day cannot prove anything about the supernatural or God's world or explain the nature of the larger universe and even our own limited planet we live in, it would not be very correct for scientists to say that they have proven that there is no god. Just ask again, if there is no God how do we come to have such a wonderful Universe and Life and how were they created in the first place. Some say that it is nature and do not want to partake in further discussions how nature was created.<br><br>Once we as sentient and conscious human beings cannot answer the primary question about creation of universe or nature, we could only rationally conclude by logic (not physical laws as such laws cannot explain or prove god) conclude that there has to be a omnipotent being we call god or allah or almighty.<br><br><blockquote>Why don't god just exist alongside him ? I am pretty sure every people will just convert immediately if he shows up. Why hide himself ? Why hide heaven and hell ? Why rely on faith which is shown to be able to lead people to the wrong direction. </blockquote>After answering the above-stated objective question about nature of the universe and concluding tentatively that god has to be the creator, we then will notice that there were pervasive revelations of God's existence and his diverse teachings throughout the ages.<br><br>Men cannot prove God's revelations as scientifically or empirically correct and substantiated. But men also cannot deny them and say that they were totally untrue and unfounded except that every one has its own religion and view about science's conquest of ignorance.<br><br>Scientists cannot disprove existence of God. Many of them were believers though they were great scientists because probably they were personally touched in some ways by god personally. These scientists do not in my believe think that there were no god or their powerful ability to reason the physical world will provide all the answers about likelihood of another realm higher than the physical world which can only be explained by non-physical laws. Good and evil concept as revealed to us and the need to be in conformity with God's laws and god's codes of conduct seem very reasonable to me. God has proven his pervasive teaching and is seen to be trying today through more revelations in personal ways to tell us to be good and do good.<br><br>Whichever religion is wholely in conformity with such god's ways and principle and are able to touch our own personal lives will at the end be the religions most convincing to us human beings, I believe.</div>
