It's not God loves us any less, it's that he can't do anything unless we accept his love.<br><br>Like a parent who has nothing but love for a child, the child could be rebellious and not believe in the parent. The child is always begging for toys and gifts that the parent doesn't want to give. Hence the child concludes the parent doesn't love the child.

The last SiS post does say abit on where i get the idea though.<br><br>If your God truly loves unconditionally, then there would be no need for any qualifying "but"s.<br><br>The fact that your God sees fit to punish a lifetime of sin with an eterity of punishment makes it hard for me to believe that the punishment is morally justified.

Let me try to put your analogy into perspective. If the child is always begging for toys, and the father punishes him. By stoning the child. To death. Will we still be of the opinion that the father loves the child? Will we still be of the opinion that the father is morally right?<br><br>Drawing a parallel, if a government were to dish out death penalty to people who chew gum, or to people who had a single strand of hair falling to the ground (littering), will we still be of the opinion that the law is morally right and should be upheld at all costs?<br><br>Of course, one might qualify his god as the creator and as such can do whatever he/she/it likes. This agains makes me question the characteristics attributed to such a god.<br><br>I only wish christians would understand that telling me that i would go to hell if i do not believe in his god is not a very convincing tactic.<br><br>Edit: Opps, the auto logout messed up my post.

Though this motivates this counterargument, the basis is the assertion that it is not the onus of non-Christians to support their case against Christianity, but it is incumbent upon Christians, if they desire others to adhere to their dogma, to prove their case against non-Christianity. <span style="color: red;">Thus far, in 2000 years, they have failed to do so. </span><br><br></div></blockquote></div>

Because the critic is in fact asking the christian to make a representation of the difficult to accept parts of the bible. For a christian to preach selectively, and deliberately ommiting the difficult to accept parts, one could then say that the said christian is misrepresenting the bible (Only selected parts were presented).<br><br>Up to this point, most christians might ask the critic to not take the difficult to accept parts literally, but to take a metaphorical reading on it. This then raises the question of when to take which parts of the bible metaphorically and when to take which parts of the bible literally. Because, it is quite obvious that most christians, if not all, take verses like "God loves me" quite literally.<br><br>Even the singular qualification, "God loves me", is debatable at best, as reasonable representation. The phrase itself is very much taken out of context of the entire bible. For some quick reading will show that "God loves me [b]conditionally</strong>"<br><br>Christians also make claims on the attributes of their god. Most christians, if not all, claim that their god is good and benevolent. To these claims, critics again point to the selective quotes which were left out by the preacher during preaching.<br><br>At no time do, most if not all, critics make any claims about the Christian god. What they do, is to attempt to refute the claims made by Christianity's followers.[/b]</blockquote></div>

God does not want to condemn mankind to hell forever. Hence the reason why Jesus Christ had to die on the cross. So that there may be a way that man can go to heaven still. It's not so much that God created hell specifically to throw man into, it's more of God letting have man choose a way out.<br><br>I'm not asking you to believe me that there is heaven and hell.

Perhaps by destroying 1 city, God is able to prevent the damnation of 10 cities? On a cosmic sense, who really knows whether it works out for greater good or greater bad.
