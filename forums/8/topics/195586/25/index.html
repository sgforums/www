Though it might seem like Skyfoo is asking whether the god created a substance called evil (Eg. Let there be evil), that however is not the case. Though there's no need to go into the intricate details of bible verses for this discussion, or it'll simply end with me quoting one verse and a christian quoting another verse and when all else fails, i get accused of quoting out of context.<br><br>Good and evil is not a substance but is what we percieve to be right and wrong. There are many things which one can call good and many things which one can call evil. The basic tenets of evil is suffering, misery and unfairness, though i might be missing on some things here.<br><br>As such, one might say natural forces like earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, hurricanes, floods are forces of evil, because it inflicts suffering onto people. The question then is why any god whose attribute is claimed as loving would allow suffering to be inflicted on his/her/it loved ones?<br><br>The point of making such a question is to bring the attention to a paradox wittingly or unwittingly introduced by theists.
