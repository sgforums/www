Then now you say, it depends on how you use that intelligence. So  which is which? Intelligence or no intelligence. If you depends on how you use your intelligence, then you cannot say intelligence "drives" people away? So please get it straight in your own head first.<br><br>Religion provides you with a set of moral codes? Which set is good? The Buddhists? The Christians? The Jews? The Muslims?<br><br>What in the world is the right faith in God? Is there a wrong faith and a right faith? Or is there only faith and no faith? Or Faith in God and Faith in idols? Which is which?

Think about it, why would a God who doesn't give a damn about the human race (letting us kill ourselves, letting disasters take away countless lives, letting humans kill animals for fun) be worthy of worship at all? Or maybe you christians are just boot-lickers trying to earn your ticket to heaven by pleasing your God regardless of whether you like it or not?</div></blockquote>Well because God leaves it up to man. What do you want? You want to be a slave to God? You want to be like the animals? Unable to make your own decisions and go soley by your God imposed instint? You do not want to be human?</div>

Are you God? Can you see the consequences of people's actions from eternity to eternity? How do you know what hell is? Did you go to hell and come back? How did you know that what the writers claim about hell is not just based on their own expectations?</div>
