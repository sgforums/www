He became involved with gangland activities after his release from prison at the age of sixteen. By the time he was seventeen he had become one of the top gang leaders in Colonial Singapore. At seventeen and half he was involved in a major gang war which resulted in the death of an opposing gang member. He was sentenced to hang for his involvement in the gang murder, but under Colonial (British) law at that time, no youth under the age of 18 could be hanged. So he was sentenced to be detained indefinitely during Her MajestyÂ’s Pleasure. This was worse than life imprisonment.<br><br>Pardoned and released after serving seven years in prison, Neivelle organized a new gang. He began to be involved in gang robberies involving firearms. His gang garnered thousands of dollars in cash and valuables before he was again arrested and slated for trial in Singapore's "high court" for armed robbery. While waiting for his trial to be heard, he faked insanity so that he would be sent to the mental hospital. There, with two other inmates he made a daring escape! They overpowered the doctor, bound the guard, and climbed on to the roof and jumped over a 20-foot wall to freedom!<br><br>He was at large for almost a year and became one of the ten most wanted men in Singapore until he was recaptured. Pressured into a plea bargain and confession, he was sentenced to seven more years, plus whipping.<br><br>His pattern of being tough, merciless and sly continued in Changi Prison. Soon he had people doing his laundry, cleaning his cell. He even managed to profit through gambling and a money-lending racket.<br><br>Then had come his Nemesis. Neivelle gritted his teeth at the thought of that prison guard, insulting, embarrassing him and provoking him into retaliationÂ—and again, solitary confinement. Eventually Neivelle concluded that he was fated to be sent into solitary and determined to make that guard pay. He had found a piece of metal. Day after day he patiently sharpened it on the cement floor of his prison cell, honing it into a crude dagger. At last he was ready for the hated guard.<br><br>He waited expectantly for the man to come on duty, but the guard did not show up. Instead the next day there was a surprise search of all the prison cells and the dagger was found. He was immediately rushed into the maximum security solitary confinement cell.<br><br>It was during this time of confinement that Neivelle began to experience the most dreadful feeling that almost drove him insane. His long period of confinement had caused his mind to succumb to "claustrophobia." A terrible disease of the mind that caused him to experience dreadful nightmares and sleepless night of fear. Fear of being buried alive in a coffin. It was during one of these nights when he was experiencing one of his worst attacks of claustrophobia that he had this miraculous experience. Another prisoner from a cell nearby had managed to smuggle some pages from a book for him to read. Neivelle found out that the pages had been torn out from the New Testament. In anger he had crumpled the pages and flung them away towards the toilet bowl in his cell.<br><br>Neivelle's eyes wandered to the crumpled pages on the floor. Frustrated and bored, he finally picked them up and began to read. An old man, Zechariah, and his aged wife (probably a hundred years old, thought Neivelle) had no children. Then there was an angel telling this old man that his wife would become pregnant and bear a son! What a joke! This old lady pregnant! Smirking at the impossibility, he read on. The second story was just as incredible--a young woman was also told by the angelic visitor that she too would become pregnant! His cynical mind began to be very amused as he thought of how stupid the story was. Maybe, he mused, the angel would appear to a young man next and say to him, "Young man, YOU too will be pregnant!" but he continued to read on. "You shall call his name Jesus," the next line reported the angel saying. Neivelle tensed. That name! What had that Christian teacher said about this name? That if you ask anything in the name of Jesus, God would do it? Yes, that was it! He would do just that!<br><br>"God," he said, "in the name of Jesus, get me out of this room!"<br><br>He closed his eyes really tight as he made that prayer, half expecting the door to open but it did not. The next day came. The door remained closed. Angry that nothing was happening he shouted at God.<br><br>"God, I won't let you off! Get me out of this cell!" he demanded. The next day came, and the next and the next. Neivelle continued to remind God that he was asking in the Jesus' name and he expected an answer. "God, I hold you to your promise," he declared grimly. The 10th day - and the 11lth. Apparently God was not listening. The 15th day of that desperate prayer came. Finally, the door was opened! As Neivelle was led out he turned to look back at the cell where he had been confined for almost three months. On the door was pinned a notice: "Prisoner 7172 is to remain locked under maximum security until the day of his discharge." It was signed by the prison superintendent.Â”<br><br>Somehow that order had been cancelled! When Neivelle reached the Block B area, his fellow inmates were incredulous. "How did you get out?" they queried, amazed.<br><br>The name of Jesus was on Neivelle's lips. "But how could he say it?" Neivelle reflected. "It would sound as silly as to say he was pregnant!" To be "religious" would make him out as a "queer!" By then he had earned the nickname "Iron man*"<br><br>He saw admiration in the eyes before him and his pride soared.<br><br>"I threatened the superintendent into letting me out," Neivelle told his audience.<br><br>Yet down inside Neivelle felt convinced that Someone bigger than any prison superintendent, some Divine Power had worked in his behalf. He was certain that a miraculous answer had been given to his prayers. Why would the superintendent change his mind? Why would he risk allowing an "incorrigible" and dangerous inmate who was a security risk to associate with the other inmates? The name of Jesus was again the only convincing answer to those questions.<br><br>The relief of that relative freedom was tremendous. But soon the monotony of prison life returned. No one came to visit him, not even his mother who previously had never failed to come and visit him. Finally a letter came from his brother: their mother, hospitalized with cancer, had been given only two weeks to live.<br><br>Yearning to see her one last time, Neivelle asked to be allowed to visit her. His request was denied.<br><br>Memories rushed in - his mother in the harsh days of the Japanese occupation giving her rations to him and his brother. When Father had frightened his sons with horror stories, it was Mother who came in the night to calm their fears. It was Mother who had loved him through all his troubled years, Mother who had been too indulgent with her lawless son. Full of remorse, Neivelle wished for opportunity to say he was sorry and to beg her forgiveness.<br><br>Soon word came from his brother that Mother had died, screaming and reaching out for her absent son. Shame for his shabby treatment and indifference to his mother overwhelmed him. Added to this burden was the recognition that now there was no one who cared for him--no one. "When I get out, who will receive me?" he moaned.............<br><br>(continued in the url provided)<br><br></span><br><br></div>

I don't know why suddenly these become important but anyway u can find more in the website. I just paste a shorter one here.<br><br><a href="http://www.atheistalliance.org/awakenings/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.atheistalliance.org/awakenings/index.php</a><br><br>As a child my mother made me go weekly to Sunday school and I often wondered about the truth in the stories we were told in the weekly lessons about various miracles and so forth.<br><br>As a result of my perfect attendance I received a bible as a reward. I began to read it and thus began asking questions my mother could not answer. Among other things, why in the commandments, god says he will punish people three or four generations down the line for the sins of their grandparents and great grandparents. Not very rational, even to an eight year old.<br><br>The more I read, the more I realized that the whole thing was quite ridiculous. One thing especially, the core of the Christian religion rests wholly on the alleged resurrection. The church we went to had a big banner over the altar "If He is not Risen, our Faith is in Vain". Now if god wrote (or inspired) the four gospels, why in the name of peace can't he get the story straight? Read all versions of what happened after the crucifixion up until the ascension into heaven, they are all different, the number of witnesses, who saw what, who was there, when events took place, etc. The only logical explanation is that the whole thing was made up.<br><br>I could go on about the Bethlehem story, all the world being taxed by Caesar, (just a minute, Nazareth was outside the borders of the Roman Empire, thus not subject to a Roman tax) and why travel miles to pay taxes, I am sure the Roman tax collectors were more efficient than that, they surely came and collected and not expected you to travel miles across the desert carrying sums of money. Highwaymen would certainly be aware of all this and would have a field day. And if wise men came from the east following a star, then the star must have risen in the west for them see it as they traveled from the east, otherwise the star would be behind them. No astronomical object rises in the west anyhow. But you get the idea.<br><br>Another one here<br><br>I was brought up in the Catholic faith, and once I learned about its gory history, ( at about the age of 15) rejected it with deep disgust. After a while, I went through the "born again" psychology, which didn't last long - once the rational mind reasserted itself, I was OK again. But for years after that I studied religion - EVERY religion - with devouring curiosity, and, of course, the hope that there was such a thing as "Truth" or a philosophy that would give my life some meaning. Strangely - it was during a trip around India when my awakening occurred. You hear so any tales of Westerners going there to "find" themselves/become enlightened/whatever, but in my case it had the opposite effect. After a few weeks of trudging through temples which ranged from the aesthetically gorgeous to the downright tawdry, and marvelling over the geometry of their structures whilst being repulsed by other aspects of these complexes, I found myself on a boat drifting along the Ganges at twilight in the "sacred" city of Varanasi, and then it happened.<br><br>Five magnificent specimens of manhood ( drool!) clad in vermilion and saffron robes, and accompanied by a percussion orchestra, commenced their evening devotion to the Goddess. It was most impressive to watch, pure theatre, with the colours and sounds having an hypnotic effect on the senses, not unlike the High Tridentine Mass of my youth! For about an hour they offered perfumes, flowers, rice and other items to the deity. My guide, a highly educated man from Rajasthan,, then explained that this ceremony had been performed every night on the banks of the Ganges since time immemorial. Its origins were already lost in antiquity when Herodotus witnessed it, 2 millennia ago!!<br><br>Something then came over me - a sense of the utter futility of it all...Regardless how visually pleasing the scene was, what good had it ever done anyone? I then remembered my own devotions to a heedless Deity, wherein I made Novenas, begging God to heal my father of his rages and heavy drinking...and those prayers had not been answered. I then thought of the 911 WTC atrocity, and reflected that if there were a God, it was painfully obvious that he/she/it doesn't give a flying fuck about anything we do, whether good or bad. We can offer incense, candles, flowers, and all sorts of goodies as bribes to our supernatural parent, and the Deity remains resolutely mute. It always has, and it always will. It cares not whether we are killed in war, or buried under a plane-devastated building, or if we contract ebola, or are swept away in a flood or burned to cinders by a volcano. It doesn't care if we are kind to our neighbours and generous to the less fortunate, or if we spend our lives in rapine and pillage..<br><br>Useless, useless, it is all useless. That's probably the best quote from the Bible!<br><br>Thank you, Brahmin priests, for bringing this message home to me. I shall always remember you with gratitude.<br></div>

I'm not saying you should believe just like that, but just to point to you there is a common trend. And it's not that we're all stupid in the same way and getting brain washed. I can strongly say those here who believe do so because of their personal experiences, not because people keep telling them over and over again. So many people keep "telling and reminding" you as well, how come you're not believing? It's not because you're more discerning or more intelligent, you've already hardened yourself.<br><br>Christianity isn't what you think it is, that we keep telling you the same thing over and over again till you chant it. You say that from many cases of converts you see, they're all teenagers in it for the POP factor, then in my opinion, they're not true christians, if they don't believe and their true purpose is not there. A lot of Christians aren't actually like that, although maybe you don't realise or you only settle your attention on such. You see what you want to see. But not all Christians are like what you say.<br><br>As for the second group, I think you're really mean. If Christianity helps people to reform and to lead better lives, isn't that a good thing? During their greatest time of need, they feel that God was the one who came to help them to give them a new life again. A new and better life. I think anyone would want that.</div></blockquote>so do u all care to share the personal experiences? didnt really see any from u all. perhaps we can understand more? since u admit that quite many of those teenagers are not christians, would u agree that there's some sort of brainwashing involved? if not, why are they converting to christianity? for the last bits, what have god helps them? all the interviews i had seen, it only tell us that a priest consult them, and they said they are saved and turned to christianity. nth else</div>

To be clear to you, not every person who declares himself a christian or catholics are like your friends. And in fact, should not be. If you choose to use your friends as examples, then I'm sorry you are using bad examples to your case.
