All the stepfather did is abuse the child and he just claim he is nice.<br><br><blockquote>Atheists view it as God is able to save all mankind but he chooses some to go to hell. </blockquote>Atheist view god as fiction  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> They just feel tat christians have a wrong impression of their god.<br><br><blockquote>Well, I can form a religion base on a fiction god which u can advise me.
