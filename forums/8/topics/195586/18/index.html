Everytime they have doubt they have sinned because they also believe that the doubt they have is a sin.<br><br>So you see, what they will tell you is that you also must be like them and simply "believe" even if you find no reason to.<br><br>What Jesus taught was that you must believe Him when He said "You must Be Born Again to enter into the Kingdom of God."<br><br>So you see, only people who are born again will be able to tell you how they know God exists and that is, they are having a relationship with God and talks to God and God talks to them.<br><br>So what is to be Born Again? It is not what these people are trying to tell you; and that is "believe" even when you think it is stupid to do so.<br><br>Do not ever believe when you think it is stupid to do so or you will become one of them. Do not believe in the existence of God unless God speaks to you.<br><br>So now you have a problem. How can God speak to you if you do not even believe God exists in the first place?

Our relationship with God has nothing to do with our academic results. So it does not change what we think or know about our God. So if anything, you are the one who is diverting the topic and attention. I only said said that earlier post because I feel it's off topic from the main discussion in itself.<br><br>I have already told you, God is not a tool, an item or a person you summon to appear to you, to do your every whim just to prove he exists. It's that simple, but I understand your sceptical mind finds that hard to accept. Because how you expect to see God isn't how Christians really see God. And how Christians see (or rather should) God just cannot be measured by the way you do it. God isn't someone or something you can put a quantity on. God is not an idol.<br><br>You choose not to believe is not because you are smarter, but rather you choose to. In any case, being smart doesn't mean you are always right. Smarter in itself is subjective. Just like what I mentioned in another post.<br><br>Probably in your own opinion, choosing to believe in God is stupid, and that choosing not to believe in God is smart. In that case there's no point saying anything to you, because you have already set your mind. Basically, that ends the discussion there. Matter of opinion.</div>

But by already rejecting him outright and disbelieving him, there's no way he can have a chance to come into your life. I'm not sure if it helps, but you can look at one of the replies in the other thread you posted that is already closed.<br><br>You are trying to see God in a way that you expect, in other words you defined God for yourself in a way that God isn't.

If your religion is true, then i consider myself saved when i'm going to a destination different from yours <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Eternal torture seems so much more palatable than your holier than thou demeanour.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by casino_king:</div><div class="quote_body">You will just disappear into oblivion... that is so sad, if you are having a blissful life.... worse than hell.<br><br>Hell, at least you are still in existence. That is why life sentence is better than death sentence. Considering how people get used to any and every condition they are in, they will probably get used to hell in no time, much less eternity.</div></blockquote>Yes.. its sad and scary isn't it? But i accept death for what it is. And because my life is my one and only existence, i do find it precious and meaningful. If you told me believers of afterlife find life precious and meaningful, then i am inclined to believe otherwise. For most of these believers, this life is merely transitory and  they are just waiting to get to a better existence.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by babybabyohbaby:</div><div class="quote_body">And to the threadstarter, dont criticize and doubt about my God.<br><br>Go worship your idols and nature.</div></blockquote>By the usage of the word idols, it appears that you think that any religion other than yours is false. But if you do not want people to criticise and doubt your religion then you should not do so to other religion too. Do not ask to be priviledged.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Just for the record, the smarter ones in society were the ones declared the world was flat.</blockquote>Sorry man, tat was wat christians believe in the past because in the bible they treat the world as flat. THe bible keep saying four corners of the world, a phial of water on top of all the land etc and all of tat can be achievable only if the world is flat. By the way they also think the sun revolves around the earth<br><br><blockquote>And doctors/medical people used to not believe man had a heart/brain and all. They use to burn people who think so and declared them as witches or something like that. </blockquote>Which doctor ? Before christ ones? The ones in the deep amazon ? Or the ones from the church ? In the bible they tell priest to just let the people drink some holy water to get cured instead of visiting doctors. And the witch burning is conducted by christians to kill people from other religion<br><br><blockquote>Physists used to believe that positive charges went from positive end now we know electrons are actually the things that travel. Science used to declare that light does not have wave properties. Any A level student now can tell you that isn't the case. </blockquote>Isn't tat the contribution of science to actually know wat is even electrons ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Wat knowledge do u get from the bible regarding to electrons ?<br><br><blockquote>Science theories are ever changing, what one smart scientist said once is later shown to be untrue. Being smarter doesn't gurantee you're right. Smart in itself is a subjective thing. Like how I meet straight A students who can't use a spanner, or Uni graduates who don't know the difference between a cashier's order and a check, or the diff between optical and digital zoom on a camera. </blockquote>Straight A student doesn't means they can do EVERYTHING. If u tell einstein to fix his car, he probably couldn't either. Does tat means the car mechanics is smarter than him ? But when it comes to solving equations, u probably can't hold a candle to einstein. People with different profession specialise in different things. Given the same expertise, it is generally true tat the smarter person performs better than the stupid ones. Jack of all trades is not "smarter".<br><br>However as said before stupid means they r easier to be conned, cheated and harder to tell right from wrong. From the replies of christians, it seeemed tat they like the title of being stupid and it actually enhance the relatonship with god. Frankly I think tat is quite right.<br><br>I think for the rest of the people, just forget it. There r people who can't tell the difference whether their god is loving or hating (For any loving acts u can named, I can name 5 more punishment he met out) say he is perfect when they know he is unfair, don't understand him, can't tell 3 distinct things can't be 1 at the same time, talk about sin yet sin is never a requirement for heaven and hell and believe the heaven is a place to go to when it may very well be like earth since everybody tat went there is like any people u see on the streets. Heaven is gonna be like earth except u get to see gemstones here and there.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This morning there was a knock at my door. When I answered the door I found a well groomed, nicely dressed couple.<br><br><strong>The man</strong> spoke first: <span style="font-style: italic;">Hi! I'm John, and this is <span style="color: darkred;">Mary</span>.</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Mary</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;"> Hi! We're here to invite you to come kiss Hank's ass with us.</span><br><br><span style="color: green;">I</span>: <span style="font-style: italic;">Pardon me?! What are you talking about? Who's Hank, and why would I want to kiss his ass?</span><br><br><strong>John</strong>: <span style="font-style: italic;">If you kiss Hank's ass, he'll give you a million dollars; and if you don't, he'll kick the shit out of you.</span><br><br><span style="color: green;">I</span>: <span style="font-style: italic;">What? Is this some sort of bizarre mob shake-down?</span><br><br><strong>John</strong>: <span style="font-style: italic;">Hank is a billionaire philanthropist. Hank built this town. Hank owns this town. He can do whatever he wants and what he wants is to give you a million dollars, but he can't until you kiss his ass.</span><br><br><span style="color: green;">I</span>: <span style="font-style: italic;">That doesn't make any sense. Why...</span><br><br><strong>John</strong>:<span style="font-style: italic;">Who are you to question Hank's gift? Don't you want a million dollars? Isn't it worth a little kiss on the ass?</span><br><br><span style="color: green;">I</span>: <span style="font-style: italic;">Well maybe, if it's legit, but...</span><br><br><strong>John</strong>: <span style="font-style: italic;">Then come kiss Hank's ass with us.</span><br><br><span style="color: green;">I</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">Do you kiss Hank's ass often?</span><br><br><strong>John</strong>:Oh yes, all the time...<br><br><span style="color: green;">I</span>:And has he given you a million dollars?<br><br><strong>John</strong>:Well no, you don't actually get the money until you leave town.<br><br><span style="color: green;">I</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">So why don't you just leave town now?</span><br><br><strong>John</strong>:You can't leave until Hank tells you to, or you don't get the money, and he kicks the shit out of you.<br><br><span style="color: green;">I</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">Do you know anyone who kissed Hank's ass, left town, and got the million dollars?</span><br><br><strong>John</strong>:My mother kissed Hank's ass for years. She left town last year, and I'm sure she got the money.<br><br><span style="color: green;">I</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">Haven't you talked to her since then?</span><br><br><strong>John</strong>:Of course not, Hank doesn't allow it.<br><br><span style="color: green;">I</span>:So what makes you think he'll actually give you the money if you've never talked to anyone who got the money?<br><br><strong>John</strong>:Well, he gives you a little bit before you leave. Maybe you'll get a raise; maybe you'll win a small lotto; maybe you'll just find a twenty dollar bill on the street.<br><br><span style="color: green;">I</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">What's that got to do with Hank?</span><br><br><strong>John</strong>:Hank has certain connections.<br><br><span style="color: green;">I</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">I'm sorry, but this sounds like some sort of bizarre con game.</span><br><br><strong>John</strong>:But it's a million dollars! Can you really take the chance? And remember, if you don't kiss Hank's ass he'll kick the shit out of you.<br><br><span style="color: green;">I</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">Maybe if I could see Hank, talk to him, get the details straight from him...</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Mary</span>: No one sees Hank, no one talks to Hank.<br><br><span style="color: green;">I</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">Then how do you kiss his ass?</span><br><br><strong>John</strong>:Sometimes we just blow him a kiss, and think of his ass. Other times we kiss Karl's ass, and he passes it on.<br><br><span style="color: green;">I</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">Who's Karl?</span><br><br><strong>John</strong>:A friend of ours. He's the one who taught us all about kissing Hank's ass. All we had to do was take him out to dinner a few times.<br><br><span style="color: green;">I</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">And you just took his word for it when he said there was a Hank, that Hank wanted you to kiss his ass, and that Hank would reward you?</span><br><br><strong>John</strong>:Oh no! Karl's got a letter Hank sent him years ago explaining the whole thing. Here's a copy; see for yourself.<br><br>To Be Continue... ...</div>

What sort of philanthropist kicks the shit out of people just because they're different?</span><br><br><strong>Jonh</strong> : <span style="font-style: italic;">It's what Hank wants, and Hank's always right.</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">I</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">How do you figure that?</span><br><br><strong>Jonh</strong> :<span style="font-style: italic;">Item 7 says 'Everything Hank says is right'. That's good enough for me!</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">I</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">Maybe your friend Karl just made the whole thing up.</span><br><br><strong>Jonh</strong>:<span style="font-style: italic;">No way! Item 5 says 'Hank dictated this list himself.' Besides, item 2 says 'Use alcohol in moderation,' item 4 says 'Eat right,' and item 8 says 'Wash your hands after going to the bathroom.' Everyone knows those things are right, so the rest must be true, too.</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">I</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">But #9 says 'Don't Drink,' which doesn't quite go with #2. And #6 says 'The moon is made of green cheese,' which is just plain wrong.</span><br><br><strong>Jonh</strong>:<span style="font-style: italic;">There's no contradiction between 9 and 2; 9 just clarifies 2. As to 6, you've never been to the moon, so you can't say for sure.</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">I</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">Scientists have pretty firmly established that the moon is made of rock...</span><br><br><strong>Jonh</strong>:<span style="font-style: italic;">But they don't know if the rock came from the Earth, or from outer space, so it could just as easily be green cheese.</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">I</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">I'm not really an expert, but I think the theory that the Moon came from the Earth has been discounted. Besides, not knowing where the rock came from doesn't make it cheese.</span><br><br><strong>Jonh</strong>:<span style="font-style: italic;">Aha! You just admitted that scientists make mistakes, but we know Hank is always right!</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">I</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">We do?</span><br><br><strong>Jonh</strong>:<span style="font-style: italic;">Of course we do, Item 5 says so.</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">I</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">You're saying Hank's always right because the list says so, the list is right because Hank dictated it, and we know that Hank dictated it because the list says so. <strong>That's circular logic, no different than saying 'Hank's right because he says he's right.</strong>'</span><br><br><strong>Jonh</strong>:<span style="font-style: italic;">Now you're getting it! It's so rewarding to see someone come around to Hank's way of thinking.</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">I</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">But...oh, never mind. What's the deal with wieners?</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Mary</span> blushes.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Wieners, in buns, no condiments. It's Hank's way. Anything else is wrong.</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">I</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">What if I don't have a bun?</span><br><br><strong>Jonh</strong>:<span style="font-style: italic;">No bun, no wiener. A wiener without a bun is wrong.</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">I</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">No relish? No mustard?</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">i:</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">Mary looks positively stricken.</span><br><br><strong>John</strong> shouts: <span style="font-style: italic;">There's no need for such language! Condiments of any kind are wrong!</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">I</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">So a big pile of sauerkraut with some wieners chopped up in it would be out of the question?</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Mary</span> (sticking her fingers in her ears): I am not listening to this. La la la, la la, la la la.<br>That's disgusting. Only some sort of evil deviant would eat that...<br><br><span style="color: red;">I</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;">It's good! I eat it all the time.</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Mary</span> faints.<br><br><strong>John</strong> (catching her): <span style="font-style: italic;">Well, if I'd known you were one of those, I wouldn't have wasted my time. When Hank kicks the shit out of you, I'll be there, counting my money and laughing. I'll kiss Hank's ass for you, you bunless cut-wienered kraut-eater.</span><br><br>With this, John dragged Mary to their waiting car, and sped off.</div>
