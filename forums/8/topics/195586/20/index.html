However that is not true, i will explain.<br><br>Atheists and critics do not make any claims about Christianity. Plenty of theists already do that.  Most christians, if not all, claim that the bible is the word of their god, and that it is a holy book, and probably the best book to read ever. Faced with such claims, critics would point to contradictory verses and some of the less socially accepted commands dictated within the bible.<br><br>A christian should not feel that the critic is misrepresenting the christian bible. Because the critic is in fact asking the christian to make a representation of the difficult to accept parts of the bible. For a christian to preach selectively, and deliberately ommiting the difficult to accept parts, one could then say that the said christian is misrepresenting the bible (Only selected parts were presented).<br><br>Up to this point, most christians might ask the critic to not take the difficult to accept parts literally, but to take a metaphorical reading on it. This then raises the question of when to take which parts of the bible metaphorically and when to take which parts of the bible literally. Because, it is quite obvious that most christians, if not all, take verses like "God loves me" quite literally.<br><br>Even the singular qualification, "God loves me", is debatable at best, as reasonable representation. The phrase itself is very much taken out of context of the entire bible. For some quick reading will show that "God loves me <strong>conditionally</strong>"<br><br>Christians also make claims on the attributes of their god. Most christians, if not all, claim that their god is good and benevolent. To these claims, critics again point to the selective quotes which were left out by the preacher during preaching.<br><br>At no time do, most if not all, critics make any claims about the Christian god. What they do, is to attempt to refute the claims made by Christianity's followers.</div>

However that is not true, i will explain.<br><br>Atheists and critics do not make any claims about Christianity. Plenty of theists already do that.  Most christians, if not all, claim that the bible is the word of their god, and that it is a holy book, and probably the best book to read ever. Faced with such claims, critics would point to contradictory verses and some of the less socially accepted commands dictated within the bible.<br><br>A christian should not feel that the critic is misrepresenting the christian bible. Because the critic is in fact asking the christian to make a representation of the difficult to accept parts of the bible. For a christian to preach selectively, and deliberately ommiting the difficult to accept parts, one could then say that the said christian is misrepresenting the bible (Only selected parts were presented).<br><br>Up to this point, most christians might ask the critic to not take the difficult to accept parts literally, but to take a metaphorical reading on it. This then raises the question of when to take which parts of the bible metaphorically and when to take which parts of the bible literally. Because, it is quite obvious that most christians, if not all, take verses like "God loves me" quite literally.<br><br>Even the singular qualification, "God loves me", is debatable at best, as reasonable representation. The phrase itself is very much taken out of context of the entire bible. For some quick reading will show that "God loves me conditionally '</blockquote></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by neutral_onliner:</div><div class="quote_body">Many Christians start with the premise that their theological assertions are indeed fact and that if others decide not to believe in them and live by them, they need to prove why they are not true. This is of course illogical, though I do not want to get into mixing logic with faith, since faith is ultimately what the Christian argument comes down to. One cannot mix logic and faith, as they are incompatible schools of thought.<br><br>Both sides of this argument make this mistake. Christians tend to use logic where it suits them, and leave the rest to faith. Opponents of the Christian position tend to use logic until it fails them or use it recklessly, ignorant of the importance of the paradox to the Christian premise.<br><br>In any case, fruitlessly these discussions invariably come to a circular argument. On one side, one cannot prove that God exists and that accepting Christ as oneÂ’s savior is valid. On the other side, one cannot prove this is not true. However, Christians who fall back on this argument as the basis for their own supposed faith are in fact agnostic.<br><br>It is doubtful that anyone exists who is not agnostic to some degree. To have faith, one must have some doubt. Without doubt, faith becomes knowledge, and no one knows with certainty even though they may give lip service to this as a demonstration of the depth of their faith. However, if God is really listening she will know the difference.<br><br>This is a good time to point out that although these debates typically come down to the contention over the existence of God, the Christian message is a great leap further. According to Christian doctrine, it is not enough to believe in God and be a good person. Additionally one must accept Jesus Christ as one's savior and so on. It is one thing to assert that God exists, it is quite another to make this stretch. Since most people in the West are exposed to no other monotheistic religions, Christianity becomes the official flavor of the Western World, comprising most any who would believe in God and agree with many of the precepts, yet who might not make the additional leap if equally exposed to other possibilities.<br></div></blockquote>I have chellenged the Cristians many time in this forums by asking them if they have any evidence of their claims.
