By putting the word Christians in double quotes, i take it that you think some crusaders are not, in your opinion, <span style="font-style: italic;">true</span> christians. I guess you must believe that Christians are not capable of commiting wrong, else they're no longer a true christian. Probably the only time you think people as true christians, is as and when you say so.<br><br>According to your own religion, only your god is the ultimate judge. As such, you have no right to say who, if anyone is a true christian. For all you know, atheists could be the ones going to your heaven and that your religion could be a test by your god to determine whether you're a rationale person or blind in faith.</div>
