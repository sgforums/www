He say tat he is born into one and from his post he implied tat he didn't study other religion and just inherit the one his parents give him</blockquote>1) I am not a "he" but a "she"<br>2) I am not even a Christian or born into one... and anyway, many Christians-by-birth that I know do check out other religions...  although some of them do so to check out what are the faults in the other religions... it's good to research the different religions to see what is best for you. i mean you can still decide which one works for you in life.<br>3) actually to tell the truth, I didn't even inherit my religion from my parents. My parents are of one particular religion and I am of another. I chose my religion myself because I felt the my original one didn't work as well for me... as I said, the "right" religion is what works best for you in life and that is what only you can decide... It's different from being "brainwashed" that your inherited religion is "right".<br></div>

Can anyone do nothing at all in their lives? No sin at all? If God want to judge u, can u dare to tell him u never sin at all in ur life?<br><br>Which is why ur works and merits won't you. As Sixsentinels put it, men are imperfect. Which is why Man can't save himself, but need Christ. Only faith in Christ will save you, not what u do.</div>
