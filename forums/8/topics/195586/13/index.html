I repeat. I am not christian. How do you assume I'm christian? Please check your facts before you make assumptions. Let me clarify my religion. Im Buddhist. I didn't want to reveal at first cos i felt someone will eventually say buddhist are such and such and something along that line and I can't be bothered trying to reply to such stuff. And I do not support any kind of christian- or other-religion-bashing that you guys are doing. We are supposed to be proving whether God does or does not exist, not to say that other religions are dumb and stupid and all religious people are stupid. That is just baseless and ignorant arguing for the sake of arguing.<br><br>stupidissmart said<br><blockquote>My belief is , the universe is created by itself.  As stated earlier, it is just like people saying who create air is the air god, who create earth is the earth god and who create the sun is the sun god. It is really just ignorant thinking due to lack of knowledge  The only reason why u believe god is the creator is really just because the story made sense to u  There is no evidence, no nothing and u just say it is created by god simply because u like the story of god more. </blockquote>Right. You think the universe created itself. And the only reason why you believe this is... "the story made sense to you." Where is your evidence that the universe "created itself"?<br><br>stupidissmart said<br><blockquote>I don't see the link why evolving science knowledge shows tat there is a god.  In the past men is worse still and don't even know wat is thunder. Just because men do not know everything doesn't mean god must exists. They r independent events. <span style="color: red;">However u got to admit tat science has reach a level of muturity tat it can be generally trusted. Otherwise why will peope have the computer and certain phenomenon has been shown to follow the theories formulated. I don't think anybody can doubt the muturity of science now. </span> </blockquote>So I take it you admit then that scientific theories are reliable. Let's try to prove this scientifically then. Let's take the Big Bang theory for the evolution of the Universe and use it to logically prove the existence of a God.<br><br>The Big Bang theory states that the universe was created some 1.5 million years ago. It states that the universe emerged with a "big bang" from a hot and ultra-dense state. Evidence for the big Bang includes observations from Earth of galaxies and stars moving farther apart from each other, proving that the universe is expanding. More info right here. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang</a><br><br>Now obviously something must have caused the big bang. Astronomer Hugh Ross in his book, The Creator and the Cosmos, puts the argument this way: "If the universe arose out of a big bang, it must have had a beginning. If it had a beginning, it must have a beginner.<br><br>There is the traditional first-cause argument that rests on the assumption that everything has a cause. Since nothing can cause itself, and since the string of causes can't be infinitely long, there must be a first cause, namely, god.<br><br>Also, Roman Catholic philosopher Saint Thomas's argument is this:<br><br>1. Everything is caused by something other than itself<br>2. Therefore the universe was caused by something other than itself.<br>3. The string of causes cannot be infinitely long.<br>4. If the string of causes cannot be infinitely long, there must be a first cause.<br>5. Therefore, there must be a first cause, namely god.<br><br>Hugh Ross adds on with<br><br>6. Everything that had a beginning in time has a cause.<br>7. The universe had a beginning in time.<br>8. Therefore the universe had a cause.<br>9. The only thing that could have caused the universe is god.<br>10. Therefore, god exists.</div>

Hawking's theory the universe has been made extremely complex by the phenomenon of black hole. At the point when big stars collapse all matters and physical laws cease to exist and no body would know anything about what happen beyond that black holes. Perhaps god has an explanation.<br><br>Now Hawking's explanation of black hole is being challenged by the new theory that Information is never lost in a blackhole and it can be restored at a certain point of time into a big bang to return everything back to a new creation. We are living under the influence of black holes !!!<br><br>How complex is the universe. Can it happen by itself without creation. It is getting more complex when it is now reasoned by scientists that information is not lost in black holes and one day information will be restored in a big bang from within the black holes. So a new world can be re-created from the old ...Let us hope God will help to show the way to explain all these...as man cannot explain them.</div>

I personally do not thinkg Christians are of higher IQ than on-christians either.<br><br>Also, I have taken a look at your link. Although well-written, I would say that a single test is inconclusive. Moreover, the report made use of the Mormons as an example, who although are religious, are not recognised as orthodox.<br><br>Also, even though the report seems to take countries into consideration, the countries talked about here are the poorer countries where education is more of a problem to begin with. Also, it is also in some of these countries that religion is being used as a tool for war. I.e; radical Militant Islam. This is a different scenario from within a peaceful, well-educated country where people have more choice over their lifestyles.<br><br>There are just too many factors to the so-called study.

King Kong can be proven as unreal because it's stated that it's fiction. There is an author claiming for it.<br><br>Besides, you're just mentioning the King Kong example just to irriate people for the sake of it.<br><br>The bible has no one who claims to be the author AND says its all fiction. To add, no one has been able to prove that Jesus Christ didn't exist, even though there have been attempts.<br><br>Just to be clear, your sweeping statement wasn't what you said about the bible.</div>
