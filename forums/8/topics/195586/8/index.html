            <div class='col-md body'>One last thing. Perfection will only occur after God's kingdom is established on Earth. And President Bush (I do not know whether he is Christian or not) is a human being, not God, and in Sixsentinels' view he is imperfect and fallible. So what makes him a better person than u?
