Even though it is sensitive as well it is worth discussing who we are and whether there is a god.<br><br>I personally believe that God exists in this world but we have no means to verify whether he exists or not because we are unable to prove anything other than our limited physical laws.<br><br>Why do I say god exists? I think God does exist for two reasons:<br><br>(1) Universe is too complex and too logical at the same time to be self-created. Some supernatural omnipotent power or almighty called God has created it. Man cannot prove God's existence. The fact man cannot prove God's existence does not mean God does not exist.<br><br>(2) God has consistently for many centuries revealed his teaching through many prophets to us men. Many of his teaching are very logical and reasonable. The more we think and reflect on God's teachings as revealed in the bible for centuries, the more we will be convinced that he is a good god and he wanted us to be like him - do good and be good. It is very logical. On balance of probability I prefer to believe that God has appeared to men and tried to teach us to be good and he exists even though we cannot prove his existence because men do not have to means to prove God who does not follow physical laws.<br><br><blockquote>2) The real God does not reveal himself until a species is capable of solving every mystery and answering every question that exists in the Universe.</blockquote>I disagree that Bible is totally without truths or basis. I don't think prophets are all liars or unreliable. Many of the God's revelation to prophets of the future has come true. So it is not true to say that god does not reveal himself until a species is capable of coming close to his god's truths and unveiled all the mysteries about this world or the universe. No body today is able to say that Jesus was not born and he did not try to preach god and his resurrection  as predicted by god and him. No body can say that he did not die on the cross and appeared resurrected even though we men cannot prove or disaprove his resurrection.<br><br><blockquote>3) We are a species out of trillions of others that have been created to be tested through the ages. If we can survive on our homeworld against the many natural and extraterrestrial disasters and threats, then we are one step closer to knowing about the real Creator.</blockquote>Men is an intelligent species so God has taken a lot of trouble to reveal his teaching to men. That is why in history as recorded in the bible God has revealed so much to men how to conduct themselves and be more like HIM in order to be saved. Such teachings cannot be proven by science but they are highly logical and believable by men's standard. So on logics and by deductions from all such God's teaching, men should decide whether or not to believe and have faith in HIM according to his wishes.  It is a very reasonable expectation of men and men should in their own welfare and wellbeing ponder carefully on all such evidences or presumptions of his revelations, to decide whether God exists and not demand that we prove his existence which by men's physical laws cannot be done.<br><br><blockquote>4) However, if we are able to not only survive the tests of time, but gather all the wisdom available about our Universe and its existance, then the Creator reveals himself to us, and this species ascends and builds the Universe alongside the real God.<br><br>5) In conclusion, your religion is nothing more than an assumption.</blockquote>I agree that if one day, men have become less self-centred and more men came to believe God and accept his teaching and have faith in HIM there is a distinct possibility that men may then become closer to God and may exist alongside him in whatever form God dispenses - whether as angels or souls without physical form and be born again like Jesus has demonstrated.</div>

'Having faith' can also be considered as a 'thing' isn't it?<br><br>In Buddhism, we are by nature already Buddhas. We just need to awaken to the truth. When you awaken, you attain nothing nor lose anything because the Truth has always been so. Also I can also say, does 'letting go' have to do with 'doing something in particular'? All other methods are only aids (i.e sitting meditation). But Buddhism isn't about meditation or chanting because if that is the case, we cannot be liberated in daily living, which is not the case. These 'methods' are important but not necessarily essential.<br><br>Also, faith is conditioned. Faith is still conditioned to conceptual knowledge and may not be unwavering.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>How u know evil persons go unpunished?<br><br>And did i say handdicapped and sick commit evil? Dun put words in my mouth ok</blockquote>U say evil get to be punished duirng their lifetime here so the idea of "reap wat u sow" is true. In tat case I expect the people who do more evil get to be punished more than the people who commit lesser evil. (Otherwise it again is not reaping wat u sowed) In tat case the borned hadicapped and the chronic sick are the ones tat appears to be punished the most. So u r really indicating tat they commit evil and they deserve their punishment<br><br><blockquote>Which is why ur works and merits won't you. As Sixsentinels put it, men are imperfect.

Only faith in Christ will save you, not what u do.</blockquote>tat is really the whole problem with christainity and why people felt it is unbelievable  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Christians teach people not to sin, yet it set an unfair system where people r punished just because they do not believe. It is really not practising wat is preached.

Some supernatural omnipotent power or almighty called God has created it. Man cannot prove God's existence. The fact man cannot prove God's existence does not mean God does not exist.</blockquote>If u ask me it is more harder to believe god is created since it is suppose to be more complex than the universe. The universe is logical and tat makes it more believable why it is created by nature. Why add something to make it become illogical ?<br><br><blockquote>God has consistently for many centuries revealed his teaching through many prophets to us men. Many of his teaching are very logical and reasonable.

It is very logical. On balance of probability I prefer to believe that God has appeared to men and tried to teach us to be good and he exists even though we cannot prove his existence because men do not have to means to prove God who does not follow physical laws. </blockquote>Personally I believe the direct opposite. In the bible god has shown himself to kill many people and is extremely cruel to any opposition even if they r mere children. And worse still many of the teaching goes against conventional scientific studies. On teaching good things, it is manily to do with politics as those tat teaches bad things will be labelled as cults and get eliminated<br><br><blockquote>No body today is able to say that Jesus was not born and he did not try to preach god and his resurrection as predicted by god and him. No body can say that he did not die on the cross and appeared resurrected even though we men cannot prove or disaprove his resurrection. </blockquote>The burden of proving christ has resurrected lies on the people who believes in it. However there r certain contradictions to his resurrection such as who is the first to witness him as well as a claim tat the many dead people start to walk on the street when he died. These dead people r suppose to be walking on the streets and shouting jesus is lord etc. If tat happens I am sure it is recorded in history but strangely no mention of such a strong miracle get recorded<br><br><blockquote>Men is an intelligent species so God has taken a lot of trouble to reveal his teaching to men. That is why in history as recorded in the bible God has revealed so much to men how to conduct themselves and be more like HIM in order to be saved.

Put it tis way, if god want people to behave like him he can just snap a finger and we become like him. Why resort to such trouble ? In the past there r no real laws and therefore people relies on religion to scare people into believing as well as explaining why thunder comes about. There is really nothing divine to it.<br><br><blockquote>I agree that if one day, men have become less self-centred and more men came to believe God and accept his teaching and have faith in HIM there is a distinct possibility that men may then become closer to God and may exist alongside him in whatever form God dispenses - whether as angels or souls without physical form and be born again like Jesus has demonstrated.</blockquote>Why don't god just exist alongside him ? I am pretty sure every people will just convert immediately if he shows up. Why hide himself ? Why hide heaven and hell ? Why rely on faith which is shown to be able to lead people to the wrong direction.<br><br></div>

The reason God does not give man proof is simple. Man cannot never conceptualise GOD. Man does not have that capacity. Any attempt at conceptualising God will result in an idol. Idols used to be cast in stones... but many seem to forget that the statues represent a concept of GOD. Without the stone statues but having a concept of GOD in one's head is equally idolatry.<br><br>While you are right in saying that the Prophets are not liars; you seem to think that God cannot or only speaks to and through Prophets. God reveals and speaks to anyone who calls out to Him.<br><br>The problem is idolatry. Men refuses to call out to GOD. They are more comfortable with god... the idol, whether they call themselves Christians or not.<br><br>I have checked with the christians in this forums.... they cannot accept that there is only one God. They claim to know that there is only one God but they cannot accept it. This is hindering their being born again as Jesus taught.<br><br>The other really funny thing is the concept that "believing" is all there is to it. Somehow FAITH in GOD has been watered down to simply to a strong belief in God and even worse, believe in "their God" as if they own God. What they end up with is believing in their idol.</div>
