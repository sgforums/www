I won't say you're wrong, based on your definition of morality. It's also a somewhat different perspective of God, since you feel God should be answerable.

It's like meeting a person, you don't know everything about the person from the first meeting. You have to develop a relationship to know the person better. I'm not suggesting you go specifically to City Harvest or my church btw. But just to answer your post.</div>

So I'd assume by apple you're referring to the forbidden fruit which Adam and Eve ate. I'm not going into the debate about whether Adam and Eve existed, neither am I going to talk about which foods are evil and which are not, or if all food is evil for that matter.<br><br>As I said before, good and evil is present because of the concept of choice. There is meaning to choosing to believe because there is a choice. You may think that why have the choice at all in the first place? You'd say we're better off not having any choice to be evil or to be wrong. If we debate on this, we'd keep going in circles. So my point is just that the reason for both good and evil to exist is because of the concept of choice.</div>

It's with people not giving you the answer you want to hear. You want God to physically appear before you like an object you summon.<br><br>It's like asking a person to show you the fruit they have. And all the person has is an orange, but you expect the fruit to be a pear.</div>
