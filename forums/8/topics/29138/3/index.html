It's an adjective generally defined to mean "Slow, or impeded".  In the context of ability it simply describes a person who is slow in development mentally, emotionally, and yes, even physically.  and while I may not agree with some of the views posted here i'd defend to the best of my ability your right to voice it.  makes the world a happier place.  now, respect my right:<br><br>"Fuck you all, retards."<br><br>man that felt good.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Allow me to explain my stand to the rest who are interested.<br>This argument is not just about me. By saying that she would like to keep Osama under her bed so she can pluck his chesthair(BTW this infatuation u carry is getting diluted in the humor section at best and turnoff at worse), that person simply makes light of the turmoil that is raging in the world today, and sheds light on the amount of distaste ( or taste ) she has for a mastermind of mass murder. Simply put, would you hide anyone who has committed such down right atrocities under your bed and display any act of affection for him? Osama clearly has no regards for humanity, without which human is no different from animals. Do not misunderstand however that I say otherwise of any other opposing parties in this thousand year conflict. Retaliation by killing has never been a solution, except maybe a pacifier of the inevitable eventuality. Eg: Pearl harbour-Japan retaliated to keep their supplies alive but ended up sacrificing millions and 2 cities.<br><br>Others I have seen MOCK in indignity at this dangerous leader, and scorn at his means of retribution, he who misleads by misquotation. FI seems to make friends with him. AngelDork supports her . Then they both flame me for viewing things in deviation. And so on ...<br>U may say that I am too narrowminded to be offended by such things but I feel naturally obliged to step in at this indifference so others may be reminded that such has not been the general view of the population.<br>At this point I would like to make my peace, having made known my intention to denounce a potentially misleading view and not to launch personal attacks.<br><br>PS: AngelDork, vulgarity or any english term is defined not by you but by the society. Just like the rules in a game. If u play it your own way, different or opposing to the laid out rules, you are in the wrong. You can of course choose to stick to your set of rules but then u'd be going against the other players, and that means u r considered to be out of the game. If u still think FUCK is not a vulgarity, then i challenge u to use it as your name.</div>
