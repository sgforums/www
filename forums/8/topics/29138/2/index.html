            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, I would like to bring to you attention of your misquotation of what I said in another thread. Or was it a modification on purpose on your side?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>I would urge you to go back and re-read all the relevant threads and observe the contents before you could lump them together with this matter here.<br><br>Secondly, if you have been reading everything <span style="font-style: italic;">objectively</span>, you should be hitting the roof at the people who posted the obnoxious pictures of our renowned terrorist leader, but why only picked on one thing that i said and even remotely linking it to something of another content totally?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Thirdly, if you are thinking of threatening my moderator status, let me explain to you again (and again and again), I, as like any other forumite is entitled to air my opinions in this forum, except with a little extra responsibility of keeping the peace and harmony in this virtual community. I do not see myself any different from the users here and I do not expect others to view me as higher authority. Bascially we are all here to share and to have fun.<br><br>Lastly, as much as I exercise freedom of speech, I do not childishly use FOS as a shield and say "i haf the right to post as freely as u". As I mentioned above already, this is a discussion board, a community where people come and share ideas and opinions or simply to have some light-hearted chat.<br>I have seen people who go on the battlefield, released an arrow aimlessly, then quickly cowered behind the shield and think that he has won the war!<br><br>I read ALL your postings in this forum so far, and I can safely conclude that what you are driving at is wholly personal and directed at yours truly. Perhaps with the fact that you have not totally understood, acknowledged and assimilated the sgforums culture, it is forgivable that you prefer to take a leave.<br><br>With that, I thank you for supporting sgforums for these 2 months and if you find that other forum culture to your liking, I wish you all the best.</div>

I don't think he was the one who created the pictures, i think he surfed the net and took out whatever he thought might interest us, and he put it here... he didn't commit any wrong !! i'm not siding with him lor, just that he accidentally offended u guys with 1 picture, i mean come on, i found some of the other pics quite funny... y dun we give him credit for the other pics that he took the effort to post and forget bout that one pic ?? make love not war folks.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>erm juz my 2 cents worth... im not siding with anyone at all... coz nobody is at full fault here... its juz a misunderstanding...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>First of all, I am so touched to see so many people here who have some love for people with special needs, not dat im saying da rest hates them, Singapore is far behind in terms of their mentality towards people with special needs, they think people with Down Syndrome did something bad in their previous life, they are possessed, they treat children with autism as crazy people and call them "Siao". We have to ask ourselves, why is this happening? Is it because Singaporeans are really dat ungracious and uncouth? I like to believe that we are not educated about special needs people, we do not know who or what they are and we do not understand their needs. I've seen people who are knows what special needs people are about, and trust me i was embarrassed by my own actions when i saw how they communicated with the special needs people. Lets not go and say dat dis person has no brain or no common sense or ethics to put dat picture in da thread... y dun we condemn da source of the picture instead... or rather let the public know dat there is nothing wrong with Down Syndrom people, they are juz specially different from us.<br>I believe that nobody can do anything intentionally unless they understand the situation and consequences. Other than dat, i believe wad trinity did was unintentional, and the rest dat followed was juz a great big misunderstanding...<br><br>Common Sense is Rare...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
