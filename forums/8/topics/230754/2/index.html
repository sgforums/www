You have nothing to lose for learning something new.  Who knows?  The course might turn out to be better than you thought.<br><br>Don't worry, you have plenty of other opportunities to play your games <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey TS, i understand how u think becos i am a student myself. u decide whether or not u want to go for the course, the choice is urs.<br><br>although the course is FOC, it isnt really FOC if u count in the transport costs to go to school and the time consumed, so if really think u wont benefit from the course, u are better off staying at home playing since playing relieves stress <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> , if the school asks u to pay the $200, just perservere and dont pay it no matter what<br><br>on the other hand, since the course is FOC, it is a good chance for u to learn something for free, good deal sia... do go for it if u think u can learn something useful out of it<br><br>ur actually much more luckier than me, i was forced to go for courses AND FORCED TO PAY FOR THEM... i feel like i am being robbed of all my parent's hard earned money by them, i guess they might be using this to earn more money for themselves... sigh... evil principals <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>now i have learned to keep my stand no matter wat they say<br><br>remember, the choice is urs, they cannot force u.</div>
