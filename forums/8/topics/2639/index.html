            <div class='col-md body'>I think the best thing for u to do now is to wait. As u said, there are probs with the r/ship b/w her and her bf, so I guess it wouldnt be that wise for u to enter the scene rite now..U should just stay as a friend and keep a safe distance. You wouldn't want to be the bad guy to further make break down the r/ship. Seems that she just wants somebody to talk to...if u approach her too soon, it might make her feel worse and add on to her probs. If u wait, there may be 2 results: 1. If she eventually does decide to end her problematic r/ship, you'll stand a better chance and u can also help her get over the whole thing more quickly by providing her with a shoulder to cry on or a listening ear<br>2. if she is able to make good her r.ship with her bf, then u will still be able to remain as frds as her without any awkwardness, and u shd be happy for her that she has found happiness at last...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's always been a principle of mine never to get involved with someone who's attached... trust me, the repercussions are almost always bad...yet, I'm a great believer in following your heart. Anyone see a contradiction yet?<br><br>Well, think about it. If you really feel for this girl you'd want her to be happy, right? Go ahead, be a true friend to her. Let her know that you'll always be there for her, but NEVER betray the trust that she will put in you by harbouring other intentions other that purely being her friend. It'll hurt not to be together with the one you love, but think of it this way: I presume you're still quite young. At this point in time, friendship will probably be more lasting than a romantic relationship.<br><br>Hope I've helped some.<br><br>------------------<br>Love &amp; poison,<br>Suede</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sniperjim,<br>I hope u know what u are in for if u go after this gal. I once told a good friend I liked her and have not heard from her since.<br>Maybe it is she is afraid to keep in contact with me because she may think I will go after her in future again.<br>Then u should think, are u crazy abt this gal because u are lonely? To tell u the truth, I felt something for this gal. She has a bf. But I was lonely and she was nice to talk to. I could really open up to her. And she could to me. But the bottom line is, I began to like her. Because I was lonely.<br>Although I told her my feelings, she rejected me and till now she has not called me. The thing is, I thought abt my feelings and found that I was lonely. She was a nice gal. Very dangerous combo. So if someone introduced someone nice and single to u now, say u find her attractive, would u still think of this gal?<br>Think abt it. Don't spoil the friendship. If things does end between she and her bf, then there is nothing to stop u! But if she goes with u now, maybe later she misses her bf....make sure things are clear cut between she and bf......<br>just my thoughts.....hope u find it helpful!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm sure you already know what you're supposed to do right...you know you shouldn't get in between her and her boyfriend, but I know it's easier said than done. Well, there's really nothing much you can do until this crush wears off or until she breaks up with her bf (could be tomorrow, could be never...) But at this particular time, I think what you should do is to not reveal your feelings to her and don't do anything to 'chase' her. I'm quite sure you know it's the right thing to do but what makes it difficult is to be unable to tell her your feelings...Well that's all I can say now...what happens is really up to fate.

            <div class='col-md body'>Just think to yourself.......what if she broke off with her present bf to be with you. What's to prevent her from doing the same thing to you?? All I am saying is that, imagine how the bf would feel to have the gf snatch away from him?? If things doesn't work out between the two of them due to diff. in characters, then it is a diff. story. The proverb "All's fair in love" is not exactly true. If you don't respect others, how do you expect other ppl to keep their eyes or hands off your gf?? You reap what you sow. Trust me, dun be a third party. It will be easier on yours and her's conscience. But if things doesn't work out between her and her bf, I support you totally and encourage you to go for her. In the meantime, try fishing for unattached fishes......the ocean is so big, she is not the only one. I am sure the others in this forum will only be too glad to intro some of their younger sisters to you......hee hee. Or if you prefer Australian gals, maybe I can lend a hand??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Sniper,<br><br>Sammi here. Sounds like you have got yourself into a tough situation. Like you, I have recently run into this kind of problem.. But the difference is the guy that I like JUST got himself a gf before I have a chance to express to him. In the end, I chose to back out. Now, I still think of him, but I think I have get out of this whole mess gradually. I'm glad that I did not tell him, for I don't want to make things difficult for all the 3 of us...Y break ppl up (If they are not having any prob)?? You might not win her love and instead lost her friendship. I suggest you to wait, like what i am doing now, although is futile effort, but WE are STILL friends, u see... Hope that you will think it through and do give me a call when you are free to keep me updated okay?? Afterall, I'm in Singapre, not like Rinoa, she's in Canada, telephone bill is not veryt ex lah. And, Happy Millennium Year to U<br><br>cheerios,<br>Sam Sam</div>
