            <div class='col-md body'>i find that generally on the whole, guys don't like gers that are easily "gotten".  Perhaps they enjoy the thrill of the chase?  I would definitely like to hear opinions / experiences on this from both genders.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Ataraxia:<br><br>True, from my experince, guys are the best during coursthip.  However, putting them thorough pain and sufering is a little too cruel.  If they will treat u well, treasure u and respect u, they would do it forever even after the chase.  However, if the guy who would treat you like shit after the chase, putting him thorugh punishment would not cause him to treasure u more after the chase.  In short, a jerk will always be a jerk.<br><br>For me personally, I like doing the chasing.  I don't like too easy to get girls.  This does not mean that I like hard to get girls either.  I would say that I am the middle.  From the past, I have been turn off by girls who are as cold as the fridge (no response, no smile, no nothing).  Yuk! just turn me off, no matter how good looking they are and/or how nice their personalities.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do like girls who are hard to get, until I am stuck with going after girls who are attached. Been through 2 X 9 mths of going after 2 different attached girls. This is definitely challenging, but then what is the end result?? Failure!!<br><br>I had learnt a lot from these experience, but one lesson I had definitely learnt is that the efforts needed to go after such girls is going to be double that of someone who is single. Given a rating of 1 to 5, 1 being those easily to get girls and 5 the most tough (attached ones), I perfer someone around 3 or 4. 5 is a definite NO NO.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm.. "putting them thorough pain and sufering"? how much pain and suffering is there in making them wait a little longer? it's pretty obv tt most guys wont treasure somethg tt is so easily "available" and all i was saying was tt gers shldnt be so quick to give in and commit based on "love" or so they term it. i suggested tt they let the guys do the chasing a lil more, instead of seeming so easy.... as for guys being at their best during courtship..... isnt it true? a nice guy wld definitely still remain nice, but the peak of his "niceness" wld most definitely be during courtship when he hasnt gotten the girl yet. i'm not implying tt all guys are utter jerks after courtship, but tt they simply grow "lazier". tt's human nature. even gers let up on their efforts to dress up in order to impress... furthermore, tt was added as a afterthought, a so called "extra benefit" for not "succumbing" so easily to any boy you "love". kindly read my post thoroughly. i hate being misunderstood.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>knew a guy who chased this girl (away from another guy)  spent time wif her, "listened" to her, showed care for her and finally slept wif her.......and the day she found out she failed her exams coz of him? he said he not free to see her and wuz going to play mahjong<br><br>i think that the more 'dao' the girl is the more the guy wants her   but there comes a level of 'daoness' where beyond that, the guy isnt sure if he wants her coz he likse her or if he wants her coz she doesnt want him</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To ataraxia:<br><br>U hate being misunderstood; I hate being misintrepreted! HAHAHAHHA! Don't get me wrong! I am not taking your comments personally!<br><br>I experinced a test from my current gf when we were first going out.  I was driving and she was in my car.  It was just a month when the relationship first got started back then.  In the car, she said she knew this male friend a long time ago, and she said this guy likes her and she has once considered going out with him.  Worst, she said the guy called her yeaterday.  She said she still think about what they said over the phone.  Right then, when I heard this, my heart started to pound very fast.  You could say blame this on my lack of confidence! Yes, I lost my confidence since the relationship is only one month and we havent really even know each other taht well yet.  So, I was so nervous that she might go after this guy.  I was so nervous that I overlooked the light at the intersection while I was driving.  Well, I drove through a red lght and god must be blessing me or wat, there were no cars coming from left and right or else it could have been a very ugly scene for me and her.  Of course, when I drove through the intersection, she freaked out and ask why I dd not see the red light.  I told her my reasons for it.  She felt bad and guilty and later admitted to me that she was just testing me.  Was I upset or angry? No! I don't blame her for it.  I don't expect her trust me right away!  However, I just wished that she would have tesed me at the right time and place; not while I was driving.  From there on, she stopped testing me.<br><br>Yes, I agree that most? some? guys get lazy after the chase.  I admit that I am one of them.  But I still respect and treasure my girlfriend.  I have never cheated behind her.  Well, I still look at other girls when she is not around me.  U don't consider that cheating, do you?<br><br>Feedback?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For me, I think I belong to the low self-esteem type. If it's hard to get, then most probably she's not interested and I won't force it. Anyway, I won't want do anything out of the ordinary to impress her and win her feelings. Mabbe an occasional flower or two, movies, sweet talking... nothing special. Coz' we all know that elaborate attempts to win her will fade away after you've gotten her. At least I know that the occasional flower and sweet talking will last for as long as we're together.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>for most of the girls, we do want reassurance from our bfs that they still luv us.  that explains the "testing" bit i guess.  guys seldom talk openly about how they feel so its really hard to simply do guesswork!  by "testing" we can get a rough estimate and hopefully obtain some reassurance.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>what i don't get is that guys don't want us to make things too difficult for them when they are chasing us, yet they won't like it if we appeared to be too "dao".  huh?? we girls have to tread on such a very thin line!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I for one don't like the courtship period.  IDon't find it fun at all.  It's nerve wracking, painful, uncertain, and depressing.  I especially hate it when girls play hard to get....sure, there is a healthy amount of it...like not jumping up and down rite away when she know the guy likes her, but smiling and being a bit friendlier to make him know she's interested....<br><br>For me, if I chase a girl and she goes out on a date with me, I will call her afterwards, but then that's it....From that call onwards, I get really depressed thinking that she will never call me again or ask me out....I kind of need the girl to make the second move...give and take..I don't believe in doing all the work...I guess because I'm very sensitive (don't show it often, but doesn't mean I can't feel it), I get affected by emotions very much.  If she makes me wait too long, I'll get depressed and just forget about her...and frankly speaking, she would lose something good.<br><br>Maybe I don't try hard enough, but to me, I put my emotions into winning her, so I'm deeply affected by every little thing that happens or everything she says or does.  I remmebr the girl that I left because she slept with another guy...When I was chasing her, she was a typical hard to get girl...I tried so hard to win her...late night calls, repeated attempts at dates before  it happened.  Being extra friendly to her, making sure she's comfortable around me and etc...  To me she went over board(to most people it's normal amount of dao-ness)...I spent 2 weeks trying to win her over...In that two weeks, I borrowed $$$ and put on a brave front and everything I could think of...It got to the point where I was going to give up and I really cried becasue I was so frustrated....But eventually I did win her over...but it didn't make me treasure her any more or less...I was just pissed off that I had to do so much work for it.<br><br>From that moment on, I never tried as hard...The harder u try, the more u will get hurt.  This quote is very true, so there's just so much dignity a guy can decimate before he loses himself.  Whether I have to work for the girl or not, When I get in the relationship, it's me who works the hardest to keep everything going.<br><br>In my world, it's usually the women who get slack in the relationship.  After a while, they just take it for granted that the guy will do everything and then it gets to the point where they don't even bother to dress up for u anymore or to do anything nice for u...instead ur expected to do it.  All of my relationships have been like this...That's why I don't like girls who are hard to get..<br><br>I have a modicum of low-self-esteem and will take the hard to get actions of girls the wrong way.  if I talk to a girl and she doesn't seem interested(no smile, no exchange of conversation), then I will just walk away and forget it.  Whether I know she likes me or not...I really think that it's unnecessary to play these games.<br><br>Just my opinion.  I guess it depends on what kind of relationship ur looking for.  If ur looking for a serious relationship, then most likely u won't be willing to play hard to get games and will just move on...If ur looking for something fun, then it's probably enjoyable...Maybe that's my problem, I take relationships too seriously...<br><br>..hmm.maybe.<br><br>:-)<br><br>PS-Great subject Secret...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thanks firewire, &amp; everyone. appreciate all your replies very much.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>actually started this topic out of my own frustration.  there was this guy who was after me about a month ago. i didn't respond well initially, coz i didn't know him well. he persisted, sent a lot of msgs to my cellphone everyday, and would continue to ask me out for dates even though i rejected him a few times (i really had other plans on the days he asked me out).  in the end we did went out on quite a few dates and really enjoyed ourselves.  after a few dates, i took the initative to send msgs to his cellphone.  guess what? his replies came so infrequently then.  he seemed to be so busy.  does this mean that when i'm playing hard to get (which actually wasn't my intention in the begining), he would be more interested, but when i became more "accessible", then he found it boring and unexciting?  really felt exasperated and frustrated.<br><br>oh well. now is definitely not the time to dwell on this now.  its near to exams for me (the dreaded "E" word). =Ãž<br><br>[This message has been edited by SeCrEts (edited 07 November 1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Fire,<br><br>You spoken on my behalf!<br><br>Bad experience though, when a girl does not respond at all. On the other hand, when a girl respond well, that bring out another question in my mind. Should I go for it? And what happen if I am getting the wrong message?<br><br>Any hints on whether the message is rite or wrong?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think courtship is the fun part of a relationship. You're just testing whether the other party is interested in you. And you'll keep wondering, was what she did today a little hint for me or is it nothing at all. So you'll spend the whole day thinking about it and and be so obsessed with that girl.<br><br>I think different people have different ideas about the degree of "hard to get" they expect.<br><br>On a personal basis, i've been chasing different girls every six months but never got attached. Either i am a born loser, or its just that deep down, i like courtship but not relationships.</div>
