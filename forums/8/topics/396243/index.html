              Good afternoon to all. 
              Those who are reading this post should understand
              the values of having Malays art in sg.
              
              I can't believe that some are against out tradisional arts such as
              kuda kepang, is a mystic art to Javanese culture
              we have to respect that art even thou we dun really know it well.
              
              Why are people against it? I really wonder why? Have people ever 
              think of the bonding they have with their kids n family every 
              weekend? 
              There are also no harm done to others by watching. 
              This group of people, or shuld I call them kepangers , are also people too,
              they Play the tradisional gamelang, a musical instrument used by people be4 our forefathers used. There's no loud music, no microphone being used but
              normal tradisional instrument. N yet public kept complaining of noise.
               
              Is it being fair to the Malay community?
              Is it being fair that other religion can have permit to have their show
              of cultural arts but not the Malays.
              I'm not being racist but have Singaporean think 
              about other religion?? 
              
              N for the government body, have u ever been far to This people
              where are the core value or racial tolerance which our forefather instill on
              where is the love for arts n racial tolerance??
              
              Do advise
              for once I'm in support of tradisional arts. N I'm not bein racist or likewise
              I have never complain bout the Chinese having their tradision being show openly to public but it comes to the Malay society, public tend to make a big fuzz.

              <p>I think the Chinese is not against this art form.</p>
              <p>The art itself has various versions.</p>
              <p>Within the Malay communities, some are not comfortable with the practice.</p>
              <p>If all Malays are ok , then it's not right for other ethnic race to disapprove.</p>
              <p>I'm sure no one will complain about the toned down version.</p>
              <p>Malay culture has a long history in Asia, and is very colorful and intriguing.</p>

              Agree.
              I'm not saying all Chinese are against it.
               town concil are playng a part too.
              N recently bout PAP turnin a deaf ear to citizen
              this could also harm the diverse tradision

              <p>The "mystic" or "spiritual" version is not a nuisance when performed in the correct setting, eg, in an enclosed function room where only those who knows how to appreciate this art may attend.</p>
              <p>When practised in the open public, many young children and those who do not understand this art form may find it distrubing or alarmed by the performance.</p>
              <p>However, the toned down version does not require this kind of "restriction as it can be easily appreciated and accepted.</p>
