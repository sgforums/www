            <div class='col-md body'>BLACK ROBBERS - True Story By far the best email I've read so far....For<br>anyone who didn't see David Letterman's take on this: (And it's a true<br>story...)<br><br>On a recent weekend in Atlantic City, a woman won a bucketful of quarters<br>at a slot machine. She took a break from the slots for dinner with her<br>husband in the hotel dining room. But first she wanted to stash the<br>quarters in her room. "I'll be right back and we'll go to eat," she told<br>her husband and carried the coin-laden bucket to the elevator.<br><br>As she was about to walk into the elevator she noticed two men already<br>aboard. Both were black. One of them was tall...very tall...an intimidating<br>figure. The woman froze. Her first thought was: These two are going to rob<br>me. Her next thought was: Don't be a bigot, they look like perfectly nice<br>gentlemen, but racial stereotypes are powerful, and fear immobilized her.<br><br>She stood and stared at the two men. She felt anxious, flustered and<br>ashamed. She hoped they didn't read her mind but, gosh, they had to know<br>what she was thinking!!! Her hesitation about joining them in the elevator<br>was all too obvious now. Her face was flushed. She couldn't just stand<br>there, so with a mighty effort of will she picked up one foot and stepped<br>forward and followed with the other foot and was on the elevator. Avoiding<br>eye contact, she turned around stiffly and faced the elevator doors as they<br>closed.<br><br>A second passed, and the another second, and then another. Her fear<br>increased! The elevator didn't move. Panic consumed her. My God, she<br>thought, I'm trapped and about to be robbed! Her heart plummeted.<br>Perspiration poured from every pore. Then one of the men said, "Hit the<br>floor." Instinct told her to do what they told her. The bucket of quarters<br>flew upwards as she threw out her arms and collapsed on the elevator floor.<br>A shower of coins rained down on her. Take my money and spare me, she<br>prayed.<br><br>More seconds passed. She heard one of the men say politely, "Ma'am, if<br>you'll just tell us what floor you're going to, we'll push the button." The<br>one who said it had a little trouble getting the words out. He was trying<br>mightily to hold in a belly laugh. The woman lifted her head and looked up<br>at the two men. They reached down to help her up. Confused, she struggled<br>to her feet.<br><br>"When I told my friend here to hit the floor," said the average sized one,<br>"I meant that he should hit the elevator button for our floor. I didn't<br>mean for you to hit the floor, ma'am." He spoke genially. He bit his lip.<br>It was obvious he was having a hard time not laughing.<br><br>The woman thought: My God, what a spectacle I've made of myself. She was<br>too humiliated to speak. She wanted to blurt out an apology, but words<br>failed her. How do you apologize to two perfectly respectable gentlemen for<br>behaving as though they were going to rob you? She didn't know what to say.<br><br>The three of them gathered up the strewn quarters and refilled her bucket.<br>When the elevator arrived at her floor they then insisted on walking her to<br>her room. She seemed a little unsteady on her feet, and they were afraid<br>she might not make it down the corridor. At her door they bid her a good<br>evening.<br><br>As she slipped into her room she could hear them roaring with laughter as<br>they walked back to the elevator. The woman brushed herself off. She pulled<br>herself together and went downstairs for dinner with her husband.<br><br>The next morning flowers were delivered to her room - a dozen roses.<br>Attached to EACH rose was a crisp one hundred dollar bill. The card said:<br>"Thanks for the best laugh we've had in years." It was signed; Eddie<br>Murphy, Michael Jordan<br><br></div>
