What's your purpose in learning martial arts first? To be disciplined? For self-defense? For fun? For fighting? After you have decided, then you can choose which martial art to learn.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you guys ask me, for practical purposes boxing is a very good sport and so-called "martial art" as well. For other arts, well, the emphasis is always more on the "spiritual" and "theorectical" sides than the physical side, if you can get what I mean.<br><br>Like Aikido, Ninja-do, Kendo and Judo. All end with "dos". Why? "Do" in Japanese is more to do with training the mind, through meditation and other stuff.<br><br>On the other hand, Aiki-jitsu, Ninjitsu, Kenjitsu and Jujitsu all end with "jitsus". Why? "Jitsu" in Japanese is much more to do with the physical and killing aspects of the art.<br><br>Therefore if you really want to learn the real thing, learn the "jitsus". However, since guns were invented, the martial arts became obsolete. So they changed them into a sport. But of course, it would be a blood sport if they don't change the emphasis on killing. So all the "jitsus" became "dos". The emphasis was now on training the mind, and the killing moves were either not taught or modified.<br><br>So as far as a "do" art goes, I'm not really sure how far it would work in real life. Sparring is for points only, since the emphasis is on sport.<br><br>But hey, make love, not war!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The best info on the different style of Martial Arts is the Martial Arts faq that can be found using an internet search.<br><br>Before you embark on your training , you should ask yourself the reason why you want to take it up .<br><br>Here are some styles ,in my humble opinion , which would fit with the reason you are taking.<br><br>Reason                Style<br>Street-fighting       Muay-Thai , TKD ,Karate<br>Fitness               Kick-boxing ,Caepoira<br>Relaxation            Aikido, Tai-Chi<br>Sport                 TKD,Judo-olympic sports<br><br>Another thing about Martial Arts is the soft vs hard styles . In my humble opinion , hard styles teach you how to be average fighters in a short time while soft-styles teach you how to be good fighters in a long time .<br>So for me I prefer to mix hard and soft together with more emphasis on soft than hard . I do Aikido and sometimes mix in some kicking and punching techniques from other styles .<br><br>Some people like to say chinese is better than japanese or korean and so on but I think that it is not the martial arts that is crucial but the martial artist who uses the techniques that is more important .<br>You can learn many complex techniques but if you are unable to use your natural ability to execute them properly..whats the point?<br><br>But the most important thing about martial-arts is knowing it does not make you a super-man . It just gives you a set of tools to deal with the situation...wheither you win or lose depends on the situation not the colour of your belt .<br><br>If you are surrounded by many people , the best form of self-defense is running away...although my american friend once told me that could get you shot in the back from where he comes from...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
