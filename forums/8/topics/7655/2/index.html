            <div class='col-md body'>Me feeling more enlightened now and actually quite surprised to see so many of my fellow practictioner of martial artz here.<br><br>I've heard tat there are actually 2 'styles' in Wushu - Internal and External. From my limited knowledge, it seems that Internal Styles concentrates more on Qi circulation and develops yur 'inner strength' while External develops more of your physical power and strength.<br><br>So, has anyone here who's undergone many years of training in Qi and has an ability to actually use yur Qi to hurt someone or to cure someone???<br><br>Maybe I've been reading too many martial artz story of late,  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> seesh, me talking nutz again....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I study various forms of marital arts. Some of which I have learn myself, and some of which I study, for the knowledge of their cultral, philosophy and of course their techniques. Let me share what I know bit by bit with you people...<br><br>I was learning Hapkido....for around 3yrs...I got my blue belt and was training for my brown tip then...I drop out....for reasons...that many still wonder why...those who trained with me knows.<br><br>Hapkido, though as KTE has menitoned ends with "do"....is not as peaceful as it sounds to be. Many people mistaken this art to be a very self defensive art....as it's name is similar to Akido, and it's chinese translation being totally the same. But in actual fact hapkido is a total training of the mind and the body. We do not initiate conflict...but once we start....we do not stop. The emphasis of hapkido is on kicks...and I dare say the kicks executed are more deadly than the local taekwando clubs. We train ourself to kick with knife edge for our sidekicks...for those who knows what a knife edge means you know how much more powerful it is. And we train to aim for the necks. The turning kick(my favourite execution kick) is kicked with point kicking, meaning we do not merely slap  your face with our kicks. We point our feet so that only the toes hits you...now you might think that it is nothing....but think of your toe as a needle in this case...for all the power of one kick is focus on one point...imagine this kick going to the side of your skull....if you are good...you would be able to get a straight concussion most of the time. We also learn alot of types of "yapsu"...in english it is called the roundhouse kick. We have "uyapsu", "yapsu", "juyapsu" and "honyapsu" and they meant jumping roundhouse, roundhouse, the roundhouse legsweep, amd the reverse roundhouse respectively.<br><br>In hapkido...we allow the use of elbows and knees....totally uncensored unlike the local taekwnado scene...which is very different from that in Korea. And basically we are taught weak points on the body to strike at....and a lot of it are actually fatality points. E.g solar plexis...the throat...spine...nose(yes it can be fatal.) We have a special type of upper cut specifically targeted at the nose....we use our palm to execute it...the baisc idea is to break your nose bone...and push it up wards....breaking it into the brain....thus resulting in a fatality.<br><br>Hapkido is not only about contact sparring solely. We also specalised in locks and holds. A lot of disarming tactics....was a simple handshake...I can disarm your hand totally...rendering it weak and useless in a matter of seconds....and a twist of my hand...yes from a handshake. Breaking of specific joints and dislocation are also taught. Just note that dislocation and breaking of bones are 2 total different matters altogether.<br><br>There is also study on the focus of strenght with the use of breathing....and we train that by meditation....yes...it will most probably sound funny to you people who do not beleive in it....but it is the basic principals of breathing.....the knowledge of it. What you basically do is to sit down.....and you concentrate on your breathing pattern. And by understanding it...you try to control it...and change your breathing patterns so much so that it goes accordance to your execution of techniques.<br><br>This is an art which if I am not wrong is not very popular in singapore...there are only one or 2 places where it is taught locally, it was not like that last time...it was banned for a while due to it's violent nature. And was only allowed to come back recently after a revision to the technique taught locally. I did not check them out...but I heard the version now is very waterdowned.<br><br>I shall write on another marital art that I know about when I have the time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Though me have been learning TKD for abt 3 yearz liaoz and though me have a black belt now, but probably itz the rash and hotheaded nature tat I was before tat probably caused my Master to freak out on me. Till now (I haven't been practising for nearly 5 yearz now) though I still memorize the basic strokez and some of the weak pointz of the human body, whenever I am challenged (like during my BMT dayz when there are lotsa hooliganz in my platoon who love to pick on those seemingly weaker fellaz) I dun have the heart to whack them.<br><br>Though my Master has never taught us killing blows and forbid us to learn, I've picked up some of the killing styles used in other martial arts, but prob due to my nature now, I'd rather otherz whack me then I whack otherz.<br><br>Speared thrust to the Adamz Apple (definitely die if enuf force exerted)<br><br>This is one of the many techniquez I know, USE WIF CAUTION!!!!<br><br>-------------------------<br>A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defence, never for attack - Yoda</div>
