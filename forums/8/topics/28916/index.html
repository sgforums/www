            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by www:<br><strong><br><br>hehe. for guys, can i further complicate the issue?<br><br>joho, what would your decision be, considering the following circumstances:<br><br>1. you are no longer a bachelor<br>2. you met this [b]other</strong> girl who is better than your current girlfriend. to put it bluntly, the both of you simply click better<br>3. this <strong>other</strong> girl has given you the hint that is as good as saying, <span style="font-style: italic;">hey, i wanna be your girlfriend</span><br>[/b]</blockquote>wah lau boss... i super shack this week at work and u whack me like that... muz make sure u naked run around more man! ehehhe<br><br>ok here goes..<br><br>The only problem i need to really clarify is the method of "rating" the girls, becos u mentioned that the 2nd girl is better. But for simplicity's sake let's just take it at face value.<br><br>For starters, i believe that when i'm happily attached there is a distinct line drawn between female friends of mine, ESPECIALLY new acquaintances. Old frens aren't really a problem becos i'd already known them long enuff to know that they are just good as frens and vice versa. Anyway, you mentioned that i met this girl, so it implies that i only met her after i was with my gf.<br><br>So hopefully, I wouldn't wanna fall in such a situation becos the line is there. Of course humans aren't infallible so if i'm unlucky (or lucky for some?) to fall into this situation i would keep telling myself that my fate is sealed with my present gf. i am in a happy reln (we assume) and my gf has done "nothing wrong" and i still love her so why jeopardise a relationship that we've worked hard for together?<br><br>I don't believe i've been in such a situation before, so this is mainly wat i believe i would do, not wat i have actually done or been thru.<br><br>that is why i mentioned above that i will keep telling myself that contemplating a reln with the new gal is out of the question. there is another reason why i believe this is the way to go. i guess we could call it "the grass is greener attitude". humans are never satisfied, they may be happy, but if something seems to be able to make us happier then we are tempted to go for it leaving behind wat is and HAS been making us happy. we are risking something certain for something uncertain but boasts higher rewards. it's like a gamble. 10 bux in my hand is certain to feed me well and i'd be satisfied at a kopitiam when i'm hungry. however if i could gamble that 10 bux to get 20 i would be able to dine at cafe cartel in aircon comfort. then, there is a chance that i might lose my lunch altogether.<br><br>the above reasoning, coupled with another uncertainty of how you would rate the girls is simply not enuff for me to give up something i am happy and certain with.<br><br>i dunno if i've made sense, but the above is wat i would keep telling myself if i were ever in that situation. it may seem to be a politically correct answer, and stiff as it may sound, i'd wanna do the right thing, by my gf definitely, and most likely by myself too.<br><br>one could obvioulsy argue that if i chose to "gamble" with the new girl (hurting the present girl) i could be happier then i ever expected. but no one's ever gonna be able to tell me that with certainty.<br><br>i think it's a matter of how i wanna see the situation. do i wanna keep thinking "wat if....?" with the new girl and feel sorree for myself that i "missed out" or do i wanna be ever so thankful for the wonderful girl i already have by my side. it's how i wanna focus my thoughts, and that is probably the first step into the path i would eventually take.</div>
