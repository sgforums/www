I can't speak for all the girls and you can't pass your judgement on MOST gals...maybe cuz I have only been to Spore once and have yet to see how the girls there behave.<br><br>As for me, I will dress as I please.  Not to suit the desire of men, but simply to feel good about myself.  If you have it, flaut it! hahahahha but when I wear less, I will make sure I am very cafeful of my actions.<br><br>shadeofgrey...<br><br>No, I don't expect you to run down the street like some psycho.  kekekekeee...but I would appreicate it if you would defend the girls here... =P  Not all girls are like that you know...<br><br>Maybe the topic was a bit misleading?!  The word "flirt" is really not correct.  It's more like "slut"  Am I rt?<br><br>------------------<br>Float like a butterfly...Sting like a bee...</div>
