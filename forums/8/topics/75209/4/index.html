            <div class='col-md body'>hey hey... wow.. didnt noe this became like a racist topic.. i wasn't referring that INDIAN workers are sex-hungry in particular or wat; and apologies towards coming to fast conclusions that those indian workers are bangladeshies..... but anyway i was just sharing wif everyone wat i happened to see.<br><br>Anyway i did add on, that any other ppl can do that, juz that those ppl on the lorries were really in a big group. Any ah peks, any man, can get easily excited and go goo-goo upon seeing any girl they find is attractive.<br><br>and I am definitely not jealous or wat over them not looking at me. Hmm.. In fact I thank god they did not. or else i will do something disgusting like dig my nose and throw my nose sh*t in their direction to put them off. Regardless of wat race or age the man/men is/are, I will do that.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Anyway, I think it is not so nice if my topic sparked off a racial disagreement among all. Anyway if u want others to be nice towards u n ppl of ur own race, put forth a frenly attitude towards them first. Or else, I think the more u condemn and voice ur frustrations, the more others may get worked up and start developing racist feelihgs towards ur own race. hmmm... watever.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> hmm i thot i heard someone said some women dress scantily and subject themselves to such kinds of stares. alrite.. some women do like the attention ahowered upon them, BUT not all. can't these "curious men" not stare at these women with the kinda never-see-women before looks? anyway <strong>it is ok to glance at ppl, but i have heard my elders teach before, that it is RUDE TO STARE.</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Honeybunz:</div><div class="quote_body">Why they look hungrily at women?<br><br>Nothing to do with where they come from<br>Nothing to do with their race<br>Nothing to do with their gender.<br><br>Very simple.  They are here, away from home.  Away from girlfriend, wives, friends.  They are lonely.  That's all.<br><br>Likewise, maids sometime do fall in love very easily here.</div></blockquote>At last, someone who's enlightened.<br><br>People here have it much better than others in neighbouring countries.  And it's given them a complex that makes them look down on all those they perceive as doing lowly, menial jobs, like the Filipina maids and the Bangladeshi workers, or those from countries formally thought of as backward, like China.<br><br>Unbeknownst to many, some of our foreign workers are actually highly educated people, whose only misfortune is that they can't get jobs back home, or ones that pay them their due.  And for those who are uneducated, how is this their fault?  Unlike us, many people around the world do not have the privilege of education, like we do.<br><br>Hence, they leave family and friends and home behind in search of a better future.  And then they come here and people treat them like scum.  Why is that?  They're contributing to the Singapore economy and society, and doing the jobs that we snub our noses at.  And for lousy wages and lousy treatment at that.<br><br>Inspite of all our personal problems, Singaporeans are generally a privileged lot.  Let's not pretend that it gives us a right to behave like a bunch of snobs.<br></div>
