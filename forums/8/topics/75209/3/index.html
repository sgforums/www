            <div class='col-md body'>Honestly, I think the Bangla workers are pretty harmless. They will look but they won't do anything. They are also much more courteous then other foreign workers. I see they will give their seats to disabled people, pregnant women old people in the trains or bus one. Very spontaneous. Where as the China ones can't be bothered too. Also they may seem weird at times but I think it's because of the cultural difference. For them you see they can walk around and hold hands sia with their brother brother. I think China workers are more dangerous sia. A lot of times the crimes if commited by foreigner is China one somemore. It's not a race thing, more like a culture thing.</div>
