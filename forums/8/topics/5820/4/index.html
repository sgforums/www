In a class of its own....I am no match for such an intelligent sec school boy like u who looks like he's gonna make it to poly (WOW what an achievement!). U are definitely in the top 99.999% of the amoeba population in terms of intelligence. As for me, *sigh* can only make it to one of the top unis in USA....pale in comparison to u lar.<br><br>MoronNg: Don't understand why u view my comments as "insults" to u. Well the fact is u are really dumb so I was just being objective. Sad that u are taking it so personally.<br><br>So what happened to ur high talk about Econs ah? heh....empty vessel still wanna discuss Econs ah? Reminds me of a garang guni attempting to discuss solutions to hyperinflation in Brazil.<br><br>--"Oooooo I did think of that possibility but that would be thinking of you too highly that someone would actually want to ban you."--<br>Fwah sooooo smart ah? But very strangely, u only "think" of them AFTER someone else has mentioned it. Dunno why leh...heh. This is exactly the kind of thing a person of ur level would do lah....cannot blame.<br><br>Oh and i guess it's beyond ur ability to recognise the fact that i don't really care if I'm wanted here or not. But then again, I don't suppose a 2 year old kid can do that too so don't worry too much abt it, u're at worst at the same level as a toddler.<br><br>Prodigal and Dangerguy: wow the both of u must be the professional cock-suckers from thailand. welcome to singapore.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[QUOTE]Originally posted by bochup:<br>Kaiser, I must say something... I respect you for your knowledge shown in the old threads, but would it be ok if you not flame people?<br><br>Well I am glad that finally there is someone here who says something sane.<br><br>As far as I can recall the whole issue started with NgKaiHoe's economics thread. I believe the freedom of speech in this board allows for Kaiser to condemn Ng's views as he deems fit. NgKaihHoe displayed displeasure at Kaiser's criticism and he replied as he deemed fit, and at that point in time, I dare say things were still pretty civil.<br><br>The problem lies in the fact that apparently many of the people in here know KaiHoe in person. Now that it seems to me that KaiHoe has let the matter past, many of this people, who to me are pretty juvenile, are still jumping at the chance to 'flame' Kaiser.<br><br>I understand that it's nice to have a public enemy around, but I must say that many of the replies to Kaiser have been largely of a very low standard, in terms of substantiation. They are very often baseless attacks that have ultimately degenerated into crude stuff like jamming cocks into throats, which to me only salamanders are capable of.<br><br>I read with amusement Kaiser's replies, which might be a little overboard, but nonetheless drives home the message that he cannot be very bothered with the juveniles here, who have not so much a clue as to what they are arguing about, except that they must hop on the bandwagon to strike at the 'public enemy'.<br><br>Undoubtly there will be replies to what I just wrote but I hope they will be of some substance instead of senseless accusations that I am Kaiser etc...<br><br>That's all I have to say for now.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>what I believe is that everyone shd try to be  as diplomatic as possible when criticizing people, so as to maintain the sanity of the thread. You know, when people get heated up, they tend to start personal attacks.<br><br>During earlier days, I read Kaizer's post seriously, until he become a flamer, then I stop reading his post... sometimes get tired reading all these nonsense...<br><br>anyway, what I can say is that I know most of Kaizer's flamers personally, and they are very pleasant people to be with... whether their postings are "chim" or not is not a very important consideration.<br><br>As for people I dunno, like terence, Prodigal, Rinoa and last time before I know firewire, and of course the old Kaizer, I always look out for their postings becos they always offer something new, or some thought provoking sentences which I can dwell on for some time(and hopefully in the process improve myself)...<br><br>I know the ties between Kaizer and the rest are too bad beyond cure, and I won't attempt to do the impossible here(or like asif I care much).

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh yeah I do remember the "extend the friendship" part. It goes something like this "ok lah we come out for a cup of coffee and talk it over" followed by a friendly line to end his post that runs along the line of "mebbe u might grow some brains" or something to that effect. So Stupit, what kinda erm.....extension of goodwill is this? U just gotta recognise how firewire farts thru his mouth. Well how about this? Eh MoronNg, come lah i treat u to a stick of satay so mebbe u would stop pouting like a sick toad. Grow up leh, 26/27 yrs old already leh!<br><br>Oh and not to mention the time when firewire started his shit about Kaiser and the Aryan race HAHAHAHA!!!! Gosh gimme a break. Poor fool can't tell the difference between a nickname and the real thing. And in case u don't know Stupit, all this is coming from someone above 25 years old!!! Amazing huh?<br><br>Oh and by the way, I didn't come back with a different nick. I think anyone with an IQ of 50 and above can see they are all the same person. It has always been Kaiser.<br><br>And yeah u are right Stupit, there's quite a number of people of sub-standard species here like Dakar and Eck.<br><br>This started with MoronNg trying real hard to act smart, talking about Econs. Think I have given several reasons to substantiate my point and that he asked a really dumb question in his Econs thread. Up till now, MoronNg has only managed to digress and talk about Taoism, or flame Shaolin Boy more than 80% of the time. And when his original question was challenged, he would just worm his way around, trying hard to rephrase things etc. How lame can one get? My point is, if u know shit about Econs or anything else for that matter, don't act smart! He is definitely more suited to discuss the contents of his other thread where he asked something like "if a girl wants to have sex with u but u do not want to entertain her, what should u do?" That is the kinda of topics someone of his standards should deliberate over.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>bochup: The fact is, MoronNg here really wants to show off, prob reading from textbooks in his laps at home, trying to impress people here by talking about some intellectual topics such as Econs when he really knows shit about it. hahah did u hear him talk about Adam Smith??? So if he had taken the initiative to be this stupid, u can't blame me for telling him to cut the act. Wonder if u see the causal and effect relationship here. I didn't come out of the blue to flame him without rhyme or reason. The serious flaming started with MoronNg aka PoseurNg when he got furious after his act was exposed.<br><br>People who associate me with GBM do not have the ability to tell the difference in standards apart due to their inferior mental faculty or lack of a good formal education. I don't see the point of engaging in euphemism here lest these poor kids do not get the message. It is unfortunate and sympathies go out to this group of wretched miserables.<br><br>Lastly, u sound (and look) like the nice guy type of person to me. It wouldn't be nice if we were to end up flaming each other so thanks for the advice but do stay out of it. Your life goes on and so do many of the other "more constructive" discussions.</div>

What I must clarify is that I'm not really that nice, and that I didn't flame you becos I respect your intellectual standard. Just see how I flame ShaoLinBoy/GBM...<br><br>But I really hate to see the flaming going on between you and my frens. So can everyone stop this flaming and get on with normal psotings?<br><br>Not that I really care lah... but at least I can say I tried to stop this...  :p  ha ha ha....<br><br>------------------<br>Whens the end coming?

            <div class='col-md body'>Kaiser:<br>You been think twice before "degrading people" for nothing. I have not seen any friendly posting from you, other than those who has join in the flaming game.<br><br>If you really think that you are so great, been highly education, I guess I pity your parents and whoever is giving you the education. Being "highly educated" and go around flaming people is not the way of life! Get a fuck man! I'm sure you know you are not welcome here and still wants to come back here and throw in all your flames. What for? I think you must have study too much that you think with your ass. Your parents dun pay for your education to go around flaming people.<br><br>Nay, waste my time typing all these to say to you! Yeah, I am "lowly education" and not "as intelligent as" you...I shall say "YOU MOTHER GIVE BIRTH TO A PUPPY IS BETTER THAN HAVING YOU"!<br><br>What a waste of my energy and time....dun bother abt the K ass....<br><br>------------------<br>why, bishamon? why bish?<br>coz he's God of War!!<br>But I'm a peacelover! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Uhh kaiser....In case you forgot or couldn't read properly, I did extend a hand of friendship to you.  It was onli after you flamed me twice or thrice over (and my family also)that I decided to start flaming you in earnest.  In fact your words were that  you thought i was just trying to lure you out so that I could kick your ass, which was and is totally untrue (as people who know me here can attest to...i'm just not that type).<br><br>So i'm truly sorryt hat you didn't want to accept our hand of friendship.  Just don't blame it on us for not trying because as Bishamon has said already...You haven't said one friendly thing to anyone before.<br><br>And yes i do know the difference between new nick and old nick.<br><br>You originally came under the nick: KAISER<br><br>then you dissappeared and came back under: KAISERII<br><br>Then : Kaiiser or some crap like that.  hey if it was the same nick it would still be KAISER and not KAISERR or KAISSER or KAIISER or KAISERII...<br><br>the statement about not knowing what the difference between nciks is more relevent to you than to me because i already know the diff.<br><br>HEY&gt;&gt;&gt;BISH...CALM DOWN BIG GUY&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Breath....breath.....it's ok man...:-)</div>
