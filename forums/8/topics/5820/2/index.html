            <div class='col-md body'>Alright so what is this shit about knowing a person only after u've met him? Calls into question which is the TRUE personality ....the person in real life or here behind the screen? Think it can easily be argued both ways.....guys who think MoronNg is a much nicer guy just cuz u've met in real life might wanna rethink this. U sure that's the real him instead?</div>
