            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">GEMINI MAN</span></strong><br><br>A man in this Zodiac has a thin long &amp; proportional face. He has a high forehead &amp; very clever. He looks like he cannot stand or sit still, a very fast person. His nose is just right in size, thin lips, talk fast &amp; very talkative. He can think faster than he talks, but once he start talking, he will talk non stop as if god has gifted him with that special talk machine mouth. He likes to cut his hair short &amp; he is very athletic. He is tall &amp; slim &amp; every movement of his is "Fast" or nearly call "Hyperactive". He has long fingers &amp; always tap on the table or likes moving his finger as if he is trying to grab something. He is the type who will write or scribble on paper, he never stays still. His hair is always well-combed or neat. He will spend a long time to comb his hair. He will keep his manicure &amp; pedicure clean. He is a well dressed &amp; clean guy, so if u like cleanliness, u will love him. He will keep all his clothes in big closet, &amp; never throw them away even those shirts he never wears anymore, but yet he still keep buying new clothes &amp; make sure he is in style. He knows how to dress well even with a low budget. He gets bored easily with his favorite clothes, cologne. He is very picky, so soap &amp; his cologne have to be in the same trend or same scent. If u date this kind of guy, u might think u are dating 2 guys, u will have to guess his feelings &amp; emotions. Is he doing things because it is a duty, or is it because he wants to? He changes his mind as fast as he changes a new pair of shoes. He can pick up a book &amp; roughly read through &amp; understand its contents, so if u see a Gemini man who reads the whole book, then he must be influenced by other Zodiac. He hates to set fixed schedule, &amp; dislikes boring routine job. He could hardly be on time, &amp; can only keeps time if it is completely important &amp; necessary. He doesn't come late because he forgets, but because he always finds other attractions along the way. He likes to act opposite to what he wants to do. He is a very good speaker &amp; makes a very good politician. He can easily persuade other people &amp; presents himself well in public, a real charmer. If he is a writer, he will write the best seller. He always searches for truth &amp; constantly studies himself. He's never satisfied about his fame, his reputation or money, because he thinks he deserved more. He will keep searching even if he is not sure what is his ultimate satisfaction. Woman in love normally wants to feel secure &amp; stable, but if u fall in love with this guy, be prepared to be alone. He will come to see u when he feels like it. He won't even know how he spent his days everyday, so adjusts yourself if u love him. Dating him is like dating 2 guys, so today he can tell u how much he loves u, but tomorrow he might call u to cancel your date. When he's upset, he could tell u that he hates your dress, even if it is the same dress he used to comment that it makes u look very sexy. Do not ask him why as that's the way for him when he won't have any explanations too. When he is back to his normal mood, he will take u out again &amp; forget what just happened. U can't expect him to be the same person now, &amp; forever. His changes will depend on u, for better or for worst. If u like to take risk &amp; dare for challenges, u will get along with him fine. He keeps his emotions secretly as if he's hiding it, so u will not be able to tell if he's crazy in love with u, or does not give a damn at all, but be calm &amp; patient. He will never leave u if he thinks u are a puzzle, then he will spend time solving it.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">GEMINI WOMAN</span></strong><br><br>A good-looking woman with brains, a very interesting person. She has fast movements &amp; she could not sit still or stand still for long. She is able to do many things at the same time &amp; at a fast pace. If u date her, u will feel like dating many women at the same time. U can't tie her down with the word "Love" because she cares about love but it is not a major factor of her life. U have to be able to adjust yourself to get along with her varying characters. She is a dreamer &amp; has many dreams. She's eager to learn new things all the time. Even if she is the 2 in 1 mixed character type, she is quite lucky in love. U have to put all your efforts to win her affection. Even when she likes u &amp; wonders about your wit, she will also see &amp; inspect your bad side at the same time, because it is in her nature. She's able to keep all kinds of mixed emotions without annoying u or letting u know at all. She can cheer u up by acting like a free little bird. Her conversation will not bored u. She's able to talk to u in any subjects. She can make u feel like u are the luckiest man alive.

She can join all your activities with the same energy that u have. She is quick-witted &amp; learn new things very fast. She can see your projects &amp; she can give u good advice. If she thinks u are not sure that u want her for yourself, she will act like your best friend only, a cool woman. She can make a guy fall in love with her easily. Her multiple changes &amp; moods is a "Charm" for many men. She can be laughing for 2 minutes &amp; later suddenly becomes quiet. She wants to find only 1 true love &amp; hopes to meet her dream guy. She expects a lot &amp; nearly too much. She is constantly waiting for her knight shinning armor even when she's with a steady boyfriend. She can fall in love or be fond of someone else while she is with u. If u break up with her, she will forget u quite fast, because changes is her nature. The Gemini woman breaks more hearts than any woman in other Zodiac. Because she is a dreamer &amp; is always waiting for her knight shinning armor, so her love life can be complex or a mess. She hates to write a long letter, so if u write her a letter &amp; expect a prompt reply, forget it. Because she has a multiple personality with multiple ideas, so she hates to put them down in written proof. Because she believes that today can be different from tomorrow. She could communicate with more than 1 language, a real gifted linguistic. If she wants to tell u any bad comments, she won't say it straightaway, but she will talk to u about many other things &amp; accidentally come to that subject without offending u. Normally she will not lie. She will work hard &amp; once a while take a long rest. She can get bored &amp; tired with her own surroundings more than at work. She never feel contented with her present work, money, or reputations, she will strive to have more. Don't ask her what is her ultimate contentment for she will not have an answer. Once u get to know her, she will be a supportive person &amp; always be beside<br>u. She has a beautiful dream &amp; she loves to have someone walks side by side with her, together &amp; equally.<br></div>
