            <div class='col-md body'>It really pisses me off to see Chinese ppl crawling with inferiority over Ang Mohs. It doubly pisses me off to see SPGS dating one. Why do we have such a complex. You see this all over Asia, they get the best jobs, best housing, benefits..entry to exclusive clubs etc and why.... just because they are Ang Mohs. Look at that ****** Nick Leeson who caused the loss of many Singaporean jobs but has become a celebrity over in UK. If it was an Asian, then he would be strung up.<br>Perhaps Singaporeans should stop crawling and wake up to the 21st century... we r not inferior!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No we are definitely not inferior, but u have to understand that as a developing region, we pay more attention and make more of a fuss over foreign talent than our own because they do have things we do need from them...but that's not to say they are better.<br><br>My final thing to you is that you watch what happens over the next 10 years as Asia becomes more affluent and learns the ways of globalisation...Once we have experience, ang mohs will be treated as any other talent hired from anywhere else...but for now they are the defacto masters of their trade whatever it may be...and it may be true and it may not be but that's how it is viewed at present.<br><br>As for seeing our asian grls going for them...well, u can't compete...they just look more handsome than us...full stop..and more manly. hahahah</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This may not be totally related to the topic, but since the issue of Chinese is raised, I'll just like to say something...<br>I study in NUS, and i dun mean to be criticize.....but there are a lot of China nationals postgraduates in NUS, and somehow, they way they carry themselves off can be quite off-putting. Maybe it's just cultural difference b/w where they come from and singapore, but just think that they should be more sensitive to the pple around them...<br>Many of them shout instead of talk, they dirty the tables when they eat, and somehow lack some mannerism and can be very rowdy at times. anyone shares my opinion here, especially those who are also from nus?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with sparkle about the Chinese nationals studying in NUS. Don't mean to be against them or anything but even some lecturers can feel the same way about them. Saw a guy from China (a postgrad) adjusting his silk STOCKINGS at the staircase outside the library. Probably his personal preference or share with his wife but....arghhhhhh<br>Tried to justify their behavior by telling myself that it is just their way of living and style but still cannot take it graciously.<br>Am I too narrow minded and shallow?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mr Bengboy,<br><br>Actually, those girls who prefer Ang Moh men are in the minority.. it's just that ppl prob take more notice; I mean they even have a tag; SPGs! So of course they are more 'emphasized'. I know most Singaporean girls (cannot say for rest of Asia) prefer their own race. So quit the jealousy eh...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Anyway, Firewire is rite. Ang Mohs generally look better than chinese.. they got their high cheekbones and sharp noses. They look good in long hair, short hair, skinhead.. sigh...<br><br>Just be happy being yourself, whether tall, thin, short, fat, Chinese or otherwise...<br><br>Cheerios.<br><br>------------------<br>Is it cold in here, or is it just me?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, I know what you mean with the Chinese undergrads......some of them really cannot make it. Then again, I got Chinese friends who have adapted pretty well, and are no different from Singaporeans in the way they behave now. I think it is up to the Chinese to learn to adapt to us, cause they are in a foreign land, and "When in Rome, do as the Romans do". And they should definitely change with regards to the table manners part.<br><br>I don't feel that Asians have an inferior complex, at least, not anymore. Why you see foreigners being fawned over in Singapore is because most of the time, when we employ expats over here to work, they are most of the time cream of the crop, and they are very well qualified to hold high positions. I guess that if you go to Western countries, and meet with Asian holding high positions there, the situation will be reversed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agree with Turtle: Adapt &amp; also cream of the crop.<br><br>To a certain extend, money(rich countries), power &amp; developed nations also plays an important part. We tend to look upon it as great &amp; a certain respect to it. The poorer countries tends to suffer from it. Singapore is considered as not too bad compared to many other nations. Japan(in Asia) is one of the better one, most are proud to be one.<br><br>As for SPG, looks &amp; treatment is different. So is their rights to chose.<br><br>It's the culture, facts of life &amp; how u perceived.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well.. maybe because of history.<br>but then again... we see English as the "right language" so as long you speak it well.. ppl will look you up. (my opinion)<br><br>That's why ang mohs get so much attention. just take a chinese who is born in US/Canada/UK. They come to singapore, speak bombastic english... all eyes would look at this particular person and one would think "good english, surely not local".<br><br>As for ang mohs haaving tops jobs. That's a sad case. Many big companies here are MNCs. and MNCs tend to send their own ppl to oversee the operations. And if they enter Singapore with expatriate status, they get sponsored housing, paid children education, allowances, locally matched car price (they only pay for what they would back home), and many other +++.<br><br>Even the Sg govt gives them tax breaks.<br><br>sigh... moreover.. with reservist nonsense, MNCs are now looking more on regional talent than locals.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't really agree with the part where Asians feel inferior to Caucasians. I mean, there was a survey about how many people would like to be somebody of a different race if they could.... maybe that reflects on how much they want to be of another race... but, it does not mean they feel inferior. Besides, I think inferiority would be decided on a personal basis. Yeah, for example... like in olden times, India had the caste systems. People were segregated... and they were treated according to their castes. These castes obviously not evolve from thin air. They were decided by men. People in the lower castes were seen as inferior... Are they really inferior in that sense?<br><br>As in the case of SPGs, I wonder who came uo with that? I mean, you can't label every girl who is dating an Angmoh, or like Angmohs... as SPGs. It could be purely by chance... not that the girl goes to look for one.<br><br>Yeah, I think... sometimes... some Chinese girls may prefer Indian guys... or Malay guys like Chinese girls.. Is this considered feeling inferior? So, I think the same can be said for gals liking Angmohs. In fact, you have Chinese guys drooling at Caucasian babes.. but you dun have Sarong Party Guy??</div>
