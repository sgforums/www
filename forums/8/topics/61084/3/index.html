Prior to slaughtering or before confirming its death, no body part of the animals shall be cut or mutilated.<br><br>(iii) No injury shall be inflicted on the animalÂ’s nervous system, brain or spinal cord prior to slaughtering. Shooting a bullet in the head, captive bolt, hammering the head to stun, electric shocks, stunning by carbon dioxide, and such procedures before slaughtering are questionable and thus subject to Ijtihad[1].<br><br>The question is: Â“If no injury can be inflicted on the animal to be slaughtered, what about stunning? Will it render the resulting meat (upon slaughter) Halal in the eyes of the Syariah?Â”<br><br>Desensitisation, or stunning, of the subject before slaughter remains a debatable issue. However, most Islamic scholars have come to terms and agreed that stunning is acceptable and thus the meat is Halal for Muslim consumption (Jufri, 1991). There are a number of forms of stunning and in some forms, the animal will remain unharmed and can actually get up and walk away a few minutes later if it is not slaughtered (Chaudry, 1990). Furthermore, stunning is an effective mass production technique that provides a means of controlling the slaughter more precisely, thereby avoiding undue stress to the animal and the slaughterman.<br><br>(iv) The animals shall be free from diseases and anabolic hormones such as the female sex hormone, and diethyl-stylbesterol (DES) treatment.<br><br>(B) Islamic Belief<br><br>Muslims believe that all creatures are AllahÂ’s creation and that they are taking the lives of healthy animals by the permission of Allah. They also believe that the killing of animals is solely for useful purposes like eating (e.g. meat) or drinking (e.g. cowÂ’s milk).<br><br>During the act of slaughtering, these 3 criteria have to be met:<br><br>(i) The slaughterer must be a sane Muslim male or female. This is to ensure the validity of intention of immolation to Allah. In Islam, for any worship to be considered valid and accepted by Allah, that act or worship has to be coupled with good intention and determination. The slaughtering of animal is no exception. Thus, the slaughterer must be sane to carry out the process of slaughter after making due intention.<br><br>(ii) The animal may preferably be faced towards the KaÂ’bah[2] before slaughtering.<br><br>(iii) The name of Allah has to be invoked on the animal to be slaughtered as follows:<br><br>Â“Bismillah, Allahu AkbarÂ”<br><br>(In the name of Allah; Allah is the Greatest)<br><br>In the case of manual slaughter, such invocation should be made immediately before the slaughtering of each animal. However, for the slaughtering of poultry using mechanical means, the Muslim slaughterman shall recite the phrase prior to switching on the mechanical knife[3] (Halaalan Thoyyiba Global StandardCM, 2001). </span></div>
