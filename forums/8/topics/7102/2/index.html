The discussions that have been held between all<br>parties failed to reach an agreement as to the extent of these tests and, as a result of<br>these differences in opinion, we cannot proceed at the present time.<br><br>"Manchester United wish Ruud every success with his rehabilitation programme and will<br>continue to monitor the situation very closely in order to achieve our desire to make him<br>a Manchester United player."<br><br>PSV chairman Harry van Raaij has already revealed that the deal is is unlikely to go<br>through before the start of next season, and that it is indeed disagreements over the<br>fitness tests that has caused the move to collapse.<br><br>Speculative Italian newspaper reports have linked Milan with a counter-bid for the<br>Dutchman, although Roma have already officially denied that they are looking to make an<br>offer for the player.<br><br>"We weren't interested in van Nistelrooy before United bought him, and we're not<br>interested in him now they haven't," stated Roma president Franco Sensi. "He's not a<br>player you can buy as a reserve and, anyway, if United don't want him, there must be<br>something wrong with his knee."<br><br>The next step is unknown - will United be able to assess their potential signing's<br>performance in the European Championships, before deciding whether to revive the<br>transfer, or could van Nistelrooy be destined for another season in Holland?<br><br>What is for certain is that the whole affair has been a huge embarrassment to United.<br>The declaration of intent will have unsettled the likes of Andy Cole, and, to a lesser<br>extent, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Teddy Sheringham, and it has seemingly widened the<br>rift between Martin Edwards and Sir Alex Ferguson.<br><br>------------------<br>Masturbated once and fucked twice - Story of Man United against Real Madrid</div>
