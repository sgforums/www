            <div class='col-md body'>For a start, I hope that there will be no flames here. Intellectual discussions on the topic. Hate-posts are quite pointless.<br><br>Let's face it. Man U can't have 5 strikers. Even ignoring the question of the wage bill, how on earth are u going to keep them happy and sharp? Strikers need matches to stay sharp, to keep the goal-scoring instinct.<br><br>Let's look at the current 4 strikers.<br><br>Andy Cole. Fast. Good first touch. Quick on the turn. Can't hold the ball up. Misses too many chances. Can shoot outside the box. Out and out striker.<br><br>Dwight Yorke. Fast. Holds up the ball well. Very good at scoring once in the box. Can't score long range. Weak in the air. Can play a holding position behind the front men.<br><br>Ole Gunnar Solsjkaer. Powerful shot. Very accurate shooter. Good at off the ball running. The striker in the squad which misses the least chances. Out and out striker.<br><br>Teddy Sheringham. Very good at holding up the ball and passing to other players in good positions. Best at playing just behind the front men. Not fast. Old. More of a provider than a scorer.<br><br>So, let's look at Ruud van Nistelrooy.<br>23. Powerful shot. Strong in the air. Quite fast. Ability to put chances away. Good with both feet.<br><br>I would probably sell Andy Cole. He's contributed greatly to Man U in the past 2 years. I feel sorry to let him go. He'll be a threat in other teams. However, Cole has a big problem. He needs pple to get the ball to him. Once the ball doesn't get to him, he's useless. Moreover his defensive qualities are ZERO. Yorke can defend. Solsjkaer can win the ball in midfield. Sheringham as well. Cole is just a scorer, if he puts the chance away that is. True, he has class and ability. Still, letting him go would be the safest as I feel that out of the 4 of them, he's the one who can most easily be cut off. So he won't pose too much of a problem when he faces Man U in the future.<br><br>I would sell Cole to Tottenham to get them to sell Sol Campbell over. Ronny Johnsen is back. Wes Brown will be soon. Next season, the defence will be more stable.<br><br>Man U's attack's fine. The midfield can't be better. Once the defence is shored up, things will be fine.<br><br>Of course, assuming Ruud passes his medical tests the second time round....<br><br>[This message has been edited by Altrex (edited 26 April 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, 5 strikers is indeed to much....so Teddy is leaving, we should bring one to replace him...but 19m pounds for Van Nistelrooy is just too much!!! not proven in international stage, moreover Dutch league sucks!!!! Maybe should buy Salas as Lazio is sure to clear itssquad to raise money for purchase of Rivaldo...<br>Sell Tahibi, Berg to finance part of purchase of Campbell...<br>Buy Suvillian on a free tansfer from Wimbeldon to give that Assuie a fight for keeper place...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well....coincidence, my opinions were formed by watching Man U matches and observing the players, but i suppose that my analysis is not unique.<br><br>Taibi is on loan. his ITC is still with Man U.<br><br>yah...Teddy is the oldest of them all. However, he has something the rest don't have. He has the ability to be a playmaker behind the front men. Hold the ball up and pass it around. Think Cantona. Since he left, who else can do it? Teddy isn't as good as Cantona at doing it, but he's the best in Man U's squad right now.<br><br>Look at the rest. Keane can't do it. He lacks the flair. He's a ballwinner who's not particularly noted for intelligent passes. Scholes is a attacking midfielder who does more on the ball than off the ball. Scholes doesn't have a tendency to pass around. He just moves forward. Butt doesn't have what it takes.<br><br>Sometimes, you just need a key person behind the front men. This is Teddy's biggest strength. He was never an out and out striker. Even in Euro '96. He was the provider to Shearer.<br><br>Anyway, I have no concrete opinions on the keeper problem. Agility and shot-stopping wise, Bossie's damn good. However, he's too small. One of the best things about Peter was the fact that he's big. Van der Gouw is tall as well, though not as fast as Bossie.<br><br>Look at the first Raul goal (2nd Real goal)last week. I would bet that Peter could have saved it. Bossie might not reach the ball as his arms are probably not long enough.<br><br>Anyway, Man U's real problem is defence. Sol's probably the only one I can think of now, but ideally, Man U needs a libero. Like the Kaiser in his heyday. Someone who besides defending with Jaap Stam, can start an attack with a solid incisive pass.<br><br>Actually, the smartest way to stop Man U now as Real showed is to use a human wall and cut off the front men. Give them no space to move. In the second half, Scholes, Yorke and the rest were all sandwiched and they lost the ball.<br><br>To succeed, Man U has to solve this problem.<br><br>Likewise, for any team to succeed. Tight defence, flowing passing, quick counter-attack and ability to shoot from outside the box.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Andy Cole. He looks like a good goalscorer only because he gets presented many chances (whoever can't score from some of all the crosses from Giggs and Beckham, might as well don't play in Premier League) and anyone who works with Yorke will look good. Even Jason Lee(the pineapple head NottingHam Forest Striker last time). hehe<br>I've always thought he was overrated. Solskjaer, Sheringham and Yorke may be slower than him off the sprint but in the modern game speed isn't everything..it's timing and postitional sense. And Cole doesn't have that. And he's already 29 so before he hits 30, sell him off at a profit since Aston Villa(hahah) is willing to pay a lot for him.<br><br>[This message has been edited by theychosenone (edited 26 April 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>u pple should read thenews in soccernet:<br>1) Man Utd selling Cole to Fiorentina, part exhange with Toldo... Batistuta going to Inter Milan..so Bosnich may be moving away..<br>2) Solsjaker a target for many teams. but maybe selling him to spurs for part exchange with campbell...<br>3) Teddy &amp; Cruffy sure to leave for free transfer..<br>**) If all are true, Man Utd only left with two strikers (Nistrelrooy &amp; Yorke!!!!) How to survive the long season?????</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Cole in Italy would be a good thing, esp since Fiorentina won't be in the Champions League next season.<br><br>Without Batistuta, who has long said that he wouldn't mind leaving Fiorentina (but to Inter?), even with Cole as a replacement, I doubt Fiorentina will be able to be a top team again. Cole needs support. He's not Batistuta. Batigol can shoot from almost anywhere, in and out of the box. He can hold the ball and find the space to shoot. Cole needs the ball to be passed to him. Big diff...<br><br>Toldo would be a good choice as a keeper. As much as Sol is needed in the centre of Man U's defence, I would NEVER sell Solsjkaer. In rejecting a 11 million pound bid, Man U showed their seriously in keeping Solsjkaer. Hmm...he seems more highly rated than Cole, which wouldn't make me too surprised.<br><br>Taibi only costed 4 million pounds. Getting back the money is not a problem. Anyway, if Bosnish goes to AC Milan, he will cost at around 4 million too.<br><br>Now the interesting thing is what the rest of the clubs in the world would do to counter the new and powerful Man U squad, which would arguably be the most complete in the last 10 years.<br><br>Leeds needs nerve. Liverpool needs very little...maybe for Owen and Fowler to stay uninjured. Arsenal needs a new backline and maybe half a new midfield. Chelsea needs younger players. The rest....well, they need a miracle.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How abt. selling Nicky Butt? Since Ronny Johnsen is back, he can play either midfield or central defence.<br>I would luv 2 c Man U selling Jordi Cruyff. He is such a skillful player n it is a great pity he is not given any chance 2 perform.<br></div>
