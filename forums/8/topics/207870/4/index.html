            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by caramon.:</div><div class="quote_body">Whenever I take taxis in Los Angeles, there is a 95% chance that the cabby is a new immigrant who hardly speaks English - I've taken taxis driven by Russians, Nigerians, Estonians and Romanians. For these new immigrants to USA, driving a taxi is an entry point to something better in life. It is a chance for them to get to know the city better and earn a decent living. I found out by chatting to Los Angeles taxi drivers that they can get by making about 10 trips a day and most of the time work is 6-8 hours a day.<br><br>In Singapore, things are different - all taxi drivers are Singaporeans. Just last week I met 2 taxi drivers with university degrees and one with an MBA - all of them claimed that they were retrenched when their companies hired younger foreign talents to replace them. In Singapore driving a taxi is an alternative when you get retrenched from your job and can't get another job. More than half the earnings of a taxi driver goes to the taxi companies as rental and for fuel. There is no such thing as leave or holidays. A typical taxi driver drives for 10-12 hours a day - there is no medical benefits, no CPF and no pension. Yet you can easily find taxi drivers with a university education and every year the GLC - Comfort Cabs report double digit earnings growth.<br><br>My point is Singaporeans are so lucky to have such well educated cabbies. In other countries, such well educated people would be employed as professionals in various organisations. In Singapore we have numerous foreign talents to help fill those professional positions so that educated Singaporeans can be freed up to work as cabbies. We must try to understand that our country is progressing so much that most cabbies are well educated that is the envy of other countries.</div></blockquote>So Caramon,<br><br>Is the above copy-and-paste also? Or your own writing? Just curious.</div>
