            <div class='col-md body'>My learned friend, I am most happy to know such a guy like you exist. Singaporeans are fussy workers, not only do they want a decent income, they are also unwilling to take up jobs such as driving taxi thus affecting the profitability of big businesses.<br><br>There are some small minded Singaporeans who can't get jobs because of the huge influx of competing labor - please lah, there are still taxis around waiting for hirers in Comfort - so there is no reason to be unhappy. Others are even worse, they complained about the thousands of free scholarships given to foreigners while needy Singaporeans suffer. Can't they see that the govt just wants Singaporeans to be self sufficient especially the poorer ones.<br><br>It is simply strange that Singaporeans cannot understand something that is done for their own good. Therefore it is necessary to allocate more pages in the Straits Times to further explain that all this is done for Singaporean's own good. Once you understand, you will be a happy Singaporean. I hope singaporean make an effort to understand.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by freakass:<br><strong><br><br>YES! I can't agree more! Most Singaporeans are too well protected...

More than half the earnings of a taxi driver goes to the taxi companies as rental and for fuel. There is no such thing as leave or holidays.

For a moment...<br>Really, it's not as drastic as this? Anyway, imagine EPL with only English players. The standard of EPL was raised by the foreigners who has something extra to bring to the audience. I do not strongly agree that we need foreigners to take up our rice bowls, but I think they will help to keep Singapore more competitive than other countries. If we just think about keeping our rice bowls, we will find ourselves behind our neighbouring countries one day. For those graduate taxi drivers, all hope is not lost.

Prove your worth! We aint inferior compared to foreigners! Strive hard!</strong>[/b]</blockquote>Not shut the door totally, limit the numbers of Ft coming to sg. And increase the number of years they have to work in sg. 3 years is really a short time. Most  my china frens say they wish to return to china to get high salaries job. Its the cert they want not the $$.  In that case sg govt just waste OUR $$ proving the Fts with scholarship but after 3 years they head back to them homeland. So does that globalize our country or the other way round?<br><br>Sg govt shall support our local ppl more by give them $$ to study overboard n come back to sg to make it a more advance and develop country.  Rather den supporting those foreign student to study here to work for only 3 short years to find out that they will return to their homeland after the bond.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Can't they see that the govt just wants Singaporeans to be self sufficient especially the poorer ones.<br><br>It is simply strange that Singaporeans cannot understand something that is done for their own good.

            <div class='col-md body'>The low birth rate really must blame LKY, cause last time got disincentive to have children one, say one is enough, two just nice.  My brother almost couldn't study in the same primary school as me last time due the disincentive.  My mother could have a third child but due to the disincentives, she aborted the third one.  Then when the time comes to apply primary school, it reaches the time where those with 3 children got incentives, but these are the people who ignored the government campaign last time and have 3 children instead.

Like maybe 5-6 years down the road when u have 3-4 children, then they found birthrate too high, then say 2 is enough campaign again and then pull the incentives then u are with 4 children who are going to go to primary school, later hard to get the children into the same primary school because of the new government policy changes where maybe only the 2nd child got piority and the rest of the children have no such privilege when it was promised years earlier.<br><br>I remember my mother has to argue with the school to get my younger brother a place in the same primary school as the policy then has changed to favour those with 3 children who are people who ignored government policy earlier.
