            <div class='col-md body'>There are many <strong>Crocodiles</strong> in this industry. Small brain, BIG mouth who haven't know the industry and started opening their mouth and deliver the wrong impression of this industry. Those who can't make it after some times got worst by telling the whole world that it is a scam.<br><br>There are also <strong>SeaGulls</strong> who spread their wings to tell everyone they knows by making lots of noise thinking they are the best and yet have no knowledge on how to really build their organisation. They always act as if they knows everything in this industry and will tell you everything they want to tell you but once you want to share your ideas of the industry, they will say that they have another appointment.<br><br>There are <strong>Eagles</strong> that fly around and looking for <strong>Eaglets</strong> to join them in the industry. They will eyed and qualified their protege to make sure they can be trained to become a good leader that can pass their teaching to all their generations.<br><br>Network Marketing / Multi-Level Marketing works for anyone but not for everyone. The drop of rate is the same as any traditional business for the first 5 years and it's at the range of <strong>95-97%</strong>.<br><br>To be successful in this industry, you will need to open your eyes and mind to know who the <strong>True Eagle </strong>and know where these <strong>Eagles</strong> are. As they usually fly alone or with 2 or 3 proteges, it hard sometimes to spot them. Therefore, if you spot one, it would be good to be open and understand what you are in for before you go into the industry, as your future is in your hands.<br><br>Good luck in your search. If you need help to find one, I may be able you tell you where to find some. Cheers.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Come on, i may have an eagle standing in front of me and others may call him a chicken, and if i have a chicken, others will think him as an eagle. Happening all the time, so its hard to know. By classifying, u are like claiming (no offence) that u are an eagle, "flock to me, flock to me" from what i saw in ur post.<br><br>I prefer people add to the discussion table than people dividing the the whole lot into groups,.<br><br>But you are right to say many myths exist around MLM, network marketing, some people comments sounds logical, but truthfully not happening in the NM world. Whatever i posts here is what i saw happened in the industry, not skimming off from books. Well not to argue books are irrelevant, but experience is sometimes the best teacher.<br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Talk seems easy. And challenge a many. It takes one to know the other. Whether I'm an eagle or not it doesn't matter to you as a person with an attitude problem will one day meet his downfall.

I'm sad for your friends.</div></blockquote>Do show us your research then.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Btw, considering there are thousand of products on the market, with virtually all of them overpriced (eg, a 20 cents Coke selling for $1 at vending machines and diluted Coke at 'high class cafe' selling for $2.50), you cannot just show  'similar products with similar impact at cheaper rate' considering the sciences involved in developing these products.And nobody complain much about Coke overpriced by a factor of 5 or 12.<br><br>An example, two nutrition products selling at different prices. Have you considered its long term safety, effectiveness, no drug used, tested and researched and recommended by physicians, accreditation, no blemish in the company's  record etc etc etc. Somewhere in the similarities lies a differencr which increase its price by a factor. This comes especially on two things, like quality manufacture process and high accreditation.<br><br>Once I met a nutritionist who used products which gone thru tremendous quality checks and accreditation. The products was researched for eight years without selling off yet, and they targets two groups of people to test. Physicians (aka doctors) and sportmen. For sportmen, they have to go thru their nutritionists and lawyers before they were accepted, and the company dont even sponsor the sportsmen. They have to buy it from the company. The results were positive from the sportmen and doctors. It was ranked the top company out of 700 nutrition companies in US, and the White House Gym also did a thorough research before adopting it for their president. Their products were FDA approved 90% absorption rate guaranteed. I have not gone yet into the sciences involved.<br><br>One can see the tremendous accreditation and quality research the company goes thru to put the products in the market, and yup this company is an MLM company. Btw I am not part of this company. The product like the weight loss products are selling at one large and one small canister for $45.<br><br>This is not an only example. Seen this example repeated across many MLM companies. Many quality products are put up at higher price, but definitely not higher than less quality ones selling at GNC. This is the irony.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>What I emphasise here is does one consider the criterias used to gauge quality of the products, and also considering the pricing involved? One small difference between two products may trigger off price difference. There are lots of msiconceptions concerning the chain of pricing in retail and MLM biz, and the quality and safety. Many more experienced MLMers than me would love to challenge people on this.<br><br>And if your target MLM companies are AMH, Amway, urm, doesnt reflect the industry as whole. You are just picking bad hats and using them as example. Heard many people used Amway to gauge the industry, had me laughing on floor. Just telling me you havent meet good companies (which are many) out there that offers quality products.<br></div>
