              Do you all think that Anwar is innocent or guilty?
              
              I personally think that Anwar is innocent. Just when the opposition party is gaining power, they suddenly come up with a charge to arrest Anwar just like how they did it 10 years ago..
              
              So obvious that they come up with a fake case to prevent him from entering politics..

              Yes, he was well known for being gay and that's why the first round of charges much less than half the population thought he was innocent.
              
              I don't think he is guilty this time round but I wouldn't be surprised either if he is guilty.  Whatever he does now, Malaysians reaction is he is being framed.  He is like their hero who can do no wrong. All this round around about missing victim, hospital check-up, false witnesses etc. only reinforces the impression that he is being framed.

              <p>if he was really guilty, there would have been more victims.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>only 1 victim each time? maybe he was a very faithful gay only stick to one faithful partner. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> but if his partner was so faithful, why pao tor him. it's like your faithful bf/gf betraying you. what was anwar victim's disagreement with him that let to the victim's police report. how did anwar get a grown man to the position he wanted?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>more like a political manuever, the victim was said to have visited the Najib or Abdullah before he launched the police report, he was requesting for some form of study loan.</p>

              <p>Corruption most government in Asia have, it's just how well it is concealed.</p>
              <p>If you have your relatives and good friends in all those high positions, it is easily conceal because there are no whistle blowers.</p>
              <p>Take Thaksin for example, when he was in power there was no whisper of corruption, but after he lost power, investigations into his business dealings, it was found that he had used government funds for his own benefit.</p>
              <p>He gave loans to one Asian country, but that Asian country must use the loan to purchase goods and services from his private company.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>In the Myanmar case, an army-appointed graft panel accused Thaksin of ordering a state bank in 2004 to increase the size of a loan to the military-ruled former <span id="lw_1217402073_3" class="yshortcuts">Burma</span> to buy telecoms equipment from a unit of Shin Corp, the telecoms conglomerate Thaksin built.</em></p>
              <p><em>The deal caused the bank to lose 670 million baht ($20 million), the panel alleged. Thaksin has denied any wrongdoing, as he has in several other investigations launched against him. </em></p>
