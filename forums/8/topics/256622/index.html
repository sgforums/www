            <div class='col-md body'>Can drive for certain part of the way.  At least in Germany on the autobahn....where they dont have maximum speed limit.  They have minimum speed limit.<br><br>You might be better off travelling most of the way in the Trains.  Where you reach different parts of europe easily.<br><br>There is one country though, if you are planning to go there. You need a visa.  So plan your routes and get your papers before hand. (can remember was it austria or not...sorry, its a long time since I knew that.)<br><br>Then fly there and get ticks for the trains.  If you are a guy, its easier cos you most likely can tahan a few days w/o shower.</div>

By the time i ORD, then i will have bout 2 years plus of driving experience. Nope i have not driven on overseas roads before, but yes ive been to europe and yes ive dealt with and experienced european culture. My friends and I are lookin for more of an adventure.</div>

Infact, backpacking requires extensive research and preparations (months-to-years in advance) in almost every single aspect of the journey, contrast to otherwise popular believes.<br><br>Give yourself time, start small, gain experience. You have plenty of time to embark on a major back-packing after you have acquired the appropriate knowledge and skills.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Come to UK, i'll be your guide around manchester area. When do you plan to visit europe? My advice is to come during summer time. Its the only time worth spending in europe. THat is from April to early september.<br><br>I dont suggest driving across europe. firstly, its gonna cost quite a bit. Fuel prices here are expensive and rental cars arent cheap either. I'm paying 95pence per liter now, Thats like SGD$2.80 per liter! Rental cars range between 50 to 100pounds a day. If you plan on driving across europe you need special insurance that covers the countries you plan to visit. So overall, not viable.<br><br>Its cheaper to travel by train. You can get a young persons rail card and maybe buy a month pass. You can then hop on and off the trains to most destinations around europe. Best way to travel.<br><br>If you arrive in the UK first, you can also buy cheap no frills air tickets to most parts of europe. If you book early, ryan air does flights from the UK to places like germany for no more than 30pounds inclusive of airport tax.<br><br>Are you a man utd fan? I'm living opposite their football grounds and have brought countless friends on tour around there.<br><br>Driving in the UK is much easier than singapore. The pace of life here is slower and drivers are more willing to give way to you. So i dont think you'll find it difficult to drive over here. You'll be surprised how well mannered the drivers are. London is alittle more hectic, but overall still manageable.<br><br>Your plan is good. Right after army is a good time to go out and explore. ONce you get into the working life, its a different phrase of life altogether. To me, 21 to 24 is the golden years of fun. no commitments, no worries. So, come on over!<br><br>Send me a pm and let me know if you're coming over.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well as above mentioned.  By Train is the best for backpacking across Europe.<br><br>What kinda advanture you and your friends are looking for?<br><br>A working tour advanture?  Picking Berries, fruits?  Have a nice hostel to shower, sleep in once in a while.  Different cusines?<br><br>Even with international driving permit,  because of the language differences, you might not be able to understand the signs or even the signals,  Plus, Singapore drives on the left side on the road, on the ride side of the car.  You need at least 1 week to re-orientate yourself to the driving experience before you should consider driving your friends around.<br><br>so when are you planning to take the trip?<br><br>You already got someone in UK Manchester.  I should be in Germany Munich in August.<br><br>So let us know early your plan.  And make sure you got lots of cash stashed away.  Bring at least one credit card and one debit card, store in different wallets.</div>
