            <div class='col-md body'>Women are infathomable creatures at times. Some just like to say "nothing" when obviously they are not meaning it. They somehow or other believe that guys/b/f have the uncanny psychic power to second guess their thoughts every time correctly. Yet should you guess correctly, there is no guarantee that she will show her appreciation. On the other hand, when you follow/believe exactly what she says, she claims that you are insensitive and uncaring. Why is there such a double standard? Are guys really expected to be so sensitive everytime?<br><br>I agree that when a couple is together, certain things need not be outspoken clearly, but then again could you really fault someone for not being able to catch a hint? i guess on the guy's part, he should try his best to pay more attention to minute details and signials from the girlfriend but it could just be that the guy is not one to catch hints that well especially when it is hidden under layers of "nothing", "really nothing" etc.<br><br>How to resolve that in a relationship? I really have no idea. i guess i face the same situation as stingray as well. Talking it out doesn't seem to work too. Perhaps the more experienced forumites in this forum can shed a light as to the apparant enormous crush on the word "nothing" for certain memebers of the fairer sex?</div>
