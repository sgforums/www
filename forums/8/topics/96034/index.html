            <div class='col-md body'>The Autobahn is the pinnacle of the German driving experience, perhaps the ultimate in driving altogether. Virtually all of the world's serious drivers have heard of it and longed to take their shot at conquering it. German cars are known for their precise engineering and craftsmanship; the Autobahn completes the driving equation.<br><br>Some people are disappointed the first time they drive on the Autobahn. They come with visions of a twenty-lane superhighway where cars are barely a blur as they whiz by. In reality, the Autobahn looks like the average freeway, and despite rumors to the contrary, not everyone is traveling at the speed of sound. And the stories of unlimited speed are only half correct-- many sections of Autobahn do have speed limits.<br><br>Still, the Autobahn offers a transcendental driving experience. The roads are in extremely excellent condition, except in some areas of the east where the government is still trying to undo 40 years of Communist "maintenance". Amenities are numerous, and drivers are well-trained and cooperative. It's life in the fast lane on the Autobahn, and everyone's on the same page.<br><br><img src="http://home.att.net/~texhwyman/g_imgs/autobahn3.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Design</strong></span><br><br><img src="http://home.att.net/~texhwyman/g_imgs/autobahn2b.jpg"><br><br>The general rule for design is to provide for unimpeded, high-speed traffic flow. Unimproved eastern segments aside, most Autobahns feature the following design elements:<br><br>- Two, three, or occasionally four lanes per direction. Lanes on rural sections are generally 3.75 meters wide except the left lane of newer three lane segments- it's 3.5 meters wide. On urban sections, all lanes are 3.5 meters wide.<br><br>- A landscaped "green" median 3.5 or 4 meters wide (3 meters in urban areas). A double-sided guardrail runs down the middle. Blinders are often used on curves. Some newer sections have concrete barriers instead of green medians.<br><br>- Outside emergency shoulders and long acceleration and deceleration lanes.<br>Full grade-separation and access control provided by half cloverleaf interchanges at exits and cloverleafs and directional interchanges at Autobahn crossings. Interchanges are generally well-spaced, sometimes exceeding 30 km between.<br><br>- 4% or lesser grades. Climbing lanes are provided on most steep grades.<br><br>- Gentle and well-banked curves.<br><br>- Freeze-resistant concrete or bituminous surface.<br><br>- Roadbed and surface measuring about 68 cm (27 inches) in thickness.<br><br>In addition, Autobahns also feature the following amenities:<br><br>- Reflector guide posts at 50 meter intervals.<br><br>- Frequent parking areas, often equipped with toilet facilities.<br><br>- Extensive and ample service areas featuring gas stations, restaurants, and hotels.<br><br>- Automated traffic monitoring and electronic signs providing dynamic speed limits and/or advance warning of congestion or fog.<br><br>- Emergency telephones at 2 km intervals.<br><br>- Pre-designated detour routes to facilitate emergency closures.<br><br>- Standardized signage.<br><br>- Wildlife protection fencing and crossover tunnels.<br><br>- Maintenance is superb. Crews inspect every meter of the system periodically, and when a fissure or other defect is found, the entire road section is replaced.<br><br>- Signs, barriers, and other features are also well maintained.<br><br><strong>Urban Autobahns:</strong> Generally speaking, the mainline Autobahn routes avoid the metropolitan cores. Instead, spur routes provide Autobahn access into and within the cities. These spurs are usually built as "Urban Autobahns" (Stadtautobahnen). Design features of Urban Autobahns include six or eight lane elevated or depressed roadways with frequent and more closely-spaced diamond-style interchanges. The standard rural signage standards are suspended in favor of more appropriate closely-spaced overhead signs. There are sometimes no emergency phones or roadside reflector posts. Tunnels and overpasses are more frequent and nighttime illumination is often provided. Medians are usually just double-sided guardrail or concrete barrier.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Traffic Regulations</strong><br><br>To safely facilitate heavy, high-speed traffic, special laws apply when driving on the Autobahn:<br><br>- Vehicles with a maximum speed rating of less than 60 km/h (36 mph) are prohibited as are bicycles, mopeds, and pedestrians.<br><br>- Passing on the right is prohibited! Slower vehicles must move to the right to allow faster traffic to pass, and drivers should stay in the right lane except to pass. When passing, you must do so as quickly as possible.<br><br>- Stopping, parking, U-turns, and reverse travel are prohibited, including on shoulders and ramps (except for emergencies, of course.)<br><br>- Entering and exiting is permitted only at interchanges.<br><br>- During traffic jams, motorists must leave an emergency lane between the left lane and the adjacent center or right lane for emergency vehicles. This is accomplished by traffic in the left lane moving as far to the left as possible and traffic in the adjacent lane moving as far to the right as possible.<br><br>- If you have a breakdown or accident, you must move to the shoulder if possible and place a warning triangle 200 meters behind the scene. You must report the incident to the authorities using the nearest emergency phone (see below.)<br><br>- <strong>It is illegal to run out of gas on the Autobahn.</strong><br><br>- There are no tolls to use the Autobahn. It is one of the few free superhighway systems in Europe. There was some talk a few years ago of charging an annual fee (like Switzerland), but that hasn't materialized.<br><br>Driving customs:<br><br>- Motorists at the rear of a traffic jam will usually switch on their hazard blinkers to warn approaching traffic.<br><br>- Although it's illegal, other drivers may flash their high beams at you or use their left turn signal to request that you move to the right to let them pass.<br><br>- Even though the "drive right, pass left" rule is generally adhered to, you may find some cases where motorists will stay in the left or center lane when passing even though the vehicles they're passing are somewhat widely spaced.<br><br><img src="http://home.att.net/~texhwyman/g_imgs/autobahn2.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Despite the widespread belief of complete freedom from speed limits, and a lobbying effort that has the same power and deep pockets that the American gun lobby has, some speed regulations can be found on the Autobahns. Many sections, particularly those with dangerous curves, in urban areas, or with unusually constant heavy traffic, may feature speed limits ranging from 80 to 120 km/h (50-75 mph). In construction zones, the limit may be as low as 60 km/h (37 mph). Also, some sections now feature nighttime and wet-weather speed restrictions, and trucks are always regulated (see table below). Still, much of the Autobahn is unlimited, but there is a recommended limit of 130 km/h (81 mph). This recommendation is generally seen for what it is-- an attempt by the government to cover itself without having to upset millions of Porsche and BMW owners/voters. However, if you exceed the recommended limit and are involved in an accident, you could be responsible for some of the damage costs even if you are not at fault.<br><br><strong>AUTOBAHN SPEED LIMITS<br>(These are maximum "default" limits. Posted signs override these limits.)<br>Car &amp; Bike - 130km/h<br>Trucks, Pickups, Caravans and Buses - 80km/h*</strong><br><br>(* Some vehicles may be exempted from this. A decal resembling a speed limit sign displayed on the back of a vehicle indicates that it is exempt from the general limit and may travel the speed indicated on the label, generally 100 km/h for vehicles up to 7.5t, and 80 km/h for vehicles over 7.5t.)<br><br>Many sections of Autobahn now feature dynamic speed limits which are adjusted to respond to traffic, weather, and road conditions. These speed limits and conditions are indicated using electronic signs.<br><br>A movement by the environmentalist Green party to enact a national speed limit has not made great strides. The Greens claim that the high speeds contribute to air pollution which has caused widespread Waldsterben, or forest destruction. Some Autobahns in forest areas have seen new limits imposed, but a national limit remains unlikely. During the coalition government negotiations in 1998 between the new Federal Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrat party and the Greens, one of the final points to be resolved was the Greens' desire for a nationwide 100 km/h speed limit on the Autobahns. In the end, however, a compromise was struck whereby energy taxes would be raised and local governments could reduce speed limits on city streets, but no national Autobahn speed limit would be implemented.<br><br>A national speed limit of 100 km/h (60 mph) was enacted in November 1973 during the energy crisis. It was repealed less than four months later.<br><br>Despite the general high speeds, the accident and death rate on the Autobahn is relatively low. Autobahn crashes account for only 10% of national traffic fatalities and, in fact, the fatality rate is lower on the Autobahn than on US Interstates.</div>
