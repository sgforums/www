            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>It was a Sunday night and I shared a cab with a friend (still serving in the army then) from Jurong point. I was going back to NTU, and my friend Sungei Gedong camp. So naturally we told him NTU and after that SG camp.<br><br>For those who don't know the place well, NTU is just a short distance from Jurong Point, cab fare is usually about $4. And NTU is just along the way towards Sungei Gedong camp, it's just a small detour. Also, to reach SG camp, it's just $6+ from Jurong point.<br><br><strong>BUT THE BUGGER HAD THE GALL TO EXIT VIA THE EXPRESSWAY 2 JUNCTIONS BEFORE NTU.</strong><br><br>So in the end he went to all the way inside Sungei Gedong camp where my friend dropped off, then made a big round back to NTU. Basically he more than doubled the fair.<br><br>His flimsy excuse was that we should have told him clearly that SG camp was near . But my instructions were clear, NTU then SG camp. Even if he didn't know where SG camp was, he should still have gone on to NTU first?<br><br>I told him that he took the wrong route and why should I pay for <strong>HIS</strong> mistake but he refused to back down and insisted on the meter fare of $16 (should have been around $7). After quarrelling for some time, I was prepared to pay the ridiculous full fare, then complain the following day to bust his a$$.<br><br>Then the lao kan of a cab driver did something that <span style="font-style: italic;">REALLY</span> pissed me off. He fiddled with the meter and *accidentally* pressed the "new fare" button, effectively erasing the previous fare, then told me he couldn't print the damn receipt. Yeah right what a damn coincidence <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">. A taxi driver can't operate his own meter and screws up a simple thing like printing a receipt.<br><br>His condescending attitude while haggling with me wasn't in the slightest bit apologetic. In fact he even told me I was wasting his time, time in which he could go pick up more passengers so i should just pay up quickly.<br><br>I blew up and told him $8. Take it or leave it.  If not you can drive me to the nearest NPP and we settle it there. The bugger accepted the $8 with a disgruntled face, and sped off only a moment after I unloaded my stuff (I had quite a bit of luggage in the back seat).<br><br>Argh, never got to see his plate number because he sped off. Or else I'll make sure there's 1 less cab driver on the roads today.</div>
