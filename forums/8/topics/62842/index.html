You may say something that you already<br>forgotten, but he will remember every words. He wants to be respected and<br>admired and at the same time he does not like people to have power over him.<br><br>When he falls in love, he really falls deep. A man in this Zodiac once in<br>love, he will be sweeter than sugar. He does not like a plain and simple<br>woman. A complex woman's mind is his venture. Always be interesting and able<br>to talk to him about every things in any subjects. He does not like a woman<br>who sits around waiting for his call.<br><br><strong>SCORPIO WOMAN</strong><br><br>A simple woman who always show what kind of a moods she is in.

She is quite fair<br>in justice, so she can accept your apologies as much as she can pretend to<br>accept things for now and wait for a pay back revenge in the future. If you<br>are nice to hear, she will double that to you as well. A real fair woman.<br><br>She likes to make and spent money. She likes to have fame and reputations,<br>and never let herself broke and have no name at the same time. She is too<br>proud and will not accept status of being "Poor". She loves to have face, so<br>if you are a manager with small salary, she will be proud more than more<br>money being a truck driver. She hates to think and she can not stand a<br>feeling of being a "Nobody".<br><br>If you like her, play a little hard to get. This will excite her a bit. When<br>you go out on a date, set your schedule, but do not let she knows that you<br>have planned this for weeks.
