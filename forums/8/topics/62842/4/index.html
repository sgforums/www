            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by narz:</div><div class="quote_body">Highlighted in <span style="color: blue;">blue</span>: mostly true. Pretty accurate I would say  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>She thinks the world is watching her through the eye glasses of rose petal frame. She thinks people think and talk about her only about good things and often disappoint to know the fact that they are not true and not even real, so she will feel hurt. She think her path has to be a beautiful one. <span style="color: blue;">She think only good things so she prepares and always make arrangement for herself to be in the right path always, quite systematic indeed.</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">If there is no guy in her life, she will be busy with herself. This seemingly ordinary woman will push herself to meet her goal. </span>Her face mostly will be slim and long, high cheek bone, Eye brow slightly curve up, slight tall more than short, thin lips and <span style="color: blue;">she will have quite a confusing or mixture of character.</span><br><br>Sometimes, she will be very careful about guy she will mingle with. <span style="color: blue;">She thinks as if she has a main CPU in her head and she could memorize everything from her childhood. When she faces with problems, she will handle them and solving them very well, and at the same time showing other people that she has that capability. She can put her mind in solving problems in crisis better than many other Zodiac. Once she determine to do thing, nothing will stop her.</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Woman in this Zodiac could be totally different from one woman to another woman. You could see her in the party dancing like flash dance or dirty dancing, as well you could also see her as an old fashion lady or a geek. She could be someone flashy and wanted by many men, or she could be a cold and non-social person. She will have her own way to win you over. Once she choose you, she will need to be proud of you.</span><br><br>"Love" is not as important to her as "Marriage". Her real goal in life is "Safety" and her position in other people sight need to be "Secure". <span style="color: blue;">She plans her life, and socially life easily and very carefully. She is also very artistic and realistic, so if you are a nobody or nothing, no chance because she loves ambition and a good life.</span> She need lots of love,but do not want and do not belief in an occasional or unconventional love.<br><br>She is a proud in nature type, so if you see a woman in this Zodiac come from a poor family, she will act like a woman from a noble family by birth anyway (certainly there are always exception). She always look cool even when she is not. <span style="color: blue;">She like to make people see her as "secure and confident" even she is a mixed emotion and mixed character type. If she is mad, you can tell right away and she can stay moody for quite a long time.</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">You never have all her times, for she likes to work hard and also spent some spare times working for charity. You will see woman in this zodiac a "Volunteer" for camp, and if she is in a high society, she will most likely be a president or a V.P. of a "Club". She is a romantic and artistic, but being poor and unstable is certainly not in her dreams. Her beautiful imaginations need to be realistic, for failure is not in her plan.</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">A Goat always climb high, so either she start from a low point or a high point, she will make sure at the end she will have the best spot. She will not show her ambition, but she will show that she satisfy with herself now. Once you look back she already moved up again , quietly but sure.</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">If she is your love one, be supportive and understand her. She is stubborn, but she will listen. </span>She will act like a gentle fragile person,but in fact she can stick you down like a super glue without you knowing it. </div></blockquote>Totally agree!</div>

His creative mind could create<br>fantastic idea any time. If you do not understand or can not follow him, you<br>won't be with him for long.<br><br>A man in this Zodiac will less likely to have a pale skin, and if he has a<br>scar, it would be on his face or on his head. He moves very fast and very<br>energetic, and he has a very self confident in himself. He is not the type<br>to sit down and feel sorry or regret anything for long, especially with<br>"Love". He loves justice. He dares to show his opinion or even argue about<br>certain subject even he knows it might bring him problems. A straight<br>forward type of guy.<br><br>He hardly lies except if he think it is necessary and he is not a good liar<br>anyway. He will not lie to you about serious matter, but if he lie he will<br>lie only a small little thing. He is gifted with the ability to be a very<br>social person. He could talk even about subject that he has no knowledge of.<br>He interests only at the present time and look at the world positively. Many<br>times he feels hurt because of reality, but he will not run away and he will<br>overcome that difficulty.<br><br>Even he is a high and self confident type and center his own thought as a<br>main focus, but at the same time he is a kind, cute and polite guy. He<br>certainly is not a mean person. He likes to help people who are in troubles<br>even he is not asked to. He is the type who feels sorry if you remember bad<br>things he said to you that he had already forgotten,but you did not.

Strangely he like to<br>overpowered this type of people to assure that he is more superior.<br><br>He like to be the first person to do something. You can see sparkling in his<br>eyes, once he meet a new target or new lover. Once he is in love, he will<br>act as if he never has love like this before. This minute he could be real<br>sugar sweet, and later he could also be an icy cold, but do not blame him<br>for that will only chase him away. He could fall in love again with another<br>girl and act again like he never has this kind of love before.He could<br>really love someone, but not a heart broken type for he thinks love is<br>"excitement" and "Love goes on".<br><br>If you date this kind of guy, do not or avoid showing your face to him with<br>face pack, face mask, always be presentable, nice and cute. If he is quiet<br>not because he is shy, but he is only quietly thinking. If you have a chance<br>to ask his X-girlfriend, she will tell you that he is not a shy or quiet<br>type. If he is really and truly in love with you, he will never lie to you<br>at all. How do you know if he loves you, bet on your faith!
