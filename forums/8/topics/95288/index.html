            <div class='col-md body'>Dear friends,<br><br>The Principal of Clementi Town Sec School is appealing for help for one of her<br>students. Please see message below. For those can help, please make an effort to<br>do so. For those who can't, pass it along.<br>Thanks!<br><br>Subject: CALL FOR HELP<br>I would really appreciate if you are able to help in whatever way and pass the<br>message on to those you know and may want to help. The appeal was written by one<br>of my staff and I am forwarding it to my friends.<br><br>There is a boy in my school (Clementi Town Secondary School) who is diagnosed<br>to be suffering from leukaemia, a blood cancer. As such he will require A+<br>platelets for transfusion from time to time.<br><br>Doctors have diagnosed it to be in the early stages and thus chances of<br>recovery are high, given the right treatment and supply of platelets.<br><br>If you are at least 45 kg with the above-mentioned blood groups, and would<br>like help save this boy's life, please visit the NUH Blood Donation Centre (3rd<br>Level) for a screening compatibility test.<br><br>The centre is opened from 8.00 am to 4.30 pm daily (except weekends). On<br>Wednesdays, it is opened till 7.30pm. Lunch hours are opened. Saturday opening<br>hours are from 8.30 am to 12 noon.<br><br>Please indicate that you'd like to donate your platelets to Ye<br>Siwei(NRIC :8407182Z).<br><br>If your platelets are suitable for use, the hospital will contact you when<br>there is a need. Besides platelets, Siwei also need O+ blood for transfusion.<br>You may also want to help in this way.<br><br>Recently, his father had also met with an accident and is still<br>suffering from the effects of a serious head injury. Your assistance will go a<br>long way in encouraging Siwei and the grief-stricken mother.<br><br>The school will appreciate if you can help spread this message around among<br>friends and relatives you know.<br><br>If you have queries, you may call Mdm Ang at 6777-0448 (CTSS<br>staffroom)or email me at lbw@piaget.moe.edu.sg<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey hey, people, please stop passing this email around. It is very very very long ago. That boy has already passed away. I'm from Clementi Town Secondary School, and one of my teachers sent this email out to help the boy.<br><br>Whoever was the one who resurrected this email was really blur. My teacher was very irritated because of the number of phone calls from people expressing their concerns, but she cannot vent her frustration because those people were calling with good intentions. She told us she became an operator and was interrupted a few times during her lessons.<br><br>So, please, this email is expired. No more. So, thank you to those who are concerned.</div>
