The founder of modern Singapore is none other than a local man named Lee Kuan Yew, not some Sir Stamford Raffles from British East India Company.<br><br>For the British, from their viewpoint of history, of course they will see Sir Raffles as the founder of Singapore. But why is Singapore following this British-centric viewpoint?<br><br>He was the first British to rule there and the first British to establish British East India Company operating there. The British view him as the founder of Singapore, naturally. It is through Raffles that Singapore existed in their map of British Empire.

Then he developed it further, and so, this is where people start to say 'founder of singapore' .<br><br>What a nonsense.<br><br>What he did was only partial in Singapore's overall history.<br><br>Don't forget the Singapore that Raffles ruled through British East India Company was only for a period of time, and only partial in Singapore's overall history.

Standing and folding his arms so smugly?<br><br>And....why is he positioned prominently as if to convey 'yeah...look at this SG...this is my achievement'<br><br>And why is it when u go to Changi Airport and u read a brochure, sometimes u read 'Singapore was founded/ established by Sir Stamford Raffles...'<br><br>I say, remove all this nonsense.<br><br>This is a very bad colonial legacy.<br><br>Remove his statue and remove any mention of him being a founder/ establisher. Especially the wording 'Founder of Modern Singapore' . This is a very bad colonial mindset and very very British-centric. The founder of modern Singapore is none other than a local man named Lee Kuan Yew, not some Sir Stamford Raffles from British East India Company.<br><br>For the British, from their viewpoint of history, of course they will see Sir Raffles as the founder of Singapore. But why is Singapore following this British-centric viewpoint?<br><br>He was the first British to rule there and the first British to establish British East India Company operating there. The British view him as the founder of Singapore, naturally. It is through Raffles that Singapore existed in their map of British Empire. But wait, this is their viewpoint of history, isnt it?????<br><br>Don't forget Singapore already existed and was already populated before he bought the land for British East India Company. Then he developed it further, and so, this is where people start to say 'founder of singapore' .<br><br>What a nonsense.<br><br>What he did was only partial in Singapore's overall history.<br><br>Don't forget the Singapore that Raffles ruled through British East India Company was only for a period of time, and only partial in Singapore's overall history. Don't forget the Singapore that he ruled was one where colonialism exist, where British people are more superior and Chinese, Malays, Indians are all subjects of the British Empire.<br><br>Why is he called 'Founder of Singapore' ? Especially 'Founder of Modern Singapore' ?<br><br>He should be called 'Ruler of Colonial Singapore in 19th century'<br><br>Singapore is not 'found' or 'established' by any one person. And, Modern Singapore is not a colonial Singapore in 19th century where colonialism still exist and Chinese Malays Indians are all still British subjects.<br><br>I say, the true so-called founder of Modern Singapore is a man named Lee Kuan Yew. His statue should have been placed where Raffles is standing so smugly now.<br><br>This is a very bad colonial legacy.<br><br>Look at the photos.<br><br><img src="http://www.fotosearch.com/comp/STK/STK008/DJH05603.jpg"></div></blockquote>we address him as a person who found singapore to have the opportunity to achieve what it had now; not the country or empire and colonial legacy. it's just how u want to interprete it. anyway, dun worry the snr lee will definately get his statue done someday.</div>
