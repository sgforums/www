            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : The National Kidney Foundation's (NKF) defamation suits against the Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) came to abrupt end on Tuesday at the High Court.<br><br>This, after its CEO TT Durai admitted during intense cross examination that some of the fittings in its headquarters, which were highlighted in a Straits Times article, were indeed extravagant for a public charity.<br><br>The article spoke of a glass panelled shower, a pricey German toilet bowl and a gold plated tap.<br><br>Mr Durai finally withdrew both his and the NKF's case against the SPH and its journalist Susan Long.<br><br>NKF's CEO was in the witness box for the second day and he was to be the only one.<br><br>Senior Counsel Davinder Singh's cross examination focused on several areas.<br><br>First, the business relationships Mr Durai had with NKF board member Ms Matilda Chua.<br><br>These were through two companies - Proton Web Solutions, a call centre operations based in India, which NKF had contracted its tele-marketing work to - and Global Net, in which Mr Durai himself had a stake.<br><br>Mr Durai also said he had held several directorships in addition to his work as CEO of the NKF.<br><br>Asked if he had informed the NKF Board of these appointments, he replied that it was not consequential and the Board gave him the liberty to do so.<br><br>The court also heard the NKF had a fleet of eight cars and drivers, which Mr Durai and its visiting guests and VIPs could use.<br><br>NKF also paid for the road tax, repair and maintenance for Mr Durai's personal Mercedes Benz.<br><br>On NKF's reserves, the court was told it stood at $262 million as of July 2005.<br><br>Mr Singh argued that if the NKF stopped all fundraising activities and concentrated on treating kidney patients, it would still have enough money to see through its operations for 30 years, based on its expenses scheduled for 2003.<br><br>For that year, the NKF received $24.4 million for patient fees for dialysis but spent some $31 million for these operations.<br><br>So even if it was out of pocket of $7 million to $8 million per year, NKF's current reserves were sufficient for at least 30 years.<br><br>But Mr Singh says the organisation has been telling Singaporeans its reserves won't last more than three years, according to statements made by its officials.<br><br>Another issue that arose during the cross examination was that of patient numbers.<br><br>Mr Singh argued that NKF had overstated its patient numbers and this would have given the impression to the public that more funds were needed to run its operations.<br><br>The final straw came when Mr Singh began to zoom in on the issues of contention - the expensive fittings which the Straits Times article had highlighted.<br><br>Mr Durai agreed they were expensive and extravagant for a public charity and withdrew his and the NKF's cases.<br><br>The trial which was to have lasted for ten days ended in two days.<br><br>Speaking to the media afterwards, Mr Durai told reporters that litigation is always fought with difficulty.<br><br>On public reaction to the revelations in court, he said the NKF is quite aware of what may happen but its track record spoke for itself.<br><br>He said the NKF has struggled to be perfect and he himself has tried his best for 37 years. He maintained that the NKF did not hide the truth in any way.<br><br>And there's no running away from the fact that NKF has discharged its obligation to the people of Singapore with a world class kidney programme.<br><br>In a separate statement, the NKF Board says it has discontinued its proceedings against Singapore Press Holdings and its senior writer Ms Susan Long.<br><br>And the decision to withdraw was a considered decision made in the best interests of the NKF, its supporters, donors and patients.<br><br>The Board also reiterated its whole-hearted support for Mr Durai as its CEO and looked forward to carrying on all its life-saving activities with full vigour and strength, and to continue to serve the public to the best of its ability.<br><br>- CNA /ls<br><br></div>
