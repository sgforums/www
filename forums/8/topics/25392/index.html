            <div class='col-md body'>I've been wondering about the importance of having 5Cs in Singapore. How many of us actually managed to achieve them anyway in our lifetime?<br><br>Career?<br>Quite easy to achieve, as long as we get a decent job.<br><br>Condo?<br>Seems like over 80%-90% of us are still stuck in pigeon-hole HDB flats, much less condos and bungalows.<br><br>Cert?<br>And university graduates are not that many, if we take into consideration of the many who didn't managed get a shot at university education, poly, ITE, A-Level, and some who drop out at primary or secondary level. My humble estimate would be only around 30% of each cohort would make it into local universities.<br><br>Cash?<br>Pretty open-ended. No fixed figure. So may find a little enough liaoz but others would never be satisfied even if he's as rich as Bill Gates.<br><br>Car?<br>AFAIK, not many people can afford a car, especially in Singapore, and at least not in the majority.<br><br>And for girls, is the 5Cs criteria a major one in choosing a bf and how much would the lack of the 5Cs in your bf affect you? Do you simply reject guys bcos they don't have 5Cs? Or do you look at other things too? Can you tolerate a bf w/o 5Cs</div>

However, a girl who knows how to cook definitely beat another, who has the same qualities except for knowing how to cook. Likewise, girls choose a guy with more Cs over another.....<br><br>Maybe, a better Qn to ask is wat does 5Cs mean to u?<br>Intimidations or Challenges?<br>If u r intimidated, then look for girls with no standard set on guyz to match someone like u who dun have a set of standards for urself.<br>If they r challenges to u, wont u like to be known as some who possess 5Cs? At least, u r the one choosing n not waiting to be chosen <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Anyway, my opinion is tt a guy who achieves 5Cs is more ATTRACTIVE than one who dun have. Im more concerned abt the path taken to achieving 5Cs which shows a man's maturity(realizing the fierce competitions), determination, portraying a confident look with a driven personality to achieving in LIFE.<br><br>Simply put:an ATTITUDE.</div>
