It is just pityful that you've treated it as a flame instead. Perhaps, my tone was a little inappropriate and I apologize for that. However, if you are a devoted Christian and has great faith in your religion, you won't be making a big fuss over an obvious joke which might have been slightly blasphemous to your religion. Let those be damned into hell by their choice instead. There's no need to go around insulting people. Who is being immature here?</div>
