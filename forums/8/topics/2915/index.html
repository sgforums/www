            <div class='col-md body'>wow, desperate times call for desperate measures.  pending enlistment and all.<br><br>first qn: does she know you at all?  if she doesn't, then the difficulty rating is 11 out of 10, ie harder to ask her out.<br><br>if she does, then my personal opinion is that most girls wouldn't turn down a first date if she doesn't dislike you.  then you have to make quite a good impression during the first date.<br><br>if she doesn't know you personally, then I suggest you ask one of your common frens to organise a group date so at least she knows you exist.<br><br>actually any method (over fone, face-to-face ...) of trying to ask her out is alright.  juz make sure you are quite sincere in your invitation.<br><br>have a little courage, you will be rewarded.<br><br>------------------<br>the good life is one inspired by love and guided by knowledge</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How sure are you that you can maintain a relationship with her when you're in the army?<br><br>You won't be able to get out of camp much and when you do, she'll want to spend every moment with you. Many such relationships break down becos (1) the girl feels the guy is never around when she needs him (2) the guy feels stifled and want time with his buddies, family or even just to be by himself (3) the couple has a lot of unresolved arguments becos he has to go back to camp.<br><br>Sorry for being harsh, but I think you should just forget about her for the moment. It'll save you the heartache.</div>
