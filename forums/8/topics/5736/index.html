Apparently they're only gonna annouce it publically in July.<br><br>My bro had his in-camp training and he's in intelligience and his office got some directive from the G1 whatever (prob the big fucks up there). Apparently the idea was mooted by Minister Teo Chee Hean coz from 2002 local uni school year starts in Jan instead of July so he doesn't want NS boys loitering arnd for 4-6 months after they ORD.<br><br>Sucks man.<br>Oh yeah it affects everyone from Dec '99 intake onwards.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting....not that it affects me of course...I'm in and out of the Service.<br><br>However, I wonder how accurate is the rumour that U sem will start in Jan 2002. Why?<br><br>For a start, it has been announced that from July 2001, Bizad, Science, Arts and Com Science of NUS will have a common first year and therefore, grads from these facs will take 4 years to get a basic degree.<br><br>Thus it would appear improbable that they would change the intake date at such a short notice. Moreover, by delaying U sem to January has a lot of implications.<br><br>'A's results cannot possibly be earlier than early March. In addition to the administration of U admission, we must also remember the scholarship selection process. All these means that if U sem is pushed back to Jan, the girls will be doing nothing for one whole year. Unlikely I feel.....<br><br>If NS is really doing to be extended to three years, then I'm believe that it's for some other reason besides to coincide with an apparant Jan U admission.<br><br></div>

I think its pretty cool... first time in ur life u hold a gun, crawl in mud, wear uniforms, if lucky can get medals... juz like da movies... but for me rite now, it is totally irrelevant to my goals and ambitions man... i dun really think its fair for them to prolong it... my south korean frens only have to serve 2 1/4 yrs in the army and they are technically at WAR with north korea. spore dun even have any immediate threat rite now... (who da frick is gonna launch a nuke at spore when conventional bombs can do da trick?) so i dun think national defense is a good reason to extend NS...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Cluon, if national defense is not a gd reason to extent then what is? We may be in a peace situation now but who knows what may happen? NS is to prepare for and deter any agressive notions by any country. If S'pore waits till something happens then start their preparations won't it be too late? The damage may already be irrepairable.<br>I'm not a supporter of NS extension but should it be true, think the govt. is going to come up with some "righteous, moral" reasons rather than a lame one like coinciding with Uni application. Anyway it does not affect me cos ORD liao unless they extent the reservist period  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmmm although i dun really like the idea of having a 3 yr ns but i do feel that ns is absolutely necessary. As a deterrent force and a protective force. Hmmm shaolinboy, if some country were to invade us, are u going to give in without a fight? Definitly not me. If i were to go down, i bring them with me :p<br><br>Being small, doesn't mean we should give in without a fight. We can be small but we can be tough. And some more modern warfare dun completely rely on numbers. True numbers is very impt but so it quality. We dun have enough soldiers, we make it up in terms of quality.<br><br>If u go analyse the military and geographical and politically scenario here, i think its possible to defend Singapore. To be frank, if Singapore is to go to war, who will we be fighting against? Definitly not China or Japan cos they are too far away.<br><br>With no offense to anyone of any nationality, as far as i know our northern neighours do not really have a large standing army and thier populations isn't that very big either. So we can make up for the lack of numbers in terms of quality and btw they dun have national service so they can't call up a large no. of soldiers in a short time. And time is a crucial factor in modern warfare. And yah dropping a hydrogen bomb on Singapore juz isn't practical. They kill themseleves too.<br><br>NS should still be continued but i think we should get some recognition for the efforts we put in. I'm not very sure abt the situation now but i dun think we are getting any rewards or compensation for the 3 yrs. Quite unfair is it?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Quit complaining abt NS and quit asking for more rewards.<br><br>The rewards are plenty in NS. U become a man...u learn the meaning of life during hardship...and u carry a gun. Think abt it...aren't these rewards compared to those chao keng sissys who carry pens and stare at computers in NS?<br><br>Many years down the road, i prefer to tell my children and grandchildren abt my adventures abt my army days. I won't want them to laugh at me and ask stupid questions abt why i have never touch a gun or play soldier (like in the movies) for my 2.5 yrs in the army.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I fully agree with Jack.<br>Stop thinking about Chao Keng-ing and face it like a man. Anyway I think that NS is getting easier and easier.<br>What with Catered Food (5 different kinds to choose from!!), 3 Tonners to drive you into Tekong, SAR21, employing cleaners for the camp....the next thing you know, they'll have Blangadeshis cleaning your rifle for you.<br><br>I had the normal type of life as a combat personelle in the Army and my WO was a SOB/CB.<br>Rumour has it the Mofo has been charged for giving blowjobs to underaged boys in a public Swimming pool. *hiak* That story changed so many times I dunno anymore.<br><br>But at the end of the day, its the Happy times that you remember.<br>You'll learn to look back and laugh at all the shit they put you through and wonder in the quiet of the night how the hell you put up with all of it.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Fey (edited 20 January 2000).]</div>
