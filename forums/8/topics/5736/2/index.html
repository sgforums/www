            <div class='col-md body'>while i totally agree with about the reasons why NS is implemented... i dun think we should be forced into it. Let those who are "on" go ahead and do 3 yrs. I'm sure there are many of those people. As for others who feel that "chionging" mts are not their cup of tea, let them serve at most 2 yrs or something. Dat way, they can still contribute to society by having enuff time to become businessmen or engineers or politicians or watever they do best in. Not everybody is made to carry guns and go into combat... look at how many "incidents" that happen during NS.. u got people who either get their body parts blown off or chopped off or gunned down coz they simply weren't made for the army... I'm talking abt giving guys a choice here... just like spore women have choice of whether to join army or not... we should too... as a "democratic" country and all...<br></div>

Guys are effectively put out for 2.5 years and they could not get salary for that. They have to start afresh right after.<br><br>I do agree we should have NS, but extending it to 3 years???<br><br>A typical guy goes in NS 18/19 (say after poly or As). He comes out at 22/23. Say he wants to advance himself, goes into uni for 3/4 years. he comes out 24-27 yrs old. THEN he could finally get a job, settle down and probably start a family 31-33. SIngapore's gonna have old father's young kids in future.<br><br>And I have nto put in the fact that this guy's wants is a good life, car, apts, house, or good HDB. And I am assuming he is getting all this Singlehandedly without parents $$$.<br><br>And also the fact that many local companies are hiring qualified foreigners than locals now as they dun have "reservist".

            <div class='col-md body'>interesting replies since my last post in here....<br><br>anyway, i fully agree with Mind. The fact that i'm a regular has nothing to do with it, but even if i'm a NSF, or NSmen, if anyone tries to touch my stuff, i would whack the hell out of him, let alone my country.<br><br>shaolin boy.....1 year learn what???<br>Please......do u even know that by the time u come out of training school, it's almost one year already? assuming u dun go OCS of course....if u do, u get commissioned exactly one year after u get enlisted.<br><br>and after training sch, u still need time to gel as a unit??? unless u're gonna piss in yr pants and try to swim somewhere, if trouble comes, u're gonna need to fight yr way out of it.<br><br>Straits Times had this article sometime this week commenting on war in the 20th century. the percentage of civilian casualties has rose significantly since the Middle Ages and is now abt 50%. Thus civilian or not, if it comes, u may not make it. If i'm going to go down, as Mind said, they're going down with me....definitely<br>some of u might not share my optimism, but i can confidently tell u that if trouble comes around, i'll put my bet on the SAF. simply because we're good enuff. yah.....the army pple will know that there're lots of problems with the army, but let's look at it in context. standards worldwide are dropping...look at the once mighty Israeli army....<br><br>and shaolin boy...pls think think a bit and tell me why the heck a big country like China would whack us? What's in it for them?<br><br>and pls....to get here, u must reach here in the first place....China can't even be sure that they can bring troops across the Taiwan Straits safely let alone bring them across the South China Sea.<br><br>war is not such a simple thing as taking yr M16 or SAR 21 and charging. and S'pore is harder to attack than u think. and no nukes pls....other posts have already explored this option and why it's silly.<br><br>and i dare say that for all of us who has walked the path, we're learnt something from the experience besides just how to fight. after all, life's all about experiences....<br><br>the trick to making it through NS is actually ATTITUDE. have the proper attitude and u'll make it. if not, even if u're a clerk, there're things to make u unhappy.<br><br>btw, Cluon, since u're not in the Service, yet, i can tell u this. Pple dun get their hand and legs blown off cos they are not suitable for the job. it's mostly because they damn bloody hell dun know how to follow regulations, act smart, and dun listen to orders. Of course, there's the famous "Stupidity Factor". u might get to see that video next time....<br><br>once u're out of the service and organising outside activities, u'll realise that the SAF is actually quite a safe place thanks to the million and one safety regulations.<br><br>finally, i feel that 2.5 years is just about the right length of time. just enuff to get sufficient training and application in. 3 years is a bit long.....that much i concede.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Altrex (edited 21 January 2000).]</div>

I would agree that with SAF's capability, they'd probably inflict heavy casualties on the enemy if they dare attempt a 'first-strike'. However, if they were to fight an extended battle or one involving air power superiority. Chances of winning would be slim, unless UN come to the rescue at the same time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Singapore's so small that enemy flying Stealth Bombers can zip across, unload their shit and bomb the entire Mainland Singapore in less than 20 minutes!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>However, if they were to use a H-bomb or a WWII A-bomb.

            <div class='col-md body'>It depends on our war doctrine: whether our forces are trained for a short war or an extended campaign. i hope the SAF got plans for both, if not when we are forced to fight a long campiagn when our doctrine is suited for the short ones we certainly die man.<br><br>another thing, is it me or is the SAF tends to be on the offensive side (meaning we tend to be most effective if we are on the offensive all the time and whether we can be similarly effective if we are on the defensive?) any ppl who had NS could answer this?<br><br>What about if our guys are trained for urban warfare? i certainly think that urban warfare should be taken seriously.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, although the SAF trains their soldiers for both offensive and defensive attacks. I wouldn't be too optimistic about the situation if there was a sudden and stealthly attack on us.<br><br>It is true that they can mobilize and recall every single soldier in about an hour's time (i think), but REMEMBER with wars being fought in the air most of the time, bombers penetrating our air defenses and AWACS aircraft would be able to bomb the whole island in less than 20 minutes!<br><br>I'd doubt we're able to go on offensive as the attacking force would have considered size as a decisive factor to overrun us.

            <div class='col-md body'>I completely agree with jeff's tactics. It doesn't matter who declare war first, but the second war is declared, we got to hit them hard and fast, so that a crippling blow is inflicted on them. Make it such that its impossible for them to regroup or call up more soldiers. Air superiority is vital, if we have control over the air, i think the damage they can do to us will be severly limited eg they can't bomb us, so our city will be more intact and air support can definitly boost the ground troops. But then that doesn't mean we can rely on air force alone, cos even if we have a gd air force but a lousy army, i think our enemy still can overrun us. So army is the basic element and should be strengthed first before any other elements. Realistically speaking, only soldiers (not ships or planes) can stop enemy soldiers from entering our territory.<br><br>I dun believe in all out defend or offensive. We can't be on the defense all the time. We got to take the offensive and take over some of their territory and make that a buffer zone. Given our lack of resources, it is a disadavantage for us to fight long term warfare. So we got to have our own water supply ( build more water purification plants) and other essential stuff. If we cripple them and have a rock solid defence, counter attacks shouldn't be a problem to us.<br><br>Using of hydrogen or atomic bombs on us, sigh, even if they destroy us, they will be in deep shit too. Not only singapore will be hit. The other neighbouring country will be hit too and this isn't wise at all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sighz....I've been following this topic since it first started and watched it drift from NS - 3 years to a discussion on S'pore's national security.<br><br>Anyway, anyone out there realised that most (not all...but most) of u out there are talking as if the potential enemy has military capabilities on par with the US or something like that.<br><br>PLEASE....get real. The SAF is NOT meant to fight a regional war or something like that. Stealth bombers...HA!!!!! A big HA to that. Wake up...u find the Stealth bomber for me. Cruise missiles?<br><br>Many of u have been reading too much of those top military capability stuff and dun realise a simple fact. If anyone really attacks S'pore, it's our neighbours. DEFINITELY. Let's not go into geo-politics and a lot of strategic issues here, but let's be realistic.<br><br>True...S'pore can be carpet-bombed in a few minutes. I concede that pt. But who the heck has the capability to carpet bomb us? No one near enough to surprise us has the capability to. The ownership of military hardware in the region is a very touchy issue. Look at our neighbours. The Mats can't even get the MIG-29 squadron up and running. The much-vaunted Thai carrier? How many times has it sailed? Once...when they displayed it. No one in the region has the capabilities a lot of u are describing out there.<br><br>True...there are lots of flaws with the army and in particular, some of the key formations like Armour. There are limitations of the much-vaunted Bionix that seem really laughable. I won't go into them now as I would consider these sensitive information a security breach.<br><br>Infantrymen die like flies. An undeniable fact. Since the rifle and the machine gun was first used in WW1, it's been the case. Look at Vietnam. The US killed more Viet Congs through carpet-bombing etc...but do u know how many they lost?<br><br>You're talking about closed terrain. Up slopes. I remember one distinctive exercise on Rambutan Hill in my training days when I lost most of my men without even reaching the objective.<br><br>FIBUA is the same. One of the reasons why the US dropped the bomb on Japan is to avoid bloody FIBUA fighting.<br><br>Manpower. While I can't be really sure, what I remembered from one of my old security lectures is that our northern neighbour's standing army strength is something like 150 000. Can't be bothered to check Jane's for the exact figure. S'pore, unless I'm wrong, can put more than 250 000 in the field inclusive of NSmen, NSFs and regulars.<br><br>Of course, our BIG southern neighbour can really beat us up in terms of manpower. After all, we are "a mere red dot". Though I would really like to see them try to put troops on S'pore. Their capability is a fraction of China's and China likewise, don't dare to risk sending troops over to Taiwan by sea without unacceptable losses.<br><br>Air-drop? Air assault? Hmm...so I suppose the air force, acknowledged by Jane's and the US as the best in the region is useless. And our pilots, who can beat US pilots in dogfights can't shoot down a transport plane.<br><br>I agree fully with Mind that while air power is VERY impt, the Army is still a key factor. And can we not talk abt sensitive things like buffer zones here? This is a PUBLIC forum. Pple overseas read this too.<br><br>Armour has a LOT of problems and limitations. We're not alone. The M1A1 and Bradley of the US has some problems which are amazing too. Our neighbours have some problems even more laughable. Like the firing angle of their MBT. Big gun on a tank doesn't mean nuts....can the tank take it in the first place?<br><br>Will we lose half the men in the first 8 hrs? We might....but the enemy would probably lose almost as much. The problem with S'pore's defence is that S'pore is too small to be untouched.<br><br>You can NEVER stop every single bomb or even arty shell from falling on S'pore. Will the average "nuah" S'porean accept it? His/her home destroyed? I wonder, I really do.....<br><br>Sometimes, the Armed Forces don't lose the war. The people do. Militarily, the US never lost the Vietnam War. They gained more ground and killed more people. But they lost too many men as well. The US people couldn't accept the losses.<br><br>Or sometimes, politics lose a war. While I really dun think that we would ever fight due to ideological conflicts, I really wonder if the average S'pore can accept the harsh realities of war.<br><br>A lot of pple out there have a defeatist attitude. More pple can't think of why they should defend S'pore when they can leave. As with anything in life, if u dun think u can do it, u never will.<br><br>And Oakenfold is right in one thing. If you are a lousy soldier at the end of 2.5 years, the 0.5 year more is not gonna make a big diff....<br><br>My condolences to Dakar if the 3 year thingie is true. Have a positive attitude and u'll make it through.<br><br></div>

But they lost too many men as well. The US people couldn't accept the losses."<br><br>Such a comparison is faulty as Singaporeans will be fighting for their homeland while Americans were waging an extraordinary war for all the wrong reasons in the wrong place. I doubt many Singaporeans would contemplate capitulation purely due to a high casualty count.<br><br>Military victories and territorial possession hardly mattered in Vietnam, for the NVA was fully prepared to accept unlimited losses indefinitely. It was the kind of war the US military establishment failed to comprehend. Even with full public backing, the US could only have achieved a stalemate. To actually stand a chance of winning, the US would have had to begin with a complete overhaul of the military effort and the mindset of the top brass on down.<br><br>"Or sometimes, politics lose a war. While I really dun think that we would ever fight due to ideological conflicts, I really wonder if the average S'pore can accept the harsh realities of war.

As with anything in life, if u dun think u can do it, u never will."<br><br>When it comes down to the crunch, people generally rise to the occasion. Comfortable Americans certainly did in WW2. Mistakes and casualties will undoubtedly be high in the early stages, but the phase will pass. It's a no-brainer to say we'll tuck tail and run when invaded, but in practicality it is almost impossible. Where will you run to? Will you leave your entire extended family behind to face the music? Can you beat everyone and his mother to the airport before it gets shut down? Will the SAF permit you to leave in the first place? Resolve will inevitably stiffen when the easy options vanish.<br><br>That said, I remain thoroughly skeptical of the latest 3 year NS rumour. Every few months for the past 5 years the grim spectre looms, purportedly from "reliable sources". I'll believe it when I see it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We will be fighting to defend Singapore as if we surrender and run,where can we run to???So i think that we will not capitulate so easily as we are fighting our homeland,i have no doubts that the average 'nuah' singaporean will not rise to the ocasion,but it will take some time for us to get used to it as evident in WW2 when initially the americans took heavy losses from the germans,but eventually turned the tide,thus proving that a citizen's army can beat a regular,well trained force if the time and situation and the circumstances call for it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">))</div>
