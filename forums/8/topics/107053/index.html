            <div class='col-md body'>ok... this is not to scare you... but i've had urticaria and dermographism for 15 years... and have yet to recover...<br><br>went to national skin centre twice, as in 2 courses of treatment, not 2 times. first when i was still in sec school - referred there by polyclinic, saw doc, did tests, experimented w different types of medication (i took hydroxyzine/atarax for nearly 10 yrs), no cure. "treatment" lasted for 2 yrs. finally, they said i just have to endure and wait for it to go away by itself. second time i went was referred by co doc. this time, i'm older and told more i.e. what i'm suffering from and why it happens. went 4 times over 4 months - same conclusion. only change in medication - i'm currently taking zyrtec, an otc drug (quite ex - one tab's $1~2, luckily my co's paying for it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">).<br><br>basically, it's due to overactive mast cells on our skin. they're like the soldiers in our body. when our skin's being "invaded", these cells raise the alarm and send for reinforcements to protect the skin, hence the redness when one's bitten by insects or scratched. however, in our bodies (for those who suffer from urticaria), these mast cells are over-enthusiastic. minor irritations set them off, hence easy redness and itching. this, of cos, is but a very simplified explanation - for laymen like us to understand why this is happening to us. but of course, this doesn't cure me. i'm still told to just take medication and wait for it to go away.<br><br>i'm still waiting...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>however, with my years of "experience", there're things i'd advise you to avoid (these may differ from person to person, but what i can tell you is what i experience myself):-<br>* dust - i can't deal with dusty, dirty stuff. my hands itch and swell. not all bad, spares me from doing dirty work like packing and warehousing. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>* stay away from paint - during cny period, when my family were painting the house, i started breaking out in vicious rashes due to the toxins. i had to stay away from my own home till the paint dries. no need to help.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>* don't wear furry stuff / prickly fabrics, esp in hot weather<br><br>* bring your antihistamines whereever you go! i've been taking it for 15 years, almost daily... i try not to (i know it's not good), but i can't live without it for more than 3 days. so i keep some everywhere i can - home, office, my frequently-used bags etc... and of course, when you travel. i forgot to bring my med when i was in shanghai in apr this year. it was pure torture, i had to go everywhere to look for pharmacies and even then, it was all in chinese! nobody understood what i wanted, nobody even heard of zyrtec! i experimented with various types of flu med (these are usually antihistamines) until i found one that works. i had a few torturous, sleepless nights before that...<br><br>* avoid eating too much seafood and preserved food, esp instant noodles.<br><br>* try not to scratch as that only worsens it, although i can understand how diff that can be *grimace*<br><br>that's about all i can think of now. everyone who knows me knows i get rashes very easily and sometimes my friends/colleagues will point it out to me and ask me what happened. but after so many  years, i've grown immune to it and just wave it off as i know it'll subside after a while. although i do hate it when it's on my face/neck 'cos it's so ugly, but no choice. stay cool - it helps.<br><br>my mom's more distressed than me and goes around searching for doctors and special "recipes" to cure me. i've seen so many doctors, taken so much bitter chinese med, eaten so many weird types of stuff (sea horse soup, greenish duck eggs, to name a few) i've lost count. i've lost hope but she hasn't. hahahaa....<br><br>sorry for the extremely long post (think it's my longest ever! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ) but it's something very close to my heart.<br><br>but not to worry, i have known friends who suffer from it and recover in 3 months. so far, i'm the only one i've known to suffer from it for so long... the doctors all say i'll recover when i'm older. guess i'm still not old enough... hahahahaaa...<br><br>all the best...</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>another thing - i don't apply lotions at all. in fact, i hate it. the docs used to give me steroid creams but i never use them.<br><br>my rationale: the rashes go away in 5~20 mins. i don't think the creams help and i don't like the sticky feel. besides, sometimes, i itch in so many areas i'd feel really uncomfy to cover myself in cream all over.<br><br>i still find oral medication most useful...<br><br>i've heard homeopathy works for some. i never tried though - not a huge believer. you can try though if you want... lemme know if it works! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
