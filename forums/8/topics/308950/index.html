              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I've been working in a private company for almost 3 years, when i first started, my salary is $1000 and subsquently increased to $1100 when i was being confirmed after 3 months. Now i just find out all my collegues (we come together and do similar job) had get an increment last year, from $1100 to $1300, and guess what? my company started looking for a lady last year and you know what they offer to her for a starting salary? $1100! and after confirmation, her salary is now $1200.</p>
              <p>Keep in mind that all our education lv, experience etc are very similar, hence there's no reason for this unfairness to happen.</p>
              <p>So i confront my boss and guess what? At first he keep assuring me that there's no such thing as new staff getting paid more than old staff things like that, until I very dulan and tell him what i actually know, then he suddenly say" wa, you know a lot hor!" then in the end decided to give me an increment to $1200 and explained to me that the salary was not being adjusted because i never request for it.</p>
              <p>Now what i get now? a mere $100 increment after working for almost 3 yr while my collegues all get $200 increment since last yr?</p>
              <p>I've never taken a mc before and have only taken 1 single day of leave after all this while, I often come as early as 1 hr before working hrs, (start at 8am but i come at 7am), and i never claim OT before and what i get now? I admit i don't like to suck up to upper management and only know how to do my job quietly but i always expect the so call management to be fair.</p>
              <p>I've since tendered my resignation since i already sick of this company. So am i making the right decision? will you do the same thing if you're me?</p>

              <p>I don't think you understand the art of showmanship. Hardworking, yes. Street-smart, no. That could be one possible reason why you are under-appreciated.</p>

              <p>Of course, another reason could be your colleagues are all super-achievers.</p>
