            <div class='col-md body'>Hi people,<br>just read some interesting posts by Rinoa about her romance problem and thought of sharing mine to everyone here too :<br>I'm now experiencing a farnie feeling which, i believe is an extension of a crush. I got to know of girl, through my friend, (both of them coincedentally are from the same country as Rinoa's friend). I didn't get a chance to speak to her much, no chance because of different faculties but i've been unable to get over her, probably due to her looks - so that means it's a crush, yes?<br>So, i tried to get to know her better, and they say the way to make a girl happy, is to, what else, send her a gift. And i did, her favourite one too, chocolates.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>But however, she must have misunderstood my intentions and till now has been silent towards my emails n icq messages (yes, we used to be quite chatty over ICQ). It's quite serious as i still can't get over her during my exam preparation, n it's just a crush !! I gathered from friends that she's close to everyone but once she suspected your intentions, she will give u the cold shoulders...so does that make her hypocrite?<br>I wonder if in the near future, when i get to know another girl, and after we can clique, will that same feeling be manifested on her due to my previous failure? Love is such a complicated issue. I fear of losing another friend because i'm too quick to express my feelings towards her (not to my current crush, but to the next one who can clique with me.) But, isn't it much better to say it out than let the opportunity slip by? I'm pretty confused man...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Juz..<br>She is not bring a hypocrite, she is trying to avoid you cos she dun want u to plunge in deeper...she is actually helping u...trying not to lead u on...I think it is quite clear that she only want to remain as friends with.You must learn ti take cues from girls sensitively or else you will get badly hurt for sure. Just try to tell her that u cherish as a friend and have no ill-intention.I think it will be fine.<br><br>You are still young and have lots of chances to meet a girl that appreciate u..so dun fret.<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah! I agree with Rinoa, she's juz trying not to lead u on, so she's avoiding u to prevent accusations of that sort.<br><br>Its best to tok it out with her, juz be frank abt it. That's the only way if u still wanna remain frens with her.<br><br>Good luck!</div>
