They go the same route rock style with fast and slow numbers. One thing Mayday is over Beyond are their Hokkien rock songs solid!!!!! It is like Mayday hokkien vs Beyond cantonese cool!<br><br>To me, Mayday represent the next stage and carry on the rock music torch after Beyond has retreated. Who knows I predict their lead singer should die pretty soon. You know rumors always say G*d above is jealous of prodigious talents.

            <div class='col-md body'>i love beyond~! after so many yrs i am still listening to thier old songs.<br><br>actually many of thier songs has its meaning/story behind. i didnt know much about it when i was young. Those who can understand the lyrics well may know it.<br><br>Like in "GuangHuiShuiYue", it's a song about Mandela, the South Africa president who is black, who fight for the rights of black ppl, who seeks peace, anti racism.<br><br>In "QingRen", it's actually a goodbye song for all thier fans. cos they became famous in HK, got thier chance to go japan to become internatinal stars. before they leave, they wrote this song, for thier fans who had beed supporting them for 10yrs.<br><br>"Amani", one word "Peace", everyone knows this.<br><br>"Paradise" and "zhu ni yu kuai" is for the memory of JiaQu, obvious enuff.<br><br>Others songs like "Zhen de ai ni", "Da di","Nong Min" etc are very meaning too.</div>

It is like Mayday hokkien vs Beyond cantonese cool!<br><br>To me, Mayday represent the next stage and carry on the rock music torch after Beyond has retreated. Who knows I predict their lead singer should die pretty soon. You know rumors always say G*d above is jealous of prodigious talents.
