            <div class='col-md body'>1) Lak pati is indeed a despot... He probably still thinks that he si still in the army... Kept on going on how he was in SAFTI as RSM, i think...<br><br>2) No comments on the ghostly appriation... Maybe the kid was still high after smoking, a favourite school pastime... Albeit a stupid thing to do in a SCHOOL toilet, with 'hidden' cameras everywhere... For what i don't know... Lak's pleasure?</div>
