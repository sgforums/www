Girl turns bitchy and slutty....<br>4. but beside that, some remnants of her original kindness still remains...<br>5. Girl avoids good boys so that they wouldn't turn into jerks<br>6. Girl looks for jerks and spends the rest of her life trying to cut his balls off while at the same time avoiding his nasty hands from scratching her eyes out<br>7. Preferably girl and jerk lives unhappily forever while good boys and good girls finally see how silly it is to turn into jerks/sluts/bitches and forget about BGR altogether.<br><br>Whatever and ever, Amen.<br><br>------------------<br>My notion of a husband at forty is that a woman should be able to change him, like a bank note, for two twenties.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Callan,<br><br>Your simple scenario should be the way to how r/s is about. However, our society don't work this way. There are people who just don't want to see that a perfect relationship is in front of them, and choose to go around in circles. What is the point of trying to change a person? I find it amusing now that nice guys turn to jerks because they were rejected or hurted by gals who treated them badly. Why should a guy lose his principles in order to get a gf? This is so pathetic.<br><br>Guys should learn to respect themselves when going on a r/s. We should love or accomodate the feelings of a gal, but we should never go to extremes while trying to please them as much until they can manipulate us. It is so sad to see that.<br><br>I do think that there are cases of your kind of storyline happened. Well, as a spoiler to those who are watching "Tian Di Hao Qing" or Secret of the Heart in TCS 8, the nice thing which gives me hope in the world, is that nice guys like Jiaxiong (played by Sunny Chan) still win in the end.<br><br>yours,<br>Prodigal<br></div>

As for nice guys...hey I think I still qualify for one, guess thats why I am single now huh? I am thinking of reverting to my Ah Beng days, for a fling and stuff you know? Back then, girls are a lot more easier to understand, somehow if you are bad, they come to you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, I think these are what happen instead:<br><br>Version A<br>1) Gal mets jerk<br>2) Gal falls for jerk<br>3) Jerk cheats on gal and/or treats her badly<br>4) They break up<br>5) Gal develops low self esteem and thinks she is undeserving of love.<br>6) As a result, she subconsciously sabotages herself. She thinks it was her fault, not the other party's, so she goes on dating the same type of guys (read: jerk).<br>7) The cycle repeats itself. The only difference is that the gal develops even lower self esteem this time round and falls more deeply into the vicious cycle.<br><br>I'm told that this happens to women with poor relationships with their fathers too.<br><br>Version B:<br>1) Gal mets Jerk<br>2) Gal falls for Jerk<br>3) Jerk cheats on gal and/or treats her badly<br>4) They break up<br>5) Gal becomes an "Ice Queen" after the experience becos she's scared of getting hurt again.<br>6) Guys are intimidated by Gal's coldness and haughtiness. Only those who are confident of their success with women dare to approach her. Unfortunately, a mix of "good with women" + "single" often equals to "serial dumpers/dumpees" (read: jerks)<br>7) Cycle repeats itself<br><br>I dun think it's a matter of classifying people into good/bad or trying to change them. It's a matter of understanding your attitudes towards realtionship and where you've gone wrong so you won't repeat the same cycle.<br><br>[This message has been edited by purr (edited 11 August 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Purr and Callan,<br><br>After going through the two ends of the spectrum in morality, I learned that the world is just not black or white, but shades of grey. I know that a few years back, after a fallen from grace. Good and Bad are merely labels, since on a superficial level, morality is a code which is conditioned by the society at that particular point of era.<br><br>nowadays, there exist so many conceited people who go about in society, pretending to be good, who are in fact naive and tedious. I begin to think it shows rather a sweet and modest disposition to pretend to be bad. I would not say that I am a decent guy, since I have been bad before. I would just say that I am a simple person with so and so values, and not morals. If you pretend to be good, the world takes you very seriously, and once you fall, you are condemned forever. If you pretend to be bad, it doesn't. Such is the astounding stupidity of optimism. I am afraid that good people do a lot of harm in this world by labeling evil to such extraordinary importance. It is nonsensical to split people between good and bad. People are either charming or tedious.<br><br>I think I have not made clear what I meant by "nice" and "jerk" so far. Well, I mean a guy who is "nice", is an altruistic person who cares for the other people, and do things that helps other people without expectation and a jerk is a selfish guy who cares for himself and not for the people around him. It is a relative concept.<br><br>Have a good day. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>yours sincerely,<br>Prodigal<br></div>

Perhaps, like me, after behaving badly for a while one grows accostumed to the bad way of thinking and when one tries to look back to the "good" self one used to be, the memory is already lost.    I think sweet guys behaving badly and managing it very nicely thank you only appear in romance novels...and some romance novels even know better.<br><br>------------------<br>It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle if it's been through a blender first.<br><br>Les Barker:</div>
