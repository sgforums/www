Employers hire poly students not because they have more experience, it is because of the diploma! And your comparison is flawed also because the average JC student will not enter the workplace until they graduate from the university.<br><br>If you think a degree does not mean a good stable job, then pls enlighten me why so many poly grads are trying to enter uni now?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><blockquote>I do have alot of jc friends studying with me in Uni now,the truth is they tend to have harder time to adapt in studies than us poly grads as the subjects we study in Uni have being taught before in poly mostly and the attachment to companies made us gain some working experience.</blockquote>Depends on what you're studying. I think poly students will have difficulty in Maths, for example, compared with jc students. And with so many cross faculty modules to take, the advantage they hold is reduced.<br><br>And don't talk about working experience in school. If what you study in school are not used in the working world, what makes you think the opposite is true?</div>
