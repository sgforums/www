            <div class='col-md body'>Shucks man.... this discussion is still ongoing?<br><br>Let me help you guys summarise everything: that bugger who puts down poly students is a jerk and a loser. To call him an idiot would be an insult to idiots, and he rivals only Salman with his extreme bigotry, arrogance, and tunnel vision. He makes us all JC students look bad. JC students should never follow in his path, and poly students should never assume that all JC students are like that.<br><br>In the end, we are all students with a common goal: the pursuit of knowledge. We just walk different paths to reach it, be it via JC or poly.<br><br>There. So can we please end this discussion now?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess the distinguishing point of JC and Poly is only that theres a uniform for JC while there isnt any for poly...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>To me its just 2 different mode of study..Im from a poly and i've never had the thought that JC students are smarter or for this case..Poly students inferior...<br><br>Its bewildering why some people give such mindless comment such as poly students are stupid...inferior etc etc...I would feel real offended by these comments and so poly students...We should stop this bickering and fall into this degenerating cycle...<br><br>I would be offended too if im from a JC and others call JC students a nerd...<br>Because that would be stereotyping and unfair to them..<br><br>To those that think L1R5 is everything...Let me sincerely tell you that it is not and for this matter, a lousy L1R5 dosent make suddenly become transformed<br>to a failure or stupid person. Surveys show that people who suffer a higher risk of cancer have a lighter in their house. So lighters cause cancer??<br>Get the correlation right..A poor L1R5 ( not able to get into JC, decide not to go into a JC ) dosent make one stupid...<br><br>I would end to say that even if i could run or swim faster then someone one..It dosent not give me the right to call them "slow"..Get my point?<br><br>Cheers..Chopsticks bundled are stronger <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
