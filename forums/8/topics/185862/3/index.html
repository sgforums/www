It's not the same old English, Maths and Science like what JC students are studying. They do study other subjects as well, but do they have enough knowledge to be applied in the working world?<br><br>Why Republic Poly was opened was just to cope with the high number of dragon babies. Our polys and JCs aren't capable of handling such a high number of students. A few new JCs were opened few years before the dragon babies took their O Levels. It's probably as simple as that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>as i attended a JC b4 n now in poly (dun ask me why i change), i tink i can give a further look inside wad is happening inside in each of the students from the two different category...<br><br>JC:<br><br>firstly, no doubt JC students are so called the "brighter" batch of kids, consisting the top 30% of the cohort every year...u nid L1R5 less den 20 points to get into one.....some go arts stream, some go science stream.....n A level is the ultimate goal for dem....every JC students nid to do well in A level in order to get a place in the three uni in singapore....so as a result, JC students are called "muggers" becoz the A level syllabus is in such a way dat u nid to memorise a lot of content.....plus subjects like econs &amp; maths u nid to tink out of the box in order to score well............<br><br>and the A level cambridge paper has set the paper in such a way dat A level is no longer juz intense memory work.....science subject also requires u to tink a lot when answering essay qns.....plus the SPA thingy dat are introduced in science practical exams are juz one of the moves in order to get JC students tinking.......<br><br>often pple say dey go JC becoz dey do not noe which road they wan to specialise in......<br><br>poly:<br><br>poly diploma are also known as specialization diploma.....dere are often perceptions dat poly is the place when u cant go JC den u go poly.....dat is so entirely wrong becoz A LOT of students even when their L1R5  is below 20 dey still go poly.......<br><br>many pple commented dat poly courses are generally more slacking n less intense.....but however this is not quite true....generally academic wise it is less intense den JC.......but tink abt the projects dat r enough to kill u off!!....n poly education is abt practical approach to skills dat u r learning dat is why u get industrial attachment....becoz wad u learn in poly is wad kind of job u are directly getting in the future!.....<br><br>choosing poly becoz dey noe wad dey wan n which field dat they are interested in??not reallie, some of my frenz dey choose poly for the sake of choosing it and juz simply "grab" a diploma n course to study....dey do not noe  wad dey wan to be in the future actually!!...so u tink pple who go poly are the pple who noe dat wad dey wan to be in the future??....<br><br>conclusion "childish or not":<br><br>dun forget, poly students are made up of pple from a much wider age range yeah??....dere are fresh O level grads who join poly immediately after sec sch, dere are pple who change from JC to poly, dere are pple who are grads from ITE n move up to poly to study (age range would be like 19 to 20 when dey go poly).....n some are pple who choose to go NS first b4 dey go poly....n poly hav an influx of students from other countries like china india malaysia....there is a wide range of diverse of students....<br><br>does dat make JC students seems childish??....absoultely not.....17 years old is when a teenager start to learn and grow....n i admit i hav learnt a lot while i was in JC...and pple arnd the same age makes it a bit easier to communicate with each other, learning from each other's experience.......<br><br>A level is simply do it or die thing.......if dun do well in A level means u wasted two years......a diploma can get u a job while A level cant.....dat is why university hav to give piorities to A level holders....<br><br>condeming a diploma cert??.....in many industries dey nid diploma grads to work!...u imagine, if everybody go do A level den wad will happen to some pple who cant cope with the A level syllabus??....we hav to recognise the fact dat each n every individual is different.....n not forgetting the fact dat many poly diploma students eventually get to university......a degree is of cuz better den diploma cert so dat explains why a lot of pple even though dey hold a diploma cert will find ways n means to get a degree cert......</div>
