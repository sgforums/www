              <p>what can a guy like you expect from me and her? and even if anything hot happens between us, it's our business and not for the likes of clowns like you. Perhaps if you make me happy, i could send you some pics of me in action, and you could probably use those pics as tools to make yourself hard during wanking, which i'm very sure is your fave hobby everyday.</p>
              <p>hey dude, be sure to wash your right hand before you even think of shaking it with me, k? don't wanna get warts on my hands, if you please.</p>

              <p>pooh!  i woulddn't even wanna stoop to such a low despicable level as you are, to actually insult people's little dreams and whatever hopes they have left for themselves.</p>
              <p>yet, it is petty rascals like your good self, with little or failed family upbringing, probably due to early death of parents after giving birth to you, that gave you the ability to laugh at  people's goals in life.</p>
              <p>get a real job?! oh, yes, i've a real job but i'm so free now that i'm surfing SGF 3/4 of the working day. And you? still stuck down there in your 3-room flat with that old crone who adopted you, dreaming of writing the next Harry Potter book?</p>
              <p>good luck, you slimy scum. You've opened my eyes to a whole new world today by showing us that you can actually go to such lengths to crush people's hopes.</p>
              <p>i'm not sure if you'll get hit by a car next Wed or choke on some fishball tomorrow, but i do hope that you'll be like me, and slowly but surely, correct your flaws.</p>
              <p>curse you, Gendaken. you're making me really really incensed now.</p>
              <p>hey, btw, did you hear that sound behind you?!</p>

              <p>It takes a victim like you to make it an issue about crushed hopes.  Somebody with a bit of brains, something hanging between his legs and a modicum of spine would see the message behind it.  If you want to play with the big boys, get your head out of your arse and start figuring out what's happening in the real world.</p>
              <p>The difference between you and me is that you say "I will".  Put "will" in the rubbish bin where it belongs and deal with "am" instead.</p>
              <p>For example, this week, I'm closing a $100,000 project (which is one of my smaller ones) before picking up the keys to my new house on Friday.  What are you doing this week?</p>
              <p>Yeah, I'm an arrogant sonuvabitch, but I'm an arrogant sonuvabitch who walks the walk, and that beats living on fluffy dreams any given day, sonny.</p>

              <p>So why did you go round lying to everyone that Angel was your
              girlfriend?  If, as you now claim, you're the sort to be
              discreet, it was pretty stupid of you to do that, wasn't
              it? </p>
              <p>Liar, liar, pants on fire.  In the bargain you not only
              proved you were a liar but a loser as well - you can't even score a
              guttersnipe like Angel. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Mind you, if the two of you ever did get together, I'd be
              celebrating - the terminally stupid getting together with the
              poisonously classless simply leaves the world a safer place.

              <p>Awww, did I twip over poor widdle Nikar's fwagile ego and bweak

              <p>It takes a victim like you to make it an issue about crushed
              hopes.  Somebody with a bit of brains, something hanging
              between his legs and a modicum of spine would see the message
              behind it.  If you want to play with the big boys, get your
              head out of your arse and start figuring out what's happening in
              the real world.</p>
              <p>The difference between you and me is that you say "I
              will".  Put "will" in the rubbish bin where it belongs and
              deal with "am" instead.</p>
              <p>For example, this week, I'm closing a $100,000 project (which is
              one of my smaller ones) before picking up the keys to my new house
              on Friday.  What are you doing this week?</p>
              <p>Yeah, I'm an arrogant sonuvabitch, but I'm an arrogant
              sonuvabitch who walks the walk, and that beats living on fluffy

              <p>i don't even believe you one bit. apparently, you've plenty of time, like me, to post here, and you're telling me u make big bucks? get real.</p>
              <p>oh yes, you're gonna tell me you'll be having dinner with Warren Buffet, jetting off to France to celebrate Mr. Sarkozy's daughter birthday with their family, then off to London to give financial advice to Mrs. Queen Elizabeth, before coming back to Singapore to feast with Oei Hong Loong?</p>
              <p>i may be living on fluffy dreams which may never materialize, but at least they're not that far away. Sure beats you, who is apparently building celestial castles in thin air. awesome, dude!!!!!!</p>
              <p>and btw, the following paragraph :</p>

              <p>can be translated as :</p>
