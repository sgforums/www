                                              lunch. <br></strong></p>
              <p>my dearest apologies. my family taught me well, and not to feast with gangsters.</p>

              <p><strong>Competing?  How could you possibly hope to compete? 
                                              If I'm going to compete with anyone, it'll always be with someone
                                              who's ahead of me, not miles behind, so don't even fantasise that
                                              there's any chance for you.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Junior, I'm just showing you what you're missing out on. 
                                              Don't go thinking it's a competition because it'll only spell
                                              heartbreak for you.</strong></p>
              <p>the world truly needs more scumbags like you so as to inspire people like me to excel.</p>
              <p>to think of it in a positive light, i probably gotta thank you for making me burn.</p>
              <p>for someone like you who goes on and on trying to destroy other people's hopes shows that your parents didn't taught you well.</p>
              <p>look at straits times Home section today....were u one of those high-achievers whl brutalise your own parents? i hope not.</p>
