            <div class='col-md body'><strong>S'pore, a human-trafficking hotspot? </strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">US State Department report says more than 100 women brought here each year as prostitutes </span><br><br>By Theresa Tan<br><br>SINGAPORE has been cited by the State Department of the United States as having a 'significant trafficking problem'.<br><br>None of the foreigners arrested for prostitution last year were coerced or trafficked in , said the MHA.<br>It said that more than 100 foreign women and girls are being brought here each year to work as prostitutes.<br><br>It is one of 54 countries highlighted as having some way to go in meeting US legal standards in combating human trafficking and it contributes to the 600,000 to 800,000 people being transported illegally across borders worldwide annually.<br><br>Although the Government here acknowledges the existence of human trafficking, it does not consider trafficking for sexual exploitation a major problem, said the Trafficking in Persons 2004 report released in Washington on Monday.<br><br>Singapore was not in the report last year but new information has emerged, showing that last year, it had seven alleged coerced prostitution cases and that 21 youths who were under 18 were detained by the police for being involved in prostitution.<br><br>FEW SUCH CASES HERE, SAYS GOVT<br>A HOME Affairs Ministry spokesman said in a statement last night:<br>'We are puzzled by the placement of Singapore in Tier 2. Singapore does not claim to be absolutely free from the trafficking of girls and women for 'sexual exploitation'. Neither can the United States.<br><br>However, the number of such cases in Singapore is extremely low. In the last three years, 23 cases of alleged trafficking in women were reported, but after intensive police investigations, only one case was substantiated.<br><br>Nevertheless, the Singapore Government takes the issue very seriously...The police arrested about 2,300 female foreigners suspected to be involved in prostitution in 2003. None was found to have been coerced into prostitution or brought in by human traffickers.<br><br>The two cases cited in the US report were actually cases of false representation. The women were cheated with offers of jobs in Singapore. We are studying the US report and will give a more detailed rebuttal of the allegations.'<br><br>The report said some of the women and girls from Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam and China who travel to Singapore voluntarily for prostitution or non-sexual work, were deceived or coerced into 'sexual servitude' here.<br><br>It also said that a small minority of maids work in 'seriously abusive' conditions and in a few cases, the circumstances may amount to 'involuntary servitude'.<br><br>Nations deemed to be complying with US and international efforts to fight trafficking are placed in Tier 1, while those making 'significant efforts' to do so are placed in Tier 2. The least favourable rating is Tier 3.<br><br>Singapore, alongside countries like Cambodia, China and Indonesia, was placed in Tier 2 of the 141 countries rated. And for the first time in its four-year history, the report created a 'Tier 2 Watch List' for countries to receive 'special scrutiny' the next year. Singapore is not on the list.<br><br>The American Embassy told The Straits Times yesterday: 'Trafficking is a problem that needs to be widely tackled by the international community, and we recognise that much work remains to be done in the United States as well.'<br><br>A parallel US Department of Justice June 2004 report shows that the US has a 'significant' problem with human trafficking too.<br><br>The American Embassy also said it maintains an active dialogue with the Singapore Government, which has been very helpful in providing information and insights into the trafficking situation in Singapore.<br><br>However, New Zealand's Foreign Affairs minister has disputed the US report, saying his government has no evidence of children being trafficked into the country for prostitution.<br><br>Meanwhile, its neighbour Australia plans to introduce new laws that set penalties of up to 20 years' jail for smuggling a child.<br><br>In Singapore, the Home Affairs Ministry said the number of women smuggled into Singapore for prostitution is 'extremely small'.<br><br>In frequent raids by the police, all foreign women caught are screened and questioned whether they were forced into the trade, said the ministry spokesman, who added that Singapore also engaged other countries bilaterally, regionally and internationally, to share intelligence on trafficking in women.<br><br>MP Charles Chong, also the chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee on Community Development and Sports, is confident the Government is on top of the situation.<br><br>He said: 'The authorities here don't condone trafficking and sex slavery. If this is a problem here, the Government will definitely look into it. If it doesn't, we will make a big fuss.'</div>
