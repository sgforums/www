            <div class='col-md body'>LOSING one's identity card (IC) can be the start of a nightmare.<br><br>Last Nov 6, my friend left SuperCue Parklane after a game of pool and forgot to collect his IC from the registration booth. About a week later, he received a note in the mail informing him that his IC was with SuperCue Parklane and asking him to collect it.<br><br>He made three trips there on Nov 21 and 22 during which the staff member on duty told him that he had no knowledge of the missing IC. After several fruitless attempts at locating it, the staff member concluded that his IC had been misplaced and offered $100 as compensation for the replacement of the IC.<br><br>Upon his request, a manager of SuperBowl - which owns SuperCue Parklane - provided him with a letter dated Nov 20, confirming the loss of his IC.<br><br>A day later, my friend was shocked to receive two telephone bills from SingTel for mobile phone lines which he did not subscribe to. Checks with the three mobile service providers revealed that three mobile phone lines each from StarHub and SingTel had been registered in his name using his lost IC.<br><br>He made a police report on Nov 23 regarding his lost IC and the fraudulent opening of accounts with the mobile service providers. The accounts were subsequently closed without him having to pay any charges.<br><br>But the nightmare had just begun. A month later, he found two written notes on his front door asking him to pay money he supposedly owed to loan sharks. He had never taken such a loan.<br><br>Two days later, the family woke up to find red paint splashed on the front door. There was also graffiti in the Housing Board lift, stairway and lobby, demanding payment.<br><br>Police reports were made but there is nothing much the police can do to stop the harassment, which is still on-going.<br><br>The negligence of SuperCue Parklane has caused enormous inconvenience to my friend and his family. However, I am also appalled that SingTel and StarHub could have allowed accounts to be opened without proper identity verification.<br><br>I understand that formal complaints will be lodged against the companies and that legal action is also being considered. However, it would take a lot more to allay the fear and ease the frustrations the family faces each day.<br><br>Who would have thought the loss of an IC could have such detrimental effects?<br><br>ANGEL POK (MISS)<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I MOVED into Hougang about a year ago. Recently, I lost my IC.<br><br>One day, I returned home to find that loan sharks had visited my family - paint was splashed on the door and the gate was padlocked.<br><br>We made a police report but were told there was nothing we could do about it and the loan sharks would most probably continue to harass us.<br><br>From what we understand from the police, this is a very common problem and there are at least two cases in every block in Hougang. To me, this is no different from terrorism, just of a different nature.<br><br>Singapore has been commended for its high level of security but when faced with issues like this, why are we helpless? Should our lives be changed henceforth, all because of heartland terrorists like loan sharks? This reminds me of the days of secret societies and mafias.<br><br>My family and I have been traumatised. I am not hoping to seek redress overnight as this is not an easy issue to deal with, but I sincerely hope that the authorities can do something to address a rampant social issue and give us back the peace we once had.<br><br>JASON ANG BENG CHEE<br><br>- ST<br><br>[/quote]<br><br>be warned!</div>
