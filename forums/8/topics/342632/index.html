              <p>Yeah, I thought as much, they would rather chase away someone who has not much of a choice but to spend 3 years there, and more than 30K a year in their country on school fees and such.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>don't say there lah, even in singapore we have singaporean being racist against singaporeans, just look at how we behave in sg forums.</p>
              <p>but when i was in australia treatment was generally ok, service much better than what you get in sg, just that people do stare at you and you get the occasional person shunning you.</p>

              <p>Years ago at Mineapolis in the winter of year 1999.</p>
              <p>I went to USA with a group of more than 10 Singaporeans to attend a university seminar in Kansas. Our flight stopped over at Mineapolis and we had our passport stamped at the airport before hopping into a domestic flight to our final destination. </p>
              <p>There was only 1 queue at the custom initially and the queue was long.  After a while, a new counter was opened and I rushed to that counter to have my passport stamped.  The original counter where I was queue-ing for was manned by a laozarbo, a grey hair caucasian lady.  The newly opened counter was by a young man. </p>
              <p>Then hor, all my friends who queued up at the 1st counter all kenna detained by the laozarbo.  She questioned every Singaporean traveller why they were there.  My friends, even after producing documents from the university, got detained by her for no reason.  When the young man was stamping my passport, he did not even ask any question.  But the lao zar bo shouted across and told him to detain me as well.  The young man ignored her totally, didn't even bother to look at her.  He just stamped and told me to go.  </p>
              <p>My poor friends were brought to their office and were not allowed to leave.  There were other officers there and they all wondered and asked one another why my group of friends were detained.  They just wanted to release my friends.  But as a formality, they just made a call to the university to confirm what my friends have explained.  When they told my friends that they could leave, the laozarbo came in and said,"No, they can't leave!"  One of her colleagues said,"They are just here to attend the seminar!"  She said,"Are you sure?"  He replied,"Yes, I called the university to verify."  so the woman bo bian. </p>
              <p>According to my friends, from what they noticed from the officers' reaction on seeing them being retained, this was not the first time (probably x number of times already) that the woman was doing this to travellers. </p>
              <p>Not sure whether she dun like Singaporeans, Chinese or all Asians. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To end this story.... I would like to say... I sincerely hope.....</p>
              <p>this woman....</p>
              <p>gets raped by terrorist!  Tamade!</p>

              <p>When was in Brisbane, taking a ride on a tourbus.  Some angmoh kids in a beat up car drove near to us, shouted at us and spit at the moving bus on the highway.  Cant hear them so well cos the bus is aircon, and most of us was sleeping anyway.  Its maybe only me looking out my window seat to see that.</p>
              <p>In Perth, was followed by some white boys in a old fashioned van; while we are in a rented car.</p>
              <p>The boys tried to tailgate us, shouting thru the windows and waving rude gesture with their hands out the window.</p>
              <p>Again, windows are shut and we cant hear them that well.  But it obvious, they are picking on us because we are asians in a rented car.</p>

              <p>Ya, many dunno where Singapore is.  When we stayed in Days Inn at LA, the innkeeper actually thought we were PRC citizens even though we did produce our passport when we checked in.  I didn't know they thought we were PRC until I asked about using the phone to call overseas.  The innkeeper kept telling me that I have to dialing country code 861.  I was wondering what the hell is 861 calling code.  Later then I realised 861 was china code.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I think for custom officers in North America (U.S &amp; Canada), the rule of thumb for travelers is to fill up your declaration forms and have present with you the necessary documentation. Don't give them any reason to find fault with you because these officers are either plain nice or plain nasty. I've entered Canada quite a number of times, and with a Singapore passport it's always been easy. Most of my friends who experience any excessive questioning usually are the ones who failed to fill up their declaration forms properly or have problems with their documentation. As for the States, I think it is much easier now given the Visa-Waiver program, in where we are classified with other first world nations. Some people might find the photographing part a little disorientating, but when I entered the States thru the U.S-Canada land border a few weeks ago, they are now using a webcam to snap pictures of travelers. So it makes the process seem a lot less intrusive. I guess as with everywhere you go, there will be the segment of the population who will take exception to the fact that you are of a race different from them. I got shout down by a bunch of drunken native people in Canada once for being Chinese, but I've also encountered really sweet native people who are deeply curious about Singapore and our culture. So instead of seeing it as a matter of race, in the end, it is just a matter of individuals who are willing to accept and embrace other cultures, and those who just blatantly refusing to for one reason or another.</p></div>

              I have only been in Aust/nsw/ not Sydney btw  for only 2 months but i have been abused twiced already , but on both occasions i was farking drunk n stoned so i had the balls to f them off  , btw im a indian but not tamil looking
                                                              
              And yah the chinese ppl get it worst here , recently a friend of mine from brazil who looked middle-eastern , got abused by a 17 or 18 yr old girl (its schoolies month) she called him terrorist and asking him to f off and when he replied f off , the girls bf and his friends came over and punched his face , my friend`s other 3 friends joined in and in the end they got wacked by more then 15 kids &amp; in the end all 4 had to spend the night in hospital .
                          
              But , majority of Australians are nice ppl , they say hi to you when they walk pass you , and its very common to make small talks with strangers here in Australia(young &amp; old) , and on many occasions it ended up with a topic about , girls , beer , partying and marijuana and of cos when you are high , Politics will be the main topic &amp; Yah non of the Australians i talked to like the idea of the death penalty in Singapore and the freedom the ruling party in singapore gives us.
