              <p>My condolences.....</p>
              <p>I had an experience...although I am not sure what was the motive....</p>
              <p>I was riding in a car with my relative, a distant uncle, somewhere in Australia, I cannot remember now, I think Sydney or nearby...it was a red light stop......suddenly a group of young males in a car next to us, threw their drinks and made obscene gestures and yelled...and then sped away when the light turned green and the cars started moving.</p>
              <p>I was abit shocked but my uncle didnt seem to react. Maybe it was common or a kind of road culture there..? I mean just from this thread there are several others victims of this road rage. Such thing would never happen in Singapore.</p>

Yes, a bunch of kids yelled and made obscene gestures directed at you can't possibly be because they're rowdy teens, it has to be racism, no other explanation. Just because you're Asian doesn't mean that whenever somebody mistreats you it's because of that reason.

              <p>Eg.</p>
              <p>Work in a german company.  You will never see a asian ascending to VP level or Senior Management Level.</p>
              <p>Same with some American Companies.  Its fairly subtle so you wont actually see that they leave only angmohs as senior management.  Or that the local engineers that are doing great things for the company, are receiving pay package then a new greenhorn angmoh in the same post.</p>
              <p>And they never allow the angmohs to be the subordinate.  Give a excuse to say they are there to learn.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Russia is closed to China, and their living standards not as good as China people, so they have some respect for Asians.</p>

              <p>Cough....plenty who want to pretend otherwise.</p>
              <p>Got plenty of Indian fellas, came from India, pretending to be angmohs.</p>
              <p>One pretended to be a caucasian american doing his NS in Singapore because he got Singapore parents.  Actual fact, his family is from India PR in Singapore.  He doing National Service so can become Singaporean, then he wants to go US to study.</p>
              <p>Another one I encountered is a young teenage boy in UK. He keep insisting he is from the United Kingdom and gave us a impression that he is English. Actual fact his parents are from Sri Lanka.  And yes, he is born in UK so that made him English?</p>
              <p>Anyway, I acknowledge myself as Singaporean Chinese, in japan speak its "Singaporu Chu kok ku Jin".  Direct translation is Singapore China person.</p>

              <p>it's amazing the number of young people here who speaks with a terrible, confused, quasi american slang though the furthest and longest they might have been overseas might have been that 7 days vacation in perth ...</p>
              <p>speaking of overseas examples, there's this fellow I met in pluto ... right from the start, at the dinner party, I thought there was something odd about the fellow, seemed cold, hostile even, and he spoke with that extremely affected, exaggerated accent some asians living in ang moh countries use on their own kind whom they thought were FOBs .....</p>
              <p>twas only later I realized, when someone else told me about it, that the chap was originally from Singapore too ... </p>
              <p>I guess he might have been afraid of being found out about whatever bullshit he's been telling other people about Singapore ...</p>

              <p>I will always remember this story of this Singapore Backpacker.</p>
              <p>She was in some hostel at some angmoh country.</p>
              <p>Two angmoh girls was asking her where she is from.  They didnt understand Singapore, so Singapore girl try to suggest that Singapore is south of Thailand and Malaysia.</p>
              <p>Two angmoh girls then gives her knowing looks.</p>
              <p>Much later Singapore girl realised that the two angmoh girls have associated Thailand with prostitutions and thus regard Singapore as part of Thailand's....</p>

              <p>I speak with angmoh twang!</p>
              <p>Ok.....in Seattle, fren was pointing out that I use Singlish speak and I can never be mistaken for American. (Errr....do I really want to be American?  Why didnt anyone consider that I am happy as a tourist?)</p>
              <p>However, I kinda remember its because of the time spent with someone else at Sandiego that I managed to be able to speak Singlish in Angmoh land.</p>
