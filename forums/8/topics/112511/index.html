Holy Fuck, if she has half a brain, she would have figured out that even without doing any homework, I was still getting 100 for everything, whereas she is struggling with her schoolwork after having done all her homework. but she just likes to kaobehkaobu, probably feels proud of herself for getting others into trouble.<br><br>then last year I was living in some apartment. got this old Bitch living underneath me. everyday she likes to keep poking her ceiling, which is my floor, just because I was walking around in my house.  how much sound can that make? but she just likes to poke the floor, which makes so much noise and was so damn irritating. there was once she even called up the apartment manager to complain that I was "always making loud noises" and the apartment manager just told her to Shut the Fuck Up and move if she didnt like it. later the apartment manager told me that she asked the Bitch to STFU, I was laughing so hard. the society needs more people like my apartment manager.</div>

Holy Fuck, if she has half a brain, she would have figured out that even without doing any homework, I was still getting 100 for everything, whereas she is struggling with her schoolwork after having done all her homework. but she just likes to kaobehkaobu, probably feels proud of herself for getting others into trouble.<br><br>then last year I was living in some apartment. got this old Bitch living underneath me. everyday she likes to keep poking her ceiling, which is my floor, just because I was walking around in my house.  how much sound can that make? but she just likes to poke the floor, which makes so much noise and was so damn irritating. there was once she even called up the apartment manager to complain that I was "always making loud noises" and the apartment manager just told her to Shut the Fuck Up and move if she didnt like it. later the apartment manager told me that she asked the Bitch to STFU, I was laughing so hard. the society needs more people like my apartment manager.</div></blockquote>cool.. now i know how to post the word Fuck without it turning into this-&gt;fuck<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
