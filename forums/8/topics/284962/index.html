            <div class='col-md body'>Here's how the story goes...<br><br>In 1997, in Atlanta, USA, an university Business School Dean, let called it Dean A, were criticized by four of his school professors, known as the Gang of 4.<br><br>The gang alleged that Dean A was ineffective, unable to attract more sponsorship to the school, school declining reputation etc.<br><br>After meeting with the university President, Provost and the gang of 4, the Provost issued a statement hinting Dean A had not performed up to expectation and losing the confidence of his subordinates. However, they(President and Provost) fell short of sacking the dean.<br><br>After which, some matters happened to one of the professor in the gang of 4.<br>The business school actually underwent some period of turmoil. In the end, Dean A decided to pack his bag and resigned.<br><br>Any idea where he went after his resignation? There maybe a link with some of us...<br><br>Answer will be out soon...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"After five years at Krannert, he accepted the appointment of Dean at Emory University in Atlanta. During the nine years he was at Emory, <span style="color: red;">the school ranking in US News and World Report rose substantially from 31 to 21, and from an unranked school in Business Week to one of the top 25 business schools. He initiated key fund-raising efforts which led to the naming of the school for Roberto C. Goizueta (then chairman and CEO of the Coca-Cola Company) in response to a US$10 million gift from the Robert W. Woodruff Foundation. Under his management, the endowment increased dramatically from US$5m in 1989 to US$65m in 1998, including a US$20m donation each from the Estate of Roberto C. Goizueta and the Robert W. Woodruff Foundation. An additional US$26.5m was raised during the same period to completely fund and fully equip an entire new physical and information technology facility for the school which was inaugurated in late 1997.</span> After retiring in 1998, he remains a much sought-after marketing consultant. He has been a prolific writer of marketing articles, books and journals, and for over a decade, he was the fourth most cited author in marketing."<br><br></div>
