            <div class='col-md body'>to Demonsbane...<br><br>I was juss tokking about this subject with my GF the other day about the difference in USA west and British/French west...Big Difference....altho we hear about reacism coming from America so much, the truth of the matter is that in Europe, the racism is quite possibly higher and more blatantly open than in USA...You only hear more from the USA because their damn news engines can churn out  news like nobody's business...<br><br>AS most people who know me well enuff from this forum know...My dad is british American and I've been to Britain and altho I have a romanticised view of that country (from reading all his british story books)...we encountered so much racism and bigotry there that it wasn't funny...and we only stayed there for a month and a half...:-(  We got rejected from hotels in the countrysides and stuff like that...or restaurants wouldn't take us because we were asians...<br><br>Needless to say that not everyone of them is like this, but I found that I encountered more rude British and French people than rude american people...I'm not trying to defend americans here because I know some things they do are deplorable,. but juss want to say....<br><br>I read a few years ago that the british, French and Aussies actually rated the Americans as the most polite, curteous, and gracious people living in Singapore or that they've met before....as compared to their own people...I was shocked to read this(altho I had a thot that it was true already anyway), but even the British admitted that It was the Americans who gave the Expatriates a good name and image, but everyone else who ruins that image and the americans get blamed for always casuign trouble......<br><br>If you know the History of Britain and America,you'll know the long time rivalry betweent he two countries...:-)so for them to even admit this is very astonishing for me...<br><br>Anyway, i hope that it answered your questions a little bit on why your friend? encountered such a situation in London...<br><br>Just a note...i love british people...:-)almost better than americans:-)  dun know why...I juss do...:-)must be the accent:-)<br><br>to everyone else....<br><br>I hope that you dun take my long posts as juss ramblings...I like to give examples so that what I say isn't just out of thin air...so if anyone gets offended...sorry, but keep that in mind tho...:-)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let's put this way. If one doesn't show respect to the other , then the other doesn't. Since there are some people who doesn't think of others before himself, they do what they like. They think that no one will go up against them. But seriously though, many others affected don't really want to fight it out.<br>I still think people aren't bothered with such things anyway.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why the difference for attitude of pple in different country different region?? Have anyone analysed?<br><br>Could i say that it's the social culture shaped by the government that make it different? Why is singaporean so ugly?? Singapore society had make singaporean a apathetic lots who care only for themselve in everyday life leading to all the mentioned ugly scenerios. Does anyone agree?<br><br>Diverting a little as an overviewer of the singapore's government move, singapore is no longer just a home for singaporean. Foreign workers come in flock to stay, work and leave as they want. Singapore government stressing the need for foreign talents to help build up economy. What is the value of local talent to them?<br><br>Singaporean had stepped down to be the 2nd class citizen to some extent. MPs are putting blame on local young generation as they live only for today. When our local pillar are looked down upon as a consumer instead of a constructor, when the capable cannot speak up, be heard and can do nothing, when our young generation just cannot be bothered to question the future but care only to enjoy today to their fullest. What can the rest of the population do? Apathetic is the word. Selfishness to the extreme. Everyone might adopt the mentality that just care about their own life, why bother whether others suffers.<br><br>Once the train door open, you can see pple among are singaporeans and foreigners rushing in to grab the seat. Such mentality linger within their head that if they don't rush in, they will have to stand or can't even board the train and hence lose out. The foreigner's thinking: "why should I care since i just working here, after getting rich i just go back to my homeland to enjoy." The local's thinking might be: "I'm not going to lose out. Everyone's doing the same"<br><br>Some might questions why is the train always so crowded, why suddenly singapore became so crowded. well, that's the work of our father government in the name for economy advancement despite of all the possible social problems. They also urge singaporean to make it comfortable for the foreigner to come work and live in singapore, so wat do you think?</div>
