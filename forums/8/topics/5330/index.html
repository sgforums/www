            <div class='col-md body'>Oh man...something I really feel for...(but then again u all probably think I have an opinion about everything hah?...kapo firewire!!!):-)....<br><br>Just last month when I had time to watch a movie...I heard so many pagers and fones ring that it wasn't funny...there was this one guy(I guess about late 30s from what i could tell)..he was sitting a few seats away from me and my friend..and his fone kept going off every few minutes...everyone was like..*tsk* *tsk*, but he just never shut it off...ok, bad enuff, but some more he also answers his call like it's his own house then start talking about stock market and s**t...Then i think his wife call (or maybe GF)...and he start talking about how his groceries before going back home...AS u Singaporeans would say," Wah Liao!!!!!"  What gives man...<br><br>Then this one guy another time was a bit better...his fone rang, then he ran to the toilet behind the curtain (at Lido), I thot ,"ahh, now this is a guy that knows his manners..."<br><br>Then all of a sudden u hear him speak like Hell!!!!The guy answer his fone like an ahbeng...ALLO!!! ALLO!!!  wEI!!! then started to shout into his fone about something about meeting his friends later...again,"Wah Liao!!!!"  Then a bunch of girls shouted hella loud, "Shut the Hell up in the toilet there!!!"  Then he shut up...but unfortunately other pagers and handfones still ring....Since handfones and pagers have become mainstream in Singapore, I haven't been to one show yet(and I go to them a lot!)where I didn't hear fones and pages...From the front middle and rear of the theatre...<br><br>I don't kno why...i always turn my fone off...i got so angry wiff my stupid friend  (local guy)....half way thru the movie he starts to play with his fone for 5 or ten minutes  and never bother to switch the volume off for his buttons...beep beep beep!!!Was all I heard...Lucky he stopped before I took his fone from himm...I was getting pretty fed up.....<br><br>Then this one time, These 5 or 6 aunties were sitting behind me during the Haunting, and they just kept talking like in the market ior something..Everyone was so pissed off...I kept yelling to them to not talk, but they kept quiet for about a minute before starting again...I was so exasperated already...becasue the movie sucked (typical hollywood movie...no flair all specialEFFX no storey)...and these aunties that kept talking...<br><br>so yeah i kno what u r talking about....Do these people think it's cool or what?  good way to get attention hah?  I tried to figure out what it could be...still stumped...anyone have any theories iinto this....?<br><br>and just this morning as I was going to get out of the lift, this lady at my block just charged her way in...these lift doors are quite small and my shoulders quite big...so u can see that i couldn't get out...she justy looked aty me and kept walking in while I tried to get out...how uttterly rude...but of cos I managed to get out...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some suggested solution :<br><br>1. For Handphones/Pagers in Cinema.<br><br>Suggest to TAS (Telecommunication   Authority of Singapore) or Cinema Operator to remove those signal within the cinema. So that all the phones inside will be "No Network" displayed.<br><br>2.  For those ppl who doesn't shift into the vacant space within the MRT.<br><br>I guessed u just have to learned to be like Lumu (from ALL Blacks) and dashed your way through.<br><br>Alternatively, u can just let go a fart that make them give way to u.<br><br>3.  For those ppl who LEAN AGAINIST the pole that is mean for holding.<br><br>Wear those rings with spike on it and hold it on the pole.

Let's face it, that's what rudeness and uncurteous-ness is...selfishness because one only wants to think only of himslef...a very asian value that we still have buried deeply in our pshyche...<br><br>It will change only if our core values start to change by process of re-evaluation...<br><br>in other words...ne society...learn to adapt or live like an idiot...:-(<br><br>hope this means anything...Am i on the right track?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Have to agree of what u all have said. There was a time, in a crowded MRT. It was in the morning, pple who were sitting, just pretend to be asleep and refused to give up their seats to the poor pregnated lady, who was just standing for quite sometime....Some trademark of good O' Singaporean....ya?<br><br>To ugly but adorable,<br><br>you claimed to be nice and courteous person, but u acted rudely to that guy. Aren't u a bit of contradictng yrself? HA!(no hard feeling? just a comment....)<br><br>[This message has been edited by takumi (edited 27-11-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>All have been said so much..so what is the solution??None. I believe none is going to do anything about this. The uncanny is everyone is aware of this social problem but there is nothing we can do about it.It is the society's problem.What a shame...!Graceful??Has ever the government ever sit down to think about these problems which seems so close to out heart.They are only concerned about the economy and how SG is going to be one of the best in E-Commerce and IT.<br><br>So, I hope after everyone reading this thread, start a trend for the forumites to show gracefulness in this society. One makes a difference. Be the first one tommorow morning to give up a sit to someone who needs it.Help the disability to cross the road.If you see a disabled hailing for a taxi, please if u are not in a rush,kindly send him/her to the destination they want to go. SG does not have the transport facilities.Be compassionate abd U will be rewarded.To help is to receive. Actions speak louder than words.<br>Dun worry...I have done all the above countless of times and i gurantee that U will not regret for what u have done<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Frankly speaking, I think we are a bit inconsiderate. I switch my phone to silent mode when I am in the cinema. Now they have silent modes on phones and pagers, is it too much to ask if they just call them back after the shows?<br>Driving in singapore is no fun as well! U see a lot of people parking illegally or stopping suddenly without warning.<br>Few people signal now a days. I am comparing this attitude with Australia. When I drove over there, I signalled and people gave way. People signal and do not cut lanes as often as us! What's more, when taking the bus, they actually thank the bus driver when they got off! That is very nice!<br>Of course compared to china, our road users and conditions are much better. Let's put it this way,  if given a chance to drive in china, I would rather walk or take a cab!<br>But all in all, this is where I call home!</div>
