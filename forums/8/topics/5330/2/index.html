            <div class='col-md body'>The pasture is always greener on the other side. And sometimes, the people we are most critical abt is ourselves.  I can't believe the Singaporeans who have replied have never defended ourselves.  Yes, it is true that there are some Singaporeans who are inconsiderate, maybe even a lot.  But for everyone  there is another who is considerate.  It is always easy to see the faults of others.  Becoz we are always looking out for them.  Its like when we see others fall we feel superior.  That is why we always spot the mistakes of others and never the good points.  Myabe dat is why we see Singaporeans as mostly inconsiderate bunch of poeple.  Not to be personal , but i think people like firewire , and others may have been inconsiderate before and people probably are saying the same things abt them as they have said abt other people.  Sometimes the splinter in other peoples' eyes could be a reflection of the logs in ours?i don't think its juz singapore who has inconsiderate people .  every country has.<br>maybe we seem to have more.  but this is only becoz it seems. and also it may be cool to agree that singaporeans are inconsiderate, like it is a stereotype.  but stereotypes are never accurately.  everyone in this world is selfish.  and it takes a consciuos effort not to be so.maybe singpaoreans have not been that conscious, but u can't say we are not trying.  people who say others are selfish are selfish themselves.  let me explain.  when someone inconvenience me i say the person is selfish , becoz he or she has not thought abt me.  but since ultimately i am concern abt other people having to think abt my welfare does that not make me selfish too, think abt it.  Got to go.  Hey, I'm proud to be a Singaporean.  and yes i may be selfish inconsiderate at times, but i do feel guilty and never try to make the same mistake twice.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I just watched Talking point yesterday(quite a coinkidink that this topic is here then on TV too)...But there were definately many more people calling in and saying how rude and inconsiderate Singaporeans are...even the people who called in to "defend' singaporeans didn't qutie defend them...they said things like we can't look to the WEst to mold our own way of being considerate and gracious...we should try to make our own version of graciousness and consideration...<br><br>my only answer to that is....," ??? "<br><br>What does it mean to have our own version of consideration and graciousness...Yes, there are things that asians have that is considered polite by asian standards..such as calling elders uncle or auntie...things like that..(callers also said that they believed that in the west, most children call their parents by their first names...)....<br><br>Firstly, being there most of my life, very few people call their parents by their first names...most children and teens call their parents mom or dad...and they call older people Mr, and Mrs...The majority...those ones who don't are in the major minority....(kekekek  hope it makes sense):-)...Now being from there, and being here for 7 years, I have had a chance to experience both ways of life and graciousness and politeness...<br><br>To be frank, Singaporeans are rude and inconsiderate...there's no way that you can defend it...you can defend it on the grounds that you might be singaporeans so cannot lose face so must defend,...but ultimately you defend a sham...it's false...I lived in San francisco, which is extremely crowded...if you think your MRTs are crowded, you should go overseass...the buses and trains are even more infrequent and inefficient, yet you will hardly ever encounter rude people or assholes...altho I have run into a few...a few in 17 years there is a very small number...When people know that they are in your space, they will apologize and smile to acknowledge that they know it's their fault...and they might even talk you up..or if you talk to them, they will talk back to you and be very friendly at that too...<br><br>try doing any of that in Singapore...Even when you say sorry here, the person still looks at you like you owe him/her money...I know most of you encounter this before...:-)  I seen and encountered it so many time...you can even count them by weeks....:-)<br><br>Ever saw this girl accidentally bump another working lady's shoes...very lightly...I was standing right next to them...and the lady started to overexaggerate by sayiong, "OW!!!...That Hurt!!!...TSK TSK"...The girl was so sincere in saying sorry and repeated it so many times, but the lady just kept giving her that look like she owed her money for the shoes and the pain to her foot and she kept on saying *tsk* *tsk*...It was all bullshit of course...she barely tapped the ladye's shoe...the thick sole kind...<br><br>On to the point...There is no such thing as the grass is greener on the other side...When it is a subject as this...you only give in to the inevitable by defending yourself...When so many people complain already there must be something wrong...We are so developed here in Singapore, yet we still don't know how to say sorry, thank you, get up for elderly...blah blah blah...everyone still thinks for themselves...well, almost everyone...:-)<br><br>and it isn't selfishness to expect that others acknowledge your existence...When someone steps over your dignity or personal space and acts like nothing happened, it makes you feel like they consider you insignifigant...no consideration for your feelings or anyone elses...Now the problem here also is that a lot of Singaporean cannot accept apologies from strangers either...like stated above...so it is a double edge thing...Even you say, people will most likely be less inclined to accept or forgive you...<br><br>Everyone wants to be acknowledged in some way...You cannot go through life blowing everyone off like they didn't exist...It isn't the Genghis Khan dynasty anymore...We are supposed to be civilised...<br><br>There is no such thing as western politeness or graciousnes...or asian politeness or graciousness...It is a universal thing..there are instances of differences, but polite is still polite and rude is still rude...<br><br>You don't go and shout at someione in the face and not consider it rude...almost every race in the world will pummel you into an inch of your life if you do that...It is very rude and inconsiderate.....<br><br>and is there an asian way to be considerate when you go out?...besides calling people auntie and uncle (but westerners call others Mr., and Mrs)...there is no such thing...if your pager or fone rings in a theatre, people will be peeeved off...they will think your inconsiderate and rude...especailly if you answer the fone...arg:-8<br><br>Let me reiterate again that it is a universal thing(grqaciousness and consideration) and cannot be separated into WEstern or asian categories...when u boil it down, it's all the same...we all just want some respect and consideration...and I'd like to believe that everyone would like to give it also, but many just don't know how...<br><br>Have I ever been rude or inconsiderate? On this forum, yes...in real life, extremely rarely..and when I am it's a reaction to something else that really gets me sngry...and that doesn't happen often...:-)...In my 7 years in Singapore, my friends have only ever seen me get angry once...and that was a reaction to a guy beating up his gf and trying to attack me for trying to help...kapo?  maybe, concerned? yes...<br><br>And i'd like to say thanks to the person who called the police post just now for his/her civic mindedness...I just encountered a girl beating up a guy (a really big malay girl beating up a really skinny malay guy)...I called the police but he told me that they had already sent some men...altho it is a bit off point, It still felt good to know that someone out there cared what was happening to someone else...:-)  poor guy...:-)<br><br>So yes, we do have good people in Singapore, I think that many people find it difficult to show this kind of thing to others besides their own family...They just don't know how to articulate/express themselves...and it is only just a matter of time...I hope...From my time in Singapore 1992-1999...I have noticed a considerable improvement in how people interact with each other in public...A very considerable difference...that's why I an say that it will improve over time...Either the campaigns are finally working, or Singaporeans are beginning to realise that this is how they want to be treated so they shall treat others this way...I am very happy for this change....sooo juss wait and everyone juss try a bit harder...and it will come time when we can say that we are finally there...:-)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the best principle to use here would be not to do unto others what you want them to do to you.<br><br>I won't disagree that some Singaporeans are rude, but I'll say that people in other countries are not that good either. The probability of you meeting some inconsiderate rude bastard is the same as that in Singapore.<br><br>Just to name a few examples, some of the old people in Australia push and shove up their way to a bus, some even ask people to stand up to give up their seat. Others will bang you with the shopping trolley if you don't move that extra 2 cm towards the cashier.<br>Yet other will walk between you and your friend when you are talking even when two thirds of the pavement is empty. And when he/she trips, he/she will turn back and shout at you for tripping her.<br><br>Younger people can hurl abuse at you in a passing car, or put their feet up your ass in a lecture theatre.<br><br>In one of China's airlines which shall remain nameless, Chinese passengers will reach over to your seat and grab whatever reading material is in the seat pocket without even acknowledging your existence. Others will ask you to move to another seat because they want to lie across the seats in your row.<br><br>In the cities itself, people will hit you with their luggage trolleys to make you go forward. Everyone does that, no matter who. Except foreigners though. When buying stuff, if you queue up, forget about getting your stuff. Its a taken that you have to push other people away to get to the front.<br><br>All of the above I have experienced. You decide if we are worse than other people.<br><br>Most importantly though, don't be rude to other people yourself, because like almost all the posters, we hate it when someone else do the wrong things.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>considering the discussion topic....<br><br>Seriously, Sub aren't u guilty at times of the offences that u slam upon "True blue Singaporeans"...don't ur mama call while u are in the cinema/ ur galfren page u in the midst of viewing a fantastic movie? From ur tone, I suppose u r second class PR citizen. A real Singaporean may criticise but wouldn't put down. If you are really unhappy, you can give up your PR status and go somewhere where the grass is greener and enjoy the "summer rain" maybe back to your hometown where everyone speaks great canto? So stop complaining and live with it...or else,bury urself in dirt and earth, living in seclusion for the rest of ur life!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is my first time posting on this board. Before this I was always content just reading and observing from the bylines, but I feel that I have to have my say regarding this topic.<br><br>To tetrutetrumon:<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;So many ppl complainted abt pagers and handphones rang in a movie... but think abt this - The whole cinema consist of almost 200++ ppl while some jokers like 2-5 ppl's pager/handphone rang in the midst of the show. And that makes Singaporean utterly rude? Pardon me, but I think it's hilarious for such thinking&lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>You're missing the point completely. I'm studying in the US now, Bay area to be exact. I watch on average 2 shows per week in the cinema, either in San Francisco or Oakland or wherever I feel like watching at that particular moment.<br><br>I watch a LOT of movies.<br><br>In all the time I watch movies here, NEVER have ANYONE's pagers or handphones gone off in the middle of a show. EVER. I've stayed here for 1 year, and at 2 shows per week (I'm a real movie buff), that'd equate to about 100 movies, which translates into thousands of people here, and not ONE of them is inconsiderate enough to leave their handphones or pagers on during showtime, let alone actually answer their calls.<br><br>What does this say about singaporeans?<br><br>Mind you, bay area people are quite notorious for carrying handphones and pagers and such, not unlike people in singapore.<br><br>I remember watching movies in singapore. I don't think I'd be exaggerating much to say that in every movie that I watch, there will always be a pager or handphone going off, and someone answering these said handphones without stepping out of the theater are not rare exceptions.<br><br>I watch just as many movies in S'pore as I'm watching now (average of 2 per week).<br><br>Are you trying to say that it's always the same 2-5 people who leave their pagers or handphones on in the cinema? That these "pager people" skulk the s'pore cinemas, trying their best to ruin the image of s'poreans in general to pursue some hidden agenda?<br><br>Please stop posting with blind ideology. Try moving abroad one of these days. You'd be surprised at the amount of considerations you'll receive from total strangers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not here to debate about the origins of Singaporeans' bad behaviour. Really don't think blaming anyone is the best of solutions. What we should keep in mind now, is to constantly observe our own actions and speech. Try the "putting yourself into our people's shoes" mentality. It works.<br><br>Read through most of the replies in detail. The MRT subject really urged me to post this reply. Just typing this for interest sake. I've politely asked people to move into unoccupied space on trains and buses many times before. Most of the time, people comply and move in, but I note the way they do it. Frankly, I've never seen anyone move in with a smile and a "sorry". Many even do it grudgingly. Sometimes, in an attempt to dissolve my anger caused by such bad mannerism, I would imagine those people hogging the exit being plastered to the door. Something along the lines of Ally McBeal's eccentric inner world. I would then be smiling idiotically to myself in the midst of grumpy, after-work faces, and go my merry little way after that.<br><br>Hmm..this sets me on another line of thought. Ok, off I go to post a new topic!<br><br>P/S: Btw, I didn't see/feel any sense of the so-called "self-righteousness" in firewire's posting. Don't really get why vanish accused him of that. Anyway, maybe vanish could justify his comments a little more next time.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hugoboss... why bother doing Pascal in 1999?<br><br>anyway.. samehere man... they should introduce contrary frequencies that interfere's with cell phone frequency in the cinema. that way.. you can't receive fone calls and make calls (i doubt no one is inconsiderate enuff to CALL someone during the movie, if there are.... hopeless hopeless).<br><br>not only cellphones and pagers.... some damned ppl would bring laser pointers to the theatre and point it to obscure places of the actors.<br><br>oh man... what a disgrace.</div>

It was for that vanish guy.<br><br>I still stand by my statement that although it is true that 2-5 people out of 200+ people does not constitute a majority, there is still a much higher percentage of rude S'poreans compared to people of other culture (except Hongkong, China and the rest of these countries). In the end, that is what matters: a higher percentage of rude and inconsiderate people in a particular culture makes for a rude and inconsiderate culture as a whole.<br><br>Again, I apologize for flaming you by mistake (yes, I'm an idiot). I like your optimism, and was definitely not referring to that when I mentioned the "blind ideology" thingumy.<br><br>Cheers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I know I'll be crucified if I say it.  But I'll still say it.  I think the government should fine those whose handphones ring in cinemas.

            <div class='col-md body'>I dun really think that fines would work. It's really infringing on the autonomy of people to fine anyone whose phone rings in the middle of a movie. Naming and shaming would be a better deal. I for one would love to walk up to those AhBengs with handphones that look like christmas tree lights on Speed  and say, 'You are a disgrace to your parents for the poor upbringing that you have. Switch off the phone before we stuff it up your @$$.'<br><br>Ah Bengs only know one language: INTIMIDATION. They won't listen to reason...they'd only go 'You which Gang one?'<br>If you try to tell them nicely to take the call outside, they'd say 'You which Gang one?' If you tell them to switch off their handphones because its inconsiderate to disturb the rest of the Cinema, they'd reply 'YOU WHICH GANG ONE?'<br><br>I seriously advocate visiting glorious violence on these dregs of society and pummelling them into submission not unlike what we call 'Blanket Party' in the Army, but what the hey we don't do that anymore right?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">Or do we? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

Unlike in the 1950s and 1960s, these new generation bengs would run at first sight of POLICE. Cowards cowards.<br><br>At least the beng culture has somewhat died down lately, unlike those times in 1995-1997. Wow man, beng-mania. I think the economic depression brought them down. ahahahaha<br><br>x-mas tree handphones, oh man, why degrade the handphone's reception by switching to non-orginal parts. but somehow it is better, since degrading the recepetion would somehow cut down their chances of receivign a call in a cinema. heheh<br><br></div>
