            <div class='col-md body'>Hello, is your screw up there loose or what?? if we dun give them a push in the right direction, how do you expect them to get out of the poverty trap. If they really go down, the govt will have a handful of problem to deal with, at that time, what will be spend on them will be far greater.<br><br>Furthermore, when govt give them money, the economy will have more money to flow through. U understand this formula<br><br>AE = C+I+G+(IM-EX)<br><br>AE = Aggregate Expenditure<br>C = Consumer Spending<br>I = Investment<br>G = Govt spending<br>IM = Import<br>EX = Export<br><br>In this case the govt is also trying to give the economy a push by driving up C which inturn will have a multiplying effect on the economy and also helping the poor and also the less mentionable election. It killing 3 birds with one stone. When economy improve, we will have jobs.<br><br>when AE go up, the eocnomy get better and when AE go down, it the opposite<br><br>The only way out for them is for their children to be better educated and obtain higher paying job. as for the parent, they will need to adapt and learn new and better skill to hold onto a job, Singapore is heading toward lower labour and higher capital intensive industry. if those parent dun upgrade, they will be eliminated and the cycle will continue on and on and on.<br><br>Though it true that some of them will not be bother to upgrade themseleves to stay employed but we will need to save as many as we can.<br><br>So thread starter, before you condemn anything, kindly reflect upon yourself first and get your basic understanding of the working mechanism of economy right first before commenting.<br><br>Peace to all</div>
