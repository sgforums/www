            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Ponders:</div><div class="quote_body">Sad to say.. i WAS a person who thinks like Simone Dean last time... but that was last time..<br><br>but i actually got to see the real world out there and i got to understand why some ppl are less unfortunate.<br><br>yes, people are sometimes rich because they work hard for it. but some poor who want to be rich simply do not have to opportunity given to them. can't afford  their own education, forced by circumstance to leave school early to support family.<br><br>the world out there is a myriad of different social classes, it is not just a simple, Low-income earners, Middle-class, higher-income.<br><br>They are people from rich family but are poor because parents kicked them out at 18 years old wanting them to earn their own keeps. Some 18 year olds rough it out, some simply gave up. But you can't blame them, some parents think all 18 year old are ready for this cruel world.<br><br>i may carry on... but pointless is one's adamant in their beliefs...<br><br>Simon...  you are entitled to what you think now. But maybe just maybe your thoughts may change in future, until then you might think back then of your thoughts now.</div></blockquote>Glad to see that you stopped having tunnel vision. While there are indeed people who are poor because of a simple lack of effort on their part, there are also many others who are poor because of the circumstances that have been presented to them.<br><br>I for one have seen too many people who are unable to get higher education because their parents are unable to afford it. There are indeed subsidies and financial aid, but even with those they're still unable to afford higher education - and a ticket out of the poverty trap.<br><br>Unfortunately, our good friend Simon Dean is simply too bigoted and too narrow-minded to accept this point of view. People like him and Salman have the mentality that everything they think is right and that the viewpoints of others are all wrong.<br><br>Simon, the world doesn't revolve around me, and it doesn't revolve around you, either. If you're not willing to even consider the points of view of others then please leave. This is a DISCUSSION forum, not a forum for you to proclaim that your views are always right.<br><br>And watch the use of the brush and tar please. I know that there are poor people who misuse the help given to them and refuse to put in a day of honest work. However, it would also do you a lot of good to remember that just because there's one bad apple doesn't mean that all the apples in the barrel are bad. If you're going to tar ALL poor people with the same brush, then I pity you. Wait till you're on the receiving end of one such tarring.</div>
