            <div class='col-md body'>Hallo.....aktually the thinking that the poor should not be bothered with, and is a waste of money to help them, is not uncommon.<br><br>However you should firstly remember why you pay tax. You pay tax to the government, which represent the society, so you pay tax to the society.<br><br>In other words, you pay tax for the embetterment of society, or put in other words you pay tax to embetter other people, as well as yourself in the process, for everyone.<br><br>It might be difficult to imagine how you can benefit and embetter yourself by spending your money for the poor, compared to spending on roads or buildings, for example.<br><br>The answer is externality, every disadvantaged person is actually harming you. By helping them actually you are helping yourself by letting them illuminate more positive externality, thus embettering the society which you yourself also live in, and therefore gain from. This is essentially not much different from spending on roads or buildings.<br><br>If you worry about them spending on vices/ luxury, etc, keep in mind that many governments including Singapore is very careful not to encourage welfarism, Singapore has pretty tight policy with measures in place, for instance the handout amount is just minimum to get by, and where possible it includes other help such as job training, etc.<br><br>So now you should keep these in mind, and come at peace with yourself.</div>
