Absolutely useless unless you apply for civil service.<br><br>Personally must mature fast --- once come out to work, must exhibit professionalism.

Experienced Singaporeans compete with fresh uni graduates, fresh uni graduates compete with diploma graduates---KNN.

            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes employer put up ads to test market. Sometimes, internal referal already get person but do for the sake of doing so they give you sh.it.<br>Othertimes, you got to pick up cues and use it to recognise the kind of interview process and person you will get to work with in the organisation.<br><br>Be glad that sometimes you do not get the job with these screw up interviewers. It tells something about the company. Usually its a bad sign when the interviewer screws interviewee, it means they do not treat people well. They are not aware that weather customer or employee, we spread the word around for bad companies.<br><br></div>
