The working world is so competitive that one need to hit the ground running... I say this becos I had started first day of work in taxis and plane before.  This is esp true for MNC as the stakes/demand are high.  So if they are to employ a "freshie" they will think twice about what are the training to provide, where is ur value.<br><br>At the end of the day, u must show tat ur value contributed will be greater than what they pay (training, salary, benefits, intangibles)</div>
