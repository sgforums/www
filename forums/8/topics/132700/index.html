            <div class='col-md body'>I know misa's line is very busy, in fact you have to visit their office to find out, so I won't really fault them if they don't give prompt service. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  In fact, I don't even expect prompt service especially from travel operators.  Anyway, tip of advice from me, if you want a reply from misa, drop them an email, but don't expect it to be prompt either. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

I think they're usually pretty busy, sometimes lax with returning calls but on the whole their service is ok. Travel agents are one of the worst people to deal with and I'd put real estate agents alongside them.<br><br>I remember a travel agency located around the Golden Landmark area - I provided their agent with our travel itinerary, was given ticket quotations, sent her a fax for confirmation and was asked to go down to make a downpayment for the reservations. Throughout the entire process I negotiated with one person. Suddenly the person "disappeared". I called for days, couldn't get the lady and when I finally lost my patience I was told there was no such person there. Right.  I won't go on about how I felt then.<br><br>One thing I learnt from that experience - the agencies that procrastinate and try not to give you black &amp; white details/prices/confirmations, drop them like a sack of potatoes esp if you have less than flexible travel dates.</div>
