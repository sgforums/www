Wishing things around to change to the better. Hoping for new surprises to appear suddenly that will brighten your life up, that will break through the routinal life that appear in your everyday.<br><br>Going on holiday made you seen different things that amuse you, you hope to see these in your own homeland. combining every great stuff you seen everywhere together.
