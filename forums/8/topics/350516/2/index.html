              <p>Sure, some of his pieces do have messages. But they're kind of... out ofcontext, aren't they? What's the difference between him painting his graffiti on a wall, versus painting it on a canvas and having it hung on a wall then? That to me (i.e. this is personal opinion) is why his work isn't as strong AS GRAFFITI because his subject matter, themes, etc, are not differentiated from regular 'gallery' work. Instead of utilizing his environment to its fullest, as I was saying, all he is doing is taking gallery subject matter and putting them on outdoor surfaces with spray cans. He does not react to a billboard that is already there, or the crumbling of paint. One of the reasons Banksy is so highly regarded (not just by me) is because he takes what is existing, what is decaying, and turns it into a work of art. He reacts to things in the environment, and uses them to state his messages.</p>
              <p>If I'd looked at Slacsatu's 'message' pieces, I wouldn't know they were trying to express a message until I'd read his comment about it. That's not how a 'message' should function, should it?</p>
              <p>Then again, there's different ways to define 'graffiti', and obviously these different ways are being expressed right here in this thread :) If you think a piece is graffiti just because it's done with aerosols and sprays, then more power to you, I'm not going to contest that (art philosophy is convoluted as is already) -- I, and I mean just me, so don't take it that I'm generalizing for everybody -- personally think that graffiti is defined not by how illegal it is (although that helps), but by how it utilizes foreign surfaces.</p>
              <p>I am by no means saying that Slacsatu is not worthy of the respect he has gained. It does take a lot of skill to paint like that. But a lot of his stuff is very 'clean' and doesn't 'get to me' the way Banksy's images do. I'm allowed to prefer another artist over Slacsatu, right? ;)</p>
              <p>EDIT: Oh, after looking at the Afghan girl image, I realized it's actually quite derivative of Steve McCurry's famous photograph:</p>
              <p><img src="https://nl.savetibet.org/images/calendar/SteveMcCurryAfghanGirl.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="800"></p>
              <p>What do you say to that? I say it takes a lot less talent to just copy from a photograph that made someone else famous than to come up with original content.</p>
              <p>Is this 'real' SG graffiti, then, where our artists have to plagiarize from other people's work?</p>

              <p>Yes, you do have good valid points there. Everyone are entitled to his/her opinion and i respect that. Somehow i do feel that his "regular 'gallery' work" are his motive to make Graffiti known over here or acceptable to some because i rarely sees them. Maybe as an Artist (by no means i am offending you), you cant really sense the "strong" messages that the writer have put in due to different perspectives. From what i have gathered,( i hung out alot with the underground sub-culture people) some of them didnt regard themselves as an Artist and felt that messages  are not that necessary in their pieces. Most of them told me it is more of a lifestyle and it is just a need to express themselves while enjoying it. Moreover, we are unfortunate to see "real Graffiti" in Singapore are not that much alive due to the strict laws. Hence, the limitation of utilizing foreign surfaces but i suppose that is how the culture have been nurtured by the practioneers here.</p>
              <p>But like i said before, Graffiti writings are really hard to comprehend due to the fact that it didnt involve(mostly) the use of image or unless it is accompanied by a theme unlike stencil which is more direct and people can relate to. But if a person is to be "higly-regarded" by the community for doing Graffiti, will it not defeat the purpose? While Graffiti is suppose to be subversive in nature, Banksy have somehow manage to 'clean' that image. Did it not dettered the real meaning of Graffiti even tho' how well he hides from them. He could jolly well introduce himself (since public appreciate him so much) to the public and still continues to do what he likes (without much restriction that is). But i doubt very so and dont get me wrong, i dont hate on him nor do i have the intention to compare "who's good or who's not". He surely have pieces that got people to think. But maybe my taste is more on the Graffiti writing side.</p>
              <p>About that Afghan girl image, i know that it is from a famous photographer but what i'm trying to imply is that Slacsatu are not ignorant (to me at least in terms of spreading messages) about the issues around the globe unlike some youth who spent their "good life" and didnt bother to know what is happening around them. I believe he didnt have the intention to copy it but rather to portray it as a message by using Graffiti as a platform.</p>
              <p>In this new-modern-world, who dares to say that they have an original work? Everyone can be an artist and are inspired by each other making it harder to spot the genuine.</p>
              <p>Lastly, i do believe that you and i have little knowledge about these guys. Who really have an accuracy over them?Let us just stick with our preferences. Peace~</p>

              <p>do take note that even stencil artists will take a picture reference from sumwer to threshold,cut and sprayed on.messages?in singapore?haha there's no freedom of speech here as far as i can see. all graffiti artists names like me and especially slacsatu are on the authorities list for future references aka interrogation.do u know that?i dont think so.subjective themes will just put our heads on the chopping blocks,hence the banned on the freedom to express on the walls at somerset.there's a story behind that.</p>
              <p>other than that, i believe slacsatu can do more than just mere 'fake' graffiti like u said haha.he's just too dedicated to it thats all.further more he had lots to proof to the international scene coz thats what it is all about right now.getting paid for jobs. to me this is as important too coz not all ppl will give them their supports if anitin goes wrong say they do it illegaly.maybe u like to see them on the streets here, but hundreds more don't.all the more reason why graffiti artists here need to be more versatile. slacsatu is just too underestimated here but not to the world.peace!</p>

              <p>Yeah I'm aware that a lot of graffiti artists do take references from somewhere else, but there is a fine line between taking reference and manipulating it, versus straight out copying. I love some of his other works though, just not that one.</p>
              <p>And okay, I think you guys are getting way too defensive, lol. Art is to be critiqued! If you can't stand art being critiqued and questioned maybe you should question putting it out there in the first place; furthermore if we never questioned things about our art and the people who make them we would not have any progress. Don't take this the wrong way man, if all an artist ever got throughout his career was "omg that's nice" he would never improve.</p>
              <p>I do understand a lot of limitations are due to the restricted nature of Singapore's environment. To that end any graffiti in Singapore is a step forward in my eyes, and I didn't say Slacsatu's art was 'fake', I said it lacked the spirit and ideals of other graffiti artists but that's not through any fault of his, just a circumstance of, like you said, being on the interrogation lists, and it being a different type of graffiti. I <em>wish</em> we had the avenues in Singapore to express more on our walls, but we don't, so that's that. We don't even have crumbling paint for graffiti artists to modify, yeah? lol.</p>
              <p>You wanted to see some of my artwork, sure. Perhaps you could post some of yours as well, we can make this an art sharing session.</p>
