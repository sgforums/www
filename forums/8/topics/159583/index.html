They are color coded, so it's quite simple to understand after a while.<br><br>Anyway Odaiba is more of an architectural exposition. Plenty of nice buildings but the shopping cannot be compared against that of Harajuku and Shibuya. That's the teen capital, not so much of shinjuku htough it's really just farther down the road. Shinjuku is generally considered the main commercial district, somewhat similar to our orchard road. then you have the seriously high end and expensive ginza, where you can find pretty much any brands which costs and arm and a leg.<br><br>Still if apple has the chance it might be quite worth it to take the monorail across rainbow bridge into odaiba. just don't get off. once you hit the expo centre, the monorail will turn back, and then you can get off at one station before and pay a lot less fare.<br><br>If apple intends to go to hokkaido be sure to include the train fare there; i'm not sure how much it costs but it's easily sgd$100? coz' that's what the *bus* fare to kyoto costs. considering that hokkaio is much farther away, the train fare would probably be around sgd$200...<br><br>Anyway who on earth wants to go to hokkaido? beo cows? nothing there...</div>
