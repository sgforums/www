Hostels tend to be crowded with very shady characters.<br><br>But that's ok, coz' I'm also damn shady. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Some americans even offered me pot which they brought in from vietnam! + I guy = nothing to lose.<br><br>The owner of the hostel which I was staying in Roppongi (Tokyo Guest House) was some seriously HUUUGE black guy. But it's ok once the ice breaks; he's friendlier then most people that I know of.<br><br>I was able to stay in Tokyo for quite some time; largely because it backpackers hostel was very cheap (and he offered me a discount from day 7 onwards) and i was able to visit pretty much all the oddities in Japan. Such as love hotels, capsule hotels, bath houses etc etc. Beer vending machines, which japan is famous for, isn't even common around the metropolitan area; i had to go to somewhere near their uh... school where all the olympic atheletes train just to spot one.<br><br>Though of course if one was a touristy kindda person they'd die of boredom by day 5 or something...</div>

'black death' (rough translation) concerts. I went for one in uh, shinjuku i think (can't remember); quite a few guys dress up like metallica with face paint and all, then the girls are those classic lolita gals. The crowd's appearance can get quite scary, but ultimately they all seem harmless enough.<br><br>Must go places so that you can tell your mom/dad you were really in tokyo<br><br>Shinjuku + harajuku + shibuya =&gt; Shinjuku 2nd district (nii-chome, or kabuki-cho) is where you'll find all the love hotels. If you're looking for sleaze it's uh... in kabuki cho as well, but in a different part. It's your archtype of jap porn.<br><br>tokyo imperial palace =&gt; just go wander around the entrance, and hope to get a glimpse of princess masako. Oh ya, you'll also see familiar stuff like OCBC around this area as well...<br><br>odaiba =&gt; the island is so small, you can walk it in 4 hours. Can consider Fuji TV HQ, Toyota Building, + expo (but you probably can't enter)<br><br>ueno park=&gt; can consider going to todai for a visit; setting for love hina. nothing much here but plenty of parks and museum. nearby ueno park are plenty of those pacinko parlours.<br><br>roppongi hills =&gt; where all the stars stay, but really an overhyped place<br><br>Ginza =&gt; as its name suggests, where all the glitz is. you probably won't end up buying anything here. SONY hq is found here.<br><br>there places pretty much define metropolitan tokyo.<br><br>EDIT: Oh yes, the main building for japanese fashion is found in shibuya 101 building. It's pretty much almost an exclusively female shopping centre; if you wanna get those kick-ass boots + shorts + pink furry top + beret + long gloves japs always wear this is where you wanna be.<br>So many chiobus here........... nearly died of nosebleed.<br><br>Edit2: Sorry, missed out Asakusa, where the famous asakusa temple is.<br>and akihabara, where all the otakus and electronics are.<br></div>
