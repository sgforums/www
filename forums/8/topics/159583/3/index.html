Hence the typical stereotype of 'zen' in japan. The Meiji Shrine (dedicated to the emperor Meiji) in Harajuku is an example of it, though again it's a little weak.<br><br>Can't think of any typical shrines offhand around tokyo, except the temple dedicated to Tokugawa Ieyasu, which combines both the landscape of a japanese palace and architecture of temple, found in Nikko. But that's around an hour or 2 train ride away.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You have come to the right place with the right question at the right time! I myself have been to the three places (Tokyo, Harajuku, Hokkaido) you want to ask about. I went last year at December 2004. Spent a week there. I paid SGD$2230 for the tour package, and brought along about SGD$500 for the trip. I did not spend much, as my uncle was the person who spent money on the skiing and snow mobile in Hokkaido. Here is my trip report...<br><br>Day 1: Took NH902 from Singapore to Tokyo, Narita Airport. All Nippon Airways rocks! Watched three movies and aircraft was already going to land. The private TV screen on the back of every chair screened real nice movies.....watched Cinderella Story, I Robot and Dodgeball. Flight time is from 2355hrs to 0725hrs<br><br>Day 2: Reached Narita Airport at 0725hrs feeling extremely deprived of sleep....watched movies for 6 hrs on end.....japanese tour guide met us at the arrivals and brought us to the bus...another surprise, the bus was brand new, rolled out of the factory just a week ago....lolz...so lucky. Bus brought us to Tokyo city centre....saw some imperial park....lolz...boring but nice and cool. Temperature at Tokyo was 12-15 degrees celsius. Later went to Ginza for shopping......Ginza is a high class shopping district... Went for lunch, then bus brought us to Haneda Airport, also in Tokyo, to take a plane to Hokkaido. Plane was NH861, also ANA, in fact all my flights were ANA. Flight took 1hr30mins. Reached Hakodate Airport, the southern most point of Hokkaido. Another bus took us to Trappistine Convent, some nunnery....later went up to Mt. Hakodate by a big gondola. After that went for dinner then back to hotel. We stayed at Hotel Hakodate Royal.<br><br>Day 3: Had a great night's sleep and woke up for breakfast at the hotel cafe. After that the bus took us to the Goryokaku Park to look around, then to the famous Hakodate Morning Market. So many crabs and lobsters and seafood there....bought a fresh scallop and ate it on the spot....sweet and delicious, yum. After that went for lunch then took the bus to Lake Toya, which is 2hrs away. One thing, in Hokkaido, the sky starts to darken at about 3.30pm local time and thats about 2.30pm singapore time. At about 3.30pm Singapore time the sky wud be totally dark in Hokkaido! Thats only in winter though.  Anyway, back to my bus ride to Lake Toya....Reached Toya and went to visit to Mt Showa volcano.....After that went to bear ranch to see bears....hmmm.....nothing much....went to hotel for tatami style dinner then slept in the nice tatami hotel room. Hotel also had hot spring facilities, enjoyed it alot The name of the hotel is Toya Kanko Hotel.<br><br>Day 4: Had breakfast at hotel then took the bus to Jigokudani/Hell Valley to see another Volcano....then went to Shiraoi Ainu Village.....had lunch...took bus to Sapporo. Took 2hrs to reach Sapporo. Shopped around, visit beer factory and went to play snow mobile....went up the snowy hill, temperature about -20 degrees. Came back down to the bus my legs and hands cannot feel liao...lolz. Had dinner then went back hotel.......APA Hotel and Resort (Sapporo).<br><br>Day 5: Had breakfast at hotel again, then visit white chocolate factory.....drove to Otaru, about 20 mins.....Otaru is so nice, whole town is like a music town......had lunch....went music box shop....then went back Sapporo and visited Odori Park, Tokeidai Clock Tower.....had dinner, then went to Chitose about 40mins then stayed at Hotel Nikko Chitose. Had chinese style dinner in hotel......<br><br>Day 6: Had breakfast in hotel again, then went by bus to Sapporo-Chitose Airport to take plane back to Tokyo. Flight NH56 took 1hrs 30mins to reach Tokyo's Haneda Airport. In Tokyo, visited Tokyo tower then went to the punk shopping area Harajuku, visited Odaiba Park, saw Venus Fort......had dinner, then went back hotel to sleep....Hotel Metropolitian Tokyo...<br><br>Day 7: Had breakfast at hotel, then went shopping at the Tobu and Seibu shopping centres nearby. Later took bus to Narita Airport. Flight NH901 flew from Narita at 1625hrs and reached Singapore at 2250hrs. Had a great holiday!<br><br>By the way, the snow mobile costs a BOMB. For two persons, one driver and one passenger, be prepared to pay 15000yen, which is about SGD$230! And as for the food there, I only paid for one meal at Tokyo. A bowl of ramen can cost 900 to 1000 yen, about SGD$15-16. The holiday I had was out of this world, but be prepared to spend SGD$10000 and above for a family of four.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>By the way, when I went to Japan last year, the exchange rate was expensive, SGD$1.58 to 100Yen. Now, currently, the rate has gone so much cheaper, at SGD$1.42 to 100Yen. I am planning to go for a 5-6 Day break at Tokyo during the March Holidays. Will be visitng places like Tokyo Disneyland and Mount Fuji.</div>
