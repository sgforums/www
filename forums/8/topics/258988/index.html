            <div class='col-md body'>anybody went backpacking in australia before?<br><br>I am intending to go. Ya know, 3 yrs ago, i saw this newspaper article about this sporean guy who was a leading salesman in his company. But one day, his mentor dies in the silkair crash in 1997.<br><br>At his mentor memorial service, he thought to himself "what would I regret the most if I was to die tomorrow?"<br><br>That thought set him on a globe-trotting experience. He spent the next 4 years backpacking the world. He gained alot of new experience, made a whole lot of friends which includes a group of drug-dealers in moroccan who accosted him but let him go after they found out he was only a backpacker from singapore.<br><br>Yea, I mean, the world is so big right? If I was really to go tomorrow, I would really regret not seeing the world. So I have told myself I would go on a backpacking solo trip to australia at year end but I need to get some advice and other related stuffs. Who? Who have been backpacking b4? I guess it's a really good way to discover yourself.<br><br>I had a friend who backpacked from korea all the way to china. He stayed at farmer's huts, slept in the forest. But he almost got killed by a brown bear during his trip. Close shave.<br><br>Anybody pls?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For Australia, i've only done one place, Adelaide.<br><br>You dont really need to worry about backpacking, the only places which i feel are a little bit more "unsafe" are the rural areas of china, like He Bei. "Unsafe" as in, theft. No need worry about other things.<br><br>For accomodation, food and other things, it depends on ur budget, from my exp in Adel, spent a month there and costs about 1.2 to 1.4k. Per night in a decent traveller's hut would be around 25 Australian dollars to around 35, depending on the area i guess..<br><br>Delicacy is a big bad point, it will make u spend alot more. Eating at fast food restaurants would be better, but most of the times, we just eat bread.<br><br>Although u will be travelling alone there, chances are, you wont be backpacking alone. Might make friends while in the hut, and travel together, good choice as somebody can look after u..<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yea,  I heard the pickpockets there are legendary. One sec, that's all it takes for ur wallet to be gone.<br><br>Australia is so big, and I have difficulty deciding where to start and where to end exactly. I wouldn't wanna be caught dead in the Great victoria desert without an ounce of water.<br><br>Do have to pack alot of things right? Actually was settling for Europe, cos there eurail there travels through 18 countries, all one needs is a railway pass of about $1000 for unlimited travel for 1 month. cos i guess winter backpacking in europe is extremely undesirable.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I backpacked Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne for close to a month last December. Visited the outskirts and Gold Coast too. Spent most of the time, say 2 close to 2 weeks in Melbourne.<br><br>Food is generally expensive, a plate of fried rice in a food court in Chinatown, Melbourne is easily 8 dollars. Transport is expensive too, from crown casino to my residence at Box Hill in a cab for 15 - 20 mins costed me 60 AUD. (Those electric trams are a better idea, or if you got a Singapore driving license - Rent a car then. Their driving culture is almost similar as Singapore.. the traffic's better too)<br><br>I'd recommend going to Philip Island for the magnificient view and to see lotsa penguins. Weather is pretty cold, it was summer when I visited but still cold and bitter especially at night. Melbourne is slightly colder than Brisbane and Sydney.<br><br>It was a wonderful experience, save for some unpleasant incident - Chinese bashing is common especially in Gold Coast and Sydney. But people are generally very nice and warm.<br><br>Remember to pay the shopping malls and surf shops a visit, their surf products although almost the same price as Singapore, they got a larger variety of designs you can't find in SG. Even I, an anti-surf wear guy... Got tempted and bought afew surf shorts and even ripcurl jacket <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>It's a grand idea to explore the wild life parks, theme parks and other attractions. But don't forget to shop! You will find a lot of nice things there.<br><br>For Hotels, just go to some 3 star hotels - they're fine enough, unless you're on a huge budget. I can't remember the names of the hotels I stayed in; I'm quite a frequent traveler. When I was in Melbourne though, I spent the last week renting a holiday bungalow in Box hill, costed me close to 300 a day. But it was worth every cent.<br><br>'Nuff said, just go and feel the Aussie experience. While, I get ready to wander Hawaii this September <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am not really sure about europe, haven been to there yet. For a start, u can go to China? or New zealand. New zealand is my favourite, top of the list.<br><br>No need pack lots of clothes. My first i pack like 8 sets, and i regret. Bring 2 or 3 sets, you can wash them at traveller's hut.<br><br>I usually go for budget travels, i am still student, budget low.. which means travelling mostly are done by walking, the public transport, or minibuses which sometimes are avaliable at traveller's hut.<br><br>I recommend u to New zealand first. Oamaru one of the best, or u can go climb the legendary LOTR's mount Doom, its magnificant.<br><br>Here are ome pictures of Australia, Oamaru and climbing of Mount Doom for ur references, really nice really must go. MT doom must go by mini buses.... thats what the bus driver said.<br><br><img src="http://img.villagephotos.com/p/2006-12/1231771/lakepukaki.jpg"><br><img src="http://img.villagephotos.com/p/2006-12/1231771/Akaroa.jpg"><br><img src="http://img.villagephotos.com/p/2006-12/1231771/Dunedin.jpg"><br><img src="http://img.villagephotos.com/p/2006-12/1231771/LakeTekapu.jpg"><br><img src="http://img.villagephotos.com/p/2006-12/1231771/Oamaru.jpg"><br><img src="http://img.villagephotos.com/p/2006-12/1231771/LakeTekpu.jpg"><br><img src="http://img.villagephotos.com/p/2006-12/1231771/LOTR.jpg"><br><img src="http://img.villagephotos.com/p/2006-12/1231771/MountCook.jpg"><br></div>
