            <div class='col-md body'>Wat if one day when we die we can transfer our thoughts to the net and it becomes an AI(artificial intelligence) on the net. So it is a way of prolonging our lives and as u r an AI on the net u too would have to work in the net to get money to buy latest antivirus software to protect urself against virus. And of cos there could be a whole lot of possibilities too as to like there will be like travelling from a US server to a local server and u will experience a whole different world. And u too would be able to keep in contact with ur future generations as they can contact u thru the net. ppl can find out more of the past from the past(which r the AI). So it's like a whole different viewpoint can be taken from all generations of time and not juz  like now the viewpoint is only from a certain generation in the present time. And wif AI, Problems would be able to solve easier and faster as the AI(or U) could think way much faster than u could now and the storage file(brain size) is almost unlimited. Juz imagine U could come up with an ans of 985645724*4568514556 in less than a sec without the need of a calculator. And u too could interact wif both ppl and the AI round U.So example u(AI) stumble upon a channel or forum and u chat wif them and they ask u where ur from and wat u do and things like that.And imagine replying I'm an AI of who and I'm dead for 1000 yrs now. So I'm actually 1079 yrs old....something like that.<br><br>BUT is it actually a good idea for that to happen?? Would ppl tend to die earlier juz to transfer their AI to the net and lead a very carefree life?? Would humans be very dependant on AI's to a extent that AI starts to control them??<br><br>So wat would it be?? It actually comes to a point in our life that we should decide if we need to actually go on improving our technology which may in turn destroy ourselves one day or juz stop now but ending up making life's miserable for ourselves as we do not have the technology for the easy way out???<br><br>------------------<br>~Nobody ever taught me how to learn~<br>~They all juz stand round and watch you burn~</div>

But look at the author Verne, Jules (1828-1905), he wrote a book Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea and it's juz simply bout a machine that can submerge into the sea...and ppl then were like wow that's impossible...how could ppl breathe and things like that...but yrs later when submarines are such a common thing in our lifes that ppl starts to think that the impossible does happen.<br><br>So watever that may seem too sci-fi or too impossible may juz happen one day.<br><br>And anyway I think it's quite possible that the T2 issue could happen but I think mine is juz bout an AI living on the net and as it gets way too advanced and when ppl starts to depend on them a lot, they could juz well take over our lives as they have access to ur money, ur property and everything as everything are now computerised and things like that.

From the present state you could see that humans are getting more and more intelligent as in a sense that now a mininum requiement for our youngster is a diploma cert, this to show that maybe in another 30-40 yrs there would be no more road sweepers, taxi drivers, bus drivers, garbage collectors. By then everything would be computerised, computer this computer that.  So why not that one day the computer really take over the world and human are consider EXTINCT.  The dinosuars were also extinct and nobody knows why.  I guess this is how we will meet our ends, which I guess that we have foreseen it before it happens, but which I think no one would be able to do anything about it...coz it just bring too more advantage more then any disadvantages it have....alot of examples are already in our real life situation, PDAs, handphones, computers etc...so I think the pinnacle of humans are the rapid advancement of technology and one day we will be dominated by them...where there will be no return....heheh....this are just my guesses...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Nothing can't be done, unless you don't want to</div>
