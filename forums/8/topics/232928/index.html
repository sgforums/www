            <div class='col-md body'>He met her on a party. She was so outstanding, all<br>guys chasing after her, while he so normal, nobody<br>paid attention to him. At the end of the party, he<br>invited her to have coffee with him, she<br>as surprised, but due to being polite, she<br>promised. They sat in a nice coffee shop, he was<br>too nervous to say anything, she felt<br>uncomfortable, she thought, please, let me go<br>home.... suddenly he asked the waiter. "would you<br>please give me some salt? I'd like to put it in my<br>coffee."<br><br>Everybody stared at him, so strange! His face<br>turned red, but still, he put the salt in his coffee<br>and drank it. She asked him curiously; why you<br>have this hobby? He replied: "when I was a little<br>boy, I was living near the sea, I like playing in the<br>sea, I could feel the taste of the sea, just like the<br>taste of the salty coffee. Now every time I have the<br>salty coffee, I always think of my childhood, think<br>of my hometown, I miss my hometown so much, I<br>miss my parents who are still living there".<br>While saying that tears filled his eyes. She was<br>deeply touched.<br><br>That's his true feeling, from the bottom of his heart.<br>A man who can tell out his homesickness, he<br>must be a man who loves home, cares about home,<br>has responsibility of home. Then she also started<br>to speak, spoke about her faraway hometown, her<br>childhood, her family. That was a really nice<br>talk, also a beautiful beginning of their story.<br><br>They continued to date. She found that actually he<br>was a man who meets all her demands; he had<br>tolerance, was kind hearted, warm, careful. He was<br>such a good person but she almost missed him!<br>Thanks to his salty coffee!<br><br>Then the story was just like every beautiful love<br>story , the princess married to the prince, then<br>they were living the happy life... And, every<br>time she made coffee for him, she put some salt in<br>the coffee, as she knew that's the way he liked it.<br><br>After 40 years, he passed away, left her a letter<br>which said: "My dearest, please forgive me, forgive<br>my whole life lie. This was the only lie I said to you-<br>--the salty coffee. Remember the first time we<br>dated? I was so nervous at that time, actually I<br>wanted some sugar, but I said salt. It was hard for<br>me to change so I just went ahead.I never thought<br>that could be the start of our communication! I tried<br>to tell you the truth many times in my life, but I<br>was too afraid to do that, as I have promised not to<br>lie to you for anything..<br><br>Now I'm dying, I afraid of nothing so I tell you the<br>truth: I don't like the salty coffee, what a strange<br>bad taste.. But I have had the salty coffee for my<br>whole life! Since I knew you, I never feel sorry for<br>anything I do for you. Having you with me is my<br>biggest happiness for my whole life. If I can live for<br>the second time, still want to know you and have<br>you for my whole life,even though I have to drink<br>the salty coffee again".<br><br>Her tears made the letter totally wet.Someday,<br>someone asked her: what's the taste of salty<br>coffee?<br><br>It's sweet. She replied.</div>
