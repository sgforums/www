            <div class='col-md body'>Hehehe ... for me, I am very bochup to be honest, I cant be bothered with the contact lenses. I wear glasses and dont comb my hair and i go around without make up and I couldnt care less about how I look (well, unless there's a cute guy i want to impress hahaha)<br><br>But most of the times when I play sports, its so troublesome to push up the glasses, and its so hard to see the corners and sides.

            <div class='col-md body'>well yeah it can suck. specs took my peripheral vision away. need it for my sport so i started on contacts last june. well its better now but sometimes can still be irritating when your eyes dry out. or when u go clubbing and all the Shit sticks to your contacts. overall, i guess i'm not to concerned about it, because i can still do what i want and what i love.</div>
