(becos tt's when some true colours will show...)...i read in one of the past issues of Her World tt some couples...after goin thru the cohabiting period...decided tt they are not suitable for each other...due to some "bad habits" and peeves they cannot stand...so i think in thise sense...cohabiting is certainly acceptable...perhaps thru cohabiting...u can relli know wat your partner is like...and from there decide whether he/she IS THE ONE u are going to live the rest of life with...otherwise...it may be 2 late to realise after the marriage...then gotta divorce or wat...more troublesome...<br><br>i stress again that...it is acceptable but not encourageable to cohabit...and only if u are seriously considering abt a marriage...<br><br>just my humble opinion  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Sparkle :<br><br>Basically, I have nothing against cohabitation because I think I will prefer that to marriage. It is unfortunate that in the modern days, marriage is no longer considered to be a sacred union of 2 people. In truth, and if I specialize my example to modern day Singapore, you will find marriage has reduced to nothing but a piece of social contract where the marriage has other connotations, such as the flat, the wedding dinner, income (the 5Cs) and other things. I have friends who get married young and surprisingly and unfortunately, one-two couples has ended in a divorce, and their reason is basically that they are not compatible, after like 7 years of r/s , transiting from courtship to marriage. People of a younger age, in my opinion are not very responsible as compared to the past.<br><br>The whole appealing thing about cohabitation is that people can do away with their responsibility because at any time, they can decide not  to live together and go seperate ways. There are no strings attached because there is no legal binding. In my opinion, cohabitation is pretty unfair for a gal, because she suffers more social prejuidice in our culture compare to a guy. The worst consequence is that when she gets pregnant. I was told by a lawyer once that there is a law in the Singapore constitution that states that a child with unmarried parents is not entitled to free education. That is why the Community Chest takes care of these children, by looking sponsors to their education. I think that a lot of cohabiting couples will go to marriage when they have a kid.<br><br>During a coffee break, I was asking a British friend about their views on cohabitation. She told me that in British law, there is a status called common-law husband and wife. In this special status, the couple is a cohabiting and share certain legal rights as a married couple. This is very common in Britain these days. Unfortunately I cannot go into specifics for I am no lawyer. It seems to me a good alternative to marriage.<br><br>The basis of a marriage for a person is to ask the question whether he/she can live a lifetime with another person. Although I am against feudalistic chinese values that we have arranged marriages, yet they last longer than what we have today. I recalled my grandfather once told me that he only loved my grandmother after going through the horrors of World War II, and it is difficult for him to accept an arranged marriage in his time.<br><br>Actually, I prefer cohabitation even though I am one of those people who still believed in the sacred nature of a marriage. I have said my peace.. So, what do the others think?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm...cannot get to sleep...might as well put my mind to better use rather than counting sheeps...<br><br>Honestly speaking, I am not for cohabitation, even though I admit that we guys are probably the ones who "benefit" from it in the event the cohabitation period reveals that prolonged relationship together is not feasible.<br><br>Like prodigal, I do acknowledge that marriage is indeed a sacred vow undertaken by two perons to live their lives together. But cohabitating is like taking a "sample" or a "prelude" to that vow and does not seem correct (well, at least people like me who are skeptics of cohabitation).<br><br>Yes I agree that Cohabitation can allow one to try out living with your chosen partner before committing to marriage. But if you require this stage in your relationship, it shows two things:<br><br>1) You obviously do not know your partner well enough.<br>2) You are definately not ready for marriage and all the responsibilities that come with it.<br><br>In this respect I feel cohabitation is pretty lame and unecessary. I don't think you'll see many couple who had been together for about 5 years cohabitating before their marriage. Seriously, the objective behind dating is not just to have fun, but to really understand your partner.<br><br>I also accept that this option is becoming more attractive and feasible in an age where relationships can be made and broken in the twinkling of an eye. I think its sad to see relationships handled with such nonchalance by both parties. It certainly puts a big question mark on what is True Love these days. Perhaps it is just the way society in general is evolving. I do not really see any merit in this, but then again, who am I to say?<br><br>Anyway, the above views were expressed by a person who has never been in a relationship nor cohabitated. Feel free to point out any glaring errors or mis-informed opinions.<br><br>Sincerely hope you people will have an easier time getting to sleep than me.<br><br>------------------<br>I do not embrace my dark side, but I do acknowledge it;<br>else I can never be whole</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To me there is nothing wrong with cohabitation. It is just two people(maybe more?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> ) living together under the same roof, in the same bed?, having sex with each other(one another?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> )<br><br>You'll get to find out things about the other person you never knew about. If you find love, good for you. If not, then just enjoy the company, when you're sick and tired of it, pack up and leave, no strings attached.<br><br>Just my two cents worth.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Auspex (edited 23 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well . I'm all for it. why .. well basically .. I've seen lots of people who are really close and stuff as friends .. but when they stay together .. havoc man .. cannot get along .. put the ratio .. 9 out of 10 people who try and stay together .. and become housemates cannot get along with each other .. as in living habits. However being a couple is different .. but the principal still applies. You never know a person really well until you stay with him/her.<br><br>------------------<br>ZeroS</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Cohabitate? Hmmm... Here I go again. In present day society, may I know if there is anything that a couple in a relationship can't do but a married couple can? I seriously doubt there are much. Examples will be like applying for a HDB flat together, but you can just rent a apartment or something like that to make do. I look at a relationship as follows:<br><br><blockquote>The beginning of a relatioship,<br>is the beginning of a marriage.</blockquote>Looking at a relationship in this perspective, does it make a difference if you cohabitate or not? Well, of course you will have to view a relatioship in this direction, if you seriously want it to work out. Likewise, if the intention of marriage is not there, what is the point of having a relaitonship in the first place? The time and energy wasted in a relationship cannot be made up for, but of course if you are fooling around then that's another story all together.<br><br>Living together includes alot of reponsibilty, the sharing of the household expenses, the sharing if housework, tolerence of each other behaviour, of course there are it's perks. E.g. Ability to spent more time together, having fun together, the chance to understand your partner's unknown habits and character. e.t.c.<br><br>The stage, the relatioship is in also matters, if it is a new relationship, living together might mean lesser tolerance level, and higher chance of breaking up, but it allows you to know if you can accept someone like that right in thr beginning of the relatioship. If the relationship already has it's roots well in the ground, living together could means that it is a way to further strenghten it. But it could also meant that you find out more about your partner than you can handle, thus again causing a break up, though the likelyhood of it happenning is lower than a new relationship, it will certainly hurt more.<br><br>There is no absolute answer to this I suppose, it is more of a matter of need analysis, meaning in that point of the relatioship, is there a need to live together to allow the relationship to grow further, and also ask yourself this question.<br><br>Are you willing to put your relationship in this gamble?<br><br>------------------<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Just my $0.02 worth</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hai ya,<br><br>Cohabiting is nothing in a society like this, depends on how you look at it. Living under the same roof can reveal some ugly truths. Sometimes it may be quite benefiting.<br><br>Some people find it very hard as they are the type who wants to look beautiful to their other half all the time, so they get up early and make themselves pretty before they are seen.<br><br>Some are the bochup type, then their other half will get so agitated by their dirty laundry, dirty plates and bad personal hygiene.<br><br>Some even have rules like sleeping in different bedrooms, curfews and stuff like that.<br><br>People grow closer sometimes because of cohabiting as they can learn more about their partners. Like what they do first thing in the morning, how cute they are while sleeping.....<br><br>Personally, I guess I will turn people off if they cohabitate with me.<br><br>Buahahhahahahaha......<br><br>:p<br><br>------------------<br>*(^_^)*</div>
