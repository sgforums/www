The Internet is an easy outlet for them and this has resulted in all the negative comments.'<br><br>Apparently, U-nee was an easy target because of her showbiz history - she had started at age 15 as a sweet and innocent girl-next-door actress, but disappeared for two years to transform herself into a singing sex goddess.<br><br>'U-nee was the most attacked because it was so evident in her face that she had extensive surgery,' said Miss Han.<br><br>'As opposed to some artistes who would deny it, U-nee had been very honest and open about having had surgery.... but it backfired on her. Some bloggers were more harsh on her and they hurt her.'<br><br>U-nee's death has left the nation reeling in shock and cast the media spotlight on cyber violence against celebrities.<br><br>Despite many affected artistes speaking up against the hurtful remarks during media interviews in the past, netizens have continued the attacks.<br><br>Miss Han said: 'People are saddened and shocked that words can push somebody to such extreme measures, but unfortunately, it won't put an end (to the celebrity bashing).'<br><br>Still, help may be on its way.<br><br>An earlier Reuters report said the Korean government plans to introduce a Bill on real-name authentication that requires Net users to log in with their national identification numbers (like our IC number).<br><br>This is supposed to help the authorities track netizens and reduce anonymous Internet attacks.</div>
