You guys still don't know the purpose of this thread?<br><br>Obviously Mistyblue was one of those who got caught... He's just unhappy about it...<br><br>One day, if Mistyblue gets knocked down by a car when he was jaywalking, he will wish in heaven (maybe in hell) that he was caught and warned by a policeman...</div></blockquote>1. People who sit in bus stop also get killed by cars who ram into the bus stop (I know the poly girl who die. She's the daughter of the shopowner in my old place I stay in) .<br><br>2. People who walk on pavement also get killed because the car fly into their face<br><br>3. People also get killed by cars who disobey traffic rules and decide green man is also for them to ram down pedestrian using the crossing (I saw this myself, the bus ram into this woman and she died on the spot).<br><br>4. Cars can also suddenly fly and ram into MRT.<br><br>The roads are built for both drivers and pedestrians and both need to learn to share the use of the road.  Cars can kill. I have never seen a pedestrian kill a car. So if the pedestrian want to use the road or jay walk, it only take 2 seconds for the driver to slow down. It does not hurt anyone and everyone go about their business. Sg drivers always think their money big cause they pay road tax and other road users must give way to their status showing car or they will horn like mutterficker sky fall down or give hand signals or what like want to fight face.  This is the lack of civility from my fellow people I never have to put up in other countries, even in China.<br><br>But if the police come and tell me that in order to "take care of my safety" he needs to fine me, instead of telling LTA to find a solution to the conditions of Jalan Eunos. Then I say he is a drone of the system. And you are condoning that being a drone is right. I do not need a TP to teach me safety. I have eaten more salt than that stupid TP. Plus I had work for the home team before. Its not as if people are stupid that we need more Nannying to tell us what is right or wrong.  This is down right annoying and presumptious that we are stupid. Isn't it elitism to think that we need to be taught that crossing the road in this manner is dangerous. Which 5 yr old kid do not know? If you feel you need a TP to book you to tell you that's for your safety and its dangerous to jaywalk, then by all means. Perhaps your IQ is just about there.<br><br>If TP feels jaywalking is dangerous, then should they not book everyone along Stamford Road near City Hall. Or Little India? From What I know, in order to prevent the indians walking on the roads, barriers were built. So this can be done. But it didn't solve the issue. The indians still walk on the roads but I am sure these indians would not pay the fines cause they do not f*** care. The TP can book until that have an ejaculation.  Why target Jalan Eunos?  Besides, there are a lot more drivers breaking all the rules in the rule book than pedestrian. Next time the TP will book us for walking outside of the 2 lines for the pedestrian crossing (This is a real case my friend personally experienced. Which I feel uncalled for.), so are they trying to treat us like stupid sheep and herd us around or they are so f* free - meaning we have been paying them salary and bonus to eat snake.<br><br>My safety is my personal concern. If I wish to die on the road or there is an accident due to my own mistake, then so be it. You DO not need to curse people to hell. I am sure you will go there first.<br><br></div>

Don't see the point at all. Apple and Oranges cannot be compared. Walking across the road don't necessarily mean certain death. It just ups the risk factor.<br><br>But the cases I stated are real. And it did happen. Go along the segment of the pedestrian walk along fort canning hill near to M. Sultan and you will see skid marks on the pavements, broken windows.  I am sure someone died there too case the roads are wash down every now and then.<br><br>And If people jay walk, you think they would be so stupid as to not watch out for cars? If you feel it necessary to be nannied to this extend that we have no freedom walking across the street (at my own risk) but not using the pedestrian crossing.<br><br>If people do not pay attention, they can die doing the most mundane things. Like my grandfather died chocking on a dumpling.  Anyone can potentially die from anything. So should Singapore ban dumplings and fishballs because they can KILL?<br><br></div>

And it's a good thing that you have done too.<br><br>Ranting at the Traffic Policeman will not achieve anything, simply because Traffic Police is in charge of traffic rules. They do not have anything to do with the lack of overhead bridges, poorly-planned roads, etc.<br><br>But it's heartening to know that you raised the issue with LTA.
