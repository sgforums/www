As non-smokers, we are vulnerable to passive smoke that comes out from cigarettes of those smokers. And scientifically proven, passive smoking is twice or three times more harmful than the cigarette smoke itself.<br><br>So.. i dun think it's right for smokers to just smoke on the spot. If want to smoke go somewhere secluded and smoke. don't affect others who don't smoke.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
