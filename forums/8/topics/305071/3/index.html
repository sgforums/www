Take a look at NYP's campaign, all u see is a paper clip. All the polys try to make their institution look like world class institutes through their campaign (ITE too, and i think they did a good job).<br><br>so there is nothing about coolness. If you think their campaigns still try to tell you the sole message that poly is cool, either you have a dead set sterotypical mindset, or the agencies have failed.<br><br>and poly or jc is all up to u. i saw my interest in one of the courses, so i joined.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i regretted choosing poly, if i were to have a choice i would go for jc education.<br><br>at 16 yrs old , we are expected to choose our career and course path, i think its too early to make such a decision.

From what i had experienced, in jc you would definitely have MORE frens, cause there arent much backstabbers there. I would not say completely no, but the number is really little.<br><br>But when u come to poly, omfg its totally different. If u have that slack mentality then all the best to u, u will still need to study one. In poly, the backstabbers that u meet will be plentiful. In front of u they might act frenly cause u are their so called 'classmate' , when u wanna look for them for help, they dont give a damn n try their best NOT to help u.<br><br>This is highly due to poly mates wanting to snatch <strong>the freaking 5% slot for uni</strong>, if i were u i would go JC and WORK my ASS off. BUT not forgetting my social life in jc, have fun make lots of frens and then enjoy yr 2 yrs in jc and at the same time get good grades go to uni. All the best =)</blockquote>I agree.. this is one of the major reasons for 'backstabbers'</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In reality, what the TS has said can only be counted towards empirical evidence which is at most a biased opinion about life in POLY. Unless the TS has gone through the JC route as well as the POLY route, TS statement cannot be used to compare with JC life within an acceptable degree of accuracy, and in the event that TS does go through in succession JC and POLY, TS too cannot make such comparisons applicable to a potential entrant due to the fact that experience gained after JC would have put TS in a more advantageous position in POLY and vice versa and all statements thereafter would have been usuitable to any potential entrant going either the POLY route or JC route and if by now you who is reading this feels confused by what I am saying then all I can say is that you are not ready for University.</div>

DUN last min during before exam period then start to find them (li shi pao fu jiao).<br><br>n one thing i encountered myself is some lecturers can be bias toward good students n impart them everything. tis is becos these students keen to learn comparing to students who r uninterested. so better let the lecturers know u r someone who r keen to learn n having good impression of u.<br><br>it is not ashame to ask stupid question too. cos u nvr know they can be useful for future sake.</div>
