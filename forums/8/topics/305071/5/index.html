Diploma=/=your career.<br><br>To stay on topic, I've been through both JC and Poly, albeit only for a short while. My social life was definitely better at poly, because of the myriad of activities and clubs that I joined. Studies was not a problem since I could prioritise and manage my time well. Halfway through I left for Australia and. There ends my contribution.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>JC poly or whatever, you will tend to meet different kind of mofos...<br><br>Regardless you like it or not, but lets look on the brighter side, you meet this kind of people you will have an experience on how to handle them when they try to cut you on the slack side on the project or assignment given..<br><br>Lecturers some are really ass holes, but they are also like your superior whom you can't afford to offend, so basically poly is like another "job training" for young people like us.<br><br>therefore i think going into poly is not really a bad choice at all. Its only dependant on how you look at it. You'll meet some very close friends and you will meet those really you-feel-like-killing-them-friends...<br><br>So yeah. I would think that its sort of like...  a step ahead for us compared to the JC students. Because most.. [&lt;--take note i said some...] of JC students are hardworking and smart unlike poly peeps who are usually not as strong as compared to JC people.<br><br>yeap my 2 cents. no flaming. hahah....<br><br>afterall, I'm a kid from poly too.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In poly the most impt skill you must have is team work. If you are those solo worker or free rider sort, in project discussion i would have to say goodluk to you. Cause soon you will be a outcast in your class, ya thats true, it's reality. Who would want a free-rider to share the same grade with you and doing nothing, or a bloody dominating bastard to kill your ideas all the time.<br><br>i went poly, being an introvert, first few weeks aren't easy. But soon i got to a bunch of good friends in my class, and soon we formed a big clique of 12 peeps. yeah! i was considered lucky enough to get into such class. i've heard lots of resentment my colleague and sec sch frens had in their poly class. Esp in those hot-grab course in poly, with low COP, backstabbing and politics issues in inveitable.<br><br>But i have to say i nvr regret opting for poly route! oh 2 more papers and it mark my end of poly year 1! haha wish me luck  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It really depends. You said all these because you been through poly and not JC. JC people like us also have our bad setbacks. Full of politics, stress, competition and teachers which can't even be bothered. It is the same.<br><br>Poly and Uni have everything the same in common, as in their lifestyles and teachings. What problems your facing are really subjective. I have friends who enjoyed themselves so much in poly, able to balance time play and study together, scoring well in everything and entering local Uni.<br><br>FYI, poly students who enter Uni has a big over advantage over jc student, time spent there and the practical knowledge and skills learned. It juz a repeat.<br><br>So if you say, i think poly its good as you know how to be independent, managing your time well and study hard. If you do so, i think poly beats JC anytime.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This was my last week of Poly, and this is all I have to say to those who are unsure of whether to go into Poly or JC.<br><br>...<br><br>I hated secondary school and O Levels, and never wanted to go through the same thing again in JC (plus A levels are harder). I was interested in one particular media, but like most students wasn't so sure if I'd regret taking a more specialized course later on, so I applied for multimedia and got in.<br><br>In my course I learned a wide range of disciplines, and naturally took to certain modules better. So, when it came to choosing electives in subsequent semesters, I chose the ones that I really had an interest in and really concentrated and did well in them. The compulsory modules that I had no interest in, I didn't put in as much effort, and TBH I can't remember much from them. But, at no point in time did I even bother with getting a high GPA; I just did my best in the areas I was interested in and, of course, scrape through the boring ones.<br><br>By being focused on at least a few key modules, I developed a deep bond with the respective lecturers and my other classmates who shared the same passion, and so doing assignments became pretty damn fun, and I can only stress that there is where your friends come from: doing assignments.<br><br>And when it came to doing assignments I purposely did it with different groups of people throughout my 3 years of study: I had my Fun Video Crew, the Introverted Hardworking Bunch and my Last Minute Overnight Group. This is because each clique has its own strengths and weaknesses. Plus, I also made more friends. Furthermore, if there are any backstabbers in one group, you always can rely on another. (In any case I didn't kena from such people since I interacted with different groups...I find that people who stay in only one group for too long are more susceptible to this nonsense)<br><br>As for juggling studies and play, you don't have to worry so much now if you're unsure about this. All you have to do is go to class (at least enough not to get a warning letter) and hand in your assignments on time. Soon enough you'll know who you can work with, how much of an impact CCAs will affect your studies (I didn't take up one btw), how much you can get away with with last minute work and how much free time you have etc. etc.. Oh yeah, and it helps if you go to the orientation camp...you'll get a head start in making friends and knowing people outside your course (can be handy, as that's the only time you can interact so freely with them).<br><br>I think that all in all Poly was a great experience, and it helped me to know myself better; I discovered my natural strengths through doing assignments with others, and when I blundered, people told me what I had done wrong. I'm glad I did the work that I did with the people that I worked with and made the mistakes that I would've made eventually in the workplace. In short, I really learned and had fun attending Poly.<br><br>...<br><br>And that's the extent of my experience in Poly. When choosing between JC and Poly it all boils down to you; chances are if you don't like secondary school and O Levels you won't like JC. Personally, I don't regret taking my course, not even over the more specialized one because of all the friendships I've made.<br><br>Someone asked earlier if we Poly peeps still keep in contact with each other; this week I managed to persuade the Last Minute Overnight Group to go out together for the first time! So yeah, my conclusion is that people are everything, and that means you, the lecturers and your classmates. Get to know them well!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>from my perspective.Ok.Poly generally for first year can be kind of normal bah...modules chicken feat more time to slack and play outside and go for CCAs....depending on ur sch system...i heard from my frens in RP that they almost change class every half semester or what.I think is see which poly and course you are in that results in the frequency of class changing.<br>Mine changed once only during start of year 2.They streamed my course people into different concentration options.So,make as many good friends in your classes.Friends made in poly can go far...in work life.You may need them in future i guess?...and projects can be a killer man.Depending in what course you are in...the amount of energy,brain cells and time spent on them varies...Back stabbers,competition are all part of school life.Sometimes competing within the class is just like in the outside world i guess...No sharing of project secrets...,people so called chatting with you but they wanted to "tao hua" from you regarding your projects..Scheming right?...well well...<br><br>poly' great.Prepares students for the real working world with relevant skills-be it hard" or soft.</div>
