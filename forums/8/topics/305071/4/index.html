This shouldn't be happening especially in places like Singapore.<br>No one should be marginalized in seeking knowledge due to his inability to fork out money for that knowledge. Conversely, if you want to study in uni overseas, be prepared to have money then.<br><br>-why do you have to hire tuition teachers? One has to learn and be independent. If you can't understand stuffs that lecturers teach, ask. If one requires the guidance of tuition teachers for subjects i school, i have doubts about him being able to cope well in the working world.<br><br>-There are only a few universities in SG so it's fair that only capable people are able to graduate with degrees. There are so many degree holders in SG guess it's important that they are capable.</div>

It is this: The government needs for workers to work in stuff like casino etc. So it encourages more ppl to join polys by showing how 'hip and cool' poly life is. Idiots fall for the trap without figuring out that they are screwing up their life in the long term. When they finally realize their mistake its too late cos only very few of them are able to make it to university.<br><br>Morale:Choosing Poly is like having sex with a prostitute. You get short term satisfaction but probably screwed up by some STD in the long run.</div></blockquote>I was a poly student and I went on to University , got my masters plus now sponsored for higher research studies from an australian agency with a paid salary.<br><br>Just think out of the box on what you can do rather than to just see only what the government says. Think for yourself rather than get someone else to think for you, which is unfortunately a trap some Singaporeans fall into as in Government says therefore must be good.<br><br></div>
