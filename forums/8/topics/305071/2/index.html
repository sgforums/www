            <div class='col-md body'>i agree with the kid. polys resort to advertising how cool they are to entice students to go there. even though there is increased awareness of the pros of poly education (which i agree to) in reality the common perception is that jc is better.</div>

It is this: The government needs for workers to work in stuff like casino etc. So it encourages more ppl to join polys by showing how 'hip and cool' poly life is. Idiots fall for the trap without figuring out that they are screwing up their life in the long term. When they finally realize their mistake its too late cos only very few of them are able to make it to university.<br><br>Morale:Choosing Poly is like having sex with a prostitute. You get short term satisfaction but probably screwed up by some STD in the long run.</div></blockquote>oooo....so you think people go poly juz to become casino operator issit?<br><br>please lah, not everybody have the same fate......<br><br>besides, i think people who try finding jobs will get higher pay then jc.......</div>

From what i had experienced, in jc you would definitely have MORE frens, cause there arent much backstabbers there. I would not say completely no, but the number is really little.<br><br>But when u come to poly, omfg its totally different. If u have that slack mentality then all the best to u, u will still need to study one. In poly, the backstabbers that u meet will be plentiful. In front of u they might act frenly cause u are their so called 'classmate' , when u wanna look for them for help, they dont give a damn n try their best NOT to help u.<br><br>This is highly due to poly mates wanting to snatch the freaking 5% slot for uni, if i were u i would go JC and WORK my ASS off. BUT not forgetting my social life in jc, have fun make lots of frens and then enjoy yr 2 yrs in jc and at the same time get good grades go to uni. All the best =)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>someone who said dat must be so depressed of his or her poly life.<br><br>i am someone who hav been thru two system before. i finished J1 with a v bad grade and hence i moved to poly to start anew.<br><br>JC - u feel much closer to ur frenz and classmates, not much of class politics cause  everybody busy studying. u go sch early in the morning, study till evening, den go home, no time for playing. except for PW, u dun really have much projects to handle and thus also contributing to the factor dat nt much class politics. However, ur studies very stressed out. Somemore u only mix around with ur dat grp of frenz. i admit, i used to be an art class students, and i do not know many of science class students in my jc except for my cca pple.<br><br>Poly- u hav a wider grp of frenz, thus, maybe nt so close due to the fact dat u hav more frenz (some courses changes the class around, maybe more difficult to find more close frenz). More time for studies, den hav to handle more projects. u get to mix with a wider grp of frenz. but also equals to more class politics and "backstabbing".<br><br>When i was in JC, true, JC teachers always says dat poly lecturers dun give a damn to u la, blah blah blah. but when i moved to poly, it wasnt as bad as a i thought. When i was in poly, there was one instance when i forgot to hand up one of the assignment, my poly lecturer actually email me to chase me for it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  Somemore, they are v willing to help u and go the extra mile for u if u consult them. I STRESS THE WORD, TAKING INITIATVE TO CONSULT YOUR LECTURER! i am sure they will not reject u, or rather, no lecturer will reject u if u take initiative to consult them YOURSELF.<br><br>each has its own advantage. i suggest dat one who has chosen his or her path shld nt regret or whine abt it.<br><br></div>

From what i had experienced, in jc you would definitely have MORE frens, cause there arent much backstabbers there. I would not say completely no, but the number is really little.<br><br>But when u come to poly, omfg its totally different. If u have that slack mentality then all the best to u, u will still need to study one. In poly, the backstabbers that u meet will be plentiful. In front of u they might act frenly cause u are their so called 'classmate' , when u wanna look for them for help, they dont give a damn n try their best NOT to help u.<br><br>This is highly due to poly mates wanting to snatch the freaking 5% slot for uni, if i were u i would go JC and WORK my ASS off. BUT not forgetting my social life in jc, have fun make lots of frens and then enjoy yr 2 yrs in jc and at the same time get good grades go to uni. All the best =)</div></blockquote>Of course, u go everywhere u hav to work hard.<br>look for ur lecturer...<br>and not everyone is selfish.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i quite agree leh. on the backstabbers part. thr's probably none who will really treat you as a friend. mostly just an act. for me, i always try to keep a distance. don't wanna really treat them as 'friends' but instead, classmate</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Totally and utterly disagree.<br><br>Firstly, no one will tell you that Poly is a breeze compared to Sec school.  Whoever who tells you that is an idiot.  A Polytechnic is an institution of HIGHER learning.  It means you need to take a pro-active approach to your work.  No one is gonna chase you to make your submissions.  No one is gonna make you stay back and finish your work "After School."  You've gotta motivate yourself to do that.<br><br>Secondly, You meet liars, backstabbers and unhelpful people everywhere. Love them or hate them, up to you.  All in all, you learn a real world lesson.  Know how are your enemies and who are your friends.  Invaluable.<br><br>Thirdly, Poly life can be fun.  I know I said you have to proactive and hardworking in Poly.  But there is always room for play.  Find a CCA that you like to join, and you'll meet even more friends with a common interest.  Polytechnic facilities are also top of the line.  Swimming pools, tracks, soccer fields, badminton courts, tennis courts, Gaming Centers, lounges, and the list goes on.  You learn how to balance work and play. Another important life skill if you ask me.<br><br>My poly experience was pretty good. I spent 60% of my time studying, and 40% playing in year 1.  40% studying and 60% playing in Year 2, and 30% studying and 70% playing or hanging loose.  Curriculum time is not specified so I could play as much as I want as long as I can maintain my A's &amp; B's.   Work Smart, Play Hard.  You won't get this kinda "freedom" to manage your studies in JC.  But it sure prepares you for uni.</div>

Poly... Crap!...<br><br>Thankfully im taking my last exam paper nxt monday b4 i can finally say im Poly-student-no-more<br><br>from <a href="http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/showthread.php?t=1848636" rel="nofollow">edmw</a><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>frankly speaking, i agree wif majority things he stated regarding poly life. cos i had seen many students who scored well in olvl did badly in poly. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> [/b]</blockquote>Nah... I would say poly life is:<br><br>1) Free, as in Homework-free, stress-free (except when near exam and assignment dateline  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> but basically its kinda fun as in rushing for it.)<br><br>2) Slacking, lecturer won't even bother are your paying attention or not. To tell you the truth, i never really listen in class, I just surf net or play games on my laptop with my classmates (Please do not learn this, but i doubt you will listen  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> ). Well, that will depends on the lecturer, some lecturers forbid using laptop in class because well, that module doesn't require laptop at all.<br><br>3) About backstabbers... yea sure there are some, I mean it doesn't matter where you go, there are backstabbers everywhere. Yes, that includes JC. the bottomline if you want to survive in poly is to socialise I think.<br><br>Well, if anyone is going to say poly life is stressful, they should take a look at JC instead. I seen friends in JC complaining lots of homework and too stressful, some cannot cope and in the end drop out of JC and enter poly instead. Whereas, what am I doing? Playing computer games everyday at home.<br><br></div>
