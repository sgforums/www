              <p>Allow me to attempt an objective view on the Matrix.</p>
              <p>How do we know we are alive? My answer is simply through our 5 sensory perceptions-see,smell, hear, touch and taste. If we can sense all these in our daily interaction, then indeed we are alive. If you cant, then you are likely dead already.</p>
              <p>(The question is about being alive and what's real or virtual, and NOT about being intelligent or stupid, or the different states of matter, organic or inorganic developements, unquantifiably 'emotional feeling' responses, etc) </p>
              <p>To recreate such senses in the virtual world, in the past, the closest was dreams. How do we know it had been a dream? Put your sense analysis to the test, and somehow, if most senses are not present, then it is not real, unless of course, you are impaired without one of the senses - such as being deaf,  or blind, etc.</p>
              <p>For the absolutely impaired, without all 5 senses, they are still real in the physical world, but only to us, for our senses will tell us they are real. But to the physically impaired, we may not be real to them. Note the difference.</p>
              <p>Under current tech, the closest to creating a replicate world are the advance helmut systems which you put on. The sense of sight, hearing, and to some extent-smell, can be created within a lab environment. Touch and tasting is still virtually impossible. For something such as the matrix, the computing power to run it would be vast.</p>
              <p>But probably in the future, it may be possible as chip making has gone into biological experimentation currently, created using cellular size properties nanotechnically and with their own bio coolant systems.</p>
              <p>So, today, are we perhaps living in a re-created advanced sensory world called the matrix we know nothing about? Our senses and current comprehension of science tells us - NO.</p>
              <p>But I would presume a nagging suspicion persists - what about known unknowns that the matrix may exist beyond our comprehension?</p>
              <p>All I know is that if i dont work, there will be no money to pay bills, and i would starved to death. This is a reality, nothing virtual,  whereby no one had ever returned to tell us what happens to us after we die.</p>
              <p>So, my point is - dont crack your head. Death and taxes are a reality today. Do something about it than to worry about 'unknowns'.</p>
              <p>( I will not dwell on the 6th sense, as it is still not scientifically proven that it exists.)</p>

              <p>Thanks for your kind words. Sorry, I have moved far beyond JC, and could be of no help to you in your elective Knowledge and Iquiry.</p>
              <p>If the Matrix fascinates you, perhaps I would recommend that you read science journals in our libraries, attend seminars or download their peer reviewed papers.</p>
              <p>Most interesting, and just another thought out of the box for you that I learnt during overseas seminars - rather than to replicate the senses within a computerised model for the hurdle of touch and taste, neuroscience and its technology may hold the breakthrough one day.</p>
              <p>Imagine yourself in a beach now. You walk in it, and imagine the feel of sand on your feet. You reach to the shoreline and dip your hand into the waters. You can imagine the density of water. You bring it up to your lips and taste the water. You imagine it is salty.</p>
              <p>Imagination is the key word - memory responses. If such neurological  responses can be technologically created to trigger such memories, then we may be closer to replicating our world into the 'Matrix' one day.</p>
              <p>But as i had mentioned, we are alive and real in this world, with reality of death being a sure thing. Thus we must do what we can to avert this fate while we are still young, capable, and delay it as long as possible, to sense our current world and .....live life.</p>
              <p>Good luck and cheers <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>Just sharing some thoughts to excercise the brain cells.</p>
              <p>If someone tells me we are living in an illusionary world, then I would suggest he jumps off the 20th floor of a building. If he lands safe and sound on his feet, I would become an instant believer!</p>
              <p>But then some still claim life is an illusion. To some extent, I will agree, but only when specifically applied for events of the future.  Today is a reality, but tomorrow is unknown. Science and various beliefs had never been able to predict accurately the future factually.</p>
              <p>For simple eg:</p>
              <p>1.) Those who bought insurance or derivatives before the financial crisis now realized that they had been living in an illusion. They worked hard and sacrifice their savings turning them into financial instruments for retirement.</p>
              <p>Charts, statistics, graphs, trends, past histories, etc, were trotted out to prove the viability of such investments, which in truth are based on PROBABILITIES, and not scientific facts, which is why, in fine and small print, they often state any sum assured is not guaranteed, or, they are subject to market conditions.</p>
              <p>When you combine 2 elements of hydrogen to one of Oxygen you get water. When you boil water at 100 degress celsius, it turns into steam. This are science facts, irrefutable, getting the same results no matter how many times you repeat it.1+1 will always be 2 no matter how many times you repeat this calculation. Same for 1+1X2=3 (heirachy of mathematical operators). These are mathematical facts.</p>
              <p>However, when one attempts to predict the future base on past historical data, it is nonsense that it is possible. The future is NEVER deterministic. Randomness is an unquantifiable and unmeasurable unit based on our current understanding of Maths and Science. At best any mathematical prediction is only a guide and not a fact. At worse, it is at least more credible than astrology and fortune telling.( some may disgree on  this)</p>
              <p>Alan Greenspan found that out till too late, and so did many in the world and even our own citizens too, realized that they had been living in a dream and their future of a rich retirement only an illusion.</p>
              <p>2.) When you were told to study hard, examples were made of grads or scholars having a good and rich life, thus one must study hard and be a grad. Many believed it, and worked for it. Depending on which economic cycle a grad becomes one, he will live the dream. Today, in this recessionary cycle, many out of job grads or stuck in lower pay jobs realized that life had been illusion.</p>
              <p>But does that mean there is no hope, that nothing we do can alter our future? Not true, because of 2 facts. A) We know that Death is certain. B) Changes in life is also certain.</p>
              <p>Therefore, the solution lies in being adaptable. Like a frog that is adaptable to its environment, hot or cold, so comfortably adaptable that it may either freezed or fried to death. But we are not frogs, because we have the brains to know when it gets to too cold or too hot, and make the necessary changes to ourselves or our environment.</p>
              <p>In summary, to those who claim life is an illusion, it is only because they have not the courage to be adaptable to changes, and make the most of it. While the future is uncertain, today is still a reality we must live. </p>
              <p>No one controls the future or can control it. It can only be predicted, but still, it is only a prediction and not a fact. It is us, who will determine our own future by making the necessary decisions to prepare for it today and staying adaptable to any changes, which is certain to arise along the journey of life, to either sail towards our goals or hieve into uncharted waters.</p>
              <p>Just sharing a thought, and not making any claims that I am right, or intend to impose my views onto anyone. Cheers</p>
