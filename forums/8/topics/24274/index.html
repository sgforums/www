Guys don't get your ears twisted off?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">) Then I also remember that our EZLink card is actually coupled with our identity...?<br><br>WHICH MEANS THAT our movements have been CLOSELY MONITORED in a sense...? Though this can be used as quite a good alibi thing, but somehow I suspect it's MORE than that... Guess Singaporeans are just too busy with their lives that they didn't realise quite ALOT of 'things' and 'systems' are SHAPING UP behind their back...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
