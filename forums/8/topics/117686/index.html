            <div class='col-md body'>this is such a joke.<br><br>I admit that my NS life was hell. I saw people being physically being abused and was mentally drained. But it was not the focus on the measly pay or the lack of benefits. Neither was it about doing the same job as a regular and earning no bonus and only drawing an allowance. If your mindset is as such, then you'll always have a problem whereever you go. So... if there is no performance bonus just because the company is not doing well, can I expect people to work less diligently?<br><br>Put things in their perspectives and take on roles more positively. Immagine if your sons or daughters were to tell you that the amount the contribute to the family was pegged to the allowance they recieved. That'll trully be the end for you.</div>
