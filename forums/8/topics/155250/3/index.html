Unless you can produce any evidence my parents are cheating IRAS and if you want speak with their accountant firm who do their taxes. Do not ever imply my parents are cheats. If you wish to pursue this further, let me contact the accountant and engage a lawyer. I am dead serious when you slander my parents like this. </div></blockquote>my original statement was<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by I-like-flings(m):</div><div class="quote_body">do u know that alot of hawker under declare their earning???</div></blockquote>which part of that did i say ALL HAWKERS? and when did is say it's ur parent that did that??...hmmmm why so work up if they never DID it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> and as your parent are earning so LITTLE now, i advice you to tell them that there are free tax filing services every year by poly student at CC nowadays dun waste money paying those accounting firm lah... unless of coz it's already FREE now.. wow that firm which name ar?? if they really give free services then we can help them promote here lah.. and they can help more ppl right?<br><br>and about the lawyer... pls save dun waste their money as they are earning so little already..... u dun even have a case, even if the lawyer is FREE again... u will be ask to pay the court charges too when u lose the case.. and that one.. our government wont be so nice to give FREE service one.. that one is confirm....<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by mistyblue:</div><div class="quote_body">If the system is not working for him, then It is not the society/government/everyone's work to solve his issues for him.

So what qualifications do you have to make such sweeping statements about the way things are run? Are you a CEO or managing director? Or a minister of some major department? If you cannot do sh!t, don't make too much noise with so much baseless useless comments. </div></blockquote>my dearest darling, are CEO or managing director or minister ALWAYS RIGHT??? OMG if we are not one of the above then we cannot talk?? cannot hope they can change?? no CEO are born as CEO leh... so when he was a junior staff he cannot talk ar?? if he is really a YES MAN, i really doubt he will be the CEO he is now<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by mistyblue:</div><div class="quote_body">If you only know how to come here and fib nonsense and talk about inane things while acting high and mighty with all that glorified women are object sh!t.
