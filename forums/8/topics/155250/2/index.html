Struggle hard and unit till my oldest sis gave up schooling to work for the family.<br><br>Do not think all hawkers under declare their earnings. Do not sweep all people into the same carteory as dishonest because they are hawkers. Besides, You have no right to slander my parent and you have no evidence. Unless you can produce any evidence my parents are cheating IRAS and if you want speak with their accountant firm who do their taxes. Do not ever imply my parents are cheats. If you wish to pursue this further, let me contact the accountant and engage a lawyer. I am dead serious when you slander my parents like this.<br><br>If the system is not working for me, then It is not the society/government/everyone's work to solve his issues for him. Everyone who study work out a solution for themselves.  So what if the school system/bursary/etc sucks. Can You, My dearest, come out a better system that help everyone that should be helped. So what qualifications do you have to make such sweeping statements about the way things are run? Are you a CEO or managing director? Or a minister of some major department? If you cannot do sh!t, don't make too much noise with so much baseless useless comments.<br><br>If you only know how to come here and fib nonsense and talk about inane things while acting high and mighty with all that glorified women are object sh!t. Then really, one lesson you never learn is that silence is sometimes golden. Pick the right fights. Don't pick fights with the wrong people and fight a worthy fight. Do not think I do not know and would not talk back. Mutterficker, you don't know the tip of it and You have picked the wrong day to make my piss.<br><br></div>
