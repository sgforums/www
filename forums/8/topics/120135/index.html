Education on safe sex via the use of contraceptive pills and condoms should be aired in the media and in schools. You cannot stop people from having sex, but you can teach them how to take proper precautions. At the very least you can teach girls to insist on the guy wearing a condom, or take the pill themselves. Some have opined that by doing this you are condoning immoral behaviour(gawd what century are we living in) but has sweeping the problem underneath the carpet done any good at all?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
