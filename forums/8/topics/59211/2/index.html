from where it will begin, it will end.<br>At that time I am your enemy and your friend.<br>The shadow lies behind the light,<br>The darkness shall bring the plight,<br>Doom shall befall on all,<br>Doom shall come to Eor.<br><br>I am the shadows and the rays,<br>Before the gods have seen better days.<br>Soon when it will start to light up, it will cease.<br>I shall do whatever I please.<br>The light shines brightly at the shadow,<br>The darkness will eventually follow,<br>Doom will be gone,<br>Where doom is born.<br><br>I am all of everything but also none,<br>What the gods have never done.<br>Soon it will disappear and be gone forever.<br>I shall rule with my powers over those who never.<br>The light and the shadow shall stay together side by side,<br>While the darkness shall stop the tide,<br>Doom will continue again,<br>From where it all begin.<br><br>Senseless with the feelings in my soul,<br>I am the healer and the ghoul.<br>The Weaver of time and space,<br>Who has given all grace.<br>Out of the void was mere black ocean,<br>Out of the day was there some motion.<br>The star that represented this is First,<br>The one that will remain as the history's curse.<br><br>Bringer of the future and the past,<br>I am the first and the last.<br>The Painter of light and fire,<br>When all bleem and burn with desire.<br>Out of the flame was mere ashes,<br>Out of the brightness was there flashes.<br>The star that symbolized this is Second,<br>The one that will remain as the history began.<br><br>Judge of the future and the present,<br>I am a peasant while being the regent.<br>The Drafter of volume and air,<br>Which gives all a different flair.<br>Out of the atmosphere was mere breeze,<br>Out of the emptiness was there increase.<br>The star that depicted this is Red,<br>The one that will remain even if history can wade.<br><br>This is what that had been before and after,<br>For I am the creator and the destroyer.<br>The Sculptor of life and earth,<br>Where all will live and serve.<br>Out of the soil was mere ore,<br>Out of the living will they bore.<br>The star that portrayed this is Green,<br>The one that will remain on the history screen.<br><br>Passing it all through the fullest and the least,<br>I am the beauty and the beast.<br>The Sketcher of wave and water,<br>How all hear and descended from the father.<br>Out of the rain was mere fluid pouring,<br>Out of the ripple was there liquid shaking.<br>The star that illustrated this is Blue,<br>The one that will remain as history's clue.<br><br>The visions can be found on the star Sage,<br>While Last shows the great history till the last page.<br>The doors to and fro the greatest times found here,<br>The messages can be seen written there as the wordings are big and clear.<br>From the First to the Last, the seven stars,<br>Where the history is written on etched scars.<br>In the skies of heaven, the five universes,<br>From which I derive my verses.<br><br>My name is not forgiven,<br>Nor that of the forgotten.<br>My name is found written on the beds of the seas,<br>Where the dead are found crying with their pleas.<br>My soul is stretching to reach its destination,<br>To where there is no absolution.<br>To where perfect is never perfect, no longer perfect,<br>To where the wrong has not even a single defect.<br><br>Besiege those who did fail,<br>Begone those who did wail.<br>For I never allowed them to stand anymore,<br>As they resembled nothing I bore.<br>Bewildered those who had the clues,<br>Belittled those who were the fools.<br>For I never want them again,<br>As they should no longer remain.<br><br>Good can be evil, while bad is not always the devil.<br>Once more, twice before.<br>Birth brings death, the only they have.<br>The future is too few while the past is too new.<br>What has begun in the future, is a continuation of nature.<br>Where it all be, no longer it is free.<br>Trap within the circle, dead or alive,<br>Trap within the universe and you will not strive.<br><br>Hear, see and feel the wonders in the world,<br>Listen, watch and touch the miracles of the stir.<br>Universe and heaven will no longer be around,<br>As they will no longer be found.<br>When that time shall tick on the clock,<br>When the era has finally arrived on the last block.<br>The doors to deformation shall open,<br>The reformation shall have its turn.<br><br>The elements of death and birth,<br>A world of hate and love.<br>A time to link everyone's heart,<br>A time for all to depart.<br>The hourglass keeps running lowly,<br>The clock ticking away slowly.<br>Everything will start from the beginning,<br>Where there is no ending.<br><br>This is the story of the world where it happens before aeon,<br>And this story will continue on and on.<br>The returning of the cycle,<br>The imperfect circle.<br>The gods fear my presence,<br>For they will lose their essence.<br>May it be that all will die,<br>May it be that none will ask why.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr.
