            <div class='col-md body'>Who benefit Baby Bonus Co-Saving scheme more ?? Some poor people can't even fork out savings to put inside bank every month, there-fore, how are they going to enjoy the Baby Bonus Co-Saving scheme? So this favours the well off who can afford to save.. Its like the govt saying "Tomorrow I'll give everyone $10M provided you already have $10M"....such co-savings schemes only favor the rich.. If the use of the money is already controlled, why require the poor to co-save when they can't...<br><br>With the income disparity becoming larger, I can't formulate who the govt are trying to help here.. couples nowsadays for-sake wedding banquet and other formalities and save what-ever they can.. they will struggle to pay for their pigeon hole and use what little money left for their retiring parents medical fee's.. with future sons education and parents aging problems in mind, how much can they saved each month ?<br><br>There is little to address the changes in our economy and the existence now is of a sizable chronic unemployed and the long term poor.. We should identify them as a group, and protect them against escalating costs which affects them more than other Singaporeans..<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, let's put it this way. At least, last yr they made 1 change whereby the govt will issue the cash bonus within 18 mths in 4 payments. Rather than before it was 6 payments within 6 yrs!<br><br>Also the recently budget announcement, they decided to allow parents to put more than $1k in a yr in the co-savings. Hard to explain. It makes it easier for alot of pple...cos some people might have more savings one yr and have less savings another yr. At least they allow that.<br><br>I am happy...at least it does make life easier for some of us that are not too poor or not too rich.<br><br>govt cannot please everyone.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

SO why implement rules that you must had 1k to qualify for 1k ? whats the driven motive here...</div>
