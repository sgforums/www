Who wouldnt? Almost every youth in sg wants to be a model. Easy cash.<br><br>If you have to pay for the makeover portfolio, chances are, it could be crap.<br><br>Most serious scouting agencies have their own in-house make up artists. You will prob pay for the printing and the plastic portfolio itself, but that doesnt come up too much.</div>

( up to about 25 % recently)<br><br>Hope your friend managed to get things resolved. The top models normally work in sg for a while then leave for more exposure cos honestly, you can get big clients in sg but most other jobs pay peanuts.<br><br>And sg currently has an infatuation with european and pan asian foreign models.
