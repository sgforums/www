            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, two months ago I met an awesome girl who literally was 'the girl of my dreams'. I appraoched every week in the same pub and never came on heavy, simply bought her a drink, had a chat, then went home or to a club. Four weeks ago I found out it was her birthday and gave her some money while in the pub - and then left on my own, without even thinking she'd join me.<br><br>The next week I saw her again and she invited me to sit with her and talk, so we did and found we had so much in common.<br><br>Needless to say we ended up back at mine (she asked me!) and since then have only spent one night apart. We get on like a house on fire.<br><br>However... (and you knew that was coming right?)...<br><br>This afternoon she says she can never see me again as she bumped into her ex and realised she still has feelings for him.<br><br>I was/am devastated. Her friend called and went mad saying she mustn't go back to her ex - but what can I do?<br><br>This guy broke her leg, her arm, her ribs, and her nose a little while ago... and she's going back to him.<br><br>She did admit that she had never known anyone as nice as I was.<br><br>Was that my downfall?<br><br>Solaar<br>hoping someone knows how I can win her back.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi solaar,<br><br>Sorry about the loss man....and I think that many of us already know that people in violent or abusive relationships find it the hardest to break away from....It is almost impossible to find a way out, and usually these girls will go back to the source of that abuse again...in this case the X-BF.<br><br>It's a sad fact that humans are like this, but it's all psycholgical.  thru the abuse, the guy is able to control her...and in controlling her, breaks her will, and in breaking her will, has her totally.  She will find  it very hard to leave him for very long because there's an expectation and a psychological need for that abuse and control...and a bit of fear.<br><br>It's not that she consciously wants this kind of life, but u can't fight ur subconscious mind man...and I hate..HATE guys that beat up women....especially their wife or GF.  It's really low, and most of the time the guy is just very insecure about himself and his relationships.  These types of guys are worse than dogs and have no guts when it comes down to the crunch.<br><br>If u were to challenge him for her or try and win her, definately you would everything over this type of guy....but unfortunately, the fear, and addiction to the abuse is there and it's very powerful...and noone can make her let go but herself...and the fact that she's going back to him is just a big sign that says that she won't be breaking away for a long time.....<br><br>Sorry to be the harbinger of bad news, but just wanted to let u know....but like I said,  I don't know u, but just knowing that fact about the X-Bf, I already know his personality type...U have nothing to feel bad about, and he's no threat to u...it's just that his chances of getting the girl will most likely be almost infitisimally higher than u...Unless u really put ur heart and soul into and make her realise gradually and gently that she deserves better than that kind of life....<br><br>the question is whether u have the stamina, endurance, and commitment to pull it off...<br><br>If u do, good luck and all the best...keep us posted on how it goes...that's what the board is for...:-)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firewire - the world needs more people like you, man.<br><br>I stayed at my flat till 11pm last night and left her a message saying that I'd be there if she needed me. She didn't turn up so I left for my mums where I was staying the night (on the way my car ran out of petrol in a stretch of woods... I just wish I hadn't seen the Blair Witch Project last week...) but I got home eventually.<br><br>I slept fitfully and was awoken by a message on my phone at 7am from my gfriend asking if I was ok. I replied that it was she that I was concerned about.<br><br>Then followed an admission by her that she felt she'd chosen the wrong guy (him) and was now really confused. She asked me to wait for her and my answer was only if she wasn't waiting to see if she could sort things out with him.<br><br>Now, I'm meeting her tonight. I'm just leaving for work all done to the 9s (ie, smartly) as I work across the road from her. I think it's that male animal thing about impressing the female, right?<br><br>Still, the first hurdle is overcome and now I have to build on it.<br><br>Solaar<br>thanking Firewire again</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Solaar..<br>I admire your stance.But I doubt your ability. I agree with firewire. i have seen / experience similar situations before. Its going to be a uphill climb.<br><br>If this is a genuine case, she would be controlled by this ex of hers and its very difficult for you to save her. I would suspect that all her girl friends have tried to save her but she still ended up with him.<br>Guys like that should be shot. Between the legs.<br><br>If this is a con job. (Which is possible) You stand to lose not only emotions but money. Because that happended before.<br><br>I wished you all the best.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I dunno about you guys. But I feel what <strong>Solaar</strong> did was really great and deserves a good pat on the back. The power of love is really strong in someone. And I admire you for tat, Solaar.<br><br>I think the thing about some girls is that they don't like the guys doing their every wishes. They want the guys to stand up for themselves and to argue back at them or something.<br><br>I lost my girlfriend because she said I was just too easily giving in to her every beck and call. I mean look at it this way guys, you don't do as she says.. she says you're disloyal, you're not trustworthy. You do as she says and she says you've no backbone and no self-respect.<br><br>*sighz* I think it was more of an excuse than ever. But I was long over her a long time ago.<br><br>I think love is really great. But one question I've always wondered to myself is I never wanted to be in love until I really fell in love. wait.. Let me rephrase. I fell in love, and when it ended, I told myself I dun wanna fall in love again, coz the pain is too great. But you just can't forget that sort of feeling you felt, like a young child in a candy store, the excitement, the fun, the love, the caring, the holding, the hugging.. *sighz* everything in love..<br><br>I was just talking to a friend recently about relationships and he started saying something like "Once you've loved, you're addicted to it". I think it's quite true!<br><br>Just my two cents,<br><br>------------------<br>Yours Sincerely,<br><br>*~RoMeo~*</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Killjoy + Firewire - I understand and appreciate your words, but I believe I have enough faith in myself to convince her that I am the right guy for her.<br><br>RoMeo - a two cents well spent! Thanx for your words.<br><br>Anyway, yesterday she came in to see me on her lunch hour and quickly broke down crying. I comforted her and told her that whoever she picked that I would always be there for her. I was mad as well, cos if she picked him he would never let her see me or talk to me - which is a shame as we got on like best friends.<br><br>Before she left she gathered herself up and simply asked me to stick with her. I said I would.<br><br>Then she phoned me later and asked me to pick her up after her driving exam - which I did. And it was then that she told me she wanted to be with me.<br><br>She then phoned him (i offered to leave but she declined) and told him there and then that she wanted to have nothing to do with her.<br><br>Needless to say this nut started issuing threats to her which pissed me off.<br><br>Anyway, she's back with me and I'm happy. The only forseeable problem now is this ex-boyfriend. A womanbeater.<br><br>Now, I'm a Londoner as are my friends and family and we don't take kindly to that, and my girlfriend is a very well-liked girl - so I think that the repurcussions may well swing his way.<br><br>I just hope we don't cross paths just yet.<br><br>Solaar<br>still confused but a little happier</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firewire - thanks again!! She's well and truly under my protection now and I think she feels safer knowing that I'd sooner punch someone else than her.<br><br>Another interesting development though, Fire, is that she just phoned and said he was lurking around outside her shop and ringing her phone. I told her to hang tight and that I was on my way but she called back shortly after and told me that he had gone.<br><br>She also said the best thing was that she didn't get upset this time, which she usually does, and that she believes talking to him the other night finally got him out of her system.<br><br>And she came back to me. So, Firewire, Killjoy, [i]et al[i/] maybe this is one of those occasions where the good guy wins out? Or maybe it's the fact that I was so damn persistent and resilient that I wasn't gonna let her throw her life away on someone who didn't appreciate her and saw her as a tool for his 'power'.<br><br>Needless to say that one night soon that power will be swung backwards.<br><br>Solaar<br>PS - Hetero - what has my son got to do with all this?

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks Eck! I think that this last week has really taught me about relationships again and how much I appreciate my partner.<br><br>Before this relationship I was with a girl for two years and before that the mother of my twins for three years - and I'm only 23 now!<br><br>I've had more than my fair share of women along the way (jeez, dunno how I crammed them in! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> ) and the two major relationships I had were fairly good (although the first is now bad news).<br><br>But I digress, my gfriend means the world to me now and we really have connected in many ways - I guess thats why I was never gonna let the SoB get the better of me and I know she saw a far brighter future with me instead of him.<br><br>It's amazing that, at the beginning of this week, I was a mixture of confusion, anger, and pain - and yet the close of the week sees me within a giddy happiness that I can't (and don't) control!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Thanks to all the above guys for voicing their views and also for their help.

She said yep and he hung up!<br><br>Solaar<br>feeling better than he did at the beginning of the week</div>
