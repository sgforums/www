MediaCorp will write official letter to Mindef/CMPB in this case asking for deferment by 2 - 5 years until age 26.<br>(got people age 26 then start NS leh, u know)<br><br>if that quarter-finalist guy can get 2.5+ months of unaccounted leave during his NS(which is unbelivable but true), then Derrick's(or whichever winner) also no problem one. besides, even ordinary people like those ite/poly/JC boys you see on the street also have no problem applying for deferment, as long as they got good-enough reason. it's all considered as a case-by-case basis.<br>besides, the male winner of Project Superstart can always join the SAF Music and Drama company mah, so at the same time have the best of both worlds loh.<br><br><blockquote>anyway if they manage to win......they will still need to fulfill their ns requirement of 2 years.......by then all will forget them liao......who will go by their albums????</blockquote>yeah lah, this is where the real problem comes in, because they need still to serve NS in the end. but the best solution is to defer as much as possible, sell as much albums as possible and earn some money first mah.<br>at least better than nothing, right?<br><br>if they go NS after winning the competition without selling any song or doing any promotion, then total waste lah.<br><br>another grimer possibility is that MediaCorp may not let those finalists who haven't serve NS yet to win in the end. MediaCorp is a commercial company, remember. their higher-ups will make sure they reap the most profits from the winner and get more revenue.<br><br>there are 5 guys now in Project Superstar.<br>Derrick and that other guy who are waiting to enlisted may not win in the end. MediaCorp may come up with certain reasons for this.<br><br>the blind guy will most likely be among the last 3.<br>among these 3, the blind guy will be kick out sooner or later, because despite sympathy votes from SG folks, MediaCorp still wants a real superstar who can be marketed and has potential. reality is like this.<br>that blind guy will last into the final 2, if i'm not wrong.<br>because this way, the SG audience will get even hotter and emotions will start flowing in.<br>hotter == more emotions == more SMS == more votes == more profits<br>this is where the dream match begins.<br><br>so in the end, MediaCorp will choose the <strong>best</strong> singer out of the lot, and who also is not blind and has served NS already.<br>don't believe, just watch. it's not the talent they're looking for : it's the potential and marketability they want.<br><br>see ye',<br>nikar.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>think no need to watch liao cos the gals will win cos the rest of the guys cannot really make it.....</blockquote>but i thought they choose 1 guy and 1 girl at the finals? or will the winner of the boys team compete with the winner of the girls team? because if like that, then the final winner will surely be the girl, assuming that Kelly wins. after all, she got 40.5 at the revival match and this night she got 39.5. Song-bo!<br>the voting also like doesn't really affect who gets out or in leh, cos' if u watch closely, those with high points always get in one. maybe MediaCorp doesn't consider the votes(conspiracy)<br>tonight, i bet Ruth will surely be out. if not, Candyce.</div>

But after all, we still have the sun yan zi, ah du etc to do us proud.<br><br>One of my friend happen to know the last judge of the project superstar, i forget his name, the guy with the botak head. He mention that if wanna be a real successful singer dun go thru the singing competition like spore idol, project superstar etc. I wonder wats the point behind tat but base on the current scenerio, our local famous singer almost none come from singing competition.</div>
