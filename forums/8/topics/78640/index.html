I know it may be a surprise to you but I have just been officially informed that I have passed the final interview for obtaining the scholarship program in Master Of Arts in International Relations in OBLU.<br><br>The new semester starts in May but I will be leaving Singapore much earlier to prepare for this turning point in my life. I am very excited about this new opportunity. It will provide me with great exposure to the different parts of the world. The admission committee just approved my scholarship last week and now I am in progress of getting my visa. The scholarship also includes internships and immersions in various cities for real world experience.<br><br>I share this information with you - perhaps, you'd like to try this<br>opportunity too. Check out the attached file for more details on the<br>program. It is very interesting.<br><br>I will keep in touch.<br><br>"Life is short, live it to the Max!"<br><br>================================================<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>Commitment.Community.Jihad!</strong></span><br>Osama bin Laden University seeks to instill the fundamentals of terrorism in its students. Whether you want the glorious martyrdom of killing hundreds of infidels in an embassy bombing, or the more personal satisfaction of hunting down a blasphemous author in a mullah-sanctioned fatwa, OBLU can get you where you want go!If you can answer yes to even than half of the following, a career in terror may be for you!<br><br><span style="color: dark blue;">Yes!<br>I want to make a difference!<br>I can handle a challenge!<br>I can drive a truck!<br>I want to wipe that smirk off George Bush's face!<br>I enjoy waving guns around and firing them into the sky randomly at large rallies!<br>I look good in a vest filled with explosives!<br>I want a job that's to die for!</span><br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>ABOUT US</strong></span><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>CAMPUS</strong></span><br>Located in the magnificently rugged mountains of Afghanistan, OBLU's campus ranks as one of the most beautiful educational settings in the world. Miles of running trails wend their way through the snowy passes. And keeping a sharp eye out for land mines keeps fitness buffs strong in both body and mind!<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">CURRICULUM</span></strong><br><span class="small"><span style="font-style: italic;">Long a source of pride for students, the OBLU honor code is strictly enforced</span></span><br>All our students start off with a solid basis in the core areas of modern terrorism. By the end of freshman year, you will know how to: lob stones effectively, burn flags without burning yourself, chant angry slogans for hours thanks to foot-friendly arch inserts, and much, much more!<br>By your junior year, you will have declared a major. You might learn to operate class "c" vehicles such as cars and light trucks. Or you could decide to master the art of docking with American Destroyers on an inflatable boat. If you're an advanced student, you might even get to study at the post-graduate level, trying to harvest the Ebola virus from bloody, dying monkeys with your bare hands!<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">FACULTY</span></strong><br>School Osama bin Laden is the most universally recognized figure in world terror today. He has successfully brought down the Soviet Empire due to his acclaimed in Afghanistan, and now is continuing his work against the great Satan, America. With a $25 million dollar bounty on his head, Professor bin Laden must be doing something right!<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>TRAVEL OPPORTUNITIES &amp; RECOGNITION</strong></span><br><span class="small"><span style="font-style: italic;">Recent graduate work in New York received worldwide attention</span></span><br><br>Recent graduates have gone to such exotic locales as Kashmir, Chechnya, Tel Aviv and even New York City! What better way to see the world than on a holy mission to destroy it?<br><br>"I used to just sit around and hate Americans. Now, I get the great personal satisfaction of doing something about it."<span style="font-style: italic;">Junior, Majoring in Car Bombing</span><br><br>"I like the idea of going straight to paradise and all I have to do is get gunned down while killing Americans. Do the math. It's a no-brainer!"<span style="font-style: italic;">Senior, Weapons Major</span><br><br>"I used to think making the streets run red with blood was just hyperbole. Now, I know that with a whole lot of elbow grease, and just a little bit of emtex in a truck, it can definitely be done!"<span style="font-style: italic;">Junior, Chemistry Major</span><br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">SOCIAL LIFE</span></strong><br>Of course, OBLU is not just a "terror factory." From volleyball to tetherball, students enjoy a variety of social and enrichment events outside of their daily Jihad duties. Many of the friendships made at school are strong enough to last for all eternity in the hall of martyrs!<br><br>OBLU students also enjoy these perks:<br>Graduates receive no-money down loan for all truck or boat purchases<br>50% discount on all weapons purchases made at the student store<br>Free parking<br><br>Apply today for Osama bin Laden University.
