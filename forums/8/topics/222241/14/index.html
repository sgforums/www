            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Hamiltonian1125:</div><div class="quote_body">Haiiiii...it is really difficult to prove the existance of God. This prove is not like any math proof. The reason math is so powerful because it is build on basic axioms and statements that are universally true, hence any proof in math is simply using these axioms or other theorems( which is also based on the axioms) to proof whether a statement is mathematically correct or wrong.<br>There is no fundamentally correct "axioms" to prove God do not exist nor to prove it exist. Sad to say, physicists dun even understand 95 % of the universe much less to say proving the existance of God. Even the well established theory of relativity hav difficulties in merging wif battle tested quantum mech...the diff lies in the main argument of relativity is that space and time are entangled with intimate relationship whereas in quantum mech, using variable seperable in partial diff eqn for schroodinger eqn SEPARATE time and space forming time INDEPT  SE. Physicists hav lots of problems to solve rather than arguing senselessly the existence of God. Atheists out there, dun be overconfident...<br>Personally, I do believe in God but I dont believe in Christ, Allah and such. If there is no God, then who the heck in hell creates fundamental building particles like leptons(quarks, gluons etc). Of course, we should not account every strange phenomena to the doing of God and hence beyond our comprehension.If everyone is so superstitious, then the world will not improve and what God created are just a bunch of foolishly pious human. God give us a brain and this INDICATE God LOVES ppl who use their brains to tink and wanted us to discover nature by ourself, not thru bible, quran, old testament,buddhist scripture etc. I believe God lives in our heart and i believe God isnt that narcicisitic to such extent to condemn those who do not believe Him to hell( u noe what religionS i am refering to). There should be no restriction when we are doing scientific works. Dun ever say God do not want us to noe this or that. Cmon, God give us a brain to think and analyse, so use it for goodness sake.<br>As for theory of evolution, forgive me for my impudence and ignorance, I tink atheists should not use it as a proof for the nonexistance of God. It is still a theory and hence may be replaced. Quantum mech is a master piece of physicists, but physicists would still discard this beauty if there is a better theory that is more consistent and more reproducable in experiments. Who noes years later theory of evolution is being replaced by a better model. The true beauty of science lies in the ability to "upgrade" and a change for a better and more consistent understanding of our universe. Thus it is pretty narcicisitic for ppl to firmly believe that theory of evolution is definitely correct. In this case, isnt ur "faith" in theory of evolution akin to those blind followers of their respective religions???? Last but not least, physics is a "bible" that give the best explaination of our universe so far, not some lame scripture from all the world religions.</div></blockquote>I would reaed this if you had put some paragraphings and lessen your number of words.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here's something for fellow Atheists to consider <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Even though as a Buddhist the word 'God' is not in our dictionary, but this article does has its points.<br><br><a href="http://www.kenwilber.com/blog/show/191" rel="nofollow">http://www.kenwilber.com/blog/show/191</a><br><br>Journal<br><strong>The New Atheism is as Flat as a Pancake</strong><br>November 13, 2006 21:00<br><br>(posted by ~C4Chaos)<br><br>I just finished reading the recent <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.11/atheism.html" rel="nofollow">WIRED feature on The New Atheism</a>. The trinity of active  mainstream atheists (Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Daniel Dennett) are at it again evangelizing the gospel of the God-less society.<br><br>For the most part, I agree with them. Belief in God is not required and it's the cause of so much suffering around the world via religious extremisms. However, their approach is too fundamentalistic for my taste. While I personally don't limit the idea of God to its Christian or Muslim or Jewish concept, I also don't think that logic and rationalism alone could ever take the place of faith and religion. It's like saying that integral calculus can be taught to students without them learning basic algebra.<br><br>The biggest flaw of the New Atheists is that, their ideas, no matter how rational, <a href="http://stuartdavis.com/node/1127" rel="nofollow">are FLAT</a>. They are too focused attacking the the idea of God without defining <a href="http://www.beliefnet.com/story/153/story_15318_1.html" rel="nofollow">which level of God</a> they're attacking. I say that they're pretty much attacking the <a href="http://www.beliefnet.com/story/153/story_15318_1.html" rel="nofollow">mythic God</a>. However, they're making a lot of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performative_contradiction" rel="nofollow">performative contradictions</a> and thus elevate their own level of God in the process: the <a href="http://www.beliefnet.com/story/153/story_15318_1.html" rel="nofollow">mental God</a> (read: logic, rational).<br><br>But if there's one good thing that the New Atheists are doing, it's that they're elevating the psychological development of people who are ready to step out of mythic belief in God. I just hope that these people don't get stuck in rational level because there are other higher levels of God that can only be understood and appreciated once we take a skinny dip into the trans-rational.<br><br>Kudos to the <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.11/atheism.html" rel="nofollow">WIRED article</a> for not buying into the atheistic Kool Aid <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"The New Atheists have castigated fundamentalism and branded even the mildest religious liberals as enablers of a vengeful mob. Everybody who does not join them is an ally of the Taliban. But, so far, their provocation has failed to take hold. Given all the religious trauma in the world, I take this as good news. Even those of us who sympathize intellectually have good reasons to wish that the New Atheists continue to seem absurd. If we reject their polemics, if we continue to have respectful conversations even about things we find ridiculous, this doesn't necessarily mean we've lost our convictions or our sanity. It simply reflects our deepest, democratic values. Or, you might say, our bedrock faith: the faith that no matter how confident we are in our beliefs, there's always a chance we could turn out to be wrong."</span><br><br>(Note: For more details on levels of God and a more-embracing spirituality, check out the book <a href="http://isc.integralinstitute.org/public/about/ISCNewStayInformed.aspx" rel="nofollow">Integral Spirituality</a>, and the <a href="http://isc.integralinstitute.org/Public/static/Default.aspx" rel="nofollow">ISC portal</a>).</div>

The shouting matches have long begun.<br><br></div></blockquote>His philosophy is quite wide naturally since it is an integral viewpoint. But I can ascertain you that from my experience and my friend's experience and many others' experience that there is indeed a higher reality and that it is similar to what Ken Wilber has mapped.<br><br>And transrational is not prerational, it's quite different. So there is no doubt and confusion over what is prerational and transrational for one with the sort of experiences. It is not a personal opinion - because of the different levels of holons and I think I won't elaborate here - you have to read his book and you will understand how it is not so.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Anyway his book is truly worth reading and considering, of course any philosophy that is as wide as his will attract many critics of different schools of thought. But if we can experience ourself intuitively we will know it to be true.</div>

Because there's nothing to answer, it's all in my first post. And this post of yours only confirms that you've been misreading me all the while.
