Of course direct imaging of a virus is only possible in more modern times (Electron microscope ~1950s) but scientists and doctors have been aware of the characteristics and effects of viruses for many years.<br><br>The advent of modern imaging doesn't "prove" viruses immediately.

Critics, especially the clergy, claimed it was repulsive and ungodly to inoculate someone with material from a diseased animal. A satirical cartoon of 1802 showed people who had been vaccinated sprouting cow's heads. However the obvious advantages of vaccination and the protection it provided won out, and vaccination soon became widespread.</blockquote>Reproducible and systematic effects rule  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkblue;">This was originally printed in The American Rationalist, Volume 17, Number 3, September/October 1962.  How ironic that it should apply even today :</span><br><br>"The indestructible foundation of the whole edifice of Atheism is its philosophy, materialism, or naturalism, as it is also known. That philosophy regards the world as it actually is, views it in the light of the data provided by progressive science and social experience. <strong>Atheistic materialism is the logical outcome of scientific knowledge gained over the centuries.</strong><br><br>We make a fundamental error, I think, as we tilt at the windmills of imagined gods. We need to review from where we have come, under what conditions, and to see the threshold upon which we stand now.<br><br><strong>Our history has been marked by a ceaseless struggle against ignorance and superstition.</strong> In ancient Greece the works of the materialist philosopher Democritus, who first taught the atomic theory of matter, were destroyed. Anaxagoras was banished from Athens for being an Atheist. The materialist philosopher Epicurus, revered by the ancients for having liberated man from fear of gods and for asserting the validity of science, was for 2000 years anathematized and falsely depicted as an enemy of morality and a disseminator of vice. The Alexandria library, housing 700,000 scientific and literary works, was burned by Christian monks in 391 AD. Pope Gregory I (590-604) destroyed many valuable works by ancient authors. In every society there have been forces that have stood to lose by the dissemination of progressive scientific views. In the past these forces either directly persecuted progressive scientists and philosophers or sought to distort scientific discoveries so as to deprive them of their progressive, materialistic implications.<br><br>The Inquisition, a papal invention for suppressing all opposition to the Catholic Church, savagely persecuted all progressive thinkers; Giordano Bruno, Ludilio Vanini, and Galileo come readily to mind.<br><br>Voltaire was imprisoned in the Bastille, and Diderot was sent to prison. In our own country we are familiar with the story of Thomas Paine, of the Salem witch trials, of Ingersoll, of Einstein. The struggle is unceasing, as important today as during any other period of history.<br><br><strong>We need, therefore, to see what we fight and why. We need not direct our main assault against the Bible or the Koran. We need not argue endlessly about the historicity of Jesus. We should look past trinities and angels and other theological blind alleys. We must look to materialistic philosophy which alone enables men to understand reality and to know how to deal with it. </strong>It is true that today our kind are no longer burned at the stake, but there are many other ways of exerting pressure. Our scientists and progressive philosophers are dismissed from universities and other employment. Outspoken scientific and philosophical works are much less likely to be published than rather senseless junk. Character assassination is common. Reactionary religious propaganda is unceasingly drummed into unthinking minds through the captive media of mass communication. As always, our opponents today are formidable. But our strength lies in the positive approach of uncovering and publicizing the laws of nature and human behavior, and in applying these laws in the interest of human welfare. We need not waste our time with endless arguments about tortuous paths of the endless labyrinths of theology.<br><br>We need to know upon what we base ourselves. <strong>Atheism is based upon a materialist philosophy, which holds that nothing exists but natural phenomena. There are no supernatural forces or entities, nor can there be any. Nature simply exists. </strong>" - <a href="http://www.atheists.org/Atheism/atheism.html" rel="nofollow"> Madalyn Murray OÂ’Hair</a>, Founder of American Atheists<br><br>Click <a href="http://www.atheists.org/Atheism/atheism.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> to read the full text</div>

No point keep saying this and that and this and that... It slike I can say exactly the following...<br><br>After all evolution is still a theory.... carbon dating losses its validity in fact after more than 3000 years.  There are evidence that shows carbon dating could have mistakes too... where things beneath soil are seems newer than things above soil...<br><br>But seriously... you are pushing everything aside simply by telling everyone go read the science magazine etc... and expect no one actually go do that and come back proving you wrong right? Why not do everyone a favour and prove your claims... Seriously from your first threads till now you had been telling me to go read this and tat... but you stated nothing substatial... haven't quote a thing from the Magazine etc....<br><br>check this <a href="http://drdino.com/articles.php?spec=67" rel="nofollow">http://drdino.com/articles.php?spec=67</a> If you got the prove why not be $250,000 richer?<br><br>Everything thinks evolution is the only theory... in fact there was quite a few theories existed.... ( including alien theory unfortunately) but why evolution  seems more accepted is becoz it sounds more logical ONLY explain things that happened... even the history of homosapian was debated and changed as new proofs are shown... There are still NO testable data that shows evolution works... Please don't mislead anyone here thank you. Where exactly is life form on earth? Nothign found yet... scientist yet to find... maybe only your so called fossil... Frankly Evolutionist can say all they want but if you look at all the facts... its as hard to believe as others... IMO religion seems easier to believe.<br><br>There is no twisting of facts for both creationist... how can facts be twisted in the first place? Everyone look at a coin in its own perspective....

It is the reason why u can type this out in a forum on the internet. There are disputes because people are trying to refine it to make it better. Evolution is accepted because we share genes with many animals, namely the primates family, and mouse etc. This is one of the prove.</div>
