            <div class='col-md body'>You want answers. Here you go:<br><br>Evolution can be divided into two parts, macro and micro.  Micro evolution is a fact, where as macro evolution remains a theory due to debates on the exact steps of the evolutionary process.  EVOLUTION DID HAPPEN we simply canÂ’t trace the exact evolutionary steps of the of the 3 trillion plus species on earth.  Considering there is no way that we can even prove if we have located all the species on earth, this may always remain a theory.  We can prove though, beyond a doubt, that humans have evolved.  We can trace it back conclusively 3.6 million years.  97% of all scientists accept evolution (so does the Catholic Church).   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
