Perhaps Prof Brian Ridley(physicist at University of Essex)'s book 'On Science' may elucidate the flaws of science more clearly  </blockquote>You are right that the "hows" of gravity has been tackled first, and rightly so that experimental results can validate Newton's Universal Gravitation where gravity is treated as a "force".<br><br>Of course, there are other natural philosophers at that time was not satisfied with this explanation, but there was no better framework to explain it until Einstein's General Relativity, where gravity became the curvature of space-time due to mass.<br><br>"Whats" and "Whys" in general enter the realm of philosophy rather than science, and carry the potential pitfall of the anthropic principle (which argues that everything in the Universe was tailor-made for us). Scientific background can be used for speculations, but without data, their speculations are as shaky as any, including religious ones.<br><br><blockquote>we can draw a parallel between this incident and all the debate on bioethics that only came about of late. in both cases we are unsure of the eventual long-term consequences of the application of the latest radical scientific procedures despite all the extensive scientific research. so people tend to use religion to judge the validity and feasibility of such radical ideas and hence giving u the notion that religion is sort of like impeding the progress of science. But have you wondered what if there are no safeguards that keeps scientific progress in check? yes scientific progress, such as research in the field of life sciences, will definitely be more rapid but at what expense? </blockquote>You are correct to observe that the ethical standards used for evaluating bioethics are usually decided by society. Moral philosophers would prefer that they be consulted for such things because they are more consistent, but government usually used guidelines from the general population which will inevitably include religious moral values. Where the various religions have a consensus this is usually ok, but what if the various faiths are not in agreement?<br><br><blockquote>Do u know that the boundaries between the human realm and beast is getting blurred at a frightening speed in today's world?There's this Newsweek article...dunno whether can find online not...by Professor Lee M Silver of Princeton's Department of Molecular Biology that reported the creation of human-animal chimeras by biologists.Think of all the moral conundrums that are brought about by such scientific experiments.And you also heard about beastiality right? Would god-fearing people do such things? Maybe yes but the tendency for a scientist with religious considerations to do so will be much less than a scientist bent on achieving breakthroughs( not the bestiality part lar   ) </blockquote>You are assuming that everything that "god-fearing" people do are necessarily moral. Not every "god-fearing" person shares common ethical systems or apply them consistently.<br><br><blockquote>So what i'm trying to say is that religion serves as a good and stable anchor for humans while keeping scientific progress in check instead of hindering it.</blockquote>In so far that religion provides the social conventions it will serve this need for an anchor. Where social conventions are derived from other sources (such as cultural and historical), it will not.<br><br><blockquote>Just to sidetrack a little, dun you think that that Edward Jenner guy is like taking potshots in the dark and hoping to strike lottery?I know that his revolutionary idea saved many lives but WHAT IF a new and more lethal hybrid of viral disease may just be created all thanks to him and his experiments?? How can he be that damn sure that such a possibility wont occur?  </blockquote>You are right that Jenner and some others (such the scientist who discovered Helicobacter pylori) are willing to apply their hunch in a more heroic way than other scientists. Despite his confidence in this technology he has to convince people that it works, so he used a fairly risky approach. Today clinical trials involving people are far more carefully decided, carried out and monitored. Please understand that all experiments have to pass through ethics approval.<br><br>Also, in science nobody can be damned sure about anything. Some theories can produce experimental predictions 99.99% accurate to the actual result, but that is still not 100%. Scientists are aware of the limitations of not having enough support. What I personally don't understand is how can anyone have unwavering belief in things that have little or no support.</div>

Gravity you can simply test by throwing a ball into the air and see it fall... Evolution? Show me </strong><br><br>Off the top of my head here are some testable predictions where experimental results are in favour of biological evolution:<br><br>1. Viruses and bacteria can mutate to more virulent strains or jump host species. HIV, SARS CoV, H5N1, just to name a few.<br><br><strong>Viruses and bacteria are very simple organism... You are simply comparing to it and do you know how big and sophiscated you are to it?  Mutation is not evolution... A system that is irreducibly complex has precise components working together to perform the basic function of the system. (A mousetrap is a simple example.) If any part of that system were missing, the system would cease to function. Gradual additions could not account for the origin of such a system. It would have to come together fully formed and integrated. Many living systems exhibit this (vision, blood-clotting, etc.). When you look at a watch, you assume there was a watchmaker. A watch is too complex to "happen" by chance. Yet such living systems are almost infinitely more complex than a watch. They could not be randomÂ—they simply had to be designed and created. You don't expect a bacteria to grow another arms in a year simply you see there is such a need. I think you imagine you'll grow another arms for the next 100,000 years you'll also not grow another arms.<br><br>Mutations which increase genetic information would be the raw material necessary for evolution. To get from "amoeba" to "man" would require a massive net increase in information. There are many examples of supposed evolution given by proponents. Variation within a species (finch beak, for example), bacteria which acquire antibiotic resistance, people born with an extra chromosome, etc. However, none of the examples demonstrate the development of new information. Instead, they demonstrate either preprogrammed variation, multiple copies of existing information, or even loss of information (natural selection and adaptation involve loss of information). The total lack of any such evidence refutes evolutionary theory.<br></strong><br><br>2.

We should be surrounded by a zoo of transitional forms that cannot be categorized as one particular life form. But we don't see thisÂ—there are different kinds of dogs, but all are clearly dogs. The fossils show different sizes of horses, but all are clearly horses. None is on the verge of being some other life form. The fossil record shows complex fossilized life suddenly appearing, and there are major gaps between the fossilized "kinds." Darwin acknowledged that if his theory were true, it would require millions of transitional forms. He believed they would be found in fossil records. They haven't been.<br><br>Pasteur proved that life only comes from lifeÂ—this is the law of biogenesis. The next semester we studied evolution, where we learned that the first living cell came from a freak combination of nonliving material (where that nonliving material came from we were not told). "Chemical Evolution" is just another way of saying "spontaneous generation"Â—life comes from nonlife. Evolution is therefore built on a fallacy science long ago proved to be impossible.<br><br>Evolutionists admit that the chances of evolutionary progress are extremely low. Yet, they believe that given enough time, the apparently impossible becomes possible. If I flip a coin, I have a 50/50 chance of getting heads. To get five "heads" in a row is unlikely but possible. If I flipped the coin long enough, I would eventually get five in a row. If I flipped it for years nonstop, I might get 50 or even 100 in a row. But this is only because getting heads is an inherent possibility. What are the chances of me flipping a coin, and then seeing it sprout arms and legs, and go sit in a corner and read a magazine? No chance. Given billions of years, the chances would never increase. Great periods of time make the possible likely but never make the impossible possible. No matter how long it's given, non-life will not become alive.<br><br>Micro-evolution, changes within a species on a small scale, is observable. But evidence for macro-evolution, changes transcending species, is conspicuous by its absence. To prove the possibility of anything, science must be able to reproduce exact original conditions. Even when it proves something is possible, it doesn't mean it therefore happened. Since no man was there to record or even witness the beginning, conclusions must be made only on the basis of interpreting presently available information. If I put on rose-colored glasses, I will always see red. I accept the Bible's teaching on creation, and see the evidence as being consistently supportive of that belief. When dealing with origins, everyone who believes anything does so by faith, whether faith in God, the Bible, himself, modern science, or the dependability of his own subjective interpretations of existing data. I would rather put my faith in God.<br><br>Seriously I don't know where you learn your science, but even evolutionist daren't say they could test evolution and you could....<br></strong><br><br></div>

A system that is irreducibly complex has precise components working together to perform the basic function of the system. (A mousetrap is a simple example.) If any part of that system were missing, the system would cease to function. Gradual additions could not account for the origin of such a system. It would have to come together fully formed and integrated. Many living systems exhibit this (vision, blood-clotting, etc.). When you look at a watch, you assume there was a watchmaker. A watch is too complex to "happen" by chance. Yet such living systems are almost infinitely more complex than a watch. They could not be randomÂ—they simply had to be designed and created. You don't expect a bacteria to grow another arms in a year simply you see there is such a need. I think you imagine you'll grow another arms for the next 100,000 years you'll also not grow another arms.<br><br>Mutations which increase genetic information would be the raw material necessary for evolution. To get from "amoeba" to "man" would require a massive net increase in information. There are many examples of supposed evolution given by proponents. Variation within a species (finch beak, for example), bacteria which acquire antibiotic resistance, people born with an extra chromosome, etc. However, none of the examples demonstrate the development of new information. Instead, they demonstrate either preprogrammed variation, multiple copies of existing information, or even loss of information (natural selection and adaptation involve loss of information). The total lack of any such evidence refutes evolutionary theory.<br><br>Evolution does not require a single missing link, but innumerable ones. We should be surrounded by a zoo of transitional forms that cannot be categorized as one particular life form. But we don't see thisÂ—there are different kinds of dogs, but all are clearly dogs. The fossils show different sizes of horses, but all are clearly horses. None is on the verge of being some other life form. The fossil record shows complex fossilized life suddenly appearing, and there are major gaps between the fossilized "kinds." Darwin acknowledged that if his theory were true, it would require millions of transitional forms. He believed they would be found in fossil records. They haven't been.<br><br>Pasteur proved that life only comes from lifeÂ—this is the law of biogenesis. The next semester we studied evolution, where we learned that the first living cell came from a freak combination of nonliving material (where that nonliving material came from we were not told). "Chemical Evolution" is just another way of saying "spontaneous generation"Â—life comes from nonlife. Evolution is therefore built on a fallacy science long ago proved to be impossible.<br><br>Evolutionists admit that the chances of evolutionary progress are extremely low. Yet, they believe that given enough time, the apparently impossible becomes possible. If I flip a coin, I have a 50/50 chance of getting heads. To get five "heads" in a row is unlikely but possible. If I flipped the coin long enough, I would eventually get five in a row. If I flipped it for years nonstop, I might get 50 or even 100 in a row. But this is only because getting heads is an inherent possibility. What are the chances of me flipping a coin, and then seeing it sprout arms and legs, and go sit in a corner and read a magazine? No chance. Given billions of years, the chances would never increase. Great periods of time make the possible likely but never make the impossible possible. No matter how long it's given, non-life will not become alive.<br><br>Micro-evolution, changes within a species on a small scale, is observable. But evidence for macro-evolution, changes transcending species, is conspicuous by its absence. To prove the possibility of anything, science must be able to reproduce exact original conditions. Even when it proves something is possible, it doesn't mean it therefore happened. Since no man was there to record or even witness the beginning, conclusions must be made only on the basis of interpreting presently available information. If I put on rose-colored glasses, I will always see red. I accept the Bible's teaching on creation, and see the evidence as being consistently supportive of that belief. When dealing with origins, everyone who believes anything does so by faith, whether faith in God, the Bible, himself, modern science, or the dependability of his own subjective interpretations of existing data. I would rather put my faith in God.<br><br>Seriously I don't know where you learn your science, but even evolutionist daren't say they could test evolution and you could....</blockquote>Suddenly your English becomes so fluent, and I realize you are just cut-and-pasting without quoting the source.<br></div>
