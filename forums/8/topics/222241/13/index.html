It's a different thing altogether to be aggressive against a person or a group of persons just because of ideology.

            <div class='col-md body'>Haiiiii...it is really difficult to prove the existance of God. This prove is not like any math proof. The reason math is so powerful because it is build on basic axioms and statements that are universally true, hence any proof in math is simply using these axioms or other theorems( which is also based on the axioms) to proof whether a statement is mathematically correct or wrong.<br>There is no fundamentally correct "axioms" to prove God do not exist nor to prove it exist. Sad to say, physicists dun even understand 95 % of the universe much less to say proving the existance of God. Even the well established theory of relativity hav difficulties in merging wif battle tested quantum mech...the diff lies in the main argument of relativity is that space and time are entangled with intimate relationship whereas in quantum mech, using variable seperable in partial diff eqn for schroodinger eqn SEPARATE time and space forming time INDEPT  SE. Physicists hav lots of problems to solve rather than arguing senselessly the existence of God. Atheists out there, dun be overconfident...<br>Personally, I do believe in God but I dont believe in Christ, Allah and such. If there is no God, then who the heck in hell creates fundamental building particles like leptons(quarks, gluons etc). Of course, we should not account every strange phenomena to the doing of God and hence beyond our comprehension.If everyone is so superstitious, then the world will not improve and what God created are just a bunch of foolishly pious human. God give us a brain and this INDICATE God LOVES ppl who use their brains to tink and wanted us to discover nature by ourself, not thru bible, quran, old testament,buddhist scripture etc. I believe God lives in our heart and i believe God isnt that narcicisitic to such extent to condemn those who do not believe Him to hell( u noe what religionS i am refering to). There should be no restriction when we are doing scientific works. Dun ever say God do not want us to noe this or that. Cmon, God give us a brain to think and analyse, so use it for goodness sake.<br>As for theory of evolution, forgive me for my impudence and ignorance, I tink atheists should not use it as a proof for the nonexistance of God. It is still a theory and hence may be replaced. Quantum mech is a master piece of physicists, but physicists would still discard this beauty if there is a better theory that is more consistent and more reproducable in experiments. Who noes years later theory of evolution is being replaced by a better model. The true beauty of science lies in the ability to "upgrade" and a change for a better and more consistent understanding of our universe. Thus it is pretty narcicisitic for ppl to firmly believe that theory of evolution is definitely correct. In this case, isnt ur "faith" in theory of evolution akin to those blind followers of their respective religions???? Last but not least, physics is a "bible" that give the best explaination of our universe so far, not some lame scripture from all the world religions.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Being an atheist who doesn't believe in religion or spirituality doesn't have to mean you're anti-religion.
