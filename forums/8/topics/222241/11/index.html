            <div class='col-md body'>Evolutionary theory is the framework tying together all of biology. It explains similarities and differences between organisms, fossils, biogeography, drug resistance, extreme features such as the peacock's tail, relative virulence of parasites, and much more besides. This explanatory framework is useful in a practical sense. First, a unified theory is easier to learn, because the facts connect together rather than being so many isolated bits of trivia. Second, having a theory makes it possible to see gaps in the theory, suggesting productive areas for new research.<br><br>Practical aspects of evolution include:<br><br>Bioinformatics, a multi-billion-dollar industry, consists largely of the comparison of genetic sequences. Descent with modification is one of its most basic assumptions.<br><br>Diseases and pests evolve resistance to the drugs and pesticides we use against them. Evolutionary theory is used in the field of resistance management in both medicine and agriculture.<br><br>Evolutionary theory is used to manage fisheries for greater yields.<br><br>Knowledge of the evolution of parasite virulence in human populations can help guide public health policy.<br><br>Evolutionary theory is being applied to and has potential applications in many other areas, from evaluating the threats of genetically modified crops to human psychology.<br><br>Phylogenetic analysis, which uses the evolutionary principle of common descent, has proven its usefulness by tracing genes of known function and comparing how they are related to unknown genes helps one to predict unknown gene function, which is foundational for drug discovery.<br><br>Phylogenetic analysis is a standard part of epidemiology, since it allows the identification of disease reservoirs and sometimes the tracking of step-by-step transmission of disease.<br><br>Phylogenetic analysis to track the diversity of a pathogen can be used to select an appropriate vaccine for a particular region.<br><br>Directed evolution allows the "breeding" of molecules or molecular pathways to create or enhance products, including enzymes, pigments, antibiotics, flavors, biopolymers and<br>bacterial strains to decompose hazardous materials.<br><br>Directed evolution can also be used to study the folding and function of natural enzymes.<br>The evolutionary principles of natural selection, variation, and recombination are the basis for genetic algorithms, an engineering technique that has many practical applications, including aerospace engineering, architecture, astrophysics, data mining, drug discovery and design, electrical engineering, finance, geophysics, materials engineering, military strategy, pattern recognition, robotics, scheduling, and systems engineering.<br><br>Tools developed for evolutionary science have been put to other uses. For example:<br>Many statistical techniques, including analysis of variance and linear regression, were developed by evolutionary biologists, especially Ronald Fisher and Karl Pearson. These statistical techniques have much wider application today.  The same techniques of phylogenetic analysis developed for biology can also trace the history of multiple copies of a manuscript and the history of languages.<br><br>RELIGIOUS FUNDAMENTALISTS WHO REJECT EVOLUTION SHOULD ALSO REJECT MANY OF THE SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES, TECHNOLOGICAL CONVENIENCES AND MEDICAL CARE OF MODERN SOCIETY.......ONE WHO REJECTS EVOLUTION BUT STILL USES ANTIBIOTICS OR MANY OTHER HEALTHCARE PRODUCTS IS BASICALLY A <strong>HYPOCRITE</strong>!<br><br></div>

There is room for only one king in this corner of the world."<br><br>The number of religious leaders who believed a messiah had been born in Bethlehem. Zero.<br><br>The type of people who did. Some stargazers, night-shift sheperds, and a couple of newlyweds who claimed to have more expereience giving birth than having sex.<br><br>The reward given to Joseph and Mary for bringing God into the world. Two years in exile, learning Egyptian.<br><br>This was the beginning of the Christian movement. (And these were the calm years.)<br><br>His Ministry<br><br>The word on the streets of Jesus' hometown when he claimed to be sent from God. Wierd family. Have you seen his cousin?<br><br>The reaction of the hometown folks. Stone him.<br><br>The opinion of his brothers. Lock him up.<br><br>The number of disciples Jesus recruited. Seventy.<br><br>The number of disciples who defended him to the authorities. Zero.<br><br>The assessment of Jesus' followers as found in the Jerusalem editorial page. A group of unemployed ne'er-do-wells recruited off the shipping docks and out of the red-light districts.<br><br>The numbers of lepers and blind and lame people Jesus healed. Too many to count.<br><br>The number of healed lepers and blind and lame people who defended Jesus on the day of his death. Zero.<br><br>His Execution<br><br>The popular opinion regarding Jesus before he cleansed the Temple. See if he'll run for office.<br><br>The popular opinion regarding Jesus after he cleansed the Temple. Let's see how fast he can run.<br><br>The decision of the Jewish council. Three spikes and a spear.<br><br>The talk on the streets of Jerusalem after Jesus died. He should've stayed in the furniture business.<br><br>The number of times Jesus prophesied that he would come back to life three days after his death. Three.<br><br>The number of apostles who heard the prophecy. All of them.<br><br>The number of apostles who waited at the tomb to see if he would do what he said. Zero.<br><br>The number of his followers who belierved in the resurrection before it occurred. You do the math.<br><br>The odds a street-corner bookie would've given the day after the crucifixion on the possibility that Jesus' name would be known in the year 2000. "I'll give you better odds that he'll rise from the dead."<br><br>His Movement<br><br>The official response of the Jewish leaders to the rumors of the resurrection. Of course they say he's alive. They have to. What else can they say?<br><br>The actual response of the Jewish leaders to the resurrection of Jesus. "A great number of the Jewish priests believed and obeyed" (Acts 6:7)<br><br>The decision of the Jewish leaders about the church. "If their plan comes from human authority, it will fail. But if it is from God, you will not be able to stop them" (Acts 5:38-39)<br><br>The response of the church. "The number of followers was growing" (Acts 6:1)<br><br>The official response of the Jewish leaders to the conversion of Saul. Good riddance to the former Pharisee. Won't be months before he is in jail, and then what will he do? Write letters?<br><br>What Saul, turned Paul, understood that his former colleagues didn't. "God gave [Jesus] as a way to forgive sin" (Rom 3:25)<br><br>The Movement Continues<br><br>The belief of French philosopher Voltaire. The bible and Christianity would pass within a hundred years. He died in 1778. The movement continues.<br><br>The pronouncement of Friedrich Nietzsche in 1882. "God is dead." The dawn of science, he believed, would be the doom of faith. Science has dawned; the movement continues.<br><br>The way a Communist dictionary defined the Bible. "It is a collection of fantastic legends without any scientific support." Communism is diminishing; the movement continues.<br><br>The discovery made by every person who has tried to bury the faith. The same as the one made by those who tried to bury its Founder; He won't stay in the tomb.<br><br>The facts. The movement has never been stronger. Over one billion Catholics and nearly as many Protestants.<br><br>The question. How do we explain it? Jesus was a backwater peasant. He never wrote a book, never held an office. He never journeyed more than two hundred miles from his hometown. Friends left him. One betrayed him. Those he helped forgot him. Prior to his death, they abandoned him. But after his death they couldn't resist him. What made the difference?<br><br>The answer. His death and resurrection.<br><br>For when he died, so did your sin.<br><br>And when he rose, so did your hope.<br><br>For when he rose, your grave was changed from a final residence to temporary housing.<br><br>The reason he did it. The face in your mirror.<br><br>The verdict after two millenniums. Herod was right; there is room for only one King.[/b]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by banzie:</div><div class="quote_body">Does it matter? The point here isn't it about getting knowledge from your sources to prove who is right? So where is your points from your science magazines?</div></blockquote>As I mentioned earlier, we are talking about science, so I hope that you are getting your scientific information from reputable sources. So quoting your source will help convince me and other readers that you have credible data.<br><br>In addition, I am working hard to debate with you personally, so it's laziness on your part to paste other people's argument wholesale without even analyzing them.<br><br>Ibram Gaunt has already written well on the importance of evolutionary biology to science (see above).<br><br>I know you will not be convinced by whatever evidence I present here, but for the benefit of other readers I shall try to address your (actually other people's) criticisms.<br><br>1. Evolution is untestable? False.<br><br>J B Haldane once said that if you can find rabbit fossils in the Precambrian, it will help refute evolution. None have been found.<br><br>In addition to fossil evidence, modern genetics experiments also overwhelmingly support evolution. I have already mentioned experiments on flies, butterflies and chick that test evolutionary theory. Other models include zebrafish and mouse.<br><br>2. Irreducible complexity is pure bunk. Paley's brass watch and Behe's mousetrap are both terrible analogies of living systems. I have written a criticism of their analogies in this article.<br><br><a href="http://freshbrainz.blogspot.com/2006/10/irreducible-complexity-pwned.html" rel="nofollow">http://freshbrainz.blogspot.com/2006/10/irreducible-complexity-pwned.html</a><br><br>3. The "increase in information" angle comes from Bill Dembski. In reality, new information enters genomes all the time. I have already mentioned polyploidy in plants. In addition to whole genome multiplications there are additional chromosomes, gene multiplications, lengthened genes, truncated genes, modified genes...many modes of increasing information.<br><br>4. Fossilization of organisms is rare, so it is unreasonable to expect all the transitory forms to be recorded in fossils. Palaeontologists can find dozens of transitory fossils per genus, but creationists are never satisfied. Do you know why?<br><br>If they can find one million transitory fossils, creationists will demand 2 million. If they can find 2 million, creationists will want 4 million. Where scientists build evidence, creationists always see gaps.<br><br>5. Abiogenesis is not part of evolutionary biology, and personally I think it is not as strongly supported as evolution. Still I should remind you that the definition of life (as an emergent trait) has always been controversial.<br><br>People (vitalists) once considered sub-cellular components such as "organic" chemicals (eg. urea) as alive. Today we can synthesize them chemically, so we don't consider them alive.<br><br>Since cells are made of non-living parts, how can cells be alive? We just accept this. So if it is easy to imagine life emerging from non-life spatially, we can also imagine life emerging from non-life in time.<br><br>Anyway even if life has always existed, it would not support special creation. In fact it would refute creationism, since life has always existed it would by definition not require any sort of creator.<br><br>6. Biological evolution is a non-random process, because it acts via natural selection. Also, since genes have organization, sequence changes can produce predictable effects.<br><br>Also, very low probability events are inevitable at evolutionary (geological) time scales.<br><br>As for that extra arm you were waiting for... someone someday will eventually sprout an extra arm.<br><br><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=2021142&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=2021142&amp;page=1</a><br><br>7. "Microevolution" is just the creationist excuse to have their cake and eat it too. They know that bacteria and viruses mutate rapidly and display wildly different characteristics such as virulent, host jumping and multidrug resistance. So they say that microevolution can only occur below the species level.<br><br>But here's the trick: they don't accept the scientific definition of species (reproductive isolation) and use their own definition called "kinds". So no matter how much the descendant populations diverge they are still the same kind.<br><br>Using this word game no organism can ever evolve beyond the "kind" level! Monkeys evolving into other monkey species are still monkeys - only microevolution!<br><br>In reality there is no such barrier to evolution. Every speciation step is of course at the species level, but it does not magically stop at that level. Life continued to evolve until we have the full biodiversity we see today.<br><br>8. You say that since no human was around to record exactly what happened during the inception of life, everyone is only guessing and the origins must be taken on faith.<br><br>If all criminal investigators believe that, then murderers will never be convicted, because many murders occur without anyone else around. Also the data is usually incomplete. Even if caught on camera, video cameras have a 1/20 second gap between frames.<br><br>Yet the bloody shoe prints, knife in the sink with suspect's fingerprints and victim's blood, absence from usual routine during time of crime... various evidence using different approaches, demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt that the suspect is guilty.<br><br>Faith is not used to determine the truth here.<br><br>So why do you insist on using faith to refute something which already has so much supporting evidence???</div>
