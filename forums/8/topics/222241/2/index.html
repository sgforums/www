Everytime scientists produce a transitory fossil, creationists claim two more new "gaps". There are no real loop holes, just intellectual dishonesty by creationists.

If you believe in gravity and not in evolution, you are a hypocrite.<br><br>"creationist are scientist too/they never disagree with science" - they have no peer review publication in science. In fact they don't even have a testable hypothesis. Their strategy is to poke holes in modern science and gloat whenever people cannot explain everything.

That is, one scientist may get results that another scientist can't get by replicating the experiment with different subjects. Parapsychologists might point out that some people aren't as psychically in-tune as others, so different subjects will yield different results, but the stigma still sticks.

The point is god is made up by people who fear and do not understand the things around them. That is why there are so many religions in the first place, because different people believe in different things. Yea u said it yourself. No one knew the existenece of virus so they attributed dieases to supernatural forces and they pray for a higher being to save them. That is god. However, god didnt tell us the existence of virus. We found it ourselves. If there is god then did he create virus to kill us all? This is not the only reason. There is also the psychology of humans. lazy to explain now but if u take alook around ur religious place, which i assume is a church, u will definitely find more females than males.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Its a balance. Once science can prove it, it will shift and classify under science instead of under religion. Once science can prove everything, there will be no religion, no god. However, if science cant prove everything, there will always be a religion and god, because people naturally classify what they dun understand under religion. And i think there is an explaination for it. Was shown on discovery a few yrs ago. because of naturally body electromangetic manupilation or something, go check it out. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
