            <div class='col-md body'>Tracy strength cyclone heading to Qld<br>13:41 AEDT Tue Mar 8 2005<br><br>A cyclone as powerful as the storm that devastated Darwin 30 years ago was heading toward the Queensland coast, with weather forecasters unable to accurately predict where it will strike.<br><br>Cyclone Ingrid is rated a powerful category five and has a compact centre with winds gusting up to 290kph - drawing comparisons with Cyclone Tracy, which hit Darwin on Christmas Eve 1974.<br><br>The Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre in Brisbane said on Tuesday the cyclone was about 290km northeast of Cooktown and moving west at eight kph.<br><br>Warning centre supervising meteorologist Phil Alford said the cyclone had a very destructive core.<br><br>"Where Tracy was a category four, this is a category five," he said.<br><br>"It is a deeper cyclone but with a very concentrated sort of vortex."<br><br>advertisement<br><br>Warnings for the far north Queensland coast between Port Douglas and Cairns are being issued every three hours.<br><br>Mr Alford said computer models had been unable to accurately predict where the cyclone is likely to cross the coast.<br><br>"Because of that we've got a fairly large warning zone from Lockhart River to Port Douglas," Mr Alford said.<br><br>"But one thing is for sure. All models say it's going to cross the coast - none of them are saying it's going to turn around and head off towards New Zealand or something."<br><br>Mr Alford said it was possible the cyclone could turn more westerly or even south-westerly and pick up speed by Wednesday, when an upper level trough that is impeding it moves away.<br><br>Terry Dukes, the reporting officer and weather observer at Cooktown Airport, said weather conditions on Tuesday were fairly normal, but people were preparing for the worst.<br><br>"This one's a bit spooky," Mr Dukes said.<br><br>"The cloud hasn't moved for the last two or three hours as far as coming towards us so it tells me that whatever it's doing it's possibly going a little bit to the northwest.<br><br>"If it keeps going that way we are happy," Mr Dukes said.<br><br>Federal Liberal MP Warren Entsch, whose far north Queensland electorate of Leichhardt is in the path of the storm, has warned locals not to be complacent.</div>
