            <div class='col-md body'>When doing spring cleaning recently, found a file of jokes that I used to download from the Internet, this is one of them.<br><br>Some time ago, Mr. Clinton was hosting a state dinner when at the last minute his regular cook took ill and they had to get a replacement at short notice.<br><br>The fellow arrived and turned out to be a very grubby looking man named Jon. The President voiced his concerns to his Chief of Staff but was told that this was the best they could do at such notice.<br><br>Just before the meal, the President noticed the cook sticking his fingers in the soup to taste it and again he complained to the Chief of Staff about the cook, but he was told that this man was supposed to be a very chef.<br><br>The meal went okay but the President was sure that the soup tasted a little off, and by the time dessert came, he was starting to have a stomach cramps and nausea.<br><br>It was getting worse and worse till finally he had to excuse himself from the state dinner to look for the bathroom.  Passing through the kitchen, he caught sight of the cook, Jon, scratching his rear end and this made him feel even worse.<br><br>By now he was desperately ill with violent cramps and was so disorientated that he couldnÂ’t remember which door led to the bathroom.<br><br>He was on the verge of passing out from the pain when he finally found a door that opened and as he undid his trousers and ran in, he realized to his horror that he stumbled into Monica LewinskyÂ’s office with his trousers around his knees.<br><br>As he was just about to pass out from the pain, she bent over him and heard the President whisper in a barely audible voice, Â‘Sack my cookÂ…Â….Â’<br><br>And that is how the misunderstanding occurred.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>
