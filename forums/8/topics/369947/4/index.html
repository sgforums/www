              <p>Hi Tr_85 and worried87,</p>
              <p>I'm in  a similar case. I have been emailing them since 1 April 2010. But from what I've heard, it seems the process takes really long. Either they will send us to be attached to a school first and send us in for the Aug intake, or they will make us wait even longer and send us to be attached to a school after August and then send in next year for the intake. More waiting.. </p>
              <p>That's the real irritating part...</p>

Then again, how many times have you attempted to re-apply for the AED position? The latest recruitment exercise has just opened. Maybe you would wanna go for it again, no harm I guess. The thing is if you've set your sights on something which you are dying to do, you will slowly but surely get there. What's different is the path taken towards that destination.</p></div>

              <p>Hi Toheart89,</p>
              <p>For your previous post, it doesn't mean that if you got rejected the first time, no school will ever contact you again. However, it is true that it will likely be harder for you to get selected, since the information gotten from the previous interview is accessible by any schools which are considering you for another interview.</p>
              <p>For your current post, I will say that such working experiences will help, but as azzurifizzy has kindly suggested, it will be better for you to try applying to be a teacher. You may wish to consider applying for the degree course - though your GPA is lower than the 10th percentile, it is still possible for you to enter via special admission, given your teaching experiences.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>Yeah, have to agree with TrueHeart on the working experience part. It is usually an advantage during interviews. Gotta elaborate more on that and do a bit of convincing here and there. I know of someone who tried 7 times applying and going through interviews for a diploma in education before finally living life as a primary school teacher currently. So, it's never too late.</p>
              <p>Oh, if you're interested, there's an AED preview at the Teachers Network at Grange Road this coming Friday, 7th May. Details can be found in MOE website.</p>

              <p>Did you appeal for the Bsc/BA?</p>

              <p>Well Toheart89,</p>
              <p>It is really all about your niche and area of expertise and what you can bring to the table. Working experience doesn't count so much even if you're working in an education line. But as long as you have the specialized knowledge and relevant skill for the areas that the school feel they need help on, then that will be more advantageous. Take someone who has a diploma in IT for example. He has an extensive (3 years) and specialized knowledge in IT and if the school interviewing him needs help in guiding the students for basic computer skills, you are most likely the perfect candidate for the job. Why not ask the teacher to take up the role or multi-task then, you might ask? Well, what gives you the edge and makes you indispensable is that you have more experience and training in IT than a teacher who, say specializes in Maths but went through little training in IT back when he/she was a trainee teacher in NIE. </p>
