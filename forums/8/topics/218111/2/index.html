On top of that, there're so little players there.<br><br></blockquote>The playerbase may be small but we are one big family and we know each and everyone of the players.

I was already addicted.<br>Prophecy's atmosphere, technical side of mud and people captivate any<br>player who give it a chance. Prophecy is not a large mud. During one<br>year I've seen player activity fluctuate between 15-30 people. For<br>some reason, I've always been into muds of this size and I am sure<br>many people agree with that. Cozy is exactly what Prophecy is.<br><br>Prophecy's theme is from Eddings world of Belgariad and Mallorean.<br><br>I am sure many of you have read Eddings books and I glad to tell you,<br>Prophecy is better than the books. A lot better. One thing above all<br>in Prophecy is it's areas and quite original at that. Only few puny<br>original ROM areas remain and those are to be removed in future.<br>Player killing enviroment and Roleplaying enviroments are supported.<br><br>Immortal quests, auto questing system, Emily quests (mob throwing<br>scavengers and couple of other things), miniquests on areas not to<br>forget scrimmages (Wars nonPK people can join), quest equipment system<br>different roleplaying possibilities and actually pretty well<br>functioning PK setup. I've PKed in couple of muds previously but<br>here.. it really is smooth.<br><br>I would like to recommend Prophecy to everyone who enjoy well build<br>areas and mind boiling mini quests on areas. Some of the mini quests<br>are just awesome. PKing is fun and most of the people do it for that<br>sole purpose.

            <div class='col-md body'>Prophecy has been around since 1995 and is still growing. It is based oÂ­n the Belgariad saga by David and Leigh Eddings and runs with a heavily modified ROM 2.4 code with a lot of unique features, such as our clan system and the by-now famous quest system.<br><br>We are constantly adding new areas based oÂ­n the Belgariad with the help of our brilliant builder staff. The world looks and feels like the world the Eddings couple oÂ­nce created.<br><br>Prophecy offers 91 mortal levels and the choice of going PK-set at any time. Player Killing is encouraged but restricted to a 10 level range. Roleplaying is also highly encouraged and you are asked to use an unique name for your character in order to retain the MUD's roleplaying atmosphere.<br><br>You also have the choice of joining one of our clans, or you can create a clan that is even more to your liking. There are quite a few options for you to explore, so come, log in and find out.<br><br></div>
