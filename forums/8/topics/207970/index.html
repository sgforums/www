But that didn't stop Madam Guo from fighting him.<br><br>When the intruder, Yang Zhen Zhong, 34, allegedly put the knife on her neck, instead of caving in, she used all her might to resist him, reported Apple Daily Taiwan.<br><br>She punched him and kicked him till he was pushed into a corner.<br><br>Soon after, she had the intruder reduced to a bloodied heap on the floor loudly begging: 'Please don't hit me anymore.'<br><br>Her husband called the police and Yang was arrested.<br><br>FACE BRUISED<br>His face was completely bruised when the police got to him.<br><br>Madam Guo lives with her husband on the third floor of a condominium in Taipei.<br><br>The couple has two children - a son and a daughter.<br><br>Despite being of average build - Madam Guo is just 160m tall and weighs 50kg - she found the strength to take on the much larger man.<br><br>Yang weighs 75kg and is 165m tall.<br><br>Mrs Guo's bravery has impressed her neighbours who reportedly told her: 'You are great!'<br><br>The police said that when Yang was arrested, he pleaded for mercy.<br><br>He told the police: 'I have been jobless for a very long time and I have a mum who is ill and needs looking after.'<br><br>The police said that at about 5am on Tuesday, Yang, who was said to be drunk, headed towards the backdoor of Madam Guo's home.<br><br>He allegedly broke in through the kitchen window and entered the house.<br><br>He went to the living room, grabbing a fruit knife on the way.<br><br>He saw Madam Guo sitting on the sofa and reading a book. He allegedly held the knife to her neck and threatened: 'Don't make any sound, take your money out.'<br><br>Madam Guo immediately thought of her daughter, who was sound asleep. She was afraid that the girl might be harmed.<br><br>So, without stopping to think, she used all her strength to attack Yang.<br><br>CUT HER HAND<br>Using both her hands, she grabbed the knife from him, cutting her left hand in the process.<br><br>Then she kicked Yang till he begged her to stop.<br><br>When Madam Guo's husband heard the sound of the fighting, he rushed to the living room. He took one look at the situation and called the police.<br><br>He then picked up a wooden stool and joined his wife in hitting Yang.<br><br>The police have commended Madam Guo for her bravery.<br><br>However, she said she is now afraid that Yang might try to seek revenge.<br><br>A police officer advised women who encounter armed robbers to first think of their safety.
