Everyone would have felt tis way one time or other, esp after a long period of failures, setbacks, or when a monotonous dull and unhappening streak hits    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> It's natural. Sumtimes we have 2 try 2 perk up our lives by not tinking 2 much abt the tiring bit. It's the onli way 2 live, and get on wif life.<br><br>4 mi, I've felt like u did, several times. Despite all dat, I still appear cheerful and alwiz crack silly jokes and stuff not cuz I'm insane, but 2 loosen up. Sumtimes stress can lead 2 a person tinking dat life is meaningless and tiring. Accumulated frustration and "bottled-up feelings" are another cause too.<br><br>My life has been relatively zig-zaggety over the past 2 yrs or so. I went in2 JC after my 'O's onli 2 be hit wif severe bronchitis and I had 2 quit from my 1st 3 mths. When I came back as 2nd intake, I wuz hit by the massive stress and the pressure given by an unreasonable teacher. In the end, I broke down and quit totally from dat JC...dat marked the end of my academic life at 17 yrs of age....I wuz shattered, really shattered, my hopes of doing Psychology in Uni were gone 4 eva. (I wuz in the Arts stream...Arts is my life!)<br><br>2 add 2 dat, I have wat u call angina pectoris. A heart disease. I have angina and bronchitis all at the age of 17-18 yrs. It's very painful and I can't take long sch hrs cuz of dat. I really felt so depressed and wanted 2 juz die off, life seemed so tiring 4 mi den. Y wuz I so unlucky 2 be born so sickly? Y r my dreamz shattered juz like dat? And also, it is partly b'cuz of this illnesses of mine, dat...I developed anxiety and depression and oso an inferiority complex and had 2 be sent 2 a psychiatrist.<br><br>But after I finally saw tinks clearly and braced myself up, I felt like I wuz reborn. I saw new hope. I enrolled myself in a private sch, and took up IT courses. I made new frenz. With the shorter sch hours there, I could cope juz rite. I'll be finishing my Diploma soon. And I aim to go to poly nxt yr, eventhough I'll oredi be 19, and get another Diploma. I'll be stronger by den, cuz I oredi feel strong now (^_^) I got a strong will!<br><br>Life's tiring, but with the will 2 push ourselves, we can juz 4get abt tis aspect and live life to the fullest and happiest    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>~*Luv &amp; Huggies*~<br>BabyC|eFairy^ (^_^)<br><br>[This message has been edited by BabyC|eFairy^ (edited 18 April 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>haha, i actually kinda agree with ms.suess. acutally, it's good once in awhile to become depressed, and qn your life. it's a wakeup call, when the realities of life start creeping back in. occasionally, we need to stop and qn our whole life. moments of doubt and confusion is essential, in order for us to take stock of our lives and evaluate what we've done so far. if we just contd on with our life, permanantly content and happy, your life would be extremely pleasant.. but shallow. it's ok to be depressed once in awhile, and lose direction in life. but what's impt is how you eventually deal with it. you cannot get stuck at that pt, but rather, you have to face your problems and move on. if you lack a direction, find one. if there's somethg unsatisfactory, solve it! resolve the issue, move on, and you'll become a better person.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
