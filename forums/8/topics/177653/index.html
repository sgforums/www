            <div class='col-md body'>Have you ever thought how are you going to trade without these paper?<br><br>If you ever read up, which I strongly doubt due to your one-sided selfish view of your own (Therefore another point of mankind's downfall -- failure to consider both sides and jumping straight to the conclusion), you would have known that in the past there is barter trading.<br><br>But if you want to get someone's chickens inexchange of something from your own, let's say rice, there is a 33% chance of success -- the other two thirds being that he won't want to trade and the other being that he wanted something else (not rice).<br><br>Like take birthday presents and Christmas presents. Most children now are smart; they ask for money because they can get what they want, instead of adults giving them soft toys and toy cars -- who ever plays them?<br><br>After barter trade, simple shell trading appeared. People began trading with beautiful shells, which led to the creation of money and coins for measurement of better value of an object.<br><br>People view money as a tool, not evil, at that time.<br><br>Yes, people now are overly obsessed with money therefore leading to the society crumbling and depending on a few sole pillars -- the biggest one being money. Robberies appear because poor people are unable to farm their own food, which is because land is taken away by the Government for profiting purporses or housing to sell. Wood and other organic materials and places such as forests and jungles are significantly underpriced, because it is so easy to earn money now.<br><br>Human greed takes place. In the end, tools are often misused by man -- computers used to hack and pirate software, guns used to rob people instead of hunting and peacekeeping, and the most famous misusage being the dynamite, leading to the resentment for its inventor. The inventor then set up a fund to encourage more inventions to revolutionize mankind, called the Nobel Prize.<br><br>The thing that will cause our doom will be human thought and psychology, rather than money or other tools. Greed, hatred, jealousy can be felt in everyone, regardless of your state or character.</div>
