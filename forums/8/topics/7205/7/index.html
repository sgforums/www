            <div class='col-md body'>note that Singapore use the superior Harpoon instead of the Exocet like Malaysia.  The size of a ship (whether frigate, corvette, etc) determines high much absolute firepower it can carry and whether it can operate out in open seas.  This means that it is a possible for a smaller but technologically better armed ship to sink technologically inferior larger one.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Our Navy is important...Any service in the SAF is important and our navy is not strong and can be considered weak among our neighbours and it is true, but do you guys know that we got more planes than any of our neighbours? we got a very strong Air Force, with the modern warfare moving to the sky, Air Force plays an important roles....<br><br>Btw guys, in times of war, the Navy will operate closely with the Air Force when on mission as warships are vulnerable no matter how strong it is. So we have Fighter planes to provide coverage for the ships and they operate together... And with our planes we can destroy many of the warships who dares to invade us...<br><br>Btw, don't U all know that PM Goh had said before in few years back that he know that RSN is a modest navy and not a strong navy, and he rather use $$$ to buy more advanced planes than ships...<br><br>Sea, Air or Land, it is equally important but the SAF operates all service together closely and they dont fight and win the war individually guys. Btw wonder how many guys here are in the navy?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You will have to view things in context. It is quite pointless to compare the Navy as itself. The each of the SAF's services will NEVER fight on itself, it is always in cooperation with other services. The Navy will not have to fight a seaborne battle solo. The RSAF will support the Navy in the naval theatre, and that gives our Navy the edge over opposing forces.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i find that hor....... a carrier will fit a picture to the offensive role of the SAF. With a carrier.....i believe it is not the navy that is fighting onli.....unlike the US navy.....i believe the aircraft on the carrier will be flown by the rsaf pilots ( rsaf plays a important role when JSF comes in).......and same goes to the ammunition technician........the ship will of course be run by the navy.....a carrier also majorly support a amphibous assualt group which is a vital offensive tactics in the region.......with that, foot soldiers will be called in......with that ,i disagree that navy will solely be involve.......with this tactics....all three force are rallied together to efficently defeat the enemy.<br>with the carrier.....singapore can bring war to an enemy on two and hey more than two fronts......if together with long range interdiction or percision 'artillery' pieces (wat pieces u guess lah)..........victory will be us........</div>

We should concentrate more on frigates, subs and stealth technology.  the cost of running a an aircraft carrier is too high and the aquisition cost is crazily high.  A large one like the Enterprise cost US$4 billion. (not that subs are cheap, they're very expensive too but still within Singapore's means to operate)[/url]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We don need carrier lah! Carriers are meant for force-projection. Either to drop bombs on bad guys far far away or drop troops (them Americans use Marines) into bad guy land. Don't forsee the way Singapore fights a war to change so drastically anytime soon.<br><br>Frigates, stealth and subs are a good idea as mentioned above. Oh, and getting lotsa lotsa Eurofighters.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>-storm</div>
