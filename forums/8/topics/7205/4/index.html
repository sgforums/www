            <div class='col-md body'>Everyone's entitled to their own views. Unfortunately such topics never reach a satisfactory conclusion for all, because it always leads to two polarities -<br><br>a) "laymen" who don't know jackshit, or are accused thereof, whether justifiable of not;<br>b) "insiders" who refuse to play on the same ground and offer substantiation on grounds of confidentiality.<br><br>Obviously if either of the above is present, as it frequently is, the whole exchange is a waste of time. The former group appear to know too little to make a convincing argument, and the latter doesn't help things along by claiming to know the full facts and yet not elaborating. After a while there's nothing new one can learn from there, except maybe some new ways of name-calling. Everyone ends up hating each other's guts and the topic dies, only to get resurrected a month later, with the exact same result. Deja vu.</div>

Just small, fast, maneuverable ships with the capability of disabling not necessarily sinking enemy vessels.
