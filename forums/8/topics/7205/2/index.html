Your reasoning in here is acceptable, but if that's the case why izzit so? Is it cause they are so pampered at home or izzit the S.A.F. is too humble to the soilders. If that's the case then too bad.. Even if you have the highly sophisticated weapons among the world, without a well trained soilders, I mean with all the good qualities like<strong>INTREGRITY,INTELLIGENCE,STRATEGY,GOOD MORALE AND ABOVE ALL GOOD ATTITUDE</strong> You can't even defend the country.<br><br>For the physical fitness part, you attain it during your Basic Training phase and thru out your service.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Just look around those people in SAF, how much of intregrity you think they have</strong></blockquote>I thnk that you have seen the SAF by only one eyes. You might be doing an Clerical Job. That should be the reason why you can't turn around and see for yourself? Have you served in the Infantry, Artillery,combat engineer's units? If you had you wouldn't be asking others to look around. I agree one thing, that the organisation is not upto our expectations. It's true............ But it doesn't mean that We among ourselves can't keep up the intregrity together in ourselves.<br><br>Open for your other side of your views...<br>"DW" You are good in flaming ppl...

            <div class='col-md body'>You already mention without a well trained soldier, you can't defend a country. Yes correct, excatly thats the point. So how well you think are our training now? Getting tougher or softer? I am sure you know. You can be sure that there is actually no or little intregrity among the new soldiers.<br><br>HAHAHA, you are the first one who think I do clerk, I also wish to, HAHAHA. Since you ask me whether I serve Infantry, Artillery, combat engineer's units? Than I am sure you are from one of them.<br>Infantry: Have you seen those Indonesia soldier coming to one of our infantry unit for training. Just look at the difference in physical speed and military experience  between the 2 country soldiers, isn't obvious?<br>Combat engineer: Can be consider as one of the fittest soldiers in our forces. When they were in Thailand for training, the combat engineers compare to the Thai soldier in term of physical. Need not me to say.<br><br>You can go ask our soldiers what do they think of intregrity. I am sure you must be one of those big f**k that only know how to give command and don't know anything happening below you. Telling me intregrity in SAF, what a joke.<br><br>Well at least you know I good in flaming, than you must be one of those being flamed by me.

            <div class='col-md body'>You are wrong, US soldiers are not only good in physical and also mental. You don't know you go and read up books which wrote regarding wars involve with US, don't just any how shoot.<br>Foreign soldiers: You are wrong, I believe you are the one not at scene. Without a good physical and well experience soldiers and commanders, you can still say we are better. Their soldiers might not be as clever as ours, at least they are all brave and hardworking soldiers, unlike ours complain so much and nothing is done. Yes we are indeed better in one way, we are best in boasting. One good example is you Jubroni I must say.<br><br>I don't see the need to show you what quality I have, I don't need to be like you going around boasting this and that you are having. AS I had already said, you are those big <strong>F**K</strong> who only can see things above you. You wouldn't even bother to find out what happened to your soldiers as compare to others. Well you already can't stand my attitude, I can confidently tell you there are much more people who attitude worst and more bo chup than me. Don't tell me you never seen before? Come on, you claim you seen so much yet you can't even stand my attitude?<br><br>Finally you know how to spell "soldier", well at least you learn something from me now.<br><br>By the way, in this topic you claim we are so good, so powerful in defending. Yet in the topic "Can Singapore defend herself", you claim we can't even defend for 2 weeks. Please explain yourself and make your stand clear.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, SAF first goal is to deter war and not enter it.

DO you agree that even US soldiers are good at using body strenght rather than mental strenght.I can quote you a wide range of examples.<br>When we talk abt Indonesian <strong>SOLDIERS</strong>, I bet you were not at the scene...When we compare them with our Battalion, we are much much better in many aspects. It also applies to the Thailand <strong>SOLDIERS</strong>, They might be giant looking in appearance, but not the Giant appearance in their thinking Mentality.<br></blockquote>Firstly, in deterring war, appearances play an important role. If all your soldiers look sickly with a child frame (even though they are equipped with the best weapons), it'll be tempting for other nation to invade us. (Unless you have a very strong reputation and that can only be earned in a real war)<br><br><blockquote>I BELIEVE THAT YOU LACK ALL THE GOOD QUALITIES OF A SOLDIER.ahahahah YOU HAVE GOT NO SELF-DISCIPLINE,NO INTREGRITY IN YOURSELF.<br>That should be the reason why you have been using the "F" letter words in here...<br></blockquote>Pardon my poor English but from Times Chambers Learners' Dictionary, integrity means honesty, so is it that by not saying all those words even though you really have those feeling, you are a man of integrity.<br><br>In other words, do u mean that a man must lie in order to become one with integrity? **scratch my head**<br>**mummer to myself** so conflicting<br><br><blockquote><br>It doesn't matter that you are a BIG SHOT or SMALL SHOT! It matters to those who gets the work done... BUT not certainly to those who just serve for the sake of serving.......<br></blockquote>Agree, being BIG SHOT matters only to those who gets the work done. As they can claim credit for the work done (even though they do nothing but use their mouth - and I really mean mouth only, they did not use their brain hehehe)and no rewards for those who toil to finish the job (mostly by doing lots of OT).<br><br><blockquote><br>Like your attitude that you have shown here.. you are typical example of NS men in our Armed Forces.....<br></blockquote>I think you dun understand Singaporean? Do you know how most of the NSF and NSmen and Ex Regulars feel about the SAF? Go and ask those who dare to speak the truth. Try asking someone on the street to sign on with SAF and you see how each of them find some excuses. To tell you the truth, to the outside world, SAF is a place where those boot lickers thrived, a place where subordinates dun dare to question their superior even though they know the superior's decision is a mistake for fear of affecting their promotion etc.</div>

Since you wanted to know the opinion of the civilians, This is what I can feed you - Well if you would compare the pay schemes in the SAF and in the outside world!. you could find that the outside world is paying more. And the more you put in your best into your work, the more you are paid for! But in the SAF... I think I don't have to mention about that.

CBGs are offensive platforms and not defensive.  Singapore does not want to seem to be on the offensive at all.  We just want to show that we can defend ourselves when necessary (a lesson learnt from WW2 when the Brits surrendered).<br><br>6) A Nimitz-class aircraft carrier has a crew complement of 5500 personnel.

Why? To summarize all those bullshits I mentioned, basically, Singaporean have negative feeling towards SAF.
