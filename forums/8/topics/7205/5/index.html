It's just a debate here, not an arguement...whether or not we agree or disagree will not affect how the RSN is run.</div></blockquote>When people is discussing serious topic, yet you are joking here and there, so how can I trust when you would say this is a joke or that is a joke again? I don't take rubber ducky as a joke, I take it as a mockery to the navy.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Anyway, 1 test firing cannot prove anything.  That's why when tests are done, they are done rigurously and done a few times to get an average result.</strong></blockquote>Correct 1 firing cannot prove anything, than why do you think RSN didn't do anymore firing trial after so many years since you claim that they should try a few times?<br><br><blockquote><strong>Singapore only fired 1 missile because they are expensive and to shoot more, would bring public outcry (ie. Why waste money??).  The tests that have been done by the manufacturers of the missile would probably have been enough to convince the RSN to purchase those missiles.</strong></blockquote>Wrong, Singapore can afford to fire missiles. In matter concern defence, there is no such thing as waste of money. If you want to save money, than why want to have SAF in the first place? Don't forget defence has the highest budget, even higher than education and development.<br><br>Please advise how can missile test be done by manufacturer? For what I know, missile test can only be tested by using ship to fire. Not all missiles can be fired by any ship. A missile that is suitable for one type of ship doesn't mean it is suitable for another.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Singapore does not require large warships (CVNs and CG/CGNs). Large warships are usually used offensively, not defensively(However, some would argue that the best defence is a good offence etc).  Just small, fast, maneuverable ships with the capability of disabling not necessarily sinking enemy vessels.  That was the initial arguement I was stating when Carrots first posted :<br>10 frigates<br>10 ageis crusers<br>15 destroyers<br>and 1 aircraft carrier with a full load of planes</strong></blockquote>Who say that larger ship is only used to defence? If you expect to defence only, than why we want to have warship? Why don't we just equpipped ourself with all patrol crafts? We need larger type of ships like CC or DD to defence ourself against enermy. Do you expect small ships to defeat or sink a large ship if we are under attack?<br><br><blockquote><strong>Show of power can be a more effective deterrant than actual power itself.  If a big dog barks at you, wouldn't you be more afraid than if a small dog barks at you?  Would you risk getting torn apart by a big dog?  My uncle has a Rottweiler that barks real loud and looks really menacing but when friends come over, after barking for a while, the dog sits down and goes back...never bitten anyone before but friends are still afraid of it.</strong></blockquote>If you can only show off, than I want to see how long you can continue to show off. If a big dog bark at me, most probably I would be afraid at first, after few minutes knowing it actually can only bark and can't do anything else, I wouldn't be afraid of it anymore instead I hit back at the dog. We can't only depend on showing off, we need the actual strength.<br><br><blockquote><strong>We have not recently engaged ourselves in war so the potential of our navy is yet to be determined.  Hence, the best reference would be theories and lessons learnt from the past. True they might be wrong, but you want to start a war to test your navy?  That's why they conduct excercises and simulations.  It's the closest they can get without endangering life or limb</strong></blockquote>]<br><br>We had not yet engaged in any war, however our ships went out for countless of major or minor exercises with foreign navies or among RSN. We don't only take reference from books, we also learn our lessons from those exercise with foreign navies. We also get our facts from those trials. It is the real time involvement that really count and not those stated in books that count. From those exercise with other navies, I can be sure there is a need to upgrade our forces.<br><br><blockquote><strong>To the extent that our politicians can convince the UN to lend a hand and/or to the extent that our forces cause so much damage to the opposing force that they would reconsider war and find a more peaceful solution instead.  In other words, delay tactics.</strong></blockquote>From your post, are you trying to say no need to equipped ourself with the best, other people will help us? How much damage a war can caused our enermy knows how to calculate, don't assume that others are stupid just only to listan to what people said, they have their own mind to think. How long you intend to delay? You are only using a paper to wrap a fire. I even heard of people saying we are so good that can even attack other people and yet you are only saying we need to ask others help or delaying others.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Peace, okay?</strong></blockquote>Peace? No problem.<br><br></div>
