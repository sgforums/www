We don't really have quarter of a million soldiers...they're mostly NS Men.  If you stopped to think about it, how many of these NS Men are really fit for fighting? Not that much...it's all a show of force.  Barking rather than biting coz at the end of the day, when it comes to biting, we'd really be in trouble.<br><br>------------------<br>To err is human;<br>to really screw up, you need a computer</div>

Because if shows itself off very well.  Think about it, Singapore, with a population of 2.5 million, Malaysia 19 Million and Indonesia 200 million...where got fight?  We're just showing that we can put up a fight if need be and that with that kind of losses anticipated due to our show of force, Singapore will not be worth the trouble of starting a war over.<br><br>------------------<br>To err is human;<br>to really screw up, you need a computer</div>
