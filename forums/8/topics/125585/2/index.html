These people also like to burn their "paper money" at the corridore and they let those things fly. Mine is the last unit. So guess what, all their dirt, dust and burnt paper always end up in my unit.

My toilet leak and she called HDB ever hour to complain until we had no choice but to rush the job. During the rush job, the guy broke the aircon water pipe. My house at that moment was open. She just invited herself in with her shoes still on. Walk right to my room and demanded very loudly and righteously I fix the pipe immediately. I told her she is trespassing and if she don't get out the very moment, I will call the police and charge her. She somemore denied she did anything wrong and she has to right to walk in since my door was open. (I would like to get back at this b!tch! But I'll bid my time! )Then she proceed to call HDB again every hour to complain about the leaking pipe and demand I cannot use aircon, blah blah blah.<br><br>The block I stay seems to have uncivilized people.
