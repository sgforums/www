Enjoy!<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>What Kind Of Asian Are You?<br><br>Young Asians in America come in many forms. Below are the major categories. Most Asians fit into multiple groups. For example, Rice-boys can also be Fobs and many Tabs are Fobulous. The only groups that are never part of another group are the Twinkies and the Asian-Americans. Claim your Fobbiness! When you see your Asian friend, greet them with "Wassup Fob!" And if your Asian friend says something ridiculous, say "Fob please!" Of course, when a non-Asian calls you a Fob, that is grounds for a fight. Ahahaha... The categories below are to be taken lightheartedly. Read, recognize and laugh.<br><br>Twinkie<br>- Besides your nationality, there is little to distinguish you from white people<br>- Your significant other is not Asian and never has been<br>- You have few Asian friends, if any<br>- You are embarrassed at family events because you cannot speak your language and everyone has to switch to English to communicate with you<br>- You have no idea that the other types of Asians on this list even exist<br>- You think Hello Kitty is dumb and do not know what Sanrio is<br>- You are the only Asian on this list that does not know what Bubble Tea is<br>- You drive a Ford or some other domestic car and if you drive a Honda, it is stock<br><br>Asian-American<br>- You claim yourself as Asian, but real Asians think you're whitewashed and non-Asians see you as a foreigner.
