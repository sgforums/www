            <div class='col-md body'>There are many difference view between man &amp; women natually. Modern times make this even more difference.<br><br>Local girls do materialism. Basic fact to feel secure in life but has any life being "Secure" actually? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Of couse man do still wants pretty ladies. This "Prettyness" do not equal a happy life. The difference are getting so big that some are going overseas.<br><br>It's the sad fact that "Most Do Not Marry For Love." Because life is not that "simple" as before.<br><br>Humans wants everything to have benefits / Plus plus ..... Example: "if my boyfriend have cars, have big house .... " "If my girlfriend have good body shape, pretty face, ...." Even buying something humans wants something extra(s).<br><br>Not to forgot "The more you want, the more you afraid to lost." When then can we goes back to ... Simple Love Marriage?<br><br>Word of advice: Being rich and/or powerful does not equal to happy life. Money, benefits, security in life do not equals to happiness either. It's being who you are, what you do, being satified, acceptance of life as it is ... is key to happiness.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

My sentences has no relation to your post except for the ridiculing part. Ok...i think I just confused myself.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Anyway,  I think his delusions are ok..I find it corny but then some people believe that there is only 1 soul mate for them or believe in love in first sight or such things like that. Whatever makes them happy.<br><br>I agree that her main motive for marrying him is for a better life and not because of love. But who knows? She might see something in him that the local women didn't and come to love him.  Yes, I'm overly optimistic in a pessimistic world. Sometimes I delude myself.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br><span style="color: red;">As for the SPGs...is living with local men so bad that they have to seek a better life? From the article, his wife chose to marry him because she believed her local men do not treat women properly.  SPGs chose Ang Mohs because local men are boring. Slight difference there.</span>  </div></blockquote>Well, if people are in a position to choose, why wouldn't they? After all it is the inate nature of humans to never be satisfied.<br><br>Actually I think the SPGs are with the ang mohs cuz they're richer. Same thing as the foreign brides wanting to be with singaporean men.<br><br>Women will always want someone financially sound; of course some will push on and want only to be with someone who is rich. The thing I think he's deluding himself on (and some who also get foreign brides) is that they think foreign brides are not materialistic. Aren't their wants to have a comfortable life a material need/desire too? Compared to their counterparts back home, they are really living it up here. Thus it is probably all women who want good material comforts, a universal thing, rather than a problem with local women which is always said to be.<br><br>Cheers for your optimism. I only have cynicism to offer.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Men can't live up to local women's financial needs but it is because local women are materialistic.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>As for Vietnam women, I'm not sure...but the general feeling is that they have much lower expectation and they are more appreciative of their husband's work.</div></blockquote>If you grew up in a society like these Vietnamese women did, $1000 a month is a lot. Put it to the other extreme. In Europe this paychek is equivalent to some part time work.<br><br>That's why its wrong to say local women are materialistic. What's the yardstick anyway? It's much more fairer to say they have expectations mismatch. To the Vietnamese men back home, these women are materialistic. One just needs two sides of the coin to come to a conclusion.<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">SPGs want a way out of the HDBs. Vietnamese women worship the HDB and dsepise the slums back home. They have something in common. They despise what they have at home, and yearn for more. So how can you only say local women are materialistic?</span></strong></div>
