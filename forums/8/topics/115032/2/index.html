There are some men just want to settle down just as in the case of women who just want to settle down.<br><br>Most singapore men find singapore women overbearing unfeminine too outspoken too independant too materialistic due too high education or whatever reasons.<br><br>And most women being educated cannot bear to marry lower educated and chauvanistic men here or for whatever reasons.<br><br>Allow both sides to marry foreigners lah. why force the issue?<br><br>aside from having nationalistic goals that the population here must be uniquely pure blooded which I think is rather silly, whats the point of having <strong>pure bred's </strong>if nobody can get along.<br><br>After all marrige is a lifetime commitment and finding not the perfect spouse but finding the most livable partner and someone whom most able to get along with you should get priority. Sometimes getting along with someone could mean giving in to arguments may lead to happy relationships instead of both sides trying to fight to be right which lead to nothing.<br><br></blockquote>We Singaporeans are nvr pure breeds to start off with.
