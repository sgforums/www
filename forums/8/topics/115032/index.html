            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">An article from the Straits Times today:</span><br><br><strong>1,000 women wanted to marry him </strong><br><br>This was so even though technician weighs 180kg, has no car or apartment<br>By Chua Kong Ho<br><br>IN SINGAPORE, lighting technician Jackson Lee couldn't get a lunch date with a girl, let alone marry one. In Vietnam, the 35-year-old was king.<br><br>When he went on a matchmaking tour to Ho Chi Minh City last January, 1,000 young, single, virgin Vietnamese girls were dying to marry him.<br><br>It didn't matter that he weighed 180kg, had no car and lived with his parents. He just had to choose.<br><br>Faced with the prospect of appraising a queue of 1,000 women, Mr Lee chose the first in line - doe-eyed Nguyen Thi Kum Ngan, 20, who weighed 43kg.<br><br>Don't ask him if he felt good having 1,000 women want him.<br><br>'I'm not a 'chee ko pek',' he says, using the Hokkien term for dirty old man.<br><br>'Those men choose like they're browsing a catalogue. People say I paid money to go to Vietnam to buy a wife.<br><br>But I don't think like that. <strong>I think two people have to have a connection, a destiny, to be together.'</strong> <span style="color: red;">(Sidetrack: I think he's kidding himself here..how can he have connection without having talked to her?!)</span><br>Mr Lee took all of 10 minutes to decide Ms Kum Ngan was The One - a record at Mr Cupid International Matchmakers, the agency that arranged the tour.<br><br>It could have been even quicker, but Mr Lee asked Ms Kum Ngan to remove her make-up. p&gt; 'I didn't want to get a shock.'<br><br>Ms Kum Ngan was equally sure, though her reasoning was different. In halting Mandarin, she said: 'I didn't want to marry a Vietnamese man because they gamble, smoke, drink and beat their wives.'<br><br>Mr Lee had almost given up finding a wife.<br><br>'Too fat. No money. No car. But mostly because I'm too fat,' he said. 'They will never stand the humiliation of going out with me and being stared at.'<br><br>Mr Lee, who earns $1,700 a month working on projects such as countdown parties and the National Day Parade, has been happily married for a year now. The couple is expecting a daughter in March.<br><br>'Some of my friends doubted I could father a child because I'm so fat,' said Mr Lee, unconsciously reaching out protectively to his wife's swollen belly. 'Some even wonder whether I can have sex.'<br><br>By a happy coincidence, Ms Kum Ngan's elder twin sister Minh Huei lives not far away. Two days after Ms Kum Ngan met Mr Lee, her sister was chosen by another Singaporean on a matchmaking tour.<br><br>Mr Lee lives with his wife in Tiong Bahru at his brother's place, together with his parents and another sister. They are saving up to buy a three-room resale flat to raise their family. Ms Minh Huei lives with her husband in Toa Payoh.<br><br>The twins spend their days doing household chores, shopping at neighbourhood malls and watching VCDs. Sometimes, they steam crabs and cook hometown food.<br><br>Ms Kum Ngan said her marriage is happy and she is grateful to have left a hard life in Vietnam.<br><br>Not only are the rice farmers' daughters comfortable, but their marriages have made life much better at the family home in Soc Trang, southern Vietnam too. Their dowries paid for electricity, a television set, refrigerator and a telephone line.<br><br>Will the couple have a happy ending?<br><br>'I don't know whether she'll leave me in the future. I hope not, but you never know. But I believe in fate and destiny. All I can do is to love her and try to provide for her,' Mr Lee said.<br><br><a href="http://&lt;img%20src=">" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;<img src="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2005-01-30/0403.jpg"></a><br><br><a href="http://&lt;img%20src=">" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;<img src="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2005-01-30/0402.jpg"></a><br><br><a href="http://&lt;img%20src=">" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;<img src="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2005-01-30/0401.jpg"></a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think there's not much difference between local men who hook up Vietnamese brides, and SPGs who shack it up with old, fat balding ang mohs who can't get girls back home. (of course this is with the exception of genuine cases when the women and men did fall in love mutually, honestly)<br><br>So sore men out there, who have a need to put down local women just because they've been dumped many times for one reason or the other, be honest with yourself. It's alright to go for foreign brides and nothing wrong with wanting to start a family even though it's with someone you don't even know (albeity quite old fashioned), but do realize the limits of your actions, and don't say local women suck because they are materialistic blah blah blah and drag in ANY bad points you can find or make up- things like local women are so ugly.. and so on... be honest with yourself. The foreign brides you're marrying are just as materialistic relatively, and sooner or later they will become the equal as us horrid local women (according to those losers, we are horrid).<br><br>Wake up and stop deluding yourself!</div>

But these are probably the very same people (with their in laws included) who think Singaporean girls are not up to par, and they're materialistc and all that hogwash. They don't stop to think that their oh-so-pure-and-good foreign brides are just as materialistic.
