GAWDZ...!!<br><br>Me: Uncle, y u go by CTE?<br>Cabbie: Ler gio wa gia CTE, PIE mah!<br>Me: ...<br><br>Then the whole journey arguing with each other. Finally he RELUCTANTLY said to take it as he heard wrongly. WTF! After reaching my place, the meter reads $18 BEFORE midnite charge! My usual fare is only $13!!! I gave him $20 n got off the cab and hehe.. slammed the door shut and walked away quikly (in case he chased me for damaging door)...<br><br>Story 2<br>Going to work at EastPoint. Flagged for cab, got on and told him my destination. After driving for ard 10 min, cabbie started skolding Singaporeans having no manners becoz 1 pedestrian did not bother to thank cabbie for allowing him to cross zebra-crossing (?!?).<br><br>Cabbie: Singaporeans no manners! Only treat ang mos good! Like **$*! Stupid government dunno train Singaporeans until like wat! Singapore is a IRRITATING place to live in! Aiyah, some Europeans oso like bastards lah, so arrogant.<br>Me: ...<br><br>Then me not wanting much trouble started to reply my SMS. Suddenly...<br><br>Cabbie: Ei! Eastpoint hor? Aiyah! Y u nvr tell me earlier? Now missed turning!<br>Me: ?!?<br>Cabbie: Aiyah, so many ppl say want to go this place, but actually want to go somewhere near. Aiyah, now got to U-Turn!<br><br>WTF?!?!<br><br>So do I owe these 2 cabbies anything? GAWDZ! i'm just a paying customer!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i rely heavily on cab and will tell the taxi driver the exact route.<br>Clementi Central to Bt Panjang-&gt; Normally i will go by PIE then BKE, no taffic light so faster.<br><br>Once, after telling the cab driver the route i want to travel, he actually say seldom pple go by this route...blah blah, even on PIE, he was still trying to chage my mind to go by Bt Batok. BT Batok got lots of traffic lights and will have to stop ....and i am going to waste $$ on wait time. At that point in time, i feel like telling him: Damn it........I am paying u the $$$$ at the end, just go the way i tell u too lah! But i didn't. Anyway, thinkhe see my not very happy face, he LL also go the route i instructed. Think he want to save on his diesel. Fare is about the same for both ways but distance to bt batok is shorter as there are more traffic lights.<br><br>I hate talkative taxi drivers too. In the morning to work....i want to catch a few winks.....in the evening if i take cab back....i am very tired liao......dont want to crack my head for some small talk.<br><br>My friend encountered 2 very nice taxi drivers. She was moving house at that time and had lotz of stuff to move. They offered to help her carry the stuff up. Still not so bad lah.</div>

As i got no small change, i give the cab driver $50. He just snatch it over, look at it against his light(as if his light is UV ray), as if i'm going to give him a fake note. And just THROW the money in front of him (the place where u put all your display in your car and the packing ticket place).<br><br>Come on $50 not money ah. Although i know early morning confirm not much small change ... but come on lah .. taxi driver leh .. at least prepare for this kind of situation and don't THROW the money orh ... got our president face on it 1 orh</div>
