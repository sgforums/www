            <div class='col-md body'>With regards to the doctrine of Original Sin, it is strange that the Hebrews, who accept only the Old Testament Books of the Bible, were and continue to be totally unaware of it:<br><br>"But everyone will die for his own iniquity; each man who eats the sour grapes, his teeth will be set on edge. (NIV Bible, Jeremiah 31:30)<br><br>"What do you mean by using this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, 'The fathers eat the sour grapes,<br>But the children's teeth are set on edge'?

            <div class='col-md body'>Im not Obiwan  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> But heres what I think. There are some things in the bible which are not exactly "loud" largely because they are the lesser significant things. For instance while there were no mention of dinos its probable to some theories they are killed in the flood. To debate whether there is a flood or not is gonna take a million threads  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Someone else suggest the Bible's mention of the "giants" to mean dinos. But really they are the lesser impt things. Actually when HitSquad brought that up abt Adam and Eve it lighten up something inside. Guess I wasnt really paying attention to that portion, but yea it does make certain sense. Honestly the entire Bible contains many clues to many things we have answered this century alone but they are the less impt stuffs. The highlight of the Bible from the beginning right thru the end is about how much God loved us, and to reconcile us to Himself He sent His Son Jesus. The old testament contains many stories that somehow one way or another represents a type of Jesus and the promise of His death and Resurrection. It was all abt that. New testament simply tell us all Jesus has done and the new life someone who believes in Him can know. Simply that. There is no end to debating, one person finds a reason to shrug off the stories in the Bible another find a zillion others to pour his life for it. So no point debating  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Doom:</div><div class="quote_body"> [QUOTE]Originally posted by obiwan:<br>[b] how can the fault of adam and eve be added to me? you cannot blame someone who has never steal things and punish them, look at the law now. look at the parents now. we onli punished those who are at fault. you can't blame an innocent man, rite?<br><br>as for the other ppl, god never also said he created other ppl other than adam and eve also, this is what you think and added.<br><br>btw, the other ppl might be created by other gods or belongs to other tribes... who knows, nobody knows.<br><br></div></blockquote>Hmm..obiwan...you were a christian once before..maybe you can help me out in this rather than those self-proclaimed christians who goes around putting scarstic remarks to a genuine questions...<br>because i remember from school days that i was told by my school's pastor that the first creation of GOD was ADAM and alot of other animals..then Adam felt lonely and so..he created another being..known as women...and names her EVE..and they were the first 2 human beings created...is that truth or that they are not the first person to walk the earth..but got many more people??...<br>Why..somehow..i just got that feeling that Hitsquad is trying to bullshit his way thru things sometimes..??*Confused*<br><br>Geniune Question -&gt; Sarcastic Reply<br>*Shrugs Shoulder*<br><br>[/B][/QUOTE]<br><br></div>
