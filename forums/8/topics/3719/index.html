About how most pretty looking S'porean females are looking for characters instead of looks.<br>Well, frankly, forgive my language.....i think its total bullshits!!! Spore girls are only attracted to hunks, not dorks. Ask them, who they prefer, James lye the quessential Hunk or my normal plump friend who has the character of a saint. ok ok, lousy comparison but u guys out there get my drift right!<br>Characters?!?! hah, thats what losers like us mere looking mortals get when we fail to get the hand or a pretty babe.<br>I might sound like a angry and depreived young man, but thats how i feel.....looks and characters...sheeesh.

            <div class='col-md body'>*sigh* Beauty &amp; the Beast... How many people really understand the great romance behind it? I for one knows... a woman who is able to see beyond physical appearance, is aready one that is hard to find, much less to say a beautiful one at that, the greatest romance does not comes from the beauty but from the heart felt closenss of 2 person coming together. 2 person who are able to share pure joy, and pure understanding, nothing so physical, nothing so lustful.<br><br>A man who despites his not so average looks, have the courage to go for the beauty, is it not his love that gives him the courage? Is such not romantic enough?<br><br>I can't say what attracts a woman to a man, for there are just too many possibilities, but one thing I know and have expereince is the courage and sincerity of a man. I do not have many relatioships before, but to me, I find that when I am at my most sincere and have pluck up my greatest courage, I feel the most attractive, and sure enough I got my best gf.<br><br>It does not really matters if I am rich, it does not really matters if I am handsome, I stood there with my sincere heart, and she was moved. True romance is not easily understood, for I have friends who often ask this question, what does she sees in him? I think I am a lot better than him..., I often ask them a question back, then why do you not dare to win her heart from him? Most of the time they will give me answer like they do not want to spoil the relatioship e.t.c. But I think the reason is more than that, they are afraid, afraid to challenge what they do not understand, and that is the sincerity of the man.<br><br>Some of you out there might begin to think that I am not speakingthe whole truth, and rebukes like even if he is sincere, she might not like him... well, have you really been sincere? If yes, how sincere? Even if you are really sincere did you love for the woman, give you courage to put sincerity into action?<br><br>I am no great looker myself, just another plump guy with a funny face, but the greatest assurance I felt from my gal was that she love me for what I am, and that she did not ask me to change in anyway for her. She was close to perfect to me, and I am grateful that we were together before. I have to clarify that she did not leave me for my looks but because there is another guy who definitely suits her more than me.<br><br>Beauty and the beast, who is the beauty and who is the beast? from my point of view I think the guy with the courage and sincerity is the the true beauty. Not to say that the gal is a beast though. But look at things from a different perspective, and I am sure that you will begin to understand the beauty of this relationship.<br><br>Hata-san:<br><br>I know who you are, though you may not know me. *winks* Come for an outing an you will know the true me. Sorry for the stalker thingy, let me treat you drinks sometime, I am sure we will make great friends.<br><br>Tet:<br>I know because a little bird with beautiful legs told me. *laffs* And as your knight how could I not know what your mind is thinking?<br><br>*sigh* I got work to do, but after we parted I have already started to miss you all(legs and tongues inculded). *LOL*<br><br>------------------<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Just my $0.02 + $0.03(from Lex) worth</span></strong></div>

So sian and depressing!!! and one last parting shot to the females.....one close female friend of mine was confiding to me about her love life.I was listing out the virtues of one guy to her in the hope of matchmaking her with him. She stopped me short and said this," Hata-san, i have SEEN ur friends, and frankly, he doesn't attract me. Yes, he's a very sincere and got nice characters too....but no chemistry lah ( what she means is no look )"<br>sigh....and yes, her ex-boyfriend is a commando with a hunky built and a total jerk.</div>

Sometimes, it just being yourself.<br><br>Some pple used looks as a stand out quality but some don't. From there, it just up 2 the other partner that U R attracting C eye 2 eye with U. It does not happen 2 girls on guys. It happens vice versa.<br><br>I C alot of my friends who R gd looking having a partner who is not gd looking or vice versa. Its not how U look actually, I feel that is whether the person C eye 2 eye with your qualities (Qualities include physical or internal qualities).<br><br>Correct me if I'm wrong but from what I feel, it will come into this category if its look deeper into the situation.

With a presentable and confident look, u naturally attracts ppl to u, especially the females. Perhaps, given the time, the women might learn to appreciate ur look and character. The thing is, will the chance be given to u in the initial outings?!?! if a dork and a hunk is fighting over the same woman, which one u think is most likely to attract the woman's attention first???

Package, my dear, thats the most important thing. Initially that is. Here's another example:<br>Hunks who likes sport = sporty, outgoing and athletics<br>Dorks who likes sport = loser potato couch, cavemen and social loser<br>oh my god, i m such a cynical!!!!<br>someone save me!!!!<br><br>To miss kitty kat:<br>pleasing to the eyes??!?! how pleasing can a big fat ugly sloppy guy get.....As look as u falls in the dorks catergory, u can kiss ur love life bye bye<br>the only way dorks can get babes is thru<br>a) rich papa and mama<br>b) babes who need serious eye medications<br>c) God, Allah, Buddha, Ba1 Xian1 and ur religious inclinations....basically, divine help <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mr Hata San,<br><br>I believe most of us don't really belong 2 either of the categories but what I feel is that the categories U had mention R slightly 2 the Xtreme. Not every single Hunks or gd looking pple belong 2 the grp either.<br><br>I believe U R more sensible &amp; mature than me. Of course, I believe U have more Xperience when it comes 2 socialising.<br><br>I believe that a certain amount of packaging is needed but that is not really packaging but trying 2 be a little more neat &amp; tidy. Neat &amp; tidiness makes pple feel that his presentable &amp; more approachable.<br><br>Regarding dorks playing sports, U never know that certain dorks can do better in certain sports that hunks cannot do.<br><br>Different pple have different talents &amp; skills. Does not mean that a hunk can play soccer &amp; I can't means I'm not gd enough.<br><br>I may have other skills which the gd looking one don't have. The best part of it, those that R seating right in front of the PC reading this forum R not bunch of sloppy, sports mad, prehistorical fossils lying in front of their P.C. They R as active as the rest, even more active.<br><br>There R alot of eg I can specify, 4 not make this posting a long &amp; tedious one, I'll stop here &amp; I believe U get my point by now.<br><br>Bish,<br><br>I went 2 one of the BBQ they organise &amp; I find that they R fun, active &amp; friendly.<br><br>Last note 2 Mt Hata San, the pple that attended the BBQ that day, I find that they R all nice looking &amp; I mean ALL. Non of them look as Xtremem as U describe. Open your eyes on the streets &amp; probably U will C what I mean.<br><br>Any suggestions?
