But this example is the serve as 2 different poles for us to classify ppl. Are u leaning more towards the dorky side, or a u are hunk potential??? I would dare say i m leaning towards the dorky side and i DO know of a few friends who are hunks potential and when u mentioned the bbq outing.....if u will take ur time and observe them, u will know that they do differ into either camps.<br>As for sports and hunks and dorks, i m afraid u confuse my issue. i m toking about perception. For example, i m a fanatic Arsenal fan and i follow the sports scene religiously. And u know what my female friends called me....," silly typical male, boring, caveman,C.potato and what have u " Now, there's this close hunk who share similair traits as me and his verdict from the females...."ohhhh, so sporty, u r so Manly!!!, now i know where u got that fabulous tan!!!

Why is it so?  Singapore genes favor girls?

It's just that when it comes to the issue of judging males that women can tend to be more proned to be influenced of the outer appearances.<br>Do guys catergorise women?!?!! Do guys get turned on by Christy Cheung?!?! Of course we do!!!<br>As for women appreciating me.....hahahahaha, do i really give an impression of being such a loser?!!?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Ok lah, just that the real me isn't likely to attract the babes i want. So bo bian, have to package myself up and speak a bit more intelligently, sprinkled in a bit of Americano slang and think of something witty to say every 10 mins. Sigh....so sad hor  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>To Mayajade:<br>u know what, government is not only in the habits of differentiating ppl, ur parents do, ur teachers does so and we in certain situations practised it with ease.Yes, i know ppl should be measured accordingly to their individual status....and solely for the purpose of making light my thread, i resort to the common practise of catergorising ppl. U know, lawyers are famous doubleheaded snakes, accountants are boring geeks and blah blah blah  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>As for ur example of guys turning in their slippers in the recent bugis outing.....let me ask u something in return.<br>if that was james lye in slippers...i m sure ur opinion will be different. Some ppl can look sloppy and still carried it off becos they LOOK GOOD!!! Simple as that  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>To Alle:<br>true true, u are not discouraging anybody, and welcome to the real world where looks counts, regardless of what the romantics might say  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>To ataraxia:<br>i don't know this previous thread exist, but i m sure this topics have been going around in different veins (hmmm, veins....= Tet <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> )<br>As for the poor guy who got blasted, well, moi is ready to recieve some flaking over this issue  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> The world would be a very boring place indeed if everybody eats and shits in the same way  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">(pardon my language)<br>Yes, i agree that it's a tifle unfair to discount girls over this looks and characters issue and that there are girls who feel that inner beauty are more precious than the outer looks....but sadly, they are in the minority. Which fantastic looking girl would want to hang around a lesser looking boy??? After all, isn't looks that set many a girls' heart fluttering, isn't looks that provide the stimulous to the "chemistry" feelings???<br>Girls will never fall for me or *snigger* ever had a crush on me.....the only way i can ever win their hearts is thru characters and sincerity and hopefully my intelligence. Sigh...by then they already fall for other guys whose looks set their hearts and souls on fire liao  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Sad But True<br>Metallica<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Observers assume couples are equal. So, an average man with a very attractive woman gains status in the eye of the beholder. An unattractive man with a stunning partner really scores: Subjects make the highest assumptions about his job, bankroll and intelligence Â¡X attributes they figure he must have in order to have been chosen by a beautiful woman.<br><br>So do average-looking women enjoy the benefits of beauty when seen with a spectacular-looking guy? Are they thought to be extraordinary to have been chosen by a hunk? No. Observers don't get past being puzzled. Here the equality rule is trumped by an even more basic mindset: When it comes to judging women, the criteria are looks, looks and looks.<br><br>There's also a gender difference in how men and women feel about themselves when they're with very attractive members of the opposite sex. Needless to say, the men are thrilled. Fewer women, however, get a big kick out of being seen in public with a gorgeous date. They may be too busy worrying that he'll run off with the model on the next bar stool. Yes, we, too, buy into the idea that beauties get Â¡X even deserve Â¡X the most treats.<br><br>Appearance also plays a part in how we assess our relationships. Men evaluate their relationships less favorably after seeing physically attractive women. Women are not similarly affected by the sight of handsome men, but instead feel dissatisfied after exposure to men high in so-called "dominance" factors.<br><br>As charmed as we are by physical beauty, we seem to know that it's not the end-all. When study subjects were asked which of a series of photos of ostensibly married couples Â¡X whose looks were paired in all combinations of attractive and unattractive Â¡X were happiest, they chose the twosomes in which both were unattractive. The anxiety attached to competing in the beauty sweepstakes is considered stressful enough to make a marriage unhappy.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm, being awhile since the last person post this thread, me yi wei dying off liao...<br>anyway, thanks for ur academic suggestion to this phenonmenon which i see it everyday in my campus. and i think i did hear some friends mentioning ur point before....<br>ok, how abt this. I read in the papers recently that men are attracted to women's curvy bodies due to the genes we inherited from our monkey ancestors and all the mumbo-jumbo abt survival and continuing the human race. Now i know why i got this urge to laid every babe that comes along....hey, don't blame me, blame mother nature!!!(wonder if it's applicable when i said that to CJ Pow)<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>however, on a personal level, this academic stuff doesn't matter much. Try telling all this to a heartbroken dork who just saw his loved one being snatched away by a hunk...."darn, i know it's the law of nature at work, science proven it, pys books said that women don't really go for hunks etc etc!!!
