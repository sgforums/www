Then we are frustrated that the kids aren't old enough and we'll be more content when they are. After that, we're frustrated that we have teenagers to deal with. We will certainly be happy when they are out of that stage.<br><br>We tell ourselves that our life will be complete when our spouse gets his or her act together, when we get a nicer car, are able to go on a nice vacation, when we retire.<br><br>The truth is, there's no better time to be happy than right now. If not now, when?<br><br>Your life will always be filled with challenges. It's best to admit this to yourself and decide to be happy anyway.<br><br>One of my favorite quotes comes from Alfred D. Souza. He said, "For a long time it had seemed to me that life was about to begin - real life. But there was always some obstacle in the way, something to be gotten through first, some unfinished business, time still to be served, or a debt to be paid. Then life would begin. At last it dawned on me that these obstacles were my life."<br><br>This perspective has helped me to see that there is no way to happiness. Happiness is the way.<br><br>So, treasure every moment that you have and treasure it more because you shared it with someone special, special enough to spend your time...and remember that time waits for no one.<br><br>So, stop waiting until you finish school, until you go back to school, until you lose ten pounds, until you gain ten pounds, until you have kids, until your kids leave the house, until you start work, until you retire, until you get married, until you get divorced, until Friday night, until Sunday morning, until you get a new car or home, until your car or home is paid off, until spring, until summer,  until fall, until winter, until you are off welfare, until the first or fifteenth, until your song comes on, until you've had a drink, until you've sobered up, until you die, until you are born again to decide that there is no better time than right now to be happy.<br><br>Happiness is a journey, not a destination. Work like you don't need money, Love like you've never been hurt, And dance like no one's watching.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

If yes, how much, and for how long?<br><br>Chances are, many times, the happiness faded after some time, you began to take those things for granted, and you started to search for something new to make you happy.<br><br>The problem is, this could go on for your whole life, and you will never really be happy, because there are just too many things to attain in this world.<br><br>Perhaps, by being content with and appreciative of what you have right now, you would be a lot happier with life.<br><br>Contentment doesn't necessarily have to compromise ambition and the desire to improve. You can still seek to better your life. But if you become too obsessed with it, you could find yourself running around in circles, losing touch with the present and forgetting to be happy.<br><br>Sometimes, the source of happiness could just be contentment.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

They spent a day and a night in the farm of a very poor family. When they got back from their trip the father asked his son, "How was the trip?"<br><br>"Very good, Dad!"<br><br>"Did you see how poor people can be?" the father asked.<br><br>"Yeah!" "And what did you learn?"<br><br>The son answered, "I saw that we have a dog at home, and they have four. We have a pool that reaches to the middle of the garden, they have a creek that has no end. We have imported lamps in the garden, they have the stars. Our patio reaches to the front yard, they have a whole horizon.<br><br>When the little boy was finishing, his father was speechless.<br><br>His son added, "Thanks, Dad, for showing me how poor we are!" Isn't it true that it all depends on the way you look at things? If you have love, friends, family, health, good humor and a positive attitude toward life, you've got everything!<br><br>You can't buy any of these things. You can have all the material possessions you can imagine, provisions for the future, etc., but if you are poor of spirit, you have nothing!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
