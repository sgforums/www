            <div class='col-md body'>Just wishing every muslim members a happy Hari Raya Haji and for everyone else... happy holiday...<br><br>A little info about the day...<br><br><blockquote>Eid al-Adha is a religious festival celebrated by Muslims worldwide as a commemoration of Ibrahim's (Abraham's) willingness to sacrifice his son Ismael for Allah. It is one of two Eid festivals that Muslims celebrate (Muslims in Iran celebrate a third, non-denominational eid ). Like Eid ul-Fitr, Eid ul-Adha begins with a short prayer followed by a sermon (khuba). It is also called the bigger Eid because it lasts a day longer than Eid ul-Fitr[citation needed].<br><br>Eid al-Adha is four days long and starts on the 10th day of the month of Dhul Hijja of the lunar Islamic calendar. This is the day after the pilgrims in Hajj, the annual pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia by Muslims worldwide, descend from Mount Arafat. It happens to be approximately 70 days after the end of the month of Ramadan.</blockquote>So a little head's up, you may be seeing a surge of muslims in the local mosque tomorrow morning for the Eid Adha prayers and the quraban where livestocks are sacrificed and distributed to the needy...</div>

This is higher than the $270 set for each sheep for the past three years.<br><br>The sheep were distributed from 10pm on Tuesday to 5am the next day.<br><br>Mosque officials had initially been worried that there could be a delay in the sheepÂ’s arrival, as the ship that was carrying the animals had departed three days later than originally scheduled.<br><br>This was because there had been some problems during the shipÂ’s journey from Indonesia to Freemantle, Australia to fetch the animals.<br><br>The sheep are from Australia but the ship used to ferry the animals is from Indonesia.<br><br>But the sheep arrived in Singapore on time for ThursdayÂ’s ritual.<br><br>Also settled are another batch of 2,700 sheep which were brought in through another company known as The Meat House.<br><br>This group of sheep has been distributed to 12 mosques and various organisations.
