But your very demeanour (manner) projects haughtiness (arrogance, pride), pride and grand disdain (disregard) for lesser mortals (human).  Others are often found saying that anger sits on your nose and you are raring to give your piece mind to the first person that try to be funny with you.  You are selective in the choice of your friends, and have a low tolerance for the superfluous (extra) types.  Your tongue-lashing (attack) is generally in a soft hissing tone for when you scream, your voice tends to get shrill and loud and you do hate drawing attention to yourself!  When upset, you are angrier with yourself for having shown weakness, for the last thing that Scorpio wants to show is being out of control.<br></div></blockquote>cool as cucumber baby!</div>

You project a hard exterior but are actually very sensitive, a trait you successfully hide from others.  You can see thing with anger but will not betray your feelings.  But then, there are times that even you cannot control your temper.  Under such circumstances you can shout and scream, more with frustration at the situation than with anger at any particular person.  Your outbursts can shock others and can make them feel guilty too.<br></div></blockquote>Quite true lea.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> beat people consider or not?</div>
