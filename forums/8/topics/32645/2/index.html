As long as they dont write their own songs, they are at the mercy of the record company who engage people to write songs. They may decide to give the songs to another new boyband to be released to the public cuz the old boyband is losing appeal liao.<br><br>Dont you find it common that boybands have a short lifespan? Look at the metal bands from the 70's till now. They are still around and touring  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

You don't see F4 doing anything else other than acting in Meteor Garden with the same lousy acting throughout the whole series, or singing with their lazy boring voice, and they can't even dance, can they? You know, whenever I see F4, I really feel like sleeping. With the exception of Vanness Wu, who seems to be the only one in the group with some energy, the entire group constantly looks dead/stoned/bored and they are apparently not making an effort to spruce up their looks and give a sunny smile.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>At least 5566 is a group with one of the best voices around. The members do a variety of other things like hosting shows, modelling (in the case of Sam), and some of them actually dance relatively well. 5566 is a group which whenever you see them, they're always busting with energy. I must admit that the videos of them on Wan Quan Yu Le never fail to make me laugh, especially Zax Wang's hosting.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I guess if we really want to criticize boybands, it will only be fair if we put into consideration Japanese boybands like Arashi/Tokio/V6 or even girlbands, because I think boybands from both countries share quite some similarities. And why not also western boybands? Like Westlife or Backstreet Boys? On the western side we also see boybands that sing bubblegum pop. Remember Code Red, for example? A good example of a boyband that has now ceased existence in the music scene. Doesn't that sound like some boybands in the Chinese music scene?</div></blockquote>I agreee with u. Boyband is just like an orchestra  to produce great music and songs. You cant just depends on one single instrument to create a variety of music. i just dont know y ppl dont like boyband. As long as their voice is good and they sang well, it is just as great as any singer. Westlife and 5566 is the best. You cant just depends on look to be popular, and for those who support f4 is usually young gals.Do u see many guys supporting f4?But for 5566 and westlife is different, they have supporters from both gender.</div>
