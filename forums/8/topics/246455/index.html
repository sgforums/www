I think she can see your weakness (doesn't dare to say no) and continue to take advantage of you.<br><br>I understand you want to be nice, however sometimes you need to learn to protect your own boundary - to learn when to say yes and when to say no.  If you don't think you can speak to her directly, write her a note.<br><br>At the same time, talk to your company about the situation and try to find out if the company can find you another place to stay.  Since the company sent you there to work, it's an obligation for your company to meet your needs regardless the cost.<br><br>If you don't know what to write in the note, I am happy to help you to write it and I will try to put it in the best possible ways.<br><br>Be strong my friend.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
