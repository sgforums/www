            <div class='col-md body'>On the day that he was to enter the first grade, his father told him,<br>"Son, I want you to do well in this life and to do this, you need a<br>good education, so I will make you a promise! If you do well in school<br>and make all A's, I will give you ANYTHING that you desire." The boy<br>knew that his father was good to his word, as they were very wealthy.<br><br>At the end of the first grade, the son brought home all A's. His<br>father was delighted! "Ok, son, now it is time for me to fulfill my<br>part of the bargain. Just tell me what you want and you may have it!"<br><br>The son replied in a meek voice, "Father, I would really like to have<br>some yellow ping pong balls."<br><br>The father thought this a little odd, but being good to his word, gave<br>his son one tube of yellow ping pong balls.<br><br>The next year, the father remembered how well his son had done in<br>school the previous year and attributed it to his promise of a gift,<br>so he said to his son... "Bring home all A's again, my boy, and you<br>shall have whatever you desire!" The young boy smiled and headed off<br>to school.<br><br>This year, he also came home with all A's and his father asked," what<br>is it you wish, lad?"<br><br>"Sir, I would like to have a box of yellow ping pong balls!"<br><br>The father asked, "Are you sure, son? Maybe you would like to have<br>some comic books or a wagon or maybe a puppy!"<br><br>"No thank you, sir.....just the ping pong balls, if I may."<br><br>His father, wanting to be true to his word, went out the very next day<br>and bought his son a box of three dozen yellow ping pong balls. The<br>boy thanked his father and put the balls in his closet for safe<br>keeping.<br><br>The next year, the same thing happened.......<br><br>The father promised anything the boy desired.<br><br>Again.......all A's.<br><br>"I would like some yellow ping pong balls, dad!" was the reply.<br><br>His father agreed and bought him two tins of yellow ping pong balls,<br>which the little boy quietly put in his closet.<br><br>Sometimes late at night, the boy would take out his yellow ping pong<br>balls and roll them around on the floor, as they were very quiet, but<br>he always accounted for every one and put it neatly back into the<br>closet.<br><br>When the fourth grade came around, the father, feeling that his son<br>was beginning to mature a little, promised the same thing as before,<br>"Bring me home a report card full of A's and you will have anything<br>that you want, son"<br><br>At report card time, sure enough, the young lad again brought home a<br>straight A report.<br><br>"EXCELLENT! EXCELLENT my boy!! What would you like?? And none of this<br>nonsense about ping pong balls. Get a real present!!"<br><br>"But, FATHER, you said that you would get me anything I wanted!<br>Please, please, I would like to have some yellow ping pong balls as my<br>reward."<br><br>His father grudgingly agreed, because he figured, "If it gets the boy<br>to give 100%, then it is worth giving in to a `phase'."<br><br>The next year, the same thing........ yellow ping pong balls.<br><br>Sixth grade.......... yellow ping pong balls.<br><br>By the seventh grade, his father was beginning to worry about the lad,<br>but he once again asked the boy, "Well, you have once again brought<br>home all A's! What would you like to have? A minibike?? How about<br>unlimited access to the arcade with no limit on the amount of games<br>that you can play??"<br><br>"Dad, what I really want is a box of yellow ping pong balls."<br><br>Once again, the father agreed and brought the boy his reward of ping<br>pong balls.<br><br>Eighth grade........ All A's!<br><br>"What would you like to have son? A motorcycle? Maybe a new computer??<br>How about a party with all your friends on MTV??<br><br>"That would be great dad, but more than anything else, I would like to<br>have some more yellow ping pong balls!"<br><br>By the time the ninth grade rolled around, the young boy was turning<br>into quite a dashing young man, but he was shy and quiet and didn't<br>make friends well. His father once again promised anything that he<br>wanted for bringing home all A's.<br><br>The son, by now recognized locally as a genuis beyond his years, had<br>no trouble producing the needed grades.<br><br>"What is it that you want then, my boy??? How about a nice little<br>sports car, you know, something to impress the ladies...." *wink!*<br><br>"No dad, just the ping pong balls. That's all I really want!"<br><br>Tenth grade........ the same thing........ all A's and yellow ping<br>pong balls.<br><br>In the eleventh grade, the father was really beginning to be proud of<br>how his boy had grown. In just a couple of years, he would be out on<br>his own and the father was beginning to get used to the idea of his<br>son's apparent like for yellow ping pong balls. So when the time came<br>for presents, the father didn't even ask, he just gave his son another<br>box of yellow ping pong balls.<br><br>Now was the final year of school and once again the young man had<br>brought home all great grades. He was valedictorian of his class,<br>class president, man most likely to succeed and captain of the varsity<br>cheerleading squad, not to mention starting quarterback for the<br>football team and first string pitcher for the school baseball league.<br><br>After delivering his graduation address to the graduating class, his<br>father, beaming with pride, walked with him out to their car. As they<br>got in, his father said, "Son, I have a feeling what you are going to<br>say, but I must ask anyway......what can I do for you this year?? I am<br>sooooooo proud of my boy!"<br><br>"Dad, what I would really like this year is a brand new, bright yellow<br>Porsche convertible with mag tires, an AM/FM disc changer and a credit<br>card!"<br><br>His father was overjoyed!!! The very next day, he went out and<br>purchased the vehicle and had it delivered to the house, wrapped in a<br>huge bow and ribbon and with a ten foot card that read, "Thanks for<br>being my son!! You're the Greatest !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"<br><br>The boy promptly thanked his father and went upstairs and one box at a<br>time, loaded all the yellow ping pong balls into the back of the car,<br>carefully pouring them in until they filled the car, with the<br>exception of the driver's side floorboard. The boy, with a look of mad<br>passion jumped into the vehicle and floored it! He drove as fast as he<br>could go, while the ping pong balls `perculated' in the back. He soon<br>found himself on a high mountain road careening carelessly around<br>hairpin turns, when all of a sudden, one of the ping pong balls rolled<br>under his feet. Distracted at the thought of losing one of his ping<br>pong balls, the boy lost control of the car and went flying over a 600<br>foot dropoff!<br><br>The father received a call at work and was told that his son was still<br>trapped in the car and had little time left to live. His father raced<br>to the boy's side. It was terrible!! The boy was barely breathing .....<br>the car, a mangled mess of twisted metal and there were yellow ping<br>pong balls all over the hillside.<br><br>His father knelt down and<br>whispered in his son's ear, "Son, there is one thing<br>that I have to know......"<br><br>"All these years, all those ping pong balls.........what did you want<br>with all of those yellow ping pong balls???????"<br><br>"Dad, I thought you would never ask! Well..."<br><br>And then he died.</div>
