            <div class='col-md body'>I'm with Heng@. For something like this to happen, there are sure to be tell-tale signs (soil settlement, severe cracks on adjacent buildings etc) way beforehand. These signs may have even appear way before the morning of tt particular day. Yes, accidents like this can happen without warning signs. BUt i tink for tt to happen, it muz be triggered off by something tt is really massive, like earthquake, explosion, typhoon, acts of terror etc. With the absence of these massive factors, the retaining wall can onli fail after showing tell-tale signs. With that, i believe LTA knew something wasnt rite way before and it was their neglience to allow works to procede and Nicoll Highway to function while remedies were carried out.<br><br>ANd the incident about the LTA engineer whu commited suicide after killing his son. I believe yesterdaes Sin Ming Daily (wan3 bao4) reported on it and in fact did an interview with the dead LTA engineer's wife. If i'm not wrong, her husband had actually wanted a transfer frm the nicoll highway site but his request was rejected. He had asked for a transfer becos he felt tt his job was too dangerous. Thus, when his request was rejected, he felt depressed and this led to his suicide.<br><br>Above info based on my own memory....correct mi if i'm wrong..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The weather was scorching hot and dry before tt fateful day; perhaps LTA had made an assumption tt as long as it isnt raining, the force acting against the retaining wall will be at the minimum and had thus allow works to continue while remedies were introduce to strengthen the already faltering wall. Worst, LTA may have even kept this fact a secret from the workers in a bid to prevent works from falling behind schedule. LTA might have hope tt the wall will be strenghtened successfully and no one will ever noe that it came close to failing.<br><br>And after the completion of this CCL, LTA can then boast abt this and how they had overcame the problem. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br>What i am trying to say is basically LTA is trying to be tough but have failed, badly.</div>

WHY was it even there? opinion from a professional engineer, who works in the ISO QA sector, and who has done worksite and shipyard safety inspections for many years, told me, that cement mixer was there, PRECISELY to reinforce and stablise the structure. WHY would that be done? BECAUSE LTA ALREADY has warnings that the site is unstable. The fact that the cement mixer is there, puts paid to LTA's lie that they would only have had any warnings 10 - 15 mins. The truth is, they have had warnings for quite some time already. But instead of a complete halt in the work, they choose to continue even while they tried to remedy the problem.<br><br>So many warning signs, so man damning evidence.

Honestly, you will get better results just killing yourself if you want that. Thats the world for you, no matter how sad it might be.<br><br>HENG@ mentioned that LTA has a cement mixer at location when the incident happened, if going by what you say, then LTA made the right choice by responding to an emergency, nothing wrong there. No one can say that they do not have plans to close off the highway due to the threat, but perhaps the accident happened too fast.<br><br>On the other thread there was a mention about a cover-up of cars being trapped in the collapse. The blogger just doesn't seem to be using his common sense, please read my reply in that thread to see another conspiracy theory killed.<br><br>Once again, we cannot expect everything to be known, and made known. Accidents happen. Lets not make everything a conspiracy and arrow our Government.</div></blockquote>i think... IF as early back as when the LTA engineer who committed suicide, LTA knew that there is some danger, then work should have been stopped long ago and the problem rectified b4 any construction work continues... it seems what they did was try to rectify AND work at the same time, which is not acceptable, because to do so, u are working under unsafe conditions.<br><br>While that blogger seems rather rubbishy, and I did say so that he dun seem to be the most credible source, what we have here now, is an indication that LTA knew something was not right, YET choose to continue work. Whether they tried to remedy the problem or not, is not actually relevant. the cement mixer is noted here as an evidence that they know something wrong, and not that they had no warning like they claimed. The main issue here, is that they HAD ample warning, and choose to continue work at an unsafe site.</div>
