            <div class='col-md body'>Aren't we assuming too much about this accident?? All of you have your points, but all these are of no doubt, juz assumptions. True, you can say that putting 2 and 2 together makes perfect sense. Maybe even common sense. but then again, common sense isn't so common nowadays, is it?<br><br>Hmmm... Wait till LTA come see this site and a)admit and defend their actions or b)deny and attack our assumptions before i decide on which side to stand.<br><br>Some say LTA cover up their "crimes" and "hoodwink" us citizens, but the thing is, is there any point in us sh*tting in our pants about it? I mean, maybe LTA has had their doubts before, and through NOT telling us, they were actually able to successfully complete the work in time and with the quality that was expected. Mayhaps through those experiences they know that the best way to go about these situations is to take things into their own hands, 'cuz telling us would cause fear which was probably unfounded and leaves us doing slipshod work because the workers want to get out of the site ASAP?<br><br>If that's the case, i think that the fact that they tried to stabilise the structure shows that they were not "heck care" about it. And say, any engineers around here? Maybe they can only stabilise the structure part by part and they went about it as they continued the construction? I don't know.. I'm just a kid..<br><br>No one wanted an accident like this or any other to happen. And i'm sure IF it was the govt.'s fault they're darn guilty about it now, but they can't do anything..<br><br>*SiGh* Too many factors are causing me to feel ambivalent about this accident..</div>

All of you have your points, but all these are of no doubt, juz assumptions. True, you can say that putting 2 and 2 together makes perfect sense. Maybe even common sense. but then again, common sense isn't so common nowadays, is it?<br><br>Hmmm... Wait till LTA come see this site and a)admit and defend their actions or b)deny and attack our assumptions before i decide on which side to stand.<br><br>Some say LTA cover up their "crimes" and "hoodwink" us citizens, but the thing is, is there any point in us sh*tting in our pants about it? I mean, maybe LTA has had their doubts before, and through NOT telling us, they were actually able to successfully complete the work in time and with the quality that was expected. <span style="color: red;">Mayhaps through those experiences they know that the best way to go about these situations is to take things into their own hands, 'cuz telling us would cause fear which was probably unfounded and leaves us doing slipshod work because the workers want to get out of the site ASAP?</span><br><br>If that's the case, i think that the fact that they tried to stabilise the structure shows that they were not "heck care" about it. And say, any engineers around here? Maybe they can only stabilise the structure part by part and they went about it as they continued the construction? I don't know.. I'm just a kid..<br><br>No one wanted an accident like this or any other to happen. And i'm sure IF it was the govt.'s fault they're darn guilty about it now, but they can't do anything..<br><br>*SiGh* Too many factors are causing me to feel ambivalent about this accident..</div></blockquote>maybe in the past they also work with a lack of safety, but their luck held and nothing happened? that what u mean?<br><br>boy... u do not leave this sort of thing to chance and luck. no. not EVER. u do not hope u luck out and nothing happens. that is so NOT the way to work. its like saying that u have a 2 pin plug to go into a 3 pin socket and u just insert it in using a metal screw driver while the electricity is on, not getting electrocuted and thinking that since it worked, the next time u will do it again and hope your luck holds. IF thats the way u think about this... i can tell u... u best stick to a paperwork only job, because trust me, anything else and u are going to kill yourself, and maybe some other people besides.<br><br>i think u do not understand about the construction industry. U do not complete your work and get out ASAP just because u fear for your life. instead, u stop work immediately, make an assesment, remedy the problem, THEN go back to work ONLY when its safe to do so, and do a quality job. your saying that shoody work might result because they declare worksite unsafe, workers finish their work so as to leave the worksite ASAP, only makes me laugh.<br><br>Oh i din say they heck care. but the thing is while they were concerned, they also were depending too much on their luck to hold. Thats not the way to go about, esp in such a difficult and high risk category of construction work. once again, i will say, while they were reinforcing the structure, the truth is they didn't care ENOUGH to order a halt in work. Either they underestimated the extent and seriousness of the problem, or they were just depending a tad too much on good fortune to smile upon them.<br><br>common sense is not so common nowadays... and no thanks to the way our youngsters are educated nowadays...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Remember LTA and NE-line has similar calls before. have heard that the NE-line software is not entirely bug free and safe. that is why the many delays..engineers what to be safe, but politicians wants it running.... lucky nothing has happened yet.</div>
