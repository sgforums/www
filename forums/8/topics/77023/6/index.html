            <div class='col-md body'>Just my opinion.<br><br>Singaporeans are too complacent and too ignorant to care about this. They just read and whine about the current issue at hand.(Think sars , the iraq war and the nicoll highway incident) No action will be taken by the people.<br><br>Singaporeans are ignorant. The Government claims to be opening up but look at the Speaker's Corner , always empty and furthermore , it is beside a police post. Everyone is too busy working or playing to care about the dead.<br><br>You say you are voicing out what LTA knows but from my perspective , what you are doing is telling the usual people in this forum what is going on , that's about it.<br><br>The people who can or have the power to change things are not aware of your post , hope you understand that.<br><br>Somehow , 2-3mths later , everyone will forget about the Nicoll Highway incident just as they did the Iraq war and SARS. Do you still see people talking about it? What about the girl who died when a flowerpot hanging on a HDB railing dropped on her head? Anyone even remembers this?<br><br>Hope you get what i am trying to say. The Government claims that we(the people) have more say in things now , but i frankly think it is just an illusion to let the average Singaporean think they are in control instead of the dominant party in Parliament , everyone knows what party i am talking about.<br><br>Just my 5 cents.( Ran out of two 1 cent coins <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> )<br><br>- Leo</div>
