            <div class='col-md body'>According to source, Nicoll Highway MRT station has 2 by 2 stacked tunnels, like those in City Hall and Raffles Place MRT interchanges. This means that Nicoll Highway station has 4 platforms on 2 levels and may be an interchange with the future Bukit Timah MRT line or Eastern Regional MRT line.<br><br>The main reason why Nicoll Highway station tunnels are deep is that the tunnels between Nicoll Highway station and the next station Boulevard station (next to the National Stadium) has to pass under a section of Republic Ave which is a vehicular underpass, and the Kallang Basin.<br><br>This part of the tunnels is build using the cut-and-cover method. Also, as many has known, this part of the tunnels is on formerly reclaimed land.<br><br>In fact, Nicoll Highway station is the most tough project on the entire Circle line, considering the depth of tunnels, the tunneling method used, the soil stability and other concerns.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: red;">I analyse the situation and reports that ... the LTA and the Contractor knows the seriousness of the tunnel , that's why they sent in MR JOHN down for inspection , MR HENG was also sent by the contractor to check , and coincidently , MR HENG heard some sounds coming from the pillar and quickly dispatched those eight Thai up to safety !<br><br>Mind you , those inspections were performed during tea-break as not to create alarms for the workers too !!<br><br>Those LTA brats knows everything inside out !!<br><br>My conclusion : <strong>This accident can be avoided ! Only if the project is aborted ! </strong><br><br>But due to contract obligation , work cannot be suspend unless LTA approve ! Apparently , LTA knew about it , and chose to proceed with it , too bad !!</span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LTA cannot run away from the responsibilites of the entire incident, whether or not they knew the danger before hand. It is also obvious that they are putting a cover-up act to certain extend.<br><br>Fairly speaking, we ought to wait for the investigation report to be released.<br><br>Reminds me of the SIA tragedy.
