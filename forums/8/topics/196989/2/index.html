As much as I don't agree with using the excuse of weapons of mass destruction, or maybe even with the war itself, there are specific reasons why Iraq was attacked in the first place and not just any other country.<br><br>To be more specific, the rest of the world is relatively indifferent because of the fact that it's Iraq. I'm not saying the invasion was right or wrong, I'm just explaining the reason for what you perceive as a lack of action against him.<br><br>I also see a lack of action by certain parties/groups to help bring in Osama and his people. A lot of conflict can be solved if people with dangerous ideals were dealt with.</div>
