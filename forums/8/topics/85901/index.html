            <div class='col-md body'>Maintain status quo lah! Why declare independence? Even without war, the threat of war or the refusal of trade from China can make them suffer real bad already. There is so much trade between China and Taiwan right now.<br><br>Re-unification has no benefit for Taiwan now. Why subject themselves to be ruled by other people when they are actually independent?<br><br>Taiwan is pratically idenpendent now, with secret recognition from most countries. But cannot officially recognize because of China. But the official recognition has very few benefits. It is more like a face issue.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>maybe it's a matter of "face".<br><br>if china fails to "reclaim" taiwan, then it's embarrassing for the PRC, who is so many times bigger. as my Chinese fren puts it, "each Chinese just need to spit and they can drown Taiwan".<br><br>if taiwan returns to them, it's embarrassing for taiwanese who are always proclaiming to be the freest democracy in Asia.<br><br>so status quo seems the best method so far. this is a really tough tug-of-war, similar to tt of Israel-Palestine.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think its more than face. By allowing Taiwan to become independent, it<br><br>would probably ecourage separatist in Tibet and Xinjing to do so as well.<br><br>These two province account for abt 1/3 of its land mass and much of it<br><br>important mineral reserves, such as petroleum.

If Taiwan were to throw her full forces on a suicidal assault on China, they may not win but the aftermath for China can be a costly war effort. Rememer, China has a vast land scale and population but the main ride of her economy lies in the matured city areas (e.g Shanghai). Hit them there and we'll see what happens.<br><br>Unlike HK, Taiwan and Korea has a well kept army (guess HK has only their police department and SDUs to be proud of), which signifies a well governed and developed country. Let it be.<br><br>Ask me and i say i will choose <strong>answer #3</strong>.<br><br>HK was history and who knows? Today Taiwan, tomorrow Seoul and Korea. Afterwards Japan.......Singapore....coz we are somehow 'related'. Then maybe America? Coz they may claim that Christopher Columbus actually landed in India (instead of America) and the Chinese are actually the ones who founded the continent of America first before him.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Whether a war will be swift or not is anyone's guess but I believe China will probably use psychological and economic warfare to soften up Taiwan before an attack.The morale of the Taiwanese armed forces is also questionable although their weapon is high-tech. The dessertion rate would probably be high in event of a war with China.<br><br>Anyway Jiang has set timetable of reunification before 2020. His approach seem to be more hardline than Deng's who proposed to leave the issue to "the next generation" allowing more room for negotiations.</div>
