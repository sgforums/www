Grimlock and the Dinobots<br><br><img src="http://www.thephatphree.com/_photos/dinobots2200646.jpg"><br><br>All right, I get it. Kids love robots. Kids love Dinosaurs. It all makes sense on the business end, but what about the storyline side of it all? Why in the *&amp;$&amp;^ were these guys turning into dinosaurs and speaking at the level of a retarded-second-grader?

Three. They had to come up with three mother*&amp;$*ing characters for their original storyline. One was a fighter jet. One was a red sports car. And the other was a scooter. His name was appropriately, Scooter. How did no one see this as a problem? The bad guys had a motorcycle, a helicopter, and a sports car. Who in the &amp;$^( does the moped match up with?<br><br>1.

Ultra Magnus not choosen one, so cannot use the Matrix. In the end, Hot Rod take the Matrix and transform into Rodimus Prime.<br><br>Then at the end of Season 3, I think. Optimus Prime was reborned. Then after that the Japanese took over the production of Transformers. A few seasons later, Convoy ( Optimus Prime's Japanese name ) was upgraded into Star Convoy. Which marks the end of Generation 1 Transformers also.<br><br>Generation 2 was just a re-broadcast of Generation 1 and reissue, recoloured some of the older toys and also produced some new toys in the process.<br><br>After that comes Beast Wars, which is set in the distance future and past of Generation 1. This time there was no Optimus Prime, Optimus Prime was a great leader that lead the Autobots through victory of the Great War. The leader of the Maximals ( Descendents of the Autobots ) this time was Optimus Primal. He wasn't the leader of the Maximal. He was just a normal Maximal that was sent to escort Protoform X. He was grouped with a very small group of Maximals as well. However, while their ship was in space, they met Megatron ( Not the Generation 1 Megatron ). And they were told to retrieve the Golden Disk that the Predacons ( Descendents of the Decepticons ) stoled. They time travelled and landed on prehistoric Earth.<br><br>After that comes Robots In Disguise, which features a new Optimus Prime as a Fire Truck. This season has no link to the rest of the seasons.<br><br>After RID comes Armade and Superlink, a 2 season series that are linked, yes, the leader is still Optimus Prime, but no link to Generation 1 either.<br><br>After Armada and Superlink comes Cybertron, its also a stand alone series. Its leader is also Optimus Prime.</div>

Ultra Magnus not choosen one, so cannot use the Matrix. In the end, Hot Rod take the Matrix and transform into Rodimus Prime.<br><br>Then at the end of Season 3, I think. Optimus Prime was reborned. Then after that the Japanese took over the production of Transformers. A few seasons later, Convoy ( Optimus Prime's Japanese name ) was upgraded into Star Convoy. Which marks the end of Generation 1 Transformers also.<br><br>Generation 2 was just a re-broadcast of Generation 1 and reissue, recoloured some of the older toys and also produced some new toys in the process.<br><br>After that comes Beast Wars, which is set in the distance future and past of Generation 1. This time there was no Optimus Prime, Optimus Prime was a great leader that lead the Autobots through victory of the Great War. The leader of the Maximals ( Descendents of the Autobots ) this time was Optimus Primal. He wasn't the leader of the Maximal. He was just a normal Maximal that was sent to escort Protoform X. He was grouped with a very small group of Maximals as well. However, while their ship was in space, they met Megatron ( Not the Generation 1 Megatron ). And they were told to retrieve the Golden Disk that the Predacons ( Descendents of the Decepticons ) stoled. They time travelled and landed on prehistoric Earth.<br><br>After that comes Robots In Disguise, which features a new Optimus Prime as a Fire Truck. This season has no link to the rest of the seasons.<br><br>After RID comes Armade and Superlink, a 2 season series that are linked, yes, the leader is still Optimus Prime, but no link to Generation 1 either.<br><br>After Armada and Superlink comes Cybertron, its also a stand alone series.
