              <p>Join gang can be healthy tho, depend on what type of gang you joined, can be like my girl's gang called Angel's gang, the PAP gangs, CC gangs or the elites gangs.</p>
              <p>Sometime, you cannot blame the parents, as dual income family, both need to work to support a high cost of living here, so, the child may not be well taken care of, strayed and joined the gangs, it's a social problem, a problem within the fabric of our society, not just the parents, the govt do play an important role, if they had lowered the cost of living, mother can stay home to look and nurture kids, father will not need so much effort in making money and struggling to compete with foreigner, which will allow him more time and effort on family. On the other hand, the public must take a closer look to help these kids, not just brush them off with some blaming cultures on this and that parents.</p>
              <p>I have seen so many of them here, but instead of blaming or looking down on them,  I managed to convince many to take up course, go poly or ite to further their study, remove their egos and prides which gain nothing except more troubles. That's our duty as PRs or singaporeans, tho govt play an important roles, we, at the ground need to create the acceptance of these people and turn them around to be a good young person.</p>

              <p>In the early 70s, many locals join gangs to protect themselves especially against the Ang Mohs. The british soldiers used to bully us in Changi areas, some will fight with them while some call the British Military ploice for help. A group of us fought them before becos they went around disturbing our local girls.</p>
              <p>Back then we only have a common enemy and never fight among the ourselves.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I agree with Bus&amp;Soccer l0v3r (VO3x 1). Some ppl join gangs not to get involved in fights but to support their family. Gangs in SG and USA are vry diff. Those in like Compton USA have their gangs like the Bloods and Crips. Theses gangs fight with each other based on colour like red and blue not racial. In SG there are gangs but real gangs have a purpose, they want to earn money like through drugs, prostitution and even selling game cards. I think its ok if u join a gang bcoz u need to support ur family but just dont get a huge ego and start fighting. Violence will only lead to more Violence. Have a purpose in life and u will go a long way.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p></div>

              <p>they f*ck and have kids.  that's why.  you think parents really love kids then have kids ?  maybe some sincerely love kids then plan to have kids.  but majority are driven by sex that's how kids are born.  kids are the result of their parents' love-making act.</p>

              <p>ok..........i'll share my inglorious past here............only becoz of Rooney9..........</p>
              <p>when i was 15 or 16.............i was stupid enough to join a gang..........i was a victim of a couple of bullies and so though of joining a gang to get protection..........</p>
              <p>of course i thought it would be nice to do some bullying of my own...............and for quite a while i did bully and beat up a couple of young punks................we also indulged in some ''hit-and-run'' raids on 7Eleven stores etc etc............</p>
              <p>sexually harassing schoolgirls soon followed...............some of my gang also started sniffing glue and extorted money from younger helpless students...............</p>
              <p>finally we were arrested by the cops after some of our victims reported to the school..........thankfully i was let off with just a stern warning and decided i better quit the gang before i end up in boys' home or whatever.....</p>
              <p>i'll never forget the name of my gang though...............</p>
              <p>we were known as the.............. TEENAGE NINJA POWER RANGERS</p>

              <p>Join gang can be healthy tho, depend on what type of gang you joined, can be like my girl's gang called Angel's gang, the PAP gangs, CC gangs or the elites gangs.</p>
              <p>Sometime, you cannot blame the parents, as dual income family, both need to work to support a high cost of living here, so, the child may not be well taken care of, strayed and joined the gangs, it's a social problem, a problem within the fabric of our society, not just the parents, the govt do play an important role, if they had lowered the cost of living, mother can stay home to look and nurture kids, father will not need so much effort in making money and struggling to compete with foreigner, which will allow him more time and effort on family. On the other hand, the public must take a closer look to help these kids, not just brush them off with some blaming cultures on this and that parents.</p>
              <p>I have seen so many of them here, but instead of blaming or looking down on them,  I managed to convince many to take up course, go poly or ite to further their study, remove their egos and prides which gain nothing except more troubles. That's our duty as PRs or singaporeans, tho govt play an important roles, we, at the ground need to create the acceptance of these people and turn them around to be a good young person.</p>

              <p>I agree with Bus&amp;Soccer l0v3r (VO3x 1). Some ppl join gangs not to get involved in fights but to support their family. Gangs in SG and USA are vry diff. Those in like Compton USA have their gangs like the Bloods and Crips. Theses gangs fight with each other based on colour like red and blue not racial. In SG there are gangs but real gangs have a purpose, they want to earn money like through drugs, prostitution and even selling game cards. I think its ok if u join a gang bcoz u need to support ur family but just dont get a huge ego and start fighting. Violence will only lead to more Violence. Have a purpose in life and u will go a long way.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>    I knew a black track star from Watts. [ The roughest area of LA ]. He told me that the gang guys there were the low self esteem guys. He had been to university and had good self esteem.  But chinese gangsters are cool macho heroes who everybody respects</p>
