But at that time i am struggling with my grades, a fight in the poly may cause me to be expelled. I also do not want to make trouble for that lecturer ( she is a nice lady). However most importantly i was so stunned at that time, i mean i never expected this to happen in poly. I was just dazzled, what do you want me to do shout " Madam, madam, that guy pushed me to the ground"?? </div></blockquote>You did the right thing..<br>Sometimes it takes more strength or courages to walk aways than to fight back..<br>Not a great idea to start a Royal Rumble in a tutorial room :-p<br><br>i dun think he is really bothered by it now since he's so 'holy' now..<br>Doesn't matter whether you forgive him or not..<br><br>If he bugs you to forgive him, give him a big wooden crucifix and some nails..
