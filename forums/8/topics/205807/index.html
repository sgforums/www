            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Just now when i was going off after work i saw one of my former poly classmate. He approach me and says he is now in bible colleage training to be a group leader of a church group (i really do not know what is he talking about), i just act coldly and walk away. Below is the incident why am i so cold to him.<br><br>8 years ago, i enrolled into Singapore Poly and that guy is in the same tutorial class as me. We are not very close to each other but we did talk and chat at times. We had a module called Presentation and every one had to present a topic about themself. During his presentation, this guy went in front and talk about his family. He says he came from a divorce family and he is seeking courage from his religion which is christian to help him with this ordeal. Then i start to talk to him more after that incident because i envy his courage from a broken home. At the end of my first year, i failed 3 modules and had to be retained, that guy also fail his module and so we are retained together.<br><br>We are in the same tutorial class for Computer Programming with a younger batch of people so we only knew each other and hence we sat together during the tutorial class every time.<br><br>One day it was raining and i had to buy a magazine to shelter from rain, i remember clearly it was an eight days magazine with tom cruise and nicole kidman posing together from their movie "Eyes Wide Shut". It was an ordinary cover page with tom crusie topless and nicole kidman having a blanket on exposing HER SHOULDERS only. It was eight days magazine nothing big deal.<br><br>I reach the tutorial class and sat next to him and he saw my magazine and ask me to lend him read, i say yes. After reading he pass to me and shouted to the teacher, he shouted: " Madam, Chiwee (my name) bring a porn magazine to class" all of the sudden the whole class look at me and i was so embarrssed. I was so embarrsed and furious, i said to that guy " please dun be that childish". Then what happened was a complete shock to me.<br><br>That guy suddenly became quiet and paused for a while hence i never notice him. Suddenly he pushed me so hard that me and my chair came crashing down to the floor and then he push my table down also. Every one was utterly dumbfolded, i mean we are all poly student, what the hell is happening. This is no longer secondary school.<br><br>Maybe i should have beat him in the classroom but i just put the chair and table back and left the class during the middle of lesson. I guess the lecturer who is an old woman was so dumbfold that she just stood there wondering what to do. I mean this is poly and we are 19 at that time, a sensible age.<br><br>Anyway after that incident, we never talk and the guy started to skip all the lecture and tutorials and i only meet him at the final term examination and practical tests. In the end he was expelled from SP.<br><br>My question to you guys is will you forgive him, you are in poly and this guy pushed you down out of nowhere. Maybe this is common in Sec school but i think poly is a phase into adulthood. This guy has caused me a great deal of embarrsement in front of the whole class.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think that guy's a lil mad..well..diff ppl..diff rate and level of maturity..i don't know what others will say, but i guess for him, its a form of one of his childish fantasies. Given that he's from a broken family, i guess it has smth to do with the mum that left the family, so i guess its way of getting back at people of the opposite gender. Why you ? i dunno..but well...as time passes..guess there will be a time that you have to let go of everything. even tho i am now schling, but i still miss my old secondary sch days...ahhh..the stupid things i would do when i was young..but guess as we grow older..when we think back..we will realise how childish and foolish it was..Anyway..i wish ya all the best in life..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  Life still goes on no matter what happens...</div>
