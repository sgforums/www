I think the reason for him getting all worked up and rude that day may have been caused by family woes. Someone who comes from a broken family often has no one to confide in and the stress + worries starts to accumulate within him often resulting in severe depression that can cause sudden 'bursts of anger' which you, unfortunately, had to endure. But still, you should forgive him, knowing his plight and situation at home. He probably had moodswings that day and so took out his frustration on you as both of you sat together in class.</div>

I feel much happier and relieved now as i had been wrongly accussed of provoking that guy just because i said " please dun be childish".<br><br>The other classmates are saying i ruined that guy's poly life or even his future, as a result i have even more difficulty getting into group project after this incident.<br><br>I really only said" PLEASE DUN BE THAT CHILDISH".</div>

On my left is a BIG DRAIN, on my right is a BUSY ROAD with lots cars. I was so scare that he will use his inner strength and push me again. I was just like a crab walking with my fist held tight in case he displayed his "taiji pushing watermelon skills".<br><br>I was really thinking will he push me to the road to get knock by cars or down the drain.
