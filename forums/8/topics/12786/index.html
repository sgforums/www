            <div class='col-md body'>Actually hor...SCV also nothing much to watch nowadays. To think we pay so much for it. My house has the 'movie lover' package...and the HBO..hmmm...not that many great movies lah...they keep repeating the shows...only add a few new movies each month. Then the Star Movie channel...not much diff from HBO mah. The chinese channels are ok...a number of variety shows and sometimes got some good HK drama. But these drama will be ultimately shown on Channel U or Channel 8. Hmmm...if I were to pay for it, I won't subscrible to SCV...maybe just get the sports channel, the HK drama channels and discovery channel...got interesting documentary shows lor...like animals and stuff...quite nice.<br>I think channel U's programs are quite nice too. Maybe becos it's mostly other countries' variety shows and drama...less local production. Not that I dun wanna support local productions...but I still think as compared to the overseas production, local production still got a long way to go...especially in terms of variety shows. I quite like the Channel U's 'Zhen Qing'...but the show is a bit too draggy...over a thousand espiode leh...when then can finish watching the whole serial?!<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by FireIce:</div><div class="quote_body">agree with ruthie..each has its own plus points..<br><br>different shows...different target audience (of cos SCV more choices but u have to pay extra lah)<br><br>but if u are those channel-surfing type (meaning..oni watch a channel for 2 secs then switch here switch there tt type) then SCV more fun to "play"...<br><br>if u are happy with soapy dramas (zhen qing) and out-of-this-world taiwan variety then is channel U<br><br>if u prefer to see yucky fann wong and her colleagues..then is Ch8 for u...<br><br>if u are into news and current affairs..then tune in to ChannelNewsAsia...<br><br>if u like to see lions eat rabbits and Charlotte Church vibrating her vocals then Central would be good..<br><br>blah blah blah...<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>dont hink scv is in same category in the rest coz its not a channel its a provider. example: scv is not a channel, subscribe and you wull get all channels including all mediacorp/channel u/tvworks at no extra cost.<br>why i dont like scv is coz it starting to abuse its monopoly status. all long time scv subscribers will agree today ppl pay more for less channels. they pretend we will pay less but only in obscure situations they come up wif and most times ppl end up paying more. last time i had all sports channel wif no extra pay but now it is under package must pay, same with documentary channels.<br>unfortunately wif scv i get so many channels dat to take it away i will feel damn strange like tv veri few channels. mebbe one day another company open offer cable compete wif scv then things will be better, until then i s'pose i will still subscribe scv.<br><br>------------------<br>RockerZ!</div>
