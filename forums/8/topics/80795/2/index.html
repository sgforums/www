Apparently, there are now so called 'carbohydrate vouchers' issued to plump / overweight students for them to buy food in canteen. Every item of food they buy reflects the carbohydrates intake etc. Trim students are exempted from the 'voucher thang'. Instead, they wear an arm band which says 'trim &amp; fit'. Now, isn't it humilating for those overweight students to use vouchers when they buy food in canteen?<br><br>The minister for education wants students to be tough, and i highly doubt brain-washing students and controlling whatever they do is the way to go. For goodness sake, they are humans, not robots. You dun just mould them up like plasticines!<br><br>(WHO'S NEXT TO USE CARBOHYDRATE VOUCHERS?!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> )</div></blockquote>1. Does not take note of individual's metabolism rate or medical conditions, or even psychological developments in return for results.<br>2. Children can still eat all they want after school. There is no such enforcement after school hours.<br>3. Discrimination and separates people into groups. It won't be long those fat people will stick to their own cliques and those fit people to theirs. (Remember that the Nazis had armband separating them from other people too.)<br><br>The reason for TAF's failure was proper enforcement and planning, it doesn't matter what policy MOE wants to take, if there is no such things, it is bound to fail no matter what. I was in it, but I hardly went for the bloody thing, like I'm not tired enough after a boring school day to be jumping like a monkey-wannabe-gorilla in the aerobics class.<br><br>Much as I will sound old-fashioned and deemed as low success rate, proper education about health and fitness, adequate family motivation and environment, proper stress management know-how's and good mental health is the way to go in molding our so called future generation.</div>
