            <div class='col-md body'>lucky i was born earlier, haha else i would be controlled and need the coupons.  Anyway not that fair mah, some people eat a lot also don't get fat.  If i am a kid now i doubt i will get good results like that, because recess is my break, if cannot enjoy how to chiong during studies.  Control until so much, once they leave school may even rebel and eat even more.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, for my school, the TAF club members are supposed to set a target of how much weight they want to lose. They will be weighed whenever they think they have achieved their target. I think it's been pretty effective, because my school have been awarded the Gold award for the 4th time.<br><br></div>

Apparently, there are now so called 'carbohydrate vouchers' issued to plump / overweight students for them to buy food in canteen. Every item of food they buy reflects the carbohydrates intake etc. Trim students are exempted from the 'voucher thang'. Instead, they wear an arm band which says 'trim &amp; fit'. Now, isn't it humilating for those overweight students to use vouchers when they buy food in canteen?<br><br>The minister for education wants students to be tough, and i highly doubt brain-washing students and controlling whatever they do is the way to go.

            <div class='col-md body'>well, some schools make the pupils do some form of exercise during recess. so they are not allowed to eat during recess. but during lunch time which is after sch, i have seen 1 wolved down two portions of food. it really depends, some still remain fat, others have slim down quite a lot. more so for the boys. think home culture also make a difference...imagine going home and there's fried chicken on the table...the kid will still eat mah</div>
