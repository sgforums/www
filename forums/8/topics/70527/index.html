            <div class='col-md body'>A penguin one..<br><br>A Mexican newspaper reports that bored Royal Air Force pilots stationed<br>on the Falkland Islands have devised what they consider a marvelous new<br>game. Noting that the local penguins are fascinated by airplanes, the<br>pilots search out a beach where the birds are gathered and fly slowly<br>along it at the water edge. Perhaps ten thousand penguins turn their<br>heads in unison watching the planes go by, and when the pilots turn<br>around and fly back, the birds turn their heads in the opposite<br>direction, like spectators at a slow-motion tennis match.  Then, the<br>paper reports, "The pilots fly out to sea and directly to the penguin<br>colony and overfly it. Heads go up, up, up, and ten thousand penguins<br>fall over gently onto their backs.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>heard this one a while back..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Having chosen English as the preferred language in the EEC, the<br>European Parliament has commissioned a feasability study in ways of<br>improving efficiency in communications between Government departments.<br><br>European officials have often pointed out that English spelling is<br>unnecessary difficult; for example: cough, plough, rough, through and<br>thorough. What is clearly needed is a phased programme of changes to<br>iron out these anomalies. The programme would, of course, be<br>administered by a committee staff at top level by participating nations.<br><br>In the first year, for example, the committee would suggest using 's'<br>instead of the soft 'c'. Sertainly, sivil servants in all sities would<br>resieve this news with joy. Then the hard 'c' could be replaced by 'k'<br>sinse both letters are pronounsed alike. Not only would this klear up<br>konfusion in the minds of klerikal workers, but typewriters kould be<br>made with one less letter.<br><br>There would be growing enthousiasm when in the sekond year, it was<br>anounsed that the troublesome 'ph' would henseforth be written 'f'.<br>This would make words like 'fotograf' twenty per sent shorter in print.<br><br>In the third year, publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be<br>expekted to reash the stage where more komplikated shanges are<br>possible. Governments would enkourage the removal of double letters<br>which have always been a deterent to akurate speling.<br><br>We would al agre that the horible mes of silent 'e's in the languag is<br>disgrasful. Therefor we kould drop thes and kontinu to read and writ as<br>though nothing had hapend. By this tim it would be four years sins the<br>skem began and peopl would be reseptive to steps sutsh as replasing<br>'th' by 'z'. Perhaps zen ze funktion of 'w' kould be taken on by 'v',<br>vitsh is, after al, half a 'w'. Shortly after zis, ze unesesary 'o<br>kould be dropd from words kontaining 'ou'. Similar arguments vud of<br>kors be aplid to ozer kombinations of leters.<br><br>Kontinuing  zis proses yer after yer, ve vud eventuli hav a reli<br>sensibl riten styl. After tventi yers zer vud be no mor trubls,<br>difikultis and evrivun vud fin it ezi tu understand ech ozer. Ze drems<br>of the Guvermnt vud finali hav kum tru.</div>
