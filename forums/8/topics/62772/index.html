            <div class='col-md body'>I think i give really good testimonals  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  Muhahahaha<br>Here are a few of the testimonals i wrote for my friends<br><br><strong>1.</strong>This MORONTIC Dodi is always trying to be flaw in all his logic thinking, as if he was EVER logical... I remembered we got to know each other by stepping at each other's shoes back in secondary sch. Oh... you appeared to be like a super UNGENTLEMAN. Grrr... But, hmm... later i found out you are actually QUITE nice a guy to hang out with. Think i've only been to your house back in singapore Once and i've already fallen in love with it. It is so neat &amp; tidy. *of course we all know tat is all thanks to you mum* But Grrr... u never invite me over for the 2nd time and i hate you for that! *middle finger* Hahahaha. You played a CONSIDERABLY good host when i went over to Melbourne to visit you. And i still couldn't get ovet the fact that you bought a new toyota, somemore its a LEVIN!!! Are u trying to be Takumi or what? Anyway, really glad to be your friend even thou my conversation with you always left me thinking if i am stupid or what, coz u always never fail to remind me of that. But pple... he is not rude, just that he uses the wrong choice of words all the time when describing pple... -_-"' as if he is the only smart guy ard... YOU CALL THIS LOGiCAL??? Ok, good luck for your search in logic thinking, which i doubt u will succeed in it. NEH NEH NEH NEH NEH *middle finger*<br><br><strong><br>2.</strong>My first impression of Jiamin... I think i only get to notice you after the 4th or 5th lesson? I look out for cool pple to be friends with, maybe tats the reason y i missed u out for the first few days *Muahahaha* And when i finally got to notice you, i too question myself, why am i in the same class as u? All these super Guai looking girls... wat are they doing in a Mass Comm. class... they should fit in more to a biz or accounting class <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> Ok, then we finally become frens, as in i know ur name and u know mine. Then the most unbelievable fact is that you are an Arian too. I was like *What the Beep* Arians are cool... and tats totally opposite of u. I do not see you carrying any Arian's traits. And i feel ashamed that we share the same zodiac *muahahahaha* But as for now... all you pple should know how i think abt this girl, She's probably the most unpretentious person i know. At times we need her to tell white lies... her face just hit us that we had made her sinned and we should be guitly of that. She never fail to bring a smile to my face, okie, maybe more than a smile. Her jokes and silliness made me rolled on the floor. i'm not a crazy woman coz u had the whole group of us laugh till like this! U said i am a da ji da, that is becoz i am a true Arian ;p Arians are suppose to be good leader, daring and always speaks her mind. So what does that tells you, U make a good da jie da too! Now that we are more than friends :p ( ya know... you are my Part time lover) I will always cherish you. Thou shall i fight with stef till the end to have you MINE! After this lovely testimonal, you shouldn't doubt my feelings for you. I'm sure a better lover than ANYONE esle. We are Arians, and we compliment each other the best *wink* So... let kick Stef out of this picture! Cheers my dearest friend!<br><br><strong>3.</strong>Kok MeiMei, SELF proclaim MEIMEI... if i were you, i would go look into the mirror and reconsider calling myself MEIMEI, when i obviously know that MEIMEI can never be associated with a UGLY looking girl like CAROLYN HO. First impression of carol... A girl who smiles too much, sometimes it irritates me. A girl who laugh too loud, sometimes i wonder if she will die of asthma becoz of that. A girl who act as a social flower, sometimes i wonder if she is just the dung beside a lovely flower. SHe is the queen of Gossip, any infomation that you wished to be spread all over the school and do not wish to spend money on publicity and advertising. Go to CAROL... she is known as FM station 88.3, she will make sure that within a day, your msg will reach at least 100pple. With all these qualities, she made herself a good fren of mine. We share alot of unforgettable memories together. We did the " I don't care!!!" better than the original act cuter! We roll on the floor laughin like crazy over jiamins jokes and silliness. Carol, my dearie, Love you for who you are! stay bubbly and promise me that i wun get harrass by ur Richie if ever u go over your place yeah! hahahaha</div>
