In internet transactions, It requires quite a tedious process to really pin point whether it is a genuine fraud or the card holder is trying to pull a fast one.<br><br>In cases of counterfeit, most banks will absorb most losses except in special cases.  Outright cases are you are in Singapore holding on to the card but transactions are going on in another country.  In this case, most card holders are absolved from any blame because there is nothing they can do really.  Things to watch out for when using your credit card in foreign countries:<br><br>1) Do not let the card be taken from your sight.<br>2) If possible, use cash especially for small amounts.<br>3) You may be surprised, in HOT countries, hotels and popular shops can be the place where your card are counterfeited. In fact, anywhere is a possibility.<br><br>The advice is that, every end of the day after you finished using your card overseas, make it a point to check with the bank the next day a summary of your expenditure.  Most counterfeits only need a few hours to issue a counterfeit card once they collect your information.  Thereafter, a few hours later, you will most probably see trial transactions involving negligent amounts like $20++ or $1 at places like petrol stations and once those transactions go through, within hours, yuor card would most likely be maxed at places selling jewelleries, electronics and expensive and resellable products.<br><br>In cases of LOSS, if the fraudulent transactions takes place after you report loss, you are safe. If it is before, it is hard because again, some card holders may be trying to pull a fast one.<br><br>So whatever it is, take care while using cards overseas. In fact, if you can, dun use it at all unless necessary.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for the advice guys.  I always looked out for people swiping my card twice, etc...but technology has moved so fast.<br><br>I've used my card in so many countries, but only had such problems in one.  Is it some software spy programme or something of the sort?  Is it an inside job at these establishments?<br><br>Six months ago, the bank won't even tell me which establishment it was they suspected.  For this recent trip to JB, however, I only used my card for one transaction there - so I know exactly which one it is.  It was at a certain petrol station.  Ironically, I was the one who swiped the card through the machine (because the clerk was new and didn't know how to).<br><br>I really don't wanna carry so much cash around when I travel.  Perhaps the best way is to get another card with a very low credit limit like S$1000 (which is not that far off from my real credit limit anyway).  This card will be used only in those so-called HOT countries.<br><br>Hey, does anyone know how I can get my hands on one of these software spy programme to read other people's credit cards? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  Seems like easy money to me!  I don't even hear of the authorities busting any card-duplicating rings, save the occasional "face value" arrests.<br><br>PS:  Fugue, if I used cash, how am I gonna buy lots of things on credit and thereafter claim that I wasn't the one who bought them?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>dude. nowadays they don't need to 'double swipe' to copy your CC details. that's 10 years ago. now, they just need to install an add-on to the machine to do that to your card.<br><br>but panic aside. I suggest you hold on to 2 cards. one for your routine bill paying ones... and the other for travel. as you've learnt from your experience... changing details is not a fun activity. but you can reduce the encounter by actually limiting your card use to certain activities.<br><br>You can for example use a CB mastercard when u travel, and the CB visa at home for your singtel..etc...<br><br>So when the joker calls u up again to change card, you don't get so badly affected.<br><br>hope that helps.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi there,<br><br>For the tradition credit card transaction, the fraud cases in that M country and C country are extremely high.<br>Mastercard, VISA and other association have worked together to come out with an anti-fraud mechanism known as EMV. Most credit cards by 2006 will come with Micro-chip (Like the Cash Card) with all your information securely store onto the microchip. Only then, we as the comsumer will have a bigger piece of mind.<br><br>For the Internet world, an initative known as 3D-Secure was launched. It might be by end of this year that you will need to authenticate yourself with your bank that issue the credit card. In fact, a few famous local sites are using it in the background. But customers don't need to authenticate themselves yet.<br><br>Hope this helps.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br></div>
