            <div class='col-md body'>Such a lousy travel agency...took 3 months to refund me !<br><br>Reason i want refund is bcos they cancel the date i wanted to fly...excuses they cook up is "not enought pax" which is rubbish bcos when i sign up, already got 20+....<br><br>When i confront them, they change to story to " airline overbook" so not our fault...<br><br>I will never go to ananda travel again...<br><br>Another friend also had bad experience with the tour to korea last time<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My wife also had a same experience with Ananda Travels, she booked a F&amp;E tour to Sydney and Melbourne and it's minimum 10 pax to fly and upon checking, they had 10 pax including my wife and her sister. Then she paid fully for the tour and asked for flight confirmation and hotel confirmation. They said it will take 2 to 3 days to process as it's weekend.<br><br>One week had past but no news from Ananda Travels, then my wife called them up to check. Their reply was: "Sorry, I can't find your booking thus I can't check, how about coming down with your receipt so I can check again?." My wife got shocked, and nevertheless made a trip down. After waiting for 1.5 hours, they told my wife the booking had not been made and will make the arrangement straight away for her. My wife called me and told me the whole story.<br><br>Me was fuming mad and applied timeoff to go down to the agency and sorted things out. Upon reaching, me asked my wife for more updates. She said none. Me turned my back and shouted loudly across the agency for an answer. The manager came out to check the commotion and shouted back "Who's the idiot who shouted just now?!" Me acknowledged the manager and told him: "I am THE idiot you want! Now you better solve my wife's problem before I blow my top further that you will regret!" His face changed instantly, noting that it was me. Me was not pacified with the manager after he explained and told me that he would refund full amount. Me didn't take the bait and pushed my way further. "Look! You made a consumer promise and you are breaking the sales agreement! Due to your staff's neglience, you expect me to swallow all these and take my money back? If your staff jolly well knew it's not available for booking, then don't commit! It's only 4 days away to the tour date and you are telling me you can't do anything?! My wife and sister-in-law had made all effort in arranging their work and leave applications, and now it's a no-go?"<br><br>The manager then made a few calls and after another 1 hour, he told me that he's sorry and regretable something like this happened and me brushed him off. He told me what he could do for my wife's booking and he needed a day to arrange. Me gave him a deadline till the next day 3pm, otherwise me would lodge a complaint with NATAS.<br><br>The next day by noon, he called me and said he had arranged everything and my wife and sister-in-law could go for the tour as planned. In the end, my wife and sister-in-law were given free upgrades to business class roundtrip on BA flight, accommadations were also upgraded from superior to Suite while in Sydney and Melbourne and on top of that, free guided tours in Melbourne and breakfast on a raunch.</div>
