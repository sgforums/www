            <div class='col-md body'>haha farnni!!<br><br>&gt;<br>&gt;Most Embarrassing Feminine Moments A contest<br>&gt;was organized by "New Woman Magazine" on "Most Embarrassing moments"<br>&gt;topic.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;The following are few good embarrassing moments that magazine received<br>&gt;from<br>&gt;several women.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; ----------------- Curl Up and Die ------------------<br>&gt;<br>&gt;I walked into a hair salon with my husband and three kids in tow and<br>&gt;askedloudly, "How much do you charge for a shampoo and a blow job?"<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Melinda Lowe, 39,<br>&gt;Seguin, TX<br>&gt;<br>&gt; ----------------------- Pad, please! ---------------<br>&gt;<br>&gt;An insurance man visited me at home to talk about our mortgage<br>&gt;insurance.He<br>&gt;was throwing a lot of facts and figures at me, and I wanted to follow<br>&gt;asbest<br>&gt;I could,so I told my 6-year-old son to run and get me a pad.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;He came back and handed me a Kotex right in front of our guest.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Kathy Newman,46,<br>&gt;Winston-Salem,NC<br>&gt;<br>&gt; ----------------------- Ho, Ho, Ho ----------------<br>&gt;<br>&gt;I was taking a shower when my 2-year-old son came into the bathroom and<br>&gt;wrapped himself in toilet paper. Although he made a mess, he looked<br>&gt;adorable, so I ran for my camera and took a few shots. They came out so<br>&gt;well that I had copies made and included one with each of our Christmas<br>&gt;cards.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Days later, a relative called about the picture, laughing hysterically,<br>&gt;and<br>&gt;suggesting I take a closer look.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Puzzled, I stared at the photo and was shocked to discover that in<br>&gt;addition<br>&gt;to my son, I had captured my reflection in the mirror wearing nothing<br>&gt;but a<br>&gt;camera!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; ----------------------- Lady Golfer------------------<br>&gt;I was at the golf store comparing different kinds of golf balls.I was<br>&gt;unhappy with the women's type I had been using. After browsing for<br>&gt;several<br>&gt;minutes, I was approached by one of the good-looking gentlemen who<br>&gt;works at<br>&gt;the store.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;He asked if he could help me. Without thinking, I looked at him and<br>&gt;said, "I<br>&gt;think I like playing with men's balls."<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Colleen Collins,<br>&gt;31, Ferndale, MI<br>&gt;<br>&gt; --------------------- Nuts about You----------------<br>&gt;My sister and I were at the mall and passed by a store that sold a<br>&gt;variety<br>&gt;of nuts. As we were looking at the display case, the boy behind the<br>&gt;counter<br>&gt;asked if we needed any help.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;I replied, "No, I'm just looking at your nuts." My sister started to<br>&gt;laugh<br>&gt;hysterically, the boy grinned, and I turned beet-red and walked away.<br>&gt;To<br>&gt;this day, mysister has never let me forget.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Faye Emerick, 34,<br>&gt;Ellerslie, MD<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;The following are the top four winners of a Most Embarrassing Moments<br>&gt;Contest in the "New Woman Magazine":<br>&gt;<br>&gt; ----------------- Na-na na-na na-nah! ------------<br>&gt;<br>&gt;While in line at the bank one afternoon, my toddler decided to release<br>&gt;some<br>&gt;pent-up energy and ran amok. I was finally able to grab hold of her<br>&gt;after<br>&gt;receiving looks of disgust and annoyance from other patrons. I told her<br>&gt;that<br>&gt;if she did not start behaving "right now" she would be punished.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;To my horror, she looked me in the eye and said in a voice just as<br>&gt;threatening, "If you don't let me go right now, I will tell Grandma<br>&gt;that I<br>&gt;saw you kissing Daddy's pee-pee last night!"<br>&gt;<br>&gt;The silence was deafening after this enlightening exchange. Even the<br>&gt;tellers stopped what they were doing. I mustered up the last of my<br>&gt;dignity<br>&gt;and walked out of the bank with my daughter in tow. The last thing I<br>&gt;heard<br>&gt;when the door closed behind me were screams of laughter.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Amy Richardson;<br>&gt;Stafford, Virginia<br>&gt; ------------------- Surprise! ----------------------<br>&gt;<br>&gt;It was the day before my eighteenth birthday. I was living at home, but<br>&gt;my<br>&gt;parents had gone out for the evening, so I invited my girlfriend over<br>&gt;for a<br>&gt;romantic night alone. As we lay in bed after making love, we heard the<br>&gt;telephone ring downstairs. I suggested to my girlfriend that I give her<br>&gt;a<br>&gt;nude piggyback ride to the phone. Since we didn't want to miss the<br>&gt;call, we<br>&gt;didn't have time to get dressed.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;When we got to the bottom of the stairs, the lights suddenly came on<br>&gt;and a<br>&gt;whole crowd of people yelled,"SURPRISE!" My entire family: aunts,<br>&gt;uncles,<br>&gt;grandparents, cousins and all my friends were standing there.<br>&gt;My girlfriend and I were frozen in a state of shock and embarrassment<br>&gt;for<br>&gt;what seemed like an eternity. Since then, no one in my family has<br>&gt;planned a<br>&gt;surprise party again.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Tim Cahill,<br>&gt;Poughkeepsie, New York<br>&gt; ------------------ Priceless ----------------------<br>&gt;<br>&gt;One of the funniest "most-embarrassing-moments stories I've come upon<br>&gt;in a<br>&gt;long time was about a lady who picked up several items at a discount<br>&gt;store.<br>&gt;When she finally got up to the checker, she learned that one of her<br>&gt;items<br>&gt;had no price tag.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Imagine her embarrassment when the checker got on the intercom and<br>&gt;boomed<br>&gt;out for all the store to hear, "PRICE CHECK ON LANE THIRTEEN, TAMPAX,<br>&gt;SUPER<br>&gt;SIZE."<br>&gt;<br>&gt;That was bad enough, but somebody at the rear of the store apparently<br>&gt;misunderstood the word "Tampax" for "THUMBTACKS." In a business-like<br>&gt;tone, a<br>&gt;voice boomed back over the intercom. "DO YOU WANT THE KIND YOU PUSH IN<br>&gt;WITH<br>&gt;YOUR THUMB OR THE KIND YOU POUND IN WITH A HAMMER?"<br>&gt;<br>&gt; ----------------- Mom's Advice-----------------------<br>&gt;<br>&gt;A teacher noticed that a little boy at the back of the class was<br>&gt;squirming<br>&gt;around, scratching his crotch and not paying attention.<br>&gt;She went back to find out what was going on. He was quite embarrassed<br>&gt;and<br>&gt;whispered that he had just recently been circumcised and he was quite<br>&gt;itchy.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;The teacher told him to go down to the principal's office. He was to<br>&gt;phone<br>&gt;his mother and ask her what he should do about it. He did it and<br>&gt;returned to<br>&gt;his class.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Suddenly, there was a commotion at the back of the room. She went back<br>&gt;to<br>&gt;investigate only to find him sitting at his desk with his penis hanging<br>&gt;out.<br>&gt;"I thought I told you to call your mom." she screamed.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;"I did," he said, "And she told me that if I could stick it out till<br>&gt;noon,<br>&gt;she'd come and pick me up from school."<br><br></div>
