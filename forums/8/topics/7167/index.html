            <div class='col-md body'>yep yep agree with the points in this discussions. they are affecting quality designers.<br><br>by quoting that low price. most customers will grab the cheaper pricing. but thats because they do not understand how the design prices are broken down in the first place.<br><br>only until they see a quality website and compare it to their 7 dollar website, then they will realise that nothing good can come cheap.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Enigma<br><br>I am a web application developer.<br><br>Can't say that I have the flair that a true blue designer has.. but hee.. at least I don't put rotating animated gifs everywhere in my work. I design mainly user interfaces that complements the application that I develop.<br><br>Agree with the Coporate Identity as mentioned. I think design in all aspect gives the Coporate its identity.. the letterhead, namecard and website.. even the interior of the office..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> It makes the client thinks.. "Oh! That Company.. I recognize that color" everytime they come accross the company.<br><br>So it really is quite important if you wish to establish a coporate identity..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>agreeing with what you guys have said. Quality of work has to imrpove. I guess the key to a really good design is simplicity.

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm into simplicity as well... or as some say minimalist designs. Of course, the more traditional and old-fashioned people will consider such design simply as work of the lazy people.<br><br>Glad to know that there are people out there who feel this way. Even gladder to know that there are people out there learning flash. However, Singapore is not ready for it yet. Firstly the development of a flash site is too expensive due to the longer manhours needed. Secondly, they all want the boring conservative "so-called-professional" designs which will be much better built in HTML.<br><br>Sighz...  hopefully once our generation start working we'll get to see an improvement, since we are the generation that is exposed to internet and all.

            <div class='col-md body'>hehe...great to hear such response from budding designers &amp; freelancers.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Flash is, in my opinion, the best tool to do animation. Not just web-based but for videos as well. It's not like Adobe Premiere, which requires alot of CPU &amp; RAM power.. I even do static designs on Flash!<br><br>If you guys don't know yet, Sean, from Concave Scream is working at Kinetic. He did the whole band site as well as their music video, which was done in Flash &amp; Photoshop! Heard that he's pretty much in demand in the design field....<br><br>Here are a bunch of Flash sites for you guys to chew on. Maybe we'll all get inspired..hehe..<br><a href="http://www.concavescream.com.sg" rel="nofollow">www.concavescream.com.sg</a>  <a href="http://www.turtleshell.com" rel="nofollow">www.turtleshell.com</a>  <a href="http://www.lunarmedia.com" rel="nofollow">www.lunarmedia.com</a>  <a href="http://www.wallpaper.com" rel="nofollow">www.wallpaper.com</a>  <a href="http://www.finalfantasy.com" rel="nofollow">www.finalfantasy.com</a><br><br>p.s: my photoshop skills suck!!<br><br>------------------<br>"passing days half sober,<br>like a broken toy in<br>motion..."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Saw the sites you mentioned.. hmm.. really great job.<br><br>Some of those animations there could not have been achieved with the basic functionality with flash alone..is there more to it? Some animations looked like there is a whole lot of maths behind them.. really impressive!<br><br>Have seen Flash users use Flash like Director.. heee.. that's abuse!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, besides your basic normal motion tweening &amp; shape morphing, Flash utilises one function called Action Scripts.<br><br>Action scripts are like a programming language. A syntax. Creating a preloader at the start of a flash site requires action scripts. Some are easy, others seem like some programmers worst nightmare. Alot of sites out there utilize action scripts to achieve certain effects(i.e. advanced text animation, like that on the Lunarmedia.com site). I'm still experimenting...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Oh yah, here's something I did quite long ago. Used a little bit of action scripts for the mouse effect. It's just a draft but I'm gonna scrape it coz I think it's like f**k! The new one will be better...i hope!<br><a href="http://www.geocities.com/fox_scout_grp/new_site_2.html" rel="nofollow">www.geocities.com/fox_scout_grp/new_site_2.html</a><br><br>------------------<br>"passing days half sober,<br>like a broken toy in<br>motion..."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Action scripts don't really require too much programming knowledge to implement, though it would be next to impossible to attempt without any background knowledge.<br><br>The mouse trail uses a simple drag action combined with duplicate movie and some if else statements.<br><br>Flash proves to be quite a useful illustration tool as well, however I'm quite against the use of flash for making movie files, the compilation isn't as good as using director, and control over the "casts" is better in director too. However, it is much easier to assemble a movie in flash.<br><br>Have been playing around with flash for almost two years now, started with flash 3. Must admit that I find the compression and streaming technology rather attractive, as well as it's unparalleled animation capabilities, to date, I sometimes use flash to create animated gifs rather than fireworks.<br><br>To all budding flash users out there.. keep working hard.. we'll make it one day!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, I think flash is taking of particularly well overseas rather then locally coz local companies are not willing to bear the *extra costs*<br><br>I think flash is a great visual and audio presentation tool....<br><br>But when it comes to displaying big catalogues and chunks of information, I think normal HTML should do the trick...<br><br>------------------<br>Doh!
