            <div class='col-md body'>babe... The PLO existed because of the creation of Palestine. It was them jewish survivors of the holocaust that went in to arab lands and took everything away. the only reason why the PLO wants to kill ISRAEL is because the jewish state refuses to be fair. Just like the case in military Burma. Aung San Suu Kyi a democratic leaderwon the GE in the 90s was detained by the military Junta.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_Sun_Suu_Kyi#Detention_in_Myanmar" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_Sun_Suu_Kyi#Detention_in_Myanmar</a><br><br>The palestenian had a election yet ISRAEL rejected the election and still did not grant the palestenian freedom? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Palestine was a British colony. The Arabs were the majority until Jewish settlers from Europe came and started driving the Arabs from their land with terror tactics. It was not a conflict with religious overtones, only that the Zionists used religion to justify their land grab. After Israel declared itself as a state, Palestine did not do likewise because the Palestinian leaders did not accept the division of land with Israel.<br><br>I don't think what Israel and the Zionists did is morally right, but then, in international affairs, might is right and power grows from the gun barrel. Israel's military was better organised and stronger than the Palestinian. Sad.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is a long story between Israel and Palestine. Since I know how to read newspaper I already saw news of these two entities fighting each other. It will never end even if I lie down in the coffin.<br><br>Now is Israel officially recognised as a country? Is Palestine officially recognised as a country? In international games say World Cup, Olympics and whatever world tournaments are they allowed to send teams to participate?<br><br>I doubt they get majority approval as a soverign nation from the countries around the world. From what I know, Msian cannot travel to Israel and when Israel officials visit Spore, our neighbors will make noise.
