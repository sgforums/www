            <div class='col-md body'>Even if human beings do survive long enough to prevent us from killing each other or destroying the earth ourselves.We would face these problems--<br><br>1.Asteroids of comets of mass extinction level hitting the earth in the next few million yrs(very probable).<br><br>Ways to prevent:Maybe we have sufficient technology to blast this piece of rock apart?<br><br>2.The sun WILL become a red giant in a few billions yrs( assuming we are not being killed by the collision of the galaxies before then and that the sun and the earth is not affected by the collision which is quite improbable).Earth will still be destroyed in the end.<br><br>Ways to prevent: Planetary colonisation or interspace travels.I am quite sceptical this will work.As the only places probable we can colonise are perhaps our own milky way.Our nearest galaxy is the andromeda which is a few MILLION light yrs away.Assuming we have reached the technology available for ur to travel at the speed of light we MAY not travel through space for such a long time. Morever, Earth like planets may not be suitable for humans to live in as there are many complicated factors to consider.<br><br>3.Although scientists currently prefer the theory that the universe will expand infinitely through space and time, it has not been proven yet. Other scenarios for the the fate of the universe like " the Big crunch", "heat death" and the " big rip" will ultimately seal the fate of human beings(provided we are still there?).<br><br>Ways to prevent: Perhaps some alien superbeings has already come ur with technology to warp the entire space time physics so that they can be "Immortals"(I know this is hopeful SCI-FI stuff).Otherwise we can only pray that the universe will expand infinitely.<br><br></div>
