It's just like a different kind of belief. It's not weird, it's just another set of thoughts.<br><br>Those people who call it cult, mistake it for Morons, and those who didn't know what it means are sheer ignorant people. Those who understand the word ' Protestant ' should agree with me.<br><br>Mormon is just another unorthodox branch of Christianity. It is more flexible and it imbues good values, such as to be hardworking, or simply to be family-orientated into their believers.<br><br>Last but not least, Mormons believe there are many Gods in this world. Forgive me for saying things (may offend staunch Catholics), I once read this book publish by some official Catholic association (I shall not name it) which says that Gods/ Deities like those you find in Islam/Buddhism/Taoism are fake and only God is real. Of course, this is a narrow view from a slit eye. Mormonism accepts the fact that there are many Gods, and it is a matter of personal choice which one to believe.<br><br>And those who says Islam is a cult should be <span style="color: red;">beaten to death in the streets</span>. Such pathetic racist dogs.<br><br>I hope Singaporeans should have a bigger heart to accept others from diverse backgrounds.<br><br>Praise be.</div></blockquote>Those who associate mormons wif christian r retard, and those who didn't know that are sheer ignorant people(in yr own words)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>btw...u sound like those taliban guy who enjoy public stoning/beating ppl in the streets<br><br>Glory, glory hallelujah(x3)<br>The racist marches on...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Chim ah!  All the names mentioned, I have not heard them before.  Only two names I know : Mary and Jesus.  Maybe Joseph (can't remember whether Joseph was mentioned).  Really!  All the other names long long one.<br><br>And only this part I managed to understand when I glanced thru the book:<br>(cannot remember the exact words, but sounds/means something like that)<br>This person (dunno what name) was looking at Mary.  One angel came to him and asked him what he was looking at.  He said he was looking at Mary and he has never seen a woman so white and so pure (I think he meant innocent and sinless).  Then the next thing he saw was Mary giving birth to a baby whom she named Jesus.<br><br>The book is soooo thick.  Didn't really go thru much.  Anyway, soon after I brought this book home, one of my loved ones passed away suddenly.  Somehow I felt that the book brought bad luck.  So I threw it away.  I don't mean to offend any Mormons who might be reading this.  But it gave me a very bad feeling esp after my relative died.</div>
