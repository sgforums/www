            <div class='col-md body'>MY Night out at Wong Sans...<br><br>I don't know wheter the frowning face can portray what I really feel at this moment in time...but I shall try..<br><br>It seems that this board has become my default diary of thoughts and feelings...I hope that people who read it can gain some kind of useful knowledge from these stories I post...:-)<br><br>I knew this girl from a long time ago(6-7 years ago).  i used to go to school here wioth her and had a crush on her before...but back then, she was really the innocent type, so I didn't figure on doing anything or going for her.  I had a crush on her none-the-less.<br><br>Just a few days ago, I ran into her and was so excited.  I had thought that she was gone from Singapore for good.  And wow, she is beautiful now.  I just went with her to Wong Sans and met all her friends...they were all so pretty.  I asked her why all her friends are so pretty, but I already knew the answer...birds of a feather flock together...<br><br>Anyway, I was so depressed hainging out with her.  Here was a girl that had all the qualities that I had been searching for all my life...<br><br>nice bod, pretty face, very patient, sociable and friendly, can party, and still be so nice to a guy like me.  She's so sweet to talk to because she's just so happy and friendly and talkative.  Unfortunately I knew that she would never go for a guy like me...never.  So I sat and talked to her and her friends(wow, pretty).<br><br>I realised tonight what I had known for a long time but had come to forget recently...I realised that even though I was more sociable, outgoing, better looking than before, and cool,...deep down I was still a geek and it showed.  Every time I wanted to talk to her about anything substantial, I choke up and stay quiet the whole time...the words...Talk, why r u so quiet?..came up many times...<br><br>I was turned into a blubbering idiot in front of this girl who used to be the one who wasn't so social before.  To say that I am depressed is an understatement.  after this post, I will go to the corner and cry for the guy that is still so much a part of me.  He hasn't left me at all, I just had conveniently forgotten about him....I guess once a nerd, always a nerd.  Scuse me while I go and cry.....<br><br>...Ok, I'm back:-)  Somehow, I feel that this experience will leave me even more quiet and withdrawn than before...oh boy...doesnt sound good for my social life does it....<br><br>The Geek is back with a vengeance...!!!!<br><br>On the up note, it was so crwoded there that I was just inadvertently touching butts and breasts all over the place.  Woo-wee!!!Soft man....and I was dancing below a few girls on the corner podium who were wearing short skirts and tube tops...!!!!yaow!!!!Upskirt the whole night.  Oh yeah,  today was upskirt day for me.....<br><br>...earlier at school, i sat directly across from a girl who'se shorts kept opening at the leg opening.  Man, i could see everything...She had small flower panties...:-)  I wish I had my digicam, but friends haven't returned it yet!!!!!!argggghhhh!!!!!<br><br>Then wong sans...incredible.....That was the only good thing about tonight.  The bad was that i became that fool again...<br><br>I sincerely hope that some of u "geeky' people never have to forget that u were geeks before and then suddenly realise that u always were and it's never going to dissappear.  It will save u a lot of heart break.  believe me....Although some may think that it might be trivial, to people like us, I guess it means a lot....<br><br>firewire</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wow!  You had a crush on her before, and u still like her dont u?  In fact, even more than before?  R u a little regret now that u did go after her back then? Hey man! I can understand!<br><br>If I were in your position, I would probably feel the same! It would probably be like arrrghh!  Shit! Damned! Fuck me! Why I didnt go after her back then?<br><br>Well, we all know that life is full of shit, isn't?  But then again, it's not always that bad.  Case in point, just like your experince with brushing against asses and breasts.  I am sure they are nice and soft! I know!<br><br>Although your description about eyeing (I know it is not an intention of your part) on the girl's panty sound a little perverted,  I would do the same too!  Hey, I don't think any guys can resist unless he is...erm....!  U know what I mean.<br><br>Take it easy, buddy!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for the kind words power man,<br><br>I did have a crush on her before, but she was really just too goody-two shoes back then. But I don't regret not going after her before....Most likely she wouldn't have changed to be such a vixen while I was with her.  It probably only just happened recently and we would have been broken off long ago if I had gone after her.<br><br>But I still have that feeling in my chest when I'm around her.  Unfortunately, no spark on her side....She's so pretty/sexy and popular now there's no way she would stoop to such a low level to hang with me as my GF.<br><br>....hmmmmmm....thankx 4 the words anyway.<br><br>Goodnight    zzzzzzzzzzzzz</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey u knoe something Firewire?<br>i'm a geek too<br>i love being a geek<br>its a special trait<br>no other muthafucka has the same attitude as mine and i think its sacred<br>fuck the world-&gt; i'd rather be uncool and geeky then be a victim of aesthetics. i fight the damn world on my own terms as and when i like it. if it does not work then i fall back on being a recluse and be a pervy bastard and do the jcgirls website hehe<br>embrace geekdom!! seriously be a closet geek ...its kinda comforting to knoe that you have an alter ego- a private reclusive world to hide in. its where u gather ur scattered wits and feel most at ease. its the natural state of mind. Please firewire whoever you are don't chase out the geek in you. its part of you and excising it away from one's soul leaves a gaping hole in ones true character.<br><br>Longlive comics and starcraft and rainbow six and surfing for porn at two am in the freaking morning!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks all...:-)  It is rather depressing to think that people can feel bad about being themselves...but I guess it happens to everyone at some point in their lives....and I AM proud of Geekdom.  It's just that sometimes, it really doesn't work to our favor....just like the lone wolf syndrome...It's great, until u start to feel lonely...:-)<br><br>And yes...!!!!long lives comix and late night porn surfs!!!!

            <div class='col-md body'>Um...first things first...Firewire, what is Wong Sans ? I guess I sound really suaku asking this but hey...I don't cheong at all u see...so please provide an explanation ? Thanks.<br><br>Also, being a geek is okay as long as people can appreciate that you are a smart geek. Eventually geeks get the girl (as shown in many many movies like There's Something About Mary etc...) so I don't mind just being myself in front of her.<br><br>If I feel totally at ease with her and the same for her, then it'll be a good sign to "carry on" further.<br><br>See you around people and hope to meet up someday (though I will prob clam up and let Firewire do all the talking !!

            <div class='col-md body'>Whiz,<br><br>Wong Sans is a pub at Mohamad Sultan Road, next to UE square(clark quay there).  Quite a lot of happening babes there.  I just realised that there were more girls there than guys...and as I was saying to my friend last night...for most guys, they need to get a bit high first before they can bring themselves to dance, while girls can just dance right on the spot...Then as the night progressed i realised that what I said was true.  Most of the guys were just standing around while the majority girl crowd was pumping away with short skirts flipping over their heads and such....:-)<br><br>I hope that answers ur question.<br><br>The thing with geekdom is that it's never reserved just for people who look like geeks, but for people who have the heart of one deep down inside....But it's cool, we won't discriminate.....Geek Power!!!!( said to the accent of Malay rockers..POWER!!!):-)<br><br>Ha ha....have fun folks...I still feel depressed, but a bit easier about it now....<br><br>and it's ok about dumbness becasue the thing about geeks is that when it comes to social situations, we are prety much...dumb.  Ha ha...So we're equal whatever way u want to look at it.</div>
