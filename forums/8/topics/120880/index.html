            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Guys, I know this is rather an unorthrodox question and I dunno how many people here would know the answer but I'm gonna ask anyway cause I really do need help.<br><br>I'm in NS right now and I will be going uni next year (which means I took my A levels 2 years ago). I've been keen on studying psychology but I really dunno which uni I should choose. I dunno how many people would know this but NTU is having a psychology course beginning this year. As for NUS, it's psychology course is within it's faculty of Arts and Social Sciences.<br><br>While some say that NUS's course is better as it is more established, others say that only NTU's course is recognised overseas. Another thing is that psychology in NUS is very popular and difficult to get into (even after getting a place in Arts n Social Sciences) while as for NTU, you get it as a major once you register successfully.<br><br>All my friends are giving me mixed answers and I would really appreciate it if someone here could give me a clear and concise view of the situation. Thanx!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1. Luckily, you still have one year to decide. If you change your mind you still can change course next year.<br><br>2."Another thing is that psychology in NUS is very popular and difficult to get into (even after getting a place in Arts n Social Sciences)". From what I see, module bidding is quite competitive COMPARED TO OTHER COURSES. However, if you decide early on that you wish to major in Psychology and you declare that as your major, you will have an advantage in bidding for psychology modules, and it won't really be a problem. One thing is that you may not be able to get ALL the psych modules you want. I think probably will get most though. It'll be fine. What are your grades anyway? GP is useful.<br><br>3."others say that only NTU's course is recognised overseas"?? Honestly? I wonder why! Hmm. Anyway, at first glance, NTU's modules seem to offer the same range of topics as NUS modules. I can't be sure though. I've only looked through NUS modules thoroughly, they cover a broad range of topics in psychology (including the biology side) for you to pick and choose. First you have to decide, what kind of psychologist would you like to be?<br><br>4.Actually you ask students/friends also not much use. Not everyone may have the same path in mind. Psychology is a very very broad subject. Anyway, I'm not a student in there (yet), but I did my homework. Basically I asked those people already working in the field, and also emailed those lecturers at NUS/NTU.<br><br>If you have any more questions, do email me at ilangobi@yahoo.com, dun think I'll check back here. Thanks!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Regarding about the psychology course, it doesn't matter which uni you study from, as long as at the end of the day, it is recognized by the Singapore Psychology Society. But, getting a basic degree won't enable you to earn the title of Psychologist. You definitely have to study for an honours, or at least a Master's degree( in Australia) or at least a PhD( in States).<br>There are also education centres that offered Distance learning psychology degrees. But, before you applied for those psychology courses, make sure that they are recognized as a "Distance-learning" program in Psychology with their country's psychology society. Or else, all your time, money and effort will go down into the drain. You are able to study part-time with those distance-education program. However, they only offer the basic degree. If you want to further into Honours or Master, you will have to do it overseas. But, the good point is that, once you gain your honours or Master (in Australia), you can apply for the psychologist title in Australia with the Australian Psychology Society. Once you fulfilled their requirements, you can register with them as a psychologist. At the same time, you can come back to Singapore and register yourself as a Psychologist in Singapore. Singapore Psychologist Society will accept your application and automatic transfer if you are already registered with the psychology society overseas. In a way, you are actually recognized as a psychologist in both Singapore and overseas.<br>Hope that helps!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
