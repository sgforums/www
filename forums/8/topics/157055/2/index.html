            <div class='col-md body'>IMO it doesn't really matter...<br>i have been in 6 relationships before and only one of them is younger than me for 4 months..all the others are at least a year older than me and one of them is 2 years older than me lol....<br><br>woman likes guys to be confident..just go straight up to them and then do what you need to do and say what you need to say.<br><br>if a woman likes you, she will say yes no matter what..if a woman doesn't like you..she can come up with a billion reasons and there might even be a possibility that none of the reasons can be the exact reason that she wants a leave you...<br><br>overall: age is not a matter under consideration, but the ability counts no matter if it's in bed or physical strength or whatever but most importantly is the safeness you can can give her....<br><br>dominic</div>
