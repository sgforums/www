Dark, cloudy, cool, moist<br>and windy. Amazing, this whole affair of the weather!<br>We call it weather, but what is it really? Wind.<br>Rain. Clouds slowly parting. Not the words spoken about it, but just this<br>darkening, blowing, pounding and wetting, and then lightening up, blue sky<br>appearing amid darkness, and sunshine sparkling on wet grasses and leaves.<br>In a little while there'll be frost, snow and ice covers. And then warming<br>again, melting, oozing water everywhere. On an early spring day the dirt<br>road sparkles with streams of wet silver. So - what is weather other than this<br>incessant change of earthly conditions and all the human thoughts, feelings<br>and undertakings influenced by it? Like and dislike. Depression and elation.<br>Creation and destruction. An ongoing, ever-changing stream of happenings<br>abiding nowhere. No real entity weather exists anywhere except in thinking<br>and talking about it.<br>Now, is there such an entity as me or I? Or is it<br>just like the weather - an ongoing, ever-changing stream of ideas, images,<br>memories, projections, likes and dislikes, creation and destruction, that<br>thought keeps calling I, me, Toni, and thereby solidifying what is<br>evanescent? What am I really, truly, and what do I merely think and believe<br>I am?<br>Are we interested in exploring this amazing affair<br>of myself from moment to moment? Is this, maybe, the essence of this work?<br>Exploring ourselves attentively, beyond the peace and quiet that we are<br>seeking and maybe finding occasionally? Coming upon an amazing insight into<br>this deep sense of separation that we call me and other people, me and the<br>world, without any need to condemn or overcome?<br>Most human beings take it for granted that I am me,<br>and that me is this body, this mind, this knowledge and sense of myself that<br>feels so obviously distinct and separate from other people and from the<br>nature around us. The language in which we talk to ourselves and to each<br>other inevitably implies separate me's and you's all the time. All of us<br>talk I-and-you talk. We think it, write it, read it, and dream it with<br>rarely any pause. There is incessant reinforcement of the sense of me,<br>separate from others. Isolated, insulated me. Not understood by others. How<br>are we to come upon the truth if separateness is taken so much for granted,<br>feels so commonsense?<br><br>The difficulty is not insurmountable. Wholeness, our true being, is here all<br>the time, like the sun behind the clouds. Light is here in spite of cloud<br>cover.<br><br>What makes up the clouds?<br>Can we begin to realize that we live in conceptual,<br>abstract ideas about ourselves? That we are rarely in touch directly with<br>what actually is going on? Can we realize that thoughts about myself - I'm<br>good or bad, I'm liked or disliked - are nothing but thoughts, and that<br>thoughts do not tell us the truth about what we really are? A thought is a<br>thought, and it triggers instant physical reactions, pleasures and pains<br>throughout the bodymind. Physical reactions generate further thoughts and<br>feelings about myself - I'm suffering," "I'm happy," "I'm not as bright, as<br>good-looking as the others."<br>That feedback implies that all this is me, that I<br>have gotten hurt, or feel good about myself, or that I need to defend myself<br>or get more approval and love from others. When we're protecting ourselves<br>in our daily inter-relationships we're not protecting ourselves from flying<br>stones or bomb attacks. It's from words we're taking cover, from gestures,<br>from coloration of voice and innuendo.<br>"We're protecting ourselves, we're taking cover."<br>In using our common language the implication is constantly created that<br>there is someone real who is protecting and someone real who needs<br>protection.<br><br>Is there someone real to be protected from words and gestures, or are we<br>merely living in ideas and stories about me and you, all of it happening in<br>the ongoing audio/video drama of ourselves?<br>The utmost care and attention is needed to see the<br>internal drama fairly, accurately, dispassionately, in order to express it<br>as it is seen. What we mean by "being made to feel good" or "getting hurt"<br>is the internal enhancing of our ongoing me-story, or the puncturing and<br>deflating of it. Enhancement or disturbance of the me-story is accompanied<br>by pleasurable energies or painful feelings and emotions throughout the<br>organism. Either warmth or chill can be felt at the drop of a word that<br>evokes memories, feelings, passions. Conscious or unconscious emotional<br>recollections of what happened yesterday or long ago surge through the<br>bodymind, causing feelings of happiness or sadness, affection or<br>humiliation.<br>Right now words are being spoken, and they can be<br>followed literally. If they are fairly clear and logical they can make sense<br>intellectually. Perhaps at first it's necessary to understand intellectually<br>what is going on in us. But that's not completely understanding the whole<br>thing. These words point to something that may be directly seen and felt,<br>inwardly, as the words are heard or read.<br>As we wake up from moment to moment, can we<br>experience freshly, directly, when hurt or flattery is taking place?<br>What is happening? What is being hurt? And what<br>keeps the hurt going?<br><br>Can there be some awareness of defenses arising, fear and anger forming, or<br>withdrawal taking place, all accompanied by some kind of story-line? Can the<br>whole drama become increasingly transparent? And in becoming increasingly<br>transparent, can it be thoroughly questioned? What is it that is being<br>protected? What is it that gets hurt or flattered? Me? What is me? Is it<br>images, ideas, memories?<br>It is amazing. A spark of awareness witnessing how<br>one spoken word arouses pleasure or pain throughout the bodymind. Can the<br>instant connection between thought and sensations become palpable? The<br>immediacy of it. No I-entity directing it, even though we say and believe I<br>am doing all that. It's just happening automatically, with no one intending<br>to "do" it. Those are all afterthoughts!<br>We say, "I didn't want to do that," as though we<br>could have done otherwise. Words and reaction proceed along well-oiled<br>pathways and interconnections. A thought about the loss of a loved one comes<br>up and immediately the solar plexus tightens in pain. Fantasy of lovemaking<br>occurs and an ocean of pleasure ensues. Who does all that? Thought says, "I<br>do. I'm doing that to myself."<br>To whom is it happening? Thought says, "To me, of<br>course!"<br><br>But where and what is this I, this me, aside from all the thoughts and<br>feelings, the palpitating heart, the painful and pleasurable energies<br>circulating throughout the organism? Who could possibly be doing it all with<br>such amazing speed and precision? Thinking about ourselves and the<br>triggering of physiological reactions takes time, but present awareness<br>brings the whole drama to light instantly. Everything is happening on its<br>own. No one is directing the show!<br>Right at this moment wind is storming, windows are<br>rattling, tree branches are creaking, and leaves are quivering. It's all<br>here in the listening - but whose listening is it? Mine? Yours? We say, "I'm<br>listening," or, "I cannot listen as well as you do," and these words<br>befuddle the mind with feelings and emotions learned long ago. You may be<br>protesting, "My hearing isn't yours. Your body isn't mine." We have thought<br>like that for eons and behave accordingly; but at this moment can there be<br>just the sound of swaying trees and rustling leaves and fresh air from the<br>open window cooling the skin? It's not happening to anyone. It's simply<br>present for all of us, isn't it?</div>

It's not happening to anyone. It's simply<br>present for all of us, isn't it?<br><br>Do I sound as though I'm trying to convince you of something? The passion<br>arising in trying to communicate simply, clearly, may be mistaken for a<br>desire to influence people. That's not the case. There is just the<br>description of what is happening here for all of us. Nothing needs to be<br>sold or bought. Can we simply listen and investigate what is being offered<br>for exploration from moment to moment?<br><br>What is the me that gets hurt or flattered, time<br>and time again, the world over? In psychological terms we say that we are<br>identified with ourselves. In spiritual language we say that we are attached<br>to ourselves. What is this ourselves? Is it feeling of myself existing,<br>knowing what I am, having lots of recollections about myself - all the ideas<br>and pictures and feelings about myself strung together in a coherent story?<br>And knowing this story very well - multitudes of memories, some added, some<br>dropped, all interconnected - what I am, how I look, what my abilities and<br>disabilities are, my education, my family, my name, my likes and dislikes,<br>opinions, beliefs, and so on. The identification with all of that, which<br>says, "This is what I am." And the attachment to it, which says, "I can't<br>let go of it."<br><br>Let' s go beyond concepts and look directly into<br>what we mean by them. If one says, "I'm identified with my family name,"<br>what does that mean? Let me give an example. As a growing child I was very<br>much identified with my last name because it was my father's and he was<br>famous, so I was told. I liked to tell others about my father's scientific<br>achievements to garner respect and pleasurable feelings for myself by<br>impressing friends. I felt admiration through other people's eyes. It may<br>not even have been there. It may have been projected. Perhaps some people<br>even felt, "What a bore she is!" On the entrance door to our apartment there<br>was a little polished brass plate with my father's name engraved on it and<br>his titles: "Professor Doctor Phil." The "Phil" impressed me particularly,<br>because I thought it meant that my father was a philosopher, which he was<br>not. I must have had the idea that a philosopher was a particularly imposing<br>personage. So I told some of my friends about it and brought them to look at<br>the little brass sign at the door.<br><br>This is one meaning of identification: enhancing<br>one's sense of self by incorporating ideas about other individuals or<br>groups, or one's possessions, achievements or transgressions, anything, and<br>feeling that all of this is me. Feeling important about oneself generates<br>amazingly addictive energies.<br><br>To give another example from the past: I became very identified with my<br>half-Jewish descent. Not openly in Germany, where I mostly tried to hide it<br>rather than display it, but later on after the war ended, telling people of<br>our family' s fate and finding welcome attention, instant sympathy, and<br>nourishing interest in the story. One can become quite addicted to making<br>the story of one's life impressive to others and to oneself, and feed on the<br>energies aroused by that. And when that sense of identification and<br>attachment is disturbed by someone not buying into it, contesting it, or<br>questioning it altogether, there is sudden insecurity, physical discomfort,<br>anger, fear and hurt.<br><br>Becoming a member of a Zen center and engaging in<br>spiritual practice, I realized one day that I had not been talking about my<br>background in a long while. And now, when somebody brings it up'sometimes an<br>interviewer will ask me to talk about it'it feels like so much bother and<br>effort. Why delve into old memory stuff? I want to talk about listening, the<br>wind, and the birds.<br><br>Are we listening right now? Or are we more<br>interested in identities and stories?<br>We all love stories, don't we? Telling them and<br>hearing them is wonderfully entertaining.<br>At times people wonder why I don't call myself a<br>teacher when I'm so obviously engaged in teaching. Somebody actually brought<br>it up this morning'the projections and the associations aroused in waiting<br>outside the meeting room and then entering nervously with a pounding heart.<br>Do images of teacher and student offer themselves automatically like clothes<br>to put on and roles to play in these clothes? In giving talks and meeting<br>with people the student-teacher imagery does not have to be there; it<br>belongs to a different level of existence. If images do come up, they're in<br>the way, like clouds hiding the sun. Relating without images is the<br>freshest, freest thing in the universe.<br><br>So, what am I and what are you? What are we without<br>images clothing and hiding our true being? It's un-image-inable, isn't it?<br>And yet there's the sound of wind blowing, trees shaking, crows cawing,<br>woodwork creaking, breath flowing without need for any thoughts. Thoughts<br>are grafted on top of what's actually going on right now, and in that<br>grafted world we happen to spend most of our lives.<br><br>Yet every once in awhile, whether one does<br>meditation or not, the real world shines wondrously through everything. How<br>is it when words fall silent? When there is no knowing? When there is no<br>listener and yet there is listening, awaring in utter silence?<br><br>The listening to, the awaring of the me-story is<br>not part of the me. Awareness is not part of that network. The network<br>cannot witness itself. It can think about itself and even change itself,<br>establish new behavior patterns, but it cannot see itself or free itself.<br>There is a whole psychological science called behavior modification that,<br>through reward and punishment, tries to drop undesirable habits and adopt<br>better, more sociable ones. This is not what we're talking about. The<br>seeing, the awaring of the me movement is not part of the me movement.<br><br>A moment during a visit with my parents in<br>Switzerland comes to mind. I had always had a difficult relationship with my<br>mother. I had been afraid of her. She was a very passionate woman with lots<br>of anger, but also love. Once during that visit I saw her standing in the<br>dining room facing me. She was just standing there, and for no known reason<br>I suddenly saw her without the past. There was no image of her, and also no<br>idea of what she saw in me. All that was gone. There was nothing left except<br>pure love for this woman. Such beauty shone out of her. And our relationship<br>changed; there was a new closeness. No one changed it. It just happened.<br><br>Truly seeing is freeing beyond imagination.</div>
