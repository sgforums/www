            <div class='col-md body'>Hi actually this had been in my mind since I first enter NS in 1994 ( I ORDed in 97). At that time I strongly felt that girls should serve NS. I even propose it a number of times but got no reply from the top. Apparently the top did not agree with me. Look at it this way, girls serving NS will increase our manpower! Besides it will be a morale booster for us guys. I still remember in BMT while we doing PT they were a batch of girls who sign on doing their training there too. There being there actually made us felt that the PT was nothing ( Or we thought as we all collasped when we went back) Anyway, being part of Spore, gals should serve their duty in the protection of our country. Any comments? One last thing, maybe this will help solve the problem of ppl marrying late. heee....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So wat if gers realli serve NS? It makes no difference as they are treated nicely and are given lee-way... I speak from experience... during my BMT, my section and bnk has 4 gers who signed on and came for their BMT... they argue with sergeants, shouted at sirs oso nothing happen to them one... punishments were never dealt on them... no pumpings, no chin-ups... even SOC oso clean fatigue and excused some obstacles then I dunnoe wat is the training for? Iz nothing even to gers... I see them clear with ease... no sweat.... even IPPT... their passing timing for 2.4km is 18++min... come on man... they can walk for 4 rounds then run for 2 rounds like tat... they easy easy IPPT GOLD or silver liao... so wat for ask them to serve NS when they go there and do easy stuffs and enjoy and relax?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bad idea...girls in NS = higher defense spending (more camps built, training, equipment etc) = higher taxation = higher cost of living = Singaporeans complaining more often &amp; louder...also an extra 25,000 people plus their parents complaining &amp; bitching every year...so bad idea.<br><br>interestingly in the Israeli Defense force the women serve for 2 yrs and in combat roles too.<br><br>[This message has been edited by mateo (edited 26 April 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the reason why gals do not serve NS is because of tight labour markets in Singapore. With guys doing NS, we are already taking out 25,000 people from the labour force a year, for the duration of 2 - 2.5 yrs. If you get gals to do NS too, our economy is not going to take kindly to that. Besides, what are the marginal benefits of gals serving NS? not much I reckon... ~ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wat is the army for? the basic reason for an army is to defend the country in times of emergency and war. wat matters most is maneuvarability on the battlefield and the ability to do hard labour in a short amt of time. no matter how hard we try to ignore the physical differences between the 2 genders, it is still obvious dat the majority of the female population would weaken a squad A LOT. of course, there r G I Janes out there who do better than most men, but how many can Singapore's limited population provide? American states who tried to infuse the fairer sex into their army already discovered the different standards and such...men tend to do all the work while the ladies r unable to do heavy work like carry boats and such. in this way, the smaller grp of men haf to do double the work. not a very efficient combat unit, i might sae...<br><br>------------------<br>If I had the letters "HRT", I can add "EA" to get a "HEART" or a "U"and get "HURT".

            <div class='col-md body'>Well... glad to get so many comments... each of us have our own views and all ur comments made sense... I do agree that gals seem to get special treatment.... but if they serve NS like us then I do expect the training to be tougher..... coz those gals doing NS now are those regulars... maybe that is why their training is more lax plus the fact that they are small in number... I do believe that gals can help serve NS in roles like Medic, signalers, MPs etc that do not need so much strength..... this will release more manpower for the armed forces.... if Israel can do it I think we can too as our advicers and our system is copied from theirs.... As for labour mkt, I do not really see much effect as the gals now 1/2 of them will go U also... once the system is implemented for 2-3 yrs... the labour mkt will not be affected by it. Eg. those finishing JCs will all go NS and serve NS and ORD at the same time and go U.... so labour mkt only affected for the beginning 2-3 yrs... after that will be back to normal.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>These are my views....towards female NSF's.<br>Firstly....... The training vise. As we know there is two different standards for Male &amp; Females. But the pay they take back will be the same...<br>Does anyone in here thinks that's fair?.<br>Their promotions are even faster than the guys.<br>Second: what happens if your Boss is a Female .... would you take instructions from her?  the most important " Do they have the ability for strong command and control. I am qouting all this cause i know them personnally. I know a few of them as CO's in the Navy...... Just imagine you have to work for these ppl!<br>As for my personnel view.<br>I think that they should be no females in the Armed Forces..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi e10,<br>it seems most countries that have conscripted women into their armed forces have done so in times of national crisis. since the men are constantly needed as infantry to replace those killed in battle, women were usually needed to fill in the less combat intensive roles that the men have vacated.  once the war is over the women are usually demobilised and the armed forces again are an  all male occupation.  Two examples I can  think of are present day Israel surrounded by hostile neighbours &amp; the Soviet Union in World War 2.<br><br>Does anyone know how Israel Defense Force utilise women in combat roles ?<br><br>I read a couple months back In WW2 the Soviets enlisted women as signallers, medics, MPs and in all women anti-aircraft gun units.  There were a couple of all female fighter wings too.  which were usually better than most of their male counterparts.  but since the war is infantry intensive &amp; you can't put women in there, the majority of Soviet women were conscripted into building weopons for the war effort.<br><br>I can't think of any nation that has complusory enlistment for women during peacetime.  It just isn't practical considering women can't be in infantry, arty &amp; armour and they don't have a need for so many medics, nurses, signallers, technicians, MPs etc.<br><br>The countries that have low birth rates &amp; complusory NS like Sweden, Italy, Switzerland  seems to do fine without enlisting women.  I guese its a matter of reorganising the structure of the unit perhaps &amp; getting more high tech weopons.<br><br>[This message has been edited by mateo (edited 28 April 2000).]</div>
