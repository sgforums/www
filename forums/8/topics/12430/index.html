I would like to try out the story with partners since more people can give more ideas. What do you think?<br><br>This story is actually a Part II of another story called "The Third Door of Charlie".<br>During a BMT at Tekong, one Recruit always got tekan by a Officer and then during a Range firing one rainy night, the Recruit fired his M-16 at the Officer out of hatred and killed him . Everyone at the Range was shocked...The Seargeant rushed forward trying to stop the Recruit but was also shot in the body. Then the Recruit placed the M-16 at his chin and blew up his own head, killed himself..<br>Everything went black-out...<br><br>Some moments of darkness passed, the Seargeant woke up and found himself still at the Range lying on the grass, blood on his body and in pain, but everyone was gone and the Range was empty.<br>still in confusion he decide he has to walk back to the Barracks to find out where the rest of them has gone.<br>But along the long way back, he start to see ghostly "things" and the surroundings seem eeriely-different. He seemed to be followed by strange ghostly beings..<br>Eventually he returned to the barracks but there was no one there..and as he searched,  he stumbled through the "Third Door" of Charlie Company and to his horror, he saw the Recruit there, already a mutated living-dead with a large hole in his head and brains flowed out!  Out of sudden the Recruit moved forward and attacked  him....................<br><br>the Seargeant got to fight his hell-way out of all these madness and find out what the hell is going on...<br><br>Have you heard about the story of Charlie's third Door ?  It's a famous ghost story. And my story is using it as a background.<br><br>However,Part I and Part II are totally different characters and different stories.<br><br>[This message has been edited by SilverWings (edited 05 October 2001).]</div>

What is it about? Is it about ghost? [I think it's just a coincidence that part of my story is the same as full metal jacket.]<br><br>In sixth sense, the story is trying to show as if Bruce Willis is still alive. But in "The Third Door of Charlie" story is different. The Seargeant is in a surrounding which is very different -  blood on the road, rusty metals, misty fogs, eerie lights everywhere, strange ghostly creatures can be seen........the surroundings are the same as in real-life Tekong, but it's a scary surrounding of Tekong. From the visual point of view the audience will know either the Seargeant is dead or he is still alive but in another world...<br>The Seargeant is trying to find out where the hell he is and to get out, unlike Bruce Wills who thought he is still alive and living his normal days in a normal world.<br><br>So I am not copying from any of these two movies. If there really are common points, I think it's only coincidental.<br><br>Any comments on this so far?<br><br>So what is OZ ?? What are you doing now ?<br>And what's your collaboration experiences? can tell?<br>And can you tell me your stories as well?<br><br>[This message has been edited by SilverWings (edited 06 October 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've not seen any "thing" from Tekong Camp 1<br>before but i can assure you its one of the most frightening places in any part of singapore. My company ('Bravo' Coy), was abit far from the infamous Charlie Coy 3 Door Bunk. But there are still many cases of unsolved mysteries in Camp 1. Like my bunk has actually a Singapore Flag hanging on Top of the front door. Unexplained Stuffs, so should our comic be something like "Tekong X-files"? The story background sounds also abit like "Phenomenon" by John Trovolta. Ghost stories nowadays are more appreciated in movies than in comics. I feel that its very hard to draw something that is scardy than creating a Scary Moive...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

I have been to the Charlie's Third Door before. The door was in th middle of the bunk, somewhat red in colour. The bunk was totally empty as I can see through the glass windows.<br><br>I still believe if your skills are good, you still can create an atmosphere in the comics that is as good as those in the movies. It's just a matter of skill and time.<br></div>

As well as the canteen aunty and uncle and also the ghosts wont be botak.     <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  hahaha<br><br>Anyway only one story is in Tekong. Part II is in Singapore itself.<br>I will choose to draw either part I or Part II, and I wont do both at the same time if I were to start. Also must ask whether you guys interested.<br>You guys can also contribute ideas as to how the story should progress.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>[This message has been edited by SilverWings (edited 08 October 2001).]</div>
