I live all my life and it's my first time to come across this name.<br>Just tell me whatever you know about this Lilith.<br><br>Anyway, I found on the internet some sites saying that the Bible mentioned about Lilith<br><br>Isaiah 34:14f<br>Wildcats shall meet with hyenas, goat-demons shall call to each other; there too <strong> Lilith </strong>shall reponse,and find a place to rest.<br><br>Another version :<br><br>Isai 34:14 The wild beasts of the desert  shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow ; the screech owl <strong>(Lilith)</strong>also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest.<br><br>BUT in the <strong>TRUE Bible</strong> Isaiah 34:14, the sentence was:<br>"And wild beasts shall meet with hyenas, the satyr shall cry to his fellow; yea, <strong>there shall the night hag alight</strong>, and find for herself a resting place."<br><br>I think Lilith is someone created by Occultist trying to change the content of Bible. I have searched the entire Bible in <a href="http://www.Bible.com" rel="nofollow">www.Bible.com</a>  but there was no Lilith mentioned.<br><br>Anyway, what happen to Lilith in your story ??<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From "Hebrew Myths" by Robert Graves and Raphael Patai:<br><br>Some say the God created man and woman in His own image on the Sixth Day, giving them charge over the world, but that Eve did not yet exist. Now, God had set Adam to name every beast, bird and other living thing. When they passed before him in pairs, male and female, Adam --being already like a twenty-year-old man-- felt jealous of their loves, and though he tried coupling with each female creature in turn, found no satisfaction in the act. He therefore cried: "Every creature but I has a proper mate!" and prayed God would remedy this injustice. [1]<br><br>God then formed Lilith, the first woman, just as He had formed Adam, except that he used filth and sediment instead of pure dust. From Adam's union with this demoness, and with another like her named Naamah, Tubal Cain's sister, sprang Asmodeus and innumerable demons that still plague mankind. Many generations later, Lilith and Naamah came to Solomon's judgement seat, disguised as harlots of Jerusalem. [2]<br><br>Adam and Lilith never found peace together, for when he wished to lie with her, she took offence at the recumbent position he demanded. "Why must I lie beneath you?" she asked. "I also was made from dust, and am therefore your equal." Because Adam tried to compel her obedience by force, Lilith, in a rage, uttered the magic name of God, rose into the air and left him.<br><br>Adam complained to God: "I have been deserted by my helpmeet." God at once sent the angels Senoy, Sansenoy and Semangelof to fetch Lilith back. They found her beside the Red Sea, a region abounding in lascivious demons, to whom she bore 'lilim' at the rate of more than one hundred a day. "Return to Adam without delay," the angels said, "or we will drown you!" Lilith asked: "How can I return to Adam and live like an honest housewife, after my stay beside the Red Sea?" "It will be death to refuse!" they answered. "How can I die," Lilith asked again, "when God has ordered me to take charge of all newborn children: boys up to the eighth day of life, that of circumcision; girls up to the twentieth day. None the less, if ever I see your three names or likenesses displayed in an amulet above a newborn child, I promise to spare it." To this they agreed; but God punished Lilith by making one hundred of her demon children perish daily; [3] and if she could not destroy a human infant, because of the angelic amulet, she would spitefully turn against her own. [4]<br><br>Some say that Lilith ruled as queen in Zmargad, and again in Sheba; and was the demoness who destroyed Job's sons. [5] Yet she escaped the curse of death which overtook Adam, since they had parted long before the Fall. Lilith and Naamah not only strangle infants but also seduce dreaming men, and one of whom, sleeping alone, may become their victim. [6]<br><br>Notes:<br><br>[1] Divergences between the Creation myths of Genesis I and II, which allow Lilith to be presumed as Adam's first mate, result from a careless weaving together of an early Judean and a late priestly tradition. The older version contains the rib incident. Lilith typifies the Anath-worshipping Canaanite women, who were permitted pre-nuptial promiscuity. Time after time the prophets denounced Israelite women for following Canaanite practices; at first, apparently, with the priests' approval -- since their habit of dedicating to God the fees thus earned is expressly forbidden in Deuteronomy XXIII:18. Lilith's flight to the Red Sea recalls the ancient Hebrew view that water attracts demons. "Tortured and rebellious demons" also found safe harbourage in Egypt. Thus Asmodeus, who had strangled Sarah's first six husbands, fled "to the uttermost parts of Egypt" (Tobit VIII:3), when Tobias burned the heart and liver of a fish on their wedding night.<br><br>[2] Lilith's bargain with the angels has its ritual counterpart in an apotropaic {1} rite once performed in many Jewish communities. To protect the newborn child against Lilith --and especially a male, until he could be permanently safeguarded by circumcision-- a ring was drawn with natron, or charcoal, on the wall of the birthroom, and inside it were written the words: "Adam and Eve. Out, Lilith!" Also the names Senoy, Sansenoy and Semangelof (meanings uncertain) were inscribed on the door. If Lilith nevertheless succeeded in approaching the child and fondling him, he would laugh in his sleep. To avert danger, it was held wise to strike the sleeping child's lips with one finger -- whereupon Lilith would vanish.<br><br>[3] 'Lilith' is usually derived from the Babylonian-Assyrian word 'lilitu,' 'a female demon, or wind-spirit' -- one of a triad mentioned in Babylonian spells. But she appears earlier as 'Lillake' on a 2000 BC Sumerian tablet from Ur containing the tale of _Gilgamesh and the Willow Tree_. There she is a demoness dwelling in the trunk of a willow tree tended by the Goddess Inanna (Anath) on the banks of the Euphrates. Popular Hebrew etymology seems to have derived 'Lilith' from 'layil,' 'night'; and she therefore often appears as a hairy night-monster, as she also does in Arabian folklore. Solomon suspected the Queen of Sheba of being Lilith, because she had hairy legs. His judgement on the two harlots is recorded in 1 Kings III:16. According to Isaiah XXXIV:14-15, Lilith dwells among the desolate ruins in the Edomite Desert where satyrs ("se'ir"), reems {2}, pelicans, owls {3}, jackals, ostriches, arrow-snakes and kites {4} keep her company.<br><br></div>

That's what I like if I get to draw comics. You read Akira? Akira as in the B/W comic...not the anime. Or did you read comics like "mother sarah"? Yeah, the drawing might be sort of old but if you look at the Background....it's freaking detailed. That's the kindda standard I like to aquire but....sad to say....I far from that     <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">.<br><br>But I think if you can draw that way...it's gotta be kool!!!! The background will give the kindda atmosphere....the rusting training shed, the expression of surrounding people, the bits and peices of rifle cleaning clothe on the ground, the old and tarnished m16 he's holding, the dark vegetation at the backgound, etc......if you know how to manupulate the point of view, it can be a good comic with a gripping atmosphere...of course, all this is time consuming.<br><br>Why not plot out your characters and show us your stuff     <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>As for the Lilith thingy...I dunno but I've only heard of the lilith story from the comic called "neon genesis evangelion". The anime uses alot of religous stuff and combine them into a big conspiracy.......pretty confusing too....<br><br>Anyway I think the litith thingy is related to hebrew legends.....not part of christianity....<br><br>I registered to sco but didn't join in the conversation     :p</div></blockquote>I have read Akira before. Yes I realized about the background details.<br>Unfortunately I am better in character drawing then in background detailing. Also I realize the importance of background details...it will really give and extra impact to the story.<br><br>And also, to come up with the characters, the complete story has to be up first. If you guys propose another story, do tell me. Preferably 1 book finish.<br>So silenthunter you cant draw with me?<br>Antonii leh? Any comments so far? If not interested, please say so i wont mind one. hehe     <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>[This message has been edited by SilverWings (edited 11 October 2001).]</div>
