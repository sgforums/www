              </blockquote>
              <p><span class="bodytext"> </span></p><blockquote>
              <p>(SINGAPORE)
              Judicial managers of Jurong Technologies Industrial Corp have found
              'questionable' accounting and business practices at the company that
              would significantly impact its finances, the company said last night.</p>
              <p>The managers, Tam Chee Chong and Keoy Soo Earn of Deloitte &amp;
              Touche, 'have forwarded their findings to the regulatory authorities
              for their consideration', according to a brief statement.</p>
              <p>They said they found the questionable 'accounting transactions,
              practices and matters' while reviewing the company's accounts and
              business practices.</p>
              <p>The judicial managers are finalising the
              company's financial statements for FY2008 and taking into account the
              adjustments that will be made arising from the questionable
              transactions, the statement said.</p>
              <p>The release of the full-year
              results have been delayed several times and the latest extension gives
              the company, a contract manufacturer, up till Aug 14 to finalise its
              accounts.</p>
              <p>No other details were given and it is not known if
              the questionable practices are related to 'alleged irregularities' in
              the administration of receivable financing facilities, which the
              company's auditors Ernst &amp; Young uncovered last December.</p>
              <p>Jurong Tech said then that the irregularities would have no 'material
              financial impact to the unaudited results' for the company's third
              quarter to Sept 30, 2008.</p>
              <p>It said that two areas of the balance
              sheet are affected. Trade payables and accruals should have read a
              higher S$111,376,000 instead of S$106,383,000, and amounts due to banks
              should be a lower S$277,708,000 instead of S$282,701,000, the company
              said.</p>
              <p>Mr Tam and Mr Keoy were appointed as judicial managers in
              February after at least seven banks demanded repayments of loans
              amounting to more than US$200 million.</p>
              <p>The banks included
              Rabobank International, Belgian outfit KBC, ABN Amro Bank, Sumitomo
              Mitsui Banking Corporation, United Overseas Bank, OCBC Bank and DBS
              Bank.</p>
              <p>Judicial management happens when a court appoints a
              manager to direct the affairs of a company in trouble. Under Section
              227A of the Companies Act, this can be when a company is unable to pay
              its debts but there is some chance of keeping the business going
              without having to wind it up.</p>
              <p>Jurong Tech's judicial managers
              have been searching for white knights or investors in the company but
              have so far received no firm offer, according to the latest monthly
              updates.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, they have already sold off some of the
              company's assets, including a Tuas factory for S$3.53 million with a
              remaining lease of about 17 years, and unused factory land and building
              in Malaysia for RM3.5 million (S$1.4 million).</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">These are public listed companies. Without the accountants, the fiscal reports cannot be fudged. The ring leaders can't do anything if the accountants say 'no'. That's why they are labelled as 'professionals along with doctors, lawyers and engineers'. </span></p>
              <p>One Enron case and another Worldcom.. why do we even bother to govern these accountants as professionals...</p>
