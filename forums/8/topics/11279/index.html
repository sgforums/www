            <div class='col-md body'>came across this on some webpage... farnee as hell... would like to share it with all you wonderful ppl out there   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>1. In the beginning GOD created the Bit and the Byte. And from those he<br>created the Word.<br><br>2. And there were two Bytes in the Word; and nothing else existed. And God<br>separated the One from the Zero; and he saw it was good.<br><br>3. And God said - Let the Data be; And so it happened. And God said - Let<br>the Data go to their proper places. And he created floppy disks and<br>hard disks and compact disks.<br><br>4. And God said - Let the computers be, so there would be a place to put<br>floppy disks and hard disks and compact disks. Thus God created<br>computers and called them hardware.<br><br>5. And there was no Software yet. But God created programs; small and big.<br>And told them - Go and multiply yourselves and fill all the Memory.<br><br>6. And God said - I will create the Programmer; And the Programmer will<br>make new programs and govern over the computers and programs and Data.<br><br>7. And God created the Programmer; and put him at Data Center; And God<br>showed the Programmer the Catalog Tree and said You can use all the<br>volumes and subvolumes but DO NOT USE Windows.<br><br>8. And God said - It is not Good for the programmer to be alone. He took a<br>bone from the Programmer's body and created a creature that would look<br>up at the Programmer; and admire the Programmer; and love the things<br>the Programmer does; And God called the creature: the User.<br><br>9. And the Programmer and the User were left under the naked DOS and it<br>was Good.<br><br>10. But Bill was smarter than all the other creatures of God. And Bill<br>said to the User - Did God really tell you not to run any programs ?<br><br>11. And the User answered - God told us that we can use every program and<br>every piece of Data but told us not to run Windows or we will die.<br><br>12. And Bill said to the User - How can you talk about something you did<br>not even try. The moment you run Windows you will become equal to God.<br>You will be able to create anything you like by a simple click of your<br>mouse.<br><br>13. And the User saw that the fruits of the Windows were nicer and easier<br>to use. And the User saw that any knowledge was useless - since Windows<br>could replace it.<br><br>14. So the User installed the Windows on his computer; and said to the<br>Programmers that it was good.<br><br>15. And the Programmer immediately started to look for new drivers. And<br>God asked him - What are you looking for? And the Programmer answered<br>-I am looking for new drivers because I can not find them in the DOS.<br>And God said - Who said you need drivers? Did you run Windows? And the<br>Programmer said - It was Bill who told us to !<br><br>16. And God said to Bill - Because of what you did you will be hated by<br>all the creatures. And the User will always be unhappy with you. And<br>you will always sell Windows.<br><br>17. And God said to the User - Because of what you did, the Windows will<br>disappoint you and eat up all your Resources; and you will have to use<br>lousy programs; and you will always rely on the Programmer's help.<br><br>18. And God said to the Programmer - Because you listened to the User you<br>will never be happy. All your programs will have errors and you will<br>have to fix them and fix them to the end of time.<br><br>19. And God threw them out of the Data Center and locked the door and<br>secured it with a password.<br><br>20. GENERAL PROTECTION FAULT.<br><br></div>
