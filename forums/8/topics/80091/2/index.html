            <div class='col-md body'>I think the funeral should be at the national stadium not Istana as the Istana is too small. Also, the body (corpse) can be placed at the centre of the football field so that 60,000 people can see not to mention live telecast on CNA. What's wrong if people donate money for his funeral? Some of you so stingy. Also, his suite should be in red and white not business style. With his death, there should be 3 days of mourning and 3 public holidays. A tomb for him at Sentosa or pulau Ubin would be good. All religious leader to pray at the national stadium, but no fireworks! unless he himself request for it. I'm sure the govt already has appointed a special committee to look into LKY funeral with some special name. Funeral 2005, The LKY burial....or something like that. Any other views?</div>

Without him, Malaysia won't kick us out and we will now be known as Malaysians.  If we are still part of Malaysia, there won't be so many of us having the opportunty to enter the university.

The topic here is about contributing money to his funeral. Gone are the days when people feel afraid to speak about death. Nothing wrong preparing singapore for his demise. It will happen, make no mistake, he is 82 and he himself said he has slowed down. He is old and feeble, his wife had a stroke and may go anytime. I believe if his wife goes first, usually the partner will follow not long after. So the numbskull who said that he is healthy and well is in never-never land. In self denial. LKY is at the door-step of death and there is nothing wrong, if we prepare for that and contribute our hard earnings to buy him a nice coffin. Nowadyas they are selling those kind with half glass, so we can see him for the last time to say goodbye. Doing all this my friend is showing the old man, respect.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>You mean his family is not rich enough to give him the best of whatever he wants? I think even if he spit, its actually birdnest that comes out...<br>Maybe his family should give money to take better care of the poor people who are aging and built the country up together with him. If not for the common man... there's no country. If not for the hardwork and sacrifice of our grandparents and parents, this country would not be what it is today. Its not just one person. Its a collaborative effort.<br><br></div>
