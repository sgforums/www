            <div class='col-md body'>The Nicoll Highway collapse already illustrated that Singapore's geology is not suitable for too many tunnels. Already the CBD has EWL, NSL and NEL tunnels, so building more subway tunnels will only destabilise the ground further. Especially since Nicoll Highway was built on reclaimed land.<br><br>Frankly, I would rather the CCL bypass the CBD altogether and run from BNV to PYL only. It is better off as a suburban line. The CBD is well-served by bus routes.</div>
