              <p>This incident happens in a Local Swimming Club at Tanjong Rhu,<br>The in-house Chinese Restaurant at its 2nd Floor is run by this lady mananger from China.<br><br>(As given by Raymond, the assistant manager, her name is Sammi and she is the manager there and fully in charged)<br><br>Their buffet dinner is priced at $28 / pax , our company booked 29 pax for our annual dinner.<br><br>First their manager (over the phone) insisted that we must order our food in the afternoon because they were "fully booked" and for not doing so,<br>we cannot blame them if they are slow in serving or if they "run out of food". Obviously, my colleague who made the booking did not know<br>what to order as majority of our colleagues were not in the office.<br><br>Reluctantly, she made some order. She was told that we must order at least 3 vegetable dish or "dont blame them if they run out of vegetable"<br>if we do not place the order early. (I suppose vegetable dishes are cheaper in cost). When we arrived, only 25 of us made it, we were told to pay<br>for 29 pax since we booked for it. After some bargaining, it was settled for payment charge by head count. We were being sqeezed into 2 tables instead of 3,<br>she claimed that we do not have enough people to occupy 3 tables.<br><br>After some struggling as the tables were really cramp, we protested. Eventually they agreed to let us have one more table after some unpleasant<br>exchange of remarks and finger pointing (The restaurant manager did most of it and shouted at my colleagues). I had to fill my hunger with the<br>3 balanced dishes served when i arrived late and when we went over to the newly set up table we placed some orders but it takes long time to be served,<br>some dishes didnt make it either out of stock or the order just vanished.<br><br>The table was empty (without food) for at least 20 minutes and i called the assistant manager to remind him of our orders, this was my first experience<br>with buffet dinner where the table is totally empty for such a long time. We were told that they run out of fish and two small plates of prawns which<br>were ordered were finally served. My first experience again, for buffet dinner which ends up feeling hungry. I had a packet of instant noodle when i reach home.<br>They didnt even bother to ask for last order which most if not all restaurant do.<br><br>Then came the last straw where the pushing incident which were recorded for your viewing pleasure. Oh, the manager claimed that we wasted food ,<br>it was her excuse for causing such a ruckus. Her claims were unfounded, how i wish there were an in- house camera that had taken all the events throughout.<br>If the restaurant have one, i will be most happy if they can put it up here for everyone to see how they accuse us of wasting food.<br><br>One point to note is that the restaurant was about half empty at any point of time throughout our patronage, those members and guests happens to be<br>there can verify that. She claimed that we pointed finger at her, can see in the video clips she has been pointing her fingers whiles talking ?<br>Can you trust her statement ?<br><br>Is this kind of service attitude we deserve ?<br>Can we allow this foreigner to tarnish the reputation of Singapore<br>while we are striving for a country with excellence in the service industry. ?<br><br>I hope the owner of the restaurant make a thorough investigation and get to the bottom of this.<br>Please note that all incidents listed are true to the best of my knowledge. For those who are present, please give your account or comments in case<br>i missed out some parts or mislead the readers.I will be glad to amend them after verification.<br><br>email to alvin8228@yahoo.com.sg<br><br>Regards<br>Alvin S C Tan</p>
