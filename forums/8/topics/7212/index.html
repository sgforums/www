            <div class='col-md body'>I fear for Singapore's future.<br><br>This is because the younger generation of Singaporeans no longer have that fighting spirit in them anymore... We have been softened by the 'Good Life'... Too good a life. No more hardships, no more uncertainty, no more will to forge ahead... And most importantly, no purpose, other than those of getting money, enjoying luxury and pursuing quick self-gratifications.<br><br>Young kids no longer go under the rod... parents back up their kid's poor behaviour in school, and blame their kid's failure on others, never themselves. And pampered they are... as we were...<br><br>The world is not a friendly place; Its survival of the fittest, and if we don't do anythong about our people - the building blocks of this nation - we will soon find ourselves rotting from inside!<br><br>[This message has been edited by BluErf (edited 05 May 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agree that the world is an unfriendly place, but I don't think this fact has been lost on the young. Especially in Singapore, even having a comfortable life is not that easy.<br><br>Its so complicated. Education has shifted from discipline with the rod to other means. (I'm assuming that you are using the rod as an example of a harsher, more regimented environment in schools, and conversely, not using it as being a softer approach.) Such is what everyone is doing. Whether or not we think that is better is another thread altogether.<br><br>However, that doesn't result in children or young adults being softer, as qualities like initiative, fighting spirit, resilience etc are not imparted by physical punishment. I don't think so anyway.<br><br>I'm also confident that there are enough parents who are sensible enough to bring up their children properly, to offset those who do not do so.<br><br>You have raised a good point in that parent play a role in bringing up children. Thats obvious I suppose, but it has to be said. So become one of those parents that don't pamper their kids. Provide for a comfortable environment, but stimulate and make them "suffer" in others. These does not have to be mutually exclusive.</div>

We should not be repaying even after we retire.  A taxi driver told me a few wks ago "S'pore only looks good on the outside but actually all these good things are on debt."

            <div class='col-md body'>manhunt, the main problem is because most Singaporean don't dare to speak up. Most Singapoean is willing to accept most of the policy the government made. Those who are daring to speak up mostly ended up in a bad state as most people can see I believe.<br>As you had mention MI185 is one good example.<br><br>Another good example is bus service 96 and 199. Why is it not changed to feeder services? This 2 services is mostly taken by those university student, if the student union are more daring to speak up few years ago, I believe they will not ended up paying so much for this 2 services.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes,like Millenium has mentioned,we just follow what the government gave to us as most of what they implemented are quite good for us in the short,if not,long term.But aren't we just like some sheep following a shepard blindly?The shepards may do things for us of which the majoirty are good,but the shepard is human after all and humans make mistakes,so what can we do if we see that a mistake is being made?Seems to be,we just accept the mistake and comfort ourselves by saying that after all the good things that has happen,a few mistakes is unavoidable.But do we really want to sit back and accept any mistakes done or do we voice our views and hopefully affect some of the government's policies???  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">))</div>
