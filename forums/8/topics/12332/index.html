So that makes u worse than a bloody idiot isn't it?<br><br>Those extremists always think they are terrorising in the names of their Gods, so they think they are so self righteous and they hve the right to cause unhappiness. So, little pinky tried to cheer ppl up, but u flamed her and cause unhappiness, u extremist or what, as displayed by your holier than thou attitude?<br><br>Pinky is a decent little girl as she had cheered many of us in this forum by her constant jokes and riddles as many regulars here will attest to except this time the joke went off colour. Can't a person be allowed to make a mistake, or are u a mean bully having a chance to bully a little girl and u pounced on the opportunity just like those faceless terrorists attacking defenceless ppl?<br><br>At least pinky tried to cheer us up, what hve u done? Issit u sent a few  miserable dollars to the victims and therefore that gives u the right to call ppl scums and bloody idiots? U are behaving like those terrorists aren't u with their god given rights to anyhow bomb ppl? So who is the scum?<br><br>Little pinky had the decency to apologise when ppl told her her joke was out of place, yet like a big bully, u attacked her. She had the decency to apologise, will u apologise or again, just like those terrorist think that u hve the god given right to call ppl bloody idiot even after ppl apologise?<br><br>Anyway, won't expect u to be a gentleman and apologise cos no terrorist has ever apologise but will justify that their actions are right. If u intend to do so, I blur blur tell u, don't bother....because no matter how well your justifications are, hiding behind your computer and attacking a little girl who is only trying to cheer ppl up albeit in wrong taste and the attack is even after an apology makes u no differece from those terrorists bullies!!<br><br>U hve even attacked her on another thread here. I hve talked to her. She said suntec cud be a target becos she got an email from a millitary friend that said so, whether real or not, she posted messasge here to warn ppl to avoid going there in case it is real and she got attacked by you for a good deed. Actually maybe saving pple's life if it is real. Why, u don't like saving lives issit? Then again, aren't bullies always attack good ppl?<br><br>Aren't terrorists, extremists, bullies just like u. Holier than thou, self righteous, pretend to be doing it for the sake of righteousness?<br><br>Tsk tsk, what a shame. A young man like u stooping so low to attack a little girl and trying to teach ppl what to do. No wonder this world gor wars, terrorists etc becos of bullies and intolerant ppl like u!!<br><br>ok, time to blur again  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> DuH<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thankew guyz. I really did receive this message from SMS.<br><br>Anyway, if got ppl think i'm insensitive, they are wrong. I cried and cried when i see ppl falling from the buildings.<br><br>All I wanted to do was just to make the best out of a sad situation.<br><br>Well, that was a mistake. Still I hope and will cast a spell that no more ppl will die becos of bad ppl insisting on making ppl see their point of view no matter the cost, including killing, or flaming and calling names?<br><br>No, i'm not insensitive, if so, why shud i cheer ppl up and get flamed. Yet, i will not retaliate to the ppl that flamed me. we are of a better breed than those that are intolerant like what blur said, so that the world will hve peace. That will be nice won't it?<br><br>Guyz, thankew for ur understanding.<br><br>BTW, i love to see ppl smile and will go on posting riddles and jokes. but den not possible to please all ppl all of the time. otherwise, then i'm not fairy. i will be god won't i?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> sniff sniff, sooooo sad   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>[This message has been edited by pink fairy (edited 16 September 2001).]</div>
