            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all fishos...<br><br><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">Definitely for the subject title may tickle some unknown happenings during your fishing trips which i'm sure some of you do. I had my share of scary experience during my fav hobby. C'mon fishos let's share some knowledge, maybe we might know which place is "dirty" so we can get prepared for it in advance.</span></strong><br><br>Encounter 1<br>Location: SG Sailing Club aka National Sailing Club; Jetty near it<br><br>Fellow fishos should know this place VERY well for some of it's notorious dead at the bridge some decades ago. A triad member killed a police there. My experience of it should i say lucky, i didn't witness the appearance of this entity. Whilst fishing away happily abt 3 yrs back with my cousin and the younger friends, our nasi lemak which we packed from Changi V kept disappearing one by one. Firstly all of us was busy fishing, trying hard to get big game. Lil did we realise the disappearance till some of us got hungry and decided to fill the stomache first. That's when we were surprised that packets of the packed supper was gone, we chuckled as we thought 1 of us played a prank on one another. Now our belongings was placed and situated behind us<br>which we were fishing at the t-junction of the jetty.<br><br>Our back was facing the beach and apparently i do not know the valid reason. On this part of the beach it's extremely dark. Moreover apart from the cars you see further out in the expressway, civilisation is about a few klicks back towards the ECP Macdonalds. Trust me it's really quiet and tranquil if you don't think too much and enjoy the night light to see stars, therefore being in a secluded part of the beach bound to be "happening". Now back to where i stop. Most of us didn't turn our heads back to see whether if there's any people cos we knew there wouldn't be, apart from some batch of commandos marching pass, practically noone was at the beach. As we were fishing, most of us heard someone feasting behind... As one of my cousin's friend is fishing at one of the L corners facing left and behind us. Naturally we thought it's him, he also thought it's one of us. But god dammit, eating and snorting? Sounds hungry i thought smiling to myself. Eventually got hungry like i said and after discovering the food missing and one packet was laid abt a few yards behind our groundsheet. The whole jetty was almost pitch dark with only the night light from the moon and rays from our torch.<br><br>Everyone was still having the thoughts of being punked so all chuckled and called each other jerks. As i went to recover the solitary packet (messy all the rice lying ard) cos it made a mess on the floor and i just wanted to clear it. While bending down and thinking which bugger did it (cousin's friends were still quite young), i heard a very faint snorting sound again. Now but further. I look forward quinting my eyes and headlight which i fitted onto my cap showned straight. Not far but enough to see a trail of rice leading to one of the trees up ahead. Immediately i thought, geez... must be stray dog as a culprit. Looking hard, found the trail went straight a tree and up it... yes up and while trying to understand the situation, the snorting continued softly but kinda ascending which now... goodness, think for that moment suddenly my hair stand. The noise was not loud but definitely audible. Snorting, whining, choking coughs, laughter?... yes suddenly a sudden chuckle like what we did when we thought we're playing a prank on each other. Unmistaken, it's very human laughter and only hyenas can almost imitate how human laughs.<br><br>My reaction was to just pack up and go. Definitely living 20plus years and i do not want anything to happen now, especially with these kids around. Turned back and i already saw them looking my direction, with a frown and worried face. Neither do i want to carry on the explanations as i believed they already knew. I called my cousin over and he realised a serious look on my face, to assist in the packing while the other 3 friends still looking. The haunts of the laughter from some unknown thing, was eerie and it runs deep into our skin. Just in matter of minutes like as if they knew we're going and sniffed fear in us, sprouted another laughter from a bush near the jetty. Goodness the fright was uncomprehenable. Already 2 of the friends are close to tears and i just told them to hug me and close their eyes while we swiftly walked out of there. As i was 1.9m tall and they're all about below my chest level, all hugged me to gain comfort. The most scariest is the part where we past by the tree, can't escape it as the tree was directly at the entrance of the jetty. The laughter and murmurs gives me the chill. Kept on chanting my buddhist lines till i reach the car and drove off.... I didn't even retrieve the rest of the nasi lemak for fear something will dwell in it and comes home with us.<br><br>C'nue with encounter 2 tml... meanwhile you guys share your's?<br><br></div>

Over here, what i would like to bring out is the ghostly encounters that many fishos here in SG also encounter. Talking abt sport or hobby, i'm sure this hobby has the highest chance to encounter unworldly things as fishos are rather adventurous, willing to try out dark spots... just to get big game.<br><br>Secondly, no... i'm too sure monkeys don't snort for sure and how do you explain the laughter? I've been to brunei jungle training during my army years and did camp out in the jungle for 5 days. 5 days of hearing eerie monkeys howl in the night and not for once did they made a sound similar to the one i heard. I tell you it's too distinctive to be mistaken for any animals you would know.<br><br></div>

This situation was back at the lunar ghost month in yr 99. Sincerely, i think both of must be crazy to fish at that month, at that place. We know the place is haunted but for the sake of fishing and embracing the hope of bringing back a stingray pushed us to the sea.<br><br>After fishing for the goddarn night, we only got catfish and more catfish. Too our dismay, seems like what we thought at first wasn't going to be achieved. Then we chit chat thru the night but our heart wasn't really set on fishing, got distracted as we're disappointed with the catch. Went further down the beach to shoreline and kick ard the incoming tide. Abt 30-40 meters infront was a darken stub on the ground. Looks like some kinda of debri swept up by the incoming tide. Curiousity got the beta of 2 of us and we went on to make the discovery, only to find that it looks like a statue of some kind. Size was abt H3ft x W2ft. Still getting curious and wanting to flip it all around to see the 360 of it as lighting again was very insufficient. The only light was coming from our ciggie butts and our lighters. As one of the SOP item for fishos was torchlight, we made a grave mistake by not bringing it. Back to the statue, didn't want to dirty our fingers so we use our foot and slippers on to manuever the piece of debri.<br><br>While turning ard, we quinted thru the dark night light from the sky and confirm it was a statue. Actually we can't see very well and sort of made that hypothesis up. It's only when both of us squated down and light up our lighter, then the shock came to us as we fell back crawling backwards. It's some kinda of idol, definitely don't look like those very "amicable" ones like the "Tu di gong gong"(a chinese idol) or any of the "Ba xian guo hai"(8 immortals, idol). It's face was quite sinister with sharp teeths, easily seen. A crown. Face contorted. It's arm was holding a knife and something else.<br><br>Immediately after backing up alil while seated on beach where we fell... a wave suddenly knocks the statue down and it fell face first into the sand. Upon falling, we could see the back. Half rotten and god gracious, there's a "pool" of maggots crawling behind it, and that's the moment when both of us smell a sweet fragrance. We knew what it was and immediately packed up and go without uttering another word. Drove out of there immediately.<br><br>The next day. I went into high fever, my friend too. Apparently my granny took me to a medium cos my fever didn't go off after a week of constant 40.3 degrees. Lucky i still survive after a week. The medium also gave me a frown when he saw me and murmured some Hakka words to my granny. After drinking a special drink(burnt tailsman with incense ash), surprisingly the suffering ended 1 day later. My friend who's a believer of English medicine, took 2 weeks to recover on doc's medication.<br><br>From that day onwards, i seldom go to this area to fish anymore. Only when there's a bigger crowd.</div>
