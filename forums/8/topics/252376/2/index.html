Got too adventurous and was scared shitless too... lol. Yes, ubin npcc is a TRUE haunting place. Taking pictures there in the night you will see alot of "orbs"...<br><br>Next spot... the quarrys around the island. Scenic and tranquil by day... sinister and ghostly in the night. I can't remember the quarry's name but i remember once we went fishing in the night with a total of 5 pax inclusive of me. Went up the slope and fish there, the bush behind us is about 4 to 5ft away. Yes indeed, more like a small path. The path with scrubs or cliff on both sides.<br><br>Fishing till halfway, a rotting smell came from behind. Very abrupt i tell you, very very suddenly like you smell farts suddenly from your friend. It's too damn smelly and overwhelming to be someone's fart unless, he had eaten god knows what <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> As well the scrubs behind us shook violently like someone shaking it very hard. We left our things there and ran out of the quarry to a small hill over looking it. Stayed there till sunshine and lucky our expensive equipments are still there.<br><br>Else, normal cycling path in ubin can clearly see some unknown tombs. Big and grand back then, now covered with vines and leaves. Quite eerie actually. Oh yes, while back then we used to hang out in Ubin for fishing almost a few times in a month, from folks hearsay who some of them do recognise us, told us... No matter what you hear during your stay in a camp/house in Ubin during the night... never never be too smart to investigate until daylight. I wonder that story was to scared youngsters or abt the tiger incident in Ubin that happened a few yrs ago..</div>

Best place to fish is some beach at Port Stevens which is a few hours drive from Sydney. Can't remember the name of the beach but you'll catch a fish every few minutes no kidding.</div>
