Not to mention that courts very often award custody to the mother (and I don't base this on any medium of mass media either (i.e. true facts)).<br><br>Seek therapy with your wife. You sound like a big successful guy; put your ego (and hers) behind each other and seek out therapy together. It's the best way to resolve differences, find new understanding and it will save you alot of legal/ancillary costs in the long run.<br><br>I'll be happy to put you in touch with competent family law litigators; and contrary to another of my post, will be from a different firm instead (cannot take sides!).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Also, you do realise that you can set up a trust for your son that will be tax-free right? That's an easy way to get the missus off your back; take out policies/long term investments (e.g. consistent buy-ins) that pay out for your retirement. That way, you don't have to be overtly paranoid and worried because the risk profile is usually very low, and you get insurance for yourself, your wife and your kids. If your wife cannot appreciate the stability in your decision, then you ....<br><br>good luck.<br><br>EDIT: Since you have so much liquid cash, just pass an amount to your partner, let her go play forex or do web-based speculation:<br><br>2-fold:<br>1) She realises that speculation is gambling.<br>2) She will find something else to do besides bothering you.<br><br>BTW, with so much cash, I'm guessing you're with some premium divisions of certain banks (or have a p.banker) .. how come your wife still bothers you? Don't you bring her to see your relationship manager ... those guys shd be able to easily help you get her to see straight.<br></div>

After talking to them, I realise their competencies in wealth management is very superficial. No offence, how can I trust a 'fresh graduates' or young rookie to manage my wealth. Most of the time, they cannot answer my query about investment.<br><br>Ok, I think this is my problem that I have to manage myself.<br><br>Thanks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I understand your concerns. Citigold is a fine example of choosing young and beautiful relationship managers to be the public face of that division.<br><br>But don't forget also that the banks don't just hire anyone; usually only the most competent of the graduating cohort gets employed, and of that entire batch that enters the firm on orientation day ... only a few get chosen to be at the frontline, especially for the premium divisions like Citigold where your assets/investments have to be *cough*.<br><br>If they cannot answer your questions, I think they usually call their supervising manager (usually a VP) in ... and he should be able to clear all your concerns and queries. As far as I'm aware, the PS citigold branch always has a senior r'ship manager on standby incase "young and beautiful" does not render satisfactory assistance; besides, you get free parking at PS too!(paragon branch as well)<br><br>Of course, you cannot expect them to answer questions like "do you think I should short sell (insert currency) now?"; their job is only to advise, and beyond that, it's your call and your call only. No bank will provide that kind of service, only p.bankers.<br><br>Anyway good luck! If you really need to let off steam you could always punch her in the face and then say you're sorry  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
