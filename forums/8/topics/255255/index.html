I own a freehold condo opposite east coast and a new car fully paid up. I also own some stocks, FD, foreign currency and cash of about half a million dollar. Both me and my wife work, but I never touch my salary because I don't need to.<br><br>We have zero liability. I thought I suppose to be happy, but I am not. My wife keep nagging me whenever we pass by en-block sale apartments that I should have bought more properties. Whenever newspaper features property price increase, she will complain that I should have bought one. Almost everyday, she complains that I am poor. Stock market bull, she also blame me that I did not invest more. I am really stress out by her. You see, if I can predict future, I will be richer then Bill Gate. I believe in prudent investment and never follow the crowd. But she prefer speculation, and always put all the blame on me for not doing enough. She will take all the credit when things turn out well.<br><br>I am stress just looking at her!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>Wat should I do?</div></blockquote>Gosh! Compare your wife's characters to mine are miles apart.<br><br>My wife is the thrifty one. Prefer to have prudent investment while I like to dabble in stock market. Hardly spend anything on herself. I gave her a substantial allowance and she save a large portion of it and yet have enough left to take care of the household bills efficiently and even have food on the table.<br><br>Is happy with our lifestyle staying in four room HDB in Bishan with our two boys and have no intention of thinking to shift to a bigger apartment. She said no need condo facilities since we also have a club membership. We have two cars though. Mine is the new Lexus while she is driving a three and a half year old Camry. We also have a condo in Serangoon area that was leased out. The rental I got from the rent I turned it over to her and as expected straight goes into the bank account for our two boys' future education.<br><br>Best of all my wife don't nag me about being 'poor' or unambitious(The word 'poor' is very relative. Largely depends on how you perceive it) other than nagging me for not spending weekend with my mother. Not that I don't love my mother just being lazylah.

No unnecessary stress from her to me.<br><br>Should you divorce your wife? I don't think so but it is best to talk to her before things get blown out of proportion.
