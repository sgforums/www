All I sense is you want us to black mouth your wife whom deserves to be deserted or at least silenced, if she is who you tell us she is.<br><br>I am sure most of her friends are not as better off as she is and she jolly well should know your family is probably the best 0.1% of the Singapore population.  Common sense tells me that she should be very proud of you instead of being a source of stress.  I think, therefore, you are the problem.  Excuse my blunt and candid comment.</div></blockquote>well i wld say the problems lies with both of them for not having enough time to understand each other...when most of the couples got in to relationship b4 marrying they are like metal being welded together its hard to seprate them.<br>When they get married they are like magnets that cld stick together strongly but also able to reple each side when not positoned correctly. When married couples have their kid/s its like a piece of material(u nv knw wad it is) between the magnets, the material can make them stick closer or even drop both of them.<br>Problems with lots of couples nowadays has got the same problems...its e.g time, work or  lifestyle that causes it. Alot of couples tot that afer marriage they expect their other half to be like the girl or boy they knw b4 marriage.WRONG all human change as time goes by...its jus that do u spend enough time to understand each other, or to so call follow up each other. No 1 willl remain as the sweet loving girl or boy u knw b4. U must knw how to change with the othe "half" of ur life. Some simple things i do to "look after" my relationship with my wife...ask ur other half "baby hv u eaten?","baby hows ur work today?","baby u want a glass of water?","baby u need a massage?","baby my work is having problems in blah blah blah." There is lots of simple things to do to understand each other better...ask urslf did u ever bother to do thet b4 or didi u tot the "she can get him/herslf a drink if she wants."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously, I think Singaporeans(or people in Singapore) are very money minded. I am not criticizing blindly here. Never have I been to any country where people talk about money so much. Even if u go to the skyscrapercity forum. The singapore's forum will be flooded with investment entries while others will be flooded with what the forum is about...which is about the development of infrastruture.<br><br>I think the government has failed in creating holistic and well rounded people which directly contributes to Letgostress problems.<br><br>Are you close to ur wife's parents? U think they can help? or they might be the ones who are influencing ur wife?<br><br>Ur wife is hinting u that she has wealthier candidates out there?<br><br>I agree with u that money is important although i have said that it is not everything.<br><br>But with ur portfolio, just like i have mentioned too, money is merely numbers in your account. U can easily afford to send ur kids to Ivy leagues w/o any stress. holidays to anywhere staying in 5 stars hotels. and eat in the best restaurants in SG.<br><br>Unless ur wife wants to buy apartments facing Hyde Park in London (more convenient to stay in hotels, plus how many days in a yr u goin to stay there)or fly on private jets which i think are not necessities other than bragging rights.<br><br>Another thing is that ur wife might have frens that are richer ? women tend to compete on frivalous things.<br><br></div>
