            <div class='col-md body'>It has been quite some time since i last set foot on this forum. I can say that this forum is way different from last time. A forum infested with sex crazy kiddos.<br><br>There is forever the debate on the freedom of speech. I say that loansharks painting their masterpieces is a form of expression too but should it be left unreprimanded?<br><br>When i first set sight on this forum, i was given the impression that its the place where freedom of speech is upheld and for intellectual satisfication . Congrats moderators, for freedom or rather the abuse of freedom of speech is clearly in place. Sorry moderators, for intellectual satisfaction is clearly not on the board.<br><br>Freedom of speech must be defended and for the honour of this precious privilege or right, the abuse of it must be eradicated. Last time, debatable topics with sprinkling of undesirable topics which livens the forum is the state. Now.... there are hardly any topics which warrant at least a discussion.<br><br>Come on moderators, i'm sure u guys call yourselves moderators for a reason rite?<br><br>What do u want? A forum with debatable issues or a forum juz for the discussion of sex by some sex crazed kiddos?<br><br>There are ppl who had said something like defending the right of expression of a vulgar inclined kid. Does that mean that u will support ppl who degrades the reputation of some others? Will u uphold his right if someone were to splew crude language at your loved ones, gfs etc.... and splat offensive pictures on the board? Well its time that some educators step out. There are obviously topics which are offensive to some and i'm sure u guys dun want this forum to be relegated to some mouth swearing forums.<br><br>Its time to make a decision and hence a choice.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am just wondering what is a job of a moderator...?And to so called 'chit chat'as in a forum is not some gossip column in the fashion mags...or some 'Coffeeshop talk'...I do hope is that whatever views we expressed here are uncrude..and civilised...everyone's views respected but have ur own stand of thoughts...<br><br>Vulgarities is sinply unpardonable...and it really shows how a person u are..the kind of threads u generate..the jokes u try to make as well as the posts each of us contribute more or less shows our personality...If playing the villian gives one a kick to be on ecstasy..I think rave parties are a better place to get into but not to pollute the forum with it..I dun mean to say by putting some revolting threads mars our innocent mind ... it is just the way one says it...and also it has not become a discussion but a forum of sexual manifestation and visual sexual talks...Oh well...everyone is entitled to say his /her piece...but as usual it is not what you say but how u say...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, Mind :<br><br>I put it clearly that there is nothing wrong with upholding the freedom of speech. There is no need to resort to jumping to the moral highground or use personal attacks on the person for putting up degratory posts like what is a good position for sex or etc.. What I think people who jumped to whichever sides to this freedom of speech issue, defending the people who made those provoking sexual issues, failed to realize that there is a propriety in writing something on this forum. There is a line between writing something sensitive in a sensible and mature way, and writing something sensitive not in a sensible and mature way. This has nothing to do with the person's educational level nor the command of the person's English. It has something to do with the person and his motivation in putting up these posts, whether to provoke or to impress.<br><br>My own opinion is that I am not impressed by these posts. I was more impressed by people who argued properly on sensitive issues in this forum, for example, the thread on "To be or not to be a virgin". For that sensitive issue, I can see the people demostrate a level of maturity which is required to do that. To fake stupidity and use singlish to get away from the accusation that the person is not saying something appropriately, is just someone whom I truly spit on or despise.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the effects of demand and supply will sort this bullshit out. Consider this,<br>if some one writes a topic eg christianity  ... or which sexual positions blah blah blah. If many ppl are interested in the topic (like the biting the arm thread) then many ppl will reply . If no one is interested in the topic, then few ppl will reply and  ppl will use the time to post on other topics which interest them(easy to understand?). Thus an unpopular topic will get swept down to page 2/3/4 of the topics. Come on lets be honnest ,who reads page 2 3 and 4 anyways, thats yesterdays news.<br>So if the topic is unpopular and u find it offensive, then well if other ppl share ur views then the topic wont really be repliled to. If ppl are interested in which is the 'best way to get their nuts off'or which is the 'best religion /does god really exist' topics then they will reply. If the topics are not popular, its yesterdays news.<br>So comming back to the point i dont think moderation is necessary cos more or less i guess all of us are acting as moderators in the sence we as a whole really decide what we want to see and what we cannot be bothered to reply to. Also i think its better this way then everyone gets to have a say to what is accecptable and what isnt instead of a select few moderators deciding for everyone.<br><br>[This message has been edited by blueturbo (edited 06 February 2000).]</div>
