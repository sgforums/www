Mr Chia and his sister, Ms Chia Lee Kheng, were named in a police report that Mr Kuan distributed at the media briefing.<br><br>The police closed the matter without prosecution after completing their investigation.<br><br>The siblings, who were sharing an apartment at the condominium at the time, had told Today last week that the forms were signed on Ms Chia's behalf, with her full knowledge and authorisation, as she had been away at the time.<br><br>Mr Chia served a notice through his lawyer to Mr Kuan the day after the press conference for the latter to apologise publicly, make reparations and undertake to never repeat the comments again, among other things Â— all of which Mr Kuan had not responded to as the deadline drew to a close yesterday.<br><br>Presidential Polls and Petitions<br><br>While some Singaporeans have welcomed the re-election of President S R Nathan, others are disappointed that only one candidate was certified eligible for the polls.<br><br>As a result of the decision from the Presidential Elections Committee (PEC), one person has decided to start an online petition to show support for presidential candidate Andrew Kuan (picture). Mr Harry Yong, who did not respond to an email from Today, had managed to collect about 250 signatures as of press time last night. The petition is calling for 1,000 signatures, although the PEC's decision is final.<br><br>In comparison, the National Kidney Foundation petition drew more than 40,000 people online. It called for the organisation's board and chief executive officer to resign.<br><br>Another online effort initiated this weekend was a cyber voting booth, listing all four presidential candidates who had submitted their applications for eligibility.<br><br>Among the almost 2,000 "votes" cast, Mr Kuan has 55 per cent of the "ballots" while Mr Nathan has 7 per cent. Fifteen percent opted to "spoil their votes".<br></div>
