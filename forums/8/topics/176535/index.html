Amateur anthropologists have found evidence that a King Kong-like creature once inhabited Kerala.<br><br>A giant-sized footprint measuring 3 ft in length has been found in a remote village, 60 kilometers away from Palakkad town in Kerala.<br><br>The "Big foot", as it's being called, anthropologists say belonged to a pre-historic man.<br><br>Going by the size of the footprint, the anthropologists are hazarding a guess that the man was at least 17-feet-tall with a body weight of 400 kilogram making him the largest human form on earth known to man.<br><br>Villagers also discovered a cave, which they believe was home to this giant.<br><br>The cave has some smaller sets of footprints as well and has become a sight of worship for the local villagers.</div>

These guys were quiet. And they were huge. They were coming in for the kill. I was directly in front of them, and as soon as they saw my face, they stopped and disappeared."<br><br>Mystery<br><br>The discovery has baffled scientists. There are three controversial possibilities to explain the origin of the mystery apes:<br>They are a new species of ape<br>They are giant chimpanzees, much larger than any so far recorded, but behave like gorillas<br>They could be hybrids, the product of gorillas mating with chimpanzees.<br>So far, researchers have little to go on, but they now plan to return to northern DR Congo to study the apes further.<br><br>In the meantime, there are fears that unless measures are taken to protect them, poaching could threaten this new group of primates before the mystery of their identity is resolved.<br><br>"This is a lawless area," says Kenyan-based Swiss photographer Karl Ammann, who tipped Ms Williams off about the apes.<br><br>"The government has practically no control over hunting. If we found something interesting it would attract more investment. People would be more interested in conserving it."</div>
