I mean the "normal" family is now a legend. I'm from a single-parent family myself and it's true that love is the most important thing. You can be in a "normal" family but if your parents quarrel all day long, it's best to get them divorced and live with the one you think will make the better parent.<br><br>And if you can't make that choice and if you're mature enough to know that neither care for you, move out  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Sometimes people have kids without realising its meaning. And if you happen to be that mistake, their mistake, just never stop loving yourself and you'd turn out pretty fine  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Jasonnex<br>@ SG-BOYS <a href="http://sgboys.cjb.net" rel="nofollow">http://sgboys.cjb.net</a>  <a href="http://www.sggirls.com/~sgboys" rel="nofollow">http://www.sggirls.com/~sgboys</a><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Atax...so i was right that it was a try too hard show?  I thot as much...just seeing the trailer for the show and the way they talk and act towards each other, I knew right away that no Singaporean could really associate to the show...If the show does well it's because it has a very nice looking and young cast...<br><br>As usual, TCS 5 has taken that if they throw in good looking people, then people will watch the chow(realism and story thrown out)...*sigh*  I'm usually so dissappointed in the shows they produce...even TCS 8 Does better...The graphics are definately better for TCS 8 also... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Just look at how many flop shows they have...VR man...I love B grade movies, but GOD!!!...even I couldn't stand this show...<br><br>U see when they make shows that Singaproeans can associate with, it becomes hugely popular...ie..PCK!!!LOVE THAT SHOW!!!HAR HAR <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> or UOR(under one roof)...:-)Pck still a lot better...:-)<br><br>I think that TCS always tries too hard and don't really know what the audience really wants...just my POV(point of view)...Usually not very original, but I guess they try  maybe they are just too corporate you know...Everyone must go thru the chain of command before anything or any idea gets produced...I think wrong way to do it when Ur dealing with creative medias...  i could be wrong tho...<br><br>Let me know what others think about the show...I'm quite curious about it...:-)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've had a talk with the SPIN website designer and according to him the forthcoming episodes are supposed to be better...<br><br>Hahaha... anyway jux to recall the funniest moments of the first episode, anyone noticed how Juliette's response to Sarah's apparent accusation seemed so fake? It's like she already knew what Sarah's gonna say. Even her pal's criticism of her attempt to get Rodney from Susan was overdone. You know, like Juliette knew what she was trying to say and she cut in and tried to blow up the whole matter?<br><br>Then also, the conversation between Susan and Sarah  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Now that's even faker. Seems to me there and then that Sarah knew what was going on and just feigned dumb. And as for Susan, she went on to say something that was pretty redundant. I mean, we'd all been watching the show and there was really NO NEED for Susan to regurtitate the BBS slander -- like as if the writer had to clarify with the audience what's going on. And when Sarah "heard" it, her reaction was like a big question mark straightaway without even hesitating or contemplating over Sarah's invective accusation. Like I said, the actresses knew their lines and what was going to be said so well that it all becomes so fake when they say them all out. So the scenes were all loosely put together (poor editing job there) and well, it becomes more like a stage play with acts and scenes, with some scenes supposed to last less than 10 seconds and so everything is rushed. The director has really got to inject some sense of continuity and let the pace go naturally, rather than forcing down constraints and eventually giving us a summarised version of the episode that lacks substance.<br><br>Also of course, I asked the SPIN webmaster why didn't they feature local music. The reply, cos TCS is stingy. Now you heard that, and you know why TCS productions always end up flops. They'd rather make a cheap production and get snowballs of ridicule and criticism than to make a more costly one and receive commendations and positive reviews in return. They'd rather play Britney Spears' Baby One More Time than something from our local talents, which we certainly do have in abundance (But kindly leave out that shit cheena song "Celebrate This Moment" which is worse than any Jessica J track in existence. I have no idea why Eric Khoo would ever attempt to make such a classy music video for a song so cheesy it can pasteurise your eardrums on repeated exposure).<br><br>Fortunately, TCS did throw in a couple of alternative cuts, but don't they know local alternative bands can really jam up some truly great tunes as well, which given the right conditions and all, can actually become worldwide hits. TCS just doesn't bother. They think we'd be so impressed with those foreign songs they spun (more than 12 different track snippets get played in that single 20 min episode, all by Western artists). And of course, not a cent is paid to the recording company (cheapo!) 'cos TCS claims it has broadcast rights...<br><br>Well, I do hope the next few episodes will be better. I mean it's only half-an-hour (actually less than that, minus the advertisements)... and at 9:00 pm I can tune in to channel 8 to watch the new Fong Sai Yuk! Anyway, it's commonplace that people who're bad in Chinese or don't understand Chinese would rather sit through Channel 8 than to watch any locally-made English dramas!...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Well, Spin may never be another Under One Roof, and it will never turn out to be Phua Chu Kang the second, but let's just hope it doesn't spin off to the ranks (what ranks?) of Masters Of The Sea and of course Triple Nine, that supposedly hip show that gives an impression that everyone watches it like an obsession but no one I know around me actually does on a regular basis.<br><br>Jasonnex<br>@ SG-BOYS <a href="http://sgboys.cjb.net" rel="nofollow">http://sgboys.cjb.net</a>  <a href="http://www.sggirls.com/~sgboys" rel="nofollow">http://www.sggirls.com/~sgboys</a></div>
