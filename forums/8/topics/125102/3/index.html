Guess most guys prefer girls who are spontaneous and outgoing, rather than those quiet, shy and demure types.<br><br>What i think you should do.. if those guys are definitely not your cup of tea, just let them know how u feel and dont give them any false hope of future development. If they understand, you can still be good friends or even close friends. For those who still persist on or totally cuts off the friendship, either they have already fallen too deep for u already or they are not mature enough, so no point trying to maintain a 'normal' friendship with them.<br><br>If there are some guys who does fit your bill but somehow u have reserves for them or the timing is not right, just politely reject them and tell them you would prefer to remain as frns for the time being.. then give urself more time to access their character, and whether or not they are suitable to be ur bf. Give urself and the other party another chance.<br><br>Hope that helps.<br><br></div>

Or do you believe in love at first sight?<br><br>Feelings are funny, sometimes they don't reconcile with your head and makes you do things that you regret later on. But it's also what makes you human in the first place.<br><br>Sometimes, people choose to take a leap of faith to pursue their happiness and risk whatever they have now and you can't really fault them for this right?<br><br>It's selfish for them to do this to you but at least it's better to be frank about it to you.<br><br>At the end of the day, if both sides are mature enough to handle the issue, I see no reason why the friendship (if you rejected the guy) can't be maintained or even be brought to a higher level now that romance is taken out of the equation completely...</div>

Then u would realise that this guy is interested in you, and so its only a matter of time kinda thing.. u can't order them NOT to like you.<br><br>And u may want to think of it this way. For the guys who told u abt their feelings for u, the fact that they are willing to risk foiling the friendship between the 2 of u, just goes to show how much they are willing to prepare to sarcrifice just to be with you... of cos u may also think of it in another way that the guy dont cherish the friendship at all, so its up to you to judge the guy's character during the 1yr plus friendship that you had, what kind of person he is.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>some guys mistakes friendship as love. this usually happens when a guy gets too comfortable with a girl. if the guy does not keep check, he would think that he is in love. of cos at the same time the girl must not lead him on. must keep telling him that u are not interested.<br><br>i myself have a few close female friends. before i knew and married my wife we would go out alot to shop, hang out, have dinner, fishing etc. but its purely friendship.(now still do just less often)<br><br>to strangers they may think that we are too close to be just friends but that just the way we are. they are attached and so am i but we just enjoy each others company.<br><br>i believe that this situation will happen to some girls too where they get too close to a guy and think they fall for a guy.<br><br>so i guess i will depends alot on the maturity in thinking of both parties.</div>
