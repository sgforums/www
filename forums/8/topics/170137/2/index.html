            <div class='col-md body'>many things taken granted here cannot be taken the same in malaysia and most country.<br><br>I have been to JB a few times a year.  Each time, i use carefully choosen route and avoid certain lonely places.   Do not dress like a sloppy singaporean with , burmudas and t shirts with the kinds of bags only can find in singapore.  The malaysia JB criminals can spot you 100 metres or the moment you get off the bus at custom.  Also no need to speak, open mouth they know you singaporeans.<br><br>Do not hang too long around shops outside of city square especially near the custom.  if encounter any robbery situation do not resist, run like hell right inside to the police station.  I am sure that is the first place singaporeans must know.  DO not expect the police to do miracles, they are just as helpless on solving such crimes and prepare some bribe money.   its their style.    Most criminals usually chinese operate in gangs and gangster style and can be violent and they use extortion tactics.  They target chinese only.<br><br>The risk there is ten times higher than in singapore.    For ladies or teenagers, it can be very dangerous as extortion and kidnap and sex crime there is relatively high even for malaysian.  and bring an crime alarm just in case.  The best is just think that the north is an open sea, and avoid all together.   and fly direct to bangkok or HK.<br><br>Getting extorted by gangs there in broad daylight , its even worse than snatch theft.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok I have the right to talk on this issue because I am a Malaysian and my hometown is in KL.<br><br>People who say that Malaysia is not dangerous, especially Malaysians who say so, are ill-informed. Just because you have not yet encountered a case, doesn't mean it won't happen. It's a matter of possibilities. The possibilities that you will be a victim of a crime in Malaysia is 100 times that of in Singapore.<br><br>If you are a Malaysian, don't you ever read our newspapers (Nanyang Siangpao, The Star, New Straits Times, Sinchew Jit Poh)? How can you deny that Malaysia is fast becoming a very unsafe place? Unless you don't read news.<br><br>In Singapore, you or even your daughter can walk on the street at 12 o'clock midnight alone and no one will bother you. You go and do that in Malaysia and chances are good that you will be somebody else's target.<br><br>In Singapore, home burglaries mean cases where one thief steal something from a house while the tenants are asleep. In Malaysia, that's not home burglary. Home burglary in Malaysia is where a gang of 4 robbers pry open your back door, use the gas tank in your kitchen to knock down your master bedroom door, slashes you with the knife first and then put the knife on your neck and demand that you hand over all your money/jewellery hidden anywhere in your house. If you have a daughter or a young wife, it gets worse. Even if you install the most solid door to your house, they will still enter your house from the roof (2 or even 3 stories high terrace house). If your neighbour happens to be alert and calls the police for you, most probably the police will arrive after the robbers are gone and all harm have been done.<br><br>If you don't believe, try this next time you go into Malaysia. Look at all the houses (most are terrace houses). Look at the windows and doors. What is the main difference with windows and doors of Singapore houses? It's the iron grill. 99.9% of houses in Malaysia have iron grills installed for all windows and doors. And we are not talking about decorative pvssy grills, we are talking about grills that resemble a jail. Hopefully to protect the people inside.<br><br>In KL when a minor car accident happens, especially if your car is knocked by another car , don't simply get out of your vehicle immediately. Look at the other car. If you see only males in that car, chances are they purposely created the accident. They do so because of several reasons: 1)best reason for you is that they like your car and just want to hijack you car. 2)worst reason for you is that you are a female and they want to hijack you together with your car.<br><br>In KL if you have a factory and is being robbed in the night, it means a gang of 10-20 robbers will arrive with their large lorries and lifting-equipments and start unloading your factory. If you call the police, the police will give all sorts of reasons to delay you ("not my jurisdiction", "call another police station", "are you sure?", "ok we will check when we have time", etc) and then you can bet that the police will arrive about 30 minutes after the robbers are gone. Why? Because they are all together in this. That's your police in Malaysia.<br><br>And it is because that the police is so undependable for protecting and saving you, that makes the situation much worse. In Singapore, if you get into trouble, you can summon the police and they will arrive in 5-10 minutes. That is what I call added security in life. In Malaysia, please fend for yourself. No police is going to help you when something happens. Police will only clean up the mess later and show up in droves for the reporters to take photographs the next morning. If the case is quite severe (more than 1 death and very dramatic), maybe a high ranking officer will show up for the purpose of being interviewed by reporters.<br><br>Malaysian, please don't feel offended or ashamed when these things are discussed. It's the truth, no point hiding it or trying to make it look less severe. At the end of the day, we have to live there and bear with it. So please face the facts and take precautions to protect ourselves instead of trying to ignore it. Well of course if you stay in remote small towns the situation is much better. But try to avoid big towns like KL, JB, Penang, Ipoh, etc.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From my own personal experience i think Malaysia is really a place where dangers lurk everywhere. Polices there are no doubt useless and corrupted. I still remember we ( my uncles cousins and me) had a fight with a group of 10+ malays in their 20s . The reason? Simple and ridiculous, they say chinese should not be in their so call turf. We fought and and we are lucky to survive for there isn't any weapon used and thank god my cousin and his huge motorbike gangs witnessed this incident and came to our rescue. It was my most terrible experience in malaysia and i cant imagine how would it be like if someone were to point a gun at you and make unreasonable demands. I am sure you guys have read newspapers about rape and robbery cases happening to couples who walked in a dark lonely street. Not only malaysia is a place prone to crimes but it is also a place where spirits roam and a place where black magic exists.......<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by zhaozhilong:</div><div class="quote_body">Ok I have the right to talk on this issue because I am a Malaysian and my hometown is in KL.<br><br>People who say that Malaysia is not dangerous, especially Malaysians who say so, are ill-informed. Just because you have not yet encountered a case, doesn't mean it won't happen. It's a matter of possibilities. The possibilities that you will be a victim of a crime in Malaysia is 100 times that of in Singapore.<br><br>If you are a Malaysian, don't you ever read our newspapers (Nanyang Siangpao, The Star, New Straits Times, Sinchew Jit Poh)? How can you deny that Malaysia is fast becoming a very unsafe place? Unless you don't read news.<br><br>In Singapore, you or even your daughter can walk on the street at 12 o'clock midnight alone and no one will bother you. You go and do that in Malaysia and chances are good that you will be somebody else's target.<br><br>In Singapore, home burglaries mean cases where one thief steal something from a house while the tenants are asleep. In Malaysia, that's not home burglary. Home burglary in Malaysia is where a gang of 4 robbers pry open your back door, use the gas tank in your kitchen to knock down your master bedroom door, slashes you with the knife first and then put the knife on your neck and demand that you hand over all your money/jewellery hidden anywhere in your house. If you have a daughter or a young wife, it gets worse. Even if you install the most solid door to your house, they will still enter your house from the roof (2 or even 3 stories high terrace house). If your neighbour happens to be alert and calls the police for you, most probably the police will arrive after the robbers are gone and all harm have been done.<br><br>If you don't believe, try this next time you go into Malaysia. Look at all the houses (most are terrace houses). Look at the windows and doors. What is the main difference with windows and doors of Singapore houses? It's the iron grill. 99.9% of houses in Malaysia have iron grills installed for all windows and doors. And we are not talking about decorative pvssy grills, we are talking about grills that resemble a jail. Hopefully to protect the people inside.<br><br>In KL when a minor car accident happens, especially if your car is knocked by another car , don't simply get out of your vehicle immediately. Look at the other car. If you see only males in that car, chances are they purposely created the accident. They do so because of several reasons: 1)best reason for you is that they like your car and just want to hijack you car. 2)worst reason for you is that you are a female and they want to hijack you together with your car.<br><br>In KL if you have a factory and is being robbed in the night, it means a gang of 10-20 robbers will arrive with their large lorries and lifting-equipments and start unloading your factory. If you call the police, the police will give all sorts of reasons to delay you ("not my jurisdiction", "call another police station", "are you sure?", "ok we will check when we have time", etc) and then you can bet that the police will arrive about 30 minutes after the robbers are gone. Why? Because they are all together in this. That's your police in Malaysia.<br><br>And it is because that the police is so undependable for protecting and saving you, that makes the situation much worse. In Singapore, if you get into trouble, you can summon the police and they will arrive in 5-10 minutes. That is what I call added security in life. In Malaysia, please fend for yourself. No police is going to help you when something happens. Police will only clean up the mess later and show up in droves for the reporters to take photographs the next morning. If the case is quite severe (more than 1 death and very dramatic), maybe a high ranking officer will show up for the purpose of being interviewed by reporters.<br><br>Malaysian, please don't feel offended or ashamed when these things are discussed. It's the truth, no point hiding it or trying to make it look less severe. At the end of the day, we have to live there and bear with it. So please face the facts and take precautions to protect ourselves instead of trying to ignore it. Well of course if you stay in remote small towns the situation is much better. But try to avoid big towns like KL, JB, Penang, Ipoh, etc.<br><br></div></blockquote>It is confirmed. M'sia is indeed a very dangerous country to step into. And these low life losers from M'sia are also creeping into our country to slaughter us. Remember Took Leng How? I hope Bush has his army ready.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
