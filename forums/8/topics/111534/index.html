If yes, then the certain government must be thinking that the education systems and schools are not up to the mark. This further leads to the question that why should the poor citizens pay ever increasing tertiary education fees when the certain government consider it not up to the mark?<br><br>Disclaimer:<br>The above was mentioned as healthy discussion material and the author has no intention of flaming any governments.<br><br>Support:<br>Free speech on the Internet.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>foreign does not = talent<br><br>imo, there is more to this that purely importing 'talents'. sadly the people encouraging the 'imports' do not see or choose not to see how their own local peeps feel about their 'pro-import' policies. i do support the 'import' of talented, civilized and industrious people as they bring new ideas  and maybe even, new businesses to our country. but mass imports of any 'tom, harry, dick' is making the local pple feel threatened and definately not appreciated for what they have contributed to the country. most of these 'tom, harry, dick' are just using our country as a stop over to US or UK, no respect to our country/culture watsoever and you see them reaping the benefits of our forefathers' sweat and blood.<br><br>strangely, these 'pro-imports' policy makers are the same people who chastised their own when these very people decide to be a 'export' to other countries. weird eh?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Foreign Talent are people who brings with them vast experience and knowledge... They are not necessarily smarter than locals, but they bring over a different dimension to the workforce, and places a challenge to locals who are equally capable if not better... With challenge, we are more likely to improve which in term will boost S'pore economy... Yes it is true that they are snatching away our jobs, but Foreign Talents are expatriates who are have carefully picked to filled up important roles. Knowledge-wise, some locals may be on par with them, if not better. But what they have is the X-factor, the experience that many locals would yearn to have. Foreign Talents are not juz any ang mohs picked based on their skin colour.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Fact is - during the good old days - MIW to promote more companies to come to Singapore decided that since we already have full employment, we will let in a stream of FTs or FWs from Malaysia to fill in the lack of workers, be it managers or low-skilled workers.<br><br>Then the property boom started, asset enchancement policy and Swiss standard of living, etc came about to boost the image of the PAP.<br><br>Then the MIW saw that all was good.<br><br>To create a second round of boom, they started encouraging companies from all over the world be it IT, biomed, you name it and these MNCs came and saw that all was good. They want certain conditions - to bring in their own people "if" there are insufficent managers or workers here to fill the gap.<br><br>MIW thought because of their helicopter vision, things will ride on and on in the same way and decided to allow FTs, from China, India, etc.<br><br>But "good flower never always boom" things came to a head and that is the story. Make promise cannot back out. If MIW implement a Singaporean first policy, we all die as all the MNCs will move out faster than they are now to Shanghai or BKK.<br><br>MIW are just praying for time to get their act together. That is why while the times are still OK, they will squeeze every drop of blood from the people - because they know that they need the buffer to see us through when things get really rough.<br><br>These savings are used to spread the external wing so that even if things get tough, supporters of MIWs will still get good paying jobs but out of Singapore.<br><br>For the peasants, they will get enough not to starve to death. By means of mortaging their homes, slow in paying out the CPF.. etc.., we will not starve , this I guarantee. But we will not have a good life as promised by Goh, the Swiss standard of living.</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Now in NUS and NTU, the number of foreign students from China, India, and parts of indo-china is increasing and increasing. These people have lower demands, if they can make SGD1000 and send home it is equivalent to what they can made a few times or tens of times or even hundreds of times if they work back home.<br><br>These people are not stupid, they won't grow roots here, everyone can see it, but the relevant authorities either choose to ignore it, or it's the new emperor's clothings syndrome.<br><br>And the good thing for them is, they are under scholarship here, so as part of the package, they are unlikely to end up jobless after they graduate. Most of these people eventually gets absorbed into NUS or NTU staffing as well.<br><br>Its really a shame, most of these scholar graduates can't even speak decent english, and some of them end up teaching our undergrads. The situation is getting bleaker and bleaker.<br><br>Worse of all, these scholars are not assimilating into our society. They stick among themselves. So what's the point of having them? Eventually, if war comes to Singapore, these people will be the first to run, no doubt about it.<br><br>Its really really stupid. Imagine, every year, more and more local students cannot enter Uni, and have to pay more money to study at private institutions that are owned by foreign unis. And yet, our tax payer's money is used to finance other country's third rate scholars who are rejects in their own countries.<br><br>I doubt we can find a more stupid education policy in any part of this planet. Another thing is, if those China scholars are really so fantastic, why did they choose to come here and why are they not taken by the top ranking unis in US, UK and Europe? It's because they are not the best. Only this country is stupid enough to take in these third and fourth rate scholars.<br><br>Why are we continuing to support such hopeless and nobody want *talents*? A very good example of the failure FT policy is to look at our foreign badminton and Table-tennis players. After so much money has been dump on them, what have they produced? Zilch man, till today, have they won a tournament that we can really be proud of? None.</strong></div>
