            <div class='col-md body'>Recently I did something very idiotic, I confess to someone I love that I feel hurt while doing something for her. That love is painful and I wish someone would dig out my heart so that it would stop the ache. That I thought of giving her the thing I done and leave her. I wrote her a letter telling her all these. It was written on the spur of the moment. Actually I had waited outside her house for 6 hours till 1am, then I decided to go back after a stranger persuade me to leave. It was my fault in waiting for her, coz I didn't check with her if she would be around. I wanted badly to give it to her personally. She was really happy to receive it, but after reading what I wrote to her, everything just crashed.  She told me she understand how I feel and she do not want to be the source of my hurt. She do not want to be a burden to me. That I am very unsure of myself. From the bottom of my heart, I do love her deeply, but sometimes, I just can't control myself and do some stupid things, hurting myself in the process. I guess I deserve it but the last straw is when I confess to her my hurt feeling. I knew something like this might happen, that she will be hurt if she knows, and yet I have to let her know. The last thing I want is to hurt her and yet I just did it. I felt like a bastard.<br><br>If only I could turn back time, I would not have done what I done. All is too late, now she want me to take some time out and think on my own. I had lost the inspiration in my life, the source of my joy.<br><br>After doing some soul searching, I found myself, a rational self, and I knew what I want, it's her.<br><br>I learnt that love is not everything in a relationship. It include love, care, concern, patient, understanding and communication. The hardest to achieve is understanding, misunderstanding is one major source of breakup, and to learn this part might require a life time effort. Yet it's a magical thing, something like research, knowing something new, and it's all the better becoz you are learning about someone you love. It's becoz I do not understand her which causes me to feel hurt.<br><br>I will do what I can to convince her that I had sort out my thoughts, and I am certain of my feeling for her. I want her to be my one and only love.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, if you are someone (dunno about you Luf) with no experience in relationship, you can easily spoil a potential relationship unintentionally. And that's one of the reason why I will only choose girls who have relationship experience to be my gf hahaha  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Girls like to feel comfortable when they are with you. If they find you "sensitive" and easily "hurt" by the things they do and say, even without them knowing it, it can be quite a pressure on them. And they will feel uncomfortable with you cos they are not at ease. They have to be very careful with the things they do and say to prevent you from being hurt. Know what i mean ? They like to have some space for them to make mistakes so you got to be tolerant and guide them slowly if necessary instead of bursting out all your sorrows.<br><br>Well, it is good to know who you like but it is not too adviable to "focus" all your attention on her and say "i am going to make her my one and only". YOu are going to put a lot of pressure on yourself and on her too. And pressure is never welcomed in a relationship.<br><br>We have plans for our lives, but Heaven has planned somethings for us too. Sometimes, it is good to let Heaven surprise us  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good luck !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Littleman,<br>Thanx for your advice, yes I am still a novice when it come to relationship. I had tried hard to love her, and to try to win her heart. Progress was good, but didn't realise that by telling my sorrows to her would caused her to feel sorry.<br><br>I know that some of the things I done will only cause her to be more pressurized, but I still did them anyway. I had wanted her to know how I know, maybe I had subconciously wanted her to feel bad herself. Now I feel I was foolish to do them. Love should be mutual, it should not be built on one's sadness. She is right, I need to cool down, I need time off to think. How can I carry on with her without me getting hurt. If I can't convince myself I won't get hurt loving her, how can I convince her? Got any idea how to cool down.. just felt like working myself out since I enjoy my job. It thou sounds a bit unhealthy.</div>

What you can do now is to get a grip of yourself, and just let things happen.  Things have a way of working itselves out.<br><br>If you are meant to be w/ her then in time you will, if not there is nothing you can do...I have learned it the hard way...<br><br>------------------<br>Float like a butterfly...Sting like a bee...</div>

If only I can go back to Europe to backpack.. that would have been something to keep me happy. The feeling of sleeping in train stations, eating bread and milk by the roadside.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm luf, now i know what happened..<br><br>i dont think you made a wrong move in telling her that you were hurt in doing what you did for her. i believe in sharing your feelings with your significant other half. this is a two-way relationship. you cant keep on sacrificing yourself for her... she needs to know how much you are doing for her and how you feel. think this way. if she has been doing a lot of things for you, and she feels hurt while doing them, will you want her to share her feelings with you? i will....<br><br>in a relationship you should be providing mutual support. i can understand her guilt for having put you through all these... but right now, she knows how much you have done and wat you are willing to do.. so it is a good start for you two.. and you mentioned that you know it is her that you want right? you should be happy that you know..<br><br>actually luf, how do you love someone without risking hurting yourself?? love begets love.. or hurt at times.. give it all you have and leave no room for regrets.. the two of you are bound to hurt each other at times.. but isnt that going to make you want to make up for all the hurt even more?<br><br>------------------<br>You are my first star at night, I'd be lost in space without you<br>I'll never lose my faith in you,<br>How will I ever get to heaven if I do</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Twinkle..<br>Thanx for going thru my thread and giving your views and encouragement. In the short term, what I had done might cause hurt for both of us, but in the long term, it might be something good.<br><br>To love someone without hurting yourself is not easy to achieve. You might want that but subconsciously, you might still do things that hurt yourself. I think it's all in your mindset, how you can calm down and think about things. Another thing is not to do foolish things on impulse, usually such things will cause more harm than good. Come to think of it, it's not possible to have a relationship without hurting each other once a while. It's all part of learning together, what matters should be how you recover and learn from it. Be positive.</div>
