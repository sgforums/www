Just look at France at '02. Who would have guessed they were knocked out in the very first round without even scoring a single goal? and heck, did anyone expect Korea, the co host of '02 WC and considered a minnow in the footballing world could all the way to reach the semi-final(not sure abt tis) beating the like of Italy along the way? What they had is a big heart and determination to play good football.<br><br>Liverpool has by it's standards definitely not considered a second rate football club. It's rich history of honors in Europe and in England are all for everyone to see. A record of 18 League Champions, four times European Cup Winners(The oni English team to achieved that) speaks for itself.<br><br>I, for one sometimes labeled Man United as Mun Yoo but deep down I have mutual respect for them. Likewise for Everton.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>just as baseline brought up.. as must as we show contempt for man utd's (occasionally i call the manure).. we acknowledge that both arsenal and them are very strong teams..<br><br>if i got facts right, fergie joined man u in 1987.. he nearly got sacked in 1990 becos of his major revamp and selling of popular players and not achieving expected results.. it was only in 1993 that man u took the premiership crown with the arrival of the great cantona..<br><br>houllier on the other hand arrived into the epl in 1998 on joint managerialship with roy evans.. but by 2001, he won 5 cups for liverpool which by no means is a small feat.. he's now in the 5th year, of which interuppted by heart problems.. i think he has achieved much with liverpool.. we are only having an underperformed season..<br><br>as for everton,........... david moyes has done a tremendous work... let's see what they can do next season...</div>
