Nothing in this world is worth everything in the world.  Go figure  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Done that once...went to Boat Quay with friends for drinks and ended up drunk and unfortunately, very much alone (told my friends that I wanted to be alone).  Asked myself then just how much do I love M (from my thread)...did something silly...kinda challenge myself that if I could walk back home from BQ to Hougang, I would wait a couple of years more for M.  And yeah, I did managed to walk home.  And I waited for a few years.<br><br>It's not good enough that you believe she will keep her words.  What is more important is that do you think can cope if end of the day, she tells you that "hey cutecuteboy thanks for waiting and loving me all these while but I am sorry we can't be together".<br><br>I believe you are still young and can still afford to waitout for your ex.  The most important thing is to be true to yourself and never allow yourself to be hurted beyond your breaking point.<br><br>Wait if you have to.  But reality bites and reality is no fairytale.</div>

Isn't that good to be with you now? you can teach her, and give her happiness.<br><br>I got an idea...<br><br>You can try date her out again. maybe somewhere where you first met her, somewhere with nice melody and scene like high class resturant. Buy her 2 teddy bears. (make sure it is 2) with the combination of the sweet melody music produced by the cafe or resturant, hand the bears to her. and tell her: the bear will be lonely without a partner. and tell her about the old memories and time both of you spent together. Just hit her heart, and she will come back to your side. Last of all, tell her that you really love her, you want to be together with her all the time.<br><br>Think about it. Isn't it ironic??? you parted with her, and after 3 years the chances of you to make up with her is 25%. You can believe her because you trust her. But remember, time can make a person change. sooner or later, she will met someone better than you and ..........<br><br>You decide.</div>
