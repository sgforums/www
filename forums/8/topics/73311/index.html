            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Phatbot can create networks of remotely controlled computers to take part in online attacks on websites<br><br>A NEW malicious computer program has been detected.</strong><br><br>It can create networks of remotely controlled computers to take part in online attacks, send junk e-mail messages as spam and engage in other shady activities common to the bad neighbourhoods of cyberspace.<br><br>The new program, known as 'phatbot' or 'polybot', uses technology like that developed for file-sharing networks like Gnutella and KaZaa to control the machines. ('Bot' is shorthand for 'software robot', a term generally applied to automated software.)<br><br>Once the program has made its way onto a victim's computer, it spreads across networks and searches for passwords that are stored on hard drives and are passing across local networks.<br><br>It also disables anti-virus programs and systems for upgrading software security.<br><br>Phatbot, which is technically known as a computer worm, was considered novel enough that the Department of Homeland Security in the United States asked a group of computer analysts last week to examine and monitor it, said Mr Donald Tighe, a spokesman for the department.<br><br>The phatbot program, which was detected by security researchers, was described in an article on the website of The Washington Post on Wednesday morning.<br><br>Mr Craig Schmugar, virus research manager with Network Associates, a computer security company, said his company currently rates phatbot a 'low risk', because it has not spread as widely as recent worms, like MyDoom, Netsky and Bagle.<br><br>However, he added that 'the potential for this one is huge' because it can spread in many ways and performs many surreptitious functions on the machines.<br><br>Mr Joe Stewart, senior security researcher at LURHQ Corp, a company that manages security services for businesses, expressed some surprise over the attention the program has received from the government and anti-virus researchers.<br><br>'It's got extra features that make it a little bit more formidable, but it's certainly not a quantum leap in bot technology,' said Mr Stewart, who published a detailed analysis of the new program on his company's website, www.lurhq.com.<br><br>Phatbot is a variant of an earlier program known as agobot or gaobot.<br><br>It takes advantage of security flaws in Microsoft Windows operating systems that have been exploited by recent Internet viruses such as MyDoom.<br><br>Previous bot programs have commandeered large networks of machines.<br><br>They have then used them to anonymously send spam, advertise pornographic websites and launch online attacks that block access to websites.<br><br>Phatbot is one of a more recent wave that uses technology developed for file-sharing networks.<br><br>Earlier programs used a technology for instant online messages called Internet Relay Chat to accomplish the same ends.<br><br>Mr Stewart said research showed the program will create networks of as many as 50 computers, far smaller than the networks usually assembled to launch massive attacks on particular websites.<br><br>He said it is likely the purpose of these networks, therefore, is to send spam without being detected and without having to pay an Internet service provider.<br><br>Any computer that is infected with the new program is probably also burdened with other malicious software, said Mr Stewart.<br><br>In that case, he added: 'You've got a lot more to worry about than this.' -- New York Times<br></div>
