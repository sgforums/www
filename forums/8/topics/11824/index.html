At least it's true for the girls around me. Dunno why but it's been so true.<br></strong><br>And I USED to think that HUMANs are AS*HOLES simply because MY LIFE was filled with 'holes'..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> My 'life savior' for this one...?? ~DRUM ROLL...~ MATHEMATICS... :p THINK..<span style="font-style: italic;"> STATISTICS...</span> Heard of SAMPLING before...? Hmm... Think about how BIG this world is.... Then think about the POPULATION.... Ok ok... Just think about the POPULATION is Singapore.... Think about... How <span style="font-style: italic;">small</span> you are...?? How many percent of the population do you think you KNOW...? CLAIM that you have a WIDE CIRCLE of 'friends'...? FINE... Think about how well you know them then...? TIME needed to know more people IS INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL to the TIME needed to know them BETTER.... In simpler terms, the more time you spend on expanding your field the LESS TIME you'll have for your CROPs lah... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> (KEYI, this is ALSO for you.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">)<br><strong><br>Today's newspaper the Headline was "Girl forced by boyfriend to sell her body for prostitution".<br>I was still wondering why that stupid girl wanted to do that for her boyfriend.<br>And this is not the only example....you can see such news almost everytime...</strong><br>RIGHT.... ACTUALLY.... Do you believe in the TV...? How about ADVERTISEMENTS on the TV...? YES? NO...? KPO me reminds you that <span style="font-style: italic;">newspaper</span> is also a FORM of MEDIA... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> And a very effective one too... If you keep your eyes WIDE OPEN perhaps you'll just understand what I'm saying here one day...? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Besides.... These stories are EVEN MORE LOUSY than trusting your OWN 'SAMPLING'.... Those are just materials that people have chosen to present to you... Just like 'stamps' they stick over your eyes.... Just like the fruit seller or choose to arrange his nice oranges on top to cover up the rest.... Just like... Hehheh.... Your 'pretty girls'....? :p:p &lt;- No offence girls! Not referring to all of ya!! ~OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT..~ NO MORE FLIRTING FOR ME FROM TOMORROW ONWARDS... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">`~~<strong><br><br>Sigh~~...Girls really dont know what's good for them.

IF you look at how poor sausage's friend has suffered.... YOUR SENTENCE would be so TRUE.... PROVIDED that his story is TRUE...
