              </p><p>I propose to have lift buttons outside of every floor for the lifts. Though visually slightly less pleasing to the eye, it would save a significant amount of time spent in the lift whilst maximising the use of waiting time for the lift.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The estimated time saved per trip is 100 seconds for 10 persons. Supposedly a company of 1000 people, takes on an average 4 trips in the elevator a day, it would be 4000 trips. Thus the amount of time saved would be 4000*100 seconds = 400,000 seconds or 111.11 man hours. It has significant impact as the first 3 trips include reaching to work going and returning for lunch on time, which affects productivity. The last trip means going home early leads to having more time spent with family and being rested.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There might be security risk involving non-staff entering the lift without tapping the staff pass, but there is little difference in whether to tap the staff pass outside or inside the lift. For instance when one is inside the life, a staff may tap the pass to press on his/her selected floor and at the same time the person can press on the floor he/she want; Or the person could ask someone with the pass to press the floor and quote the reason that he/she forgot the pass. There are many ways to get to the higher levels without staff pass. Not forgetting there are security cameras, security guards and each floors may have inner security doors as well. That said, security risk for lift buttons outside the lift are of little concern.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On technical side of how the inner workings for the lift to operate. This require the lift to have a slight smarter operation system. It requires the lift to have a memory system of the order on the time each request for which floor is logged AND a efficient way of organising the lift door to admit passengers whilst going up/down. Having a log of the exact no. of requests per lift at which time enables the system to find the best way to allocate the lift to meet needs.</p>

              <p>Most people press the buttons when the lift is already in motion.</p>
              <p>It would be a cooler idea for people to register their floors while waiting and to board lifts that will stop only at floors close to each other. Saves acceleration/deceleration time.</p>
              <p>You can check this system out at AIA Tampines building. They have a sign with instructions but a lot of dumb fucks need the security guard to show them how to use it.</p>

              <p><em>The estimated time saved per trip is 100 seconds for 10 persons. </em></p>
              <p>On average, it means each person saves about 10 seconds. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="icon_neutral.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lift reached floor, Employee enters the lift and press the button. This action takes less than 3 seconds. Assuming it is a lift serving 20 floor, 12 people are at Ground level entering the lift, and each of the 12 people are heading to different floor. Calculating from employee entered the lift and pressing lift button, to door closed, and based on the linear calculation, we derived that it would take less than 20 second for 12 people to enter the lift and for the lift door to close.</p>
              <p>At no way it will save 10 sec per person.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Current lift design allows multiple pressing of lift button i.e. allows both e.g story 4 and 5 to be pressed together. In areas where lifts are serving higher capicity, there will be another panel serving the adjacent side of the lift (for handicaps). These two will work hand in hand.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I proposed an intelligent intergrated system with the following characterisitic</p>
              <p>1) lift door close when nobody at the door for 3 sec</p>
              <p>2) Multiple panels of lift button with multiple sensing i.e. press multiple butttons at the same time</p>
              <p>3) Intelligent software where it can lock the lift at the level once it reaches the floor.</p>
              <p>Current design allows the pneumatic lock to be activated only when the lift reach the floor. The new design will be more faster in locking i.e signal will initiate the locking of the life within 0.5 sec once it reach the floor .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I really like your idea, but your is ideal for buildings above 20 stories. To better optimised the system, the system should be better improve at the speed of the door closing and the time delay when tehe pnuematic lock is activated and the door opened. For buildings with higher floors, the speed of the lift will be the main concern.</p>

              <p>With the floor buttons outside the lift at every floor, one needs press the buttons once only. At present it requires two actions, first to call for the lift, the up and down buttons, when the car arrives, enter and press the floor required. With the buttons outside, the call and floor required is simultaneous.</p>

              There are such lifts around, there is a building inside NUS campus (but not part of NUS) that has it, the DSO Labs. It requires you to press before entering the lift.

              <p>Yeah people will curse your children grow backside on their face.</p>
              <p>That's why the newer lifts are programmed such a way if too many buttons are pressed, all calls are erased. When you got the chance, take a newer lift, those with many stops, and use all your fingers and thumbs to press as many calls as you can, see how the lift responds.</p>
              <p>I always use that feature to override a situation when idiots press the wrong floor.</p>

              <p>By implementing a sensor touch, eg if you press the wrong button, tab the button twice and the light will disappeared. True that if children press more than 5 to 6 buttons, all will disappeared.</p>
              <p>What if say a few already press the buttons and one adult came and unknowingly press his floor button and all disappeared cos it has reach the max? Everybody will curse at him too.</p>
