            <div class='col-md body'>here's a similar test, from the book kokology 2 (some may have read before):<br><br><strong>The Stolen Berries</strong><br>Everyone likes a nice person, and most of us try to be good in our own lives. Why is it, then, that there are so few people in the world who are good all the time? As hard as you may try, there are always those rotten days and moments of weakness where it just feels better to be bad. Whether that takes the form of driving too fast on the highway, cheating on a test, or Â“liberatingÂ” a box of pens from the office, weÂ’ve all done things we canÂ’t be proud of or justify. The key to becoming a truly good person is in that youÂ’re not perfect, not in trying to act like a saint while the devil on your shoulder whispers in your ear. We all succumb to temptation sometimes. But in the next scenario you might just get caughtÂ…<br><br>1. On a stroll through the countryside, you come across a field of delicious-looking strawberries. Your stomach starts to rumble, and thereÂ’s no one else around. Only a fence stands between you and a free lunch. How high is the fence?<br><br>2. You sneak into the garden and begin to help yourself to the fruit. How many berries do you eat?<br><br>3. Suddenly the farmer whose berries youÂ’re stealing appears out of nowhere and starts yelling at you. What do you say in your own defense?<br><br>4. After all is said and done, how did the berries taste? And looking back, how did you feel after your berry-stealing adventure was over?<br><br><strong>Key to the Stolen Berries</strong><br>StrawberriesÂ—seductively juicy and redÂ—are a common symbol of sexual attraction and desire. The way you envisioned this scenario helps us to understand your attitude toward forbidden romance and stolen love.<br><br>1. The height of the fence you imagined around the field is a measure of your own level of self-control and resistance to sexual temptation. The higher the fence, the greater your own defense. People who imagined a total enclosure exercise admirable restraint. Those of you who said it was only a string tied around some beanpoles at about knee height run a higher than average risk of getting burned by the flames of love.<br><br>2. The number of berries you said you would steal is the number of people you can believe yourself in love (or lust) with at any given time. If you said youÂ’d quite after eating just one, youÂ’re likely to be faithful in your own love life as well (or at least a devoted serial monogamist). Those of you who got into the double digits may need to think seriously about applying the brakes on your libido. Nobody can keep that pace up forever.<br><br>3. The excuse you made to the farmer represent the way youÂ’d defend yourself if you got caught having an affair. What was your excuse?<br><br>Â“IÂ’m so sorry. I promise IÂ’ll never do it again.Â” Sometimes a full confession and a promise to behave is the best way to get yourself off the hook.<br><br>Â“They looked so good, I just couldnÂ’t help myself.Â” Well, actually you did help yourselfÂ—to somebody elseÂ’s berries. But honesty is the best policy. After all, it worked for George Washington, didnÂ’t it? If you keep it up, maybe someday you could be president, too.<br><br>Â“Hey those berries were great! Do you mind if I have a couple more?Â” Farmers have shotguns. Spouses have lawyers. Fortunately you still have a chance to reconsider your choice of words.<br><br>4. The way you described the experience and the taste of the berries gives an indication of how you imagine yourself feeling when looking back on a past affair.<br><br>Â“Actually, they didnÂ’t taste as good as they looked. The whole thing wasnÂ’t really worth the effort.Â” All too true for most affairs. Chalk it up to experience and put it behind you.<br><br>Â“So sweet! So juicy and delicious! IÂ’ve never tasted anything like it!Â” Uh, letÂ’s just say youÂ’re addicted to love.<br><br>Â“The berries were nothing special, but all in all it was kind of fun.Â” Statistically speaking, youÂ’re in the high-risk group for repeat offenders.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To be most accurate, select the answer that you can best identify with, not<br>one which you think would be right.<br><br>1. You're walking down a path. What do you see all around you?<br><br>A. A deep, dark forest. The trees are so thick that only a bit of sky shows<br>through.<br>B. A cornfield. It stretches as far as you can see, under a bright-blue<br>sky.<br>C. Green rolling hills, dotted with trees. Beyond them you can almost see<br>mountains.<br><br>2. You spot an object by your feet. What is it?<br><br>A. A mirror<br>B. A ring<br>C. A bottle.<br><br>3. Do you pick it up?<br><br>A. Yes.<br>B. No.<br><br>4. Continuing along the path, you come across some water. What form is the<br>water in?<br><br>A. A cool, clear, serene lake.<br>B. A crashing waterfall.<br>C. A babbling brook.<br><br>5. You see a key in the water and reach down to pick it up. What does it<br>look like?<br><br>A. A simple house key.<br>B. A fancy antique key.<br>C. A small padlock key.<br><br>6. As you walk farther along the path, you come to a house. What kind of<br>house is it?<br><br>A. Hollywood-style mansion.<br>B. A cottage with a well-tended lawn.<br>C. A beautiful castle in ruins.<br><br>7. What do you do?<br><br>A. Look in the window.<br>B. Go inside.<br>C. Walk on.<br><br>8. Suddenly, something jumps out and scares at you. What is it?<br><br>A. A bear<br>B. A wizard.<br>C. A troll.<br><br>9. You run down the path until you reach a wall with a door in it. You peek<br>through the keyhole. What's on the other side?<br><br>A. The lush gardens of an awesome house.<br>B. A pond in the middle of the desert.<br>C. A sandy beach with crashing waves.<br><br>Question 1 shows your attitude toward life<br><br>A. If you chose the forest, you're deep, quiet.People find you incredibly interesting because you don't how show your true self right away. Pals love you because you're a good listener.<br><br>B. If you chose the cornfield, you're bright, honest and likable. You make friends easily and rarely get bummed. You've got a rep for being entertaining and fun, and you're always the center of attention.<br><br>C. If you chose the rolling hills, you're practical and down-to-earth, and you attract people with your straightforward nature. A great problem solver, you always listen to both points of view before taking a side.<br><br>Question 2 reveals what kind of boyfriend/girlfriend you're looking for<br><br>A. If you chose the mirror, you're searching for a guy/gal who shares your outlook on life. You've got a pretty good idea of what your ideal boyfriend/girlfriend is like, but you keep an open mind - the perfect guy may be someone you normally wouldn't look at twice!<br><br>B. If you chose the ring, you are a true romantic. When in a relationship, you work hard at keeping things mushy. You believe true love is forever, and although you might not admit it, you want your guy/gal care about you.<br><br>C. If you chose the bottle, you want someone who's not afraid to show his intelligence. Ambitious, hard-working guys/gals turn you on drop-dead gorgeous just isn't enough for you.<br><br>Question 3 tells how commitment-ready you are<br><br>A. If you said yes, you're dying to pick the right person.<br>B. If you said no, you're into playing the field for now.<br><br>Question 4 symbolizes your passion potential<br><br>A. If you chose the lake, you're not interested in having a superficial relationship. Once you meet someone you're really into, your love runs deep.<br><br>B. If you chose the waterfall, opposite sex think you're ultra sexy. You're good at turning on the charm, and loads of guys/gals lust after you.<br><br>C. If you chose the brook, you're always crushing on someone new. You're an expert flirt, and you're frequently on the move from one guy to the next.<br><br>Question 5 expresses your views on school<br><br>A. If you saw the house key, education is less important to you than the world beyond. Secretly, you may be dying to start a career and a home of your own.<br><br>B. If you saw the antique key, you consider education to be crucial. You want to work hard and want to absorb as much knowledge as you possibly can.<br><br>C. If you saw the padlock key, you may not be too into school, but you still have plenty of great ideas. You follow your intuition, so you may eventually end up in an offbeat career.<br><br>Question 6 gives clues about your ambitions<br><br>A. If you chose the mansion, you've got tons of goals. You strive to be the best at whatever you do, and you're attracted to jobs that let you express your energetic personality. Being successful makes you super psyched.<br><br>B. If you chose the cottage, you have a realistic attitude toward a future profession. Because your feet are planted firmly on the ground, you'll probably rock at whatever career you pick.<br><br>C. If you chose the castle, your career dreams could be a little unrealistic. Becoming a mega-star would be fab, but aim for something closer to home first. Otherwise, you may wind up being a little disappointed.<br><br>Question 7 shows your attitude towards success<br><br>A. If you looked through the window, you're a little afraid of failing. Taking that first step toward reaching a goal is the most intimidating to you, so don't give up before you've actually tried.<br><br>B. If you went inside, you feel confident about success. Nothing's going to stand in your way!<br><br>C. If you kept walking, success isn't a big deal for you. You're content with simple things and you'd rather be around people you love than spend your life trying to get to the top.<br><br>Question 8 reveals your worst fears<br><br>A. If you chose the bear, you worry about being able to stand on your own two feet. Independence is totally key.<br><br>B. If you chose the wizard, you're scared about things that are often beyond your control. So, to make up for it, you sometimes go on a heavy-duty power amperage.<br><br>C. If you chose the troll, you tend to obsess over how others see you. It's crucial that people like you - you're desperate to fit into the in crowd. You need to learn to trust your own judgment.<br><br>Question 9 represents your innermost self<br><br>A. If you chose the gardens, you're mature and honest. You believe in speaking your mind, and people rely on you to provide a sensible viewpoint. However, you may come across problems in the future that you'll have to solve with your heart, not your head.<br><br>B. If you chose the desert pond, you have a deep need for your own space. You're always analyzing your thoughts, and you've been known to do a disappearing act when things get tough. Sharing your feelings with someone you trust can help you feel better.<br><br>C. If you chose the beach, you are passionate about life and have strong opinions that you aren't afraid to reveal. But you're unpredictable, and you change those opinions often. Sometimes, like the ocean, you'll show your calmer side-but usually not for long!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

You're seen as vain, self-centered and one who is extremely domineering. Others may admire you, wishing they could be more like you, but don't always trust you, hesitating to become too deeply involved with you.<br><br>51 TO 60 POINTS:<br>Others see you as an exciting, highly volatile, rather impulsive personality, a natural leader, one who's quick to make decisions, though not always the right ones. They see you as bold and adventuresome, someone who will try anything once; someone who takes chances and enjoys an adventure. They enjoy being in your company because of the excitement you radiate.<br><br>41 TO 50 POINTS:<br>Others see you as fresh, lively, charming, amusing, practical and always interesting; someone who's constantly in the center of attention, but sufficiently well-balanced not to let it go to their head. They also see you as kind, considerate, and understanding; someone who'll always cheer them up and help them out.<br><br>31 TO 40 POINTS:<br>Others see you as sensible, cautious, careful and practical. They see you as clever, gifted, or talented, but modest. Not a person who makes friends too quickly or easily, but someone who's extremely loyal to friends you do make and who expect the same loyalty in return. Those who really get to know you realize it takes a lot to shake your trust in your friends, but equally that it takes you a long time to get over it if that trust is ever broken.<br><br>21 TO 30 POINTS:<br>Your friends see you as painstaking and fussy. They see you as very cautious, extremely careful, a slow and steady plodder. It would really surprise them if you ever did something impulsively or on the spur of the moment, expecting you to examine everything carefully from every angle and then usually decide against it. They think this reaction is caused partly by your careful nature.<br><br>UNDER 21 POINTS:<br>People think you are shy, nervous, and indecisive, someone who needs looking after, who always wants someone else to make the decisions and who doesn't want to get involved with anyone or anything! They see you as a worrier who always sees problems that don't exist. Some people think you're boring. Only those who know you well know that you aren't.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
