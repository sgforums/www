              <p>Hi All
                      
                      Just to share an unfortunate experience I had today which hope the public will take note of and don't fall into the situation I had get myself into.
                      
                      Today while using google, I was being prompt a advertisement stating I am the lucky person to win something. Thinking it was just a lucky draw I proceed with it. To make the long story short, because of the 1st lucky draw like impression I see and my believe in google advertisement, I fail my part in reading their long Terms and Conditions and fail again to notice something is wrong when I answered their endless question. In the end I had proceed on with something that is NOT a lucky draw but a contest that cause me a total of $150+.
                      
                      I hope others out there can beware from the mistake I had made and be careful of the advertisement offered to you. To me I was totally misleaded and I had to pay over a hundred for that lesson. The feeling is kind of like cheated.
                      
                      For those wanted to know or wanted to take note of the company that running this contest</p>

              First I am not talking about advertisement that prompt out while you visiting other sites. This time it is a pop up ad in google search itself. I had been using google a lot in  my work for searching of information and solution and it is my 1st time google seach pop up an advertisement. That is why I thought the draw was from Google.
              
              Anyway the reason I post it here is not to show that my IQ is low or that I am stupid but a reminder to other out there if they happen to saw pop up advertisement from Google proceed on thinking that it was a luck draw and the contest is from Djugo, please kindly note that it is not a lucky draw contest. I am not saying the company is a scam, just that it is not a lucky draw contest if you happen to think it is.

              Hi Jiani
              
              Sad to say when I first saw it I thought the draw was from Google.
              
              Therefore be careful and note the below:-
              
              1. Do note that Google do have pop up advertisement in their search page. However I do not know how it is triggered. The whole day yesterday, I only manage to trigger it twice. Once is the advertisement from Djugo and another is from Canon. Unfortunately the 1st advertisement I saw was from Djugo and being 1st time seeing it, I had mistaken that the draw was from Google (throughout the whole process I don't even notice it is from Djugo, I only manage to know the company name when I realize something is not right and do a search in google with the keyword "Singapore 78822").
              
              2. If you happen or manage to notice the name Djugo along the line please kindly note it is not a lucky draw you are getting into (there could have tell tale signs along the process but I really did not). The company could be offering something that is appealing to you, but if happen you are thinking that it as a lucky draw, then note it is not.
              
              I honesty hope I am the only one who had make this mistake so far and the only one will. Just want to alert other and hope they will take note of it as I believe this is something that can be avoided.

              <p>Don't trust anything in the internet, even when the logo shownÂ is that of a well known brand name. Ignore it, give it a miss, and you will remain status quo. Click on it and god knows what will happen. Not worth it.</p>
              <p>One time I took too long to compose a post here a pop up appeared asking me key in my password to continue. I just ignored the request, and copied the post. I got kicked out of the page, no prob, got back to the page and paste my post. Point is don't trust anything, even when it is a prompt from this website.</p>
