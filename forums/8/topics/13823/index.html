            <div class='col-md body'>Simple reasoning why the educated sg ger don want local sg guy 1stly is because their expectation are much higher with their high education level and of course also because environment which is the high standard of living in singapore. Do you expect a sg female executive to get marry with a sg male bus driver or ah_beng? Well this is the extreme case. But come on, would sg ger accept a guy who is somewhat less than her status?<br><br>2ndly, local sg guy are not up to that lucrative standard to appeal to these ger's higher taste. why? This we have to ask the male individual as well as the system in singapore. Let's heard something from the guy esp those single out there why they can't get any sg ger to settle down with them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I really think you are somewhat wrong. Would guys be afraid of gers who is better or smarter than them or earning more than them?? I don think so. I myself won't if there's such a ger who will like to settle down with me ON condition her character is good. Would any guy mind if his girl settle bill for him instead of depending fully on the guy to support the family??? Let's hear something from the guys please. At least, i am having a just married couple as an exception case where the girl is earning more than the guy and even sup a card for him to use. Which guy don envy?<br><br>[This message has been edited by Kyo23 (edited 02 March 2002).]</div>

Wat sort of egoistic attitude you tokking about when singapore is promoting equal status between man and woman?? Isn't this system the one that make sg guy less mcp and hence appealing to other asian countries' girls??<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think you are refering to those china ger from mainland. Would a foreign PR ger working in singapore need anyone to "yang3" them? Is there a difference then between these working class foreign girl and sg girl? Most of these foreign girl are degree holder coming to singapore to work. Some of them even come from very rich family. They just want to come out to a better working environment to work and be independent. Is there a diff between them and local sg girl??<br><br>Singapore government is promoting and getting lots of foreign talent into singapore to help build our economic. When these foreign girl settle down in singapore and start a family taking over the responsibility of the local sg girl since they wanna be their career woman. Is't this going to be inline with what sg government want getting foreign talent to stay?</div>
