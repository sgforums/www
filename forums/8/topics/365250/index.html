              <p>Currently on every sunday 11am Ch8 there is a tv show about Bruce Lee.</p>
              <p>Is the show a real story on Bruce Lee or is it faked?</p>
              <p>I wonder how is the real Bruce Lee like. Did the real Bruce Lee go around challenging foreigners and Japanese to fights and defeat them? Was the real Bruce Lee able to 1 person defeat many enemies? Did the real Bruce Lee every time he defeat a foreigner or Japanese than he will shout "We chinese are not Dong Ya Bing Fu"?</p>

              <p>Imo, i dont believe 1 person is able to defeat all his enemies at one go, no matter how skillful he is. No doubt, Bruce Lee was a legend. But if all his enemies were to charge at him at the same time, let's say 10, do you think he would be able to defend himself from them all?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But then, all his movies, are still just movies. Movies are made to impress, so sometimes, we shouldn't believe whatever is shown in movies. They are just acting.</p>

              <p>I read a biography on Bruce Lee many years ago.  The biography was approved by his wife.</p>
              <p>When he was young and growing up in Hong Kong, he did like to challenge the ang moh sailors to fights.  And some of these fights did get him into trouble with the law.  It was due to this that his father decided to send him overseas to study.</p>
              <p>He went to the States, and majored in Philosophy. And it was here that his own philosophy in his martial art began to take form.  And it is here that he boasted that he can take down any Chinese Kung Fu masters who opened up martial art schools in the USA, in less than a minute.  This, of course, did not go down well with the Kung Fu masters.  One challenged him to a fight.  And in front of other martial art practitioners and kung fu masters, he knocked out the master who challenged him in less than 30 seconds.</p>
