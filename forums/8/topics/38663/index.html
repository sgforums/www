Tylersword has written several excellent pieces on the ancient technology in Iraq and the works of William Henry. <a href="http://www.williamhenry.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.williamhenry.net</a> (notice link in top right corner - join Stargate Cabal) For those interested in this technology, see Henry's article on SADDAM HUSSEIN, THE STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN AND THE RETURN OF PLANET X. You have to wait for the Adobe Acrobat download, BUT IT'S WORTH IT!<br><br>RM News Readers who want to verify that the Shuttle Columbia "spotted" this light beam can go back to previous articles in RM News (included one I posted) on the streak of light it observed and news releases relating the phenomenon, as similar to "elves and sprites." These are very strange types of atmospheric electrical phenomenon. These were also seen and photographed around the Columbia on re-entry. I know Esclarmonde also posted an article on this.<br><br>HeraldAp<br><br>This information may be repeat for some here. Because of its'<br>significance I want to make sure all here are exposed to this. James<br>McCanney met a colleague of his from Russia in Laughlin Nevada and<br>confirmed that the Russians are aware of a large body/comet being<br>inbound.<br>Mark H<br><br>03-01-2003<br>Notes taken from McCanney's last radio talk.<br><br>He said he has interviewed a colleague in his field from Russia where<br>they have decided to begin opening this subject (coming large body<br>comet) up to the public, in fact he said that the United States<br>citizens are now the least informed in the world about this. This<br>interview (2/6/03) with the Russian scientist is available on<br>McCanneyÂ´s archives.<br><br>He doesnÂ´t give a specific date at this point when he predicts the<br>arrival of the large planet-sized object that is out there and is<br>currently having tremendous effects on the activity of the sun, and<br>on the amount of solar radiation which we are getting which is<br>affecting the weather as well as the amount of volcanic activity and<br>increasing numbers of earthquakes, but based on the behavior of all<br>objects in the solar system, there is no doubt that itÂ´s out there.<br><br>(Remember the woman doctor who had to be emergency evacuated from one<br>of the polar stations because she discovered she had breast cancer?<br>Well as an aside, McCanney mentioned that the earthÂ´s magnetic field<br>has gone to zero at the poles a number of times already, and because<br>of the tremendously increased radiation when this happens, anyone<br>exposed gets mega-dosed with x-rays and can develop cancer in as<br>little time as a WEEK!)<br><br>He said the last time we had a major close call that no one was told<br>about was when Hale-Bopp passed by. He said it was about half the<br>size of our Moon when it entered the solar system and (because of its<br>electromagnetic interaction with the Sun) grew to approximately the<br>same size as the Moon by the time it left. Its original orbit as it<br>came in would have brought it into an intersection with earthÂ´s<br>orbit, but as it passed by the Sun, it was diverted.<br><br>He said if we had passed through its tail, based on its size, we<br>would have been inundated by water and hydrocarbons (combustible)<br>thrown off from the nucleus, would have had tremendously powerful<br>storms, and tides three times their normal height, which would<br>essentially be like tsunamis which would have completely rolled over<br>the island of Manhattan (for example) and penetrated one to two miles<br>inland (this is without any "impact" of the comet itself).<br><br>The comet which is passing through now (NEAT), he says has a nucleus<br>about the size of Mercury (though the entire body, including the<br>outgasing tail has been estimated at up to 2X the size of Jupiter as<br>it passed by the sun). And even NASA has been quoted as saying that<br>the CMEÂ´s (coronal mass ejections) which this cometÂ´s passby evoked<br>from the sun were the largest ever measured.<br><br>Bill Pawelek was also on the show and said: there are four categories<br>of telescopes on the planet: 1) 4" to 8" scopes used by most<br>amateurs, 2) 12" to 4ft. scopes located mostly at universities, 3)<br>4ft to 12ft scopes which represent the older main line observatories,<br>and 4) state of the art observatory scopes with clusters of mirrors,<br>each 8 to 9 meters (39"/meter, you do the math).<br><br>McCanney said that most people donÂ´t realize that NASA reports to the<br>NSA (top secret National Security Agency), and that all NASA<br>employees are under strict loyalty and secrecy oaths. He said that<br>NASA, the NSA and the National Science Foundation (all governmental<br>agencies) are the major funders of the category 2 and 3 observatory<br>programs, which are dependent upon this funding to be able to afford<br>to continue in operation and make equipment upgrades.<br><br>He said that he has been personally following the tribulations of one<br>graduate student who hasnÂ´t been able to complete his degree because<br>the scopes at his university and every other university he has<br>contacted have been "down", either "for maintenance and upgrade" or<br>simply without any explanation at all, FOR THE LAST YEAR. He said<br>that all category 2 and 3 scopes have been unavailable to the public<br>since at least May of last year. He said that the category 4 scopes<br>have a 1 to 2-yr waiting list to schedule scope time.<br><br>He said that an even more top secret subsidiary of the NSA, the<br>National Reconnaissance Organization (NRO - so secret that congress<br>didnÂ´t even know it existed until its budget for an extravagant new<br>office building created a scandal a few years back) is now in charge<br>of putting spy scopes into near-earth orbit that are the size of<br>busses (some already there, others on the way), some taking pictures<br>and film, some monitoring communications.<br><br>And the most interesting thing about that is that some of these are<br>monitoring activity on earth and some are pointed the other way,<br>monitoring activity out in the solar system, including<br>communications, presumably of alien craft.<br><br>He said that all top secret programs like this have a public "mirror<br>agency" as a front, in this case the SETI program which goes<br>on "listening" for possible signs of life in the universe without<br>ever finding any, and thatÂ´s its purpose, to reassure the public that<br>nothing is going on.<br><br>He said that the Columbia had a project onboard which used high<br>resolution ground penetrating radar which has discovered a large<br>underground river 750 feet under the Sahara desert (as an example of<br>what it can do), and on this last mission this technology<br>monitored "something" that sent out a light signal from 40 to 50Â´<br>underground in Iraq and received a signal back. As posted in other<br>threads on this forum, Iraq is the original territory of the people<br>chronicled in the Sumerian tablets which tell the story of Nibiru and<br>its 3,600-year orbit, the same Planet X which is purportedly on its<br>way, and Iraq has a lot of ruins which Saddam has been excavating for<br>some time now. These people came from an advanced, space-faring<br>civilization -- their "artifacts" could be something quite<br>unexpected.

            <div class='col-md body'>from a site...but 2 sensitive to post the url here...so i quote some of those here....<br><br><blockquote><br><br>WHAT IS PLANET X?<br><br>Planet X is a planet that the ancient Sumerians referred to as "Nibiru." This ancient Sumerian word literally means "Planet Of The Crossing." The Sumerians gave it this name because every 3,630 years Planet X crosses Earth's orbit. The Sumerians counted it as the twelth planet in our solar system because they regarded both the Sun and Moon as planets. However, modern astronomers have dubbed it as Planet X, meaning that it is the tenth planet in our solar system, the "X" standing for "ten." Planet X has a highly elliptical orbit, rather than the usual circular orbit, more resembling the orbit of a comet than of a planet. It's orbit carries it far out into space, far beyond our known solar system, but then every 3,630 years it returns to the inner solar system and crosses the orbit of Earth.<br><br>Planet X is a humongous, giant planet over five times larger than Earth, and having over 100 times the mass of Earth. It has a magnetic core that is so powerful that it clashes with the electromagnetic fields of other planets in the solar system. It was because of this electromagnetic disturbance of other planets that astronomers in recent times figured out that there had to be another huge heavenly body in the outer reaches of the solar system. The search for this unknown heavenly body began over 400 years ago. There is a great amount of literature available on the subject for those who want to research it.<br><br>Astronomers finally discovered Planet X in 1982. It was in that year that NASA acknowledged the existence of it. A year later (1983) IRAS (Infrared Astronomical Satellite) actually spotted a large mysterious object in the depths of space. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory also acknowledged its existence. News items about its discovery were printed in the Washington Post and the New York Times. But shortly after these public announcements the great coverup began.<br><br>THE GREAT COVERUP<br><br>After the discovery of Planet X in 1982, astronomers began to study it seriously. They soon discovered that it was inbound, headed towards the inner solar system again. It was determined that it would cause massive earthquakes, volcanoes, tidal waves, the melting or shifting of the polar ice caps, sudden fluctuations in temperature and climatic conditions, and probably a shift in the polar axis of Earth. This information was passed on to the political leaders in our government, and presumably the political leaders of other nations. After some consultation, it was decided that if the news about Planet X and the worldwide disaster that it is expected to cause was released to the public, the public would react in fear, hysteria, panic, and anarchy. The result would be the total collapse of the world economy. Wicked men will protect their precious dollars at any cost, counting them of more value than the lives of their fellow human beings. So, a decision was made to suppress all information about Planet X, classifying it as "Super Top Secret." Yet, in the years since 1982-83, NASA and other agencies have continued to diligently study Planet X, accumulating a vast amount of information about it. In spite of the best efforts of astronomical and political leaders, working in collusion to suppress all information about Planet X, there have been leaks.<br><br>It is now known that the Hubble Space Telescope has been repeatedly used to observe Planet X, but all information obtained by it has been hidden from the public. Only a select few top scientists and government officials have been allowed to view the photographs of Planet X picked up by Hubble. It has also been revealed that the Hubble telescope is equipped with special technological equipment that prevents any interception of its signals by anyone other than NASA. Since it is only taking pictures of things in the heavens, why is it so important that only NASA receive those pictures? Do they have something to hide? They sure think they do!<br><br>It has also been revealed that since 1982-83 the government has quietly financed and built eight new observatories, equipping them with the most advanced technological equipment available, for the specific purpose of studying Planet X. These observatories are in various locations around the U.S., with two of them being in New Mexico. But the public was never told about these observatories being built with their tax dollars. Why?<br><br></blockquote><blockquote><br><br>YOUR CARING GOVERNMENT<br><br>During the twenty-two years since the discovery of Planet X, the governments of the wealthy industrial nations of the world have quietly built vast underground complexes (bunkers) capable of housing thousands of people. These bunkers are intended to guarantee the survival of certain wealthy political leaders, ultra-rich bankers, corporate heads, etc., and others deemed necessary for their survival and pleasure. These bunkers have been stocked with enough food, water, clothing, medicine, and technological equipment to guarantee the survival of the occupants for several years. Those "selected" to use the bunkers have also placed various treasures in them (art; money; automobiles; alcohol; etc.) in order to preserve these things for their future use. At the proper time these "special" people plan to enter their secret, reinforced, earthquake proof bunkers, where they expect to "ride out" the devastation caused by Planet X, emerging only after the chaos and danger is over.<br><br>But what about the masses of people on Earth who have no bunkers? Too bad! So sad! The ultra-rich political and financial leaders of the world could care less about the survival of the "common man." The only important thing to them is that they survive. They are the "nobles." They must survive in order to rebuild a "New World Order" and rule over whatever "peons" may survive the devastation caused by Planet X. Sic!<br><br></blockquote><blockquote><br>SOURCES<br><br>Is the information we are reporting about Planet X reliable? Is Earth really going to be devastated when Planet X (or some other heavenly body) comes flying past? Where am I getting my information? These are questions that every reader has a right to ask, and they deserve to be answered. Read on!<br><br>In our January newsletter I mentioned that some 70 websites (or more) are dispensing information about Planet X. Our readers can check these websites out for themselves. In the "Search" area of your computer, just type in the words "Planet X," then click "Go" and it will bring up several sites. Take your choice or investigate them all.<br><br>Warning.....Some of the sites carrying information about Planet X are promoting the New Age movement, Humanism, various cults, Occultism, etc. They are taking advantage of the coming of Planet X to promote their own deceptive agenda. There is also a website called "Zeta" that should be avoided. It appears to be a front for government propaganda, and is dispensing a lot of disinformation, trying to make the whole subject of Planet X look like a three ring circus. Beware!<br><br>On the other hand, there are websites that are reliable, responsible, and dedicated to informing the public about the coming of Planet X and the danger it poses for all mankind.<br><br></blockquote><blockquote><br><br>I have received much of my information about Planet X from reports issued by Dr. James McCanney. Dr. McCanney is an Astrophysicist that is known and respected in the scientific community throughout the world. He graduated from St. Mary's University in 1970 with a double degree in Physics and Mathematics. He obtained his Masters Degree from Tulane University in 1973 in Nuclear and Solid State Physics. In 1979 he joined the faculty of Cornell University as an instructor in Physics. For several years he served in a consulting capacity to NASA. He also provided copies of his scientific publications dealing with "the electrical nature of the cosmos" to fellow scientists connected with the Russian government. A number of his studies on planetary electromagnetism have been published in scientific journals around the world. He has written at least one book (probably more) that I am aware of on the subject of "The Electromagnetic Componet Of The Solar System." He has also written a 60 page manual for the public on how to prepare for the coming of Planet X. Dr. McCanney has known about the coming of Planet X for several years, but while he was obligated to NASA and other government funded institutions, he was sworn to absolute secrecy. Dr. McCanney no longer has any ties to NASA or other government agencies, and he is now "blowing the whistle" on the government coverup. As far as I know Dr. McCanney is not a Christian. He does not appear to write from a Christian perspective. Yet he is so concerned about the danger to the public, that he has a daily radio broadcast and a website dispensing information about Planet X. I don't know where a person could be found that is more knowledgeable, qualified, and reliable, to speak about Planet X than Dr. James McCanney. Those who choose to ignore his warnings will do so to their own hurt.<br><br>I also receive information from Mark Hazlewood, author of "Blindsided," a book about the coming of Planet X. Mr. Hazlewood keeps up with Planet X on a daily basis, and is in contact with other Planet X researchers. His information has proven to be highly reliable.<br><br>There are other websites that also carry reliable information on Planet X. The sources mentioned here should be sufficient to convince our readers that Planet X is not just a figment of my overactive imagination. Planet X is real! Its coming is being predicted by some of the top scientific minds living today. The effects of it will soon be knocking at your door. Are you ready?<br><br></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>continuation of the site....<br><br><blockquote><br>WHAT IS EXPECTED?<br><br>According to the Astronomers, Astrophysicists, Cosmologists, Geologists, Meteorologists, and various others scientists that are seriously studying the coming of Planet X.....<br><br>The Sun.....Planet X is already having a tremendous effect on the Sun. Astronomers and scientists began keeping a record of solar flares (explosions...Coronal Mass Ejections) on the Sun in the 1700's. Over a period of time it became obvious that solar flares reach a maximum every eleven years. Once the peak is reached, then solar flares decline for approximately five and a half years.<br><br>The the next five and a half years they increase until they peak again in the eleventh year. This eleven year cycle has been going on ever since men of science began keeping records of their observations. But something has changed.....<br><br>The last eleven year peak was reached in 2000. After 2000 scientists fully expected solar flares to decline, just as they always have done in the past. But they didn't! Instead, they have steadily increased in both frequency and intensity. The largest solar flares ever recorded have occurred since the eleven year peak in 2000<br><br></blockquote><blockquote><br>What is happening?<br><br>Dr. McCanney and other Planet X researchers are convinced that the increase in solar activity is due to the electromagnetic field of Planet X interacting with the electromagnetic field of the Sun. As Planet X comes closer, it is expected that solar flares on the Sun will continue to increase in frequency and intensity.<br><br></blockquote><blockquote><br>It is an established fact that the Moon has no light of its own, but is rather a reflector of the light of the Sun. But the Sun only gives off light according to the amount of heat being produced by its nuclear fusion electromagnetic generator. Therefore, when the light reflected by the Moon becomes as bright as the light of the Sun is today, and the light of the Sun increases sevenfold, consider the "heat" effect it will have on Earth and its inhabitants.<br></blockquote><blockquote><br>The Earth.....Planet X is also already effecting the Earth. The effects of it were recognized by planetary scientists as far back as 1995. Its magnetic field had probably began to effect Earth even earlier. Remember "El Nino" and the 500 year floods of 1993? Weather patterns have changed dramatically, producing "strange" weather. Climatic conditions are changing. The polar ice caps and mountain glaciers are melting. It has been revealed that in 1995 a worldwide "disinformation" campaign was launched by government "insiders," blaming the strange weather patterns on "Global Warming." But a number of highly respected scientists, who were not in on the "coverup," rejected totally the theory of "global warming." Rather, they [rightly] pointed out that the polar ice caps and mountain glaciers are melting from underneath, not from the surface. Why?<br><br>Due to the approach of Planet X, solar flares are increasing on the Sun. The Sun is ejecting massive amounts of electromagnetic energy into space. Some of this electromagnetic energy is being attracted and absorbed by Earth's magnetic core, causing the molten iron core of Earth to heat up. The increased heat from Earth's core is filtering through the mantle of Earth to the surface, causing the melting of the ice caps and glaciers from beneath. There is no "global warming" being caused by household sprays and fossil fuels, and never has been. Such a claim is disinformation put out by those involved in the coverup. A recent news release revealed that there is now somewhere between 20 and 200 feet of water under the polar ice caps. This amount of water under the ice caps serves as a lubricant, and in the event of a major earthquake and polar shift, could cause the ice caps to suddenly slide into the ocean. When that happens, it will cause massive tidal waves that will wash over whole continents.<br><br></blockquote><blockquote><br>The Coming.....Planet X is coming into our solar system from almost directly beneath the south pole of Earth. This position is considered a "blind spot" by astronomers. This explains why Planet X is not already visible in the night sky. But very shortly it will rise high enough in the sky, from our perspective on Earth, to become visible. It can already be seen by the huge telescopes in various observatories around the world. It is expected that by March 15th it will be visible to amateur astronomers using good telescopes or powerful binoculars. Then approximately 45 to 60 days in advance of its passing Earth, it will become visible in the night sky to anyone who wants to look. This will be approximately April 1st, and it could appear even sooner.<br></blockquote><blockquote><br>The Dates.....I want our readers to carefully note the dates being predicted by planetary scientists who are studying Planet X.<br><br>May 15-16 is the date of Israel's 55th birthday as a nation. On that date 55 years ago, May 15, 1948Israel became a nation again. , for on May 16th there will be a spectular eclipse of the full moon; "a blood moon." Coincidence? Hardly!<br><br>June 5-6, the date that Earth is expected to plow into the tail of Planet X, is the 36th anniversary of the Six Day War of 1967.<br><br></blockquote></div>
