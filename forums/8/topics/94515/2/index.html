However, becoz of this marketing and relatively lax regulations, we attract a lot of cons and this is definitely undesirable.<br>only way is that Singaporeans prove themselves to be better than these fakes who invade our economy.<br>I dun think that Singaporeans were sacrificed in any sense except that they must learn that ang mos r not at all better than us in anyway and that we would have to fight harder for our own positions and prove that our capabilities are better than them, yet at the same time maintaining a pose that we welcome the elite foreign talent, not those who don't make the cut.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br><br>Here because of economics and demand for their expertise?

Labelling them is as good as telling them we do not want them back and ostracising them and making them feel as if they are not part of the nation. This would no doubt make them more determined to not care about Singapore once they leave.

So my question is why are we employing those foreign talents then? Because they are better? We have singaporeans who are doing well overseas. Why not entice them?<br><br>I already made it out overseas (I was in the normal stream) because I was lucky my parents sacrificed their life savings for me to go out of the country and study which I did. My University awarded me a scholarship that paid for half my tuition fees because I was doing better than the  award scholars from Singapore in my course . I was in the top ranks.  When I came back...my salary was about a few hundred less than a scholar ( I know whom had a 2nd upper)  even tho my results were 1st class honors (which is above a 2nd upper). Why I asked?."BECAUSE THEY SHOW LEADERSHIP QUALITIES"....right from their academic performance from primary school til university . I made a mistake as a kid who didn't know better and that maimed my future in Singapore.Albert Einstein probably continue to be a poor patent clerk in Singapore if he was a singaporean<br><br>I had no choice but to pack up and leave if I wanted my future to be what I want it to be. Bright and shiny IN THE FUTURE ...not to be hindered by my PAST education results . Not easy to migrate out ...u have to tear urself off from a place u love , ur family and everything in the comfort zone. I have several career pathways  and a house I like in just 2 years. I still cannot say I made it because there is a long way to go but I can say if I stayed back - I won't have anything<br><br>The resentment is there and it still lingers. Do you know how much it hurts when a foreign university gives u a scholarship and asks u to stay on while u went back to serve a country who doesn't seem to care about u ? I do care about Singapore because it is my homeland and there is a sentiment there but does Singapore care about me? "Quitters" was a label that GCT called  singaporeans who migrated in his 2002 rally speech if I am not wrong.  It really make me realise something ...maybe singapore doesn't care about me at all .</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And I don't think I am the only one who feels that way overseas. I met Singaporeans in Australia and most  asked me how to get into australia. Why? Because sentiments are the same..no job ...taken up by foreigners . People can tell us to go and get out of Singapore but it won't fix the problem of why singaporeans want to leave not serve singapore. People have said migrating singaporeans are materialistic and do not bother about the country at all but face the facts...we look after foreign talents better than our own  . In fact they can say anything they want. If I didn't care about my country, I would not be even bothered about helping out  my fellow singaporeans overseas.<br></div>
