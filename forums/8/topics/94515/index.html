They are already secure in their political positions and earning alot more than other countries' government...who has the audacity to challenge them? Opposition also can't do much with getting votes because each time election , the electorate get "encouraged" to either vote for pap or risk not having the money crumbs thrown down to maintain their area.<br><br>We can whine about the policy and the government but I don't think they are gonna change it any sooner. So if you cannot change what is there , u r left with 3 options....u either stick it out and work in Singapore , fight against the establishment (which mostly doesn't  end well ) or become a foreign talent yourself in another country.<br>Option no. 3 gets u named as "quitter" in singapore and "foreign talent" overseas...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If I remember right, companies (just like football clubs) can only hire a certain number of foreign people and only for certain positions, and for legitimate reasons.  No country would want every top position to be taken over by foreign nationals.  The good thing is that there are many Singaporeans who are working as freign talent in other countries too.  What's holding a Singaporean back from being a foreign talent?  Being called a quitter?  I'm going to be working in Australia but I sure don't see myself as a quitter.<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am an analyst working at one of the world's top Equity Research Firm. Sad to say out of every ten analysts here, usually we have only 2 or three singaporeans. The rest are usually PRs from Malaysia and India. As these people are PRs, they are not considered Foreigners and there is no restriction on the numbers that the company can hire.<br><br>From what I have seen, these people are no different or better from my Singaporean mates out there who are still struggling to squeeze themselves into the top MNCs and who will do anything to take over their positions. Also, unlike normal perceptions, these white collar PRs are collecting the same wage as other Singaporeans and hence are not "cheaper labour" relative to the Singaporeans.<br><br>I agree with Parka that if these Foreigners are exceptional talents or are willing to fill up positions where there is a shortage of supply (eg nursing) we should welcome them with open arms, However, out of the PRs and Foreigners here holding white collar jobs, how many of them are doing jobs that Singaporeans can't do?? To look at it on a different angle if you keep on having the perception that Singaporean can't do the job so we need foreign talent, are we also depriving the local a chance to learn and pick up the skills?<br><br>In times of war, these foreign talent will be the ones who will take the first flight out of Singapore and if we need to rebuild the nation again, will they be here or are we going to depend on the "Singaporeans who lack the expertise?"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, i guess it would differ from industry to industry<br>to put it bluntly in some industries<br>esp. the more research based ones, there is no way Singapore can<br>survive without depending on foreign talent simply becoz<br>there r not enough Singaporeans with the capabilities to fill up<br>those positions. Even the best in Singapore is no where near the<br>best in the world simply becoz of the sheer limitations of our nation's<br>population no. People is the only thing we hav but we can only improve<br>the overall quality of every1 but trying to produce an Einstein is like<br>k wtf... So, that's where foreign TALENT come in. they r here to work and<br>contribute to us even though they may well bring their paychecks home to<br>wadever country the come from.<br><br>then u look at the other spectrum<br>u see a lot of foreign workers holding jobs that most Singaporeans usually<br>dun desire like the cleaners. They have a decent pay but most of us simply wont take up the job coz of "face"<br>yi4 jing1 mian4 zi3 zhi3 duo1 shao3??<br><br>now to the other jobs like working a factory or wadever.<br>Singaporeans usually knock off right on the dot (though sometimes earlier la hehe...) and r usually unwilling to work part time. I often hear complains that good workers are hard to come by and these companies have no choice but to employ the foreign nationals who r more willing to work overtime at a moment's notice or even volunteer to do so to ensure the production line runs like clockwork.<br><br>so here's my 2 cents' worth.<br>ya foreigners r everywhere simply becos we didn't make use of the opportunies given to us so we all kena screwed lor. foreign or not foreign ultimately as long as got contribute can liao la.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To have extraordinary talented non Singaporeans working in our country is definitely a plus point that we can built on and develope. These people are usually at the pinnacle of their careers and would add tremendous value to the growth of the companies by holding key positions in the companies.<br><br>I also strongly support the notion of hiring foreigners to take up positions in blue collar jobs that Singaporeans think too lowly of.<br><br>However, what really concerns me is the high percentage of non locals hired in the middle management positions in many of the companies here. Speaking from my experience in the Finance Industry, these would include positions such as analysts, accountants and auditors. These are jobs that Singaporeans are hungry for and would find no reasons to turn down. In addition, as mentioned in my earlier posting, there is no wage discrimination in these positions between the Singaporeans and Non Singaporeans in these position. Hence, this is not justifiable to argue on the grounds that non Singaporeans are cheaper here.<br><br>More importantly, these positions are importantly training ground for Singaporeans where they can be trained and groomed to their maximum potential. By allowing the foreigners to compete with Singaporeans in these positions, aren't we shooting ourselves in the foot by shutting out young Singaporeans the opportunities to gain valuable learning experience? Hence, this is not a case where we did not make use of the opportunites, but are we even given the opportunities to ponder over in the very first place? These Singaporeans whom we are shutting out are the ones we are going to rely on in times of national crisis and are those who would or have given all for this little island that they call their country and home.<br><br>To give an analogy in terms of soccer, we have seen spanish teams like real Madrid and Barcelona winning countless international championships with the help of foreign talents but when was the last time Spain as a national team win any major international trophy??<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it seems that when it comes to the Foreign Talent issue, most people are always hyping on positions where special talented skills are needed and the lower paid blue collar jobs.<br><br>No one seems to have an answer to why are we hiring non locals in the middle management/executive position where most displaced Singaporeans belong to? Are the non Singaporeans any better or more experienced than the locals when these positions are concerned? Are they cheaper? Are these postions being shun by Singaporeans? Are the local tertiary institutions not producing enough graduates to fill up these positions? This is a point which I cannot find an answer to.</div>
