            <div class='col-md body'>probably from the way you are brought up have a very positive attitude to what you will become. One army friend of mine is a gay, I guess from the way he is brought up in the family. He is the smallest child of the four with the three in front all gals.<br><br>From the young, he is dressed in dresses and playing with dolls. But you can't tell the difference until he starts to speaks or the way he moves. Urgh.....<br><br>Read from the statistics studies in 1998 that there are around 1004 guys to 1000 gals in Spore. What do except the remaining 4 guys to do if let's say all the rest of the ppl are nicely paired up ?</div>

So why do some people become bisexual varies a lot . But it is due to the sitatutions they face which caused them to adapt on Bisexuality.<br><br>( A few more and i' m through typing messages &gt;</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Someone have mentioned 2 possible causes : one by nature and one by nurture.<br><br>In the case of nature, it is found from evolutionary biology that humans are not truly heterosexuals. Their tendencies to homosexuality are classified in a range of spectrum, first from being strongly heterosexual to bisexual to strongly homosexual. In the past, the strongly heterosexual attitude is also encouraged as a social norm. Now, we are more tolerant towards homosexuals as compared to the past. Hence genes do play a part in determining our sexual tendencies.<br><br>In the case of nurture, I have friends from both sexes who decided to be gays and lesbians due to different situations. I asked them sometimes in the pub, why they chose to be like that since it is a norm that ang-mohs declare what they are whenever they feel like. One of the reasons offered by the lady homosexual is that she had undergone a traumatic relationship with a man who abused her, and she had a friend who was a lesbian, and in the end, she was converted to be a lesbian. She also said that her partner is more sensitive to her needs because she is a woman as well. My gay friends are slightly different. They are mostly good-looking guys whom the gals would hunger for. However, they decide to be gays because they had lost faith in the opposite sex.<br><br>I prefer to be a heterosexual, maybe because of the deep-rooted Asian culture running in my blood.</div>
