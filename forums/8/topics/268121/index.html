            <div class='col-md body'>I am in the streets of Phnom Penh today and going for my shopping trip in a minute.<br><br>Internet Access in the street cost 1500 Riel per hour, that's around USD0.50.<br><br>I realize that there are 2 economies in Cambodia, the USD one and the Riel one. Locals deal in Riel and have pocketful of Riel currency. Foreigners deal in USD, and locals, when they see foreigners also deal in USD. It's definitely not a cheap place unless, you live and eat like a local. Food at the roadside cost as low as 1000 Riel but when I had my pizza at the riverside, it cost USD4.50.<br><br>Beer is cheap! USD0.80 a mug!<br><br>I visited the Touel Sleng Genocide museum yesterday and witnessed a great example of the chinese's (from china) act of nationalism.<br><br>There was a log book for foreigners to write down their thoughts after seeing how more than a million cambodians were tortured and killed during the Pol Pot regiem between 1975 and 1979. Most people expressed sympathy, anger and sadness.<br><br>Know what the chinese wrote? One said "This is the same as what the japanese have done in china. Japanese must repent". There were a couple more entries in the same nature....<br><br>Shopping time! Bye bye!<br></div>

For the 1 whole week I am here, I only heard Singlish sounding people once. Maybe its the time of the year, no Singapore school holiday, so no Singaporean.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Shopping?<br><br>Got go "Su lian Shi chang"(They call it russia market) anot? You can buy branded clothes at like 5USD. Dont buy clothes at "Central Market". Those sold in Central Market are all imitations. In Russia market, some are imitation too, but some are real stuff, stolen from the garment factories there.<br><br>To tell the difference between real and fake, look at a few things. Material, real stuff use good material, if the hand feel is bad, most likely it's fake. Small accessories, like zips, real branded jeans use YKK zip, the small nailed button should says "levi's" too instead of a blank copper button. Look for tags, a decent branded garment should have the brand tag with size and factory code(a 6-12 digit Alphabet/number mixed code), material tag, washing &amp; care tag inside the garment.<br><br>If you go central market, can buy some jewellery there, those stones(ruby sapphire emerald) are real, but just the cutting quality is bad. If you look at earrings, you will see the cutting of left / right is different, which shows they have bad cutting skills. So buying pendants / rings are OK, try not to buy earrings. Dont buy stones alone, airport custom wont let you bring it out, must be on rings/pendants/earrings then can bring out.<br><br>Custom also dont let you bring out "Hong Mu"(red wood?) stuffs.<br><br>If you dont mind, can get some fake branded watch too. For around 30-50 USD, you get a imitation watch that is really mechanical, sapphire crystal surface(cant be scratched, the shopkeeper will show it by using a screw driver to scratch it), basically it works as good as a real one.</div>
