            <div class='col-md body'>Agree with Bangster many people will just enjoy the show....I saw it happen...There was a fight last yr at the Lido underpass at around 11pm.  Two groups of Malays were beating each other to a pulp,  And this ang moh guy with chinese galfriend decide to be a good guy &amp; try to stop the fight. Y'know  tell them to cool it, talk it over etc.  Maybe wanted to impress her.  maybe its in his culture to stop fights.  Anyway one grp of malays decided to beat him to a pulp instead. so there he was head bleeding &amp; defending himself in a confusing 3 way running battle with bottles &amp; dustbins flying &amp; galfriend screaming to hundreds, about 200 onlookers to "do something" , "don't stand there help!"   okay so some called the police but nobody pulled him out of the arena...maybe they don't want a bottle flying in their direction...but maybe the spectators, myself included, secretly just enjoyed watching this mayhem drama below us. And only the police could provide a fitting finale...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As i was growing up, I was always taught by my parents not to mind other people's business. I'm sure this has affected the way I grew up as I felt reluctant to help people who were not "friend nor family" to me.<br><br>Of course the sad thing is that there have been old people getting beat and nobody stretches a finger to help... most just call the police and hope that someone else who stand-in to help.<br><br>But as maya has put it, those people who didn't step in to help also probably dun expect any help when they are getting beat themselves.<br><br></div>
