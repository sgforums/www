              <p>For info, many Malaysian registered companies here in Singapore, then went to China and overseas, boasted to clients they were actually true Singaporean branded companies with Singaporean quality and values. Even they came here to learn our own branded Bah-Ku-Teh, Hainan Chicken Rice and Laksa (really Singapore styles and not Malaysian styles) and started restaurants inside China, then all their shops put Singapore names, told the Mainland Chinese their bosses were Singaporeans, actually Singapore Permanent Residents. Why I knew?? I asked China waiter to call his boss out and spoke to him. Later I found his Malaysian-slang Chinese language and he knew I was true Singaporean, he immediately kept quiet and said no more.</p>
              <p>Our Singapore brands were very famous and well-known in Mainland China but many Malaysians and also HongKies copied our products, lied to Chinese customers their products were truly Singapore brand. And their bosses were Singaporeans. (PR la!!)</p>
              <p>Our government does not know??? They knew but could not do anything that was why more and more Malaysian Chinese came here to be bosses and became S'poreans.</p>
              <p>So not only we need to compete with Foreign Talent for jobs, we also compete with Foreign Bosses for business, where is the Singaporean PRIDE??? You buy and eat the Chicken Rice and Laksa in China, actually cooked by Malaysians and HongKies, do you feel proud your national products marketing by foreigners in overseas???</p>

              <p>Not just Singaporean Foods, all sort of business: construction, engineering, material, and services such as design and management services with Singapore brands were actually marketed by Malaysians in Mainland China. And these people only our PRs!! Do you feel proud to work under Malaysians and earn your profit from your brands??</p>
              <p>But these Malaysians do not feel proud to be Singaporeans and always return to the home country for visits. They made profit from our branded products overseas and invested in land and property in Malaysia, not Singapore. That's why our economy is only growing very little from our own brands. If Singapore brands so famous in China, Singaporeans should be very wealthy here similar to the Middle East people in Dubai but many our citizens are quite poor and need to work for them, even compete with Foreign Talent in jobs. Do you really feel proud to be true Singaporeans here???</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Why Malaysians want to sell Singapore products?? Do you know Malaysia name in Chinese not good omen?? In Chinese language Ma-Lai-Xi-Ya means "when horse is coming, Sure Die La" so not good luck name. In Chinese language Singapore name Xin-Jia-Po means "the hills keep adding new things" so always adding in good luck.</p></div>

              <p>i rather say made in Japan rather than made in singapore</p>
              <p>i rather say my boss is from US rather than singapore</p>
              <p>if want to learn, learn from the masters.</p>
              <p>most of us are bilingual so what?</p>
              <p>Chinese who dunno can learn from the masters - europe country. Why learn from us?</p>
              <p>People who dunno how to speak chinese xan learn from the masters - china</p>
              <p>Why learn from us?</p>
              <p>Japan doesnt need bilingualistic to survive. China does not need bilingualistic to survive.</p>
              <p>We are trained to be bilingual so as to attract foreign investors here to be our boss. We singaporeans are forever slaves to others.</p>
