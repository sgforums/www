            <div class='col-md body'>I have a very urgent matter. 14th January 2007 is my ord day. i was an NSF in the SCDF and i drive the RED RHINO and met an accident on around december.<br><br>I claimed that the steering wheel was locked and not functioning and therefore i was unable to turn my vehicle and eventually hit the curb and mounted.<br><br>This result to dents on 2 rims, 2 tyres were torn, steering box break. ( from what i observed ). After the reviews from confort delgro ( SCDF vehilce repair supporting agency ) , the claim alot more... which resulted in a repair fee of almost and unbelivable $30k.<br><br>I was told to pay $500 to clear this case or i would be charged. I was not allowed to get back my IC unless i settles this problem.<br><br>May i know how can the SCDF be so unreasonable and do such ridiculous thing?<br><br>They wants you to drive the appliance just because they were shortage of drivers, as of good will, u help them and made their vehicle able to turn out. And when unforseen incidents occured, they wants you pay for the damages.<br><br>Furthermore the most hilarious thing is, they found out the steering box is broken, and i claimed i was unable to steer thats why my vehicle was unable to turn and result to an accident. Why could not relate that the malfunction steering box may have caused this whole tradegy? However they confirmed that this incident was due to human error.<br><br>I'm really unsatisfied with this whole outcome. May i know is there any ways i could appeal or seek for help to handle this problem ??<br><br>I really hope there are kind souls out there who can help me and give me some appreciating ideas. And i believed there are much more SCDF NSFs or Staffs out there who had enountered such unfair problems just like me, but probably in other areas.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Check the vehicle logbook, see any previous records of steering malfunction.<br>Before driving, suppose to do a pre-driving checks, did you notice anything?<br>If the damage is about S$30k, and they only ask you to pay S$500 to settle the case, i will settle it. Because i think driver / NS guys / officers is still responsible for the vehicle or equipment used, any damage, still have to pay.<br>My 2-cent only.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sad to hear the story. hmmm..... Delgro tend to charge more then the workshop outside. But since you bang a LF you also cant go outside workshop repair futhermore you have report the case.<br><br>Actually pay $500 still not that bad rather then pay the full amount, if not go DB sit 3 day , cut hair. Alot of MTL driver do went to DB before but most likely they can forget their CV licence.<br><br>Anyway if you want to appeal you can find or write to Dir. NSPD (Maj betty) since you are still are an NSF.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I thought this thread would get better replies if posted in military nuts.<br><br>Anyway, since you're still a NSF, write in and appeal. If it's not your fault that the accident took place, you may/may not need to compensate. It's always wise to check first.</div>
