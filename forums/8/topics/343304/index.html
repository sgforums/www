With so much happening, it’s easy to take the basics for granted the home you live in, the food on the table, the clothes in the closets, and the vacations that are enjoyed with family and friends.<br><br>However, life does not always turn out as you expect. The untimely death of a spouse could dramatically alter this picture, both now and in the future. For many families, two incomes are often necessary to maintain a comfortable standard of living. Even if only one spouse brings in cash income, the non-earning spouse may provide critical “non-cash” services, such as the many chores involved in maintaining a home. If your family’s income suddenly stopped or was reduced, the impact on your way of life could be devastating.<br><br>Having life insurance coverage on your spouse can play a valuable role in helping to protect your lifestyle. The proper coverage can help replace your spouse’s income or provide supplemental income so your home can continue to be cared for and your household can continue to function as normally as possible. If both you and your spouse work, consider how much your spouse’s lost income would ultimately cost. Or, if your spouse is a non-cash earner, ask yourself how much it would cost to replace all the services he or she provides at no charge.<br><br>Be Prepared. . .<br><br>The tragic and unexpected death of your spouse could easily unravel the comfortable lifestyle you shared together. Funds that may have been set aside for a child’s wedding—or your retirement—may need to be reallocated to cover basic expenses. However, all these situations may be addressed ahead of time with the appropriate insurance coverage.<br><br>While it may be natural to take things for granted, life can sometimes deal you an unexpected blow. Life insurance coverage on your spouse can help provide you with the comfort of knowing that, even if the untimely death of your spouse were to occur, you would be better able to maintain your present and future well being.<br><br>Copyright © 2006 Liberty Publishing, Inc.
