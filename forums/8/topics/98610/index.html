            <div class='col-md body'><strong>RINA </strong>- A girl I got to know recently. The reason why she's 1st on this list... Her writing style's very similar to this context... Which suddenly reminds me of the article(s?) I used to write during my poly days.. 'Runaway Train'...? Realised that she also resemble someone I used to know during that time... Very similar thoughts with me... But too bad we only managed to exchange e-mail for up to 3-4 times before we actually lost contact with each other...<br><br><strong>SERVER</strong> - Was down yesterday in the company. No web surfing. No yahoo. No sgforums. Suddenly felt like talking to someone.. Talking to people... And the world just shut down on you. I figured out perhaps that would be what it's like when I'm dead?<br><br><strong>SUPERMAN</strong> - A dead man. Heard that he did alot of works for the cancer charity...? Guess that's just how humans are? They probably would only be very much concerned when they themselves are the victims or are involved.. Sad? Nay... That's just the general way it goes... Stupidity? I don't care... Hmm... Probably because nobody would turn into stray cats and dogs to be dumped on the streets, that's why very much less people actually care about them...?<br><br><strong>SHAMPOO</strong> - Washed my head last night. Have not been a habit of mine to wash my head at night since quite some time ago. Last night gf noticed and asked. I just told her that my head itches. Sometimes just feel like having myself totally immersed in the shower... Let water run all over my body.. From head to toes... Now that I realise it's indeed such a good feeling... Like what they've always pictured in the movies... People sometimes do certain things.. Others ask why.. Then people would just give tiny excuses to brush them off... Then life goes on...?<br><br><strong>CHAOS</strong> - Been sharing my life lately.. Not something which I'm used to doing.. Not something which I could be really comfortable in doing... Makes me realise how complex my life really can be... My thoughts... The things which run behind it.... Would it end one day? Or would it just continue on...? Probably ends on the day I die... I'm a person who like simple but enjoys complexity... Weird combination? Ironically, since I'd really hated the day I was born.. I figured out that indeed I would be quite happy on the day I should die.... Everything should be so quiet and simple again... But till then....? There're still much which NEEDS to be done....<br><br><strong>CAPS</strong> - I'm not YELLING... I just wanna EMPHASIZE on certain things... I realised that there're lots of 'human standards'... 'Social standards'... The way to judge things... Good as general guidelines... But if you wanna dissect things and view them under such 'microscopes'...? That's when all the differences comes in... Difference in standard of judging... Way of seeing things... Hence so many misunderstandings... So much complications.....<br><br><strong>STATUS</strong> - Human's way of system... Somehow they thought it's the same as the nature's world of hierarchy... The 'selection' and 'survival' thing.... But then again it's not... In a human's world, all's too enforced and 'artificial'... Much more ruthless....? Nature has a milder way of handling things... Humans often tends to wanna take much of everything in their own hands.. The 'control' thing... That's why god never really stepped in to help them... Save them...? They're 'over-authorised'...<br><br><strong>MESSENGER</strong> - Recently, in one of my e-mails I thought... I'm either a devil or a 'messenger' of god...? Haha... Go ahead and laugh... Cause I feel like laughing too... Just that things usually ain't the way you humans see it to be... Thought of it to be... Hmm... Then again what actually makes me think that the world's truth would be reflected very much more based on a devil's perception...?<br><br><strong>ESP</strong> - Someone told me she has ESP lately... I don't know.. I think she's too DEEP into it... I mean.. If it was in the past, I would probably have told you the SAME... There was once this book which I've read... Tells me that at some points of our lives, many of us would actually believe that we have ESP.... Then I realised... At some points of our lives, many of us have actually thought of the SAME THINGS... Just that some of us tends to think of MORE similar things... That's why we clicked better? My 'ESP' didn't fail me... It's just that at some point of my life, I just focused on my thoughts and went for things which I felt are much more REALISTIC... I guess I probably looked weird back then...? Yeah... Come to think of it, I was... Probably still AM at sometimes...?? ~WAHAHAhaha...  &lt;<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">&gt; "</div>
