              <p>Nobody wants to excel? Trust me, even the most badass beng will have the slightest hope that he can score or even pass their exams. It's not that easy to study and perform well with an environment so deeply pressured through peer influences and constant shame from the public.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It might be easy to enter the institute, but performing well is hard, and just go around asking those in the working world, even Poly students are having trouble getting a stable job, lest an ITE student, only those with better grades are hired.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>People look down on them because people are very generic, they see a few lousy and low-performing ITE students and they judge everyone from the same school the same.</p>

              <p>I am from the old VITB, got no where to go, drag my feet going NS, then ended up at Pasir Panjang VITB... got NTC-3, never study for it as it was too easy, all score "A"s,  then go NS.  To me, no meaning at all just to delay going NS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After NS, not sure where I can go, no money no cert.  Ended with EDB apprenticeship scheme, course 2 yrs, bond 3 yrs.  Re-do NTC-3 then NTC-2 (Higher Nitec now).... did well at that level got onto another training scheme to do diploma at GSI (now part of NYP).  Bonded all my life...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As I look back, I never feel ashame of anything as I look back although I must say I felt inferior in those days and not really willing to mix with my friends.. feeling inferior and shy to tell people I can't study. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After NS, became more matured,  I hacked it, just do what is best for myself then as I don't want to depend on my aging parents, also I have no where else to go and no job.  That's why I took up EDB apprenticeship training scheme, which I  did well, and they selected me for Diploma study with another 3 yrs bond. after several yrs of working, my employer send me oversea's for study, got my BEng from Birmingham U, UK on full scholarship.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I always think I am not the study type, more hands on person even up till now in my current job.  Its only much later that I began to realise I lack confident thinking I can't study, that's why all these years, I refused to upgrade myself fear of failing and rejection...It was my upbring background that cause me to think that way..  Even my U course, my BOSS treat me to lunch everyday 1 month before I was suppose to sign the bond for the course, afriad I might resign as he had heard of others, which we were servicing proaching me. He was aware that I am not into study, so he physco  me till I gave up.  This scholarship was largely due to him and why I ended up studying.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, don't worry too much about what others say, just think what you can make the best for yourself.. I had met people 60+ studying and completed  poly diploma.. just to prove to his son...</p>
