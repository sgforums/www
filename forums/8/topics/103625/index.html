            <div class='col-md body'>When You Divorce Me, Carry Me Out in Your Arms<br><br>On my wedding day, I carried my wife in my arms. The bridal car stopped in<br>front of our one-room flat. My buddies insisted that I carry her out of the<br>car in my arms. So I carried her into our home. She was then plump and shy.<br>I was a strong and happy bridegroom.<br><br>This was the scene of ten years ago.<br><br>The following days were as simple as a cup of pure water: we had a kid,  I<br>went into business and tried to make more money. When the assets were<br>steadily increasing, the affections between us seemed to ebb. She was a<br>civil servant. Every morning we left home together and got home almost at<br>the same time. Our kid was studying in a boarding school.<br><br>Our marriage life seemed to be enviably happy. But the calm life was more<br>likely to be affected by unpredictable changes.<br><br>Dew came into my life.<br><br>It was a sunny day. I stood on a spacious balcony. Dew hugged me from<br>behind. My heart once again was immersed in her stream of love. This was<br>the apartment I bought for her.<br><br>Dew said,  You are the kind of man who best draws girls. Her words suddenly<br>reminded me of my wife. When we just married, my wife said,  Men like you,<br>once successful, will be very attractive to girls.  Thinking of this, I<br>became somewhat hesitant. I knew I had betrayed my wife. But I couldn' t<br>help doing so.<br><br>I moved Dew's hands aside and said,  You go to select some furniture,<br>O.K.? I 've got something to do in the company.  Obviously she was unhappy,<br>because I had promised her to go and see with her. At the moment, the idea<br>of divorce became clearer in my mind although it used to be something<br>impossible to me.<br><br>However, I found it rather difficult to tell my wife about it. No matter<br>how mildly I mentioned it to her, she would be deeply hurt. Honestly, she<br>was a good wife. Every evening she was busy preparing dinner. I was sitting<br>in front of the TV. The dinner was ready soon. Then we watched TV together.<br>Or, I was lounging before the computer, visualizing Dew's body. This was<br>the means of my entertainment.<br><br>One day I said to her in a slight joking way,  suppose we divorce, what<br>will you do?  She stared at me for a few seconds without a word.<br>Apparently she believed that  divorce  was something too far away from her.<br>I couldn' t imagine how she would react once she got to know I was serious.<br><br>When my wife went to my office, Dew had just stepped out. Almost all the<br>staff looked at my wife with a sympathetic eye and tried to hide something<br>while talking with her. She seemed to have got some hint. She gently smiled<br>at my subordinates. But I read some hurt in her eyes.<br><br>Once again, Dew said to me,  Divorce her, O.K.? Then we live together.  I<br>nodded. I knew I could not hesitate any more.<br><br>When my wife served the last dish, I held her hand.  I 've got something to<br>tell you,  I said.<br><br>She sat down and ate quietly. Again I observed the hurt in her eyes.<br>Suddenly I didn' t know how to open my mouth. But I had to let her know<br>what I was thinking.  I want to divorce.  I raised a serious topic calmly.<br><br>She didn t seem to be much annoyed by my words, instead she asked me<br>softly,  why?  I'm serious.  I avoided her question. This so-called answer<br>turned her angry. She threw away the chopsticks and shouted at me,  you are<br>not a man! .<br><br>At that night, we didn t talk to each other. She was weeping. I knew she<br>wanted to find out what had happened to our marriage. But I could hardly<br>give her a satisfactory answer, because my heart had gone to Dew.<br><br>With a deep sense of guilt, I drafted a divorce agreement which stated that<br>she could own our house, our car, and 30% stake of my company. She glanced<br>at it and then tore it into pieces. I felt a pain in my heart.  The woman<br>who had been living ten years with me would become a stranger one day. But<br>I could not take back what I had said.<br><br>Finally she cried loudly in front of me, which was what I had expected to<br>see. To me her cry was actually a kind of release. The idea of divorce<br>which had obsessed me for several weeks seemed to be firmer and clearer.<br><br>A late night, I came back home after entertaining my clients. I saw her<br>writing something at the table. I fell asleep fast. When I woke up, I found<br>she was still there. I turned over and was asleep again.<br><br>She brought up her divorce conditions: she didn t want anything from me,<br>but I was supposed to give her one month's time before divorce, and in the<br>month's time we must live as normal life as possible. Her reason was<br>simple: our son would finish his summer vacation a month later and she didn<br>t want him to see our marriage was broken.<br><br>She passed me the agreement she drafted, and then asked me,  Do you still<br>remember how I entered our bridal room on the wedding day?<br><br>This question suddenly brought back all those wonderful memories to me.<br>I nodded and said,  I remember .  You carried me in your arms , she<br>continued,  so, I have a requirement, that is, you carry me out in your<br>arms on the day when we divorce. From now to the end of this month, you<br>must carry me out from the bedroom to the door every morning.<br><br>I accepted with a smile. I knew she missed those sweet days and wished to<br>end her marriage with a romantic form.<br><br>I told Dew about my wife s divorce conditions. She laughed loudly and<br>thought it was absurd.  No matter what tricks she does, she has to face the<br>result of divorce,  she said scornfully. Her words more or less made me<br>feel uncomfortable.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My wife and I hadn't had any body contact since my divorce intention was<br>explicitly expressed. We even treated each other as a stranger. So when I<br>carried her out for the first day, we both appeared clumsy. Our son clapped<br>behind us,  daddy is holding mummy in his arms.  His words brought me a<br>sense of pain. From the bedroom to the sitting room, then to the door, I<br>walked over ten meters with her in my arms. She closed her eyes and said<br>softly,  Let us start from today, don t tell our son.  I nodded, feeling<br>somewhat upset. I put her down outside the door. She went to wait for bus,<br>I drove to office.<br><br>On the second day, both of us acted much more easily. She leaned on my<br>chest. We were so close that I could smell the fragrance of her blouse.  I<br>realized that I hadn' t looked at this intimate woman carefully for a long<br>time. I found she was not young any more. There were some fine wrinkles on<br>her face.<br><br>On the third day, she whispered to me,  The outside garden is being<br>demolished. Be careful when you pass there.<br><br>On the fourth day, when I lifted her up, I seemed to feel that we were<br>still an intimate couple and I was holding my sweetheart in my arms. The<br>visualization of Dew became more vague.<br><br>On the fifth and sixth day, she kept reminding me something, such as, where<br>she put the ironed shirts, I should be careful while cooking, etc.  I<br>nodded. The sense of intimacy was even stronger.<br><br>I didn t tell Dew about this.<br><br>I felt it was easier to carry her. Perhaps the everyday workout made me<br>stronger. I said to her,  It seems not difficult to carry you now.<br><br>She was picking her dresses. I was waiting to carry her out. She tried<br>quite a few but could not find a suitable one. Then she sighed,  All my<br>dresses have grown fatter.  I smiled. But I suddenly realized that it was<br>because she was thinner that I could carry her more easily, not because I<br>was stronger. I knew she had buried all the bitterness in her heart. Again,<br>I felt a sense of pain. Subconsciously I reached out a hand to touch her<br>head.<br><br>Our son came in at the moment.  Dad, it's time to carry mum out.  He said.<br>To him, seeing his father carrying his mother out had been an essential<br>part of his life. She gestured our son to come closer and hugged him<br>tightly. I turned my face because I was afraid I would change my mind at<br>the last minute. I held her in my arms, walking from the bedroom, through<br>the sitting room, to the hallway. Her hand surrounded my neck softly and<br>naturally. I held her body tightly, as if we came back to our wedding day.<br>But her much lighter weight made me sad.<br><br>On the last day, when I held her in my arms I could hardly move a step.<br>Our son had gone to school. She said,  Actually I hope you will hold me in<br>your arms until we are old.<br><br>I held her tightly and said,  Both you and I didn t notice that our life<br>was lack of such intimacy.<br><br>I jumped out of the car swiftly without locking the door. I was afraid any<br>delay would make me change my decision. I walked upstairs. Dew opened the<br>door. I said to her,  Sorry, Dew, I won't divorce. I'm serious.<br><br>She looked at me, astonished. The she touched my forehead.  You got no<br>fever.  She said. I moved her hand off my head.  Sorry, Dew,  I said,  I<br>can only say sorry to you, I won t divorce. My marriage life was boring<br>probably because she and I didn t value the details of life, not because we<br>didn t love each other any more. Now I understand that since I carried her<br>into the home, she gave birth to our child, I am supposed to hold her until<br>I am old. So I have to say sorry to you.<br><br>Dew seemed to suddenly wake up. She gave me a loud slap and then slammed<br>the door and burst into tears. I walked downstairs and drove to the office.<br><br>When I passed the floral shop on the way, I ordered a bouquet for my wife<br>which was her favourite. The salesgirl asked me to write the greeting words<br>on the card. I smiled and wrote,  I 'll carry you out every morning until<br>we are old.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is such a wonderful story : )<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by BabyLover:</div><div class="quote_body">My wife and I hadn't had any body contact since my divorce intention was<br>explicitly expressed. We even treated each other as a stranger. So when I<br>carried her out for the first day, we both appeared clumsy. Our son clapped<br>behind us,  daddy is holding mummy in his arms.  His words brought me a<br>sense of pain. From the bedroom to the sitting room, then to the door, I<br>walked over ten meters with her in my arms. She closed her eyes and said<br>softly,  Let us start from today, don t tell our son.  I nodded, feeling<br>somewhat upset. I put her down outside the door. She went to wait for bus,<br>I drove to office.<br><br>On the second day, both of us acted much more easily. She leaned on my<br>chest. We were so close that I could smell the fragrance of her blouse.  I<br>realized that I hadn' t looked at this intimate woman carefully for a long<br>time. I found she was not young any more. There were some fine wrinkles on<br>her face.<br><br>On the third day, she whispered to me,  The outside garden is being<br>demolished. Be careful when you pass there.<br><br>On the fourth day, when I lifted her up, I seemed to feel that we were<br>still an intimate couple and I was holding my sweetheart in my arms. The<br>visualization of Dew became more vague.<br><br>On the fifth and sixth day, she kept reminding me something, such as, where<br>she put the ironed shirts, I should be careful while cooking, etc.  I<br>nodded. The sense of intimacy was even stronger.<br><br>I didn t tell Dew about this.<br><br>I felt it was easier to carry her. Perhaps the everyday workout made me<br>stronger. I said to her,  It seems not difficult to carry you now.<br><br>She was picking her dresses. I was waiting to carry her out. She tried<br>quite a few but could not find a suitable one. Then she sighed,  All my<br>dresses have grown fatter.  I smiled. But I suddenly realized that it was<br>because she was thinner that I could carry her more easily, not because I<br>was stronger. I knew she had buried all the bitterness in her heart. Again,<br>I felt a sense of pain. Subconsciously I reached out a hand to touch her<br>head.<br><br>Our son came in at the moment.  Dad, it's time to carry mum out.  He said.<br>To him, seeing his father carrying his mother out had been an essential<br>part of his life. She gestured our son to come closer and hugged him<br>tightly. I turned my face because I was afraid I would change my mind at<br>the last minute. I held her in my arms, walking from the bedroom, through<br>the sitting room, to the hallway. Her hand surrounded my neck softly and<br>naturally. I held her body tightly, as if we came back to our wedding day.<br>But her much lighter weight made me sad.<br><br>On the last day, when I held her in my arms I could hardly move a step.<br>Our son had gone to school. She said,  Actually I hope you will hold me in<br>your arms until we are old.<br><br>I held her tightly and said,  Both you and I didn t notice that our life<br>was lack of such intimacy.<br><br>I jumped out of the car swiftly without locking the door. I was afraid any<br>delay would make me change my decision. I walked upstairs. Dew opened the<br>door. I said to her,  Sorry, Dew, I won't divorce. I'm serious.<br><br>She looked at me, astonished. The she touched my forehead.  You got no<br>fever.  She said. I moved her hand off my head.  Sorry, Dew,  I said,  I<br>can only say sorry to you, I won t divorce. My marriage life was boring<br>probably because she and I didn t value the details of life, not because we<br>didn t love each other any more. Now I understand that since I carried her<br>into the home, she gave birth to our child, I am supposed to hold her until<br>I am old. So I have to say sorry to you.<br><br>Dew seemed to suddenly wake up. She gave me a loud slap and then slammed<br>the door and burst into tears. I walked downstairs and drove to the office.<br><br>When I passed the floral shop on the way, I ordered a bouquet for my wife<br>which was her favourite. The salesgirl asked me to write the greeting words<br>on the card. I smiled and wrote,  I 'll carry you out every morning until<br>we are old.<br></div></blockquote></div>
