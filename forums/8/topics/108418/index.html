            <div class='col-md body'>A little story i grabbed from friendster..~<br><br>Joe was driving home one evening, on a two-lane<br>country road. Work, in this small midwestern<br>community, was almost as slow as his beat-up<br>Pontiac. But, he never quit looking. Ever since the<br>factory closed, he'd been unemployed, and with<br>winter raging on, the chill had finally hit home.<br>It was a lonely road. Not very many people had a<br>reason to be on it, unless they were leaving. Most<br>of his friends had already left. They had families to<br>feed and dreams to fulfill, but he stayed on. After<br>all, this was where he buried his mother and<br>father. He was born here and knew the country.<br><br>He could go down this road blind, and tell you<br>what was on either side, and with his headlights<br>not working, that came in handy. It was starting to<br>get dark and light snow flurries were coming<br>down. He'd better get a move on.<br><br>You know, he almost didn't see the old lady,<br>stranded on the side of the road. But, even in the<br>dim light of day, he could see she needed help.<br>So, he pulled up in front of her Mercedes and got<br>out. His Pontiac was still sputtering when he<br>approached her.<br><br>Even with the smile on his face, she was worried.<br>No one had stopped to help for the last hour or so.<br>Was he going to hurt her? He didn't look safe, he<br>looked poor and hungry. He could see that she<br>was frightened, standing out there in the cold. He<br>knew how she felt. It was that chill that only fear<br>can put in you. He said, "I'm here to help you<br>ma'am. Why don't you wait in the car where it's<br>warm? By the way, my name is Joe."<br><br>Well, all she had was a flat tire, but for an old lady,<br>that was bad enough. Joe crawled under the car<br>looking for a place to put the jack, skinning his<br>knuckles a time or two. Soon he was able to<br>change the tire. But, he had to get dirty and his<br>hands hurt. As he was tightening up the lug nuts,<br>she rolled down her window and began to talk to<br>him. She told him that she was from St. Louis and<br>was only just passing through. She couldn't thank<br>him enough for coming to her aid. Joe just smiled<br>as he closed her trunk.<br><br>She asked him how much she owed him. Any<br>amount would have been all right with her. She<br>had already imagined all the awful things that<br>could have happened had he not stopped. Joe<br>never thought twice about the money. This was not<br>a job to him. This was helping someone in need,<br>and God knows there were plenty who had given<br>him a hand in the past. He had lived his whole life<br>that way, and it never occurred to him to act any<br>other way. He told her that if she really wanted to<br>pay him back, the next time she saw someone<br>who needed help, she could give that person the<br>assistance that they needed, and Joe<br>added, "...and think of me."<br><br>He waited until she started her car and drove off. It<br>had been a cold and depressing day, but he felt<br>good as he headed for home, disappearing into<br>the twilight. A few miles down the road the lady<br>saw a small cafe. She went in to grab a bite to<br>eat, and take the chill off before she made the last<br>leg of her trip home. It was a dingy looking<br>restaurant.<br><br>Outside were two old gas pumps. The whole<br>scene was unfamiliar to her. The cash register<br>was like the telephone of an out of work actor - it<br>didn't ring much. Her waitress came over and<br>brought a clean towel to wipe her wet hair. She<br>had a sweet smile, one that even being on her<br>feet for the whole day couldn't erase. The lady<br>noticed that the waitress was nearly eight months<br>pregnant, but she never let the strain and aches<br>change her attitude. The old lady wondered how<br>someone who had so little could be so giving to a<br>stranger. Then she remembered Joe.<br><br>After the lady finished her meal, and the waitress<br>went to get her change from a hundred-dollar bill,<br>the lady slipped right out the door. She was gone<br>by the time the waitress came back. She<br>wondered where the lady could be, and then she<br>noticed something written on a napkin. There<br>were tears in her eyes, when she read what the<br>lady wrote. It said, "You don't owe me a thing, I've<br>been there too. Someone once helped me out,<br>the way I'm helping you. If you really want to pay<br>me back, here's what you do. Don't let the chain of<br>love end with you."<br><br>Well, there were tables to clear, sugar bowls to fill,<br>and people to serve, but the waitress made it<br>through another day. That night when she got<br>home from work and climbed into bed, she was<br>thinking about the money and what the lady had<br>written. How could she have known how much she<br>and her husband needed it? With the baby due<br>next month, it was going to be hard. She knew<br>how worried her husband was, and as he lay<br>sleeping next to her, she gave him a soft kiss and<br>whispered soft and low, "Everything is gonna be<br>all right - I love you, Joe."</div>
