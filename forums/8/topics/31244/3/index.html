            <div class='col-md body'>I know, I know...this post does not talk about WHICH pet to get, but if you're a doggie or cat lover...PLEASE read ad forward it to ALL your friends and ask them to forward <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>This was originally posted in reply to athread by Damsel about taking her doggie to the Pooch Cafe at Balestier.<br><br>Please feel free to ask anything you want to...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>BEWARE! There are LOTS of things which are BAD for dogs and cats. My friend who is a professionally qualified trainer (US, Honours) and is in the pet training, store/grooming/food business knows lots of dirty tricks of the trade, especially the pet food business. After all, his profession what...<br><br>He told me that a lot of things we humans think is good or OK is ACTUALLY BAD for dogs. Being an animal lover myself, I started doing research into this matter and found out a lot. As such, I now only feed my dog a certain brand of dog food. One of my cats recently got Lower Urinary Tract Disease (LUTD) due to improper dry food diet.<br><br>Recently rushed for operation - a few hours more and he DIE! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  If only I found out more about cat food before I met my friend! By the time I met him, too much damage done already.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> From the op till now, I have spent more than $300 in vet fees, and the treatment is not over yet!!!<br><br>Another point is, why do you think that when humans eat animal meat/products, they don't die or get sick (unless the animal carries a disease lah). And the consumption of human meat generally causes violent sickness and even death if a person's body is not accustomed to it? It's because of all the JUNK, chemicals and generally bad food we humans eat. Do U really want to feed what we eat to the dog or cat U say U LOVE????????????????????????????????????????????????????????<br><br>Also, eventhough your dog will most unlikely DIE from being 'pampered, it will lead to A LOT of LONG-TERM SUFFERING, DIESEASES and HIGH VET BILLS!<br><br>Also beware of what some vets say is ok to feed your dog or cat. There are a lot of greedy MATHER FARKING BESTARD vets who live a fat, rich lifestyle in their bungalows driving big cars because of all the sick animals in Singapore! They don't really care - and THEY KNOW HOW TO APPEAL TO THE OWNERS' FEARS &amp; EMOTIONS, and not what your animal really needs eventhough they are supposed to make life better for animals!!!<br><br>(I know I may get flamed for what I am about to say, but it's IMPORTANT to know...)<br><br>Remember, vets specialise in vetrinary (animal) medicine. They are NOT nutritionists or animal food experts, no matter what they claim!!! Of course, we expect them to know something, and they generally do. But have you noticed that most vets only carry 1 or 2 brands of food? And that's the only thing they will recommend because they earn commission/profit from it!<br><br>The question is: DO U REALLY LOVE YOUR PET/COMPANION? If you say U do, avoid feeding your dog or cat ANYTHING that the animal can't find in the WILD (no people, no human food sources, rubbish, left-overs etc around lah).<br><br>I dun mean to sound like I am preaching, but I stand up and take this chance knowing that many people will not like what I said or the way I say it, but what's more important...whether U like what I say, the way I said it or that YOU WANT WHAT'S BEST FOR YOUR DOGGIE OR KITTY?<br><br>At least go on the internet and search for topics like 'the best food for my dog/cat' or 'what not to feed my dog/cat' and other topics like 'natural pet diets'. It may take awhile but your dog may have a chance to lead a happy, healthy and relatively PAIN/DISEASE FREE life; and both of you will be happier. It costs less also in the long run - lesser vet bills, lesser fallen tears and suffering in your heart.<br><br>PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE (said in a begging tone, not screaming), spare a kind thought for your dog or cat and do research. Got internet very easy!<br><br>Here's to happy, healthy animals in life!</div>
