Her winning has scored a hat trick for India, as she is the third Indian contestant to be crowned at the international beauty pageants held this year.

Her interview with Bob Simon, who really lucked out to get this “60 Minutes” story rather than, say, a piece on nuclear waste disposal, was a marvel of feminine charm. Several times Simon, rarely tongue-tied, could barely get any words out when Aishwarya flashed her beguiling smile.<br><br>I loved the clips they showed from some of her Indian movies. These are erotic without being overtly sexual. Rai and a love interest lean toward each other, lips almost touching, then burst into song and dance. The big question for her fans is, as the CNN story linked above asks, “Will she ever kiss onscreen?” Rai was coy when Simon asked her about this. “We’ll just have to wait and see.”<br><br>I didn’t want to publish a post with the title, “Most beautiful woman in the world,” without doing sufficient background research. “60 Minutes” said that there are 17,000 web sites devoted to the glories of Aishwarya Rai. With my slow Internet connection I didn’t have time to study as many of them as I would have liked, but I can now release this message into cyberspace with full confidence that my title is eminently defensible.<br><br>If there are any doubters, I enter into evidence a classical pose.<br><br>And a modern look.</strong>[/b]</blockquote>and how many people might the above sources include? i doubt its 4 billion.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
