              <p>At times, our fellow citizens may have disappointed us, such as queue cutting, 'chopping' seats with tissue paper, overcrowded MRTs, whines and gripes, etc, but still, the Singapore spirit lives within us.</p>
              <p> <br>It is something that had developed the night we were kicked out of the Malaysian federation, and passed on from generation to generation - a spirit that is deep inside each and everyone of us singaporeans, and yet being a metaphysical spirit, we know not how to express it in words, but only in action, as an entire nation and not as a self centred individual.</p>
              <p><br>Even though we may be a democratic nation, this spirit is socialist at heart. It is love, honour, integrity and hardwork.</p>
              <p><br>Love<br>----<br>We singaporeans love our children. Our previous generation were poor and lived in attap huts, but yet they gave birth to us, provided for us, sacrifice much and help us become a middle class affluent society, when everybody else, espacially our neighbours,had given up on us all as a hopeless case.</p>
              <p><br>We love each other enough to contribute taxes, so as to fund social spending for all, helping the poor and all to get educated enough to be relevant for employment, a means out of poverty, as well as contributed sons to the military and civil forces to defend and protect everyone, even though we have no natural resources our own to give us wealth. We had only each other.</p>
              <p><br>We love ourselves, enough to be confident that we can provide for our brides and bridgrooms with a shared future of homes and children.</p>
              <p><br>Honour<br>------<br>Our men serve, protect and defend our nation with honour, willingly take up arms and bear hardships on behalf of our women and next generations. We faithfully keep to our national pledge and meant every word of it in our daily lives. We live by the law, follow the laws and keep to it as a civilised nation.</p>
              <p><br>Integrity<br>---------<br>We cheat no one and are generally corrupt free, from our political leaders to the roadsweeper. We earn our money honestly, no more and no less, and had even been grudgingly admired by other nations for people who cannot be bought.</p>
              <p><br>Hardwork</p>
              <p>-----------<br>We remain gainfully employed and seek no handouts from anyone else. We all work hard, in schools and at work, even till other nation feels we are too hardworking. We work hard to survive and to provide, not only for ourselves, but for those who are struggling behind in the race of life, to help uplift them and bring them up to our level. No singaporean loafs, even the housewives work hard to bring up our next generation.</p>
              <p><br>This is you, written on your behalf, from your own heart despite the cynical exterior you and many exhibit. A Singaporean. And this spirit that lives within you.</p>

              <p>Thanks for your kind compliment.</p>
              <p>Even though the dark clouds of recession are gathering, this indomitable Singapore spirit that lives inside each of us will lead us through, just as it did in our past - the race riots, massive retrenchment of the early 80s, financial crisis of the 90s, dot gone bust of the early 00s, etc, sustaining us and giving us confidence that what previous generations had gone through, we too, of their stock and heritage, will strive through as well.</p>
              <p>Some will get burned, some will lay down and mourn, but like the phoenix that rises from ashes, so too will this national secular spirit arise to further heights, pulling us along with it as long as we don't give up on ourselves and each other.</p>
              <p>Therefore, on this national day, it is a day of celebration for each and everyone of us singaporeans, man, woman, child of all religions, language, ethnicity and marital status.</p>
              <p>It transcends beyond all imported ideologies, for it is a living secular spirit evident in our actions as a nation. A day of rest and joy that our indomitable spirit had succeeded where other nations failed.</p>
              <p>Even though it seemed that the celebrations were for the benefit of our leaders, they are there only as honoured guests, as the official elected representatives of us all.</p>
              <p>This national day celebrations is really and truly for you, as many of our fellow citizens sacrifice that day of rest and joy for your sake, trained hard to put on a good show, that you may know for sure we are one the same of the same spirit, of what we had achieved with our hardwork.</p>
              <p>So put on your best clothes, be it a black  bow-tie with tuxedoes or comfortable bermudas and slippers, celebrate it at our Marina bay, or on the streets of Orchard Rd. You can do it at your home, celebrating it with  BBQ parties inviting neighbours. You can go out with your friends to our beaches and have fun. You can head north too without guilt, wherever you are as a citizen, for this is a day of celebration. A celebration of the Singapore spirit that lives inside you, an indomitable secular spirit to excel and never to give up even in trying times. This is your day.</p>
              <p>This is what our 2 leaders held in great regard, would seriously want you to do, from the heart - one who is groomed, taught, trained, and fully capabable - our Prime Minister Lee, and the other, NMP Sylvia Lim - the up and comming future hope for a credible opposition party.  </p>

              <p>Being human means having to suffer the trials of life - having no money, lost out in love, paying for mistake, etc.</p>
              <p>But it also means knowing the joys that a new day can bring - the splendour of a new sunrise, the fresh morning air, family, friends, and many other things that we take for granted.</p>
              <p>The choice is ours to make - to move on from bitterness and to be happy or to be sad. To learn to take responsibilities for our own action, to blame ourselves for the mistake we personally take and not blame others, more so our State, which is none others than us individually united as one.</p>
              <p>Today is our society's birthday, a miracle and a wonder to the world, a testimonial of the perseverance, resiliance of what a group of humans can achieve with just a patch of rock.</p>
              <p>HAPPY BIRTHDAY SINGAPORE!!!</p>
