            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Student volunteers raising funds for voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs) have been facing a backlash of the NKF saga for the past two weekends.<br>One was even shoved in the face by a member of the public, while others had their honesty questioned.<br><br>And upset VWOs are appealing to the public not to tar them with the same brush.<br><br>On most Saturday afternoons, you would find hundreds of students from various schools outside MRT stations and along busy streets selling flags.<br><br>In the past, the public has always given generously, but how has it changed following the NKF incident? Lets find out.<br><br>"Excuse me, would you like to donate to charity?" People shunned me, ignored me and even snapped at me.<br><br>Out of every 10 people approached, only one stopped to drop in a coin.<br><br>And those who did, had many questions.<br><br>"For what causes? I need to know what I am donating for."<br><br>"What percentage goes to the people?"<br><br>Some students were even on the receiving end of public anger over the National Kidney Foundation episode.<br><br>Christopher Clarence, Student Volunteer, said: "One of them even stuck out his hand to my friend's face and just walked on by, shunning him. People just told us that they do not believe in charities."<br><br>Lai Yi Ying, Student Volunteer, said: "Last time, before the NKF scandal, people are more eager to give the money. Now, they will brush you off, walk by like you do not exist, very discouraged and demoralised."<br><br>Goh Hui Leng, Community Involvement Programme Coordinator of Ang Mo Kio Secondary School, said: "My students went out for flag-raising last week and the responses from the public was really disappointing.<br><br>"We know that the public is angry but please do not take it out on our students. We believe in inculcating values and we believe in charities.<br><br>"We will continue to send our students out for fundraising. Please support them and do not vent your anger and frustrations on them."<br><br>The Special Olympic Group, which had its flag day last Saturday, said fundraising was an upsetting affair.<br><br>Koh Ai Hua, Administrator of Special Olympics Singapore, said: "Some of the students were told to go back to school. Don't do it. Why are you doing it? What for?<br><br>"For this flag day, the amount raised is about 30 percent less compared to the previous two years we had. This year we only raised $65,000."<br><br>Operating out of a void deck with a three-member staff, flag day contributions cover half of the Special Olympic Group's operating costs.<br><br>Programmes to be run later this year may now be cancelled due to limited funds.<br><br>The Singapore Action Group of Elders has similar concerns.<br><br>Phua Kok Tee, CEO of Singapore Action Group of Elders, said: "Over the past two weeks, the number of volunteers coming forward to help SAGE raise funds has significantly dropped. We feel that this is a result of the recent NKF saga.<br><br>"The amount of money we need to sustain our services will fall short, probably by 20 to 30 per cent.<br><br>"It is understandable, the public's mood and the environment. What I sincerely hope is that the spirit of charity and compassion will return sooner rather than later.<br><br>Regular volunteers like Joel Gwee said morale was low, leading some to even stop volunteering.<br><br>Joel said: "When we do fundraising, people stare at us as though we committed a crime. My friends who are volunteers are starting to lose faith in charity organisations.<br><br>"We are volunteers, we do not get paid a single cent. We feel like we are raising for the wrong cause sometimes because the organisations, VWOs, do not show transparency to us at the moment, so we do not know where the funds are channelled to.<br><br>"It is disheartening as well, for all you know, our hard work might be going into somebody else's pockets."<br><br>How long would it be before public confidence in charities can be restored?<br><br>Larger charities with surplus funds in their bank accounts may be able to continue operations for months, even years.<br><br>But smaller charities, with no surplus funds, may have to scale down projects or even dismiss their staff. - CNA/de<br><br></div>
