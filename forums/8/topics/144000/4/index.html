IMO, selling tickets is easier to sell than selling other products. I had no problems selling 30 tickets in one day. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Your testimonial is at stake here....thats why I did not wish to press the matter further when my teacher discourage me from helping out other charities for CIP.<br><br>The moment you try to something different, everyone thinks you are trying to be hero. And I have the impression that schools want to help out NKF is becos  they like awards. NKF dishes out awards to schools who help collect donations for them. Awards come in Bronze,Silver and Gold. ANd there is also a"top fund raiser award" for the school that collects the most donations!<br>This explains why you face so much resistance from your school........</div>
