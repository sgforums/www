              <p>Mr Paul Midler was in a restaurant in China where he saw some cats being kept in a cage.<br><br>He said: "I saw what looked like a pair of tongs and a wooden stick on a cage full of cats."<br><br>"Then I saw a man come out of the kitchen and I thought he was going to explain to me why the cats were in the cage."<br><br>"Instead, he opened the cage, took the tongs and used them to lift one of the cats up by its neck. The cat was crying, and then the man suddenly cracked it on the head with the stick."<br><br>"I tried to look away so as not to be a witness, but it was too late. It's hard to get an image like that out of your memory."<br><br>Mr Midler believes the cat was being served up as a meal.<br><br>In the five years that he worked as a "manufacturing go-between", helping US, Uropean and Chinese companies do business in China, Mr Midler, 41, came across more shocking tales, some of which he put into his book, Poorly Made In China.<br><br>Calling Chinese manufacturing "very challenging work", Mr Midler said "When in China, you need to think about every eventuality and imagine how things might possibly go wrong. Many things are different in China than in other places.<br><br>One behavior trait that worried him - that Chinese manufacturers would often manipulate a product so that it would pass a third-party laboratory test.<br><br>"This has a real-life example in the melamine case, where Chinese dairy product manufacturers added a toxic product so that it could pass as a protein in the laboratory tests.<br><br>"The manipulation was toxic to the point that hundreds of thousands of Chinese children got sick.<br><br>Two people were executed for the offence, but we have to wonder whether lessons were learned given additional quality failures of a similar nature."<br><br>Mr Midler's favourite story was about his stay in a five-star hotel in China and finding out the toilet flush was not working.<br><br>He said "At first, the staff tried to convince me that there was no problem, and then they admitted there might be a problem but asked me whether I wouldn't mind living with it."<br><br>"When I suggested that we try to solve the problem in earnest, I was then accused of having created the problem in the first place. When this tactic did not work, I was next given a litany of excuses.<br><br>I used this one example to show how difficult solving even basic problems in China can be."</p>
