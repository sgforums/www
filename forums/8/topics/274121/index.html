Everyone is invited, especially those who love kids, to help in the painting of the school's exterior and staircase with Disney characters. Paints and brushes will be provided, and the outline of the pictures to be painted already drawn out. All you have to do is guide the kids at the preschool fill the colours in.<br><br>It's a one- day activity held on a weekend around the first week of September. Venue is at a preschool located near Kovan Mrt Station. Don't worry, full details will be provided once preparations are almost done. Right now, we are looking for volunteers to fill in the slots.<br><br>If any of your family or friends are willing to spend one or two hours on a weekend helping out, or anyone who may like to join in as a group, do give Marissa a call at 92235011. Looking forward to your support... your help will be very much appreciated. </div></blockquote>I think you better forget the ideal of painting Disney character !!!

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Storywolf and Vince69, thanks... will definitely take note of that, and if you have anything else to add, feel free to go ahead. Well, maybe we can change the pics to something else... In the meanwhile, probably you guys may like to put your guard down... We're still in the discussion with the preschool right now, the actual plans have yet been approved by the school staff and I'm sure they will take utmost care and concern in ensuring that the children be kept safe and concerns about security that parents may have in mind.<br><br>Please note that it is a respectable preschool which we are talking about here... and I request for the public not to make any assumptions regarding any safety and security concerns. First of all, there will be staff to look after the children, and ensure that the children be kept under close watch all the time. And as far as I know, it has always maintained its image in adhering strictly to the rules laid down by the Childcare Association.<br><br>It is just that at the present moment, we are looking for people(not more than 10) to help us carry this out... the actual plan hasn't been borne yet. Just think of this as a community project, like a day out to a field- trip. Isn't everyone, including you and me, who want to join in the fun be allowed to mingle around. It's just a day of pure fun on a weekend morning or afternoon, with the intention of letting everyone, especially the kids be involved.<br><br>Nevertheless, I like the idea of having the parents get involved in this activity instead. In this way, it can mean more bonding time with the kids... and parents can make sure their kids are kept in safe wach too... that is, right under their noses.<br><br>If you have any more ideas on this activity can be made even better, feel free to write your ideas here.</div>
