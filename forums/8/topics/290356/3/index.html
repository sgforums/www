Even regulars in SAF got the golden handshake (transition which they term it)<br><br>the thing is whether our locals wan to mix with them boh. They cluster fark prolly is that it is easy for them to chit chat around.<br>an example is most of you are chinese speaking and a few is japanese speaking, the japanese will cluster cos of the common language and somehow similar backgrounds. Ask yourself if you are pro-active enough to make the first move.</div>
