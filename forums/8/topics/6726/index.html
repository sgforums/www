            <div class='col-md body'>What punishment(s) do u think should be given to the maid who threw the 14-mth-old baby girl out of the flat in Hougang?<br><br>My answer? Hang the maid. How could someone be so inhumane as to throw a baby girl out of the window. It seems that more and more incidents show that these people (indonesians, filipinos, etc) who work as maids or construction workers cannot be trusted and they will not be grateful to the employers who treat them very well. UNGRATEFUL BASTARDS.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah, as they say, why do you want to let a stranger into your house and be alone with your children?<br><br>but do remember that some employers are made in hell, they pour hot water and beat their maids up with hangers.  I think there's some problem going on here with the maid-employer relationship.  *me wears her detective clothes and starts to investigate*</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>just a thought. most of these foreign workers usually borrow a HUGE sum [in their country at least, let's say S$3000, i think it's equivalent to 13++ million Rupiahs in Indonesia &amp; their daily average pay is about US$2 if they're lucky] of money to give to the middleman just so that they can come to sunny S'pore to work as maids for a measly S$270-S$300/mth with NO Sundays off. they usually worked their first year to pay off the loan. now, this young girl has barely worked for the toddlerÂ’s parents for 2 months when they decided to send her back to Indonesia, can you imagine her distress? thereÂ’s no way she could pay back her loan &amp; her people may not even forgive her or treat her with kindness when she gets back to her hometown. if she did indeed throw the toddler down, what she did was wrong &amp; regrettable but try to imagine her state of despair.<br><br>i understand from a friend that if one is not happy with a maid, they could send her back to the agency &amp; request for a change of maid, in this instance, the maid in question still has a chance to continue to work in SÂ’pore, whereas if you sent her back, she doesnÂ’t has that chance anymore. if iÂ’m wrong on this point, i hope someone could correct me.<br><br>we often hear tales of horrific torture of these maids, sometimes i think SÂ’porean are too affluent that they forgot once our forefathers were poor immigrants too. i just wish that most will realize that maids are humans too &amp; treat them with dignity even if their occupation is that of a lowly paid servant.<br><br>we are not privy to what happened in that household but before everyone condemn the maid, just also spare a thought for her plight. this doesnÂ’t mean that i condone her action or that i donÂ’t empathize with the parents of the toddler, itÂ’s truly an unfortunate tragedy for them.<br><br>[This message has been edited by colette (edited 24 March 2000).]</div>

Castrate the employer?

            <div class='col-md body'>Sad Story.She did wat she did and should be responsible for her actions...Anyway...did the news report say that the empolyer is going to send the maid home themselves?...I haven't seen the news from the papers yet but I don't think so cos the government procedures for bringing in a maid is quite tedious for a layman and I think most people would rather leave it to a maid agency to recruit one...and since the maid comes from the agency...she should be returned to the agency....<br><br>Of course...this is just a guess....<br><br>I also feel that some Singaporeans are getting more and more impatient with their maids and not treating them fairly.Maids also human and it's the place where they come from that makes them different in "social status" from us...<br><br>------------------<br>"Have you ever noticed?
