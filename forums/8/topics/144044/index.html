            <div class='col-md body'>Circus Humans?<br><br>I once heard the story of a grown bear that lived in a cage and<br>travelled with a circus ever since he was a small cub. The bear spent<br>everyday of his life pacing back and forth in his cage while countless<br><br>spectators looked on. When the bear-keepers were not looking, some of<br>the spectators would poke the bear with sharp sticks. Sometimes they<br>would throw pieces of food filled with broken glass into the cage.<br>When the great bear ate what he thought was a wonderful treat, the<br>broken glass would cut the inside of his throat and stomach.<br><br>One day a wealthy animal-lover visited the circus and saw the harmful<br>acts committed against the bear. Because he felt great compassion for<br>animals he approached the circus about purchasing the bear. He<br>explained that he would take the bear and place him in a large open<br>area. In this area the bear would have cool pools of water to play in<br>and verdant fields to run. The circus agreed to sell the bear to the<br>man and set up a delivery date.<br><br>When the day arrived for the bear to be delivered, everyone was<br>anxious to see what would happen when the door of the cage was opened<br>for the first time. To everyone's amazement, when the cage was opened,<br><br>the bear did what he spent every day of his life doing. He simply<br>paced back and forth the length of the cage. The bear didn't even seem<br>to care that the cage door was open. Finally, the bear-keepers got the<br>bear outside the cage and rolled it away.<br><br>The bear looked around at his beautiful new home. He looked at the<br>cool pools of water and the lush green pastures. Then to everyone's<br>surprise and disappointment, the bear began his pacing. Back and forth<br><br>he would go, as in an imaginary cage. Eventually he had to be put to<br>sleep because he simply could not function in his beautiful new<br>surroundings.<br><br>This is the powerful way we become slaves to our past, to our habits.<br>This is how many of us, not just circus animals, learn to accept that there is nothing better for us. Even when it's staring us in the face.<br><br>To a large degree, our history and past experience determine the<br>person we are today. Yes, we are the result of upbringing, of<br>education, of constraining social norms. But that's no excuse for<br>accepting a routine, meaningless lifestyle. That's no excuse for not<br>being the person you want to be.<br><br>Many of us have responsibilities towards others - our families and<br>loved ones. Some of us put up with less than desirable conditions<br>because of those obligations. But how many of those obligations are<br>really excuses for not making things better?<br><br>In a world of possibilities, are you pacing the length of your<br>imaginary cage?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
