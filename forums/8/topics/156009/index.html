I don't know if you heard this joke that illustrates how<br>smart our leaders are:<br><br>Once LKY in 1996 went to Malaysia to visit Dr. Mahathir. Mahathir is<br>the person who almost single handedly created the Malaysian car<br>industry. So when LKY came to visit, Dr. M eagerly showed LKY his<br>Proton Saga factory - "Here we invested $300M, paid Mitsubitshi $100M<br>for technology transfers, and invested $50M for branding. Now we are<br>ready to make money, we can sell each Proton Saga car for $30,000". LKY laughed<br>and said, "Oh...too much trouble, we print this certificate called the COE that<br>costs 5 cents a piece, and sell them to our citizens for $40,000".<br><br>Make your conclusion which govt is smarter! Of course it does not end<br>there, the PAP govt has devised the most ingenious money making machine from car<br>ownership. And to get Singaporeans to take the bait, the MAS has allowed zero<br>down payment car loans.<br><br>Car Price = Registration fee + Cost Price + Road Tax + COE + additional<br>registration fee (140% of OMV) and customs duty (31% of OMV).<br><br>Of course once you buy the car you pay petrol tax which is 35%+GST 5%. In<br>Malaysia, there is no petrol tax instead the govt gives a petrol subsidy to make<br>it more affordable for people to drive. Ah<br>the Malaysia govt is so stupid to miss such money making pportunities!!!!<br><br>Anyway, the Singapore govt puts all the surplus funds collected to good use. For<br>example, giving out scholarship to foreigners, investing overseas, and investing<br>in R&amp;D....see when these foreign<br>scholars finish school, they will need R&amp;D jobs we have to ensure they are fully<br>employed.<br><br>See how smart our govt is?

Congestion on the CTE will build up again and<br>traffic will slow.<br><br>The LTA will then be able to say that they must increase the ERP levy<br>on the CTE in their next review.<br><br>The 50 cents-to-$1 charge will no longer be a deterrent as the<br>tolerance level will have gone up.<br><br>Thus, the toll will become a revenue-generating exercise rather than<br>a solution to the traffic congestion on the CTE.<br><br>Lim Boon Hee<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Comments By Mellanie Hewlitt;<br>"The scam is also revealed when a car owner attempts to scrap<br>prematurely. The system does not allow the car owner a cash rebate on<br>the balance COE. Instead, the car owner has to purchase another car<br>(and another COE) and deduct his COE rebates from the final purchase<br>price. This ruse ensures that COE money remains with the government<br>even when a COE is scrapped prematurely, thus assuring them of a<br>steady income stream, albeit at the expense of car owners."<br><br>By:Teng Haw Kiad<br>TODAY<br>8 June 2005<br><br>WHY NOT GIVE COE REBATE IN CASH, NOT CREDIT?<br>--------------------------------------------<br>I BOUGHT a car that cost me approximately the remaining value of its COE.<br>When the car was beyond economical repair, I scrapped it and got the<br>remaining, pro-rated portion of the COE in return.<br><br>However, this was returned as credit that I could only use to register<br>another car or to purchase a new COE.<br><br>First, can the Land Transport Authority (LTA) explain the rationale for<br>keeping my credit - instead of giving it back in the form of cash - if I<br>have already returned the COE, which can be put back into the COE pool to<br>generate new revenue?<br><br>This system only benefits car-dealers, as they will only take in my COE<br>rebate at a far lower price than the paper value.<br><br>They can then use this rebate to pay for the COE of any new vehicle they<br>sell.<br><br>One car dealer even had the audacity to offer me $1,500 for my $2,500 COE<br>rebate. They can do so because they know I am at their mercy, due to the<br>six-month expiry date on the rebate.<br><br>Second, can LTA give a longer validity period for the rebate, so that<br>those who have just scrapped their cars will not be susceptible to<br>blackmail by the car-dealers? Of course, it would be even better if the<br>LTA could give the rebate in cash, even if it is in instalments.<br><br>Third, can LTA suggest alternatives for someone who cannot afford a new<br>car, and who is thus stuck with a COE rebate he refuses to be pressured<br>into trading in for almost half its value?<br><br>Letter from<br><br>Teng Haw Kiad<br><br>======================================================================<br><br>By: Mellanie Hewlitt<br>Singapore Review<br>15 Jan 2005<br><br>COE, Parf, ARF - confused? Characteristics of The Great COE Scam<br><br>It is glaring that although Singapore has the world's most expensive<br>cars, the vast majority of car owners remain confounded by the<br>complicated pricing and ownership system. (See artcile from the New<br>Paper 14 Jan 2005 "COE, Parf, ARF - confused?")<br>http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/top/story/0,4136,81225,00.html?<br><br>In all developed countries, buying a car is a simple and transparent<br>affair that is concluded between buyer and seller. The only other<br>third-parties involved are the insurance company and the finance<br>company. In Singapore a series of bureaucratic shields and paperwork<br>complicate the process.<br><br>The system is massively complicated, designed to confuse the average<br>car buyer. The objective is to disguise the underlying scam which<br>involves siphoning funds from the car owner into the bloated coffers<br>of the government.<br><br>The latest tender saw car COE premiums ending at $18,400 (up to<br>1,600cc) and $14,002 (above 1,600cc) - the lowest in over a decade.<br>The government is set to release between 100,000 to 120,000 COEs this<br>year. At an average COE "price" of approx SGD16,201 per COE this<br>amounts to a whopping SGD1,944,120,000/- in COE revenue for the<br>government.<br><br>Although the supposed objective of the COE system was to regulate<br>traffic flow and reduce traffic congestion, a number of<br>characteristic reveal the actual COE scam which has the hidden<br>purpose of siphoning funds from car owners.<br><br>The scam is Revealed via the following formulae:<br><br>COE Revenue = COE Price X Number of COE issued.<br><br>Regardless of the price of the COE, the total COE revenue collected<br>remains generally stable at approx SGD1.994 billion. This is because<br>any fall in price is compensated by issuance of more COEs hence<br>keeping the COE revenue relatively stable.<br><br>Below are some of the characteristics of the COE scam:<br><br>1) The illusion created by the Scam is that the price of the COE<br>flustuates as a result of demand and supply. In reality Car Owners<br>are actually providing a buffer for the government and ensuring a<br>steady COE income stream.<br><br>2) The scam also effectively encourages Car Owners to scrap perfectly<br>good vehicles early. 3-4 year old cars in mint condition and<br>purchased at very high COE prices are scrapped early when COE prices<br>fall. With a greater number of vehicles "retired prematurely" the<br>government can then issue more COEs at lower prices creating the<br>illusion of a COE market that is driven by demand and supply.<br><br>In the above scenario, the constant that is maintained is the COE<br>revenue. In a market that is truly driven by Demand and Supply, a<br>fall in demand will eventually lead to a fall in supply which will<br>translate into reduced sales reveunes.<br><br>3) It is Impossible to actually own a car in Singapore.<br>To ensure continuity of the COE income stream, the PAP government has<br>effectively made freehold car ownership in Singapore impossible. Car<br>Owners never actually "own" the car per say, even after spending so<br>much money on a piece of paper, all they actually hold is a lease<br>giving them a conditional revocable right to drive a car for 10 years.<br><br>At the expiration of this lease, the COE certificate is either<br>renewed via payment of additional fees by current owner, or (in event<br>the old owner chooses not to renew the lease) it is "purchased" by a<br>new bidder. Either ways the PAP government is assured of a never<br>ending income stream.<br><br>4) The scam is also revealed when a car owner attempts to scrap<br>prematurely. The system does not allow the car owner a cash rebate on<br>the balance COE. Instead, the car owner has to purchase another car<br>(and another COE) and deduct his COE rebates from the final purchase<br>price. This ruse ensures that COE money remains with the government<br>even when a COE is scrapped prematurely, thus assuring them of a<br>steady income stream, albeit at the expense of car owners.<br><br>5) This ruse has been used successfully for over a decade in<br>conjunction with a series of other hidden "taxes" (like the ERP, CPF,<br>GST etc) all designed to provide a cheap and ready source of revenue<br>for undisclosed government activities.<br><br>6) The scam is given a veil of legitimacy with the support of laws<br>and regulations. The local government owned media regularly report<br>that the COE system "is tightly regulated and very competitive".<br><br>7) A plethora of technical terms are used also add layers to the scam<br>and hide the underlying ruse. Terms like "COE", "PARF", "ARF", "OMV"<br>etc.<br><br>The COE scam also works in conjunction with other scams and is part<br>of a more elaborate process. On top of the COE, car owners also have<br>to pay Road Tax (which is reasonable) and also ERP (Electronic Road<br>Pricing) which imposes a further cost for road usage.<br><br>So Car owners are penalized not just for leasing a car but also for<br>the road usage.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Other countries like Hong Kong also successfully control traffic<br>and the COE concept is conspicuously absent from these countries. In<br>fact in Hong Kong although there is a high cost to owning a car, this<br>is contained in the parking fees and charges which are paid to<br>landlords. The main difference here is that the parking fees are<br>collected by land lords and channeled back into the private sector.<br><br>In Singapore the COE revenues totaling SGD2 billion are channeled<br>directly into government coffers. No one knows what happens to this<br>massive amount of money.<br><br>9) How does the government justify the existence of such a system in<br>the first place? After years of implementation, the original<br>objective of the system (which was to control traffic congestion) has<br>long since been lost. Traffic jams are a common occurence all over<br>the island especially during peak hours and even the implementation<br>of additional penalties like the ERP have failed to address this<br>problem.<br><br>So what exactly are Singaporeans paying for when there is no concrete<br>proof for justification of the system? Such an obvious scam would<br>have risen many questioning eyebrows in other developed nations. But<br>here in Singapore part of the reason for the success in the deceit<br>lies in the social political circumstances which are unique only to<br>Singapore.<br><br>There is basically no accountability in government administration and<br>the political system effectively discourages any calls for<br>clarifications. Law suites are used as a convenient tool to silence<br>political opposition members and the international press.<br><br>After decades of indoctrination, local citizens have adopted a spirit<br>of apathy and unquestioning obedience to any enforced regulations and<br>policies. Indeed the government scammers are sound very legitimate.<br>They are usually polite, friendly, personable, sincere, convincing,<br>and controlling; formidable foes for more trusting average Car Owner.<br><br>10) Social and Psychological Indoctrination are important tools in<br>the scammers arsenal. In Singapore, a car has been portrayed by the<br>government as a "luxury item" in order to justify its high price.<br><br>On the other hand, government policies place immense pressure on<br>families to reproduce and more than one child. This, coupled with<br>uncertain employment (and high unemployment rates of 4.50% p.a.) have<br>necessitated dual income families with both spouses working long 12<br>hour work days. The hectic lifestyle and multiple roles of both<br>spouses (as wage earner, parents and care-takers of their own<br>parents) have rendered a car a very necessary asset.<br><br>11) Whilst the average con artist and scammer can be reported to the<br>authorities, how does one seek recourse when the local authorities<br>themselves are part of the elaborate hoax? The picture remains bleak<br>for Singaporeans as there seems no way out for them from this system.<br><br>12) According to a BBC article, not all scams are illegal by<br>definition. In fact some software scams are perfectly<br>legal. "Unscrupulous software suppliers have been taking advantage of<br>software license agreements to trick customers out of anything from<br>Â£10,000 to Â£100,000 plus. There is nothing illegal about it - some<br>of the world's largest software companies have been doing it to some<br>of the biggest companies in the world."<br>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/the_economy/365065.stm<br><br>The COE scam falls within this special category.<br><br></div>
