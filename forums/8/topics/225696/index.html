            <div class='col-md body'>Suiciders need to learn some basic courtesy as well... I think next time they should teach this in Moral Education in primary schools.... Committing suicide is a personal matter... If you decide to end your own life, by all means end it, but don't involve other people in the process... Why do you want to meddle with the public transport? There are so many other choices... You can jump off the building, slash your own wrist, pop down 34857394857923 panadols etc etc... All these methods of comitting suicide are known to many and they do not involve other people... Sometimes I really think that Singaporeans are blind trend-followers.... Even commit suicide also must follow trend... Sigh...</div>
