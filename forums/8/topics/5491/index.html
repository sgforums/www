            <div class='col-md body'>This topic may be totally irrelevant but I was just wondering how many of our Singapore girls r big fans or evemn listen to rock and metal(if there is any)? I'm not talking abt those mainstream rock grps that u hear on radio but more like bands such as Dream Theater, Yngwie Malmsteen, Cradle of Filth, Therion, Symphony-X, King Diamond, etc...

            <div class='col-md body'>Nah, Depeche Mode is more Pop than anything else. Looks like there aint't any that listen to metal. To me 90% of SG girls here r mostly into mainstream music which idolises pop icons(eg. boybands, R&amp;B artists or any gd looking singers). No offence intended, its just my personal opinion. =)<br><br>Peace,<br>SpookyKid<br><br>I look at the world and see no understanding</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Metalheads!<br><br>Naw...I dun think you'll find many gals who listen to metal. In the first place the metal genre is not even mainstream amongst guys! Let alone gals!<br><br>I mean metal is quite an extreme form of music (esp Black Metal) and its not really everyone's cuppa tea. I personaly took quite a while before I got used to the hard rockin heavy distortion sounds, plus incomprehensible vocals. Lyrics like this can be hard to swallow:<br><br>And to Her dead reflection<br>Twas as if Her pallor gleamed<br>Like an angel's warmed by candles<br>Where erotic stains had cleaved<br>So demons dragged this libertine<br>Lusts screaming for release<br>Upon the flesh of maidens preened<br>As canvas for caprice<br><br>(extract from "Cruelty Brought Thee Orchids" by Cradle of Filth)<br><br>Also, the image of metal has never been a respectable one. Its generally assoiciated with anguish, pessimissim, satanisam, sex, lust, violence, vulgarites etc etc to the extreme. In addition, the artists representing this genre are not very conventional in terms of looks, mannerism and image. Hardly a genre where "good" boys and gals would listen to if u ask me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Lastly I would attribute the lack of exposure as part of this problem. If metal were given more time on local radio (which up till this point of time should constitute 0%), perhaps you might see more sg gals (and guys) listen to this form of music. Moreover, you can't really walk into a CD shop and ask the storekeeper "Hey! Can I have a copy of Dimmu Borgir's latest album"<br><br>But ultimately, metal was born of the underground scene and should remain in there where it's sound can remain untouched by the influences of modern musical trends. Its a form of music not many would experience, but those who do will know the beauty behind the mayhem  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Heehee, must admit I oversteped the premesis of this topic a little (and I did have a slight biased towards Black metal in my arguments)! But the bottom line is there are not many gals who listen to metal, be it in sg or any part of the world!<br><br>Love and Peace.<br><br>(BTW...CoF's Cruelty and the Beast is a classic example of a great concept album! Do get it if u are a metalhead!)<br><br>------------------<br>************************<br>I do not embrace my dark side, but I do acknowledge it;<br>else I can never be whole</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi<br><br>Quite true, but I'm not really a fan of Black Metal (BM), but the music in Cruelty and the Beast was simply too good for me to ignore! I'm more a fan of Power Progressive Metal with groups like Iced Earth and Hammerfall. Mabe I'll take a closer look at some other BM groups when I have the time (and money)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Urm..I'm not too sure about malay gals listening to BM, but I do know that heavier music is more readily accepted by Malay youths. Just look at the pathetic state of the Mandarin music scene, nothing but lovey doey matters-of-the-heart ballads! I mean they sound nice...but too much of a good thing is bad (and in this case very bad...). Certainly its a trend but definately not part of their culture!<br><br>Eh, I thought From Cradle to Enslaved was an MTV? Not too sure about that EP, but I've seen the video tape around in several CD shops...along with a HUGE pricetag  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>DEATH TO FALSE METAL &lt;---- sorry, couldn't resist saying this bit  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>------------------<br>************************<br>I do not embrace my dark side, but I do acknowledge it;<br>else I can never be whole</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Great reply there Braveheart<br>But actually Black Metal is the current rage and is certainly thriving in the local underground scene now...all thanks to Cradle and Dimmu.<br>Look I'm not trying to discriminate or being a racisit...but there are alot of malay girls listening to black metal bands or even attending black metal gigs here in Spore.It all depends on the culture.<br>Anyway,did u manage to get Cradle's latest EP,'From the Cradle to the Enslave'? I ordered the CD from Roxy Music,but the censors decided to keep it to themselves.....damm!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi again<br><br>oops...forgot to say that I'm in melbourne now. But if u do come here, do check out a shoppe in the city called Metal Mayhem, got an impressive selection of metal albums (known and obscure).<br><br>But I believe you can order the EP through a local CD shop, it'll probably be able to get through the customs. Can't say the same for the MTV though  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> If I'm not wrong, HMV and Towers do stock up a little on these types of CDs, just have to be alert to notice them!<br><br>------------------<br>I do not embrace my dark side, but I do acknowledge it;<br>else I can never be whole<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually there r many kind of metal. Theres Black Metal(eg Cradle of Filth), Gothic Metal(eg Lycia), Death Metal(eg Napalm Death), Progressive Metal(eg Dream Theater), Neoclassical(Yngwie Malmsteen) and others just to name a few. The only similarity abt these diff genres of Metal is that they have real ass kicking distortion guitars!<br><br>Also not all Metal bands have "Satanic" influenced lyrics. For a gd clean, rock band check out Dream Theater. Its definately the best band in this decade. Maybe this century!! Too bad its not well known and luckily it stayed that way! Hehe. (I know its contradicting but u know what I mean!) So go check them out! Start with their first album(Images and Words) then their third album(Falling to Infinity) and followed by their current one(Metropolis Pt2:Scenes of a Memory).<br><br>Peace,<br>SpookyKid<br><br>I look at the world and see no understanding</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SpookyKid:<br><br>Yah! I agree with you that not all metal have satanic influneces, but I had to "generalise" all the sub-genres of metal into one.<br><br>Some metal bands MAKE referenes to satanic issues while some BASE their lyrics around satanism. Thus the various degree of influence is debatable here, depending on the sub-genre. Just curious; I've seen Heavy, Trash, Speed, Death, Doom, Industrial, Black, Symphonic, Punk metal just to name a few....anymore subgenres?<br><br>Actually the line between Metal and Rock is kinda blur; I mean both use the electric guitar intensively (rock does use heavy distortion at times), has fast and furious drums, and lotsa raw vocals. But what I'll say is that Metal music is definitely more POWER! Dat's y I prefer it over rock. But rock ballads do rank quite highly with me oso  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Haha! Ok! Will take mental note of your recommendation.<br><br>PS: Just wondering anyone of u play the electric guitar?

            <div class='col-md body'>Spooky:<br><br>Oh! I've tried Boon's before also. Adequate facilities I would say, but not that I've been to other local ones to mount a proper comparism anyway....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>True, but other than the brand name, subtle difference lies in the worksmanship (which is still top notch) and place of manufacture (which causes the great disparity in price). Such a pity Epiphone still cannot shake off the tag of "Poor-man's Gibson". They do manufacture an excellent range of guitars.<br><br>As to your query I'm an undergrad at the University of Melbourne now. And you?<br><br>As far as new musical instruments are concerned, I would say the price is quite comparable to Sg. But the variety here is certainly greater. The second hand market here is also very active (as opposed to sg) and one can pick up very good deals here! Just take a look at the number of guitars up for sale in the Melbourne Ad Post (Classified Ads)<br><br>Haha! "Channel Jammin", looks like you've just pionnered a new term if it does happen  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">.

I've just found out from my friend that Type O Negative belongs to Doom Metal while Black Sabbath is widely regarded as the founding fathers of the entire Metal Genre. They also planted the seeds for the birth of black metal which began in the 80s and has flourished ever since.<br><br>Now Metallica being metal has been the subject of great debate (among metalheads). I've only listened to their "Black" Album and found it, well, a little commercial for Metal. But I heard (ie hearsay) that the albums before "Black" were more "pure" to metal. Their works now are quite pale shadows of what they used to produce (from a Heavy Metal standpoint). But they do produce some nice rock ballads  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>------------------<br>I do not embrace my dark side, but I do acknowledge it;<br>else I can never be whole<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Braveheart:<br>Yup, Boons equipment r OK compared to the rest of the studios. However they do have two chio assistant working there, so thats one reason y we frequent there. Hahaha!! Anyway I'm currently in Ngee Ann Poly doing a diploma in Film, Sound and Video. Well actually my current band the members r all from an IRC channel. Hahaha! Btw we r looking for a bassist! So if u play the bass and have no band, come join us!! =)<br><br>lingirl:<br>Cool. Finally found one so I guess I may be wrong after all. Btw whats ur fav album from those band?? I still prefer the older stuffs from Metallica(when Dave Mustaine was still in the band) and Black Sabbath(the original line-up with Ozzy). Never really follow Type O Negative though so cant comment much abt them.<br><br>Peace,<br>SpookyKid<br><br>I look at this world and see no understanding</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, i followed Metallica only from the 'Black' album onwards, although ive heard that albums before that are the good ones and 'Justice' was really good. Personally, i find that albums after 'Black' isnt as bad as some might say, but opinions differ  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> and hey, the 'Garage' album has some pretty good songs .</div>

Anyway we play all kind of music, depending on what mood we have but we all kinda sux. All beginners.<br><br>lingirl:<br>The reason Garage was gd is because thats their old stuffs. Black album is gd but it signalled the start of the end of the progressive Metallica that they r formerly famous for. The old Metallica songs were at least 6 mins long and was a not a band whos songs were usually on air. Black was marketed to make them better known to the radio listening ppl. Load is frankly rubbish and well they Reload a bagful of rubbish. No offence to Metallica fans out there! =P<br><br>Peace,<br>SpookyKid<br><br>I look at this world and see no understanding</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>lingirl:<br>The diff between the genres of metal is just the mood and theme of the music. Eg. Gothic metal is more gloomy and "gothic" lyrics compared to lets say death metal, which has "drums which double pedal like theres no tomorrow" and usually has a "satanic" theme to it.<br>Progressive metal is music with lots of diff time signatures and melodies in one song. Well heres some list of band that I would recommend to ppl, Dream Theater, Yngwie Malmsteen, Symphony X and Liquid Tension Experiment.<br><br>Peace,<br>SpookyKid<br><br>I look at this world and see no understanding</div>
