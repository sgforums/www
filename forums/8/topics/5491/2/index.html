            <div class='col-md body'>lingirl and spooky:<br><br>Hmm..afraid I do not really know how to define "Power Progressive Metal" (PPM), but I thougt it has something to do with the added keyboard effects.  The keyboard plays alongside the usual electric and drums (plus the often heard but seldom seen bass). The effect is that power progressive sounds more "grand" than regular metal. The vocals in PPM are usually also clean and clear, and are of very good standards (they can easily give their contemporarys in mainstream music a run for their money). Also, most of their themes are not so dark.<br><br>Perhaps you can call them "mainstreamed metal" cuz its easy for mainstream listeners to appreciate it, yet it does not compromise their metal roots.<br><br>I got started on that genre by HAMMERFALL. Try out "Glory to the Brave", their first Album. Their second album (Legacy of Kings) is oso not bad...but I still prefer their first, in part due to the superb ballad of the same title 'Glory to the Brave'    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>"Nothing on Earth lasts forever<br>But none of your deeds were in vain<br>Deep in our hearts you will live again<br>You've gone to the Home of the Brave"<br><br>-- 'Glory to the Brave' by Hammerfall<br><br>------------------<br>I do not embrace my dark side, but I do acknowledge it;<br>else I can never be whole<br><br>[This message has been edited by Bravehart (edited 29-11-1999).]</div>

Of course there are exceptions in life; but I seriously dun think you belong to that category  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>lingirl:<br><br>King Diamond. Must admit I have not heard of it.<br><br>*notes it down for future listening*<br><br>The characteristics I mentioned were purely based on my personal opinion. To be honest I have not listened to that much metal to be a real guru on it (in fact I appreciate it more from a guitarist standpoint), so what I said may be subjective and debatable.<br><br>As for metal on air, I really do not think we would see it anytime soon. I guess there's this perception that Metal is a form of music relavent as Graffiti is to Art. Unless we can get a metal group as influential as the Beatles, think things will remain as it is for sometime to come...<br><br>I'm sure there are tons of excellent metal bands out there, but as I mentioned that metal is essentially an underground act. Thus exposure is quite limited. More often than not, exposure leads to commercialisation (re: Metallica) and such a band leaves its metal roots behind and opt for more mainstream material.<br><br>Consider it a tradeoff if you would  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>------------------<br>I do not embrace my dark side, but I do acknowledge it;<br>else I can never be whole<br></div>

These two bands r great metal bands from the 80s.<br><br>Braveheart:<br>Its cool that u appreciate the guitar playing of these bands. So who is ur fav guitarist(s)??<br><br>Anyway since its the end of the century and millenium shit. Cant help but ask u ppl whats ur dream band line-up. Heres mine:<br><br>Dream rock&amp;metal band:<br>Vocals: Michael Matijevic(Steelheart)<br>Guitars: John Petrucci(Dream Theater)<br>Guitars: Yngwie Malmsteen<br>Bass: Billy Sheehan(Mr Big)<br>Drums: Mike Portnoy(Dream Theater)<br>Keyboards: Kevin Moore(ex-DT)<br><br>Dream alternative band:<br>Vocals: Thom Yorke(Radiohead)<br>Guitars: Billy Corgan(Smashing Pumpkins)<br>Guitars: Noel Gallagher(Oasis)<br>Bass: Flea(RHCP)<br>Drums: Dave Grohl(Foo Fighters,ex-Nirvana)<br><br>So what do u guys think? I wonder what kinda stuff will they come out with if they ever collaborated. The way I came up with these line up is by the merits of technicality(how gd they play the instruments) and creativity.<br><br>Peace,<br>SpookyKid</div>

Ito's playing really reminds me of Slash and ELT has some really nice ballads with All Along and Time Goes By being my fav. Eric Clapton well he's influenced like everybody so that goes without saying.<br><br>tuonela:<br>Sorrie man my spelling not so gd. Metallica's S&amp;M the album not bad. But the orchestra didnt really play a great part in the album. Just added a few parts here and there. Somemore the album quite exp ah. I heard that there is a Metallica concert VCD selling at Pasar Malams. Havent seen it yet but I think its a buyable item(if u don mind buying pirated stuffs that is).<br><br>aRiaNA:<br>Cool that u listen to Malmsteen and its gd to have a variety in music. Yup, Malmsteen's new album Alchemy is really gd. Must get album for 99!! Check out Blitzkerig, Leonardo and Asylum. Some of the great tracks from the album.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi ppl!<br><br>I was thinking of getting into some of Kitaro's music ("music rotation" so as not to get sick of the same genre all the time). Anyone has any particular recommendation?<br><br>tuonela:<br><br>Your most welcome! Though I got reprimanded by my fren from Leeds again; he said that the album sucked big time and I should have warned you against buying it. Guess one man's food is another man's poison; Hope u enjoyed it!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Wow! $40???!?! Double CD I presume? To be honest, I only go to Towers/HMV to sample the new albums before buying them at MJ or Sembawang Music.....Cheapskate huh?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Spooky:<br><br>Actually I like the 3 "front-men" of X-Japan (Yoshiki, Hide and Toshi). I admire Yoshiki more for his songwriting/arrangment abilities, IMHO he X-Japan's greatest asset. Heard he's a producer for a group named Dir~en~Grey now; looks like the legacy of X-Japan still lives on  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Hide's playing is just so wonderful that it makes you sit up the moment he breaks into his solo. A pity he committed suicide; but I suppose that's how legends are made.... I also enjoy Toshi's vocals, rough and rhapsy yet full of power and emotion.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Yup! Have to agree with you on Slash's and Ito's similiarity in style! Unfortunately most of the Asian guitarists seem to be labled 2nd fiddle to their western counterparts. I mean they are excellent guitarists in their own right, but often they dun seem to get due recognition. If you have heard Japanese rock or China rock, you'll be quite surprised at the high standards of the guitar arrangemens and execution.<br><br>As for Clapton, what has been said of him that hasn't been said  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> He's a living legend!<br><br>Madd:<br><br>You live in Melbourne too? Nice to meet ya  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Where's Chapel Street, is it that very up-market place?

            <div class='col-md body'>I sense a great increment of metal and rock fans in singapore all of a sudden. Can't help but say it.<br><br>I've been a rock and metal fan for god knows when...but to me , i believe in 1 thing<br><br>"Rock never dies..."<br><br>Bands like Skid Row, Slaughter, Metallica (ONLY THE OLD ALBUMS), Megadeth and not forgetting PANTERA will always be the few best rock and metal stuff that i've ever heard.<br><br>It really suprises me that there are gals out there who listen to such stuff and even know who Malmsteen is...hmm...next thing u know...Ariana might even know that Malmsteen's guitar neck frets are all SUNKEN.... which makes his bending and vibrato of his guitar sound so fantastic.<br><br>Hail to rock and metal!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Braveheart:<br>Kitaro eh? I have the Live in America LD and Kokoro is one hell of a great song. Nice guitar riffs and solo. Thats rite, too bad Hide's dead if not I think X-Japan can make some sort of reunion album or concert. And yes sadly most of the great Asian guitarisr r labelled as 2nd fiddles but I think the reason they r labelled that way cause the ang mohs did it first before them. However there is this one band, Loudness, also a Japanese heavy metal band which is one of the few asian rock bands that made it big in the west. Its main man and guitarist Akira Takasaki is revered as one of the best guitarist around(well during that time anyway)! Yup I do listen to some of Japanese and Chinese rock even though I am not Japanese or Chinese. I listen to bands like Glay, Lunasea, L'arc~en~Ciel, Malice Micer, Beyond, etc... and yup their song arrangement and mix is really gd and tight. Great job done by the producers, engineers and the bands themselves and I think Japan really have some fantastic studios. Thats y J-Rock and J-Pop really sounds gd(and also another reason y their CDs printed in Japan are so exp!!!).<br><br>Kenshin:<br>Thats rite, "Rock Never Dies!" and the bands that u mention r some of the best bands there is. However they r still more bands(frm that era) like Warrant, Mr Big, Europe, Def Leppard, Whitelion, Whitesnake, Iron Maiden, and lots more that are worth mentioning! Btw the term that is used for the special frets that Malmsteen uses is SCALLOPED.<br><br>aRiaNa:<br>Hey u r rite! Hes really a modern-day Paganini that plays the guitar instead of violin! The reason his playing is diff frm others is because he started his own kind of music, Neo-classical. Btw ur the first ever girl that I know of that listen to Malmsteen. So I guess the question that I originally ask has finally been answered. Haha!<br><br>Peace,<br>SpookyKid<br><br>I look at this world and see no understanding</div>

But now he has lost a few of those extra pounds and looks abit better. His playing got better because of that too. So whats the made of ur guitar??
