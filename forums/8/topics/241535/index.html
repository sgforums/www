            <div class='col-md body'>From Asd Spore<br>Will:<br>What is the meaning of my life ? I was born on this man-made island, made up of metal machines and structures, relentlessly working day and night. It is a dog-eat-dog world out there, for food is scarce, and I am always hungry. Life here is hell and I saw many of my friends die from hunger, disease, poison, and some crushed by the many metal machines that hurtle past<br><br>Is this an existence or a life ? I have lots of love to give but who would stop to give me a look or pat me on the head for I am a lowly stray, born without choice, life without voice, destroyed at will. I eke out my life as best as I can, a day at a time, always living for the present<br><br>Life has always been a dance of death, and that fateful day, the deafening roar of a metal machine boring down on me was the cresendo of my departure from this life ... Or so I thought ... Sharp, excruciating pain woke me up and sliced thru my consciousness like a throat being slit, and I could only cry and whimper ... But in my dark and lonely world, who will listen ?<br><br>I now have no sensation in my lower back and am numb from shock, but the horror of bloody, mangled stumps in place of my hind legs hit me like a brick wall. Frightened and disoriented, I could only drag myself around until I collasped out of sheer exhaustion, my body broken, my spirit destroyed and dispair overwhelms me ... It is finished ...<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>In Oct 06, we received a call from a security guard on Jurong Island that there was a dog without hind legs ... It seemed at that time that it was another highly exaggerated call, as we were told there was no bleeding or external wounds visible. Another call came in shortly describing the same scenario, and we knew it had to be true, though we did not understand how a dog with such a handicap could survive the harsh environment.<br>The difficult part was getting into Jurong Island with its high security, but fortunately, the guard was able to arrange for our transport to go in. When we got there, Will was sitting quietly at the sentry booth, a handsome boy of about 1 year, eyes fearful yet hopeful; he did not run away from us, but allowed us to carry him. He did not bark, growl or whine, but his expressive eyes emnated the pain and the suffering he was going through. We decided to name him Will for his sheer will and courage to survive ...<br><img src="http://www.asdsingapore.com/images/stories/cry/cry_will1.jpg"><br>The magnitude of his injuries shook us for his hind legs were missing from the scrotum level and his backside, scrotum and stumps were raw from him dragging his body around. The guard told us that he had been missing for about a month and had recently re-appeared without his hind legs. He had also fallen into a drain and was there for 3 days till the guard found him. How he managed to survive a month on his own in his state and not have his infected limbs kill him still remains a mystery and a miracle ...<br><img src="http://www.asdsingapore.com/images/stories/cry/cry_will2.jpg"><br>Throughout his ordeal, Will allowed the doctors and nurses to handle him without any fuss or fanfare, never growling or crying out in pain. He was the nurses' favourite patient during his stay there. Will's luck seemed to change for the better, for at the same time, Leng, our long time fosterer and a lady with a heart of gold, called to say she could take another 'special needs' dog as one of hers had just passed on due to old age. Will could not have gotten a better deal (of course he would have liked to keep his legs), for he was incontinent and needed constant care and Leng had vast experience with dogs like him and had the heart to help.<br>Now time will tell to see how Will's injuries heal and how he will adjust to his handicap<br>Side note : The number of strays on Jurong Island are increasing because there is no support of the sterilization program that ASD proposed. Pest Control companies and the pound people go in regularly to round them up to be put down and there have been reports that methods used involved poison<br>Mentally and emotionally, Will seemed to have no problems adapting to a domesticated life. He was always cheerful and friendly with his care givers and has a voracious appetite. He loves his treats to bits and he welcomes that all times of the day ! He tries to make friends with his other feline companions but they gang up on him  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> !<br>And every 2 weeks or so, it would be off to the vet for a review to see Will's progress. Sadly, Will will remain incontinent permanently as there had been damage to the spinal chord, but he has learnt to be as clean as he can, always moving to a different corner once he realized he had soiled himself. In the span of 2 months or so, Will's wounds had healed well and completely and we comtemplate the next stage of his life ...<br><img src="http://www.asdsingapore.com/images/stories/cry/cry_will5.jpg"><br><br></div>

He was young, energetic and cheerful and curious. It would be a pity if he had to spend the rest of his life on a bed. The idea of a wheelchair much like the one done for Kara (read about Kara here) came about and we did a bit of research before contacting a US company about the possibility of customising one for him<br><br>The folks at Doggone' Wheels were helpful and knowing we were a non-profit organization, customised a refurbished (cheaper) wheelchair for him. The wheelchair finally made its way to us after about 2 weeks of emails and measurements and we were really excited about having Will try out his wheels<br><br>That day, we brought Will his wheels. He sniffed at it and decided it wasn't food and ignored it. We took a while adjusting the front and back harness and strapping it onto him and finally hooking him up to his wheels. Initially he didn't know what to do, so he just sat down.<br><br>We coaxed him and helped him with a few steps and slowly he learnt to lean his body weight forward so that the wheels would support his back. He walked a few tentative steps on his own, and then he was off ! Relishing his new found freedom he raced around the garden, smelling the flowers and the grass, and was more adept at avoiding a collision than the humans who were trying to film him !<br><img src="http://www.asdsingapore.com/images/stories/cry/cry_will8.jpg"><br>He was all smiles and would have wagged his tail if he could, but his eyes said it all and we were just as happy for him ! Will gets to ride his wheels everyday now for a period of 5-15 minutes to allow him to build up strength in his front legs to help support the rest of his body<br><br><img src="http://www.asdsingapore.com/images/stories/cry/cry_will7.jpg"><br><br>Will's life has changed drastically and he has literally come back from the dead. With constant companionship, good food and treats, and his cheerful demeanour, Will now has the chance to be man's best friend and he is definitely a natural at that !<br><img src="http://www.asdsingapore.com/images/stories/cry/cry_will9.jpg"><br><br></div>
