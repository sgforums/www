            <div class='col-md body'>how the utility charge you is by  KW/h (kilowatts per hour)<br><br>So if your appliances is using power (wattages), there is a current flow and thus you will be charged for that usage.<br><br>e.g. The wall socket switch is on, the fan is connected to it, the fan has no lights, fan is off. = No power consumed.<br><br>e.g. The wall socket switch is on, the fan is connected to it, the fan has lights to indicate that there is electricity powering the fan. But the fan is not in use.<br>There IS power consumed, but just to light up that LED light which is in the region of 0.01 W or lesser. You will need to keep the light on for 10 million hours before you hit 1 kilowatt.<br><br>For PC is a different case, PC nowadays maintain a standby state to prevent ROM loss. They take in very small current to charge the battery on the motherboard. Again this is very small current.<br><br>But when your PC is on, it will take quite abit of power, in the region of 250-500 W depending on your computer set up.<br><br>The appliances that take up most power are usually, Water Heater, Iron, Air Con, Oven, Microwave and a accumulation of light bulbs/tubes.</div>
