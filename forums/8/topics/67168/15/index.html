            <div class='col-md body'><br>LOL. You guys are all so CUTE!<br><br>Lets not get into drawn into a whole debate about poly vs JC students. Thats not what this thread is about. BUt just a little point: i totally agree with you that JC students are muggers. But there are tons of poly students who mug like hell too. As for onhands experience, of course that is impt. But there are many JC students ( like myself) who go out and work whenever they can.<br><br>I am not being a snob here, just verifiying that i am NOT rob. If i was a snob, i wouldnt even post.<br><br>Just look at it this way: An education overseas is very expensive. Many singaporeans are pretty well-off middle class families, but it is expensive nonetheless. A lousy institution/university is a waste of money. Being ranked "3rd" rate shows that its teaching, facilities and opportunities are much, much less then other better unis. Sure, it depends on the individual, but like the tabula rasa (for those who do not know, this theory was conceptualised by Thoreau) man is affected by his surroundings. Soif you go to a mediocre school, the majority will turn out mediocre students.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>heres another point for u all to consider. many so-called top unis like IC, Oxford and others, do not offer the more specialised course like the one i am taking. so my paying money to go to the uni because it is one of the few which do offer the course i want i stupid? a waste of money? means i am 3rd rate? not worthy of leading anything or anyone?<br>oh come on.... this elitist attitude really sucks. with people like that running the country, and producing a whole new batch of moulded, almost clone-like elitists, it is no wonder our future looks bleak.</div>
