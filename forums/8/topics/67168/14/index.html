            <div class='col-md body'>Fine, you post your evidence, and I'll treat it as a proper argument even if I don't agree.  Even with little Robbie, I've made a point to hold a proper debate with him as long as he presented evidence - it's only when he came up with the "third-rate universities" nonsense that proper rules of engagement were dropped.<br><br>Just to clarify, for me, this isn't a matter of ego - I already have a degree from a sandstone university, so that ought to put me on Litle Robbie's side of the argument.<br><br>The danger of this "third-rate universities" line of argument is that future students will do themselves a disservice by believing it, and turning up at university expecting a walkover, completely unprepared to work.  Look at the TER cutoffs of some of the universities that our boy has listed as third-rate - those students will be in for a rude shock if they walk in there with the wrong mentality.</div>
