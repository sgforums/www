            <div class='col-md body'>ok, i found this in the website. based on their "mission", i think the ranking is quite accurate.<br><br>Mission<br><br>Many students, faculties, institutions, governments and the public in general are interested in rankings of universities for different purposes. However, the quality or reputation of universities cannot be precisely measured by mere numbers. It would be impossible to quantitatively evaluate universities worldwide, because of the huge differences of universities in the large variety of countries and the technical difficulties in obtaining internationally comparable data.<br><br>Two years ago, we decided to establish some kind of academic ranking of universities worldwide by evaluating their academic or research performance. After two years of hard work, we come up with the "Academic Ranking of World Universities - 2003". We hope the ranking will help you to compare and identify universities worldwide by their academic or research performance.<br></div>

What I've written is clear enough for anyone with the half-ounce of brains you lack.  First, I made the distinction between undergrad and postgrad already, and explained how universities differ in the priorities that place on either - you factor that into your selection of universities.  Second, I have already described how the emphasis on postgrad but not undergrad has produced undergrads with somewhat less than stellar performance - those students were wasted on such a system.  And third, you ignorant little turd, Melbourne offered a doctorate in Organisational Psychology that Swinburne did not.  The only other university offering a similar course was Monash, and the program was only in its first year, with a lot of bugs to be ironed out.  That's normal for new courses, but you wouldn't know that would you?<br><br></div></blockquote><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I never cared to know the details your degree advancement progress or the options you have or not because it didnÂ¡Â¯t matter.  </span><strong>Especially since you criticize the sandstone on how useless or 1sided the courses and pupils are,</strong> <span style="color: red;">you should have entered another newbie university with Â¡Â®easy standards and easy examsÂ¡Â¯ again for your post grad degree to stand by your opinions (regardless of what options of courses or lack of them) rather than join the Gp of Eight for post grad.  </span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">There are many 3rd rate Univs, if not in Victoria, can go up north to NSW or Queensland or left side to SA!  e.g. UniSA, Western Sydney, Central Queensland also quite lax in standards</span>, <strong>why donÂ¡Â¯t try if they have PhD programmes that suit u that can produce enhanced psychos?  </strong><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Come on donÂ¡Â¯t lie to yourself it is Â¡Â®hindsightÂ¡Â¯Â¡Â­.!  Your opinion were already formed while in those easy exam university, </span><strong>doing post grad in an established Univ is only for your personal advantage.  </strong><br><br><span style="color: red;">btw, Psychology , even for PhD isnÂ¡Â¯t rocket science, Elec Engr, Economics or Physics,  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  :lol</span>: so stop portraying yourself as superior or reminding people of your doctor status.<br><br>Wow, going personal hey, I m trembling!!!<br><br>Whether I have Hons degree or not is the same as you whether u have PhD, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all Â¡Â®we claim - we sayÂ¡Â¯, donÂ¡Â¯t believe then Â¡Â®sua lorÂ¡Â¯, everybody here want to believe or not is up to oneself, </span>beside, <strong> BTW, with Â¡Â®your overall feelÂ¡Â¯ to me, u are probably only be a <span style="color: blue;">Poly grad that speaks dialect all day long! And enter Poly not by choice of NOT wishing to go JC due to poor CL and EL results </span>but because of NO CHOICE but to go poly.</strong><br><br><strong>my opinion is Â¨C I donÂ¡Â¯t see any difference between a Poly grad and a Poly grad that later achieve a degree, Master or PhD from a newbie univ that just confer degrees as long as one enroll and pay fees (b it from US, UK or Aust).  </strong><span style="color: darkblue;">I STILL RESPECT ANYONE THAT GETS THEIR degrees from a more established Univ with a reasonable standard of entry requirements and difficulty in examinations, esp. in those established betore the 60s. </span><br><br><span style="color: red;">Yeah, who knows your UMÂ¡Â¯s claim is true or not?</span>  <strong>Blow more airÂ¡Â­..AGAIN Â¡Â­ I am always very impressed  HA HA! </strong></div>

For example, RMIT got a score of 51.94, which will place it 55th in the multi-discpilinary UNIs list, which means it out-ranked schools such as Maquarie, La trobe, Deakin and others.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote><strong>Big Lie!!!

            <div class='col-md body'>hohoho, hello Mr Rob Chen.<br><br>Firstly, please check your own english before saying other people cannot understand simple english lah... I have to admit lah, I am from a 3rd rate university with a poly diploma lah, I cannot go NUS or NTU lah and my english only C6 standard, so please tolerate with me lah hoh...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Secondly, if you equate easy admission = easy programs, then I think you are wrong lah... like me, I can also choose not to go to a<br>" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"> 3rd rate" university, but how come i choose to go to a it leH? because they have better syllabus.. simple reason rite? I think the case is same as Gedanken lah, if want to do research, of course choose a university with an established research program rite? Since you are so intelligent, you would have done the same if you are in his shoes, am I not correct?<br><br>Thirdly, please take a look at the 2004 Financial Times ranking of the top 100 global MBAs at the link i've provided at the top of the fifth page. QUT at 82nd leh, not that 3rd rate ritE? or your definition of 3rd rate is based entirely on that SHJT ranking that you provided? You kept saying that the Good University Guide is crap, that Asiaweek ranking is crap, so what makes that SHJT ranking not crap leh? Even results from professionals are discredited by you liao leh... no one to turn to liao loh...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Nowadays, i think easy entry is not a reflection of the university quality lah. i have a friend who got her bachelor and masters at a uni in UK. I don't know in your eyes that uni is good or not lah, but i think it is above average loh since people from SHJT and Tsinghua also go apply for their Masters program. But the thing is, they also cannot speak english leh... you know how they get in? they buy their way in... hehehe....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  In cases like this, the university have to accept lah, coz' govt. never provide alot of funding mah... of course must find way to survive through international students loh...<br>simple logic rite?<br><br>lastly lah hoh, maybe you think what i've typed above are all nonsense lah, but then I hope that you can answer this question lah hoh, since you so clever from so elite university...<br><br><strong>Which university are you from?</strong><br><br>Shouldn't be too hard lah hoh, for a person of your intellect</div>
