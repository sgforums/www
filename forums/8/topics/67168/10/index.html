I have to admit lah, I am from a 3rd rate university with a poly diploma lah, I cannot go NUS or NTU lah and my english only C6 standard, so please tolerate with me lah hoh...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Secondly, if you equate easy admission = easy programs, then I think you are wrong lah... like me, I can also choose not to go to a<br>" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"> 3rd rate" university, but how come i choose to go to a it leH? because they have better syllabus.. simple reason rite? I think the case is same as Gedanken lah, if want to do research, of course choose a university with an established research program rite? Since you are so intelligent, you would have done the same if you are in his shoes, am I not correct?<br><br>Thirdly, please take a look at the 2004 Financial Times ranking of the top 100 global MBAs at the link i've provided at the top of the fifth page. QUT at 82nd leh, not that 3rd rate ritE? or your definition of 3rd rate is based entirely on that SHJT ranking that you provided? You kept saying that the Good University Guide is crap, that Asiaweek ranking is crap, so what makes that SHJT ranking not crap leh? Even results from professionals are discredited by you liao leh... no one to turn to liao loh...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Nowadays, i think easy entry is not a reflection of the university quality lah. i have a friend who got her bachelor and masters at a uni in UK. I don't know in your eyes that uni is good or not lah, but i think it is above average loh since people from SHJT and Tsinghua also go apply for their Masters program. But the thing is, they also cannot speak english leh... you know how they get in? they buy their way in... hehehe....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  In cases like this, the university have to accept lah, coz' govt. never provide alot of funding mah... of course must find way to survive through international students loh...<br>simple logic rite?<br><br>lastly lah hoh, maybe you think what i've typed above are all nonsense lah, but then I hope that you can answer this question lah hoh, since you so clever from so elite university...<br><br>[b]Which university are you from?</strong><br><br>Shouldn't be too hard lah hoh, for a person of your intellect[/b]</blockquote>aiyah, rob ciao liao ah? sian leh...... Anyway, Mr Rob Chen, please enlightened us on which elite uni you are from leh... why don't you want to say? I already say I am from those '3rd' rate uni liao leh.<br><br>You so intelligent can study 1st rate world class master of the universe university, confirm can answer us where you are from rite........ don't siam leh... or if you don't understand siam, it means don't dodge leh.. answer the question.<br><br>At least for my personal curiosity  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  Cheers</div>

But, I still see colours so very often.<br>5) Out of 10 posts from you. At least half of them are repeated cut and paste phrases (Though the colours may be different).<br>6) Those '3rd rate unis' which you quote them to be are more sort after than your 'top' unis, that alone deserves credit.<br><br></div>
