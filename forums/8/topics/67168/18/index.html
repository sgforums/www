            <div class='col-md body'>You want to know what the funny thing is?  Except for the point about "third-rate" unis, we don't disagree.<br><br>I don't believe in using the prestigious / third rate system because at the end of the day, there might well be a very good department or faculty in a so-called third-rate university that students will miss out on because of this blind system.<br><br>A classic case is Heng - he wants to study a subject that very few people want to take, and even fewer universities offer.  He's doing what he's deeply passionate about, so why should anyone rain on his parade by writing him off as being from a third-rate university?<br><br>On top of that, chengleton not only provides an argument but presents the entrance requirements to some of RMIT's courses, to show how the "third-rate university" reputation is a malicious myth.<br><br>This "third rate" nonsense is crux of the matter.  This of course raises the question of why I'm flaming you.<br><br>Note my post on page 14 of this thread, posted on 26/2/04 at 02:39.  I asked for you to present evidence, you did, and I thanked you and provided a critique of the articles that you posted.  You never replied to that, and in subsequent posts wrote of my flaming Rob Chen.<br><br>So you do not address a civilised response to your post, but instead focus upon the controversial elements of this thread - it certainly looks like you are spoiling for a fight.  On top of that, if you wish to defend Rob, be prepared to draw the fire that was going his way, especially in his absence - of course ,then, you are getting the same thing from me as Rob did.  That may not be the stance you hold, but it certainly is the one you are presenting.  Some others have spoken up before presenting Rob's side of the argument, but in a more moderate and focussed manner - why don't you ask yourself why they have not drawn fire while you have?<br><br>Of course my attacks lack class.  I really don't know how many times I have to say that this is deliberate.  The best thing about being a gentleman is knowing when to stop being one, not letting the expected restraint become a liability in an uncivilised situation..  You know I was a commando, and if you did know anything about us, the first thing is that we can, and will, switch modes very rapidly and completely according to the situation.  Obviously you've done a bit of looking, and perhaps you may have seen instances of my treating other posters in a completely different way to what I have done with Rob.  Whether you choose to disreagrd that or not is of course entirely up to you.<br><br>On the A's and O's issue, I went with what you wrote - it was a response to your statement about not having received your A-level results yet.</div>

My last post contained no personal attacks, and was in effect a ceasefire, although you of course have the right to interpret it as megalomania.  Similarly, you did not respond in kind when I wound my neck in the last time, as cited in my last post.  The evidence is here for all to see.<br><br>In any case, you have not responded to either of those posts, and instead returned a personal attack to barkhide.  What are the rest of us to think then, when we see this exchange?  For all intents and purposes, it appears that you wish to engage in a flame war.<br><br>My ceasefire status still stands.  Like I said, you may interpret that as megalomania and continue on your current path, in which case you have justified the flaming you receive.  Alternatively, you can take advantage of the ceasefire and set things on the right track.  I've made my move - the ball's in your court now.</div>
