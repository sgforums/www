            <div class='col-md body'>Okay Rob Chen, I think it is clear from some of the outrageous and totally unqualified things you have said, that you have a very limited knowledge of Australian universities.<br><br>Firstly, the top 500 universities list produced by Shanghai Jiatong University, only included universities with nobel prize laureates, thus, quality universities such as QUT and RMIT are not present.<br><br>Also, according to the 2004 "good universities guide", the only guide produced in Australia by Australians, that rates all Australian universities, RMIT rates 4 stars in prestige, non-government funding, graduate outcomes, as well as student selectivity. This puts it second only to the "group of eight" universities that you admire so much and profess to know so much about. QUT, UTS, University of South Australia Macquarie and Flinders University were all rated on a par with RMIT. Other universities such as Deakin and La trobe scored 3 stars or less, across all fields.<br><br>You also say that universities such as RMIT and QUT have low cut-offs, well i can tell you that this is not the case. Last year, I was issued a VTAC (Victorian Tertiary Admissions Centre) guide when I was completing my VCE studies, and according to this guide, cut-offs for RMIT were at least on a par, if not higher, than supposedly more prestigious universities such as Monash and ANU. Using local knowledge, I can tell you that RMIT is very well respected, true it may not have the history of Melbourne or UNSW, but its strength lies in the relavance of its courses to the world of work, and the practical experiences it offers students. 90+ per cent employment rate among its graduates is a testiment to that.<br><br>Rob Chen, you should not judge a university by one set of rankings. It is obvious that you have little idea of the Australian education environment, so rather than mouthing off and telling everyone that universities such as "QUT and RMIT are third rate", you should check your facts and do some research first!<br><br></div>
