            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Shanghai Jiao Tong University recently published a ranking of world Top 500 universities.<br><br>I personally think it is quite a good gauge of Univs around the world.  A real <strong>Â¡Â®CLASH OF THE TITANSÂ¡Â¯ since most in World Top 500 (especially top 300) are all very prestigious Univs </strong>(at least in their own region/country).  This can be a useful guide for Singaporeans wishing to enroll in prestigious universities abroad.  Some Prestigious Univs of Europe, Australia and Asia also do outperform some prestigious American Univs.<br><br>Since Â¡Â®Middle EastÂ¡Â¯ is in fact West Asia &amp; majority of Turkey is in Asia Minor, not Europe, Israel and Turkey Univs are classified under Asia and placed under Â¡Â®Asian / PacificÂ¡Â¯ category.  There are also 3 lists of top 100 of Asian / Pacific (i.e. Asia or Oceania), America (North &amp; South America: US, Brazil, Mexico, Canada) and Europe Universities.<br><br><strong>POINT TO NOTE</strong>:<br>Only World Top 100 Univs (some are jointly ranked) are ranked specifically, e.g. no. 67 or 88.  Top 102 to 500 are ranked in categories/groups of around 50 <strong>listed alphabetically</strong>.  E.g. the 102-151 category &amp; 451-500 etc.<br><br>WORLDÂ¡Â¯S TOP 50:<br>Harvard, Stanford and Caltech occupy Top 3 position.  Cambridge is 5 and Oxford at 9.  <strong>Countries having top 50 Univ are:  Australia, Austria, Finland, Germany, Canada, Denmark, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, UK and US</strong>.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Highest Ranked Asian U is Tokyo U at 19</span>.  <strong>Highest ranked German Univ is Munich at 48<br>Highest ranked Oceania (Pacific) Univ is Australian National Univ (ANU) which together with US Ivy LeagueÂ¡Â¯s Brown Univ are jointly ranked at 49.</strong><br><br>WORLDÂ¡Â¯S TOP 51-100:<br>Being in World Top 50, German and AustraliaÂ¡Â¯s Top U also outrank some famous American Univs e.g. New York U (53), Carnegie Mellon U and Rice U (joint 61), U of Virginia (67), Tufts U (83), Boston U (ninety eight) and Emory U (99).<br><br>Other top UK/Australia Unis in World top 100 are: Bristol, Kings College London, U of Manchester and U of Melbourne.<br><br>ASIA: ONLY 2 COUNTRIES INSIDE TOP 100<br>Asia only has Japan in World Top 50.  Only 2 nations under Asia have Univs ranked in Worlds Top 100:  <strong>Israel and Japan</strong>.  IsraelÂ¡Â¯s top U, Hebrew U Jerusalem is ranked at 94.<br><br>MAINLAND CHINA:<br><strong>PR ChinaÂ¡Â¯s most prestigious Tsing Hua is also ranked highest in this ranking: Tsing Hua is in 201-250 group</strong>, followed by Peking U in 251-300 and Fudan and Nanjing in group 301-350.  Shang Hai Jiao Tong which did the ranking is in 401-450.<br><br>PACIFIC (OCEANIA) Univs:<br><strong>There are 9 Prestigious Pacific Univs listed in World Top 250, AustraliaÂ¡Â¯s elite Â¡Â®Group of EightÂ¡Â¯ and New ZealandÂ¡Â¯s U of Auckland</strong>:  Besides ANU (49) and Melbourne (93) are in World Top 100, the other 6 of AustraliaÂ¡Â¯s prestigious Â¡Â®Group of EightÂ¡Â¯ Univs are in the 102-151 category: Sydney, Queensland, 152-200 category: Monash, UWA (Western Australia) &amp; UNSW (New South Wales) and 201-250 category: U of Adelaide.   U of Auckland (Top ranked of New Zealand) is also in 201-250 group.<br><br>Australia/NZ Unis in the Pacific are popular amongst Singaporeans.  However, most Singaporeans grad/students are not from those abovementioned prestigious Aust/NZ Uni.  Many were MERELY from 3rd rate Â¡Â®easy entry-easy examsÂ¡Â¯ Australian Univs that were formerly polytechnics/institutes converted into Univ only in late 80s/1990s e.g. Curtin, RMIT, Central Queensland, Queensland U of Tech etc) OR average ones like Deakin, Murdoch, Griffith Â¨C all which are not in the World Top 500 list.<br><br><strong>FOR COMPARISON PURPOSE</strong><br>(Mainly from Top Univs in UK/US/Japan/China, Top Australian Univs within World Top 250 like Sydney, UWA, Adelaide were already mentioned above and not repeated here)<br><br>Some Univs in 102-151 group are:<br>Dartmouth (Ivy League, US), Nottingham (UK), Glasgow (UK), Georgia Insti of Tech (US), Birmingham (UK), Leeds (UK) , Baylor Coll Med (US), U of Milan (highest ranked U of Italy)<br><br>Some Univs in 152 Â¨C 200 category are:<br>Mt Sinai Med Sch (US), Durham (UK), Newcastle (UK), Southampton (UK), Queens (Canada), Wake Forest (US), Yeshiva (US), Seoul NatÂ¡Â¯l U (highest ranked U of S Korea), and Barcelona (highest ranked of Spain)<br><br>Some Univs in 201-250 group are:<br>Notre Dame (US), Reading (UK), St Andrews (UK), Cardiff (UK), Brandeis (US), Tulane (US), Western Ontario (Canada), U of Oregon (US) and Tsing Hua (No. 1 ranked Univ for PR China)<br><br>Some Univs in 251-300 group are:<br>Georgetown U (US), Lehigh (US), Lancaster (UK), Dundee (UK), UMIST (UK), Yonsei (S Korea), Keio (Japan), Indian Inst Sci (Top ranked U for India), Peking U (PR China)<br><br>Some Univs in 301-350 category are:<br>Warwick (UK), York (UK), Waseda (Japan), Queen Mary College London (UK), Macquarie (Aust), Fudan and Nanjing (PR China)<br><br>Some Univ in 350-400 category are:<br>Bath (UK), Massey (NZ), Newcastle (Aust), Otago (NZ)<br><br>Some Univ in 401-450 category are:<br>La Trobe (Aust), Exeter (UK), Surrey (UK)<br><br>Some Univ in 450-500 category are:<br>London Sch Economics (UK), Loughborough (UK), Keele (UK), Indian Inst Tech Delhi,<br><br>SINGAPORE:<br>Singapore NUS is ranked in 102-151 group, NTU is in 351-400 group.<br><br>HONG KONG:<br>Unlike AsiaweekÂ¡Â¯s ranking which give HKÂ¡Â¯s Univs very high rank, SHJT UÂ¡Â¯s World Ranking did not rate Hong KongÂ¡Â¯s Univs very highly.  <strong>Univ of Hong Kong (that was given No. 3 in AsiaWeekÂ¡Â¯s 2000 ranking and said to be Â¡Â®world class i.e. Top 10 in Asia-PacificÂ¡Â¯) was only ranked 251-300 category together with Hong Kong Univ Sci &amp; Tech (ranked 7 in Asia-Pac by AsiaWeek).</strong>  Chinese Univ of Hong Kong (that was ranked 6 in AsiaWeekÂ¡Â¯s 2000 ranking) is only given a 301-350 ranking together with City U of Hong Kong (ranked 27 by AsiaWeek).<br><br>TAIWAN:<br>The same happens for Taiwan Univs, many were ranked in top 20 in Asia-Pacific by Asiaweek in 2000 but where not very impressive in this ranking.  Only Natl Taiwan Univ was in 152-200 (ranked 12 by Asiaweek), Natl Cheng kung U is in 351-400 Natl Tsing Hua U in 401-450, Natl Sun Yat Sen in 451-500 (all 3 were ranked top 20 by Asiaweek)<br><br>From HK and Taiwan result, it is clear that when compared to Japan and Australia Univs rank closed to HK/Taiwan Univs in AsiaweekÂ¡Â¯s rank of Asia-Pac Univs, <strong>AsiaWeekÂ¡Â¯s ranking criteria specially boost HK and Taiwan Univs to be ranked artificially high and it became obvious when ranked by SHJT Univ Â¨C Many top Japan and Australia Univs still remain within Top 200 but not Most Top HK and Taiwan Univs.</strong><br><br>ONLY SURPRISE:<br>Overall, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only surprise and extra-ordinary is LSE, really dunno why it was ranked relatively low in 451-500 group</span>.<br><br>Website is at <strong>http://ed.sjtu.edu.cn/ranking.htm</strong><br><br></div>
