How could it be fair!<br><br>[b]30 Asian companies </strong>are also included in the Â¡Â®reputationÂ¡Â¯ assessment, this<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> definitely is biased because it does not include any Pacific companies and therefore biased against Aussie/NZ univs.   I am there4 not surprised that Pacific Univ arenÂ¡Â¯t rank high.  </span><br><br>Secondly, Asiaweek did not say which 30 coysÂ¡Â¯, <strong>it could be all from East Asia!
