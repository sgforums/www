The region, which has more than half the world's population, was too large and diffuse, they said - and it just isn't the Asian way for national institutions to be compared in such an explicit fashion.<br><br>Three years on, it would seem the critics might have been right. The latest survey of the "best" universities in Asia, published in the June 30 issue of the Hong Kong-based magazine, is almost as notable for its missing institutions - in some cases entire countries and territories - as for its top place-getters.<br><br>Japan's Kyoto and Tohoku Universities again took the first and second spots among the 77 "multidisciplinary" institutions surveyed, although in reverse order from last year. Other institutions in that leading group were in Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore. Among 39 science-and-technology institutions, which the magazine rates separately, South Korea's elite Advanced Institute of Science and Technology retained its top ranking. Faring considerably less well than in previous surveys, at least among participating institutions from the 14 countries surveyed, were national universities in Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines, where the magazine found that only about a quarter of each institution's full-time teachers and researchers have PhDs. With the exception of the University of Auckland, the country's largest, New Zealand's universities continued to rate poorly, in some cases worse than countries receiving foreign aid from the New Zealand government.<br><br>As with similar surveys published by the Financial Times, US News and World Report and Macleans magazine in Canada, Asiaweek's immodest aim is to measure the academic excellence of institutions by quantifying their achievements. Or, as Cesar Bacani, the survey's editor, explained in a recent interview at his Hong Kong office, "objectifying the myths".<br><br>"In Asia, unfortunately, it's often been the way that a university will claim to be the best university in a country or in all of Asia, and its basis for saying that is because they say that always been the case. Nothing else! You just have to take their word for it. But we feel that could be shortchanging the consumers." Working with four assistants and the magazine's correspondents, Bacani now spends much of each year concentrating on the survey, along with another separate survey, published in May, of top MBA schools.<br><br>Results are based on a number of familiar categories: academic reputation; selection criteria; faculty resources; research output; financial ratio of students to academic staff members; graduate students; citations in international journals; and Internet bandwidth.<br><br>Tokyo's president, Hasumi Shigehiko, has said that education and research at his institution "cannot be compared with that of other universities . . . Such characteristics are profoundly individual and extremely difficult to quantify."<br><br>With only two exceptions, Taiwanese universities pulled out en masse, leaving the me magazine to take the unusual step of ranking the island's higher education on the basis of information supplied to it in previous surveys. In a letter on behalf of Taiwan's Association of National Universities and Colleges, Wei- Jao Chen said that while the rankings "are truly a valuable and trustworthy research done with profound investigation and solid critical analysis", local academics and universities shared the "general conviction that we are entitled to develop individually and autonomously according to our different historical backgrounds".<br><br>Citing similar reservations - while remaining leery of being judged alongside "national" institutions in Taiwan - most top mainland Chinese institutions opted out of the latest survey. Also joining the holdouts were some major Pakistani universities, as well as institutions in Thailand, India, Macau and half those in New Zealand. Ian Smith, a deputy vice-chancellor at New Zealand's University of Otago (No 41), one of the four local institutions that did participate, has since called the data on which Asiaweek based its survey "simply unbelievable", "crazy" and "frankly bizarre". (The magazine intends to publish the full data on its website later in July.)<br><br>Smith's institution, and two of the others participating from New Zealand, have said it will reevaluate its commitment to the next survey. Even universities which have consistently fared well in the survey, such as those in Singapore, have criticised the methodology and the way universities are shown abruptly falling or rising, as if they were pop singles.<br><br>Although not visibly concerned about possible rejection by the antipodeans, Bacani is disappointed at the snubs from universities closer to home, particularly in Japan. "We do not present ourselves as experts, but we do present ourselves as consumers who, like anybody else, want and demand to know the quality of a very important product. If there were another body, an expert body, doing this for consumers in Asia then Asiaweek wouldn't be doing it. But there is no other body. Not one. It's sad."<br><br>-Dawn/The Guardian News Service<br><br></div>
