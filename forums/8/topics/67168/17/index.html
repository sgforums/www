It seems that youÂ’re too busy hailing little Robbie as the second coming to pay attention Â– little wonder, then, that you bollixed your AÂ’s.<br><br>By the way, thereÂ’s a big difference between being egomaniacal (thereÂ’s no hyphen, by the way, just to help you with your ignorance), and tripping over your itty-bitty little ego.

Why do an about-face now?  You show a distinct lack of education, the way you have missed the point entirely.  Maybe you should go back to school and do it all over again, and do try not to screw it up this time.  ItÂ’s sad how your claim of being educated in fact shows your lack of appreciation of the term Â“educatedÂ”.  Do try to sort that out Â– rural sophisticates are a dime a dozen, and itÂ’s making you look cheap.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by cookiecutter:</div><div class="quote_body">Chenglton: You have brought up those ridiculous statistics before.

If you noticed, i said "entry requirements AND SO ON.."</div></blockquote>What chengleton has posted is not from the guide, but in fact was the actual cutoff score - it is therefore fact and not opinion.  What does it take for you to understand something as simple as the distinction between fact and opinion?  Methinks your adoration for little Robbie blinds you to the obvious.  By the way, little Robbie, shame on you for sending out an intellectually defenceless little girl to do you fighting for you.  For shame.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by cookiecutter:</div><div class="quote_body">( yes, i am bringing it up again, no need to reply to this since i already know you are going to insist that all unis are born equal blah blah)</div></blockquote>This only serves to clearly demonstrate your defensiveness.

Which institution is more selective?</div></blockquote>You've got a lot of cheek asking this one - you didn't even recognise entry requirements when chengleton put them in front of you.  If you can't even recognise entry requirements, you don't have a foundation to build your misguided opinions on.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by cookiecutter:</div><div class="quote_body">As they say in the military.."wake up your ideas!"<br>[/url]</div></blockquote>Oh my, my, my Â– you do have a penchant for nattering about subjects you have no knowledge of, donÂ’t you?  They also say in the military: "opinions are like assholes - everybody's got one".  Neither yours nor Rob's counts more than anybody else's, so you're going to have to come up with some real evidence to back up your outlandish claims.  Then again, you can't even distinguish fact from opinion, so I'm not holding my breath.<br><br>Now run along and play Â– I hear thereÂ’s a new Barbie collection coming out soon, and that ought to keep you out of trouble for a while.<br></div>

As such, you miss the point about Heller and try to make yourself feel better about your ignorance by sweeping it under the carpet as nitty gritty.<br><br>Henry David Thoreau spoke of simplicity.  You've misnterpreted it and made simplemindedness your philosophy.  When he wrote of keeping one's affairs on a thumbnail, he didn't mean for you to throw the baby out with the bathwater by overlooking the relevance of details, you literalist.<br><br><blockquote>lets clear something up, i didnt "bollix my As", because they only come out next week. </blockquote>Well, in the post where you said you were from SRJC, you did write that you didn't do well for your A's, didn't you?  Perhaps some of the other posters saw that before you edited it out - I certainly did.  Did you mean your O's then?  For crying out loud, if you can't get simple things like this right, do you really think that what you say is worth a plugged nickel (get used to that - I think a lot of people will be telling you that stateside)?<br><br><blockquote>And you came from a poly right?</blockquote>Wrong - JC.  You're the one assuming.<br><br><blockquote>My questions at the end of the last post were in reference to US uni rankings. Or did you fail english comprehension?</blockquote>Oh I'm sorry - are you under the illusion that only US universities have entrance requirements?  As you say, wake up your ideas!  I was pointing out that while you mentioned entrance requirements, you blithely ignored chengleton's post with the entrance requirements of some of RMIT's courses.  It looks like you're the one in need of English (capital E, by the way - or did you miss that in school too?) comprehension lessons.<br><br><blockquote>but i outgrew her some time ago</blockquote>Not the way you construct your so-called arguments and use weak sources as corroborating evidence.<br><br><blockquote>Let me just say this, I could easily get into your little sandstone university. </blockquote>And your point is?  Like I already agreed with you in my last post, nobody gives a good goddam except little Robbie.  I sure as hell don't care much about the sandstone status - I went for what the course could offer, and the brand name is of no relevance.<br><br>Awww, aren't you so sweet now, defending the little underdog?  Well, tell you what - you just watch the pounding continue because your God still hasn't put his money where his mouth is.  you know what the irony is?  Up till yesterday, I was losing interest in this thread - now the heat's just been turned back up, and little Robbie has you to thank for it.  Ah well, the road to hell is, after all, paved with good intentions.<br><br>In the meantime, don't expect any breaks.  You sure as hell aren't a lady, and you're not going to have that lame excuse to hide behind.  You want to play with fire, bring the asbestos underwear along.</div>

Its not your business to tell who what not to read, what not to post or even what is rubbish. This kind of attitude reflects what I said about you, making sweeping statements. Same thing with Rob Chen. He did wrote explicitly that our opinions doesnt count. Humans are not clones mind you.<br><br>Its control freak like you who do well in government, mind you, onli Singapore government.<br><br>Besides, you did make remarks like this<br><br>'Look, I know that all of you are good friends and know each other to a certain extent due to the forum. but its pretty obvious that this thread has alot of biased opinions.

This is so great, just found out Gendaken was/is a commando and that Heng was this girl from RJC (hmm)<br><br>do you even know what a sweeping statement is? Its something like- George Bush is actually Osama Bin Laden in disguise. I doubt i made many (if any) such comments.<br><br>Anyway, you are reading too deep between the lines. I never said anything about collusion. but if there is some form of tacit collusion going on, then so be it. Whats the problem? you are not the one getting all the arrows directed towards you.<br><br>*sigh* I am not a like-minded sheep. I have my opinions, and all i said was that there were rubbish topics on the forum. I never said not to read them! Anyway, if you guys wanna read abt porn or what not thats not my business, i was just using it as an example to illustrate my point. Do not misrepresent or twist what i say, thats all i ask.</div>
