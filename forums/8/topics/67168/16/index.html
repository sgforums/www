So if they already have problems with their own rankings, in trying to make sure its fair, why the crap would they want to put their faith in the 500 nonsense?<br><br>3) If you still cannot accept that there are 3rd rate universities and first rate universities, then continue deluding yourself and live in lala land. Australia has the G8 universities. The US has the Top 50. The UK has the Top 50 or so as well.<br><br>4) Generally as a rule of thumb, good universities do not need to advertise because they do not need to. If you went to one that did, good for you.<br><br>5) As to the person who said that poly holders w deg are valued more than JC holder w a NUS deg....your ignorance astounds me.<br>How many JC students are there? arent they the top 25%? Don't the best of that 25% ( and top 10% of poly grads) go to NUS?<br>Please ok, there are plenty of poly students who go to aussie and the UK (but less) because they cannot make it into a local uni.<br><br>NUS/NTU students are the elite of singapore. And those who go to the top universities in the states and the UK. Show me anyone who is a top civil servant ie. top govt post who went to lousy schs like RMIT and such.

Its not surprising that she clings on to the "If you're not from JC/top uni you're nothing" drivel.<br><br>You try to tell her its not like that out of this well called Singapore or in the real world, but its obvious she doesn't want to listen, so let her find out the hard way loh.<br><br>FYI I'm from one of those "3rd rate" universities that Robbie mentioned, but in a course offered only by 2 universities in Australia. The other U that offered the course was supposedly better in overall rankings, but their course I was interested in had a very narrow focus, so I chose my uni. Much to my surprise, I had classmates who took their foundation in the other better uni, then switched over to my uni because of the same reason.<br><br>Apparently I was not alone in focusing on the course, rather that sweeping generalized rankings.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>cooks, your description of your attitude towards working in univeristy is good, and good on you for that.  Also, yes, there are students who go overseas and slack off.  However, the other posters here object to being tarred with the same brush through these sweeping statements about third-rate unis.  Can you see how you're attracting fire from them?<br><br>Look, have a read of the first few pages of this thread, and I think you might then develop an appreciation of the people whith whom you're conversing now, what points have already been covered and the current state of affairs on this thread.<br><br>I don't know if it's anything to do with your age and experience, and I'm not going to go there, but certainly your arguments could use some development.  A case in point is in the articles you cited when I first challenged you to produce evidence.  In my response, I have shown why those articles fail to hold water once you get past prima facie.<br><br>At the moment you're drawing fire from other posters on account of some of the generalised statements you've made here.  The best way to prevent that is to deal with examples on an individual level.</div>

And to repeat what I've said in earlier posts, I can't get into NTU/NUS so I went overseas.<br><br>So the bottomline is that please don't anyhow say other people's uni not good loh, coz' will make people like me feel like an idiot for choosing to study there and even more so for those who work so hard to save up the $$ for an education abroad and more importantly, a 2nd chance for university education.<br><br>And regarding all the university guides out there, all I can say is that they are useful only to give you an understanding rather than based your choice of programs entirely on them.

            <div class='col-md body'>Gendaken, I took your advice and read the first few pages of posts much more carefully.<br><br>All I can say is that i believe that Rob is being treated unfairly, and that his opinion holds elements of truth in it, with regard to third rate universities. He backed up alot of what he said with research and analysis, which i believe is more than any of you did.<br>Instead, he came under scathing personal attacks, to which he duly responded to.<br><br>Heng: You seem to be following in Gendakens footsteps in wanting to know my uni. What, so i will "walk the walk, talk the talk". Oyu are so full of contradictory crap, first calling me a snob and elitist when you yourself lorded your credentials and what not in the earlier posts.<br><br>So what if one has a doctorate? you would think that some one who has a distinguished Phd would act much more responsibly and maturely. The people on this thread are reguars, with most coming from what were branded "3rd rate universities", and one from uni of hawaii ( which is no great university mind you esp with all the scathing things you said to rob)<br><br>Thus, it is understandable that you would stoutly defend it. However, it is myopic and frankly pretty stupid not to admit that there are different pedigrees of universities and that there are disparities in the standards of teaching. Everywhere in the world.<br><br>The US, UK, Australia, Canada etc all have their fair share of shitty universities. The better universities have more difficult entry requirements and so on. Anyway, this has all been covered before so i will not go on. To end off, let me say that i am sure "3rd rate" unis produce outstanding students and grads who will excel in the working world.<br><br>But i do not think that any of you are one of them. Intellectual discussion and debate has been degraded into personal attacks and taunts on character. People try to show their superiority by wanting to meet up and compare certs. This behaviour is unbecoming of adults who have graduated and claim to be educated in a quality institution.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh cooks, how little you know.  Your ego is getting in the way of your intellect - instead of learning something, you're too busy denying being a naif.<br><br>Here's a bit of context about the mess that you have so blithely traipsed into.  This is not the first time little Robbie has started such a thread, but some of us here are fairly determined to ensure it will be the last, because we've had a gutful of his pompous and childish ways.<br><br>If you think his arguments are reasonable, so be it - nobody is responsible for getting you past your surface-level thinking (as I have pointed out with your poor understanding of statistics, and your tendency to take a personal perspective as Holy Writ) to lead you to enlightenment.<br><br>I am entirely prepared to engage in proper debate, so long as my opponent returns the courtesy - some of my posts in other threads will demonstrate this.<br><br>In this case, however, little Robbie tried to write off other's arguments by saying that they don't count in his opinion.  Well and good - we asked for his qualifications to see what makes his opinion so great that it can be used to override anyone's argument without need for counterargument in itself.  Being a Heller fan, I've got absolutely no problem whatsoever parodying little Robbie's childishness and taking it to the extreme.<br><br>You also keep ignoring the fact that not only am I from a sandstone university, I also hold the doctorate.  Why should I debate against a point that serves only to boost my self-esteem?  The fact of the matter is that little Robbie is wrong, and I am taking up an argument against my own interests in the interest of objectivity.<br><br>Look at the TER scores that chengleton posted - do those look like third-rate entery requirements to you?  By the way, you've already demonstrated your lack of knowledge of the subject matter, so I'll have to explain to you that the TER score is out of a maximum of 100.<br><br>I think it's ultimate testimony to your naivete that you should make comments about our immaturity - we're being deliberately so and you've just demonstrated how you've completely missed the point.  Sadly, you've just demonstrated third-rate thinking.</div>
