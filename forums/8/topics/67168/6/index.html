            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Rob,<br><br>Nobody will appreciate you for calling their unis as 3rd rate or 4th rate at your own point of view. Whats the point of putting other people down especially when you said that you aint from any of those BS unis which u claim them to be? Even though in your own point of view you hate them to the core or some RMIT student stuffed a metal rod up ur ass...putting others down in such a manner will not show your superiority and will only demure personal character...Also, you are degrading yourself here when you mentioned that rankings and reviews on unis by asiaweek and good unis guide are a load of crap when they are two well-known and respected sources...Go try writing a 'Rob Chen's Guidebook' or create a webby on your crap...and maybe you can be the next pauline hanson or even william hung..</div>

(of course besides the guarantee to graduate  Â¡Â®policyÂ¡Â¯ )  </strong></span><br><br>Many UK 3rd rate Univs <span style="color: blue;">allow in people without even 2 A levels, which is<strong> in fact against admission policy for ALL Univs in UK</strong></span><strong>!   </strong><br><br>They also did that and recently a newspaper article reported that <span style="color: red;"><strong>1 in 12 HOMELESS in BRITAIN (NOT JOBLESS!) are from those newbie UK Univs that conferred degrees like selling toilet papers!  </strong></span>Of course,<span style="color: blue;"> those were all polys until converted into Univs in the 1980s.  </span><br><br>For my own experience, I<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> once asked the admission requirement of a 3rd rate Aussie univ for my friend at a edu fair. </span>  The rep from that 3rd rate newbie uni claimed that the results I told them (my friendÂ¡Â¯s result) <span style="color: red;">have NO HOPE OF entering their Univ Â¨C and told me their Â¡Â®CUT OFFÂ¡Â¯ for that particular course.</span><br><br>However,<span style="color: blue;"> <strong>my friend APPLIED anyway and they still let him enroll.
