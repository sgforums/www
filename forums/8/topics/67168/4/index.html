For example, RMIT got a score of 51.94, which will place it 55th in the multi-discpilinary UNIs list, which means it out-ranked schools such as Maquarie, La trobe, Deakin and others.<br><br>Asiaweek's rankings criteria is much more comprehensive as it takes into account academic reputation, student selectivity, financial resources, students per academic staff, graduate students, resources and citations in international journals, whereas in the SHJT rankings, 80% of the UNI's score is depended on research or citations (check the ranking methodology page of the SHJT site).<br><br>And please don't tell me ever again that universities like RMIT have low cut-offs.

Exactly which uni you are from has all importance here.  if you are going to be sitting in an ivory tower trying to pass judgement on universities, you had better at least establish some bona fides.<br><br>From the way you write, I would be very surprised if you did indeed have an honours degree.  Remember, I do have experience teaching Honours students (including producing a few First Class Honours students at sandstones), not just being one myself.  Also, my doctorate is from a sandstone, and my wider and more extensive experience puts me in a better position to assess the subject matter at hand than you.  From what I have seen, the other posters' arguments hold water better than yours, and I have to say that you seem sadly misguided and tightly gripped in a brand-name mentality.  Ironically, you don't want to reveal your own brand name.<br><br>It appears that you are making up a lot of things, and most of what you say is baseless.  So, if I'm wrong, please prove me so.  Otherwise, I think we can take you to be nothing more than a BS artist.</div>

What I've written is clear enough for anyone with the half-ounce of brains you lack.  First, I made the distinction between undergrad and postgrad already, and explained how universities differ in the priorities that place on either - you factor that into your selection of universities.  Second, I have already described how the emphasis on postgrad but not undergrad has produced undergrads with somewhat less than stellar performance - those students were wasted on such a system.  And third, you ignorant little turd, Melbourne offered a doctorate in Organisational Psychology that Swinburne did not.  The only other university offering a similar course was Monash, and the program was only in its first year, with a lot of bugs to be ironed out.  That's normal for new courses, but you wouldn't know that would you?<br><br>Rob, you're nothing but a little fish in a shallow bowl, and identifying brand names is as much as you understand anything in your little surface-level world.
