How could it be fair!<br><br><strong>30 Asian companies </strong>are also included in the Â¡Â®reputationÂ¡Â¯ assessment, this<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> definitely is biased because it does not include any Pacific companies and therefore biased against Aussie/NZ univs.   I am there4 not surprised that Pacific Univ arenÂ¡Â¯t rank high.  </span><br><br>Secondly, Asiaweek did not say which 30 coysÂ¡Â¯, <strong>it could be all from East Asia! Especially Taiwan and HK where AsiaweekÂ¡Â¯s circulation is the largest.   </strong>Those 30 coys<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> could all be small and medium enterprises and NOT BIG / established ones with big and experienced HR department enough to make sensible assessments!  </span><br><br>Thus <span style="color: darkblue;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">any 'reputation' assessment is biased towards East Asian Univs and is also unreliable.  </span></span><br><br><strong><span style="color: brown;">I am NOT surprised why many Taiwan and HK univs ranked SO HIGH in AsiaWeek in Top 10 and called world class but were surprisingly OUTSIDE World Top 300 in the ShangHai Jiao Tong ranking.</span></strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>even though SHJT is predominately research based -  <span style="color: red;">Top 10 in Asia-Pac should be at least top 200 in the World in whatever criteria wat! </span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This only shows the weakness of Asiaweek ranking</span>. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Now on Univs ranking other Univs within Asia and Pacific.<br><br>Most East Asian unis interact mostly with SE Asian Univs or Pacific Univs and have Â¡Â®not heardÂ¡Â¯ (donÂ¡Â¯t know much about/ don't interact much with) of South Asian Univs.   Most Aussie / NZ unis also donÂ¡Â¯t know SE Asian Unis well, NOT to mention South Asians ones.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">And worse still, WHEN they (Asian or Pacific Univs) donÂ¡Â¯t know much about Univs from other regions and asked to rank, [/u<strong>]<span style="color: red;">they will just anyhow pick a univ which have heard B4 from the newspaper ADVERTISEMENTs, TV advs, Educational Fairs i.e. like RMIT and Curtin that advertised a great deal in SE and East Asia!   </span></strong><br><br>That explains <strong>why RMIT and Curtin score relatively higher compared to SO MANY OTHER AUSSIE techno Univs </strong>---<span style="color: blue;"> only because the other 15-20 Technological Unis from Australia LOST OUT to RMIT and Curtin in Advertising / publicity CAMPAIGNs in Asia!</span><br>[u]Btw, many Techno Univ other than RMIT and Curtin were not even included, doesnÂ¡Â¯t it look suspicious? Those doing the ranking obviously already Â¡Â®pre-selectÂ¡Â¯ which Techno Univs they wanted to include in the 1st round of Â¡Â®considerationÂ¡Â¯ and then forced others to rank later!  </span><br>This definitely explains <span style="color: darkred;">why South Asian Univs are ranks so super Low in AsiaweekÂ¡Â¯s ranking</span>.<br><br>Luckily <span style="color: blue;">they only included the Â¡Â®Far EastÂ¡Â¯ donÂ¡Â¯t also bring in West Asian ones from the Â¡Â®Middle EastÂ¡Â¯,</span><br>otherwise I guarantee everyone,<strong> those Arabian / Iranian Universities will definitely rank the lowest and who know what can happen next Â¡Â­ a East or SE Asian (Â¡Â®Far EasternÂ¡Â¯) Uni ka-na bombed suddenly!</strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

I AM superior to you, litle Honours boy, and I have the paperwork to prove it.  The paper's all you're about, isn't it?  Suck it up then.<br><br>You know, there's just one thing you're right about - on this forum alone, there is no such thing as proof, and I figure you're hiding behind that.  Tell you what, dickweed - I reckon there's only one way to settle this.  I'll bring my papers and my I/C and you bring yours, and anybody who wants to come to your ass-whupping is welcome.  If you want to talk the talk, you'd better be prepared to walk the walk.  Even if (and that's a big if) you're telling the truth, I still outrank you by being in the top 1% of Honours graduates internationally.  I'm here, I've got the proof and I'm ready to go - what about you?<br><br>The way I see it, if you do turn up, you're in for the humiliation of your life.  If you don't, you'll be forever branded as a bare-faced liar, and a coward to boot.  Your choice.<br><br>Oh, by the way, ergomonics is one of my areas of specialty, and engineers and rocket scientists ask us for guidance in instrumentation and control guidance - Klein and Associates is one of the biggest players in that area, and the US Air Force depend on them regularly; check out the J-STARS program, for instance.  Economists' statistics are also more basic than what I do.  Again, you have shown your utter and complete ignorance, casting more doubt on the veracity of your far-fetched claims of being an Honours graduate.<br><br>So why don't you put your money where your mouth is?
