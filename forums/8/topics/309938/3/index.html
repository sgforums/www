              <p>Religion and Science exist for different purposes but yet explain the unexplained.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Religion is something that has existed for centuries. It all started out when people in the past question about "what happen when a man dies". So being the wisest in the town, the "wise" man tried to explain the unexplained. And along with the years, parents pass it on to childrens. This has become a root in many people and this is where one's moral come about. Although it can never be proven whether or not god existed, everyone must agree that - without religion, we will be living in a chaotic world where moral does not exist at all.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Science on the otherhand, are for the brave who ventures out to the unknown. Personally, I believe in darwin's theory and about the fittest survives. Cell mutates and its pretty obvious if you notice the people around you. Evolution does happen around you. Science can be used to explain many things but in the end, its a question of whether you believe in your religion or science.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Actually, talking about religion and science is a very troublesome topic. Religious people will question science and vice versa. And in worst case scenarios, the religous people will get offended because of the lack of evidence to prove their claims.. Oh well..</p>

              <p>I do not agree with tis point though. Without religion, people still have morals and know how to live in society. Tis can even be explained from an evolution principle. People live in groups. People who live better in group survive better. They will develop traits tat allow them to live better in groups. And these traits r simply morals, or how to live in society and group</p>

              <p>Let me see... Have you watched 10,000BC? In the past, people are
              already living in groups. From groups to villages and finally to
              cities. In those ancient "groups", they have their religion too. And
              its that very religion that allows them to have their morals to not
              kill each other in the same group. As they shares the same belief AKA
              religion.</p>

              <p>This boils down to a very old question whether moral code exists first or religion exists first. If u ask me, moral code exists first before a form of religion. This is because if they have no moral, they cannot live in a group in the first place and even if some guy have some facinating idea of a religion, he cannot spread it to his people. In fact, religion comes about only when a group live for a long period of time, so long tat it probably reaches hundreds of years to develop <strong>communication and language</strong> effectively then can a religion start off.</p>

              <p><br>Without religion, there is no moral is such a sweeping statement. There are many atheist today in the world who still live happily and uphold morality. Religion is just an aspect of one's life. I also realize nowadays that many of those into religions are not upholding morality at all. Especially teenagers who claim they go to church and all these whom i noe. they are still as selfish and inconsiderate as they were. I dont want to quarrell or whatever here, but just wanna say there are many paths in life, not just one. The path is each and everyone's choice, and if everyone follow the same path, there is chaos too.</p>
              <p>But of course, religion is still important. Some people needs religion to guide their lives. Its up to the indivisual to decide. However, many wars has sparked off due to religion. There are killings, slanderings and all kinds of evil you can think of when war starts. If religions uphold morality and make people do good things, why is there intolerance and discrimination that is not even considered moral.</p>
