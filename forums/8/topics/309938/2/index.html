              <p><br>Humans did not live together with dinosaurs because the "terrible lizards" went extinct at 65.5 MYA (million years ago) before the time period of 10,000BCE and even before the appearance of <em>Homo sapiens</em>. Succinct and clear info on the timeline of Earth and its organisms can be found here:  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_evolution">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_evolution</a></p>
              <p>Or you can refer to the various literature in biology, anthropology or even geography.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The biblical Genesis account contains moral/spiritual lessons ut is nevertheless mythology, and should not to be taken literally (although many fundamentalists do so). And indeed Genesis is not taken literally by many in mainstream Christian circles (refer to:   <a href="http://www.butler.edu/clergyproject/religion_science_collaboration.htm">http://www.butler.edu/clergyproject/religion_science_collaboration.htm</a>).</p>
              <p>Only crackpot creationists and kooky pseudoscientists cling stubbornly to their mistaken beliefs in a literal interpretation of Genesis. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is no conflict between religion and science, so as long as religious believers behave rationally and do not ignore scientific and research evidence - accumulated &amp; peer-reviewed for the past 200 yrs of moden science.  </p>

              <p>Evolution is both a theory and a fact. When scientists use the word "theory", they do not mean "guess"- it means a body of knowledge based upon sound evidence.  </p>

              <p>From Scientific American at: <a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000D4FEC-7D5B-1D07-8E49809EC588EEDF">http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000D4FEC-7D5B-1D07-8E49809EC588EEDF</a></p>

              <p>Many people learned in elementary school that a theory falls in the middle of a hierarchy of certainty--above a mere hypothesis but below a law. Scientists do not use the terms that way, however.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>According to the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), a scientific theory is "a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world that can incorporate facts, laws, inferences, and tested hypotheses." No amount of validation changes a theory into a law, which is a descriptive generalization about nature.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So when scientists talk about the theory of evolution--or the atomic theory or the theory of relativity, for that matter--they are not expressing reservations about its truth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In addition to the <em>theory</em> of evolution, meaning the idea of descent with modification, one may also speak of the <em>fact</em> of evolution. The NAS defines a fact as "an observation that has been repeatedly confirmed and for all practical purposes is accepted as 'true.'" The fossil record and abundant other evidence testify that organisms have evolved through time. Although no one observed those transformations, the indirect evidence is clear, unambiguous and compelling.</p>
              <p>All sciences frequently rely on indirect evidence. Physicists cannot see subatomic particles directly, for instance, so they verify their existence by watching for telltale tracks that the particles leave in cloud chambers. The absence of direct observation does not make physicists' conclusions less certain.</p>

              <p>There is a confidence level in the things u believe in. If u talk about sciene like evolution, then the confidence level is 99.99 % If u talk about atomic structure or gravity, they r also within tat level of confidence.
