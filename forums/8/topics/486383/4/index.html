              <p>SINGAPORE — The moderately hazy conditions that have hung over Singapore for more than a week now are set to continue tomorrow (Aug 31), with the National Environment Agency advising that the 24-hour Pollutants Standards Index (PSI) is expected to be in the moderate range (51 to 100).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There were thundery showers over parts of Singapore in the early afternoon today, and as at 7pm, the 24-hour PSI was 59 to 63. The prevailing winds tomorrow are forecast to blow from the south or southeast, and there may be occasional slight haze from Sumatra if the winds shift to blow from the south.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hot spots in Sumatra were detected throughout last week. Last Tuesday, 192 hotspots were detected. The three hour-PSI readings occaionally veered past 90 on some days, on the high end of the moderate range.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Number of hot spots in Sumatra rise to 380</span></strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE — The number of hot spots detected in Sumatra today (Sept 1) increased to 380, with the situation deteriorating for the second time in two days.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The National Environment Agency (NEA) said widespread moderate to dense smoke haze was observed in southern and central Sumatra. Yesterday, 222 hot spots were discovered in Sumatra, up from 29 the day before.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hazy conditions will linger in Singa­pore tomorrow, with the 24-hour Pollutants Standards Index (PSI) expected to be in the moderate range of 51 to 100, said the NEA.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As at 8pm yesterday, the 24-hour PSI was between 63 and 70, in the moderate range, and the three-hour PSI was 91.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The NEA said prevailing winds are forecast to blow from the south or south-east tomorrow. “There may be occasional slight haze from Sumatra if the winds shift to blow from the south,” it said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In a separate fortnightly outlook released today, the NEA said some warm days with temperatures of up to around 34°C are expected in the next two weeks, along with slightly hazy conditions, depending on wind conditions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Southwest Monsoon conditions are forecast to prevail this week and the next. Some warm days can be expected and short-duration thundery showers are likely on three to five days, mostly in the late mornings and early afternoons.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In addition, thundery showers with gusty winds due to Sumatra squalls can be expected on one or two days in the morning.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As periods of dry weather can be expected over the region, Singapore could experience slight to moderate hazy conditions on a few days, if the prevailing winds shift to blow from the south or south-west, the NEA said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Rainfall for this week and the next is expected to be below normal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Last month, below-average rainfall was also observed. The lowest level of 78mm and 102mm — which is 45 to 60 per cent below the average — was recorded in the northern part of Singapore, around Admiralty. In the second half of the month, Singapore experienced slightly hazy conditions on several days, due to the prevailing south to southwesterly winds blowing in smoke from fires in Sumatra.</p>

Wildfires caused by illegal land clearing on Indonesia's Sumatra and Borneo islands often spread choking haze into neighboring countries, and several locations in western Malaysia registered unhealthy air quality Thursday. Last year, the Indonesian Parliament ratified an agreement with other Southeast Asian countries to more actively fight forest fires and haze. The country banned open burning in 1999 after the haze caused disputes with its neighbors, but</span><span style="color: #333333; font-family: proxima-nova, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 17px;"> enforcement is often lax.</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> </span></p>

              <p>SINGAPORE: Occasional hazy conditions in Singapore are expected to continue until Sunday (Sep 6) with the 24-hour Pollutants Standard Index (PSI) fluctuating between the high end of the Moderate range (51-100) and the low end of the Unhealthy range (101-200) for the next 24 hours, authorities said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As of 6pm on Saturday, the 24-hour PSI was 85-92, in the Moderate range, and the three-hour PSI was 84.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The haze is due to to the spread of haze from Sumatra and the surrounding region under light wind conditions over Singapore, said the National Environment Agency (NEA). </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The agency said that the impact of the haze is dependent on a person's health. It advises the elderly, pregnant women, and children to minimise prolonged or strenuous outdoor physical exertion, while those with chronic lung or heart disease should avoid outdoor exertion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Those who are not feeling well should seek medical attention, said NEA.</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE: Thundery showers on Wednesday afternoon (Sep 9) brought a "slight improvement" to the air quality, said the National Environment Agency (NEA), but hazy conditions can still be expected for the rest of the day and Thursday.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The 24-hour Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) at 8pm was 69-77, which is in the Moderate range, while the 3-hour PSI at the same time was 91. On Tuesday, the 24-hour PSI neared the Unhealthy range (101 to 200).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In an advisory, NEA said that hazy conditions can still be expected on Wednesday and Thursday as prevailing winds are forecast to blow from the south and southwest. Showers are forecast for Singapore in the late morning and early afternoon on Thursday.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"The 24-hour PSI for the next 24 hours is expected to be in the high end of the Moderate range and low end of the Unhealthy range, and may further deteriorate if the winds are unfavourable," NEA added.</p>

              <p>Somebody should really listen to what we as people of singapore has to say about this haze issue at current. We really need the people to stop focusing on the general elections as soon as possible and just focus on the haze right now. I mean could anyone just attempt to make a filter system and suck the haze through this filter to clean the air of the country before it becomes too late. Even if after the elections, the haze dont stop Singapore will be faced with a even bigger crisis of having way too many people in the hospitals due to this haze issue. So at the end of it I just hope somebody will see this and share it so that someone will do their part for the haze. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Very possibly the goverment as they need to make the right desisions right now for their country. PAP hopefully, im sure that if the can help out in the haze right now they would automatically win the elections. As right now it is most important they save do what they can now instead of just focusing on the elections before this turns into any more serious of an issue as it is right now. Any  worse and it could become a major issue so i hope either the goverment or one of the high-rollers can do what they can as soon as possible.</p>

              <p>Im only 17 but if i could vote, i would vote for PAP because i feel that there isnt anything wrong with the goverment right now. I understand that SDP has made a seemingly good point about the CPF funds. However, there are many complications to letting the public know where the money goes to. Such as having to know where our cpf is invested in, people wil just keep on following the goverment to invest in the same company and therefore creating a huge financial bubble waiting to pop. Besides that, knowing the losses or profit of our CPF, what change would it bring, the only change it could actually bring is much distrust with our goverment when they make some mistakes. Everyone makes mistake, there is no guarantee profit in this world. As for WP, they focus on helping the minority groups, such as the LGBTs(no offense), but singapore being such a multi racial country, we must respect each religions beliefs and most religions has this same beliefs which is Guys are suppose to be attracted to females. besides with singapores birth rate so low if they actually promotedd LGBTs, it would make it deline much further than what it is now. Therefore i choose to support PAP, they have been governing our country well up till now. So if it is not broken there is no point to fixing it.</p>
