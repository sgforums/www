Been reading this forum for sometime, and this is the first time i register because i was thinking maybe i can get some advice from you all.<br><br>I have lent money to a so called friend of mine some 7 months back. To be exact, it's $3500. 2 months later, he had returned $500.<br><br>But since then, whenever I ask him about money, he will change topic or say he will pay later. Nowadays we seldom contact, as I'm getting fedup of him, only when I call to ask him for money.<br><br>If I'm not wrong, he does not want to pay me back the money at all! So I would like some advice from you all. $3000 is a lot of money!<br><br>Can I go to the police with such matters? Or do I seek for a lawyer to solicite my money back? Or is there no way in this type of situations where lending of money is base solely on trust? Or do I have to do it my own ways, by getting gangster friends to knock on his doors, to do what loansharks do?<br><br>I really hope for some good advices out there from you all!

            <div class='col-md body'>maybe u should have a good talk with him first, ask him whether he is in some financial difficulties...u know, pple tend to react better with soft tatics...then tell him he can pay u instalments till the money is returned....<br>if he's that kinda of person who have $$ but not willing to pay, u can use a harder strategy, that is pay his parents a visit (considering u know where he live), let the parent know....but don't threaten them, always use the soft approach...<br>if all no use, knowing u can never take the money back, blacklist him in his social life, let everyone who know him understand he is a jerk, a liar, this damage is more than the $3000 he owed, maybe then he will return the money, but u should do it in a wiser way, make sure those friends pity u then the effect will be better...<br>never resort to violence cos u are asking trouble...sue him??? not efficient and effective...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>you could try talking to him first, sometimes, it's just that he may not be able to pay you back at this moment, try to ask him when he will be able to pay you you, may you could allow him to pay you back in installments.<br><br>if he's splurging on stuff and not paying you back, then you can be quite sure you're going to take a long long time before seeing your 3 grand, but if he's truly strapped for cash and if you don't need it just yet, maybe you could try the installment payment plan, it's easier to get your money back than asking him to pay you in one lump sum.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I'll just tell you what I'll do if I were in your shoes. First, I would talk to him like what Colette said.<br><br>I'm sure you will know whether he is going to pay you or not after the talk. If he promises to pay you, make him sign some kind of IOU, saying that it's not that you don't trust him, but you want a guarantee. It is very important that you get him to do sign it. Make sure it's done by a lawyer though, because they will know how to write a proper one and that the IOU will be valid. Maybe you want to seek professional help on this matter. Better if you know someone who is a lawyer.<br><br>If he just say he will repay you and refuse to sign the IOU or he doesn't want to pay, then chances are he is not going to pay. You will have to say goodbye to your 3 grand. Take this as a lesson, though an expensive one.<br><br>Remember one thing though, make sure you know who are your friends.<br><br>One last thing, if he read this forum, then I think he will not sign.</div>

Well my friend is luckier as its only a 1000 plus......<br><br>Two of us, me and another friend tried to discourage the 'transaction' actually but failed as the lender had complete trust in the borrower....... well he was wrong in the end....... as he only managed to recover 200 or 300, that's all........ we actually scolded him for not listening and told him to take the amount as a lesson to actually see a person.......an expensive 1 i must admit.<br><br>Well all i wanna say is that in the 1st place, u lend yr money willingly, and there's not much u can do actually as u can't take things in yr own hand...... dun do anything foolish as its simply not worth it........<br><br>My advise is.....pester him, or call his house tell his family member, disgrace him, guess that's all u can do....... i know its maddening and its hard to swallow..........

If i am not wrong, you hae 6 years to collect the debt from your "friend".<br><br>So i guess if you could establish that you took out 3500 from your bank, show that this 3500 went to him AS A DEBT, and show that 3500 has not came back to you. I think you got a chance.<br><br>BUt of course, i am assuming laws in SGP allows for implicit proofs.<br><br>if you are somewhat certain i am right (which you have to find out), you can try talking to your friend that he has the legal obligation to return based on the implicit info established. Good Luck.<br><br>ANYWAY, a word to all others. A lawyer had once told my dad, "...whatever it is, he is another entity, another person, no matter how well you know him, it is better that a contract is signed, just in case..."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sen, I can really relate to ur problem cos I was once a victim too. Stupid me lent $2,000 bucks to an army friend I hardly know. Spent 2 years getting the money back.<br><br>Such domestic loans are generally not legally enforceable but are illegally enforceable. I heard got people for hire to get your money back for a commission.<br><br>The problem now is that he is avoiding the topic and you are not insistent enough. I suggest having a good talk with him, tell him directly you want to talk about this problem and coming up with a solution e.g monthly instalments of $xxx.xx and taking his Playstation II or girlfriend as a 'security'.<br><br>You: Listen, Jabroni, I want to talk about the $3000 you still owe me.<br><br>Bastard friend: Hey! Look at that chio bu behind you!!<br><br>You: Fuck you. You used that move before, I won't fall for it again.<br><br>Bastard friend: Look, I really got no money, I need to go now, my wife's having an operation.<br><br>You: Nabei, move one step and you too, will need an operation. Listen, when you were in trouble, I lent you the money like a friend, without even thinking twice, and $3,000 is not a small sum of money to me you should know that And you should know you have every responsibility to return it to me as soon as possible before I lay the Smackin' down on your candy ass.<br><br>Remember, act fast, or your worst fears will be realised.<br><br>"This is Singapore Telecom's announcement service, the number you called is not in used.........."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I oso face such problems b4, but not involving such huge sums of $$$ though. The biggest sum involved 4 my case wuz $23. Which I neber got back. The rest of the incidents are petty amounts ranging from $0.10 to $5. Yea, these incidents happen when we mix around wif frenz, lend $$$, they turn out 2 be those "borrow oredi neber return" kind...and *poof* goes our cash. If it's a huge sum, u should make a trip down personally and confront him or his family. If not, I dun see why u shld not go to the police. I mean not as in emergency 999. As in, u go Neighborhood Police Post and discuss wif them ur problem, they sure can help u one....policemen not juz handle criminal cases, they r stationed near residents 2 help in whatever they can. And if ever u get/dun get back the $$$, never have anytink 2 do wif dat person again.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello all! A big THANK YOU for those friendly advices out there, feel much better after reading them. They gave me some ideas as to what to do that sob.<br><br>Damn it! If I can't get back my money, it will be a really expensive lesson($3000)!!! But now I've learn to become one of the neow-est people you can find! Never lend money to any people! And never trust people!<br><br>Anyway what is this world coming to, a quite good friend of mine actually doing this to me, and we actually fall out over money matters! Come to think of it, I think a true friend is quite impossible to find.  Nowadays, to me, defination of friends means some idiots to be made use of. SIGH.....<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sen<br><br>Recently, I collected back a $5600 debt owed to me by a so-called "friend".  This is how I did it: I called him ceaselessly on his handphone at all times of the day and night.  I made unexpected visits to his workplace and embarrassed him in front of his colleagues, I harrassed him till he returned the money to me.  Just a word of caution though, don't overdo it. You must also have thick skin (like orange peel) in order for this method to succeed.  Good luck.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
