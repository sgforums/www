            <div class='col-md body'>Granton Marketing is not the only such company in Singapore. Other similar companies using the 5 and 8, impulse and JUICE include:<br><br>1) Vision Marketing International<br>2) Prime Vision International<br>3) Times Vision Marketing<br>4) Tramax<br>5) Sun Vision International<br><br>It's definitely not MLM, but the environment is irksome. Not a good job recommendation unless you want to be "enculted" into the system. The pay is high but the mental stress and tricks are high. Visit http://wolfram.org/scam/ds_max/ for details on how these companies work, tick and trick.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i was with prime vision intl for 3 days.<br>i was looking for a temp job that time.<br>it was a sales promoter job. i had to sell stuff outdoors.<br><br>initially, i had to sell watches for them. i didn't feel morally wrong selling them, even if it was on impulse that people bought them. nobody was forced to buy anything. the watches were indeed cheap. what you pay is what you get. so no problems.<br><br>then on the third day, the company told me they were going to do a promotional gimmick for a perfume which was to be launched in the coming month in Seiyu. They were going to sell the perfume for $15 during this promotion, so people had to buy them during this time, otherwise it would cost them more a month later. the manager also said this period of time was also when they could test the market because if at $15, the sales weren't good, they wouldn't bother lauching the perfume.<br><br>that's when it started to irk me. i knew it was a lie. you don't have to come up with stories like that.<br><br>it's okay to even sell a defected product, as long as it's made know to the buyer. if you try to hide facts and lie, then it's wrong. i walked away immediately.<br><br>they also have tactics trying to make you stick on with the company.<br>they told me a lot about the career advancement within the company which i was totally uninterested because i was only temp.<br>of course, there were also lots of rags to riches stories. a lot of jc orientation crap too.<br><br>most people working there are teens, but there were also undergrads who actually quit school to do this. how dumb can that be?<br><br>still a good learning experience. i've never bought anything on impulse since.<br><br></div>
