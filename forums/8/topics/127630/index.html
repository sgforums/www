            <div class='col-md body'>Stiff at 21???  Wait till you reach my age....hahaha.  At 21, there should only be one stiff part of your body (I assume you're a guy).  If you're a girl, then at 21, there should be two stiff parts on your body. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Seriously, there are many people above 21 who are into martial arts.  In fact, some world boxing champions fight till 48 years old (and boxing is also very stressful for the body).<br><br>Hey, there are many karate gyms in Singapore.  Try doing a google search on "karate, Singapore" and a whole list comes up.  There are also some at CCs, etc.  We can't really recommend because we don't know where you live, how you came to the decision to learn karate, what your purpose is, etc.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe that flexibility is a matter of stretching. I started Wushu training at 16 for about 3 months.. Due to O levels then, I stopped, but picked it up recently again (I'm 19 now). From 16 till now, I haven't stretched much at all, so the Wushu training was abit tough at first. But stretching slowly then progressing bit by bit got me better.<br><br>Although Wushu and Karate are two different martial arts, I believe the basics are pretty much the same.. I'm currently working towards the split, hope to do it within 3 months!<br><br>Check out this website for stretching tips: <a href="http://www.dur.ac.uk/dubc.freshmen/navigation/technical/Full%20stretching.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dur.ac.uk/dubc.freshmen/navigation/technical/Full%20stretching.html</a><br><br>Don't give up because of your age ok? Give it 3 months and you'll be on your way to becoming a Karate master!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>HIYAAAAAAA *CHOP! CHOP!* <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Hi again firered,<br><br>Seriously I don't know what your worry is because there are loads of people above 21 taking martial arts.....21 is actually quite a young (and good) age to get serious on martial arts.  And not everyone in martial arts is as fit as you think.....I've seen so many times people talking like heroes, but start panting like hell just after 10 lousy kicks.<br><br>BJJ is Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, a modification of traditional Japanese Jiu Jitsu (a.ka. traditional Judo) by a Brazilian called Gracie (he's over 70 now and still active in the art).  Its mainly ground fighting - very technical sort of wrestling.  BJJ doesn't depend on grabbing of the Japanese gi, so its more effective for streetfighting situations (although scraping your back on the ground will hurt - ouch!).<br><br>Since you have karate fetish <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> , then karate is a fine art to start with (and cheap too - for someone in NS like yourself).  You can change later, after a year or so, to other arts.  Very often its the person which matters, not the art.<br><br>Try joining classes with adults....(many classes are filled with kids only).<br><br>Marine Parade CC has a seeminly good karate class, although I can't find their website anymore.  Trying checking with the CC for details.<br><br>If you're willing to travel a bit, the Shitoryu Karate Association at McNair Road (opposite Ceylon Club) is another very good place to learn and train. Lots of adult members, locals and foreigners.  Link is here: <a href="http://ska.org.sg/" rel="nofollow">http://ska.org.sg/</a><br><br>Lastly, you may want to know that everything in this posting was written by someone who has never practiced karate before. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

(I think Krav Mega is Hebrew meaning "touching art" or something like that).<br><br>There are a few places which teach BJJ in Singapore, but they're not all that cheap.<br><br>- SBGi (Straight Blast Gym at Lavender area).  $50-100 per month, twice a week.  The instructor is Kon - this thread has his contact details:  <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=125405" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=125405</a><br><br>- SBGi (Straight Blast Gym operates out of BXG Fitness now). <a href="http://www.bxgfitness.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bxgfitness.com</a>.  S$30 per session.<br><br>- Darren's gym, I don't know the name of the gym.
