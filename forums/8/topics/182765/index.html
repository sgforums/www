            <div class='col-md body'>Real story...Many years ago, I went to visit a friend in Tanjong Pagar during Midday. She was few weeks pregnant. I knocked the door and heard children giggling inside the flat but nobody open the door. I asked them to open the door but they kept giggling. Just when I decided to walk off, I saw my friend came back with her children. I was shocked and asked her who was inside the house? She looked puzzled; she opened the door and no one inside. I later learned that she miscarriage the week before.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This happened to me while i was eight years old and my brother six years old. I remember my mum brought us to my grandma flat at Bona vista. During that night my mum and aunties decided  to stay for a night because it was getting late and the next day was sunday.<br><br>Because of the number of people staying during that night, some of us had to sleep in the living room, so my grandma took out the matresses and placed it in the living room. After that it was late enough and every one of us went to sleep. I recall my brother was sleeping in the living room which faced directly to the kitchen and i was the second one behind him.<br><br>In between the night when every one had slept soundedly, and was quite dark during that time, i opened my eyes and stared into the kitchen because i wanted to pee. There came a mature male lauging voice which was frigtening me. I quicky closed my eyes and the laughing voice stopped. Open my eyes again there came the laughing voice again. This time i was really terrified because the voice was instinctively heard and i knew it was not imagination.<br><br>To know where the thing was i turned my body facing the living room and opened my eyes this time there was no laughing voice, i saw my brother was sleeping beside me, followed by my mum and my aunties. To my amazement they were not disturbed and woke up by the laughing sound which i was hearing.<br><br>In order to prove that the thing was in kitchen i turned back facing the kitchen and opened up my eyes. The lauging sound came back again. This time i knew it was in the kitchen. It was so sensitively reponded to my opened eyes, opened 3/10 of my eyes the lauging came once again. From that point i dared not open my eyes again and waited until the next morning when the sun was risen. The next day i told my brother about my encounter, he told me that he had heard it also. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br></div>

She said they are a harmless spirit and are always present at funeral wakes to usher the deceased to the underworld..."</strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This story was related to me by my auntie which happened to her during her teenage time. At that time she was working as a receptionist in a dental clinic which was located in town area. One afternoon during lunch time, she and a collegue were staying behind because they still had things to do.<br><br>They saw the main entrance door opened by itself, a gust of wind passed them and they felt a chill in the air and saw this white headless figure entering the main entrance door and was walking pass them and entered into the dentist's room. At that time the dentist was not in his room because he had gone out for his meal. After caught sight of what they had seem, both my aunties and the female collegue were stunned and they fell sicked after the incident and did not turn up for work the next day.</div>
