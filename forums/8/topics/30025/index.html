            <div class='col-md body'>Sensational with the Nokia 7210<br><br>12 October 2002<br>Written by Kinny Cheng<br><br>Problems/Issues?<br>I may have come to appreciate the many new features offered on the 7210. But at the same time, I must say that I am somewhat disappointed with some of the limitations identified from reviewing the handset over the past week - as well as the physical anomalies mentioned previously.<br><br>Whatever your thoughts may be for this phone, the following are things that cannot be discounted if you plan on getting the 7210.<br><br>Cannot use custom ringtones for caller groups and message tones<br><br>This would probably top my list of complaints for the 7210. I was amazed to find out that it was not possible to use any of the ringtones that were stored in the Â“GalleryÂ” section of the phone for my caller group and message tones. These included polyphonic ringtones that came pre-loaded with the 7210 on purchase and any other loaded via IR/data cable (using the Nokia Sound Converter) or downloaded/received.<br><br>Okay, maybe I am stuck with some very basic tones for messages - but I would have expected full access to all available tones on my 7210 for caller group tones! On the 8310, I was able to use any tone for standard, caller group and message tones - and I (and most other people) would not expect any less from the 7210.<br><br>LetÂ’s just hope that this is a software bug and will be rectified in the next upgrade available!<br><br>Take a closer look!<br><br>Inconsistencies in build quality<br><br>It seems that Nokia hasnÂ’t learnt its lesson from the days of the 8310 - where issues such as continuous problems with phone firmware, inconsistent keypad tactility on various handsets, and differing white backlight colours (which made using the original white cover a big joke) plagued the well-being of this great little handset. Honestly, if you had managed to purchase an 8310 without any of these problems, you had a winner!<br><br>A year on, the 7210 is here - and along with it are those inconsistencies in build quality again. If you intend on spending big bucks on a phone like this, and realise that you have a handset with its plastic backing slightly raised - and your friendÂ’s one doesnÂ’t, I wouldnÂ’t be too happy about it.<br><br>Radio feature needs headset plugged in even whilst using speakerphone<br><br>One great feature of the 7210 is the ability to have the FM radioÂ’s audio fed through the polyphonic speakers - an alternate choice where I would not have to use the stereo headsets. Sounds all good, right? Wrong!<br><br>The queer thing here is that in order to have the FM radio use the speakers, you need to have the headset plugged into the phone for this to be ultimately possible. Like on previous Nokia models with the integrated FM radio, if the headset is not plugged into the phone the FM radio feature cannot be turned on. The same principle applies on the 7210 - where I think this should be addressed without question!<br><br>Like it or not, youÂ’ll still have to bring your 7210 stereo headset with you if you plan on using the FM radio feature. Until a possible fix is in place, donÂ’t leave home without it!<br><br>Take a closer look!<br><br>Volume and power buttons quite difficult to press<br><br>One of the consistent things about the two 7210 handsets used for this review is the difficulty in adjusting the volume and pressing the Â“powerÂ” button.<br><br>On previous Nokia models with dedicated volume buttons, you would notice a distinct Â“clickÂ” feel confirming that your action was physically successful. However, wanting that same level of certainty on the 7210 is another story. If you want to avoid being unsure, adjust the volume with greater pressure - preferably with your thumb, which is probably inconvenient for most of us using our right hand to hold the phone.<br><br>As for the power button, try poking it with your nails! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Xpress-on back cover not as easy to remove as previous models<br><br>ItÂ’s either IÂ’m hopeless at removing the 7210Â’s back cover, which I have done over at least 50 times already, or they have made it as hard to remove as possible so that you wonÂ’t consider getting another one!<br><br>I must hand it to Nokia for making the 7210 such a solid-feeling phone on the outside - but at the same time, if itÂ’s going to be less than easy to swap these, then probably permanent covers is the way to go. The 8310 - to date - still has the best Xpress-on cover designs in terms of easy removal and<br><br></div>
