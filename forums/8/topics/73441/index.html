            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm<br><br>I should make a detailed operation on this.<br><br>Firstly, i should recce the place and the vicinity on the area that is about to be attacked. Recon should be made 1 week prior to operation. Points to be made during recon will be the familiarity of the faces there e.g. customers,employees or trade partners. If a bank or depository is to be aimed at. Detailed observation should be made regarding the shifts of the security there and the position of the security camers or CCTV. Security of the place can be broken down by pointing out their alertness, strengths and weaknesses. During recon,you should find out the time period whereby the bank or depository is not busy or lax. Plans should also be made for the getaway. i.e. the position of getaway vehicle, placing obstructions for easy getaway.<br><br>Disclaimer : Points given should not be followed and i will not be responsible<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You guys are pathetic haha!<br><br>When i was 12 I thought of this good plan to rob a local bank, the means with which I planned it later, or recently, was used by Russian police/counter-terrorists to clear some theathre of terrorists. That reflects well on my thinking <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">, maybe its the tainted blood bull that is making sense.<br><br>Anywayz. Assuming you have the resources you need. To rob a bank, one must always try to get an insider to aid you, it makes things a hell lot easier. I wanted to rob this DBS bank at bukit timah plaza back in 95, cos it was right next to the road, very quick/easy to escape in terms of time. Now what I would have done, given I had resources and shit, and the help of an insider.<br><br>Insiders:1. Manager of the plaza shopping centre, used to give me keys and access to air-ducts. + A group of janitors and cleaners with their waxing equipment + delivery workmen carrying heavy duty stuff. Janitors used to blockade the bank exit inside the building using wax/work excuses. Deilvery workmen used to barricade the bank exit outside the building using "deilvery-heavy-duty-transportation" excuse.<br><br>2. Police security guys in the bank + the lady nearest to the alarm console, + the observer in the security monitoring room. Police guys will be responsible for closing the doors when the time comes. Lady responsible for getting in the way of the alarm console button. Oberserver responsible for removing video tape/erasing visual records of the robbery.<br><br>3. Manager of the bank. Paid to shut up and not do anything, other then to tell the bank tellers to shut up and carry on with their job... ofcourse in a non-suspicious manner.<br><br>Plan: Robbers gain access to ventilation air ducts. They begin work about isolating vents that connect "breathable outside air" to the bank's interior. Having done that, they pump in sleeping gas.<br><br>While they are doing this. Janitors begin cleaning around the area inside the building, just outside the bank's exit. THey use wax and other cleaning methods to make that area "off-limits" while they clean. This will stop people from entering the bank from inside the mall. Ofcourse, they will try to clean as much area as possible so passerbyes won't see what goes on in the bank.<br><br>Meanwhile, paid dirty-cops inside the bank will slowly close curtains of the bank.<br><br>Delivery workmen are outside the building, unloading crap at the bank exit on the outside, making the path of the entrance to the bank inaccessible for a while.<br><br>Sleeping gas takes effect, people collapse. Our hired police-men and insiders will brandish masks and begin their work. Police men lock the entrance of the bank facing the interior of the building and clear away the fainted bodies. Our delivery workers RUSH into the bank and take what they want ($$$$).<br><br>Our friends in the air ducts evacuate, leaving the gas on.<br><br>Janitors will finish their shift.<br><br>Security operator will erase all record tapes, before removing his gas mask and fainting like the others. The manager will also do this, followed by the policemen.<br><br>Our boys having got the money in backpacks will take off their white "delivery service" overalls, revealing them wearing jogging shorts and singlets, and rush out of the bank to jog away from the crime scene. Having left behind their delivery trucks and heavy shit blocking the walkways, which will take some time to clear.<br><br>Meanwhile the manager of the mall will be paid to be silent and to tell the information coutner ladies to ignore "complaints" and be "difficult".<br><br>That is my planned robbery back in 95, when i was 10 or 12 years old. Not bad eh? It prolly wont work now. But the COOL thing is, the theory worked in Russia to clear a thearthre full of criminals.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh yeah, something i should make clear. Cos i thought it would be damned obvious: BEFORE any of your robbers enter the bank, they wear nylon STOCKINGS first.<br><br>Plan B assuming you CANNOT bribe anyone from the bank to get their insider cooperation:<br><br>Everything as usual. Accept before you switch on the gas. U need a hacker/geek nerd to cut phone lines and communication from the bank to the outside world. U will also need an EMP device to disrupt the use of handphones within the bank. U get keys from the manager of the building, lock the doors of the bank INCONSPICIOUSLY<br><br>U switch on the gass, EVERYONE faints, you unlock the doors, have your crooks enter and rob the place and leave.<br><br>Assuming you know exactly where the money is kept and all that shit. Also assuming the gas you use is non-detectable by human standards and its effect is instantaneous. Such gas is acquriable.<br><br>But then again ofcouse. No criminal in SG would be able to acquire such sleeping gas. But this robbery is one that does not require weaponry.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Plan C. Assuming you dont have the resources mentioned above.<br><br>Cheaper plan with less planning: Requires: 1 gun or lethal projectile weapon, or if you are skilled, knife.<br><br>Also needs an animal suit, or a costume to disguise your identity.<br><br>Plan: With costume and shit all on, plus an alibi in some other location. You walk into the bank, grab the nearest important person and have a hold up. The alarms will go, you will get in a frenzy with the policemen<br><br>"Drop it!"<br><br>"NO! you drop it!"<br><br>"NO **** you, DROP IT!"<br><br>"NO ***** YOU!! YOU DROP IT"<br><br>etc etc etc<br><br>Which will eventually result in the police giving in, since cavalry is on the way. They will drop it. You have little time before SWAT comes. So you quickly get hostages arranged and unarm the police dudes, cuff em somewhere. Most importantly you get money together. You must isolate all hostages in the vault or some other room where they wont be able to see you communicating with the police.<br><br>You make contact with the police, stating some demands and stuff to buy time. As the police comply with some demands, you let out one hostage, until you  have 1 or 2 left or something.<br><br>Later on, you take off your costume, put the money in your underwear or someplace, and exit the bank pretending to be a hostage, and escape <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Ofcourse. This is assuming Singapore's Bored and dull trigger-happy STARS team doesn't burst in shooting u in the head without blinking.<br><br>No offence to anyone from the armed forces or police. I am merely stating that you guys don't get much action, so in such a situation you would be READY and efficient, and DYING to get some action rather than waste time negotiating.<br><br>Weird ideas i have huh?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by men_@_arms:</div><div class="quote_body">You guys are pathetic haha!<br><br>When i was 12 I thought of this good plan to rob a local bank, the means with which I planned it later, or recently, was used by Russian police/counter-terrorists to clear some theathre of terrorists. That reflects well on my thinking <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">, maybe its the tainted blood bull that is making sense.<br><br>Anywayz. Assuming you have the resources you need. To rob a bank, one must always try to get an insider to aid you, it makes things a hell lot easier. I wanted to rob this DBS bank at bukit timah plaza back in 95, cos it was right next to the road, very quick/easy to escape in terms of time. Now what I would have done, given I had resources and shit, and the help of an insider.<br><br>Insiders:1. Manager of the plaza shopping centre, used to give me keys and access to air-ducts. + A group of janitors and cleaners with their waxing equipment + delivery workmen carrying heavy duty stuff. Janitors used to blockade the bank exit inside the building using wax/work excuses. Deilvery workmen used to barricade the bank exit outside the building using "deilvery-heavy-duty-transportation" excuse.<br><br>2. Police security guys in the bank + the lady nearest to the alarm console, + the observer in the security monitoring room. Police guys will be responsible for closing the doors when the time comes. Lady responsible for getting in the way of the alarm console button. Oberserver responsible for removing video tape/erasing visual records of the robbery.<br><br>3. Manager of the bank. Paid to shut up and not do anything, other then to tell the bank tellers to shut up and carry on with their job... ofcourse in a non-suspicious manner.<br><br>Plan: Robbers gain access to ventilation air ducts. They begin work about isolating vents that connect "breathable outside air" to the bank's interior. Having done that, they pump in sleeping gas.<br><br>While they are doing this. Janitors begin cleaning around the area inside the building, just outside the bank's exit. THey use wax and other cleaning methods to make that area "off-limits" while they clean. This will stop people from entering the bank from inside the mall. Ofcourse, they will try to clean as much area as possible so passerbyes won't see what goes on in the bank.<br><br>Meanwhile, paid dirty-cops inside the bank will slowly close curtains of the bank.<br><br>Delivery workmen are outside the building, unloading crap at the bank exit on the outside, making the path of the entrance to the bank inaccessible for a while.<br><br>Sleeping gas takes effect, people collapse. Our hired police-men and insiders will brandish masks and begin their work. Police men lock the entrance of the bank facing the interior of the building and clear away the fainted bodies. Our delivery workers RUSH into the bank and take what they want ($$$$).<br><br>Our friends in the air ducts evacuate, leaving the gas on.<br><br>Janitors will finish their shift.<br><br>Security operator will erase all record tapes, before removing his gas mask and fainting like the others. The manager will also do this, followed by the policemen.<br><br>Our boys having got the money in backpacks will take off their white "delivery service" overalls, revealing them wearing jogging shorts and singlets, and rush out of the bank to jog away from the crime scene. Having left behind their delivery trucks and heavy shit blocking the walkways, which will take some time to clear.<br><br>Meanwhile the manager of the mall will be paid to be silent and to tell the information coutner ladies to ignore "complaints" and be "difficult".<br><br>That is my planned robbery back in 95, when i was 10 or 12 years old. Not bad eh? It prolly wont work now. But the COOL thing is, the theory worked in Russia to clear a thearthre full of criminals.<br><br></div></blockquote>haha at the rate you pay the "insiders" you'll prob have to rob 2 banks instead of one</div>
