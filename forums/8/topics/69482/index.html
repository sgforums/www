            <div class='col-md body'>well, as a general rule of thumb, maturity comes with age because you experience more things as u get older...<br><br>it all depends, if someone aged 18 gets to experience pregnancy, divorce, family problems etc, she will be generally more mature than other 18-yr-olds who do not get to experience all these.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
