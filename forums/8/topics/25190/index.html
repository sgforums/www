            <div class='col-md body'>Heavenly Thing -Singapore Strait Times - 18 Aug 2002<br><br>Ageless pop prince Aaron Kwok proves his appeal extends all the way to the Land of Rising Sun<br><br>By Samuel Lee<br><br>LANGUAGE is no barrier to Aaron Kwok's popularity in Japan. Last week, the Hongkong Heavenly King, who admits to speaking Japanese 'very badly', staged three successful concerts in Osaka, Tokyo and Yokohoma. Each attracted an estimated crowd of 10,000.<br><br>'When I perform, I talk with my body language,' he said in Mandarin laced with a strong Cantonese accent last Friday night.<br><br>Speaking to Singapore reporters in his suite at the Akasaka Crown Prince Hotel in Tokyo, he was fresh and perky, having showered after his gig at the Tokyo International Forum (see concert review).<br><br>During the two-hour show, he sweet-talked the audience in Japanese, which he said he learnt two months ago. His cooing drove the crowd crazy, even though his set comprised Cantonese and Mandarin songs, except for one Japanese number.<br><br>His appeal, say fans like university undergraduate Yumi Nomura, lies in his Peter Pan good looks, impressive high-energy dance sequences, and a showmanship that has been polished to perfection.<br><br>Ms Nomura, 23, was there with her 25-year-old sister, Masae. 'He sings well and is a great dancer. Besides, he's kakkoii ne,' she said with a giggle.<br><br>Cries of kakkoii, Japanese for cute and dashing, vied with chants of 'A-e-ron' in the auditorium.<br><br>CONQUERING JAPAN<br><br>ANOTHER boon to his growing appeal in the Land of the Rising Sun is his roles in films with a Japanese connection.<br><br>These include 1998's Anna Magdalena and last year's Para Para Sakura and China Strike Force.<br><br>'There are more people coming to see me compared to my first performance here six or seven years ago,' he said with a grin as he shared a box of okashi (Japanese snacks) with the journalists in the room.<br><br>'Many have seen my movies and wanted to get a first-hand experience of my reputation as a livewire on stage.'<br><br>Para Para cashed in on the made-in-Japan interactive arcade dance craze of the same name, while Anna Magdalena also featured heart-throb Takeshi Kaneshiro.<br><br>China Strike Force starred the babelicious Norika Fujiwara, with whom Kwok is linked romantically.<br><br>He confirmed reports that she was at last Wednesday's Osaka show with her parents and younger brother.<br><br>After the concert, she was spotted backstage with a bouquet. But he insisted there was nothing romantic between them.<br><br>'We're just very good friends.'<br><br>Kwok, who turns 37 in October, said he is still single, but will give up his bacherlorhood to start a family with someone he really fancies.<br><br>'Don't be fooled by my flashy, playboy image. I'm prepared to settle down if the right one comes along at the right time - which is not now.'<br><br>For now, he wants to milk his popularity for what it's worth.<br><br>He said: 'Who knows where I'll be in three years' time?'<br><br>NO FLASH IN THE PAN<br><br>STARTING out as a dancer in Hongkong's TVB station in 1983, he was earning a meagre monthly wage of HK$120 (S$27), but became hot property in 1990 after appearing in a Taiwanese advertisement for Honda motorbikes.<br><br>He sparked a bidding war among record labels, which had not even heard him sing.<br><br>The hugely popular title track in his debut album, Never Stop Loving You (1990), made him a household name in Hongkong, Taiwan and South-east Asia.<br><br>Four albums and two years later, he earned the title of Heavenly King, and was crowned alongside Jacky Cheung, Andy Lau and Leon Lai.<br><br>Still, critics saw him as a flash in the pan, with little to offer than good looks and a pair of nimble feet.<br><br>Proving them wrong, he has since released more than 38 albums and has acted in at least 25 movies and three television series. Last year, his estimated worth was HK$58 million.<br><br>His concerts here, such as the two at the Singapore Indoor Stadium in April last year, played to full-houses. Of the 8,000 tickets available for his upcoming gig on Sept 6, 90 per cent have already been sold.<br><br>The show will feature new songs from his upcoming greatest hits album out next month, such as The Great Love Party and Saviour.<br><br>'It's a whole new sound, and a sexier Aaron Kwok. I want fans to know I'm not lazy,' he said.<br><br>His next target is Korea, and he is working on songs to cater to female listeners there.<br><br>'Women in different markets have differing tastes. They also taste different,' he said.<br><br>Now, did he say people should not be fooled by his playboy image?<br><br>Catch Aaron Kwok Red Hot Live In Concert at the Singapore Indoor Stadium on Sept 6 at 8 pm. Tickets at $89, $109 and $139 from Sistic (tel: 6348-5555 or www.sistic.com.sg). For more information, visit www.jpentertainment.com.sg. Watch snippets of his Tokyo concert and interview in U Entertainment on Channel U at 7 pm tonight.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Razzle dazzle<br>CONCERT<br>AARON KWOK LIVE<br>ON STAGE IN JAPAN CONCERT TOUR 2002<br>Tokyo International Forum<br>Last Friday<br><br>MID-WAY through his 27-song set, the Heavenly King descended the stage and asked his fans to come forward to shake his hand.<br><br>And they did, swarming to the front of the hall.<br><br>There were no burly security guards, surly police officers or metal barricades separating him from the sea of female worshippers.<br><br>But there was a curious clockwork synchronicity with which the 10,000 Japanese concert-goers responded to his music.<br><br>As soon the opening bars to a song hinted at something upbeat, they would stand en masse, swaying with a regularity that reflects the neat, clinical lines along which Japanese society is run.<br><br>The moment the tempo dropped, they would return to their seats, before repeating the above sequence when the pace picked up again.<br><br>Even the concert had a rhythmic routine to it.<br><br>Each of its six segments would start with a robust lead-in by Kwok's nubile dancers before he emerged, either on the raised dais in the middle of the stage or through the open door beneath it.<br><br>After the fast number, the dancers would exit, leaving him to engage in cheeky Japanese chatter, mostly a declaration of love for Japan, Japanese food like shabu shabu and sashimi, and, needless to say, his Japanese fans.<br><br>A ballad or two would follow before he closed each segment on a high note. His dancers would then reappear.<br><br>His Tokyo show was also marked by four Gs: gloss, groove, gimmicks and goose-pimples.<br><br>Most of his wardrobe screamed camp and clash.<br><br>Some examples: A black-and-white Moschino jacket crammed full of letters of the alphabet worn over a checker-board T-shirt; and a gold mock-turtleneck paired with red jeans.<br><br>But these clashes seemed appropriate when coupled with his dramatic dance moves. Indeed, his fancy footwork rivals that of Michael Jackson's.<br><br>But what was truly amazing was how he lost neither breath nor pitch after a strenuous 10-minute Latin medley.<br><br>On Transcending Time &amp; Space, he sang Japanese lyrics to the tune of his Mandarin hit. Though gimmicky and unprecise in diction, he steamrolled the audience.<br><br>Predictably, they greeted his effort with shrieks, as they did his cringe-inducing attempts at connecting with them in Japanese.<br><br>'There are lots of hot springs in Japan. I'd love to invite you to come soak with me. But then, I'm such a shy guy...'<br><br>Yeah, right.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Leon lies low - 20 Aug 2002<br><br>He's happy to hold court on any subject, but Hongkong Heavenly King Leon Lai bristles when asked about actresses linked to him like Shu Qi and Zhang Ziyi<br><br>By Clara Chow<br><br>LEON LAI is touchy about his love life.<br><br>In town on Monday to promote his new horror trilogy, Three, the 35-year-old Hongkong singer-actor refused to talk about it. He would not even say whether he has a girlfriend.<br><br>'This is my personal life. I feel I don't have to tell anyone. Thank you,' he said in Mandarin.<br><br>Wearing a T-shirt, Japanese brand Evisu blue jeans, sneakers and Yves Saint Laurent sunglasses, he clammed up when asked about rumoured on-off girlfriend, sexy Taiwanese actress Shu Qi, 25.<br><br>'I feel I don't have any need to tell anyone,' he said, leaning back in his chair to distance himself from the query.<br><br>Japan's Asaka Seto, 25, and China's Zhang Ziyi, 22, - two other actresses once linked to him - are also no-fly zones with him.<br><br>Seto starred with him in last year's Bullets Of Love, and drowned her sorrows in alcohol reportedly after their rumoured romance ended.<br><br>The 1.78-m tall and 68-kg actor would not say if he still keeps in contact with her or Zhang.<br><br>Lai's irritation showed despite the soft, level tone of his voice.<br><br>He also refrained from commenting on Hongkong bad boy singer-actor Nicholas Tse taking a break from making movies, and on Zhang being voted one of the world's 10 ugliest women by Britain's For Him Magazine (FHM).<br><br>But the media-savvy entertainer regained his composure quickly.<br><br>Minutes after the questions were put to him, he posed for a photograph with some reporters after his Straits Times Interactive webchat, which took place on Monday afternoon. He left Singapore for Hongkong yesterday evening.<br><br>Perhaps being testy with journalists comes with the territory of being a Heavenly King.<br><br>Together with Andy Lau, Aaron Kwok and Jacky Cheung, he has worn this tag for at least a decade.<br><br>Lai was careful to portray himself as understanding of the media.<br><br>'I don't have any way of coping with the invasion of my privacy,' he said, a little too quickly perhaps.<br><br>'Reporters have a right to write what they think can sell the paper and earn their wages. But if all newspapers write the same thing, won't readers be numb and stop reading?'<br><br>Yet scandal has dogged his career from its outset.<br><br>Born in Beijing, Lai's family migrated to Hongkong when he was six years old. He was 23 when he first appeared on the Hongkong entertainment scene as a singer and television actor.<br><br>In 1990, he released his debut solo album, Meeting In The Rain. TV serials such as The Challenge Of Life (1990) and The Breaking Point (1991) propelled him to heart-throb status.<br><br>He cemented his brooding lover image with film roles such as Fallen Angels (1995) and Comrades: Almost A Love Story (1996). In City Of Glass (199<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">, he starred with Shu Qi, and the two soon became an item.<br><br>As early as 1993, however, the press had a field day with reports about actress Athena Chu Yan seducing Lai on the set of TVB serial Legend Of The Lone Ranger. She later denied them.<br><br>Recently, the heat has been on him and Shu Qi. After a rumoured split with her three years ago, he downed sleeping pills in a suspected suicide attempt, providing more fodder for the tabloids.<br><br>Not many would have guessed that this clean-cut man would generate such frenzied dirt-digging.<br><br>But his support for the Chinese government has also kicked up controversy.<br><br>Last year, he was said to be a contender to sing the theme song at the Beijing 2008 Olympics, although the Chinese government has yet to confirm this.<br><br>Predictably, he said he rooted for China during the World Cup two months ago.<br><br>And given a chance to turn back the clock, he would change things so that the 'Chinese will have a stronger sense of pride'.<br><br>His new movie, Three, is a culmination of not just Chinese pride, however, but also Asian pride.<br><br>The film, produced by regional film company Applause, is made up of three spooky stories. The first two are directed by Korea's Kim Jee Woon and Thailand's Nonzee Nimibutr (Jan Dara).<br><br>In the third part of Three, Going Home, he is Chinese physician Yu Fai. Yu moves to Hongkong in search of the good life, only to find that his beloved wife (Eugenia Yuan) is dying of liver cancer. He soaks his wife's body in Chinese medicinal herbs daily to keep her soul in her body<br><br>The segment is directed by Peter Chan Ho-Sun, who also directed Lai in City Of Glass.<br><br>In one scene, Lai has to bathe Yuan's naked body. The PG film was censored here to tone down the nudity.<br><br>Already in Hongkong, reporters have made an issue of the connotations of necrophilia in the scene.<br><br>This angered the actor, who believed the media's picking on only one scene detracts from the movie as a whole. Still, he was willing to discuss the scene.<br><br>'Please ask,' he urged this reporter politely.<br><br>He said, with a serious expression: 'It was not difficult at all.' He and Yuan filmed the scene in less than an hour.<br><br>He added: 'It's like when I was young and my Dad bathed me. I also imagined it to be how I'd bathe my parents when they are old.'<br><br>He was equally evasive about the chemistry between him and his fresh-faced co-star.<br><br>'Whether sparks fly between us is up to the audience to decide after watching the movie,' he would only say.<br><br>After all these years, he still has baby-smooth skin. About the only change is that he looks slightly thinner.<br><br>Indeed, retirement is far from his mind. The subject made him think for a long hard moment.<br><br>He looked off in the distance, exhaled loudly and said after a long pause: 'I think it's hard to answer. It's up to whether the market needs you.'<br><br>Hongkong singer-actor Tse announced this month that he was taking a break from showbusiness.<br><br>Two months ago, Hongkong singer-actress Sammi Cheng squashed rumours that she was to retire, too.<br><br>But Lai came up with an analogy for his own career's future: 'A lighter burning at full blast will run out of gas quickly. The same thing goes for my shelf life. I'd rather just be burning slowly.'<br><br>Then he was whisked away for his next publicity engagement.<br><br>The fragrant pop idol charm he exuded seemed to linger in the air after him. And despite being prickly on some topics, he came and left with nary a wrinkle on his face.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>LAI ON...<br><br>RETIRING<br><br>'If people think about retirement, the earth will come to an end. People must never retire. They must keep going, learning, and educating the next generation.'<br><br>LOVE<br><br>'I believe there is true love. But whether it can last, I don't know.'<br><br>SPIRIT WORLD<br><br>'I believe there are spirits in the world, but I can't be sure. And I don't want to be sure.'<br><br>FILMING THREE<br><br>'I was supposed to knock my co-star Eric Tsang's head with a clock, but of course not for real. But I knocked really hard for better effect.'<br><br>READING<br><br>'I do not like to read, butI like people to tell me what they have read. I will read the book if I like what I hear. My assistant highlights the important things for me.'<br><br>CLOTHES<br><br>'If I buy them myself, they'll be classier.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Congenial Eugenia<br><br>No media jitters for starlet, especially with veteran-actress Mum in tow<br><br>IT IS not every day a fledgling starlet's mother turns up at a press conference.<br><br>It creates more of a stir when the mother in question is veteran Taiwanese gongfu actress Cheng Pei Pei.<br><br>Cheng, 56, who is best known to younger cinema-goers as Jade Fox in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, was in Singapore to accompany and support her daughter Eugenia Yuan, who is in her 20s. Cheng last appeared in a Hongkong movie called Shadow Mask last year.<br><br>Yuan is Cheng's elder daughter with her Shanghainese businessman husband. The couple have another daughter, Marsha, 24, a former Miss Hongkong runner-up who has appeared in Hongkong television serials.<br><br>Yuan was in town with Leon Lai to promote their new movie, Three, at a press conference in The Fullerton Hotel.<br><br>Her mother sat in the back row, smiled but said little to the media.<br><br>But the long-haired girl said she was not fazed by the attention she receives because of her mother.<br><br>She said, speaking calmly in an American accent: 'Everyone's somebody's daughter or someone's son.'<br><br>She added: 'I'm very proud of my mother. She is my idol.'<br><br>Cheng is best known for her cool, graceful swords-woman roles in 1960s movies like Come Drink With Me (1965) and Golden Swallow (196<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">.<br><br>'EVERYONE'S SOMEBODY'S DAUGHTER OR SOMEONE'S SON.

She started out in ballet, Chinese dance and contemporary dance, before branching out into acting.<br><br>In the past 13 years, she has appeared in small roles in American television series like Beverly Hills 90210, Martial Law and NYPD Blue.<br><br>She has also appeared in obscure films such as last year's Charlotte Sometimes, directed by American Eric Byler. She played the alluring love interest of a mechanic.<br><br>The best thing about working with Lai, she said, was 'the professionalism and care he has for another actor'.<br><br>She said she was bothered by the hype surrounding the corpse-bathing scene in the film, saying 'the movie is so much more than that'.<br><br>The actress, whom some describe as Asia's Julia Roberts because of her wide generous mouth and big eyes, smiled demurely for the cameras.<br><br>During the press conference, she - unlike most helpless starlets - helped TV crew re-position the microphones in front of her.<br><br>When the conference ended, mother and daughter put their arms around each other and posed for pictures.<br><br>Both were dressed in red - Yuan in a red paisley-print smoking jacket, Cheng in a crimson caftan.<br><br>They held hands and left the ballroom together.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore is the sum of our dreams, our fears, our sweat - 18 aug 2002<br>MONEY is not enough in the effort to build an enduring Singapore.<br><br>After all, when a major recession comes along, what is to stop people from leaving for greener pastures?<br><br>Advertisement<br><br>So, for Singaporeans to feel rooted here, they must have a deep sense of belonging and see this island as a home for themselves, where their family and friends are, said Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong last night.<br><br>He noted that the Remaking Singapore Committee, chaired by Minister of State for National Development Vivian Balakrishnan, was looking for ways to root Singaporeans to the country.<br><br>Reflecting on the issue at the close of his rally speech, he said he agreed with the Singaporean who wrote to The Straits Times that if Singapore expected its citizens to die for the country, 'there must be something beyond material things that is worth dying for'.<br><br>Said Mr Goh: 'He is right. Economic competitiveness alone will not build us an enduring Singapore.'<br><br>He added that while physical comfort can be enjoyed anywhere else in the world, there is only one place where Singaporeans can control their destiny, only one place which they can truly call home.<br><br>Ultimately, the people will stay and defend the country if they feel that it is their home, he said.<br><br>'If they feel Singapore is home, then they will stay and fight for Singapore. Even if they are overseas, they will return and fight. They will work with passion and conviction for our future. They will make sure that Singapore continues to progress and prosper.'<br><br>Adding a personal note, he recounted how he once lived in a house with no electricity and modern sanitation until his family moved to a three-room Housing Board flat in Queenstown.<br><br>He paid tribute to the grit of the older generation which had built Singapore and turned it into a place where every Singaporean had a roof over his head, with quality education and health care, a green and beautiful environment, and vibrant arts, sports, leisure and entertainment scene.<br><br>'For me, this is home because my family, my friends, my people are here. My memories are here. My hopes are here.'<br><br>'This is home because we built it. Every Singaporean has given a part of himself, big or small, to the country.<br><br>Singapore is the sum of our dreams, our fears, our sweat. It reflects who we are, and what we want to be.<br><br>'When we proclaim that we are Singaporeans, we are expressing our belief in the Singapore way of life, and in our shared values - a multiracial and multi-religious society, meritocracy, compassion, justice, equality, hard work, determination, and excellence in whatever we do.<br><br>'We are proud of our achievements, and grateful for the opportunities and the good life that the country has given us.<br><br>'And every dollar we donate, every feedback that we give, every idea that we offer, reflects our dreams for a better Singapore.<br><br>'You will not feel this same sense of belonging anywhere else.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>FROM THIRD WORLD PLUMBING TO...<br><br>PM Goh Chok Tong paid tribute to the struggle of the older generation to build this nation. He recounted how he had lived in a house with no modern sanitation and electricity. The older generation's efforts enabled many like him to move into modern Housing Board flats. He called on the young to show the same grit in tackling the challenges facing the nation, rather than quit at the first sign of trouble.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>OPPORTUNITIES TO CAPITALISE ON<br><br>'It was really inspiring. What the PM said today is that we have many things going for us. There are many opportunities that could be capitalised on, like in China, India and the region, and I think Singaporeans should open their minds to them.'<br>- Mr Ahmad Mohamed Magad, 49, MP (Pasir Ris-Punggol)<br><br>PASSIONATE ENCOURAGEMENT<br><br>'It was a passionate Line is overdrawn speech that tried to encourage and lift the nation. But I don't think the pessimism has been lifted, because politicians can't do much about the economy.'<br>- Mr Chandra Mohan Nair, 59, nominated MP<br><br>A FRESH ANGLE ON THE PICTURE<br><br>'Although there are uncertainties Line is overdrawn and challenges, Line is overdrawn they are not insur- mountable. Line is overdrawn PM Goh has given a fresh angle to the whole picture. For instance, there are a lot of opportunities even as China is on the rise. As for the transport fare hike, he is seeking to reassure Singaporeans that the Government does listen to feedback. '<br>-Dr Amy Khor, 43, MP for Hong Kah GRC<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>A PERSONAL AND HONEST MESSAGE<br><br>'The whole striking aspect of the speech is the PM's personal response to what makes him root for Singapore. He has shared his own reasons for staying in Singapore, as a man, not so much as a PM. I think that this will dispel the gloom, as his message came across as very personal, and was an honest assessment.'<br>- Dr Ng Eng Hen, 43, Minister of State (Education, Manpower)<br><br>IT HELPS PEOPLE UNDERSTAND<br><br>'The ground should understand more about GST and tax changes, after this speech. It's good that he explained it because a lot of residents have come to grassroots leaders and MPs to complain about the issue. The PM's speech would help us in explaining to the people.'<br>- Mr Michael Tee, 52, grassroots leader in Holland- Bukit Panjang GRC<br><br>RIGHT FROM THE HEART<br><br>'I think it was a very good speech. It came from the heart of the man. This is our PM who has been looking at the problems seriously. I was moved towards the last part, when he tried to rally the people. Tonight was really - like what I've said - a rallying call.'<br>- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim, 47, Acting Minister for Community Development and Sports<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Stricter rules for Chinese medicines<br>By Salma Khalik<br>HEALTH CORRESPONDENT<br><br>CHINESE medicines will have to meet stricter testing and labelling requirements before they can be sold here.<br><br>The new Health Ministry rules require:<br><br>The products to be labelled clearly - 'Allowed for sale as a Chinese Proprietary Medicine' (CPM) - from January, to distinguish them from Western drugs.<br><br>Every consignment to be accompanied by a test report from an accredited laboratory, from January 2004.<br><br>Higher risk products, like those for slimming and impotence, to be subjected to even more stringent tests.<br><br>Factories making the medicines to have good quality control.<br><br>Health Minister Lim Hng Kiang announced the changes yesterday, which are aimed at preventing another Slim 10-style tragedy, where a woman died and another needed a liver transplant after taking the made-in-China slimming pills.<br><br>But he cautioned that no matter what regulations were in place, the consumer was ultimately responsible for what he bought.<br><br>So while Singapore will have some of the world's most stringent rules controlling the sale of Chinese medicines, Mr Lim stressed: 'The Health Sciences Authority cannot give Singaporeans a blanket guarantee that CPM from now on will be safe.'<br><br>The rules only apply to Chinese medicines made from a combination of compounds. Herbs can still be brought in without fuss.<br><br>And they do not apply to non-Chinese traditional compounds like Indonesian jamu, as there have been no serious problems involving these products, said Dr Clarence Tan, the Health Sciences Authority's (HSA) chief executive officer.<br><br>The new testing requirements were needed because, unlike Western drugs which must list their chemical ingredients, Chinese medicines contain many natural animal and plant materials.<br><br>But the tests will only eliminate known harmful compounds, which is why the manufacturing process must be audited to weed out 'backyard factories'.<br><br>The HSA is talking to regulators in countries like China, Taiwan and Malaysia about using their checks as a guarantee of quality.p&gt; Singapore already has an arrangement with Australia.<br><br>Without such guarantees from the country of import, HSA officials may need to inspect overseas factories.<br><br>Mr Lim said China plans to regulate manufacturing of health products by 2004.<br><br>The new regulations will, however, raise the price of Chinese medicines. For example, laboratory test reports will cost about $500 to $1,000 per consignment, which will be passed on to the consumer.<br><br>There are 9,800 Chinese medicines sold here, compared to about 7,500 Western medicines. But Chinese medicine sales account for only $15 million to $20 million, or about 5 per cent of the $400 million to $500 million worth of medicines sold here annually.<br><br>The ministry's move was welcomed by Eu Yan Sang, the biggest player here.<br><br>Mr Richard Eu, its chief executive officer, said his company 'does everything right' when producing its own Chinese medicines. But when others cut corners, it gives the whole industry a bad name.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Costs of losing weight<br><br>Chinese slimming pills, which had by last month killed four Japanese and left more than 200 ailing, are readily available in the local cosmetics shops and pharmacies. Last month, Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare confirmed that the slimmers fell ill after using the products, many with liver or thyroid problems.<br><br>Tests show that the pills contain a potentially dangerous substance called fenfluramine.<br><br>The Food and Drug Administration pulled fenfluramine out of the American market in 1997 after it was found to cause damage to heart valves when consumed with other slimming products. Other reports said the substance was thought to cause acute high blood pressure.<br><br>Although fenfluramine is classified as a medical substance, the pills are imported and sold locally as food items.<br><br>Fenfluramine was one of the substances in Slim 10, a diet pill imported from China. It was removed from store shelves in Singapore earlier this year following the death of a 43-year-old woman and the falling ill of at least 20 more.<br><br>Last week, a South Korean woman in hospital with acute hepatitis was suspected to have been using diet pills from China, making the government adopt tougher measures to crack down on a rising tide of banned diet pills.<br><br>Medical authorities in Singapore say Slim 10, the weight-cut import from China, was adulterated after it was tested and cleared for sale in Singapore. It was subsequently found to contain fenfluramine. The pills on sale in Singapore, like elsewhere, did not list this substance or another harmful chemical, nicotined, among the ingredients. At least 16 Singaporeans who took it developed thyroid problems and liver failure.<br><br>In May, the World Health Organisation called for further clinical research to establish the safety and efficacy of Chinese herbal remedies, used mainly in developing countries. According to the WHO Traditional Medicine Strategy 2002-2005, incorrect use of alternative therapies had caused several deaths even in developed countries.<br><br>Slim 10 is readily available in Nairobi. In one cosmetic shop in Embakasi, it costs Sh3,500 for a dose that promises to give the right shape and size for users, while elsewhere in the city centre a dose goes for between Sh3,500 and Sh4,500<br><br>Many Kenyan women in search of the "right shape and size" have been won over by traditional Chinese beauty aids sold as diet pills. Some are labelled in Chinese while others are repackaged in containers which do not indicate their ingredients.<br><br>Many Chinese clinics where we made enquiries were suspicious of questions on the products, especially after the international media reported the deaths in Japan.<br><br>Last week, British researchers reported that they had found fenfluramine in Chinese herbal remedies for weight loss.<br><br>A research report by Dr Joelle L. Nortier published in the New England Journal of Medicine said some of the slimming teas in local shops and elsewhere contained other dangerous substances - ephedra and ephedrine.<br><br>Ephedra refers to several related species of herbs while ephedrine is one of many chemical derivatives of the herb. Chinese ephedra (ephedra equisetina), also known as desert herb or Ma Huang, mainly grows in that country.<br><br>It has proved to be an effective aid for weight loss. It has a thermogenic effect; it increases the base metabolic rate, slightly raising body temperature and causing calories to be burned at a faster rate. However, it also increases the pulse rate and elevates blood pressure.<br><br>In Canada and other developed countries, the sale of some products containing ephedra have also been prohibited.<br><br>Some items in Nairobi outlets have ephedra and are sold under different trade names as weight loss products, some labelled: "Go from fat to firm in just a few weeks. Each capsule contains: Ephedra (Ma Huang extract 6 per cent - 133.5 mg). It burns fat, boosts energy, controls appetite and tones muscles. It FIGHTS fat, stress, fatigue and depression."<br><br>But its side effects include strokes and heart attacks, irregular heartbeat, seizures and psychosis. Some deaths have been attributed to use of products containing ephedra and/or ephedrine.<br><br>Therefore, ephedra is not recommended for people with high blood pressure or heart problems. It may also cause problems for those who suffer from insomnia and panic attacks.<br><br>Reputable manufacturers warn of these dangers on the label but in some cases, the warning is left out.<br><br>The danger of some of the weight loss products is enhanced by the practice of many herbal manufacturers to spike their ephedra-containing products with caffeine through herbs such as guarana seeds or cola nuts.<br><br>Caffeine by itself can elevate blood pressure and cause heart palpitations. When combined with ephedra, the potential danger is increased.<br><br>Given its stimulating and appetite-suppressing properties, ephedra has been adopted as an "energy" pill and is key in many weight-reduction programmes. In recent years, more than 1,000 serious toxic reactions have been attributed to the use of this herb in the United States.<br><br>A decade ago, more than 100 otherwise healthy young women in Belgium developed irreversible kidney failure, requiring dialysis or organ transplants. Half of them subsequently developed kidney cancer. These women had one thing in common: They all received a cocktail of slimming drugs containing Chinese herbs at the same weight-reduction clinic. The toxic product was identified as aristolochia (also known as birthwort), a herb used for centuries in traditional folk medicine.<br><br>This "Chinese herb nephrotoxicity syndrome" was later reported in other countries, including the United States.<br><br>A survey in Brussels has identified almost 100 patients who have suffered progressive or sub-acute kidney breakdown, a third of whom has already undergone a transplant, another on haemo-dialysis and the last third has slow and progressive renal failure.<br><br>Health Canada has warned people not to use any Longdan, Lung Tan Xie Gan or Hua Fo herbal medicine products because they could contain aristolochic acid.<br><br>The FDA warns consumers of a potential risk of severe liver damage associated with the use of kava-containing dietary supplements.<br><br>Kava (Piper methysticum) is a plant indigenous to the South Pacific islands where it is commonly used to prepare a traditional beverage.

            <div class='col-md body'>Asian women risk lives in slimming frenzy<br><br>By Carrie Lee<br><br>HONG KONG (Reuters) - A slimming craze is sweeping across Asia, where some women's desire for ever thinner bodies has already cost them their lives.<br><br>In Japan, five people have died and more than 500 have fallen ill after taking diet pills made in China. In Singapore, a slimming product, also from China, was linked to sickness in at least a dozen women and one death.<br><br>Despite the dangers, newspapers, magazines, televisions and billboards across the region are flooded with advertisements for slimming centres that guarantee weight loss in days without dieting or exercise.<br><br>"Most of the people who buy diet products don't appear to be overweight," said Kenichi Naoi, whose family owns a drugstore in central Tokyo that stocks several imported diet aids.<br><br>"But when you see models on television and in magazines, they are so thin. Their bodies appear to be becoming the standard."<br><br>That standard may be virtually unattainable, and unhealthy.<br><br>"Definitely, appearances count. And the slimmer you are, the more cool you look," said a 30-year-old office worker in Tokyo, who identified herself as Yoshie. "Especially for women."<br><br>SOCIAL PRESSURE<br><br>In Singapore, waif-like women stroll around shopping malls in trendy clothes suggesting they are parading their looks rather than just shopping.<br><br>Young women can often be heard complaining to their friends about putting on weight. The Singaporean man's preference for svelte beauties has only added to the problem.<br><br>"They like their women slim," said Manoj Sharma, a 29-year-old marketing communications director in Singapore.<br><br>In India, leading Bombay cosmetic surgeon Vijay Sharma, whose client list includes top Bollywood stars, says that business is booming.<br><br>"I'm seeing a phenomenal growth in Indian men and women opting for different procedures to look thin and beautiful," said Sharma. "With globalisation and media hype, people are pressurised to maintain a great figure," Sharma said.<br><br>Former Miss World Yukta Mookhey, 23, who won her title three years ago, says there's too much emphasis on staying thin.<br><br>"Dieting too much kills you from inside," said Mookhey, who said the constant effort to stay slim left her weak, frustrated and miserable.<br><br>Worse still, many slimmers shun exercise and appropriate diet control, resorting instead to pills and other quick fixes.<br><br>"To drink something, and not have to do anything else, like cutting back on food or getting exercise, and still lose weight -- well, it was really nice," said Yoshie in Tokyo, who used to take Chinese diet pills.<br><br>But slimming pills and schemes don't come cheap. Yoshie paid 3,000 yen (US$25.73) for a bottle of 120 pills.<br><br>In Hong Kong, one slimming centre charges HK$8,000-30,000 (US$1,026-3,846) for a course lasting from four to six weeks.<br><br>LETHARGY, NAUSEA<br><br>While Yoshie lost weight rapidly, she soon became lethargic and felt nauseous to the point where she could not go to work.<br><br>U.S. health officials on Tuesday warned Americans about two potentially deadly Chinese weight-loss pills that may contain fenfluramine, a diet drug pulled from the U.S. market after it was linked to heart problems.<br><br>The Food and Drug Administration said it issued the alert about the Chinese products, Chaso (Jianfei) Diet Capsules and Chaso Genpi, because people had died recently in Japan after using them.<br><br>A number of the products were found to contain fenfluramine, while others contained thyroid hormones.<br><br>In their desire to shed weight, some women have also developed potentially fatal eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia.<br><br>Anorexics, often young women with emotional and social problems, starve themselves, while bulimics are trapped in cycles of bingeing and purging.<br><br>In Singapore, for example, some 45,000 Singaporean women could be suffering from the potentially fatal disorders, according Dr Lee Ee Lian, head of the Eating Disorder Clinic at the Institute of Mental Health.<br><br>Many women are going to slimming clubs that give clients pills to take or put chemicals on their body.<br><br>"Stupid, foolish rich women willing to pay any amount think they can lie down on a couch and lose weight," said Ramma Bans, a leading Indian fitness expert whose proteges have won top beauty pageants, including Miss Universe and Miss World.<br><br>Bans, who has been a fitness trainer for over 40 years, said that nearly every day she had a string of clients who had suffered side-effects from various quick-fix dieting methods.<br><br>"Frauds and scamsters are having a field day," she said.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How safe is your chicken rice?<br>Fast turnover at chicken rice outlets means that harmful bacteria that cause food poisoning have less time to multiply<br><br>By Magdalene Lum<br><br>HUNDREDS of chickens hang in food stalls around Singapore in the heat of day.<br><br>And you can get food poisoning from the main ingredient of Singapore's most popular dish as easily as you can from any food left out too long.<br><br>'This is because bacteria multiplies at room temperature,' warns Dr Chua Sin-Bin, the deputy chief executive officer of the Agri-Food &amp; Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA).<br><br>'Bacteria can double within 20 to 30 minutes. In four hours, you can be looking at 12 generations of bacteria.'<br><br>Dr Chua, who is also the AVA's Director of Food &amp; Veterinary Administration and the man behind food safety in Singapore, says chicken rice lovers should patronise reputable outlets that have a 'fast turnover'.<br><br>Most outlets claim that they sell out their chicken in 45 minutes to two hours - though not all do. (See story below)<br><br>The two most common bacteria found in chicken are salmonella and campylobactea.<br><br>Another is staphyloccus aureus which is found on human skin and hair as well as on chicken skin. It can be passed to the chicken when a hawker squeezes his pimples, scratches his head, picks his nose or has an infected cut on his hand while on the job.<br><br>Last year, there were 1,256 cases of food poisoning here, compared with 986 cases in 1998. Of these, 28 were linked to chicken rice.<br><br>No chicken rice-related food poisoning cases have been reported this year but Dr Chua says people should not let their guard down.<br><br>A person usually feels the symptoms of food poisoning two hours after eating contaminated chicken.<br><br>'You'll feel unwell and nauseous, and vomit. You may have headaches, suffer from abdominal cramps, retch and feel chilly without having a fever,' he says.<br><br>It takes a day to recover from such food poisoning and it is rarely fatal.<br><br>Cooking kills all bacteria including the staphyloccus aureus. But poor hygiene and handling can lead to cross-contamination.<br><br>For instance, if a food handler or housewife, who prepares cooked food, also handles raw chicken or other raw meat at the same time, bacteria in the raw food can contaminate the cooked food, he points out.<br><br>'As a principle, when you handle raw chicken or meat, you should not handle cooked food,' Dr Chua says.<br><br>People should either use different cutting boards for raw and cooked meats, or wash the cutting board and knives thoroughly before switching from raw to cooked foods or vice versa.<br><br>He says the United States has about 80 times more cases of food poisoning than Singapore while New Zealand has 10 times more.<br><br>Despite this, he urges people not to become complacent: 'Everyone must do his or her part to make Singapore not only a food paradise, but a very safe one.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>COMMON PRACTICE<br><br>CHICKEN rice stall holder at a Marine Terrace kopitiam, who wants to be known only as Mr Lai, says he sells 10 to 20 chickens daily.<br><br>And he admits that he lets chicken hang at his stall for up to three hours.<br><br>Otherwise, a random survey of more than 10 chicken rice stalls, restaurants and chains showed that most claim to sell out their chicken in 45 minutes to two hours.<br><br>The Mandarin Singapore's Chatterbox Coffee House serves 250 chickens per day to more than 700 customers.<br><br>''Our chefs cook and replenish the chicken seven or eight times a day to ensure freshness. They chop up only 20 to 30 chicken each time,'' says Ms Renee Lim, the hotel's marketing communications manager.<br><br>And she says each batch sells out in one to 1 1/2 hours.<br><br>Mr David Mah, who manages Boon Tong Kee in Balestier Road, says that his outlet has 300 to 400 customers daily and he sells 120 Hainanese chicken a day.<br><br>''We cook the chicken six to seven times a day, each time cooking 25 of them,'' he says.<br><br>''We do not hang the chicken in the open for longer than two hours.''<br><br>The Five Star Restaurant chain sells 90 chickens daily at each of its three outlets at East Coast Road, River Valley Road and Upper Bukit Timah Road, says Mr Yeo Ban Seng, 50, the proprietor.<br><br>''We cook chicken five to seven times daily, 10 chickens at a time,'' he says, adding that each outlet sells out the 10 chickens within two hours.<br><br>But Mrs Leo Yong, 52, admits business is slow at her stall at a corner shophouse kopitiam at Zion Road.<br><br>She cooks chicken only once a day and sells just four to five per day, taking up to four hours to sell out.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Operators and patrons back bar-top dancing<br>By Lee Hui Chieh<br><br>BAR owners and patrons cannot wait for bar-top dancing to be allowed at nightspots, a possibility they hope will lead to an easing up of the rules governing club behaviour.<br><br>Bar operators interviewed want especially an end to their policeman role in ensuring that patrons do not dance suggestively in a manner that can be viewed as 'dirty dancing', or that performers do not 'interact' with club-goers.<br><br>Should bar-top dancing be allowed at nightspots?<br><br>Until then, they applaud Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong for raising the issue of letting club-goers dance on bar counters when he spoke on encouraging creativity in his National Day Rally address on Sunday.<br><br>At the moment, such dancing can bring a fine of up to $10,000 for the bar owner.<br><br>But it is allowed in several top cities.<br><br>Said Mr Clark Martin, 35, who runs pubs China Jump and Ocho: 'I've seen it in four major cities - London, New York, Paris and Madrid, in the past 10 years.<br><br>'It may be wise to allow it so that we can compete with other countries.'<br><br>Regular club-goers, such as engineer Sherryn Oh, 23, feel the present restriction is a fun- killer.<br><br>'When clubbing, you want to let your hair down and have fun. Having restrictions on where you can dance dampens the mood,' she said.<br><br>But one of the 10 people interviewed yesterday gave bar-top dancing the thumbs down.<br><br>Said Miss H. Wong, a 27-year-old advertising manager: 'Usually, only girls dance on bar tops, and it's like a sexual display.'<br><br>So far, five bars have run foul of the law which confines dancing to the dance floor that is 'demarcated by permanent fixtures at least 1 m high'.<br><br>The latest is Devil's Bar in Orchard Parade Hotel, whose case is pending.<br><br>Action against it prompted some readers to write to The Straits Times Forum page last month, saying that the ban was against free spirit and creativity.<br><br>In reply, the police said it was for the patrons' safety, as bar counters were narrow and could 'lead to disorder', especially when the dancers were drunk.<br><br>Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng took the same line on Sunday, when he was asked to respond to PM Goh's comments, after the rally.<br><br>He said: 'There are other patrons in the lounges, and some may not like the idea, or they may be afraid for their safety from any brawls that may arise, for instance.<br><br>'So it's not a simple matter of saying, 'Done.' '<br><br>However, he added that the police were looking into it, with help from the Public Advisory Panel on Licensing, which makes recommendations based on public feedback.<br><br>All the operators interviewed said they would take safety precautions if the rule was changed. They would widen bar tops, install poles or reserve part of the bar tops for dancing only.<br><br>Said Mr Dennis Foo, 48, a co-owner of Devil's Bar: 'Operators are most concerned about customer safety because we are responsible if anything goes wrong.'<br><br>Mr Martin said to ensure greater control, bars could also hire professional dancers or allow bar-top dancing only after certain hours.<br><br>But all the owners feel more is afoot than just bar-top dancing.<br><br>Said Mr Simon Lim, 35, owner of Wong San's group of eight pubs: 'PM Goh is sending a clear message, not so much about dancing but, in the context of his speech, about a relaxation of the rules.'<br><br>Miss Tracy Phillips, marketing manager of Zouk, hopes it would lead to other changes, such as the extension of opening hours to 4 am or later during festive seasons.<br><br>At the moment, nightspots have to close by 3 am.<br><br>But Mr Foo feels the best move is for the Government to avoid micro-managing the industry.<br><br>He said: 'In the spirit of remaking Singapore, the Government should just lay down the 'no-no' parameters, and leave the rest to the operators for a more laissez-faire approach.'<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pop Star Leaves Hong Kong Limelight<br>By The Associated Press<br><br>HONG KONG (AP)--Complaining that that paparazzi are overwhelming him, pop singer Nicholas Tse said he'll leave Hong Kong to take a break from the limelight.<br><br>The 22-year-old singer wouldn't say where he'll go or how long he'll stay away. But he said Sunday he'll be back in Hong Kong to stand trial beginning Sept. 19 on charges of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice after a car crash involving his Ferrari.<br><br>``For how long, I really don't know. Maybe half year, maybe one year, maybe I might never ever come back again,'' said the singer.<br><br>Tse, who previously has griped about the pressures of stardom, said he hoped Hong Kong's feisty media would ``grow up'' with him during the break.<br><br>The media's attention has shifted away from Tse's albums, movies and love affairs since Hong Kong's anti-graft commission alleged he was involved in a conspiracy to cover up his involvement in a car accident.<br><br>Tse is suspected of having his chauffeur persuade police to let him to stand in as the driver of the car after the March crash. He's pleaded innocent.<br><br>Tse's lawyer said he was slightly injured in early June when he was hit on the head by photographers trying to get his picture outside a court appearance. The lawyer did not elaborate.<br><br>Later that month, Tse suffered head injuries after his car slammed into the back of another vehicle on a highway near Hong Kong's airport. Two weeks later, a photographer with a Hong Kong tabloid magazine accused Tse of bruising his nose and elbow in a scuffle at a Taiwan restaurant.<br><br></div>
