            <div class='col-md body'>The son of Osama bin Laden, Omar, 28 years old, has written a book about his father, which is named "Growing up Bin Laden" and comes out in September of this year. He said in this book, that his father hated his whole family, has forbidden him to own toys,  has taken away his beloved dogs and has killed them by poisonios gas. Later on he has also known of some terror-attacks of Bin Laden. Therfore he left his father and the Al-Kaida-training-camp in Afghanistan in the year 2000, because he do not want to get into connection wth the terror-activities of his father. He also wrote in his book, that Bin Laden was nearly caught by the US. soldiers. But his father could fly in time out of his hideing-place, because of a warning by a secret message.</div>

              <p>“A dog can be owned for purposes such as the following: <br><br>1. A trained dog for hunting. Remember in Islam we are only allowed to hunt for food; there is no such thing as hunting for fun, for we are not allowed to kill or torture animals or drive them out of their habitats for the fun of it. <br><br>2. A trained dog as a guide. This would be the case if a person is blind and he/she has no choice but to keep a dog for essential services. In this case, it is permissible for him/her to keep a dog inside the house once it has been trained for service, but it is still recommended that the dog have its own sleeping arrangement. <br><br>3. A dog trained for police duties. <br><br>4. A guard dog to guard houses or property. <br><br>5. A dog used by farmers to shepherd cattle and sheep. <br></p>
