When I attended it 3yrs back, he was conducting this so called "Super Teen Camp" with his mentor Ernest Wong, but think they are not partners anymore. Think its quite BS what he says, about being the one and letting down the millions of your "brothers and sisters" die when you were conceived. And he threw his glass to break trying to get people to cry, but yeah one of my friends the bochup type started laughing, then he was chased out.Haha...Motivation wise, not much actually.Everyone was psyched up but ended up wasting alot of time doing those "Spider-Webs".</div>
