Hah....think u have to be more responsible for ur own actions loser. It was just between me and firewire but u had to get involved so now it's my fault? Bottom-line is u stooped that low. "and do remember<br>i dun give punches nor do i start them<br>i return them" &lt;---- oh this line is so funny...i wonder if i went for u in the first place...sorry that things were too much for u to take.<br><br>and is it everyone's rights to be respected? Mebbe that's ur dumb view but to me, respect has to be earned. so if u see some able-bodied beggar sitting at the roadside u'd give him ur respect? Get real!<br><br>ooh so u really like this forum and everyone has to say pleasant stuff eh? u think u live in pleasantville eh? I didn't say only people with astounding maturity can post their views....but if ur view sucks, anyone can take it to the mattresses. Got a prob there? scared of getting criticisms? well take a hike then. loser....</div>
