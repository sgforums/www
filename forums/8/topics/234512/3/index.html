We planned to meet at a pub for a drink. I spent the afternoon shopping with the girls and I thought it might have been my fault because I was a bit later than I promised, but he didn't say anything much about it. The conversation was very slow going so I thought we should go off somewhere more intimate so we could talk a bit more privately. We went to this restaurant and he was STILL acting a bit funny. I tried to cheer him up and started to wonder whether it was me or something else. I asked him, and he said no.<br><br>But I wasn't really sure. So anyway, in the car on the way back<br>home, I said that I loved him deeply and he just put his arm around me. I didn't know what the hell that meant because you know, he didn't say it back or anything, this is really worrying me.<br><br>We finally got back home and I was wondering if he was going to leave me! So I tried to get him to talk but he just switched on the TV, and sat with a distant look in his eyes that seemed to say it's all over between us.<br><br>Reluctantly, I said I was going to go to bed. Then after about 10 minutes, he joined me and to my surprise, he responded to my<br>advances. But, he still seemed really distracted, so afterwards I just wanted to confront him but I just cried myself to sleep. I just don't know what to do anymore. I mean, I really think he's seeing someone else and that my life is a disaster.<br><br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br><br><span style="color: blue;">His Side of the Story:</span><br>================<br><br>Nabei!

I thought that was pretty good.</div></blockquote>Deng Xiaoping is visiting the US.  Tired of being shadowed by his entourage at all times, he decides to go for a walk on his own.  This alarms his translators and bodyguards who fear that Mr. Deng will get into trouble since he does not speak any English.  However, realizing that they cannot change his mind, they decide to at least prepare him in case he gets stopped by the police.  "If you get stopped", they coached him, "they'll first ask for your surname and then they'll ask for your given name.  Just tell them and everything will be fine".  So Mr. Deng goes out and enjoys himself.  A policeman recognizes him.  Having heard that Mr. Deng prides himself  in his knowledge of American history, he decides to start a conversation with an appropriate subject.<br>Policeman:   	Who was the first president of the U.S?<br><br>Mr. Deng:    	Wo xing Deng [我姓鄧: My surname is Deng]<br><br>Policeman:    	Yes, Washington.  And what are you doing in the U.S?<br><br>Mr. Deng:    	Xiaoping [小平]<br><br>Policeman:    	Ah, shopping.  Very good.  Have nice day!.</div>
