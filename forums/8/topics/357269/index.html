              <p>Great answers. Lately i have discovered it's much better to not really let noisy neighbours make you angry, because i get headaches after i tell them off. So even though they shut it, i still suffer from a bleeding headache at the end of it. So now adays i go out. And i express my discontent by being "diplomatically nice," sometimes the neighbours get the sarcasm but most of the time it goes over their head, but its much better than blowing up in anger.</p>
              <p>For other people going through the same problems i would advise that. THis rings a bell to those that said use "neigbourly love" although my love would be sarcastic.</p>
              <p>About the usage of Wog, it used to be a phrase for "western orientalized gentleman," what you might call "geh angmoh" when we found it laughable how non Europeans adopted our practices and clothing and style etc etc. That was in the colonial era.

              <p>Today it could be used to refer to peoples who are dark skinned. But not necessarily. It all depends on context. In britain long ago, we called the French wogs, then the Indians, Poles and now the Middle Easterners and Muslim Britains (although it is not allowed today; hence why Asia seems to be the place where there is no constitutional ban on the insult).

              <p>But I use it for anyone who behaves like a twat regardless of skin colour, it has the added benefit of not being understood as a recognized slur in Singapore.</p>

              <p>Great answers. Lately i have discovered it's much better to not really let noisy neighbours make you angry, because i get headaches after i tell them off. So even though they shut it, i still suffer from a bleeding headache at the end of it. So now adays i go out. And i express my discontent by being "diplomatically nice," sometimes the neighbours get the sarcasm but most of the time it goes over their head, but its much better than blowing up in anger.</p>

              <p>But some neighbours were just too dense to even know you were being sarcastic to them and your sarcasm would become pointless and backfired.  So, in order for them to feel your wrath you have to speak their lingo to get your point across.</p>
              <p>I mean like your neighbours, if they are bunch of hokkien 'ping' you don't speak to them in proper comprehensible English as they wouldn't understand you or worse think that you are trying to show off your powerful language. So, you just do it the Singaporean way, :- "KNNBCCB! CHA! CHA! CHA simi lanjiao!" Crude? Yes! But definitely more effective.</p>

              <p>I think we have some great solutions here, so i will just sum it all up in my post.</p>
              <p>1) Blast them back with EMO music, make sure ur speakers can tahan and is louder than theirs.</p>
              <p>2) Buy a bigger/louder dog, make sure ur dog barks,whine,yip, whatever sounds it makes, is louder than ur neighbours' dogs.</p>
              <p>3) Combine ur speakers blasting music together with your dog singing nonstop. (Use with caution,u might collapse before they do)</p>
              <p>4)Call mata if above 3 points doesnt works. (Last resort, since things could get ugly after mata comes.</p>
