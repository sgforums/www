I was there when a friend of mine bought a new handphone at ah beng HP shop in Toa Payoh, shop name is CITYHUB. After my friend decided to buy the phone, the ah beng keep pestering, psychoing my friend to buy those accessories(desktop, batteries etc) in his bengish fwen fwen manner until my friend buay tahan so he pay for it also.<br><br>After paying, the ah beng's true colour shows. He say tomorrow then come collect the spare battery that my friend bought cause now no stock. My friend kpkb but the ah beng insisted he reminded my friend there's no stock even before payment was made. Stupid excuse. Who would pay for something when there isn't any stock.<br><br>So it turned into a heated argument. We demanded they refund or we'll lodge a complain to relevant body. Magically, he somehow manage to produce the spare battery out of nowhere, after insisting there's no stock for some 5 minutes. We questioned the integrity of the spare battery, why he say there's no stock but now he can produce it, whether is it 2nd hand etc. He insisted its new and somehow "prove" it to us by talking lots of cock and showing us many batteries.<br><br>At the moment we're already damn fedup and just left. Before we left, we told him we won't hesistate to lodge a complain if the items prove to be defective. He replied in bengishly like want to fight tone "I don't cheat one, don't you anyhow say. If got problem go ahead come find me lah. My name is Steven."<br><br>A bad day really. Luckily the handphone turns out fine. If want to buy handphone, safer to pay more at established dealers like Singtel, Nokia etc then risk at those neighbourhood ah beng shop. In any case, avoid Cityhub Toa Payoh, and the lao beng who calls himself Steven.</div>

Those small shops think of ways to maximise profits so unless you very good fren or got connection, best to avoid cuz they see ppl eat one. Dun be easily fooled by the lower price they quote cuz in the end you may even pay more than what you get at establised dealers.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Look for fireice lah she got lobang and connection.

I just sent my T610 for firmware upgrading and servicing FOC (under warranty).
