            <div class='col-md body'>Guys, do you all have a particular handphone shop that you always frequent whenever you upgrade your phone?<br><br>For me, I always scout around for the lowest price.  It seems that prices vary quite a lot from shop to shop.<br><br>I'm buying a Samsung E600C phone today, and will be scouting around for the lowest price. The lowest price I found out is $5++ without contract.<br><br>Can anyone tell me their favourite shop's name(s) so that I can find out why the shop(s) is/are their favourite?<br><br>Thank you!<br><br>p/s - in case you were not aware, all I want to ask is, "where can I buy this E600C at the lowest price?". Had to disguise this question in case questions like this are not allowed  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Had to disguise this question in case questions like this are not allowed  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </div></blockquote>Be careful, the price that they quoted you without contract is usually exclusive of GST. Wait till you see the real price that you will be paying for the phone with GST. Better check with them first...a lot of dishonest deals around in sg nowadays.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When scouting for prices, I always assume the price they quote is exclusive of GST. When this price is not the lowest, no need to ask whether GST is included or not.<br><br>Also, some of the shops may sell you the incomplete package - they make you pay for the items that are supposed to be included.<br><br>Then there is the risk of buying recon phones, but i guess the risk is mitigated when we buy the latest model.</div>
