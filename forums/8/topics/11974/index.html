            <div class='col-md body'><br>The bare facts of life in reality in a country like Singapore  - Chung Cher Shen<br><br>The world or rather should I say life is filled with much dilemma. Everyday we make decisions that affect us in somehow or another way. We may not know it or even be aware until we are actually scalded by the consequences of the actions that we undertook. Many of the times, our loved ones are suffering and accepting our faults as we are<br><br>The reason of the topic, Preference Vs prudence is to highlight the dilemma of the many choices that we are being endowed upon in a very privileged country like Singapore. First of all let me introduce myself. I am a 21 year old and an very inexperienced person who knows basically nothing about the outside grapevined Shenton way in Singapore. The tough Army life have however toughened me for any negative harsh dog-eat-dog world so I guess I am able to handle any human-made turbulence when I am shown the reality of working world. I guess thatÂ’s the many benefits of spending your 2.5 prime life in Singapore protecting the country<br><br>For those who are in the working force, I am sure that the toll is taking on you everyday when you return back from work. At the end of the day when you are returning from work the first thing that comes into your mind will be u am sure a hot steaming bath and a sumptuous dinner prepared by your loved ones on the dinner table waiting for you. However this may not always be the case for all families because in reality this ideal home scenarios are like for the minority whom has the envy of full time mother s and housewives ensuring that the children and husband get their pampered care. However in Singapore where women are more educated and large number are holding senior positions in top companies, it is hare to find that such ideal wife really do exist. But dunt get me wrong here I am not a sexist. ItÂ’s just another valid point of the article that I am making .  As a result in Singapore, food courts are making a thriving business here cos the majority of Singaporeans eat out.<br><br>For those who are young in heart and prefer to relax out at the pub namely the more popular ones at Mohamad Sultan and Boat Quay (nobody seems  to like to go to Clarke Quay, I wonder why).<br><br>Teenage girls freak out at the mention if Sale going on at major shopping centres and branded goods give the creeps out of any potential suitors these girls have. Boys at the mention that their idols from Taiwan and Hongkong rush to get the tickets without even their eyes twitching at the mention of the price ticket. Such is the sign of rich kids in rich countries<br><br></div>
