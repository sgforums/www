            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">by Lau Cheow</span><br><br>After the impressive showing of ex-Chinese sportsmen and sportswomen for Singapore at the recently concluded SEA Games in Hanoi, China has officially asked Singapore to accept more Chinese athletes, in effect, providing China with an official presence in South-East Asian sports.<br><br>As nearly two-thirds of the athletes winning gold medals were originally from China, this move makes perfect sense, and is seen to be a strong signal that China is taking the SEA Games seriously as it gears up for its own Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008.<br><br>The Chairman of the Chinese Olympic Federation, Mr. Yao Yun Dong said that it worked to China's favour in several ways. The SEA Games can be used as practice venues for her own athletes who can train in Singapore. Sporting exchanges have always been an important feature of Chinese diplomacy, added Mr. Yao, pointing out that it was ping-pong diplomacy that led to the easing of ties between the US and China in the 1970s.<br><br>"However, more importantly, " said Mr Yao, "this move allows us to send our second and third-rate athletes to gain experience in sporting events and win some medals, otherwise they'd be demoralised if they were to stay in China and not get selected for the national team."<br><br>Speaking for the Singapore National Olympic Council, newly elected adviser, Mr. Chong Guo Ren said that Singapore would be delighted to accommodate China's wishes, as it opens the door to more sporting exchanges in future.<br><br>"We see Singapore and the SEA Games as stepping stones to greater things, like the Olympic Games," declared Mr Chong, "I'm sure my comrades, uh, fellow Singaporeans, feel the same."<br><br>Meanwhile, Mr. Chong reiterated that locally-born non-imported Singaporeans would still play a vital role in SingaporeÂ’s sports.<br><br>Â“As the development of Newater has shown, Singapore has great skill with water. So IÂ’m sure locals can extend water provision services to competing athletes,Â” said Mr. Chong. Â“Further, I understand local-born Singaporeans have an affinity with ball-lifting activities due to years of civil service exposure. IÂ’m confident these ball-carrying skills will also translate into useful support services for our athletes competing in sports like ping pong, basketball and soccer.Â”<br><br>In a related sports development, the Institute of Sports Medicine and Genetics has announced that it will contribute to Singapore's goals of qualifying for the World Cup and winning a gold medal at the Olympics by using cloning technology to breed pigs with wings.<br><br>from <a href="http://www.talkingcock.com" rel="nofollow">www.talkingcock.com</a></div>
