            <div class='col-md body'>From:  facial   02:29<br>To:  tomhunk88   29 of 30<br><br>71707.29 in reply to 71707.1<br><br>JW extension has a surplus of 3200 units of flats built more than 4 yreas ago and still vacant. I think they clear about 1000 units during the last walk-in excercise and are trying desparately to get rid of the remaining 2000 over units.<br><br>There was even a proposal for private developers to take over these surplus units and turn it into private residential or premium hostel for NTU's student's and staff but no developer in their right frame of mind took up the offer.<br><br>I lived in JW Ext (St.91)  for 5 yrs but have since moved out a yr ago.<br><br>I took a big hit getting rid of my 5 room flat but I am glad I got out of that place. Briefly, here are the main downside:<br><br>1. Noise pollution. Damn bloody jet planes are practicing as early as 7 am during the mth preceding to National Day and end as late as 10 pm sometimes. The roar is deafening!!!<br><br>2. A hassle to get to city area. By public transport, u need feeder bus and all that. By private, your petrol will burn a hole in your pocket.<br><br>3. If you have kids, you will have a hard time finding a good school. If you hang around Jurong Point and observe the behaviour of the students from the neighbourhood schools there, you will know what I mean. A lot of "mud rocks"...<br><br>4. As for air pollution, the cocoa smell happens once every 2 or 3 days but you will get use to it.<br><br>5. Huge population of foreign workers in that vacinity because there are a few huge foreign workers quarters there. Come weekends, they will swamp Jurong Point lke ants. Also, you will find plenty of them drinking into the wee hours at the 24 hrs coffeeshop.<br><br>In a nutshell, stay away from that estate.<br><br></div>

My wife stays in the west, while I stay in the central area. I die die also dowan Jurong West flats due to the air pollution from Jurong Island and noise pollution from Tengah Air Base. Besides, Jurong West is such a long distance from the city, even driving there also si beh sian.<br><br>Why Mabok Tan said all these is because it's a fact that Jurong West flats nobody want. Even the 4 and 5 room flats are selling very much cheaper compared to other areas.<br><br>2) If i want to sell next time say either a 4/5 room, will i be able to make a profit?<br><br>Profit ? If you dun suffer any lose, you can "thank heaven thank earth" already.<br><br>By the way, do not rush into getting a flat. Look around at other areas<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tomhunk:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi, last sat hdb offers 2000 units of 4/5 room flats all selling below 200K...they even offer premium flats..ready to move in, tiling all done ..on living room, bedroom, toilet and kitchen all selling below 200 k.Surrounding amenities not much except a sports complex being built and a proposed mrt line...I got a few questions:<br><br>1) What do you think of Jurong West ? marbolro tan said that they will be building an mrt line beyond boon lay station to serve the area.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">There are a lot of existing HDB flats in Jurong West (near Jurong Point) vacant. Kinda like ghost town. Of course HDB has to sell cheap, to cut lost!<br>Renov of flats are cheap compared to the selling price. So HDB do it up to entice folks to buy.</span><br><br>2) If i want to sell next time say either a 4/5 room, will i be able to make a profit?<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Even if you buy brand new from HDB at cheap price, there's no telling that you can sell at a profit later, esp in this current market. It lacks amenities, near industrial park, no good schools, far from city, you tell me if you can make a profit? Unless, there's news of upgrading for the estate and more amenities are provided. You shouldn't buy JW unless you work in the West.</span>I would sugg you get a more centralised area, say Toa Payoh, Bishan or Ang Mo Kio. Altho more expensive but much worth it then JW.<br><br>3) Y are the flats cheap in comparision to other ulu places like seng kang..interestingly a 4/5 room at sengkang cost 300k instead?<br><br><span style="color: blue;">[color=cyan]If you are comparing new flats with resale flats, then it's not a fair comparison. Resale flats, altho older, would be more expensive than new flats from HDB in general as it's following market rate.</span><br><br>4) People say JW not a good place to live in, difficult to sell ? Any of thr bros here have real life story to share..<br><br><span style="color: blue;">JW is not as bad as Sengkang in terms of selling flats. JW is more mature while Sengkang is not really that mature, so lacking a lot of amenities. Lots of flats selling in Sengkang, hence a lot of flats chasing after a small number of buyers, harder to sell. JW's flat selling condition is not so bad.</span><br><br>many thanks<br><br></div></blockquote></div>
