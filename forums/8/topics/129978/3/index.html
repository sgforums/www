            <div class='col-md body'>From:  orwell76   04:07<br>To:  KUATIOGUI (Sed83)   34 of 37<br><br>71707.34 in reply to 71707.20<br><br>If you work in Jurong Island or Tuas, you can consider purchasing a 4/5rm in the area. I am working in Jurong Island and I recently purchase a 4room flat in Jurong West St91. The floor area is 103m2. I got the flat at 125k. The only reason that I bought this flat is that I do not need to take a loan to service the mortgage as I have just enough in my CPF to clear it one shot.<br><br>However, there are several points you might to consider.<br><br>Air pollution: As the petrochemical plants do soot blowing at night the air quality is very bad in the area, as the soot is carry over by crosswind. The flat is always dusty no matter how much cleaning you do. So most of the time I shut all my windows.<br><br>Is rather inconvinient to travel to town area. The area is heavily populated. The feeder bus queue is always very long. Most of the time my family takes a cab to and fro from town.<br><br>A recent Newpaper article highlight the presence of drug pushers at the Boon Lay interchange. So you might want to take note of this.<br><br>There are also daily overhead flights of RSAF jet fighters.<br><br>Foreign nationals tend to congregate in the NanYang CC area on the weekends.<br><br>Jurong Piont shopping mall is crowded. The nearest UOB is at Boon Lay way. The POSB/DBS atm queue is always very long. So you might consider opening an OCBC bank account.<br><br>So think over the above mentioned carefully.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yep, unless you're talking about the Bukit Timah stretch of good schools then okay lah....<br><br>If you want to have a good location for all levels of education, try the Dover area, got good Primary school, good secondary school, decent and happening JC, otherwise Poly also nearby, if not ITE also around the corner.

I opted for a 4-room flat in Toa Payoh. As the floor area is as little as 86 m2, I believe not many people will take it. My wife and I dun mind though. However, when I summitted the application personally, the counter girl told me that out of 63 units, only about 10 is chinese eligible, and the status then was more than 400 applications received.<br><br>Even though we have first priority because we are first timer, and will be staying close to parents, however we know it will not be easy. Nevertheless, we dowan to let this chance slip by.<br><br>After I submmitted the application, I logged into the HDB website regularly to look at the updated numbers of application received. I was totally disheartened when the application received reached 800. As expected, I really failed in the balloting despite having those priorities. I wonder how come still got so many people apply. sigh...<br><br>Anyway, now I am looking at resale flats. As I said before, please do not consider Jurong West. Even though they are indeed very cheap, just think of the inconvenience and pollution. Furthermore, by the time the MRT extension from Boon Lay MRT station is ready, it will be 5 years time and your are able to sell your Jurong West flat.<br><br>Let's wish each other good luck in our search of our new flat though.

What I found out is most companies meet strict standards when come to emissions. I don't think I'd worry about pollutants. As for soot blowing, I have to say that depends on the wind. There were several incidents of bad soot discharge from companies, however complaints received were from residents in West Coast, Teban Gdns and Clementi who got their clothes blackened.those estates mentioned above are closer than JW to jurong island.<br><br>Another thing is, it would surprise you if I say the most polluted land in sg is in the east. Somehow this was the result of a study made years back. It seems that most industries are very compliant, spending millions to ensure their discharge are within spec. They have no choice because the fines are huge. However you can't say the same for vehicles on expressways, ships anchoring off the east coast and jets using changi airport.<br><br>FTs: this is one negative part. Their hostels are here. FTs would usually hang around the foot of JW blocks to drink. You wouldnt want your daughters or wives to come back late alone. better complain to cedric white-horse fool to do something here.<br><br>schools: no good schools here<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agreed. Good analysis. very comforting since I have chosen JW to be my home.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tomhunk:</div><div class="quote_body">From:  the lamp (digitaltable)   08:03<br>To:  tomhunk88   52 of 54<br><br>71707.52 in reply to 71707.46<br><br>here's my lowdown on JW ext:<br><br>sports complex: its one of the biggest i've seen in sg.<br>if you go up the old blocks opposite the caltex petrol station, you will see what i mean. the olympic size pool is visible but full of rainwater. i think there's also an indoor pool. the complex itself still under construction but already reach level 7 of adjacent block.<br><br>transport: the feeder service is very regular for one reason: NTU.<br>just take this bus for your daily commute and u get to enjoy nice views too<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>mrt: i agree u can't trust pap on this.<br><br>shopping: Giant is 10mins away by foot.<br><br>pollution: i used to do consultancy work for companies in Jurong Island to meet NEA standard. What I found out is most companies meet strict standards when come to emissions. I don't think I'd worry about pollutants. As for soot blowing, I have to say that depends on the wind. There were several incidents of bad soot discharge from companies, however complaints received were from residents in West Coast, Teban Gdns and Clementi who got their clothes blackened.those estates mentioned above are closer than JW to jurong island.<br><br>Another thing is, it would surprise you if I say the most polluted land in sg is in the east. Somehow this was the result of a study made years back. It seems that most industries are very compliant, spending millions to ensure their discharge are within spec. They have no choice because the fines are huge. However you can't say the same for vehicles on expressways, ships anchoring off the east coast and jets using changi airport.<br><br>FTs: this is one negative part. Their hostels are here. FTs would usually hang around the foot of JW blocks to drink. You wouldnt want your daughters or wives to come back late alone. better complain to cedric white-horse fool to do something here.<br><br>schools: no good schools here<br><br></div></blockquote></div>
