            <div class='col-md body'>I feel so down recentlyÂ… my girl will be getting married in 4 daysÂ’ time. We know each other for three years even before I get enlisted into the army. I knew her when she was a member of my matchmaking club back then in 2001. But I closed down the business in 2003 when I entered the army, I forsaken each and every single member except for her. Later, we became very close but becos of the damn and bloody N.S that I am serving, I got no choice but to put our relationship on hold. She said she promised to give me time but given my hesitation, she went back to her ex-bf in Jan 2003. In Dec 2003, she wrote me a letter one day and told me that she made the wrong choice. She regretted not waiting for me and wanna came back to me. Again bcos of the f/ucked up N.S, I asked her to wait first but I wasnÂ’t toying with her. She got angry and left again, blaming that I wasnÂ’t serious with her.<br><br>In January 2005, we contacted each other again. She was very happy to hear from me again. I was finishing my N.S in Feb 2005. One more month and we can be together again, after more than 2 yearsÂ…. I donÂ’t want to let her wait anymore. But this time, itÂ’s different. Cos she got a boyfriend, but I am not scared of any guy out there as they donÂ’t pose a threat to me. I donÂ’t give a damn to any guy for I am sure I can thrash them easily with no difficulty. After I saw the guy photo, I knew I will win for sure. He looked like a monkey. Unfortunately, this monkey proposed on 14th Feb 2005 and she agreed to marry him. They are both 23 only. What the bloody problem with girls nowadays? Why did she do it? She is so young. Is she desperate or is the guy afraid of me, knowing that I will come out and get back whatÂ’s rightfully belongs to me? One look and I can tell that the guy is not financially stable. How can she make such a dumb decision and put a full-stop to her future here? I really donÂ’t understand how I can lose to an inferior good?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>I really donÂ’t understand people nowadays. Retarded people are everywhere.. You see them on the trains. You see them on the buses. You can even watch them from the streets. I always help people to get hitched back then with my matchmaking club but I cannot help myselfÂ…. That is probably why people always say that a fortune-teller can never tell his own fortune.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br></div>

I don't think the monkey can give her the life she said she wanted when she was with me then. If the guy is good enough to look after her, I will be happy for her too. But now the wedding can just be her own funeral in disguise.</div>
