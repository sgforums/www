            <div class='col-md body'>1. Guys don't actually go after good-looking girls. They prefer<br>neat and<br>presentable girls.<br><br>2. Guys hate flirts.<br><br>3. A guy can like you for a minute, and then forget you<br>afterwards.<br><br>4. When a guy says he doesn't understand you, it simply means<br>you're not<br>thinking the way he is.<br><br>5. "Are you doing something?" or "Have you eaten already?" are the<br>first<br>usual questions a guy asks on the phone just to get out from<br>stammering.<br><br>6. Guys may be flirting around all day but before they go to<br>sleep, they<br>always think about the girl they truly care about.<br><br>7. When a guy really likes you, he'll disregard all your bad<br>characteristics.<br><br>8. Guys go crazy over a girl's smile.<br><br>9. Guys will do anything just to get the girl's attention.<br><br>10. Guys hate it when you talk about your ex-boyfriend.<br><br>11. When guys want to meet your parents. Let them.<br><br>12. Guys want to tell you many things but they can't. And they<br>sure have<br>one habit to gain courage and spirit to tell you many things and it<br>is<br>drinking!<br><br>13. Guys cry!!!<br><br>14. Don't provoke the guy to heat up. Believe me. He will.<br><br>15. Guys can never dream and hope too much.<br><br>16. Guys usually try hard to get the girl who has dumped them,<br>and this<br>makes it harder for them to accept their defeat.<br><br>17. When you touch a guy's heart, there's no turning back.<br><br>18. Giving a guy a hanging message like "You know<br>what?!..uh...never<br>mind!"<br>would make him jump to a conclusion that is far from what you are<br>thinking.<br><br>19. Guys go crazy when girls touch their hands.<br><br>20. Guys are good flatterers when courting but they usually<br>stammer when<br>they talk to a girl they really like.<br><br>21. When a guy makes a prolonged "umm" or makes any excuses when<br>you're<br>asking him to do you a favor, he's actually saying that he doesn't<br>like you<br>and he can't lay down the card for you.<br><br>22. When a girl says "no", a guy hears it as "try again<br>tomorrow."<br><br>23. You have to tell a guy what you really want before he gets<br>the message<br>clearly.<br><br>24. Guys hate gays!<br><br>25. Guys love their moms.<br><br>26. A guy would sacrifice his money for lunch just to get you a<br>couple of<br>roses.<br><br>27. A guy often thinks about the girl who likes him. But this<br>doesn't mean<br>that the guy likes her.<br><br>28. You can never understand him unless you listen to him.<br><br>29. If a guy tells you he loves you once in a lifetime. He does.<br><br>30. Beware. Guys can make gossips scatter through half of the<br>face of the<br>earth faster than girls can.<br><br>31. Like Eve, girls are guys' weaknesses.<br><br>32. Guys are very open about themselves.<br><br>33. It's good to test a guy first before you believe him. But<br>don't let<br>him<br>wait that long.<br><br>34. No guy is bad when he is courting<br><br>35. Guys hate it when their clothes get dirty. Even a small dot.<br><br>36. Guys really admire girls that they like even if they're not<br>that much<br>pretty.<br><br>37. Your best friend, whom your boyfriend seeks help from about<br>his<br>problems with you may end up being admired by your boyfriend.<br><br>38. If a guy tells you about his problems, he just needs someone<br>to listen<br>to him. You don't need to give advice.<br><br>39. A usual act that proves that the guy likes you is when he<br>teases you.<br><br>40. A guy finds ways to keep you off from linking with someone<br>else.<br><br>41. Guys love girls with brains more than girls in miniskirts.<br><br>42. Guys try to find the stuffed toy a girl wants but would<br>unluckily get<br>the wrong one.<br><br>43. Guys virtually brag about anything.<br><br>44. Guys cannot keep secrets that girls tell them.<br><br>45. Guys think too much.<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'><br>46. Guys' fantasies are unlimited.<br><br>47. Girls' height doesn't really matter to a guy but her weight<br>does!<br><br>48. Guys tend to get serious with their relationship and become<br>too<br>possessive. So watch out girls!!!<br><br>49. When a girl makes the boy suffer during courtship, it would<br>be hard<br>for<br>him to let go of that girl.<br><br>50. It's not easy for a guy to let go of his girlfriend after<br>they broke<br>up<br>especially when they've been together for 3 years or more.<br><br>51. You have to tell a guy what you really want before getting<br>involved<br>with that guy.<br><br>52. A guy has to experience rejection, because if he's<br>too-good-never-been-busted, never been in love and hurt, he won't<br>be<br>matured<br>and grow up.<br><br>53. When an unlikable circumstance comes, guys blame themselves a<br>lot more<br>than girls do. They could even hurt themselves physically.<br><br>54. Guys have strong passion to change but have weak will power.<br><br>55. Guys are tigers in their peer groups but become tamed<br>$#%%#cats with<br>their girlfriends.<br><br>56. When a guy pretends to be calm, check if he's sweating.<br>You'll<br>probably<br>see that he is nervous.<br><br>57. When a guy says he is going crazy about the girl. He really<br>is.<br><br>58. When a guy asks you to leave him alone, he's just actually<br>saying,<br>"Please come and listen to me"<br><br>59. Guys don't really have final decisions.<br><br>60. When a guy loves you, bring out the best in him.<br><br>61. If a guy starts to talk seriously, listen to him.<br><br>62. If a guy has been kept shut or silent, say something.<br><br>63. Guys believe that there's no such thing as love at first<br>sight, but<br>court the girls anyway and then realize at the end that he is<br>wrong.<br><br>64. Guys like femininity not feebleness.<br><br>65. Guys don't like girls who punch harder than they do.<br><br>66. A guy may instantly know if the girl likes him but can never<br>be sure<br>unless the girl tells him.<br><br>67. A guy would waste his time over video games and basketball,<br>the way a<br>girl would do over her romance novels and make-ups.<br><br>68. Guys love girls who can cook or bake.<br><br>69. Guys like girls who are like their moms. No kidding!<br><br>70. A guy has more problems than you can see with your naked<br>eyes.<br><br>71. A guy's friend knows everything about him. Use this to your<br>advantage.<br><br>72. Don't be a snob. Guys may easily give up on the first sign of<br>rejection.<br><br>73. Don't be biased. Try loving a guy without prejudice and<br>you'll be<br>surprised.<br><br>74. Girls who bathe in their eau de perfumes do more repelling<br>than<br>attracting guys.<br><br>75. Guys are more talkative than girls are especially when the<br>topic is<br>about girls.<br><br>76. Guys don't comprehend the statement "Get lost" too well.<br><br>77. Guys really think that girls are strange and have<br>unpredictable<br>decisions but still love them more.<br><br>78. When a guy gives a crooked or pretentious grin at your jokes,<br>he finds<br>them offending and he just tried to be polite.<br><br>79. Guys don't care about how shiny their shoes are unlike girls.<br><br>80. Guys tend to generalize about girls but once they get to know<br>them,<br>they'll realize they're<br>wrong.<br><br>81. Any guy can handle his problems all by his own. He's just too<br>stubborn<br>to deal with it.<br><br>82. Guys find it so objectionable when a girl swears.<br><br>83. Guys' weakest point is at the knee.<br><br>84. When a problem arises, a guy usually keeps himself cool but<br>is already<br>thinking of a way out.<br><br>85. When a guy is conscious of his looks, it shows he is not good<br>at<br>fixing<br>things.<br><br>86. When a guy looks at you, either he's amazed of you or he's<br>criticizing<br>you.<br><br>87. When you catch him cheating on you and he asks for a second<br>chance,<br>give it to him. But when you catch him again and he asks for<br>another<br>chance,<br>ignore him.<br><br>88. If a guy lets you go, he really loves you.<br><br>89. If you have a boyfriend, and your boy best friend always<br>glances at<br>you<br>and it obviously shows that he is jealous whenever you're with your<br>boyfriend, all I can say is your boy best friend loves you more<br>than your<br>boyfriend does.<br><br>90. Guys learn from experience not from the romance books that<br>girls read<br>and take as their basis of experience.<br><br>91. You can tell if a guy is really hurt or in pain when he cries<br>in front<br>of you!<br><br>92. If a guy suddenly asks you for a date, ask him first why.<br><br>93. When a guy says he can't sleep if he doesn't hear your voice<br>even just<br>for one night, hang up. He also tells that to another girl. He only<br>flatters<br>you and sometimes makes fun of you.<br><br>94. You can truly say that a guy has good intentions if you see<br>him<br>praying<br>sometimes.<br><br>95. Guys seek for advice not from a guy but from a girl.<br><br>96. Girls are allowed to touch boys' things. Not their hair!<br><br>97. If a guy says you're beautiful, that guy likes you.<br><br>98. Guys hate girls who overreact.<br><br>99. Guys love you more than you love them if they are serious in<br>your<br>relationships<br></div>
