            <div class='col-md body'>The sun isn't changing in size, nor is the earth.  It gets hotter in the afternoon because that is when the sun is directly overhead.  In the morning, the sun is just reaching over the horizon.  Taking a peep.<br><br>To reinforce this idea, if you have ever taken a flight at high altitude and flying towards a country at sunrise.

Did they ever measure to see their calculations was correct?<br><br>They went into space calculating (estimating) pressure.<br><br>and a small decimal place killed the russian astronauts..<br><br>so whose fault? calculate calculate with theories, Theories may be very close to actual, but is never close enough to become a fact. That is something a scientist should know. A fact is a fact, a theory is not a fact until proven right. You don't prove a theory is a fact by having 100 correct results. You prove a theory is right by having zero errors.<br><br>For example, the half-life theory is never a proven fact to be a correct measure for time. Carbon-14 is the best Scientist could use to estimate. These calculations can be wrong by a 0.1 to the power of 2 billion unpredicatability. That means you're still wrong by a ridiculous small fraction. Still that is a wrong calculation, since in science, near 100% accuracy is never accurate.<br><br>If you're taking your text book around and say it's your bible and everything inside is right, then I feared you never examined and trusted books too simply.<br><br>I don't mean they are wrong, it's just that you can never be 100% sure what they actually told you was 100% correct. A lot of things had been taught, and you should know that scientists constantly manage to prove certain theories are wrong.<br><br>Example: CO2 cover on Earth causing Greenhouse effect and thus increasing the warmth of Earth is still a theory. Some scientist contested this theory with the Age of Vikings when CO2 cover was not a possibilty.<br><br>Once again Newton's Law is a theory.</div>
