            <div class='col-md body'>isn't there like some abused women's hotline that u can call and report spouse abuse? how does ur sis feel about the whole thing? i know some women who though get their ass beat up day in and night out by their husbands but either 1)they too scared 2) dun want divorce because of kids 3)love? their husbands and feel that they deserve it?!?!<br>personally i think reason 1 is more like it but tell ur sis to seek help immediately... wife-beaters are basically cowards at heart man... lock 'em up in jail for a few days and let them get gang-raped by the inmates and see how they feel... its not too late... get help before ur gf's sis might get seriously hurt...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Way to go Bish...<br>Firstly...try to get a grp of Ah bengs to beat him using a gunnysack and put it over his head.Then, maybe if he try to beat up his wife again venting his frustration,bring himm to the police station(Provided that his wife is agreeable)<br><br>I can't stand a man eating a woman.I will make sure he will never see the next sunlight again.Deserve to be shot dead!!But i think in this circumstances,it is best to talk to ur gf sis and see what she say, cos if she din want to do anything about it. I think she might think u are trying to be a KPO, trust me I tried it before but if u a really care for her.The best thing is really frighted him out of his wits that he will never touch her wife brutally anymore.(Threaten to pour concentrated hydrochrloric acid onto his limbs and make sure he can't use it to beat anyone!My way of violence!haha!)<br><br>Who knows he won't be a child abuser, seems that this kind of abuse come in a package.Dun wait before it too late!!<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes it does come in a package...and it passes from one generation to the next generation...Best to find some way to break the circle...I also don't agree with mommas boys...always must listen to parents one...:-(   I'm also a mommas boy..will do things to make my mom happy and listen to what she say, but I make my own decisions...If she ask me to do stupid thing I scold her man...or if she goes overboard I also scold her...can scold my dad also...but I don't do it out of disrespect..parents are still human being after all, and sometimes they also make a lot of stupid mistakes and ask dumb things...  I listen to them and try and make them happy, but never to the extent where it will affect anyone else but me and my parents...:-(<br><br>This is maddening about the beating !!! I detest!!!  U can report him to the police, but unfortunately it is ultimately up to the wife to prosecute or not...and as stated earlier, get her the number for crisis hotline man...That's proabbly the best u can do...<br><br>I believe that U should threaten the shit out of him, but he might take it out on his wife even more afterwards tho...they usually do.  I don't know, i wold do something insidious like keep leaving mysterious notes outside his room or something saying,"I know u beat ur wife.  I am going to make u pay in spade! The more u beat her, the more u will pay!"<br><br>Like keep leaving one...then got psychological terror..it;'s true that these types are ussually cowards like fuck.  If u were to beat his ass, he would probably cry like the wimp that he is...probably keep crying for his mother...mommy mommy...sheesh!!!  Can't stand his type..(women beater)<br><br>Go with the psych tactics...is best...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess the most legal way for you to get it done is to approach the police.... but then again you may consider other unorthordox methods like kidnapping him and getting a real BIG sized woman to beat the stuffing outta him! Let him feels what is it like to be 'hum tum' by a woman!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Or put him in a room and blast distorted sounds REAL loud into his damn ears! Or just "pontong" his manhood... Pontong 1 inch off it everytime he beats his wife <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>But seriously the most legal way is to approach the police... of course a lot still depends on the wife lah!<br><br>------------------<br>Why?

            <div class='col-md body'>Rinoa:<br>I tot u should know whether I can approach the sister anot.<br><br>But anyway, from what I know of, the dad had stepped in, so a police report had been filed. But the wife can be soft-hearted. Some more must fight for the custody of the daughter(newborn). I believe the father wanted to fight for the daughter too. I believe that the judge would not give the custody to a wife-beater if it gone to the court case. F**king muz put his pix on the newspaper BIG BIG. Let his f**king business failed!!<br><br>You can call me a pyscho but if I can take revenge, I will darn make the son go and f**k the mother in front of the father. Then castrate him and then inject all those female hormones into him. Everyday torture him physically and psychologically. For the mother, probably be kind-hearted, just make her lives in living hell, that is better of dead!<br><br>Anyway, my gf's dad is quite a stubborn and wierd-thinking fellow. I dun like him but this time, it is really good to have the dad around. The dad's stubborness comes into usefulness. Hope he can stop her from going back. This is not the first time he beats her. I think it already happened way before their marriage. Somemore think that having a child would solve the marriage problem but... he did "PROMISE" not to beat her but I think everytime he still does.<br><br>But the most thing he could say is "if don't use my hands, how about other things?". That is only what a true mother-f**ker SOB can say. I'm too pissed for kind words....<br><br>Impact of physical pain is not as great as that of psychological pain. Rinoa should know better.

            <div class='col-md body'>Bish...<br>First...So they are filing for divorce papers.Which means ur gf sis agreed to leave that creep.Good!!So in the meantime, just in case she changes her mind, get someone who is really close to her to stay in her house so that jerk won't try to psyco her to maybe not try to charge him with anything.<br><br>And if u really want to teach that parasite a lesson without him pressing charges against u.I think I have a few choices for u.<br><br>1.Get someone to follow him for a week to let him know that someone is following him.Let him get real paraniod.<br><br>2.When he realised that someone is following him, he might think that ur gf sis has sent someone to beat up.So he will try to stay more often at home and hopefully gf sis is not staying with him anymore.<br><br>3.I dunno how u gonna to do this, but just send someone to pretend to pour acid on him but it is actually water lah!Try to really frighten him...but after the whole ordeal, then the "assassin" HP rings, then he says:"Oh! I see...You want me to castrate him...or u want me to chop off his limbs??"I tell u, he will be real terrified.Then, the assaissin will say:"Ok, I will monitor him for the next few months!If he is still trying to beat up woman, I will make sure he PAYS for it.Anyway, I have connections in the police-force and they will support me in castrating this SOB!"And he will end with a very evil smile..Hahaha!<br><br>Of cos, this is only a suggestion to really get into his psychology nerves.But sure takes lots of effort and time.Must get those that big-sized and speak Hokkien and with lotsa tatoos.I think give him a few tight slaps first is able to suffice...See if this works...<br><br>ehh...try to get opinions from others first...I dun want u to screw up<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think in this case violence against him is the best solution. He can get some other hokkien speaking ah beng to help him or he might try some other equally wierd thing that we can think of.<br><br>Perhaps the best thing to do now is to make sure she doesn't get hurt again. Good that a police report has been filed. The next step is to make her understand that there are people willing to help her and stand up for her or take care of her if she splits up. Not the husbands family of course, because from what you said they appear to be pretty screwed up.<br><br>Bring in a child into the picture and it gets even more complicated. I can imagine that a wife who loved her husband (yes, even one that beat her up) might want to give him a second chance. If thats her decision, so be it. The people around her then can only watch her back and offer more support. The best thing that could occur would be that he mend his ways and a family need not break up.<br><br>But the next time same thing happens, show no face and bring out the big guns. Prosecute, charge, counsel, everything. When he doesn't play by the rules doesn't mean you should do the same thing.<br><br>[This message has been edited by pacman (edited 24-11-1999).]</div>
