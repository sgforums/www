              <p>I recently made a documentary about how patriotic I am.. (as if only)</p>
              <p>So I decided to interview some uncles on the nearby blocks and see what is their reaction.. surprisingly they accepted my interview! (after countless times of trying) I thought all singaporeans are shy and don't dare to get interviewed..</p>
              <p>I apologize if my videography is very lousy, still an amateur on camera. Just want to ask you all what do you think about my video?</p>
              <p>If you find it sian then its ok.. but do comment on my mistakes I have committed so I can correct them <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>However if you find it good, do click like to vote for me! I am not acting here for the sakes of votes, but for the honest reviews.. as this is a forum.</p>
              <p>feel free to criticise or do anything u guys feel like doing </p>

              <p>(1) start between 0.01 - 0.03 the introduction sentences seems not properly centred.</p>
              <p>(2) 0.04 - 0.13 almost 10 seconds of intro frames seems a little too long.  This may keep viewer waiting thinking that its gonna be another boring video when they have not watched on the rest of the clip.</p>
              <p>(3)  0.14 - 0.26 maybe you can zoom in a little closer to the presenter, maybe from waist up instead of cutting the frame at the legs?</p>
              <p>(4)  Ditto between 0.58 - 1.09.  mayb the transitions can rely a little more on camera movement, angle or frames triming instead of relying on the presenter 's movement away from the view?</p>
              <p>(5) interviewers with the uncle and athlete did you use a remote microphone on the subjects? because using a remote  or condenser microphone can cancel out most ambient noises and make the speaker more audible amongt the din.</p>
              <p>(6) the whole clip was it done with  different cam set up or settings? its seems like some of th frames the aspect ratio are differnt from other frames, making it like those old bruce lee films. did you shoot on full HD but  donot have the proper software to render the aspect rations right? To my experrience its either the player or the creation software have no HD handling capabilities.</p>
              <p>(7) the ending credits scenes of surrondin HDB estate and playground was done with slider cam setup, while the beginnign and rest of the films were mostly handheld. maybe som consistency cn be maintained on camera support?</p>
              <p>(8)  its okay but seems like the whole clip is a little dull on the color and lighting exposure. you may want to check your cam setting or if its a camcorder you can select a slower shutter speed since its an interview clip with no fast action and a slower shutter may allow more ambient light. elese check your filiming locations as some areas may be shady and in this case you can use reflector or some basic continuous studio lighting to  bring more shine in your video.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>that's all but i am not any or acting pro. just commenting in a viewer's point of view.</p>
              <p>When i make my own videos sometimes such things happen. </p>
              <p>teens and youths nowsadays are so lucky to be able to use high tech equipment and chance to take up media creation related courses . good start.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>go the right way dont be like some people i met acquitance in the past almost 40 years old already spend the last 6 years shooting lousy video dont even know how to use basic software to cut join and produce a basic clip. just press cam button and stop and then jus upload the clip up nd worse is still got people say good.</p>

              <p>Storyline versus title. Patriotic seems like a strong word. i will think a soldier NS or army/ home team related theme will be more appropriate?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>maybe use similar title like  a place to call home'?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No voting from me at the moment as i have not seen the other competing (if there is) videos and participating works yet.</p>

              <p>what winning means so much ? your video got exceptinal high votes. cnnot be like that unfair to the rest of the contestants. i didnt like and when to the homepage to see what the contest is about. 11 pages average about a few videos per page. will go through them later in teh day after i wake from my vampire sleep and see one by one. as this are secondary schools category, probably most are limited with entry / mid-level cams, some of the random videos i just clicked ona nd watched has good editing and timeline skills.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>dont write so much after i watched all the categories will cum out with one best per category, and then of the best per category i will pick my overall best. just wish the site and video upload scould have been arrnaged proper for ease of viewer then rating / likes.</p>

              <p><br>seems like TS exagerated patrism here. go to the video link and navigate to the site mainpage, there are a few categories, nothign about partism.</p>
              <p>i thik this is unfair to the opther participants. its not like youtube videos where you like and subcribe so that the uploader can upload more videos. here it seems like some competition going on between secondary schools! and i wonder the likes may have some power in deciding the winner.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>please voters, watch all other videos before you 'like' inthis case. its not fair to the other contestants!</p>

              <p>okay. have 2 tyoes of singapore made videos below. you be the judge. A id definietly better than B. becasue A is definitely done by pro, semi-pro, enthusiasts, with actors talented and all gather with one mind and heart to produce a kick-ass MV. B probably a few of them have a heart to made, but lack the nexcessaery skills, equipment, visions, and definitely not allthe actors subjects participants are - well i should say, 'gifted'.</p>
