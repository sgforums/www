            <div class='col-md body'>some interesting articles to share:<br><br>QUOTE<br>Imagine your boyfriend died in an accident, and his parents made a clone to replace him.<br><br>Agreed. This is plain sick, toying with emotions and feelings. And shouldn't be done. But if the boyfriend is alive but dying from a terminal disease, would it then be okay to clone him?<br><br>QUOTE<br>I'm more on the side of being frightened. What if one day someone made a clone out of u?<br><br>I'm scared too. Thus cloning should never be done without the original person's permission, that's what you're saying? ok.<br><br>QUOTE<br>theoretically if the human clone was of your genetic makeup, would it have the same fingerprints as you?<br><br>It's likely, yes. But not necessarily. Fingerprints are unlike DNA, fingerprints are more prone to environmental conditions.<br><br>QUOTE<br>But one thing remains, the clone has no roots, no identity of its own and most importantly no soul.<br><br>How do you know this? Do you have a sensor which can detect the presence of a soul? Who are you to define what a soul is, in the first place? How would you like it, if someone came up to you and said you have no soul? You wouldn't be able to prove them wrong, because there's no way of knowing.<br><br>QUOTE<br>bloody. DNA tests won't prove much anymore<br><br>Science and law could get around this problem. Regulate and monitor the birth of every clone, and instead of making an exact carbon copy, simply insert a genetic marker, any tiny insignificant change to differentiate between the clone and the original. Like the colour of one's eyes, for eg. Unfortunately, there will always be rogue cloners who will break the law. It's not preventable, but that doesn't mean cloning should be banned. Just like painkilling drugs shouldn't be banned just because there are people who will abuse it.<br><br>QUOTE<br>Should we bless or curse eve (the first human clone)?<br><br>It's not eve who should be judged. It's people who think this way (but no offense to you, I'm sure you didn't mean it this way) who will form a posse and hunt clones down to murder/torture them. (Like X-Men. People hating mutants who had no choice over their powers)<br>It's clonaid that should be blessed/cursed. And I say curse them because mankind is not ready for cloning yet. Morally, as well as technologically. The topic still needs to be thought about and researched further.<br><br>I've read up some of the philosophies on the Raelian Movement, and I must say a lot of their teachings severely lack the same kind of depth that one easily finds in the bible/koran/etc. While their theory about aliens is interesting and possible, their words and way of thinking immediately turn me off. This Rael guy lives in a overly idealistic world and tries too hard to criticize EVERY aspect of humanity which, while sometimes deplorable, are the same aspects which define us as humans. He also seems very uneducated and seems like he's simply trying to 'smoke' his way through.<br><br>QUOTE<br>about getting a superior race of human beings<br><br>Genetic engineering has been going on for centuries. In the feudal days, royalty were only allowed to marry other royalty, not the simplefolk. The reasoning was to preserve the superior, royal blood, blood which has been proven to wisely lead empires and win wars. And when a bad egg appears (eg a mad king), genetic engineering again occurs, but by the simplefolk instead. The people would revolt and overthrow the king, to make sure this "genetic accident" (ie the king) would not be allowed to pass on his genes to future rulers.<br><br>Even today, we practise it. Your family would certainly object to you marrying someone who has a terminal genetic disease, no matter how much you loved him/her. And some religious people will only marry those of the same religion, not really because their blood is superior, but simply because they want to preserve their religion and their way of life. These religious people, who are so critical of engineering people, are themselves guilty of the same crime. Also, when the government gives everyone a hepatitis injection to immunise everyone against the disease, isn't this also a way of "tailor-making" humans? Granted, cloning is taking things to the extreme, but law and common sense will prevail.<br><br>QUOTE<br>if i were to contract some terminal illness, will my clone get it too?<br><br>No. It's a bit like if two people have the HIV virus (but this is a crude example). Not necessarily both will contract and suffer from AIDS. Genetic diseases are unpredictable. Your grandmother may have died from cancer, and her genes passed down to your mother. But she can still lead a healthy cancer-free life. Unfortunately, the genes can still be passed down to you. And by some twisted stroke of bad luck, the genes may activate themselves anytime along the line.<br><br>QUOTE<br>no idea why some humans out there want to concentrate on such issues rather than use the money and concentrate on helping the current people who are suffering : the poor, the hungry, the sick, the dying.<br><br>Actually, the sick and the dying are the very people whom cloning seeks to help.<br><br>QUOTE<br>cloning is agnst nature!!!<br><br>But everything humanity does is against nature. Everything's either natural, or manmade. Wearing a condom is against nature, just like living in a house out of bricks is against nature.<br><br>QUOTE<br>then look at nuclear weapons. they're SUPER HARMFUL, yet people still want to make them to prove "YES I CAN DO IT! I IS THE POWDERFULEST!"<br><br>Nuclear weapons is another thing entirely. Yes they're "super harmful", but they're also the same reason why you haven't had a world war and lost millions of lives in the past fifty years. Nuclear power technology is acutally far cleaner and more efficient than nearly every power plant in the world. It produces no external pollution, because all the pollution can be contained in barrels of toxic waste, unlike the smoke that rises out of other powerplants. It's more reliable than wind and hydroelectric plants. But of course, if you're careless, something goes wrong, and that leads to disaster. The same goes with cloning.<br><br>QUOTE<br>Why dont they just spend money on bridging racial harmony instead of these research.<br><br>To be honest, I actually agree. Cloning may not be totally wrong, but there certainly are other priorities which are way more important.<br><br>QUOTE<br>I would be more at ease if these project was carried out by the governments of the world with a shared database.<br><br>Agreed. Totally. But I may say a different thing if I had a child who was dying fast, and if governmental red tape was delaying her treatment (which involves cloning). I may just turn to a rogue organisation. Human emotions are tricky. You may say one thing, but change your mind if the situation suddenly turned against you.<br><br>QUOTE<br>To human is to err, to live, to love, to die.<br><br>I agree. I'd want to die at some point in time. But what if you found out you were going to die one month before your daughter's (for eg) wedding? And if you want to extend your life just a little bit. ISn't this the same as giving drug cocktails to people who are suffering from AIDS, just so they can extend their life a little bit... ? This is the kind of moral issue that needs to be thought about.<br><br>I believe cloning should be thought about more. Not condemn it so quickly like some people. Nor rush into it like Clonaid.<br><br>by frooze</div>

Who are you to define what a soul is, in the first place?<br><br>I would compare a newly cloned person to a person who had lost all his memory, don't know his name, don't know his past, how frightening can that be. He may have his soul, but this poor soul is breathing in a world of fear just as a new-born baby. Ok, as for a newly cloned baby, his roots and identity is determined by those who fostered him or should I say his genetic parents.<br><br>QUOTE<br>Science and law could get around this problem.<br><br>In the distant future, I really doubt the effectiveness of DNA identification.
