But why the malaysian hate us so much when we gave them so many jobs and oppotunities?? (and sacrificing our own citizens)<br><br>Bcos those who hated Singapore are malaysians of a different agenda..........their main purpose is eliminate singapore. they scold, they bash us, they even shout "war" on us and they try to instigate our own people to revolt against us.....but wat is their true intention? patriotism? nationalism? pro-malaysia? I beg to differ. these are the one who only see us in the eyes of malaysian newspapers and propaganda.<br><br>But those who work in SG are a different lot......they've been here, they know the difference and they understand. They are the one's I made friends.<br><br>I don't hate malaysians in general lah......I got many frenz and I work closely wif them............but i can't help to hate those who bash and blast us..... on TV, outside embassy gates and newspapers....what is their intention?

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes. I have a lot of malaysian friends too. They too understand, am and not so boliao like their government.<br><br>Some said that the "Dr M wanted to resign" is a plot where he wanted to acertain his popularity with his delegates.<br><br>Increasing the price of water, building the ports to compete with PSA, developing airport faciliates, getting the land of the railway in singapore, etc. Some say all those actions are targeted at an "aim" of not increasing the country's economy in future, but, increasing the country's economy in the future by stealing the income from sg.<br><br>There's nothing wrong with developing ports, airways, transport facilities to compete for business. Since sg is the only country in this region with the strongest economy, it is only "correct" that the her northern neighbour targets her. Some sporeans might feel threatened or even hatren, but other then singaporeans themselves work hard and maintain competiveness, there is nothing we can do about it.<br><br>Times are changing, pple, much as i do not like the maalaysian government, there is no choice. They are our neighbour, we must try to maintain relations as best as possible. They throw whatever shit at us, we just cannot simply just throw back at them. Malaysia can simply blasts their complains and accusations over their media but our mature cannot do that. Our government is doing the delicate task of giving way if possible, but still maintaining our interests.<br><br>To side track, I really like what the PAP is doing. I know many people do not support PAP during elections, but, can any other party lead in somehting like this? PAP is something we cannot do without.</div>
