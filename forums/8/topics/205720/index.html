            <div class='col-md body'>Subject: Beware of diet soft drinks<br><br>Diet Softdrink is doing it...<br><br>Please read this! It may help you or someone you know.<br><br>In October of 2001, my sister started getting very sick. She had<br>stomach spasms and she was having a hard time getting around. Walking<br>was a major chore. It took everything she had just to get out<br>of bed; she was in so much pain.<br><br>By March 2002, she had undergone several tissue and muscle biopsies<br>and was on 24 various prescription medications. The doctors could not<br>determine what was wrong with her. She was in so much pain, and so<br>sick...she just knew she was dying.<br><br>She put her house, bank accounts, life insurance, etc., in her oldest<br>daughters name, and made sure that her younger children were to be<br>taken care of.. She also wanted her last hooray, so she planned a trip<br>to FL (basically in a wheelchair) for March 22nd.<br><br>On March 19th I called her to ask how her most recent tests went, and<br>she said they didn't find anything on the test, but they believe she<br>had MS. (Multiple Sclerosis)<br><br>I recalled an article a friend of mine E-mailed to me and I asked my<br>sister if she drank diet soda? She told me that she did. As a matter<br>of fact, she was getting ready to crack one open that moment... I told<br>her not to open it, and to stop drinking the diet soda !!! I E-mailed<br>her the article my friend, a lawyer, had sent.<br><br>My sister called me within 32 hours after our phone conversation and<br>told me she had stopped drinking the diet soda AND she could walk!!!!<br>The muscle spasms went away. She said she didn't feel 100% but she<br>sure felt a lot better. She told me she was going to her doctor with<br>this article and would call me when she got home.<br><br>Well, she called me, and said her doctor was amazed! He is going to<br>call all of his MS patients to find out if they consumed artificial<br>sweeteners of any kind...<br><br>In a nutshell, she was being poisoned by the Aspartame in the diet<br>soda... and literally dying a slow and miserable death.<br>When she got to FL March 22nd, all she had to take was one pill, and<br>that was a pill for the Aspartame poisoning! She is well on her way to<br>a complete recovery . and she is walking!!! No wheelchair!!!<br><br>This article saved her life.<br><br>If it says "SUGAR FREE" on the label, DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT IT!!!<br><br>I have spent several days lecturing at the WORLD ENVIRONMENTAL<br>CONFERENCE on "ASPARTAME," marketed as 'NutraSweet,' 'Equal,' and<br>'Spoonful.'<br><br>In the keynote address by the EPA, it was announced that in the United<br>States in 2001 there is an epidemic of multiple sclerosis and systemic<br>lupus. It was difficult to determine exactly what toxin was causing<br>this to be rampant.<br><br>I stood up and said that I was there to lecture on exactly that<br>subject. I will explain why Aspartame is so dangerous: When the<br>temperature of this sweetener exceeds 86 degrees F, the wood alcohol<br>in ASPARTAME converts to formaldehyde and then to formic acid, which<br>in turn causes metabolic acidosis. Formic acid is the poison found in<br>the sting of fire ants. The methanol toxicity mimics, among other<br>conditions, multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus. Many people were<br>being diagnosed in error. Although multiple sclerosis is not a death<br>sentence..., methanol toxicity is!<br><br>Systemic lupus has become almost as rampant as multiple sclerosis,<br>especially with Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi drinkers. The victim usually<br>does not know that the Aspartame is the culprit. He or she continues<br>its use; irritating the lupus to such a degree that it may become a<br>life-threatening condition.. We have seen patients with systemic lupus<br>become asymptotic, once taken off diet sodas.<br><br>In cases of those diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis, (when in reality,<br>the disease is methanol toxicity), most of the symptoms disappear.<br>We've seen many cases where vision loss returned and hearing loss<br>improved markedly.<br><br>This also applies to cases of tinnitus and fibromyalgia.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>During a lecture, I said, "If you are using ASPARTAME (NutraSweet,<br>Equal, Spoonful, etc.) and you suffer from fibromyalgia symptoms,<br>spasms, shooting, pains, numbness in your legs, cramps, vertigo,<br>dizziness, headaches, tinnitus, joint pain, unexplainable depression,<br>anxiety attacks, slurred speech, blurred vision, or memory loss...,<br>you probably have ASPARTAME poisoning!"<br><br>People were jumping up during the lecture saying, "I have some of<br>these symptoms."<br>Is it reversible?" Yes! Yes! Yes! STOP drinking diet sodas and be<br>alert for Aspartame on food labels!<br>Many products are fortified with it!!!<br><br>This is a serious problem. Dr. Espart (one of my speakers) remarked<br>that so many people seem to be symptomatic for MS and during his<br>recent visit to a hospice; a nurse stated that six of her friends, who<br>were heavy Diet Coke addicts, had all been diagnosed with MS. This is<br>beyond coincidence!<br>Diet soda is NOT a diet product! It is a chemically altered, multiple<br>SODIUM (salt) and ASPARTAME containing product that actually makes you<br>crave carbohydrates. It is far more likely to make you GAIN weight!<br><br>These products also contain formaldehyde, which stores in the fat<br>cells, particularly in the hips and thighs. Formaldehyde is an<br>absolute toxin and is used primarily to preserve "tissue specimens."<br><br>Many products we use every day contain this chemical but we SHOULD NOT<br>store it IN our body!!!<br><br>Dr. H. J. Roberts stated in his lectures that once free of the "diet<br>products" and with no significant increase in exercise; his patients<br>lost an average of 19 pounds over a trial period.<br><br>Aspartame is especially dangerous for diabetics. We found that some<br>physicians, who believed that they had a patient with retinopathy, in<br>fact, had symptoms caused by Aspartame. The Aspartame drives the blood<br>sugar out of control. Thus diabetics may suffer acute memory loss due<br>to the fact that aspartic acid and phenylalanine are NEUROTOXIC when<br>taken without the other amino acids necessary for a good balance.<br><br>Treating diabetes is all about BALANCE. Especially with diabetics, the<br>Aspartame passes the blood/brain barrier and it then deteriorates the<br>neurons of the brain; causing various levels of brain damage,<br>seizures, depression, manic depression, panic attacks, uncontrollable<br>anger and rage.<br><br>Consumption of Aspartame causes these same symptoms in non-diabetics, as well.<br><br>Documentation and observation also reveal that thousands of children<br>diagnosed with ADD and AHD have had complete turnarounds in their<br>behavior when these chemicals have been removed from their diet. So<br>called "behavior modification prescription drugs" (Ritalin and others)<br>are no longer needed. Truth be told, they were never NEEDED in the<br>first place!<br><br>Most of these children were being "poisoned" on a daily basis with the<br>very foods that were "better for them than sugar."<br>It is also suspected that the Aspartame in thousands of pallets of<br>diet Coke and diet Pepsi consumed by men and women fighting in the<br>Gulf War, may be partially to blame for the well-known Gulf War<br>Syndrome.<br><br>Dr. Roberts warns that it can cause birth defects, i.e., mental<br>retardation, if taken at the time of conception and during early<br>pregnancy. Children are especially at risk for neurological disorders<br>and should NEVER be given artificial sweeteners. There are many<br>different case histories to relate of children suffering grand mal<br>seizures and other neurological disturbances due to the use of<br>NutraSweet.<br><br>Unfortunately, it is not always easy to convince people that Aspartame<br>is to blame for their child's illness. Stevia, which, which is a sweet<br>herb, NOT A MANUFACTURED ADDITIVE, helps in the metabolism of sugar,<br>which would be ideal for diabetics. It has now been approved as a<br>dietary supplement by the FDA. It is known that for many years the FDA<br>outlawed this true sweet food," due to their loyalty to MONSANTO<br>Chemical Company."<br><br>Books on this subject are available:<br><br>EXCITOTOXINS: THE TASTE THAT KILLS written by Dr. Russell Blayblock<br>(Health Press 1-800-643-2665) AND: DEFENSE AGAINST ALZHEIMER'S<br>DISEASE-written by DR H. J. Roberts, also a diabetic specialist.<br><br>These two doctors will soon be posting a position paper with case<br>histories on the deadly effects of Aspartame on the Internet.<br>According to the Conference of the American College of Physicians, "We<br>are talking about a plague of neurological diseases directly caused by<br>the use of this deadly poison."<br><br>Herein lies the problem: There were Congressional Hearings when<br>Aspartame was included 100 different products and strong objection was<br>made concerning it's use. Since this initial hearing, there have been<br>two subsequent hearings and still, nothing has been done. The drug and<br>chemical lobbies have very deep pockets. Sadly, MONSANTO'S patent on<br>Aspartame has EXPIRED!!<br><br>There are now over 5,000 products on the market that contain this<br>deadly chemical and there will be thousands more introduced.<br><br>Everybody wants a "piece of the Aspartame pie." I assure you that<br>MONSANTO, the creator of Aspartame, knows how deadly it is. And isn't<br>it ironic that MONSANTO funds, among others, the American Diabetes<br>Association, the American Dietetic Association and the Conference of<br>the American College of Physicians? This has been recently exposed in<br>the New York Times. These cannot criticize any additives or convey<br>their link to MONSANTO because they take money from the food industry<br>and are required to endorse their products.<br><br>Senator Howard Metzenbaum wrote and presented a bill that would<br>require label warnings on products containing Aspartame, especially<br>regarding pregnant women, children and infants. The bill would also<br>institute independent studies on the known dangers and the problems<br>existing in the general population regarding seizures, changes in<br>brain chemistry, neurological changes and behavioral symptoms. The<br>bill was killed.<br><br>It is known that the powerful drug and chemical lobbies are<br>responsible for this, letting loose the hounds of disease and death on<br>an unsuspecting and uninformed public.<br><br>Well, you're informed now!!!! YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW!!!!<br>Please print this out and/or e-mail to your family and friends. They<br>have a right to know too.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Whenever the subject of sugars and artificial sweeteners comes up, inevitabley someone brings the discussion around to Splenda.<br><br>People tend to think that because the FDA approved it that it's fine to ingest.<br><br>However, in her new book, SplendaÂ® Is It Safe or Not? toxicologist/artificial sweetener expert Janet Hull, Ph.D. reveals that scientific evidence strongly suggest that the chemical sweetener may be harmful.<br>Dr. Hull explains that SplendaÂ® research documents that the artificial sweetener has negative effects on the livers, spleens and kidneys of laboratory animals and numbness of the hind legs of male rats.<br><br>Additional research, she found, cites recurring laboratory results of infertility in male rats and gastrointestinal problems in pregnant rats fed Splenda.<br><br>Â“Consumers are not being told the whole truth about the long-term dangers of using artificial chemical sweeteners," Dr. Hull insists.<br><br>"No one has considered the fact that chemical sweeteners may be at the root of many unexplained disease symptoms that puzzle your doctor.Â”<br><br>In fact, Dr. Hull notes, Â“giving sugar-free chemicals to your children or using them during pregnancy may be harmful to a childÂ’s emotional and physical maturation and to the normal development of a fetus.Â”<br><br>Dr. Janet Hull is author of Sweet Poison: How The WorldÂ’s Most Popular Artificial Sweetener Is Killing Us Â– My Story, which chronicles her gripping battle with a near-fatal disease that she believes is caused by aspartame found in NutraSweet/EqualÂ®. She is also an OSHA certified engineer, and she has degrees in nutrition, environmental toxicology and geology.<br><br>What Are Artificial Sweeteners and Why Are They Harmful?<br><br>Artificial sweeteners are a mix of unnatural chemicals, combined in a laboratory that the body canÂ’t naturally process.  Basically, these chemicals either accumulate in your vital organs (causing possible damage later), pollute your bloodstream (causing possible damage later), or form the basis for eventual mutations of your cells (causing possible damage later).<br><br>NATURE VERSUS MANMADE:  The Key To Â“SafeÂ” Food<br><br>In a nutshell, what nature generally creates for food is typically safe for your body:  whatever man creates for food (from chemicals in the laboratory) may not be accepted by your body as safe and can result in illness.  Our bodies are like machines (only natural) that operate today just as they did thousands of years ago. They donÂ’t Â“understandÂ” manmade chemicals as a source of nourishment and cannot fully process them. Forcing Â“foreignÂ” materials into your body is like pouring shampoo into your carÂ’s gas tank: it wasnÂ’t meant to process it, so the engine stalls and stops working, and the chemical by-products obstruct your body systems.<br><br>Which Artificial Sweeteners Should You Avoid?<br><br>Sucralose (SplendaÂ®)<br>Aspartame (NutraSweet/EqualÂ®)<br>Acesulfame-K (SunettÂ®)<br>NeotameÂ®<br>AlitameÂ®<br>Cyclamate<br>SPLENDA: THE NEW KID ON THE BLOCK<br><br>What Exactly Is Splenda?<br><br>Splenda is the trade name for sucralose, a relatively new manmade, artificial sweetener. Johnson &amp; Johnson bought the rights in 1998 to sell sucralose in the United States as Splenda. Its basic characteristics are:<br><br>Its taste is nearly identical to sugar because itÂ’s made from sugar<br>Its Â“trademarkÂ” inability to break down in processing or in storage<br>So why is Splenda potentially harmful?<br><br>It contains chlorine, which is a carcinogen.  The Splenda marketers insure the chlorine is chemically Â“boundÂ” so it cannot be Â“releasedÂ” in the body during digestion.  I question that, and wonder if this artificial chemical can safely pass through the human body.  Wait until you read what chlorine can do to the body.  Bad news.<br><br>Sucralose (Splenda) is a chlorocarbon - a chlorine-containing compound. The chlorocarbons have long been known for causing organ, genetic, and reproductive damage. It should be no surprise, then, that testing of sucralose revealed organ, genetic, and reproductive damage.  Research on lab rats showed up to forty percent shrinkage of the thymus gland: a gland that is the very foundation of our immune system.  The contamination of water supplies by chlorocarbons is a serious problem in most European countries today, making many people very ill and warranting cancer studies. Due to the chlorine content in Splenda, sucralose can inflame swelling of the liver and kidneys, and calcification of the kidney, as shown in animal studies.  If you experience kidney pain, cramping, or an irritated bladder after using sucralose, stop using it immediately.<br><br>Sucralose is patented as a manmade Â“chlorinated sucrose sweetenerÂ” and it is registered as Â“chlorinated sucrose.Â”  Chlorinated sucrose is not found anywhere in nature, like real sugar (sucrose) that is extracted from sugar cane and sugar beets. If it were, it would be a carcinogen!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Aspartame (commonly misspelled as aspertame)</strong><br><br>Aspartame, a dipeptide of aspartic acid and a methyl ester of phenylalanine, is approved for use in pharmaceutical products and is being used increasingly in chewable tablet and sugar-free formulations. Labels for both prescription and nonprescription products must include the phenylalanine content. The major consideration in the use of aspartame in children is in patients with autosomal recessive phenylketonuria. Although heterozygotes do not appear to have clinically significant increases in phenylalanine after ingestion of even large amounts (equivalent to 24 12-oz cans of diet beverages), homozygotes with strict dietary restrictions should avoid aspartame. Children without dietary restrictions could safely ingest 10 mg/kg/d. [37-40]. Dietary consumption of aspartame is typically less than 5 mg/kg/d[41]; young children, however, could ingest considerably more. For example, a 2-year-old child weighing 12 kg consumes 17 mg/kg from drinking one 12-oz can of diet soda and one serving of a sweetened product (eg, cereal, pudding, gelatin, or frozen dessert).<br><br><span style="color: red;">Headache is the most common adverse side effect attributed to aspartame but is seldom confirmed by single-dose double-blind challenge. Up to 11% of patients with chronic migraine headaches reported headaches triggered by aspartame; however, a double-blind challenge with three doses of 10 mg/kg given every 2 hours triggered no more headaches than did placebos in patients with vascular headaches believed to be exacerbated by aspartame. A small, double-blind 4-week trial showed an increase in frequency of headaches after ingestion of 1200 mg/d, indicating that a longer challenge period may be necessary.<br><br>In anecdotal reports, aspartame has been linked to various neuropsychiatric disorders, including panic attacks, mood changes, visual hallucinations, manic episodes, and isolated dizziness. A small, double-blind crossover study of patients with major depression revealed a higher incidence of reactions in these patients compared with nondepressed volunteers after administration of 30 mg/kg for 7 days; symptoms included headache, nervousness, dizziness, memory impairment, nausea, temper outbursts, and depression. None of these conditions has been rigorously proven to be caused by aspartame, but carefully conducted double-blind challenges may be indicated in patients with histories that suggest aspartame as a cause. Patients with underlying mitral valve prolapse or affective disorders may be at increased risk for neuropsychiatric effects; several studies have shown that individuals without psychiatric or seizure disorders do not demonstrate these effects.<br><br>Seizures have been reported via passive surveillance data collected by the FDA and in a few case reports. A recent analysis of FDA reports showed 41 cases of rechallenge with a temporal relationship to aspartame consumption. Most seizures occurred in patients who had an acceptable dietary intake, except for a 16-year-old who ingested up to 57 mg/kg of aspartame. Aspartame is generally considered safe for children with epilepsy. One study found increased spike-wave discharges in children with untreated absence seizures after a high dose of aspartame and suggested that children with poorly controlled absence seizures avoid aspartame. </span><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's true. I've known it for some time (I'm a Biologist), and have personally experienced aspartame poisoning. Different people react differently to it (ie. some more severe, some macham no effect).
