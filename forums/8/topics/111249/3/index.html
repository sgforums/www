THey are pictures of chaos is EAST TIMOR, and is taken BEFORE 1998.  While i agree that indonesian soldiers have done inhuman acts, there are also reports that some of the pictures are actually soldiers doing investigations.<br><br>So don't present false info and pictures to make a stand.<br><br>Fact 3:<br>The indonesians affecting in Banda Aceh and those involved in the 1998 Riots are totally different groups of people.
