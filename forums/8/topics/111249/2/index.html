We must not have hate against people and we should love and help instead.<br><br>However, i have doubts giving money to indonesia because of the corruption. End up the money go to their ministers and presidents, to fly first class and stay in 5 star hotels etc.<br><br>Donation fo money must stop,  giving items such as food, blanket etc will be more effective.<br><br>PEACE</div>
