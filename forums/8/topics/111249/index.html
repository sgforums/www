            <div class='col-md body'>If it's God's way of punishing, then i feel they have suffered enough. After all, who are WE to punish? Who are we to play God? Im sure God has plans for people who harm his people. Besides, if we judge them now when they need our help and we refuse help to them becoz of such grudges... are we any better than them?<br><br>I still think we should help them.. Not becoz they are GREAT people, or becoz they deserve our help. But simply becoz we have a bigger heart and we are greater people. Its not about them. ITs about uS! it should show what kind of people we are... to give our help.<br>Not what kind of people they are.. to receive the help.<br><br>Please. Do you want to bear this grudge? Do you want to turn a deaf ear to all the pain and sufferings? I plead with you to Love those who have hurt us... for that is the greatest kind of love.<br><br>It is EASY to love a great person. Any normal person will love a wonderful man. But it takes a greater person to love someone who have hurt him. I cant say im not hurt by the pictures... i cried and i felt very disappointed. But after that, all the more now, i think we should help. The riots are over and there was nothing we could do to help our people.. but NOW, there IS something for us to do... to help others. others who are suffering like our people have.<br><br>Will we stand by and watch people suffer just because we have been hurt? Let them see how great the people are who have suffered in their hands. Let's love them and show them that they have slaughtered people who loved them. People who are their saviours.</div>

These rioters do not support a cause. Like many other crises, people have taken advantage of anarchy to loot, rape, pillage and rob as they know they would be scot-free.<br><br>Fact 2:<br>The pictures you have shown in the link, have already been proven to be in accurate. THey are pictures of chaos is EAST TIMOR, and is taken BEFORE 1998.  While i agree that indonesian soldiers have done inhuman acts, there are also reports that some of the pictures are actually soldiers doing investigations.<br><br>So don't present false info and pictures to make a stand.<br><br>Fact 3:<br>The indonesians affecting in Banda Aceh and those involved in the 1998 Riots are totally different groups of people. You are simply stereotyping them.<br><br>Fact 4:<br>156,000 people has died and numbers will rise. Even if you do not want to donate to the indonesians, there are people in the entire asian region affected. Do think for them and do your part in any way you can. Rather than trying to be anti-donating.</div>
