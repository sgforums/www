            <div class='col-md body'>I have bought a sofa recently.At the time when i ordered the sofa, i told the lady that i will confirm the color with her later. So i told her to leave the color as black at the moment. She told me anything just let her know.<br><br>So when my replacement sofa came in 1 week later, i realize that cream is better. I called both the branches at furniture mall and harbour front at look for her. The staff at both branches did not offer me much help. They just take down my name, contact and invoice number and said that they will get fl******(the sales woman) to call me back. I waited for 1 week. No reply.I make another call to the company only to know that fl****** is at singapore expo. I went there the next day after work.<br><br>Upon telling her that i would like to change my sofa color to cream. She said,"Cannot lar. Order already how to change. I cannot help you" And she goes around entertaining her other customers. Didn't even bother about me even when i waited at her booth for half an hour. I called office the following day to inform them that i need to reconfirm my sofa color, they said they will get the manager to call me again. Again, i waited 1 WEEK for a manager to return my call. During the 1 week that i waited, i make numerous calls to ask if theres anyone who can help me. The china girl who answered the phone was rude and unhelpful. I even quarrel on the phone with her on 3 different occusions. When the manager finally called, the only solution she said was," You can forfeit your deposit and order another sofa lor.  Then your original sofa we will try to sell to someone else". I paid $600 as a deposit and she told me to forfeit off?? What type of service is this? Isn't $600 money also? She even said i called them too late. But at first, i tried to look for fl******(sales woman), called the office to leave messages, argued with the rude china girl answering the phone.<br><br>And waited 1 whole week for the manager to call me. This is the type of customer service i received? Yes, i have paid the deposit, but i am sure there's something they can do to help? The sofa is still in japan. Not even shipped into singapore yet. One point to add, when i asked the sales woman where is the sofa made, she give me a confirm answer,"ITALY." When i called to check with the main office, i was told it was from made in JAPAN. Upon further questioning , the china girl said its was made in GERMANY. I think to myself "Even if made in malaysia or thailand i also don't know what. Who knows, i have been coned into buying a sofa that they have leave in their warehouse for your time. Thats why they delayed my call and insisted not to help me with the change of color. Now i lan-lan have to use back the black color that was initially written on the invoice. Just a lesson to warn everyone who is out look for furnitures for your new house. Beware of this company "C****O" They have 2 branches. 1 in furniture mall and 1 in harbour front. If you happen to pass by, don't be coned by them. They can promise you anything b4 you pay the deposit. But after you pay already, Thats a different story altogether.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

I wrote to ST forum, kana rejected, called CASE, they take days to reply and expect you to sign up as memeber at $25/yr before they look into your case and I have to do all running just for a &lt;$100 issue. Warning: don't ever buy furniture from NOVENA GROUP or THE WHITE COLLECTION, or NOVENA OR CASTILLA. Very bad service one!!!!! You'll regret it.<br><br>If you are interested to know my case... search under 'Help needed with bad experience with furniture retailer' on this forum.<br><br>I've learnt to be smart leow and won't go about chasing people and waste my time and efforts running about crazy like you do anymore.<br><br>If store can be a rogue, you can be a rogue customer too. My thoughts are below, however, if you use any of them it's none of my business and you are doing it on your own free will!!! I'm not involved.<br><br>1) Soft method: Call HQ and request to speak to CEO (speaking to managers no use one). Of course secretary will say CEO not free, just say you wanna make an appoint to speak to him on the phone today about something that matters to his company's reputation. Make sure you sound urgent and serious! and kinda threaten the secretary that if you do not get to speak to the CEO,should anything goes wrong, she would bear the responsibility. Don't let her know you story yet. If she ask who you are, just say the company's stakeholder (customers are companies indirect stakeholders wat). Then complain to the CEO. Make sure you mention his subordinates' names i.e. the manager who din't call you back and the salesperson's name and branch whatever. They will get it one from the CEO one.<br><br>Ask the CEO what kinda of business he is running with such bad service? Doesn't he want repeat customers? If not, then his company is a cheat! (coz only cheaters don't do repeat business)<br><br>2) Hard Method: Create a din at their exhibition. Scare away their potential customers<br><br>3) Semi-hard method: Let them deliver the good and you scrutinize the goods. Anything not happy (e.g. color of goods), tell the deliver person to say you are not paying the rest of the balance and you want them to resend.(he can leave the furniture with you if he doesn't want to carry it back and you can use the item to your advantage. Treat the delivery man nice nice and persuade him to leave the furniture with you). That way, the store will definitely call you if you don't pay up when you get the goods!!! heheh.<br><br>Otherwise, just keep the ding-donging of goods loh.... as long as you don't pay the balance, they cannot close account and they will call you to settle.<br><br>In the meantime, if you really very eng, spend $25 to sign up as CASE member to start paper proceedings but personally I won't do that.It will cost you more time and effort. Not worth it for $600. However, shoot a letter to ST and send all your contacts a copy of your experience to warn others about them and to spread them on.<br><br>What is store's name har??? I like to know leh.<br><br></div>

I wrote to ST forum, kana rejected, called CASE, they take days to reply and expect you to sign up as memeber at $25/yr before they look into your case and I have to do all running just for a &lt;$100 issue. Warning: don't ever buy furniture from NOVENA GROUP or THE WHITE COLLECTION, or NOVENA OR CASTILLA. Very bad service one!!!!! You'll regret it.<br><br>If you are interested to know my case... search under 'Help needed with bad experience with furniture retailer' on this forum.<br><br>I've learnt to be smart leow and won't go about chasing people and waste my time and efforts running about crazy like you do anymore.<br><br>If store can be a rogue, you can be a rogue customer too. My thoughts are below, however, if you use any of them it's none of my business and you are doing it on your own free will!!! I'm not involved.<br><br>1) Soft method: Call HQ and request to speak to CEO (speaking to managers no use one). Of course secretary will say CEO not free, just say you wanna make an appoint to speak to him on the phone today about something that matters to his company's reputation. Make sure you sound urgent and serious! and kinda threaten the secretary that if you do not get to speak to the CEO,should anything goes wrong, she would bear the responsibility. Don't let her know you story yet. If she ask who you are, just say the company's stakeholder (customers are companies indirect stakeholders wat). Then complain to the CEO. Make sure you mention his subordinates' names i.e. the manager who din't call you back and the salesperson's name and branch whatever. They will get it one from the CEO one.<br><br>Ask the CEO what kinda of business he is running with such bad service? Doesn't he want repeat customers? If not, then his company is a cheat! (coz only cheaters don't do repeat business)<br><br>2) Hard Method: Create a din at their exhibition. Scare away their potential customers<br><br>3) Semi-hard method: Let them deliver the good and you scrutinize the goods. Anything not happy (e.g. color of goods), tell the deliver person to say you are not paying the rest of the balance and you want them to resend.(he can leave the furniture with you if he doesn't want to carry it back and you can use the item to your advantage. Treat the delivery man nice nice and persuade him to leave the furniture with you). That way, the store will definitely call you if you don't pay up when you get the goods!!! heheh.<br><br>Otherwise, just keep the ding-donging of goods loh.... as long as you don't pay the balance, they cannot close account and they will call you to settle.<br><br>In the meantime, if you really very eng, spend $25 to sign up as CASE member to start paper proceedings but personally I won't do that.It will cost you more time and effort. Not worth it for $600. However, shoot a letter to ST and send all your contacts a copy of your experience to warn others about them and to spread them on.<br><br>What is store's name har??? I like to know leh.<br><br>[b]<br>The shop name is CELATO<br></strong></div>
