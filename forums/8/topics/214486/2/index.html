They prolly cant ask thier own worker to work overnite cause company might have to pay more.

Hypermarkets' stocks very siong de leh, all come in pallets. Can't imaging the whole storage and backyard jammed and packed with pallets and cartons laying here and there, and pallets and stocks are not supposed to be parked in sales floor unattended. And the pallets of stocks etc or cartons etc cannot be parked anywhere which block the fire extinguishers or fire exits because of very important strict rules.<br><br>Actually hypermarkets, supermarkets and convenient stores' salary are about the same. In fact most only pay about $700 plus to $800 plus per month for normal full-time day time retail assistant (merchandising), $900 plus to $1000 plus for the junior Supervisors. And yes, some supermarkets have permanent full-time midnight retail assistants who merchandise, replenish and stacks the stocks after the store close at night. Normally only those big and busy outlets have such midnight staffs. Their salary is only a bit more than normal daytime staffs.<br><br>Relax, maybe the guy on the phone was annoyed because of handling so many phone calls anwering the same questions, and maybe you happened to be the 50th person to call <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">.</div>

Anyway, dad told me nt to take the underpaid job. Not worth it. So i didnt work.<br><br>yup, dun work let ppl do lor.. In conculsion. Singapore should haf Minimum wage.<br><br>Example. People who work nightshift should be paid reasonably higher then day shift. Considering those who got family, at night work, day time slp, no time to accompany kidz n wife. Yup. Just one of my idea.<br><br>What u guys gotta say? </div></blockquote>you can wait long long for a minimum wage rule to be implemented.If such a rule come up,it will only go against what the govt wants all the time,that is let singapore labour's cost be competitive so that more foreign companies will want to come invest.So tell me that the present govt will actually now want to think of poor people? Yeh right,ask them help themselves,dun depend on the govt.<br><br>And b4 such a minimum rule will even be considered,the first thing that is actually needed is to increase back the CPF contribution rate to 20%,so many years has passed by with initial promises to increase it back has seen nothing being done so it already shows the govt is not willing to increase the cost of singapore labour and thus no chance for a minimum wage rule</div>

It's ad-hoc work with lump sum payment.
