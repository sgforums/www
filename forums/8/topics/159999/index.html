            <div class='col-md body'>A loosely translated and abridged version of the letter by a jobless PRC to ZaoBao forum page.<br><br>"Govt, Don't spoilt Singaporean" by GuoJingJing<br><br>Of late, there have been articles touching on employments and employablity, let me share my view as an outsider on this hotly debated topic. The govt has done many goods elevating living standards, wealth, comfort and health. However after living here for 2 years, I couldn't help but feel that<br>SINGAPOREANS HAVE BECOME A SPOILT LOTS.<br><br>In opening up the feedback channels, the govt has breed a culture of 'complain' in its citizens where every unreasonable, unjust, unpopular issues were hung out to dry in public. Like a bitching woman unsatisfied in very aspect of her life.<br><br>Why can't these people look farther and compare their livelihoods with that of China for example. Don't they know their quality of life is better than the Mainland Chinese by many folds. And what's there to be unsatified when the stuff you had is worth a person's yearly pay in China. Take the current employment figures, in order to boost jobs for locals, the govt has generated huge number of jobs, but WHY HASN'T THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IMPROVE FOR THEM?<br><br>LET ME TELL YOU, THAT IS BECAUSE SINGAPOREAN AREN'T HARD WORKING, NOT STRIVING TO LEARN TO IMPROVE THEIR SKILLSET.<br><br>You may feel I have prejudices and am too extreme, but this is a fact based on my personal experiences as a PRC student who have studied here. Perhaps I am not a graduate of top govt schools or renown university, or even a PR here, I all have is a PRC college degree and after earning a private degree here I thought I could stay on to put my talents to good use, but regrettably Singapore doesn't give me that chance, because I am a foreigner, a PRC citizen.<br><br>After 4 months of hopeless job searching, just when I was about to pack up and leave, I was offered a job. My joyfulness was snatched away from me when days after starting work, I was told by my company that they are unable to secure an employment pass for me and that "Singapore DON'T WELCOME PRC PEOPLE". Singapore has shown its true color to me.<br><br>The reason I think is that one more job for a PRC would mean one job less for Sporean. But this is unreasonable. I am doing what you Sporean didn't want to do. A newly hired female Sporean in the company quitted after working for a couple of days saying the job is too demanding. I don't have an answer when she asked me how I could put up with these demanding loads.<br><br>True, the work is tough and laborious and the PAY IS LOW for someone WHO HAS A MASTER DEGREE. I beared with it because the situation was only temporary and I believed my potential will shine and be noticed by top management. But alast, I have to go away, would not my leaving be a loss to the company and to Singapore?<br><br>Singapore need talents but opportunities are opened only to those from 'acceptable' universities, not to all who have talents. Foreign talents who graduated from privately run universities do not enjoy these opportunities. Isn't it a great loss to shut the doors on these capable people?<br>SINGAPOREANS ARE AN INSATIABLE BUNCH, BUT CAN THIS GOVT GIVE THEM ALL THEY ASKED FOR? WILL THEIR NEEDS EVER BE FULFILLED? What will this country be like in 10 years I cannot imagine. But the<br>golden rule of success will be that SUCCESS WILL BELONG TO THOSE WHO WORK HARD, STRIVE FOR PROGRESS, AND CAN BITE BITTER PILLS. This article is my own opinion and offer my sincere apology to those<br>I offended. - GuoJingJing<br><br></div>

I wonder if this is indirectly driving up production costs for Factories in Singapore, to be honest, the bunch of people with the best work ethics would be young malaysian men, the sort that lines up at the causeway at dawn every morning in their little honda scooters, hard working, conscientious, and don't mind getting their hands dirty at all .... if they had the paper qualifications to go along with their work ethics they would be very serious competition indeed ... it's a pity that they are constrained by their country's affirmative policies ....</div>
