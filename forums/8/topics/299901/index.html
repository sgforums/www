They also needs to call or sms their love ones back home. In Philippines, its very common to have a cellphones. Dun look down on them. I have a few church friends who are also maids here and some of them are graduates too. They come all the way here to work because back home in philippines, the income tax is as high as 40 percent. Everything is expensive to them. If you compare the price of milk and eggs, its more expensive in philippines.<br><br>Threat starter, pls do respect them. No one wants to work as a maid and being command here and there. Work as long as 18 hours. Sleep as little as 3 hours.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> </div></blockquote>I totally agree with you.<br><br>Maids are your helper, not your slave. They need to communicate with their love ones, family too.</div>
