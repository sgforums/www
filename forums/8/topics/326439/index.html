              <p>helping a friend ask: He owes credit card company a small amount of money which has been owed for a few months. He intends to pay it off this month end (he just found a job only) Because he so happened to changed his number and also gan qiao moved house (not because of the debt) he decide not to update the bank as he knows just awhile more he will be able to pay all he owes. Problem is..Will the debtor go to his company to look for him?? Its a new job, will they be able to find out where he work? Through what sources? CPF? Many Thanks.</p>

              <p><br>I think you should humble yourself if you're here for help.</p>
              <p>Simple solution to a simple problem - call up the bank, be frank 'bout the current situation and be sure to pay off the debt at the end of month. He can choose to update or not to update the bank regarding his change in address.</p>
              <p>And reddust hit the nail on the head on credit rating thingy, it does affect his credit rating to a certain extent. Maybe any bros' or sis' working in a bank could advise?</p>

              <p>It depends on the field of work he is in. Employers do conduct credit background checks so best to keep it good, and keep it stable. </p>
              <p>Regardless of whether it's safeguarding credibility or concern for face saving issues at work, he should still give credtors a call.</p>
              <p>I doubt the bank will call up his company on his very first month. Can't say the same for his second. Someone who works in a bank should be able to advise better. But I won't be surprised if they hire debt collecting agencies to do the deed.</p>
              <p>From what I know, with your IC number, most banks have access to all your credit information in all other banks locally, but no direct access to CPF contribution made to your account.</p>
              <p>Since he's going to pay up at the end of the month no matter what happens, why ignore the huge elephant and worry about what's going to happen? Might as well take control now, assess the toll it's taking, be upfront about how he plans to settle the debt before the next paycheck arrives.</p>
              <p>The last thing he needs now is accumulate more fines, interests and the most important thing is for him to take control of his own finances. Debts and bad habits snowball very easily and the last thing he wants is being backed into a difficult corner.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>redDust and detached are both spot on. Your friend needs to safeguard his credit rating. If I were you I'll advise him to make the best out of a shitty situation by protecting this credit. He'll never know if one day this credit will save his ass. </p>

              <p>I am working in a certain field that does debt collection for banks at times.</p>
              <p>Buttercake, when you mention small amount, how small is small?</p>
              <p>In fact, if your friend does not update the bank with his new address, put yourself in the bank's shoes, does it give you the impression that he is evading his debt?</p>
              <p>Banks are commercially-orientated, none of them likes to force people to the corner, what they concern is that they able to get the monie back. As Detached had mentioned, ask your friend to call up the bank and explain to the bank the situation. Sometimes if the 'small amount' you mention is not small, probably can negotiate to pay them in more installments but that of course you have to consider the interests that would be incurred.</p>
              <p>There are ways to find out where you stay if you moved house.</p>

              <p>if he cannot do a one time payment, the bank is happy to accept a one time payment of at least 50% of outstanding amount and the remainding balance can pay by installments (inclusive of interest) or wait 5 years, then the bank will be happy if he pay 50% of outstanding but the bank will outsource debt collectors to hound him.</p>

              <p>If it accumulated more than $10000. can declare a bankrupt. Once a person discharged from this bankruptcy, the record is going to be with the person for next</p>
              <p>six years. Bankruptcy mean the person only paid some amount of the debt, not the total amount of the debt. Debt collectors also need to adhere to regulation, they cannot simply suka2 go to person's house or office to pester the debtor, there is agrey area called harrasment.</p>

              <p>People, be mindful to always pay up your credit cards in full and on time every month.</p>
              <p>24%p.a. is huge!</p>
              <p>If you take $5000 and compound it for 25 years at 24% every year, you would have $1,082,709.96. Banks thrive on credit cards!</p>
              <p>As an investor, if I can compound my investments at close to 20% every year without fail, I would be sitting with the great investors of our time. eg. Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch, William O'Neil, George Soros...etc</p>
              <p>You only need 1 or 2 credit cards with you. I'm sure not everyone utilises all the services and discounts provided from their credit cards. Having more than that, you are just paying yearly credit card fees. Would be best if you call up and have it waived.</p>
              <p>Sometimes when I see people having multiple credit cards, I dont think that they are rich, just money tree for banks. A money conscious or a rich person wont have multiple cards with them. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"> Being rich starts from living within your means.</p>

              <p>Well said!</p>
              <p>That is why I always say "cash is king", I'd rather have an ultra fat wallet (like I always do <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">), do without the whatever services and discounts and be debtless at end of the month!</p>
