            <div class='col-md body'>I think only the minority actually try to avoid those nurses and doctors. Most are quite supportive.<br>I have another thinking, sometime I think is the nurse themselves being sensitive.<br>Something like when u do something wrong and if u see pp talking, u may feel that they are talking abt u.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yesterday, I had a lunch meeting with my client who is the regional manager for some projects in his company NPL Asia Pacific.  (Cannot reveal his company name here, so I shall use a fake name here)<br><br>This client is an angmoh.  NPL Asia Pacific is a MNC, with a few hundred to a thousand staff strength in the singapore office alone.<br><br>He just came back from his usual business trip to China and Hong Kong.  He went back to the office in Singapore and all his colleagues who are singaporeans told him to stay away.  At the same time, his friends, whom he has not seen in months, dropped him emails and sms asking him whether he was ok.<br><br>At the lunch table he told me that people from NPL Singapore office are so cold.  After this, he realised that these people are merely his colleagues, not friends.  He said that the damages has been done.  After the SARS crisis, he will treat them as colleagues only.<br><br>Thank goodness my boss and I had lunch with him one day after he came back from China.  I guess he really appreciates that.</div>
