(Cannot reveal his company name here, so I shall use a fake name here)<br><br>This client is an angmoh.  NPL Asia Pacific is a MNC, with a few hundred to a thousand staff strength in the singapore office alone.<br><br>He just came back from his usual business trip to China and Hong Kong.  He went back to the office in Singapore and all his colleagues who are singaporeans told him to stay away.  At the same time, his friends, whom he has not seen in months, dropped him emails and sms asking him whether he was ok.<br><br>At the lunch table he told me that people from NPL Singapore office are so cold.  After this, he realised that these people are merely his colleagues, not friends.  He said that the damages has been done.  After the SARS crisis, he will treat them as colleagues only.<br><br>Thank goodness my boss and I had lunch with him one day after he came back from China.  I guess he really appreciates that.</div></blockquote>cos his friends whom he has not seen in months are in electronic contact with him, no chance of getting anything from him, those in the office are in physical contact with him, if he kiao, they also got chance. . .</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I find asking nurses not to wear their uniform to and fro work is unfair becos the whole problem lies in the stupid mentality of some singaporeans.

I take MRT almost every day to work but I never encounter pp cover nose when pp cough...<br>I remember seeing people sitting next to a nurse when there are still seats oppsite. They never move away from her.<br>I think Sporean are not that kai si, at least we are not like the taiwanese rushing to buy cover, some ever when to buy those fake one when the real one run out of stock.<br>I believe there are only minority who are kai si.. and act foolishly.
