              <p>Hi</p>
              <p>This is my first year in polytechnic. Basically, I have no interest in the course though I'm doing very well in it. I'm planning to go JC next year and will be losing 1 precious year. I know it's a tough decision but it is better to dropout of the course if I have really no interest in it. </p>
              <p>Anyone who experience this situation, care to share your story with me?</p>
              <p>Mail me or anything if it is sensative to you. I feel quite sad about it as I do not wish to disappoint my parents in the future.</p>

              <p>do you know that if you can get a very high GPA/ dean's list, and then have a diploma with merit/ distinction, thereafter you apply for any relavant degree course in any of our public universities, you can directly get into 2nd year of the degree course as well?</p>
              <p>that means you will not lose any year in gap since you will "offset" the time when you compare this route to the JC route.</p>

              <p>Hi Dingda,</p>
              <p>I am in the same boat as you. I did quite well in a course that I have no interest in but I was able to perform. Probably worst than you, I don't even know what's my interest as I can't think of anything that interests me. I only know in which field that I can perform. I consulted many people too including my mum. </p>
              <p>So, I did complete my diploma and I was offered a place in NTU/NUS direct entry to 2nd year. But I am serving NS right now.  I do agree with rednano. You also have to remember that interest is something that you can nurture yourself with.</p>
              <p>Let make this simple:</p>
              <p>1. You complete your diploma - &gt; 2nd year relevant degree / 1st year your so called chosen degree of your interest.Total = 6 / 7 years.</p>
              <p>2. Dropout and go to JC -&gt; 1st year degree. Total: 7 years.</p>
              <p>The point is, even if you complete your diploma, you can still opt to choose other degree that is not relevant to your previous course provided that you did well.</p>
              <p>Going to JC does not guarentee a good future either. And let say if you did not score well in JC, what is your chances of going to uni?</p>
              <p>That's just my view la. No hurt feelings ya? :)</p>

              <p>Hi guys</p>
              <p>Thanks for sharing. I know an A level cert is useless but the admission of going to Uni is higher. I do not want to work after graduating from polytechnic (basically I don't like my course) </p>
              <p>Shadow08 </p>
              <p>I know the feeling of studying something that you don't really like. It really hurt me. Opening the lecture notes to study is like a pain for me. I'm landed in this situation because of my colorblind problem. I got kick out from my selected course which upset me. I got very sad quite often as I can't forget the past. This thing keep bringing up into my mind.</p>
              <p>Now, I am in IT school. I hate it much than my secondary school subjects so I think JC might be the best route for me now. I don't want to change to other course because I don't want to face the same problem again. Losing a year might be a painful experience for me but there is no option left as I need to study to succeed in my life.</p>
              <p>My parents are quite worried about me and I do not wish to disappoint them anymore. I don't know what should I do. </p>
              <p>I know Dip &gt; A level cert</p>
              <p>but I don't plan to work after graduating from poly. Do you think it is better for me to go JC now?</p>
              <p>I need more advice thank you.</p>

              <p>What type of IT course are you in? What is your GPA?<br><br> If i have no problem in doing well i will just continue with the course, the reason is because i know i am not a person who can score in subjects like English, Maths, Science, Chinese, etc..</p>
              <p>Usually in the second and third year, poly modules gets tougher, and you have to work harder just to maintain the same GPA you have, if you already have a high GPA for the first year, it's a good choice to continue maintaining it, because you will have a higher chance of getting into university with a high GPA.</p>
              <p>And most importantly, if you choose to continue your poly, you must not stop studying for your modules just because you have no interest, as that will cause your GPA to drop and lessen your chances of getting into local uni.</p>
              <p>I will continue the poly route, i feel that poly will give you more exposure than JC(correct me if im wrong). <br><br>Depending on your course, you may get to learn different softwares, different skills, meet different people, meet hot girls from other faculty, make friends with lecturers and ask them what they will most likely set for the exams.<br><br>I duno in JC, but for poly, if u are driving, you can drive out during breaks between classes to have lunch, drive girls go dating etc etc.</p>

              <p>I still think that you should not go to JC just because you are not interested in your current course. Since you are doing well, why not just complete the course and then choose a different course in uni? I personally think that its a was of time, energy and money to switch to JC. I don't think its worth it.</p>
              <p>What's your ideal course that might interest you by the way? If it is business, you can still study business while pursuing your main degree.</p>
              <p>In SP, if you did well during your 1st sem, you will be offered a diploma plus program. Which Poly are you from?</p>

              <p>Hi</p>
              <p>I know that this is a very difficult decision as I will be wasting a year. It is impossible to go back the past but to move forward. I was being kicked out of my desired course because of my vision problem ( colorblind). Hence i went into another course. I was quite upset and couldn't forget this stupid thing that happen onto me. </p>
              <p>Now, I don't really like my course. It is boring than my secondary school. I wonder how long can I hold on to this course. I know JC is hard and I might not be able to make it as my English is bad.</p>
              <p>But right now, I totally lost interest in studying my current course. Though I can force myself to study but I will not be happy for like 3 years. It is a sad thing to say. If I change to JC and did not do well for my A level, then i will be otally screwed as I do not have any future plan after that. </p>
              <p>If anyone face this situation, what will you do? You want to be happy in your life or you want to do something that you don't like in your life. Please advice me more.</p>
              <p>Thank you.</p>

              </p><p>Hi Tomas</p>
              <p>I'm a year 1 student. Currently, the subjects are quite basic and that's why I am able to do well for it. I'm not gifted or something. Basically, I'm trying to do well for it just to change course or school. If I do not have any options left, then I will stay in this course and do well for it reluctantly. Anyway if a student doesn't have interest in the course, doesn't mean he can't study and do well in exam. It is more like forcing yourself to study as you do not want to disappoint your parents. </p>
              <p>I know giving up halfway is not a good thing. By going to any courses or school, you can become a top student if you choose to grind and work hard to score well in order to enter a good university. Making yourself a top student doesn't mean you are happy. Though the achievement and the effort you put in might make you feel proud of it but it is impossible to be happy if you don't really like what you are studying.</p>

              <p>I feel sad for her. I know the risk and the danger of that... I also do not want to fall into her state but I am so called <span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;"><strong>é†’</strong></span><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;"><strong>ç›® </strong>already cause I don't even want to study in that course. I am a bit fuck up right now as I feel very helpless. My decision is so unclear right now because of my current situation. I believed that your friend must have suffered much.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">Anyway how much did she get for her O's? I am afraid that I might not be able to do well in JC too. The risk is much higher but I will be more happy while studying in JC more than polytechnic. I supposed it should be. In polytechnic, there's a lot of project work and assignments. I'm not the type who do project work and assignments but more of the studying type... If I change to JC next year, I might be wasting a year. From that 1 year that I have wasted, I will feel more passionate in my studies than being as playful as usual. </span></p>
