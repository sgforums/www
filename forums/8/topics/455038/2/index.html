              <p>Hey people...I'm a college student..Oh gosh this is the first time I'm hearing such a comment.In any case,this two years of college life will be very fast.</p>
              <p>The rigour of A level curriculum is definitely much higher than that of polytechnics considering the amount of knowledge we are getting within this short 1 and a half years period.Be prepared to be learning really advanced stuff and having tests frequently.Not to mention having fun with the 'amazing' project work which...yeah,you'll be having fun with it....Together with your other subjects to study as well as cca.:)</p>
              <p>My point here will be to consider your decision carefully as it is really not a child's play once you are there.Study,revise and homework are part of the everyday activities for most of us.</p>
              <p>So yeah,for those of you who are willing to take up the challenge....Welcome aboard!To the life of muggers where we share our stress with each other,haha.</p>
              <p>PS:Do read up on your own if you have the time.;)</p>

              <p>Ok heres my story</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ever since secondary school I have always been very academically driven and I always wanted to be the best. I was from normal academic because I didn't do well for PSLE and I was in an IJ school. Anyway for my n level I topped Sch w 6 points and O lvl I topped My school NA stream at 11 points R5 including CCA bonus. I went to poly because I thought I was sick of studying and that I wanted freedom.. Partly cos I have a bf and like I'm scared I can't cope if I went JC. But coming to poly.. I don't even like the system. I hate school and I just wanna be in uniform, studying math English lot and history. And econs is alright.. And I really really wanna get into a local u I don't even wanna consider overseas and I'm afraid poly education can't provide me with that. I really dunno what to do I'm lost as hell right now... I need help..</p>

              <p>Yeah I know JC is stressful and a diploma is better than an A level cert as well. The problem of me continuing this course is not a problem but I would prefer to study something more related to science and math. Though GP will be my weakest subject, I am willing to take up the challenge. Most of my friends are studying in JC and I am also afraid to lose my pride as they will be my senior afterall. It is kind of hard to decide as I am planning to enter a local university too.</p>
              <p>Anyway I'm facing the same situation as you as I do not like the polytechnic system too. It is kind of sad to waste a year... </p>

              <p>Since you have no interest in your course, where do you get the motivation to make yourself to step forward and continue in your studies. Losing a year will give me a big impact of my life. Fear will be instilled into my mind, losing faith in myself or rather losing the sense of pride due to the age gap. I have never made such a foolish mistake before. What done cannot be undone. I will be glad if you could share your experience or overcoming your point of interest. </p>
              <p>Thank you.</p>
