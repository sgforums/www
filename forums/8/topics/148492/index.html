            <div class='col-md body'>I think when both contestants went into final, they are equally good in their vocal skill. Unfortunately Weilian is blind. But I see that with him in this competition, is rare and very inspiring and motivating. I think people must'nt use the word "sympathy vote" on him.<br><br>1 real thing about Superstar in today's era to me is: "how long can they last in the singing market" ,ask yourself.<br><br>So who cares who gonna win and make money for others!<br><br>End of the day, I don't just vote base on the fact that who going to contribute more to help the music company make more money. Or rather who looks good and can attracts more attention and more marketable in future. Or who has more potential to go further in singing career. All this is too tangible things that we will always see. No dept !!!!<br><br>If Weilian wins, he is going to be giving an "intangible" social gift to many people in future. His winning will really inspire many people who are down and out in their lives to strive on. Weilian is a Superstar in my heart . He is what Chinese call ( can er bu fei )"Â²Ã�Â¶Ã¸Â²Â»Â·Ã�Â¡Â± . Initially I see him quite weird . But after hearing him and seeing him taking all steps to improve himself and making moving steps on stage just to create that touch with the audience. My heart numbed.<br><br>His song is also very touching . So much feeling .... So good. ..... He may not sound so good during the final as he is not feeling well. But overall he is very good .....<br><br>I personally got inspired by him and I tell myself if Weilian can do it in his singing career on stage, so can I be able to overcome all my personal problems now if I persist and perservere like him on stage. I must'nt give up so easily.<br><br>Anyway, Weilian can he be like (Ou De Yang) "Ã…Â·ÂµÃ‚Ã‘Ã¹Â¡Â± Â£Â¬singing behind the scene. Anyone has ever see our Ou De Yang real person singing on stage before ? I don't think so. Who knows if our Mr Ou is also a handicape ? Possible ?<br><br>So guys and gals, just cast your vote and don't comment too negatively. Just don't vote if you don't like.<br><br>Weilian ... You <strong>ADD-VALUES </strong>and <strong>inspire many lives </strong>if you are on stage ...<br>GO GO GO.. ...</div>
