            <div class='col-md body'>It had been ages since I set foot into the cafÃ©. Thus, it was with a strange heart that I entered into it and survey the surrounding. I was early, as evidenced by the number of people in it. There was no more malicious girl, husky voice girl and the tall and dark fellow by the corner. Most importantly of all, they clear the long coffee stain on the floor.<br><br>Â“Good morning sir, the usual this morning?Â” the waitress at the counter coons.<br>Â“But of course dearie, and make it extra foamy will you?Â” I replied with a large smile.<br>Yes, nothing like a big smile to start the day. I guess her PMS only appear much later in the day, either that or her boyfriend must have given her something-extra good today.<br>Â“It has been a long time since I last saw you sir, busy with your exams?Â” she continued while she steamed my latte extra foamy.<br>Â“Yes, although I think itÂ’s more of my laziness in stepping out of my house I am afraid.Â” I mentioned with a shame.<br>Â“HereÂ’s your latte!Â” as she laid my coffee on my tray nice and prim.<br><br>I walked to my favourite seat near the window, setting down my coffee and lay myself easy upon the big cushion chair. Letting out a sigh, I looked out of the window and watch all those human rats scuttling towards their holes and making their daily dollars and greed. Looks like I will have to join them soon. With a sip of my coffee, I declare the day started and proceed to cast my eyes at the door, waiting for the first customer to pop in.<br>The joy of coffee in the early morning cannot be underestimated!<br><br>------------------<br>The heartless and souless fool.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I thought there would be more people hanging out in the cafe, seeing that most people have already finisihed their exams. They probably lead more exciting lives, with other places to go on a beautiful day like this.<br><br>The 2 guys there before me seemed contented with their solitude, staring at life going by outside the window, with a few quick occasional glances at the waitress behind the counter.<br><br>I wonder if I can share their satisfaction in life. I was thinking about what I did throughout the year, and sad to say, it wasn't much. No adventures, no stories to share, didn't grow taller. I'm more of a creature of habit than I would admit. Take this cappacino for example. Its the only thing that I order. Ever. With all the fancy concoctions the cafe has to offer, I choose this every single time I come here. Should I transpose this monotony into my life as well?<br><br>I decide that I need to make life interesting for myself. I will have to make myself uncomfortable, otherwise a year from now I'll be sitting in this very chair regretting whatever I didn't do for the past twelve months. Without those 2 guys sitting here right now of course, because they would have done something exciting.<br><br>Change is good. Change is inevitable. Change is also bloody tough work. When the going gets tough, the tough gets going. Since I'm not tough, I'll change tomorrow.<br><br>[This message has been edited by pacman (edited 25 November 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"A hangover is the wrath of grapes" ~ Anonymous<br><br>As I drink my coffee, this phrase came straight to my mind. Truly, Mr Anonymous knows what he is talking about and I would further add to it, that a good morning is the love of beans. Or make that beans with a lot of milk thrown in for good measures.<br><br>Ah, I can see the crowd streaming in now. So, the dark and brooding man is back as usual and giving me the look through and through. Seems like he is attributing something to me, that he can sense what my mind is going through when I look out of the window. Wonder if he works for the 1900 Psychic Hotline. Talking about 1900, that fellow in the dark corner drinking his dark chocolate seems to find it envious that the waitress knew me on a first name basis. Oh well, wait till he experiences her PMS mood first hand, her cute ponytail not withstanding.<br><br>John Donne mentioned in his poem that Â“I loves a woman who loves me notÂ” How true it is. 2 truism in a day sure makes for deja vu feelings. When the exams are over, and when the seasons of jolly are close, I feel depress. Like a good tag teams in the WWF, both love and depression had me in a submission move and are now waiting to deal me their famous Â“holiday stunnerÂ” tag action. Tsk tsk, love and depressionÂ…they sure go hand in hand. Time to pass tag to my partner Mr Latte. He will help me out of this submission move.<br><br>The way I see it, I can only have my dear coffee when Christ and all his merriment falls upon my poor soul. End of millennium celebration? How aptÂ…to celebrate the end of love for me too.<br><br>------------------<br>The heartless and souless fool.</div>
