            <div class='col-md body'>Barclays,<br><br>Let me go one further. I HAVE applied for a job as a SIA steward. Unfortunately sexism in our beloved service-with-a-smile national carrier is as rampant as a rapist in a harem.<br><br>And lest you all think IÂ’m an ugly ill-mannered troll (well two out of three ainÂ’t bad) this is what I had to offer. Just under 6 ft, my skills include plastic smiles, blatant ignoring of customers, finger-pointing, Singapore bashing and a well-worked Â‘I dunch knowÂ’ routine. Shoo in right? Noooooo. Missing the fine-print I later realised well-slicked hair, being conversant with make-up, slight effectuality and actual work were required!  That signalled the end of my sashaying days. (Ok, ok, IÂ’m just bored, I never applied.)<br><br>Post-structualism? At last a fellow Derrida, Foucault and Lyotard fan. Know the differAnce between SIA and Virgin?
