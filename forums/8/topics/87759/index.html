            <div class='col-md body'>Project: Senso, an Asian Entrepreneurship Community has launched a Community Initiative in 2004 called the Pledge A Book Movement. It is an initiative that seeks to help 3 groups of people in one collective Movement that spans a year of planning, executing and deployment. The Pledge A Book Movement takes the normal used textbooks collection exercise and adds on top of it a business structure and socially responsible activities in order to instill and inspire both volunteers and beneficiaries. This movement is unlike any other due to it's unique capability of blending Business, Community and Charity initiatives all into one comprehensive movement that DOES NOT give people fishes but much rather teach them to fish while simultaneously giving them self-worth.<br><br>The core beneficiaries are poor families but instead of helping them in the conventional "begger" mentality way where they are given things for free, an initiative to encourage them to "pay it forward" in kind rather than in cash is to instill within them self-worth, where they can learn that even though they may not be rich monentarily they do have the greatest asset which is TIME and EFFORT.<br><br>The sub beneficiaries would be the Volunteer Work Organizations that tie up with the Pledge A Book Movement as they would be able to possibly harvest new volunteers (the primary beneficiaries) into their organisation. The other sub beneficiaries include Pertapis Children Home of which all proceeds from this moment will be donated (after minusing operating cost) at the end of the year.<br><br>The final beneficiaries are the Volunteers and Student organizers. They would be guided by entrepreneurs and business people on the skills of how to run a Singapore-wide virtual logistics company while being instilled in the values of a socially responsible individual and potential entrepreneur.<br><br>Details on this Movement can be seen on http://pab.projectsenso.com and at this moment we are seeking volunteers in the areas of Marketing and Sector Management (South West sector) and we are open to any volunteers in any other form. Please kindly contact me at 94889683, Nicholas here or email Andy the Project Head at andylim@projectsenso.com for any queries. Thank you!<br><br>PS. All leftover books and materials would most probably be passed on to SIF-Cambodia School Expedition (or any others that may need them)</div>
