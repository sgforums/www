            <div class='col-md body'>Thats the problem with our laws.  Even if we are provoked and we get physical, we are still in the wrong.  There is no way to argue that we were provoked into it and we didn't start it all (this is possible some other places).<br><br>And some people know this and thus behave anyway the want by provoking others, knowing that they're safe.<br><br>Remember the case at Zouk a few months back?  This guy pushed an airforce pilot.  The airforce pilot then lost his temper whacked the guy.  The airforce pilot was sentenced to something like a year's jail.  Sh1t, what are we supposed to do when provoked, even pushed by someone?  Say thank you and walk away????<br><br>The way things are now, I could sit around a public area and curse you, your ancestory and your descendents and you could do nothing to me.  If you walk away to call the police, I'll walk away.  If you curse me back, I'll curse you more and it'll be an endless exchange of words.  If you whack me, I'll report to the police and you go to jail.<br><br>I say that we should punish the one who provokes only.  Then I think everyone will be more careful about the way they behave.<br><br></div>
