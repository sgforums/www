              <p>At the outset, I must declare have great admiration for Prof Tommy Koh and believe in his compassion for the mainstream of spore and his love for the country.  However, I also feel obligated to give my view what the more important problem is.  My language might be more direct and less diplomatic and I do not want to hurt any one.  My responses are in red:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Tahoma; font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span dir="ltr">IT IS a sad reflection on human nature that when a region is faced with a crisis, it is oô€„žen treated<br> with disdain instead of sympathy. I recall that during the Asian financial crisis of 1997â€�1998, some<br> of our European and American friends were extremely unkind and predicted that Asia would<br> suffer a lost decade.This is just being in the real 
              world with real human nature especially the revengeful nature.  Many 
              asians have felt bullied during colonisation and during the asian crisis
               lecture.  Same as the chinese-educated sporeans
              and those who got put away by the pap are now seeking revenge.<br> We must not do the same to Europe which has been faced with a serious financial and economic<br> crisis since 2008. I have, therefore, decided to swim against the tide of antiâ€�Europe sentiments.<br> I wish to highlight the fact that not all the countries of Europe are in crisis. Last year, of the 27<br> European Union countries, only three had a negative growth rate. In the 2010â€�2011 Global<br> Competitiveness Index of the World Economic Forum, six EU countries were ranked among the<br> 10 most competitive countries.Global competitiveness is I believed ranked by businesses(MNCs) and EU has a good share of international companies.  I am just saying we should bear this in mind.  Global competitiveness
              is about how attractive to businesses which is not all about govts.  Govts is more than just business friendly<br> I wish to make the case that Singapore has much to learn from the successful countries of Europe.<br> I will focus on four European countries whose populations are below 10 million – namely,<br> Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden.Sure we should learn the right lessions from any one.<br> LESSON NO. 1<br> Inclusive growth<br> THE citizens of the world aspire to live in fair societies. One important aspect of fairness is the<br> equitable distribution of income and wealth. This is the moral force behind the economic doctrine<br> of inclusive growth. As a result of globalisation, technological change and domestic policies, many<br> countries have become extremely unequalTrue govts and 
              their peoples must strive for fairness and justice.  However, in 
              reality, politics are most greatly influenced by the top 0.5% because 
              money comes ultimately from these top 0.5% and for
              this reason there is no real democracy in any country before and now and
               in the future. With control coming from the 
              top 0.5%, it is silly to think real fairness and justice to be 
              achievable if these top 0.5% do not believe in the same
              lattitude of fairness and justice.  The rich and poor divide has been 
              around since civilisation and now with printing of money by the private 
              sectors in obscene amount thru financial engg, the divide got worse.  Globalisation only spread the top 0.5% 
              influence to more countries and not so much
              the magnitude.<br> <br> The Occupy Wall Street movement is a reflection of the American people’s sentiments against a<br> growth model which overâ€�rewards the top 1 per cent and underâ€�rewards the remaining 99 per<br> cent.This movement is wrong in saying top 1% - actually top 0.5% because those earning more than US$500k then is really powerful The inequality in Singapore, as measured by the Gini coefficient, is even greater than that in<br> America. Too great a gap between rich and poor undermines solidarity and social cohesion. It<br> poses a threat to our harmony and our sense of nationhood.True   Actually, It is great shame for US to have  such high Gini coefft because
               US is a big country that does not have to rely on export and can 
              maintain 
              even more income distribution like EU countries.  I feel US coeff could 
              be higher if they have included the low wage of the illegal latino 
              workers from neighbouring countries. For better solidarity and social cohesion, the bottom 20%
              must also have better attitude and not parasitic - it takes 2 to clap. Just a few days ago, Australia will also be allow 12k people from the PNG, pacific islands to work as fruit and vegetable pickers.<br> Let us compare Singapore, on the one hand, and Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden on the<br> other. Their per capita incomes in 2010 were as follows:<br> Singapore: S$59,813<br> Denmark: S$69,249(€42,500)<br> Finland: S$54,584 (€33,500)<br> Norway: S$105,096 (€64,500)Spore could achieve this 
              per capita income only thru attracting many cos to operate here and lift
               external economy to 4 times of domestic economy in good times.  These 4
               countries enjoy the benefits of EU without
              the need to resort to use this strategy.<br> Sweden: S$60,613 (€37,200)<br> The Gini coefficient is used universally as a summary measure of equality. It is based<br> upon the difference between the incomes of the top 20 per cent and the boô€„´om 20 per cent. ZeroGini
               coefficient should measure the difference btwn the incomes of top 0.5%
               and the bottom 20%.  Measuring the difference between top 20 and bottom
              20 conceals the real problem of the real drivers of politics and economy
               of the top 0.5%.  Ceo could take  only 2 days to make a graduate make $2m in his whole life career.  Ceos incomes could keep going up simply by just keeping outsourcing to low cost countries - does not speak of much talent at all.  Top 20% is only the equivalent of senior mgrs.<br> represents total income equality and one represents total inequality. What are the Gini<br> coefficients of the five countries? In 2010, they were as follows:<br> Singapore: 0.46<br> Denmark: 0.27<br> Finland: 0.25<br> Norway: 0.24<br> Sweden: 0.24<br> In order to get a beô€„´er sense of the wages earned in the five countries by the boô€„´om 20â€�30 per<br> cent of the working population, I have chosen the cleaner and the bus driver. The average<br> monthly wages of the cleaner and bus driver in the five countries are as follows:<br> Singapore<br> Cleaner S$800 Bus driver S$1,800What is important to 
              note is that these 2 occupations are held mainly by foreigners because slightly more than 1
               in every 5 (going to 1 in 4) are grads<br> Denmark<br> Cleaner S$5,502 Bus driver S$6,193I know Prof Koh 
              probably think it is not just to bring in citizenship for the same 
              job in the same country - same legal rights <br> Finland<br> Cleaner S$2,085 Bus driver S$3,910The large difference
               is typical of non export countries who does not need to bring in cheap 
              labour. their cos just produce them in low cost countries if necessary.<br> Norway<br> Cleaner S$5,470 Bus driver S$6,260<br> Sweden<br> Cleaner S$3,667 Bus driver S$4,480<br> A few observations are in order.<br> First, Singapore’s per capita income is roughly similar to those of Denmark, Finland and Sweden.Prof
               Koh forgets to point out that these 4 countries are enjoying the 
              benefits of being under EU whereas Spore cannot successfully enjoy under
              the Msia and Indonesia umbrella.  Spore achieves similar income thru 
              having an external economy 4 times its internal economy.<br> Second, the four Nordic countries are much more equitable than Singapore. This is reflected in<br> their Gini coefficients as well as in the average monthly wages earned by the cleaner and the bus<br> What Singapore can learn from Europe By Tommy Koh « SG Hard Truth 
              http://sghardtruth.wordpress.com/2012/05/19/what-singapore-can-learn...<br> 2 of 6 19/05/2012 7:03 PM<br> driver.Within these 4 nordic countries they are 
              serving their own people and people of EU mainly and so much less 
              pressure to adopt low cost centres.  If need be, their cos could operate
               in the low cost countries.  Singapore do not have mncs
              and at most regional cos, the rest are mncs coming to spore to exploit 
              free talent and capital flow under reasonable cost environment. <br> Third, some Nordic countries have a minimum wage and some, such as Denmark, do not. The<br> minimum wage is, therefore, a means but not the only means to ensure that workers earn a living<br> wage.Top 0.5% can easily overcome this rule easily if 
              they want.  Maintain thing for spore is also now whether those 
              professionals and above willing to forgo a large part of their salaries 
              to top up the bottom 20% - somebody has to pay or
              at least share to pay because the top 0.5%  are definitely unwilling to 
              bear all.  Govt only has some investment income and most income comes 
              from taxes - so spore govt could only top up some for the bottom 20%. I 
              shall leave it to you to think which is possible. 
              If it is not possible why need to discuss whether this is fair or not?<br> Fourth, the argument that the only way to raise the wages of our lowâ€�wage workers is through<br> productivity increase is not persuasive. I would like to know, for example, how the two women<br> who clean my office can be more productive than they already are in order to deserve higher<br> wages? I would like to know how the Singapore bus driver can be more productive so that his<br> income will approximate those of his Nordic counterparts?The
               govt was just echoing what the top 0.5% are asking in return for pay 
              increase and certainly it is true that the large difference in pay 
              cannot be make up by productivity increases. 
              Obviously in the corporate world, it is up to the top 0.5% to say 
              whether they want to pay how much, to recruit you or whether you are 
              qualified or not.  Whereas, the top 0.5% have the right to decide how 
              much to pay themselves because their pay are decided
              by fellow top 0.5% who takes pride in saying talents are scarce and they
               put themselves as talents which are not obviously always the case - 
              they have the money their words become rules and facts.<br> The truth is that we pay these workers such low wages not primarily because their productivity is<br> inherently low, but largely because they are competing against an unlimited supply of cheap<br> foreign workers. Because cheap workers are so plentiful, they tend to be employedTrue,
               but all emerging mkts in order to move up must offer cheap cost of 
              operations first and especially spore is so small with no hinterland.<br> unproductively. In the Nordic countries, unskilled workers are relatively scarce and thus deployed<br> more productively, with higher skills, mechanisation, and beô€„´er organisation.The
               vast difference in pay cannot be made up by upgrading or automation - 
              it has to come from the hearts of the top 0.5% and whether the top 20% 
              want to share the
              burden or not.<br> What is the solution? The solution is for the State to reduce the supply of cheap foreign workers<br> or introduce a minimum wage or to target specific industries, such as the hospitality industry, for<br> wage enhancement.As explained above, these 2 solutions
               are not possible.  One, 200k maids could be reduced to only families of
               handicaps/aged parents but these people would have to pay huge cost - 
              who is going to help them.  The 1million foreign
              labours consist of construction workers and cleaners are more 
              difficult.  OK we can stop construction since we are quite built up.  
              But for cleaners impossible because sporeans are dirty irresponsible 
              habits compared to western people. Western countries they
              do not have much cleaners and so few bins and yet so clean and tidy.  
              Asians are bad in this respect - so who can change this behaviour and 
              culture?  Not possible.  For those manual labours in ship building etc 
              ok they can shift overseas causing sporeans in
              supervisory and managerial positions jobless.  No need for plumbers and 
              electricians and mechanics as people have to DIY - those cannot pay the 
              high price - plausible.<br> LESSON NO. 2<br> Higher fertility<br> ONE of our challenges is our low fertility rate. For a country’s population to remain stable, it<br> needs a total fertility rate (TFR) of 2.14. Singapore’s current TFR is 1.2. Our population experts tell  <br> us that our population will begin to shrink by 2025. They have, therefore, argued that, to make up<br> the deficit, we need to import foreigners to add to our population.<br> Importing foreigners is the second best solution. The best solution is to raise our TFR. On this<br> point, our policymakers seem to have run out of ideas. The various incentive schemes, such as<br> baby bonus, do not seem to be productive. It is time to look at our four European countries for<br> inspiration. Their 2010 TFRs were as follows:<br> Denmark: 1.87<br> Finland: 1.87<br> Norway: 1.95<br> Sweden: 1.98As long as they are not at displacement 
              level, it only says they take longer time to face the problem in spite 
              of putting in so huge cost into it.<br> The four Nordic countries have TFRs which are close to the replacement level. This achievement<br> seems extraordinary. They do not have the benefit of maids. There are over 200,000 foreign<br> domestic workers in Singapore. They also do not have grandparents who help with childâ€�rearing.<br> At the same time, they have very high participation of women in their workforces. In terms of<br> availability of time and help for childâ€�rearing, common sense would suggest that the TFR in<br> Singapore should be higher than those in the Nordic countries. How do we explain this paradox?It
               is not so much about availability of time and help for child-rearing as
               Prof Koh has pointed out.  I feel the most critical point is sporeans
              have experienced the large familly burden and loss of freedom to 
              enjoying burden free small families thru nation-wide birth control 
              whereas none of the advanced countries  experience that.  It is natural 
              for them to have big families in general because they
              have not gone thru nation-wide popn control.  They tend to love animals 
              and hence children beside some religious support(catholicism). When a 
              nation(not just a few or some or many) experience the impact of good 
              live it is very difficullt to go back to more
              disciplined life like less travelling.<br> Our population experts cannot explain this paradox. I will venture a hypothesis. I believe that the<br> high TFR in the Nordic countries could be due to four factors: the availability of convenient,<br> affordable and good childcare; good workâ€�life balance; an excellent and relatively stressâ€�free<br> education system; and the relative absence of male chauvinism.These 4 factors are by no means easy for spore to transit to and yet their results still fall short of replacement level.<br> Let me say a few words on each of the four factors.<br> First, one of the missing links in Singapore is the inadequate supply of conveniently located, good<br> quality and affordable childcare for infants and young children.To
               be able to afford this, much higher pay or govt must foot the bills.  
              In Perth, a migrant accountant could only afford to send their kids for 3
               days a week to childcare - I
              learn personally.<br> Second, the workâ€�life balance in Singapore, especially for many young professionals such as<br> lawyers, architects and teachers, is poor. Singaporeans work one of the longest hours in the<br> developed world. They have liô€„´le energy for life other than work and thus liô€„´le time forNot all professionals are busy and those who are free are not having babies too<br> meaningful family life.<br> The Government and our employers should reflect on whether the existing climate of<br> encouraging or requiring our young professionals to work late into the night is necessary or<br> desirable.Please note it is still the top 0.5%'s control.  Sometimes the employees are to be blamed because they want to excel.<br> Third, sociologists like Paulin Straughan have pointed out that Singapore’s highly competitive andThis
               is purely sociologists' imagination.  I feel it is the parents' 
              decision not really the education system.  In Perth, those sporeans 
              migrated
              because they want to give their children a stress free education and 
              work put their children in costly private schools because they want 
              their children to learn more what the public schools do not teach.  In 
              Kumon Perth, those who send their kids for enrichment
              classes are all mainly asians.  Actually, spore schools std are now 
              quite unform and provide eca and volunteering to students making 
              competition fairer to the poorer students.  Just imagine if the schools 
              do not provide this, those from middle income families
              and above would be sending their kids to enrichment courses and tuition 
              etc - making the competition less equal.  If the students are like 
              western countries and yet they cannot have boy-girl relationships at 
              young age then most of the childhood time would be
              spent on internet - as it is now asian kids spend most time on computer 
              than western kids - I believe is because they believe in boy-girl 
              socialisation on top of sports.<br> stressful education system is also a deterrent to working parents having more children. The<br> Nordic countries, on the other hand, are famous for their high quality, egalitarian education<br> which fulfils the children’s aspiration for a happy childhood. It is a paradox that Finland, with no<br> streaming, no elite schools and no private tuition industry, is ranked as having the world’s best<br> education system.I always think because Finland is a 
              cold country(less sunshine) with nothing much to do and so have least 
              distractions than spore kids.  In any case, spore education achieve less
               variability in std in the world but are not
              that stellar on the top end.  Private tuition cannot raise std because 
              they simplify the students' learning experience and make them more lazy 
              and have more time to play - I know professionals do not  think this way
               but I know I am right about this.  I see
              so many RJC and HC students in Perth (excellent O and <br> A) but cannot have the passion to beat caucasions where whites only face
               one national exam in year 12 because they want to go univ.  RJC and HC students learn more than A-Lvll but do not appear the head 
              start eventually make any difference
              to the degree results because they are less passionate in learning.  
              Perhaps in local univers, the same thing happens and jealousy over 
              foreign students become worse. <br> Fourth, it is significant that the developed countries with low TFRs include Japan, Korea, Italy<br> and Spain, which have a high degree of male chauvinism. Is it possible that Singapore too has a<br> high degree of male chauvinism? The women of Singapore are oô€„žen blamed for not marrying and<br> having children. Perhaps, the main problem is not our women but our men. Perhaps, what we<br> also need is a mindset change on the part of our men towards the status and role of our women<br> and the shared responsibilities of the husband and wife, and father and mother in domestic<br> chores and childâ€�rearing.Of course, this male chauvinism is difficult to change - asian culture.<br> LESSON NO. 3<br> Embracing nature and sustainable development<br> SINGAPORE is probably Asia’s cleanest, greenest and most liveable city. Our air is healthy, our<br> water is potable and our land is wholesome. In addition, we enjoy good public health and food<br> safety. Visitors are astonished by the fact that, in spite of our high density, 47 per cent of our land<br> is covered in greenery. In view of this, the reader will ask what can we learn from the four Nordic<br> countries? I suggest three things.<br> First, people there love nature and their natural heritage. They seem to have an emotional, even a<br> spiritual, relationship with nature. They love their forests, lakes and ô€„¦ords. In contrast, most<br> Singaporeans tend to have a more pragmatic relationship with nature. They apply a costâ€�benefit<br> analysis to the destruction of a natural heritage. Pragmatism is one of our virtues. We should,<br> however, be aware of the defects of our virtues. Not everything in life can be monetised.<br> Second, we can learn useful lessons from the way in which the Nordic countries have been able<br> to reconcile economic competitiveness with a deep commitment to sustainable development.<br> Aô€„žer the 1992 Earth Summit, each of them has established a national commission to mainstream<br> sustainable development.<br> In the case of Finland, the Prime Minister chairs the National Commission on Sustainable<br> Development. The result is that there is a national consensus in each of those countries to<br> internalise the ethic of sustainable development into all aspects of life.<br> Third, at the microâ€�level, there are lessons in areas where Singapore has room for improvement –<br> for example, in energy efficiency, the use of solar energy, the recycling of waste, the use of<br> nonâ€�polluting buses, changing unsustainable paô€„´erns of consumption and production, etc.<br> LESSON NO. 4<br> Heritage, culture and the arts<br> IN THE past two decades, inspired by the 1989 Ong Teng Cheong report and Mr George Yeo’s<br> leadership at the then Ministry of Information and the Arts, Singapore has undergone a paradigm<br> shiô€„ž in the areas of heritage, culture and the arts. The arts have blossomed. More and more<br> Singaporeans are interested in knowing their history and preserving their heritage. The trend is,<br> therefore, favourable. What can we learn from the Nordic countries?<br> First, we can learn the importance of giving all our children a good education in the arts. We have<br> made good progress in recent years. The opening of the Yong Siew Toh Conservatory of Music<br> and the School of The Arts were important milestones.<br> We can strengthen arts education in our schools. We should consider starting courses in art<br> history and museum studies at the undergraduate and graduate levels. This will help in the<br> training of teachers, curators, dealers, collectors and museum administrators, all in short supply.<br> Second, we can emulate the achievements of the Nordic countries in respect of museums. They<br> have an impressive range of museums with strong collections. They have been able to harness the<br> benefit of publicâ€�private partnership. Their museum collections extend beyond their nations to<br> the cultures of the world.<br> For example, the David Collection in Copenhagen is one of the world’s best collections of Islamic<br> Art. The Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art in Helsinki has a very ambitious programming<br> agenda, covering Western as well as Asian and African art.<br> Third, because of their ancient Viking past and current strength in shipping and other maritime<br> industries, Denmark, Norway and Sweden have outstanding museums of maritime history.<br> Given the importance of maritime trade to Singapore’s past and present, it is puzzling that we do<br> not have a museum of maritime history. I hope one day the historic Clifford Pier, which now<br> houses a restaurant, will be the home of a worldâ€�class museum of maritime history. When that<br> time comes, we can look to the Nordic countries for inspiration.Embrace
               nature is good but arts are for the rich.  I do not find myself a 
              misfit in society just because I could not appreciate art or olympics.  
              What is more important that the
              top 0.5% has a far more compassionate in not seeking breaking records of
               earnings because earnings are determined by them .<br> By Tommy Koh, For The Straits Times, May 19, 2012</span></span></span></p>

              <p>At the outset, I must declare have great admiration for Prof
                                      Tommy Koh and believe in his compassion for the mainstream of spore
                                      and his love for the country.  However, I also feel obligated
                                      to give my view what the more important problem is.  My
                                      language might be more direct and less diplomatic and I do not want
                                      to hurt any one.  My responses are in red:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Tahoma; font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span>IT IS a sad reflection on human nature
                                      that when a region is faced with a crisis, it is oô€„žen treated<br> with disdain instead of sympathy. I recall that during the Asian
                                      financial crisis of 1997â€�1998, some<br> of our European and American friends were extremely unkind and
                                      predicted that Asia would<br> suffer a lost decade.<span style="color: #ff0000;">This is just being in the real world with real
                                      human nature especially the revengeful nature.  Many asians
                                      have felt bullied during colonisation and during the asian crisis
                                      lecture.  Same as the chinese-educated sporeans and those who
                                      got put away by the pap are now seeking revenge.</span><br> We must not do the same to Europe which has been faced with a
                                      serious financial and economic<br> crisis since 2008. I have, therefore, decided to swim against the
                                      tide of antiâ€�Europe sentiments.<br> I wish to highlight the fact that not all the countries of Europe
                                      are in crisis. Last year, of the 27<br> European Union countries, only three had a negative growth rate. In
                                      the 2010â€�2011 Global<br> Competitiveness Index of the World Economic Forum, six EU countries
                                      were ranked among the<br> 10 most competitive countries.Global competitiveness is <span style="color: #ff0000;">I believed
                                      ranked by businesses(MNCs) and EU has a good share of international
                                      companies.  I am just saying we should bear this in
                                      mind.  Global competitiveness is about how attractive to
                                      businesses which is not all about govts.  Govts is more than
                                      just business friendly</span><br> I wish to make the case that Singapore has much to learn from the
                                      successful countries of Europe.<br> I will focus on four European countries whose populations are below
                                      10 million – namely,<br> Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden.Sure we should learn the right
                                      lessions from any one.<br> LESSON NO. 1<br> Inclusive growth<br> THE citizens of the world aspire to live in fair societies. One
                                      important aspect of fairness is the<br> equitable distribution of income and wealth. This is the moral
                                      force behind the economic doctrine<br> of inclusive growth. As a result of globalisation, technological
                                      change and domestic policies, many<br> countries have become extremely unequal<span style="color: #ff0000;">True govts and their peoples
                                      must strive for fairness and justice.  However, in reality,
                                      politics are most greatly influenced by the top 0.5% because money
                                      comes ultimately from these top 0.5% and for this reason there is
                                      no real democracy in any country before and now and in the future.
                                      With control coming from the top 0.5%, it is silly to think real
                                      fairness and justice to be achievable if these top 0.5% do not
                                      believe in the same lattitude of fairness and justice.  The
                                      rich and poor divide has been around since civilisation and now
                                      with printing of money by the private sectors in obscene amount
                                      thru financial engg, the divide got worse.  Globalisation only
                                      spread the top 0.5% influence to more countries and not so much the
                                      magnitude</span>.<br> <br> The Occupy Wall Street movement is a reflection of the American
                                      people’s sentiments against a<br> growth model which overâ€�rewards the top 1 per cent and
                                      underâ€�rewards the remaining 99 per<br> cent.<span style="color: #ff0000;">This movement is wrong in saying top 1% - actually top 0.5%
                                      because those earning more than US$500k then is really powerful The
                                      inequality in Singapore, as measured by the Gini coefficient, is
                                      even greater than that in</span><br> America. Too great a gap between rich and poor undermines
                                      solidarity and social cohesion. It<br> poses a threat to our harmony and our sense of
                                      nationhood.True   <span style="color: #ff0000;">Actually, It is great shame for US to
                                      have  such high Gini coefft because US is a big country that
                                      does not have to rely on export and can maintain  even more
                                      income distribution like EU countries.  I feel US coeff could
                                      be higher if they have included the low wage of the illegal latino
                                      workers from neighbouring countries. For better solidarity and
                                      social cohesion, the bottom 20% must also have better attitude and
                                      not parasitic - it takes 2 to clap. Just a few days ago, Australia
                                      will also be allow 12k people from the PNG, pacific islands to work
                                      as fruit and vegetable pickers.</span><br> Let us compare Singapore, on the one hand, and Denmark, Finland,
                                      Norway and Sweden on the<br> other. Their per capita incomes in 2010 were as follows:<br> Singapore: S$59,813<br> Denmark: S$69,249(€42,500)<br> Finland: S$54,584 (€33,500)<br> Norway: S$105,096 (€64,500)<span style="color: #ff0000;">Spore could achieve this per capita
                                      income only thru attracting many cos to operate here and lift
                                      external economy to 4 times of domestic economy in good
                                      times.  These 4 countries enjoy the benefits of EU without the
                                      need to resort to use this strategy.</span><br> Sweden: S$60,613 (€37,200)<br> The Gini coefficient is used universally as a summary measure of
                                      equality. It is based<br> upon the difference between the incomes of the top 20 per cent and
                                      the boô€„´om 20 per cent. Zero<span style="color: #ff0000;">Gini coefficient should measure the
                                      difference btwn the incomes of top 0.5% and the bottom 20%. 
                                      Measuring the difference between top 20 and bottom 20 conceals the
                                      real problem of the real drivers of politics and economy of the top
                                      0.5%.  Ceo could take  only 2 days to make a graduate
                                      make $2m in his whole life career.  Ceos incomes could keep
                                      going up simply by just keeping outsourcing to low cost countries -
                                      does not speak of much talent at all.  Top 20% is only the

                                      inequality. What are the Gini<br> coefficients of the five countries? In 2010, they were as
                                      follows:<br> Singapore: 0.46<br> Denmark: 0.27<br> Finland: 0.25<br> Norway: 0.24<br> Sweden: 0.24<br> In order to get a beô€„´er sense of the wages earned in the five
                                      countries by the boô€„´om 20â€�30 per<br> cent of the working population, I have chosen the cleaner and the
                                      bus driver. The average<br> monthly wages of the cleaner and bus driver in the five countries
                                      are as follows:<br> Singapore<br> Cleaner S$800 Bus driver S$1,800<span style="color: #ff0000;">What is important to note is that
                                      these 2 occupations are held mainly by foreigners because slightly

                                      Denmark, Finland and Sweden.<span style="color: #ff0000;">Prof Koh forgets to point out that
                                      these 4 countries are enjoying the benefits of being under EU
                                      whereas Spore cannot successfully enjoy under the Msia and
                                      Indonesia umbrella.  Spore achieves similar income thru having
                                      an external economy 4 times its internal economy.</span><br> Second, the four Nordic countries are much more equitable than
                                      Singapore. This is reflected in<br> their Gini coefficients as well as in the average monthly wages
                                      earned by the cleaner and the bus<br> <br> driver.<span style="color: #ff0000;">Within these 4 nordic countries they are serving their own
                                      people and people of EU mainly and so much less pressure to adopt
                                      low cost centres.  If need be, their cos could operate in the
                                      low cost countries.  Singapore do not have mncs and at most
                                      regional cos, the rest are mncs coming to spore to exploit free
                                      talent and capital flow under reasonable cost environment.</span><br> Third, some Nordic countries have a minimum wage and some, such as
                                      Denmark, do not. The<br> minimum wage is, therefore, a means but not the only means to
                                      ensure that workers earn a living<br> wage.<span style="color: #ff0000;">Top 0.5% can easily overcome this rule easily if they
                                      want.  Maintain thing for spore is also now whether those
                                      professionals and above willing to forgo a large part of their
                                      salaries to top up the bottom 20% - somebody has to pay or at least
                                      share to pay because the top 0.5%  are definitely unwilling to
                                      bear all.  Govt only has some investment income and most
                                      income comes from taxes - so spore govt could only top up some for
                                      the bottom 20%. I shall leave it to you to think which is
                                      possible.  If it is not possible why need to discuss whether
                                      this is fair or not?</span><br> Fourth, the argument that the only way to raise the wages of our
                                      lowâ€�wage workers is through<br> productivity increase is not persuasive. I would like to know, for
                                      example, how the two women<br> who clean my office can be more productive than they already are in
                                      order to deserve higher<br> wages? I would like to know how the Singapore bus driver can be
                                      more productive so that his<br> income will approximate those of his Nordic counterparts?<span style="color: #ff0000;">The govt
                                      was just echoing what the top 0.5% are asking in return for pay
                                      increase and certainly it is true that the large difference in pay
                                      cannot be make up by productivity increases.  Obviously in the
                                      corporate world, it is up to the top 0.5% to say whether they want
                                      to pay how much, to recruit you or whether you are qualified or
                                      not.  Whereas, the top 0.5% have the right to decide how much
                                      to pay themselves because their pay are decided by fellow top 0.5%
                                      who takes pride in saying talents are scarce and they put
                                      themselves as talents which are not obviously always the case -
                                      they have the money their words become rules and facts</span>.<br> The truth is that we pay these workers such low wages not primarily
                                      because their productivity is<br> inherently low, but largely because they are competing against an
                                      unlimited supply of cheap<br> foreign workers. Because cheap workers are so plentiful, they tend
                                      to be employedTrue, but all emerging mkts in order to move up must
                                      offer cheap cost of operations first and especially spore is so
                                      small with no hinterland.<br> unproductively. In the Nordic countries, unskilled workers are
                                      relatively scarce and thus deployed<br> more productively, with higher skills, mechanisation, and beô€„´er
                                      organisation.<span style="color: #ff0000;">The vast difference in pay cannot be made up by
                                      upgrading or automation - it has to come from the hearts of the top
                                      0.5% and whether the top 20% want to share the burden or not.</span><br> What is the solution? The solution is for the State to reduce the
                                      supply of cheap foreign workers<br> or introduce a minimum wage or to target specific industries, such
                                      as the hospitality industry, for<br> wage enhancement.<span style="color: #ff0000;">As explained above, these 2 solutions are not
                                      possible.  One, 200k maids could be reduced to only families
                                      of handicaps/aged parents but these people would have to pay huge
                                      cost - who is going to help them.  The 1million foreign
                                      labours consist of construction workers and cleaners are more
                                      difficult.  OK we can stop construction since we are quite
                                      built up.  But for cleaners impossible because sporeans have
                                      dirty irresponsible habits compared to western people. Western
                                      countries they do not have much cleaners and so few bins and yet so
                                      clean and tidy.  Asians are bad in this respect - so who can
                                      change this behaviour and culture?  Not possible.  For
                                      those manual labours in ship building etc ok they can shift
                                      overseas causing sporeans in supervisory and managerial positions
                                      jobless.  No need for plumbers and electricians and mechanics
                                      as people have to DIY - those cannot pay the high price -
                                      plausible</span>.<br> LESSON NO. 2<br> Higher fertility<br> ONE of our challenges is our low fertility rate. For a country’s
                                      population to remain stable, it<br> needs a total fertility rate (TFR) of 2.14. Singapore’s current TFR
                                      is 1.2. Our population experts tell <br> us that our population will begin to shrink by 2025. They have,
                                      therefore, argued that, to make up<br> the deficit, we need to import foreigners to add to our
                                      population.<br> Importing foreigners is the second best solution. The best solution
                                      is to raise our TFR. On this<br> point, our policymakers seem to have run out of ideas. The various
                                      incentive schemes, such as<br> baby bonus, do not seem to be productive. It is time to look at our
                                      four European countries for<br> inspiration. Their 2010 TFRs were as follows:<br> Denmark: 1.87<br> Finland: 1.87<br> Norway: 1.95<br> Sweden: 1.98<span style="color: #ff0000;">As long as they are not at displacement level, it only
                                      says they take longer time to face the problem in spite of putting
                                      in so huge cost into it.</span><br> The four Nordic countries have TFRs which are close to the
                                      replacement level. This achievement<br> seems extraordinary. They do not have the benefit of maids. There
                                      are over 200,000 foreign<br> domestic workers in Singapore. They also do not have grandparents
                                      who help with childâ€�rearing.<br> At the same time, they have very high participation of women in
                                      their workforces. In terms of<br> availability of time and help for childâ€�rearing, common sense would
                                      suggest that the TFR in<br> Singapore should be higher than those in the Nordic countries. How
                                      do we explain this paradox?<span style="color: #ff0000;">It is not so much about availability of
                                      time and help for child-rearing as Prof Koh has pointed out. 
                                      I feel the most critical point is sporeans have experienced the
                                      large familly burden and loss of freedom to enjoying burden free
                                      small families thru nation-wide birth control whereas none of the
                                      advanced countries  experience that.  It is natural for
                                      them to have big families in general because they have not gone
                                      thru nation-wide popn control.  They tend to love animals and
                                      hence children beside some religious support(catholicism). When a
                                      nation(not just a few or some or many) experience the impact of
                                      good live it is very difficullt to go back to more disciplined life
                                      like less travelling.</span><br> Our population experts cannot explain this paradox. I will venture
                                      a hypothesis. I believe that the<br> high TFR in the Nordic countries could be due to four factors: the
                                      availability of convenient,<br> affordable and good childcare; good workâ€�life balance; an excellent
                                      and relatively stressâ€�free<br> education system; and the relative absence of male chauvinism.<span style="color: #ff0000;">These
                                      4 factors are by no means easy for spore to transit to and yet
                                      their results still fall short of replacement level</span>.<br> Let me say a few words on each of the four factors.<br> First, one of the missing links in Singapore is the inadequate
                                      supply of conveniently located, good<br> quality and affordable childcare for infants and young children.<span style="color: #ff0000;">To
                                      be able to afford this, much higher pay or govt must foot the
                                      bills.  In Perth, a migrant accountant could only afford to
                                      send their kids for 3 days a week to childcare - I learn
                                      personally.</span><br> Second, the workâ€�life balance in Singapore, especially for many
                                      young professionals such as<br> lawyers, architects and teachers, is poor. Singaporeans work one of
                                      the longest hours in the<br> developed world. They have liô€„´le energy for life other than work
                                      and thus liô€„´le time for<span style="color: #ff0000;">Not all professionals are busy and those who
                                      are free are not having babies too</span><br> meaningful family life.<br> The Government and our employers should reflect on whether the
                                      existing climate of<br> encouraging or requiring our young professionals to work late into
                                      the night is necessary or<br> desirable.<span style="color: #ff0000;">Please note it is still the top 0.5%'s control. 
                                      Sometimes the employees are to be blamed because they want to
                                      excel.</span><br> Third, sociologists like Paulin Straughan have pointed out that
                                      Singapore’s highly competitive and<span style="color: #ff0000;">This is purely sociologists' thinking.  I feel it is the parents' decision not really
                                      the education system.  In Perth, those sporeans migrated
                                      because they want to give their children a stress free education
                                      and work put their children in costly private schools because they
                                      want their children to learn more what the public schools do not
                                      teach.  In Kumon Perth, those who send their kids for
                                      enrichment classes are all mainly asians.  Actually, spore
                                      schools std are now quite unform and provide eca and volunteering
                                      to students making competition fairer to the poorer students. 
                                      Just imagine if the schools do not provide this, those from middle
                                      income families and above would be sending their kids to enrichment
                                      courses and tuition etc - making the competition less equal. 
                                      If the students are like western countries and yet they cannot have
                                      boy-girl relationships at young age then most of the childhood time
                                      would be spent on internet - as it is now asian kids spend most
                                      time on computer than western kids - I believe is because they
                                      believe in boy-girl socialisation on top of sports.</span><br> stressful education system is also a deterrent to working parents
                                      having more children. The<br> Nordic countries, on the other hand, are famous for their high
                                      quality, egalitarian education<br> which fulfils the children’s aspiration for a happy childhood. It
                                      is a paradox that Finland, with no<br> streaming, no elite schools and no private tuition industry, is
                                      ranked as having the world’s best<br> education system.<span style="color: #ff0000;">I always think could be Finland is a cold
                                      country(less sunshine) with nothing much to do and so have least
                                      distractions than spore kids.  In any case, spore education
                                      achieve less variability in std in the world but are not that
                                      stellar on the top end.  Private tuition cannot raise std
                                      because they simplify the students' learning experience and make
                                      them more lazy and have more time to play - I know professionals do
                                      not  think this way but I know I am right about this.  I
                                      see so many Top JC students in Perth (excellent O and<br> A) but cannot have the passion to beat caucasions where caucasions only
                                      face one national exam in year 12 because they want to go
                                      univ.  Top JC students learn more than A-Lvll but do not
                                      appear the head start eventually make any difference to the degree
                                      results because they are less passionate in learning.  Perhaps
                                      in local univers, the same thing happens and jealousy over foreign
                                      students become worse.</span><br> Fourth, it is significant that the developed countries with low
                                      TFRs include Japan, Korea, Italy<br> and Spain, which have a high degree of male chauvinism. Is it
                                      possible that Singapore too has a<br> high degree of male chauvinism? The women of Singapore are oô€„žen
                                      blamed for not marrying and<br> having children. Perhaps, the main problem is not our women but our
                                      men. Perhaps, what we<br> also need is a mindset change on the part of our men towards the
                                      status and role of our women<br> and the shared responsibilities of the husband and wife, and father
                                      and mother in domestic<br> chores and childâ€�rearing.Of course, <span style="color: #ff0000;">this male chauvinism is
                                      difficult to change - asian culture.</span><br> LESSON NO. 3<br> Embracing nature and sustainable development<br> SINGAPORE is probably Asia’s cleanest, greenest and most liveable
                                      city. Our air is healthy, our<br> water is potable and our land is wholesome. In addition, we enjoy
                                      good public health and food<br> safety. Visitors are astonished by the fact that, in spite of our
                                      high density, 47 per cent of our land<br> is covered in greenery. In view of this, the reader will ask what
                                      can we learn from the four Nordic<br> countries? I suggest three things.<br> First, people there love nature and their natural heritage. They
                                      seem to have an emotional, even a<br> spiritual, relationship with nature. They love their forests, lakes
                                      and ô€„¦ords. In contrast, most<br> Singaporeans tend to have a more pragmatic relationship with
                                      nature. They apply a costâ€�benefit<br> analysis to the destruction of a natural heritage. Pragmatism is
                                      one of our virtues. We should,<br> however, be aware of the defects of our virtues. Not everything in
                                      life can be monetised.<br> Second, we can learn useful lessons from the way in which the
                                      Nordic countries have been able<br> to reconcile economic competitiveness with a deep commitment to
                                      sustainable development.<br> Aô€„žer the 1992 Earth Summit, each of them has established a national
                                      commission to mainstream<br> sustainable development.<br> In the case of Finland, the Prime Minister chairs the National
                                      Commission on Sustainable<br> Development. The result is that there is a national consensus in
                                      each of those countries to<br> internalise the ethic of sustainable development into all aspects
                                      of life.<br> Third, at the microâ€�level, there are lessons in areas where
                                      Singapore has room for improvement –<br> for example, in energy efficiency, the use of solar energy, the
                                      recycling of waste, the use of<br> nonâ€�polluting buses, changing unsustainable paô€„´erns of consumption
                                      and production, etc.<br> LESSON NO. 4<br> Heritage, culture and the arts<br> IN THE past two decades, inspired by the 1989 Ong Teng Cheong
                                      report and Mr George Yeo’s<br> leadership at the then Ministry of Information and the Arts,
                                      Singapore has undergone a paradigm<br> shiô€„ž in the areas of heritage, culture and the arts. The arts have
                                      blossomed. More and more<br> Singaporeans are interested in knowing their history and preserving
                                      their heritage. The trend is,<br> therefore, favourable. What can we learn from the Nordic
                                      countries?<br> First, we can learn the importance of giving all our children a
                                      good education in the arts. We have<br> made good progress in recent years. The opening of the Yong Siew
                                      Toh Conservatory of Music<br> and the School of The Arts were important milestones.<br> We can strengthen arts education in our schools. We should consider
                                      starting courses in art<br> history and museum studies at the undergraduate and graduate
                                      levels. This will help in the<br> training of teachers, curators, dealers, collectors and museum
                                      administrators, all in short supply.<br> Second, we can emulate the achievements of the Nordic countries in
                                      respect of museums. They<br> have an impressive range of museums with strong collections. They
                                      have been able to harness the<br> benefit of publicâ€�private partnership. Their museum collections
                                      extend beyond their nations to<br> the cultures of the world.<br> For example, the David Collection in Copenhagen is one of the
                                      world’s best collections of Islamic<br> Art. The Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art in Helsinki has a very
                                      ambitious programming<br> agenda, covering Western as well as Asian and African art.<br> Third, because of their ancient Viking past and current strength in
                                      shipping and other maritime<br> industries, Denmark, Norway and Sweden have outstanding museums of
                                      maritime history.<br> Given the importance of maritime trade to Singapore’s past and
                                      present, it is puzzling that we do<br> not have a museum of maritime history. I hope one day the historic
                                      Clifford Pier, which now<br> houses a restaurant, will be the home of a worldâ€�class museum of
                                      maritime history. When that<br> time comes, we can look to the Nordic countries for
                                      inspiration.<span style="color: #ff0000;">Embrace nature is good but arts are for the rich. 
                                      I do not find myself a misfit in society just because I could not
                                      appreciate art or olympics.  What is more important that the
                                      top 0.5% has a far more compassionate in not seeking breaking
                                      records of earnings because earnings are determined by them .</span><br> By Tommy Koh, For The Straits Times, May 19,
