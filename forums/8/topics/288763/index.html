            <div class='col-md body'>there's a reason why there is preferred entrance provided to JC students.<br><br>basically, JC students wish to take the riskier route of having a "useless" A level cert to get into Uni one year faster than Poly students. Poly students have less risk as they get a professional cert that already allows them to get substantial jobs. JC studies are too basic in any field to get a proper professional job.<br><br>the differences between entrance into JC and Poly has been declining through the years. Ie. L1R5 15 points to get into a ok JC, L1R4 13 to get to an ok course in poly. therefore, if you wanna go into uni, just go to JC!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let it be specially made for poly students. So theyd stop complaining that they cant get in. And then mourn for the poor JC students who cant get into university because they dont have anything worthwhile. I look at people in my army camp. Just look across the room and i can find a handful of A level students that didnt make it into university. But they arent complaining. They are gonna retake their A levels, or go to poly, go overseas, go to private university. But just nearby are a bunch of poly grads complaining they cant get into university. Who is worse off?<br><br>I dont mind the 4th university being a liberal arts college. It is time for something new.</div>

It just that should the 4th uni take u more student. As wat i noe not all poly student with gpa of 3.5 or above gets to enter local uni. Come'on, keep the comment coming in.<br><br>I need some positive feedback from u guy. What are your expectation, like having good research facilites or better program?
