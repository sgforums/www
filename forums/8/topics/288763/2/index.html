JC students made the choice to take the risk, Why should poly students be punished because of that? And is $1,500 even a decent pay? I can get more working part-time.<br><br>There are hundreds of poly graudates having GPA 3.5 or better yet only a handful make it to poly.<br><br>My question to you, Are you a male? Do you realise that guys have to serve NS? Should a guy fail his O level one time too many, You realise much it jeopardises his life? He can't simply just keep on retaking his O levels until he has good enough result to get into JC. Do you think the SAF would let him do so?<br><br>Then by what you are saying, Are we going to deprive the people with poorer results a chance to furthur their studies? What ever happened to equality? A Levels students should be given more worth? What are you? A elitist wannabe?</div></blockquote>Again you do not comprehend my point on the pay. If they dont get into uni, the poly student will get a MORE decent pay COMPARED to the A level student. So if they have the same job, the poly student will get 1500 and the A level student may get 1200. Comparatively more decent.<br><br>I am a male and i understand the situation. It is the same thing with the JC student failing his A levels again and again and yet he cant make into Uni, but he is still stuck with a sh,tty cert. And if he fails again and again, it is already a sign that he is not suited for university.<br><br>We are an equal society, meaning everyone starts off with equal opportunities. After the start, you cannot expect equality because singapore is a meritocratic society. If everyone is equal, there will be no leaders, no rich or poor. Equality will exist only in Heaven (even then its not exactly true because God is still higher) If the universities are accepting more "students with poorer results" then its going to further dilute the value of a degree. We cannot avoid the fact that singapore is becoming more and more elitist. All the more people should think before they make their choices. With regard to elitist-wannabe, that is just unjustified. Universities are MEANT for the elites of today's society. If any tom dick and harry can get in, then what is the point at all? So are you calling the Ivy league universities elitist just because they only accept the top notch students?<br><br>And no one is depriving people with poor results, of their education. They can still go to private universities here.</div>

While there is some truth that poly students should have considered their options carefully if this was the route that they had wanted to take, there shouldn't be any complaints, it doesn't obscure the fact that A levels and polytechnic have an altogether different curriculum and culture.
