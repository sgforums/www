            <div class='col-md body'>Dedicated to my Macbeth Witches...most notably to one of you.<br><br>One night stand. Some mythical urbanic tales that I seldom believe, nor trust in. And yet, what had happened to me recently, can I called it a one night stand? Or rather, the coming together of body and mind? Ladies and gentlemen, you be the honest judges of it all.<br><br>I meet her over the net. And again, nothing surprising in it. I have been meeting gals over the net for a very long time and I would say, with sadness, one of my main hunting grounds for finding a partner. Suffice to say few dates came out rightÂ…but that was really in the minority. Looks aside, some chemistry seems to be missing when I meet up with them. However, this time round, this very special gal changes all of my perceptions, and changes the rest of my life.<br><br>I knew her through another mutual friend in the net.<br>Â“Yo pal, check out this babe. SheÂ’s rather fun to chat to! SheÂ’s a pal of the gal I am chasing now. Who knows, we might just double date later on huh?Â” he chuckled.<br>And this concluded the first time I meet her, from a dingy picture showing across my PC deep in the night.<br><br>We started by emailing one another and I must admit the experience was very different from others. She was smart and she was articulate. And better of all, I worshipped her beauty. I wasnÂ’t shy about telling her how I feel and she accepted my words graciously. One thing lead to another and soon, we move from words to phonics. We talked about everything and anything under the sun.<br><br>The day finally arrived when I meet up with her. And no, it was not a double date with my pal. We meet alone in Cityhall and when I meet her, I knew the photos did not do her justice. She was simply gorgeous and most surprisingly, or fateful for me, she has just turned single in her status. Initially, I was sceptical about meeting herÂ…I mean, why should she like an ordinary mortal like me? But my fears were put to rest. She likes what I can quote from Shakespeare than looking like Di Caprio in Romeo and Juliet.<br><br>The date just passed by in a wish. We shopped, dined and watched a show. Whenever we were in conversation, I can't help but graze into her eyes with a burning sensation. It was at that moment of time when I knew I wanted her. There and then. There is no stopping me now. I feel like an animal, wanting to possess her and make her my woman. I think she can sense it, the arousal in me that she had sparked off, for she kept a distance away from me.<br><br>Night falls and as we were walking towards the bus stop, I grab her hand. She did not reject it out of hand.<br>Â“You know very well I wanted you the moment I set my eyes on youÂ” I mumbled to her<br>Â“IÂ…I know, but this is coming to suddenly to meÂ” she whimpered<br>Â“DonÂ’t reject me and let me have a chance to prove my love for youÂ” I urged her<br>Â“Where do you want to go then?Â” she looked at me and asked<br>Â“Somewhere where we can spent the whole night togetherÂ” I whispered into her ears.<br>She stiffens but she did not shake her hands off from me.<br><br>We went to a hotel and before we even stepped in, we were already kissing passionately in the front door. I explored her tongue with an urgency I have never felt in my whole life before and I can almost taste the sweet orange juice she had consumed just now. I slammed the door shut and I just grab hold of her tightly.<br>Â“DonÂ’t leave me. Stay with me. I love youÂ” I told her<br>She submitted to me and that night, we made love. Glorious loves that I have never experience before. We never sleep the whole night. We talked, we hugged in the bed, we showered together like 2 little kids and we make love when the passion grabbed us. These, over and over again. When morning arrived, we were too tired to say anything.<br><br>And yet, I knew this would be the last time I am meeting her. And this is one of the reasons why I am so anxiously to have her there and then. You see, she will be flying off to the States this coming weekend for her studies. And most likely, she will not be back for 3 years. Despite all this, we have no regrets. We made no promises and yet, we declared our love. Contradictory? Very, and yet, deep down in our hearts, we know we can only go this way, this path.<br><br>SoÂ…is this the mythical one night stand I hear about all the time? Is my love with her that night a one night stand? I donÂ’t knowÂ…we meet only once and we did it. And yet, I felt like I have known her for ages. And no, I will not be seeing her off. Our love begins and ended on that night.<br><br><strong>"I have a most peaceable disposition. My desires are for a modest hut, a thatched roof, but a good bed, good food, very fresh milk and butter, flowers in front of my window and a few pretty trees by my door. And should the good Lord wish to make me really happy, he will allow me the pleasure of seeing about six or seven of my enemies hanged upon those trees."<br>-Heinrich Heine</strong><br><br>------------------<br>The heartless and souless fool.<br><br>[This message has been edited by james~ (edited 09 November 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The hair on the back of my neck was standing.  Over and over again I caught his eyes as he looked at me with intensity that simply made me want to avert my gaze.  A sort of glass bubble separated us from the rest of the humanity; inside this bubble our voices echo.  "What do I do <strong>when</strong> he asks me?"<br><br>There was nowhere else to go, but I didn't want to say good bye.  I was wringing my brain, trying to find an excuse to prolong the night when he grabbed my hands and said "You know I want you."  What do I do, if it's a yes it would be an avalanche I couldn't stop even if I wanted to.  If I said no, then this magic of a night would just shatter despite the long, woonderful hours we'd spent together.  What do I do?<br><br>I supressed all thoughts as he dragged me through the human traffic, onto the cab, into a hotel.  "Too late, too late, too late" echoed in my mind incessantly, drowning all thoughts of pulling back.  Up the staircase, into a room dominated by a white bed.  Finally he stopped.  There was nothing else to do but to fall into his arms and kissed him.<br><br>He took a part of me and I couldn't let go.  We tumbled onto the bed and passion filled the room with heat - I fancied I saw the room turned red-.  His hands were strong, his pace frantic.  The "toolate" sounds surged in a crescendo as he surged into me.  Then it mercifully stopped as he started to move.<br><br>"I love you" he said.  He shouldn't have told me.<br><br>When it's over I hid my face in the crook of his neck, hoping that he might think all I wanted to do was to inhale his scent.  I wondered if this was to be the one and only time we loved each other but I didn't voice it.  Playing now the roles of all good one night stands I've read or watched before I strived to be gracious, to take it lightly, to have no regret, to enjoy it when it's there.  He played it most convincingly, too.  I wondered if he was even acting.<br><br>At one point before the night ended I got my answer.  Maybe it's his eyes but I knew for sure he's serious.  Unwilling to be a trap I continued the facade.  "Yes, it was a wonderful night".  "Thank you, I know I'd enjoy my time in NY".  "You'd write to me?  Sure, I'd love to hear from you again".  I pictured looking backward at the airport to see if he's rushing, bursting through the door for a hug or just a touch.  I pictured autumn in New York.</div>
