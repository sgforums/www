            <div class='col-md body'>maya: ok, yeah, i guess taken solely on the merits of it's indigence to S'pore, Singlish may have some claim to part of national identity. (liberal lobbying aside) However, I still can't see Singlish speakers by necessity not hijacking it for excuse for their inadequacy. the long term effects will be crippling.<br><br>also, i'm hesitant about the argument that everything indigenous should be co-opted as national identity. there should be a thought-process prior to adoption. not all common denominators should be espoused. this scrambling search for national identity seems more to me as symptomatic of national insecurity and ethnic displacement, and the constant desire to (re)appropriate ourselves can of course lead to dangerous consequences.<br><br>cheers<br><br>------------------<br>I can resist anything but temptation.<br><br>Oscar Wilde</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wow! IÂ’m almost afraid to join in the fray but I couldnÂ’t resist. IÂ’ve following this posting for the last few days &amp; each time I would like to reply, I hold myself back for fear of being caught in the cross-fire, but what the heck?<br><br>What caught my attention was that Wizard actually dared to put on screen what I sometimes feel &amp; he (I presumed itÂ’s a he, if itÂ’s a she - my humble apologises.) is a Junior Member, just like me.<br><br>I think Wizard meant well when he suggested that prodigal &amp; Terence tone down their sarcasm &amp; the use of bombastic words in their posts - I think most of us couldnÂ’t have missed their sarcastic remarks in their posts, well, I find them pretty funny until the butt of the sarcasm happens to be me. What I also noticed  is that they also have the tendency to put people down, they may not be aware of it but itÂ’s there. And I think Wizard wasnÂ’t being mean when he made those suggestions, I think itÂ’s for their own good, why would we want to engage in a war of words with people weÂ’ve never even met? Joining  a forum, for me is to exchange ideas, pass time enjoyably, perhaps make friends &amp; broaden my mind but sometimes the way prodigal &amp; Terence replies is quite  intimdating because of their sarcasm &amp; their bombastic words &amp; the way they construct their sentences that it makes me think real hard if I want to contribute a posting or not for fear that I may get shot down. To me, itÂ’s like theyÂ’re trying to confuse me with a mountain of words when a simple sentence would have sufficed. They are defensive too, but then who isnÂ’t? That said, I still like them, that is I enjoy reading their postings.<br><br>Sarcasm between friends whom you have known for a long while is fine but with perfect strangers, one canÂ’t help but get uptight &amp; a little pissed but I think most of us are getting to know one another better now, so I guess weÂ’ll have to learn to live with it?. However, I hope that weÂ’ll try to prevent it from being offensive. I knew that the word Â“cretinÂ” wasnÂ’t a nice one &amp; checking the dictionary today, I had it confirmed, if Terence could take back that word, it would be a pleasant surprise.<br><br>The other thing I would like to bring up is that I hope that sometimes if a posting veers away from the topic at hand, gently correct us, not lambast us.<br><br>MAYA:<br><br>I donÂ’t think Wizard wasn't wrong in inferring that prodigal was against the use of Singlish because if you substitute the word Â“cheemÂ” in prodigalÂ’s post with Â“complex or too difficult for me to comprehandÂ”, prodigal would be valid in his first part of the post but not the ending. Just because one say something is Â‘cheemÂ’, it doesnÂ’t necessarily mean that one wonÂ’t continue to think about it, most probably one would like to drop the discussion at that point in time &amp; maybe find out more about it before continuing with the discussion. For what use is there in continuing if the topic being discussed is already beyond oneÂ’s understanding?<br><br>[prodigalÂ’s post: QUOTE] Singaporeans stopped at just saying that  "something is cheem" and do not continue thinking about the issue. It has a lot to do with the way we are educated. Because of the one-track mind we have gotten, we tend to stick to the exam books and not go beyond the subject. Being rigourous in a subject does not mean that one would end up to become ivory towers..... That is the fundamental point which I think, we are trying to drive at, with the point on pinning on why we should refrain from using Singlish words like "cheem".

[\QUOTE]<br><br>SINGLISH<br><br>Now for the discussion on Singlish generally. I hate it but I do use it, Singlish is unique to Singaporeans &amp; by speaking it, in a strange way it brings people closer. Singlish is a means of communication &amp; when youÂ’re having a conversation, the last thing on oneÂ’s mind is to mind its pÂ’s &amp; qÂ’s, I donÂ’t have a problem with it being spoken &amp; touted as a national identity but I do agree with SM Lee that SÂ’poreans have to attain a good standard of English in order to get ahead in an economic sense, weÂ’re a small country with no resources - how could we even dare to dream or to think that others will learn Singlish just to conduct business with us? Singlish only benefits people who already have a good grasp of English, then they have the best of both worlds but unfortunately, not everyone can switch between Singlish &amp; proper English.<br><br>Singlish is also useful for the older generation who had a few years of education but were denied the chance to continue due to unforeseen circumstances to conduct a conversation with the younger generation.<br><br>Singlish is bad but itÂ’s kind of like part of the SÂ’porean identity, I can only say that it will benefit oneself greatly if one makes a concerted effort to learn English properly before flirting with Singlish.<br><br>Correct me gently if anyone disagrees, no lambasting please.

But I also gave a very good reason for that. To put it bluntly, you are not very good at putting ideas across clearly. If your point was about how people should not hold a one track mind and that they should go beyond the subject instead of stopping short and saying somethiing is deep, then why did u have to SPECIFICALLY say we should refrain from SINGLISH WORDS like "cheem"? Is that poor presentation or what?

I was asking for an explanation of how i had quoted u out of context there...noting ambiguous about it... but realising u made a mistake in saying that, u just kept on avoiding it. And guess what? Thinking u have the upper hand in the "cheem" part (when u had completely missed my pt in contention), u jump at "illustrating your point" when i had already said i DID misinterprete it earlier (cuz of the reason i've already mentioned). Is this the best u can do?<br><br>and lastly, it seems to get a simple point across to u. I've said several times i wasn't "nitpicking" and that i was offering suggestions as to why u might be portraying a negative image. Is it really that hard to understand that?<br><br></div>

But my stand is that is not reason enough to do away with singlish. The people should be made to realise how important being able to speak proper english is and be motivated to improve themselves. There are many who are able to speak good english, in addition to singlish so why should singlish be a casualty of laziness or complacency?<br><br>I guess the same applies to your point about being constrained in thoughts by an inadequacy in language. This will not be a problem for people with a good aptitude in using a complex language such as english or chinese etc. My question now is again, is this reason enough to do away with singlish?<br><br>Right now the debate has become slightly blurred (on my side at least).

            <div class='col-md body'>As clear and brutal as I possibly can...<br><br>1. Singlish has a life of its own.<br><br>2. As a mode of comfortable informal social intercourse it cannot be eradicated even if there were a campaign. The pressures from structures do not always reach the organic and mobile intimacies of the venacular amongst agencies. Totalitarian and fascist regimes have, throughout history, attempted to eradicate ethnic languages but have failed. Hence to say that there is an anti-Singlish crusade is laughable. (The S'pore Govt can only try but it will fail.)<br><br>3. However, neither the inability to eradicate Singlish nor parading it as a form of ethnicity is good enough reason to activity promote it. This is because the consequences of promotion without prior language proficiencies will be to our ultimate disadvantage.<br><br>4. English must be the staple language because it is the language of commerce. One should strive to be able to articulate and write in English without flaw. There is no point in being multi-lingual in half measures, not fully masterful in any because one will be superficially conversant in different languages but ultimately impotent in them all.<br><br>5. Singlish is a quick and abrupt manner of speech. It reduces and constricts. As such meanings tend to be limited to generics. It is one thing to say that it is a language to convey simple ideas but another to wonder if the ideas are made simple by default through their conveyance in Singlish.<br><br>6. Its adoption as national identity is potentially detrimental because,<br>a. there are fewer people in reality who can switch between Singlish and 'proper' English than the number of people who actually think they can.<br>b. Singlish as national identity will make it something to be proud of. Singlish speakers without adequate proficiency in international English will not feel compelled to improve. Singlish as NI will become an asylum for poor English speakers for its a sociological fact that people take the path of least resistance. Not only will English proficiency levels decline, it's replacement by Singlish will be validated.<br><br>cheers<br><br>------------------<br>I desire to go to hell and not heaven.

Globalisation, ever-thickening umbilical cords to a global market economy and multiple diasporas are, whether we like it or not, developing, arguably, into a general notion of utilitarian philosophy. Even with contemporary fracturing and multi-narratives there must exist some semblance of mutual medium for mediation. As such while multi-centres are preserved, the cross-fertilisation that globalisation demands similarly demands a common medium. Even if one were to dispute this semblance of utilitarianism, one must admit localisation cannot be sustained in a laissez faire post-Cold War world.<br><br>cheers<br><br>------------------<br>I desire to go to hell and not heaven.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi colette,<br><br>Welcome to the discussion, and I have suddenly found so much replies after going on a day trip to Oxford to visit my ex-classmates there. And now it is like 3.00 am back here, and I found it so tempting to reply the posts here. If you think that we are going to shoot you down because of your comments, I would feel so sad that the arguments which we try to put forward are greeted with the misunderstanding of intellectual superiority and the image that we are shooting someone who showed us some fallacy of arguments where there is a need to clearly read what his posts are trying to suggest all the time, despite arguments were being made.<br><br>I find it strange that there is so much disagreement in an interpretation of a simple statement which I have made. I find it ridiculous for you to say that I was being too offensive or too much in pointing out intellectual dishonesty in someone's posts. I think that I have made it very clear what quoting out of context is about. In my last reply, I have delibrately clarified what the three issues are not to be mixed together in order to offer any ammunition for anyone to use that kind of inferential arguments which do not contribute to the arguments posed in the discussion.<br><br>Let me go back to that point, why I have made a comment about what is the point of using the word "cheem" to hide yourself from being ignorant. I would say that the first problem with a large proportion (let me reiterate here, not all) of Singaporean students is that they are myopic, lack of the big perspective and being too comfortable with their lives. Unfortunately, the education system is not good enough to change things. So what is happening in the Singaporean system with the infusion of Singlish? First of all, it corrupts the student's understanding of English. Then subsequently, because of the lack of ability in the application of the language, when the student is subject to the stringent tests of being thrown in a discussion where technical  knowledge and a stronger ground in the language are required, the student took the backdoor and ran away. You can say that I am being harsh to the student here, and yes, I am. The immediate problem is that the student  would try to justify himself why he could not be able to enter the discussions. What is the best way of self-delusion? You have the answer "The subject is being too cheem". That is what we should try to refrain from using a corrupted version of the language. Most of us might be able to distinguish between Singlish and English, but not all the poor students out there (includes those who are already weak in their abilities in the English language).<br><br></div>

Like i mentioned, it need not be recognise officially as a N.I, it's something that every one of us knew and can excerise.<br>English CAN be a common lang. that can foster closer times between the malays, indians and chinese...put in some local context and u will have the bastardised form: singlish.<br>No one say Singlish is something to be proud of. Frankly, i almost wish i can sink into a hole when some students gives their opinion in singlish at some major forums.Perhaps proper education is the key to all these<br>But back to my main point. There's no need for singlish to be recognise as a N.I. it IS one by the virtue of it being spoken at all levels by every S'porean.<br>like u say, no way can the govt. eradicate it, simply can't be done. We can't possibly glorify it too, as u mention correctly on point 5. thus, singlish will forever be a local underground slang of english practised by the natives here...and on local level too. This might be abit out, but how do u propose we deal with this issue?? To eradicate, promote or maintain???<br><br>to colette,<br>hey!!! don't worry, all opinions and views are welcome here. Be prepared to substained ur views thats all. And yes, this thread is very local in nature. First, all parties have the right to air their comments, as long as it is not inciting in nature. Second, be prepared to be rebutted if u put in nonsensical stuff.

Your point being?<br><br>2. "that can foster closer times between the malays, indians and chinese..."<br>What proof do you have that Singlish inculcates trust in a Chinese for a Malay, or vice versa? The local Chinese and indigenous Malays in Indonesia spoke Bahasa Indonesia but the 98 May riots flared for so many other reasons. A common language does not mean closer ties.<br><br>3.

            <div class='col-md body'>one last time about the cheem thing.  Prodigal used "cheem" and not "complex" because the previous posting by Mr. Hata San read like this: Waah Terence, you so cheem.  If he had said Waah Terence, you're so complex, I'm sure Prodigal would have used complex instead.<br><br>I've been thinking about the national identity part and I honestly can't find a national identity to fit Singapore.  What the heck is a national identity anyway?  Can someone tell me the national identity of, say, Japan?  Isn't it just a euphimism for the usual typecasting?<br><br>Lastly, though this is not a popular opinion, Singlish is not necessary to foster closer ties with anyone.  One can talk in a relaxed mood with friends using English and I believe the result will still be the same.  Once upon a time, when I did not have Singlish moods, I could talk to a classmate in English and even though usually his English was mixed up with Singlish vernacular he answered me in 'full' English.  Do we really need Singlish to get closer if the other party can understand English, anyway?<br><br>------------------<br>Sticks and stones may break my bones....<br>but whips and chains excite me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MayaJade<br>You are right in a sense that we need not use Singlish to feel closer but like i have empahsized in the first post, when u are in a foreign land, it serves as a "reconigtion" and it is like "Hey you are from Singapore, too??"..Of cos, whether we will be using Singlish or not, is really another issue.<br>To be able to converse is fll fledged Ehglish without using "Lahs, lehs or lors"..is possible and it really depends on the topics we are engaging in. If we were to gossip among Singaporean frens, Singlish comes naturally as it lightens the whole atmosphere.

            <div class='col-md body'>Heya adrian,<br><br>I was re-reading this thread again just so that I could clarify certain issues with the Sloppy Thoughts thread.<br><br>Upon reading your reply a second time, it was especially promising to find the same sort of indefinate and misunderstood usage of the common lexicon of the English language.<br><br>"ok, censor is to decide with power whether to show the viewers things that r on the grounds of obscenity, threat of security etc."<br><br>Let's try to recuperate your original thoughts from this jumbled piece of mess.<br><br>How do you "decide with power"? It should be "the power to decide".<br><br>"whether to show the viewers things that r on the grounds of obscenity". Perhaps this should be rephrased as to be unambiguous. Currently, it is in fact suggesting that it is the role of the censor to show viewers footage that is obscene. *laugh*<br><br>Lastly, "threat of security ".  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> This elicited guffaws for a non-stop 5 min. The threat of security???!!! Heh! Gee, most girls want to be threatened with secuirty then.<br><br>In ONE SENTENCE, you have managed to confuse all your thoughts and confuse the reader too ; meanwhile suggesting a totally contrasting stance to your "attempted" point.<br><br>I'm sure adrian wants to portray himself as a steadfast "Singlish" type... If any "Singlish" thread readers are reading this, this is perhaps what so dangerous abt the uncritical acceptance of Singlish into the national consciousness. Bad English simply gets muddled up with the overarching "positive" terminology of Singlish and thus is excused and *gasp* celebrated.<br><br>Dun misquote me out of context : I'm not saying that Singlish is bad but that it's very dangerous to leave ourselves a convienent hiding place for our inadequacy and inarticulateness.<br><br>In another post, Mateo commented that 12 Storeys was too "arty-fartsey". In a similar vein, what was engendered here was a discourse of the same rationale as Singlish. We resort to simplicity to articulate our lack of ideas and understanding. Proddy mentioned quite rightly that, instead of striving to understand better, we tend to dumb down. We want easy, piece-meal solutions and anything that requires a stretch of imagination or critical thought is to be considered "cheem", "artsy" and "intellectual" (there terms that are have bad currency in the capitalist Singapore).<br><br>I'm sorry that I am writing this in unrelated thread.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi MayaJade,<br><br>I suppose we should stop harping on the "cheem" thing, otherwise, we would be locked in an accusation of being "intellectually superior". I think I have more or less explained the context on what I say earlier on.<br><br>Well, the reason for this reply was not because of the "cheem" thing, but I would like to try to address the issue in a perspective of a non-social scientist about national identity which you posed in your most recent post. I would have to make 2 disclaimers : the first, I am not adaquately trained in the social sciences and may make a blunder of the use of terms (perhaps someone can correct me if I made any blunders) and second, is that I would adopt a scientific perspective in looking at the issue.<br><br>Let me go to the tenets of the issue at end, by first defining what national identity is all about. In a very loose perspective, I would define national identity of a country as a characteristic/feature/property which the other countries (excluding the country which we encoded the national identity, of course) would characterize and identify. Now the national identity would take a few forms of manifestation, via 1)language, 2)customs/traditions, 3)sociology and philosophy (if any) or 4)political ideology. With these tenets at hand, I would seek to address whether there exists a national identity for Singapore.<br><br>1)On the point of language, some of the forumites has advocated that Singlish is crucial to the maintenance of national identity. It can be viewed in 2 perspectives, first, Singlish used mixed words from different cultures, draw from the multi-ethnic and cultural population of Singapore and second, Singlish distinguishes the Singaporeans from the rest of the world. To reiterate my stand, I would think that Singlish is the agent which people used to advocate the national identity of the country, but not the feature of the country itself. For example, Japanese is inherent in Japan, because it is a feature of the country itself. Of course, one can argue that Japanese is a derivative of the Chinese language. However, it has evolved to become an independent language of its own. Then come back to the Singlish part, one can make similar inferences and say that Singlish is a derivative of English. Unfortunately, it has not evolved to be an independent language but stood as an aberration to the language for it does not adhere to the rules of the original language.<br><br>2)Then on customs/traditions, I think that Singapore possessed that, because we are a country which boasts of having different new years for different races/religions, something which is not commonly seen in many other countries (for example Britain has only the new year, Guy Fawkes day and the bank holidays).<br><br>3)On the sociology of the society, I would say that "kiasuism" can be regarded as a feature which distinguished a Singaporean from someone from other countries. Someone in my University told me that the Singaporeans he encountered are all "walking encyclopedias" because they seem to get all information on the subject for study to get the best grades.<br><br>4)Finally, on political ideology, as someone pointed it out earlier on, that the political ideology is Machievellian pragmatic or benelovent dictatorship.<br><br>From all these points, I would say that Singapore do have a national identity but may not be rooted as deep as the Japanese or Americans. The reason for that, we are a young nation, and it takes at least 200 hundred years to have a country having a fixed national identity.<br><br>I would be glad to elaborate on these points if required.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Since Proddy brought up Â‘kiasuismÂ’ perhaps it may be useful to illustrate the long-term effects of Singlish.<br><br>Â‘KiasuismÂ’, if it is simply the fear of losing out borne from a sense of perpetuation of wellbeing, is not particular to SÂ’pore. Proddy says Â‘kiasuismÂ’ distinguishes a SÂ’porean from a non-SÂ’porean; I would humbly disagree. All forms of competition in any circumstance will bring out a variety of responses Â– invariably anti-social ones as well. IÂ’ve encountered what we know as Â‘kiasuismÂ’ in my British universities, where competition is keen, by a plethora of nationalities, hence hiding of library books, marathon mugging, sneaking peeks at fellow studentsÂ’ notes while guarding personal ones like precious gems etc. are not particular to say, NUS or NTU. They are traits displayed by all nationalities under certain environments.<br><br>Singlish however, has canonised this term, imbuing it with notions of idiosyncrasy vis-Ã -vis the vernacular. The aura of novelty Singlish inserts into this trait ties its meaning to a specific locality as such perpetuating a sense of belonging for the term. To utter the word Â‘kiasuÂ’ becomes an utterance of locality without recognising it as a universal social-ill. Where else do you find the word Â‘kiasuÂ’ but in our sunny little island? As such, Singlish, among its many faults does not distinguish between universal phenomenon and particularity precisely because it is since a particular language.<br><br>cheers<br><br>------------------<br>I desire to go to hell and not heaven.

            <div class='col-md body'>so this is where all the fun is! darn....should have been here earlier. so much has been written already. maybe some random thots just to make me feel good abt myself.<br><br>i wonder if anyone has ever bothered trying to pin down what singlish really is. not that i'm asking for a definition (not all things admit of definitions). but what is it really to be speaking in singlish? it seems a mix of the right (or wrong) accent, littered with phrases from other languages and dialects, some coinages of its own (like the "lah"), and bad sentence structure and formation (because its main medium is english (a medium within a medium!) and yet it doesn't stay true to this medium). singlish has no "right" way of being wrong. as long as you speak badly, and there's a whole lot of ways to speak poorly, then you speak singlish. there is of course a certain structure to singlish sentences (it mimics english but is expected to be a poor artist). no one, however, would fault you for being poor in singlish. the criticism is usu the other way around - atrocious singlish means even worse english. and tho a foreigner may fault you for bad english, it seems strange to fault that foreigner for being poor in singlish. but why is that?<br><br>simply because we expect english to be taken seriously (that is, there are standards of good and bad english) but not singlish. nothing really hinges on someone speaking poorly in singlish (except maybe strange looks from those thoroughly proficient in singlish, and singlish alone).<br><br>ask yourself now, if i took away the accent, and spoke with a british one, while all the other features of singlish remained the same, would i still be identified as speaking singlish? or just bad (even atrocious) english? now if i retained the accent, but littered my speech with lots of big words, would i still be speaking singlish?<br><br>there is a point to all this of course. while there are no "real" standards for speaking good singlish, there is a way that singlish is not to be spoken. it is not, i would contend, to speak it with a foreign accent (the way speaking english in a variety of accents is still to speak english). it is not to be able to use much more than certain simple words that wouldn't offend the singlish speakers' ears. built into the very nature of singlish, is the ability to NOT speak well (relative of course to mainstream languages).<br><br>is singlish really the dumping ground of much-used phrases from the various other languages and dialects? if so, i suggest that these "words" were selected for their ability to convey something that binds s'poreans in some (vague but important) way. it gives a sense of belonging and lends a feeling of familiarity. and so does the accent. to speak singlish is hence to speak in a coffee-shop, auntie-next-door, friend-friend, buddy-buddy kinda way. this is what gives us a sense of community.<br><br>but there will be times you don't want to be friend-friend. when you want to speak as decently as you can. is singlish adequate to such times? since english is the main medium within singlish, to say something more than what you can in singlish is to revert to english. simply because english is a more developed language and so allows you to say more. but this doesn't mean that only english gives you the ability to articulate yourself in a complex (or even abstract) way. any developed language (like chinese or whatever) should give you that ability (coupled of course with some grey matter between the ears). so it is less the fault of singlish than it is of the poor mastery of english that leads to poor english (and by extension, thinking) skills. but if singlish wasn't made (or meant) for complex thinking (i take it singlish came abt as a means of rudimentary, everyday communication of the most basic level), then it wouldn't be fair to criticize it on that account either. it would have to be criticized based on another value (or valuation) that lies beyond singlish, say, in the value of exchanges that can only take place with a more complete language. these exchanges can take the form of higher level business deals or academic debate or legal-speak or abstract contemplation or whatever. without some value placed on these exchanges, singlish itself loses none of its value.<br><br>still, the issue is whether singlish as such hampers the learning of good english. but while most ppl seem to think it does, there is a way that it does not, but actually helps promote it.<br><br>recall that there is no right or significantly correct way of speaking singlish (apart from the few features i pointed out). so if someone's singlish is of a worse quality than someone else's, we are likely to say that person's english sux. we are less likely to say that person's singlish sux (or if bad english is good singlish, then to say that that person's singlish is top notch. we won't say sth like this).<br><br>hence, apart from the few featues i pointed out, there is no competition with english. there IS a way of speaking good english. but no (significantly) RIGHT way of speaking singlish. you don't really have to learn to speak singlish, since any bad use of grammar or tense or whatever immediately falls under the domain of singlish. that is, singlish just is the repository of all bad english, however that bad english habit was formed.<br><br>but could it be that singlish itself led to the bad english habit? again, if it did, it only does so in a derivative way, i.e. from being in a singlish-envt for too long without the benefit of proper english. but singlish itself lays no independent claims since it is not, properly speaking, a language that can be wrongly used (apart from some features i already mentioned). what this means is that to speak good english, we have to counter all forms of deviant english, including singlish. but this countering can take the form of contrasting these deviant forms from what is good english. here singlish serves as a rich source of correction when it comes to learning good english, since singlish is the domain of commonly bad uses of english. there is a place for singlish in learning good english after all. the tricky part is teaching someone to distinguish the two. there is no substitute however for wanting to learn good english and then putting it into practice (like here in the forum maybe).<br><br>further, it is only with a heightened consciousness that singlish is bad english that ppl will feel insecure and compelled to move beyond singlish. as it is now, to make ppl insecure abt using singlish (the way the govt has made PCK insecure) is the only way to push them to learn better english.<br><br>and here, as above, singlish will serve as the starting point (and a point of contrast)from which we should depart towards the fairer shores of the english language.<br><br>p.s.: can't help commenting on the personal feuds that have erupted. the point from both sides seem to mirror one another. that is, those who are good in english say that those good in singlish can't understand what is said in good english, since the latter opens a whole new world of concepts and ideas which are beyond the singlish-dwellers' comprehension. and yet the english-dwellers have been charged with the same thing - that in being too good with concepts and words, those good in english have failed to make themselves comprehensible to those proficient in singlish. "have english-dwellers forgotton how to communicate simply?", seems to be the common refrain.<br><br>anyways, if language is really abt communication, and communication is abt understanding, then it seems that both sides have a little trouble with that right now. "you just don't understand me!", both sides are saying. ironic isn't it?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
