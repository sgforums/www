            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, Mr Hata-san,<br><br>Well, it is alright to me because I am just pointing out that you have committed a fallacy of argument here. Try not to do that again  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>First of all, there are plausible reasons why I have made the comment that statements like "you are too cheem" are being more childish than satirical. I may agree that some people possess the intellectual capability to use it to poke fun at others using this word (since in Singlish, it means difficult and beyond reasoning). However, the problem lies in that there exists the other group of people who blindly followed the crowd and used these statements without realizing what they are doing. You see, if one tries to twist the rules of the language and uses his/her own form, what is likely to happen is that he or she would not be able to communicate effectively.<br><br>My contention is similar with Terence's on one very important point is that Singlish is limited to Singaporeans, and that alienates us from the World. The world is bigger than that.<br><br>What I think that both he and I could agree commonly in (and I maybe wrong, and Terence, you can correct me if necessary) that what we do not like about Singaporeans stopped at just saying that "something is cheem" and do not continue thinking about the issue. It has a lot to do with the way we are educated. Because of the one-track mind we have gotten, we tend to stick to the exam books and not go beyond the subject. Being rigourous in a subject does not mean that one would end up to become ivory towers. When I was doing my Masters in UK last year, I encounter this guy who was very good and interested in his area (which was like mine), and you would think that he would become a good scientist, but he chose to be a banker. That is the fundamental point which I think, we are trying to drive at, with the point on pinning on why we should refrain from using Singlish words like "cheem".<br><br>Then, I give you a scenario, a foreigner (be it an ang moh or East Asian) enters into the Sgforums and read a post, and see that there are words which they do not understand because of the way we twisted it and how we bend the rules. It totally deters them away from us.<br><br>Perhaps, I am inclined to believe that not most of the people here would like to engage in deep thought about the issues like some of us here (for example Terence). But it does not stop you from learning and also trying to make better arguments in the next time, and be better that someday you can engage us on the same level of language and critical thinking. Believe it or not, I failed my English in secondary school during secondary 2 and it took a good teacher to give me the chance to teach me how to read/write properly, and I was glad that I did very well in my literature and GP later. Now, I can use it to write stories (which I aspired to since I was in primary school but could not do so because of my poor English then).<br><br>Have a good day..<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some nations or nationalities have their own way of speaking English. Take for instance the blacks in America. The way they speak English is unique to their culture. Same for the Spanish, Italians, Australians, Irish...the list can go on and on.<br><br>I guess Singlish is just another one of those ways.

            <div class='col-md body'>My secondary school English teacher differentiates between Singlish and Singapore English.  Singapore English is speaking English the Singapore way, for example: I am going to Orchard.  You want to <span style="font-style: italic;">follow</span>? and I am <span style="font-style: italic;">attached</span> happily to Mr. Jade<br>Singlish, according to the said teacher, is the use of other language's words with English.  These local words include xian, alamak and si bei xiong.  Perhaps foreigners should understand Singapore English, and if they get huffy over it then by all means they are welcome to speak to their own kind.  However, I doubt that someone unfamiliar with Singlish terms can get what one is saying.<br><br>Yes different countries have different ways of speaking English, but when it is twisted until it turns ugly it is not alright anymore.  Don't you realize that when people showcase a Chinese or Mexican immigrant in America saying "No can do" they are laughing at him?  Can you honestly feel proud of not learning something properly because it seems to be enough to talk to people around you?  English is an established language, it has its own set of rules.  Creating a makeshift language with the intention of using it fully as the <strong>first language</strong> is similar to dragging yourself up to the Stone Age.<br><br>I understand that national pride may be offended with the thought of speaking proper English to entertain those <span style="font-style: italic;">bloody foreigners</span> because everybody else in Singapore(?) understand what you are saying.  If you can't honestly see that the use of Queen's English benefits you, too, then maybe Singapore should introduce itself as a Singlish speaking country instead of English.<br><br>------------------<br>Have you ever started dating because you're too lazy to kill yourself?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi bochup,<br><br>Well, the discussion is still on, and I think that the Singlish issue has everything to do with the development of a country as a whole. Afterall, in all regards communication is an essential feature and a bridge to the human civilization. I don't think that the thread is dead in any sense yet.<br><br>On your point with regards to Mandarin as a 2nd language, I see that the problem is more of the way the language is being taught. Being in a traditional family, I have done Chinese calligraphy, and appreciate the merits of the Tang, Song and Han poetry at a young age, which also gave me a hard time in learning to hold a pen properly. The point is that the way Chinese is taught in Singapore is very boring. For one thing, the Chinese teachers fail the students for being creative. I remember in my time, people who tried to be creative by expressing Chinese with essays about science fiction and fantasy were failed on the spot (despite those friends of mine are very good in Mandarin as well). What I think, the Ministry of Education should try to extend the cirriculum with an inclusion to Chinese history and literature. Maybe that might help to improve the Chinese culture. I am not sure about the language of Malay, and would fail to make any proper comments. What I think, which I found it as an advantage on my side of the world, Singaporeans are normally praised with a good standard of English compared to the counterparts in China, HK, Taiwan, Malaysia and Indonesia. The reason given by linguists in my university who did the extensive research is due to the age which we started. So, if we start with a good language background, it would be essentially helpful for trade and other reasons.<br><br>In some sense, I don't think one should use the argument that Singlish is a manner to establish national identity, because it just purports laziness, as MayaJade put it very clearly with her earlier post.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>maya,<br>i know what you mean but i wonder, how can one-liners like "Singlish suxs" or "Singlish is COOL" contribute to any debate? but anyway, i do take your point.<br><br>general,<br><br>i'm no linguist or cultural anthropologist but i'll like to throw another hypothesis into the ring.<br><br>perhaps singlish is not a symptom of national identity. to say that singlish reflects our multi-racial character one must show why singish is ONLY a recent phenomenon (20-30 years old? anyone?) when singapore has been multi-racial since good old raffie stepped on the banks of kallang river in 1819. along with the immigrants came different local and largely autonomous languages like english, malay and chinese dialects. as ethnic groups interacted malay became the lingua franca until in the early 60s. (mandarin was imposed later as 2nd language wasn't it?) there was no need at that time for a hybrid of languages (singlish) as malay was widely used and considered common enough. as such the vital semiotics of singlish (malay, english and chinese dialects) were already prevalent; so why did singlish not evolve by the turn of the 20th cent when a sufficient number of the population knew english. for example the Babas and Nonyas where chinese brought up in a malay culture and were the most proficient in english then but we wouldn't say they spoke singlish as we know it would we?<br><br>rather, i think, even as contemporary education has yielded high academic standards, there has been a general decline in vocal articulation abilities. we have weaken in our language proficiency and singlish evolved not as national identity nor something we can be proud of but as a symptom of laziness and inability. singlish was touted as a national heritage during the 80s when the whole island was taken up by the national ideologue of creating identity and sense of belonging, and singlish was adopted by liberal social commentators. it was formally frowned upon but informally accepted. over time, it has taken a life of its own, and the small percentile proficient in english have the privileged opportunity to CHOOSE and SWITCH between good english and singlish while the non-proficient percentile have NO CHOICE but to employ it for continued articulation.<br><br>cheers<br><br>------------------<br>I can resist anything but temptation.<br><br>Oscar Wilde</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why does one have to show that singlish is a "recent phenomenon" in order to qualify it as a "symptom of national identity"? In the first place, language is constantly evolving and given that singlish is not even formalised, is it any surprise that the present version of singlish has only come into mainstream usage in the recent years? But just to satisfy curious minds, a possible reason why singlish only came to be widely used recently is due to the changing social structure. the different races are a lot more integrated than before and the interaction spawned this trend?<br><br>that aside, there are several reasons why singlish is desirable. as argued, it reflects our tradition and multi-ethnicity, being an amalgamation of the languages spoken by the major races and dialect groups. At times, using singlish with a fellow countryman helps foster closer bonds by putting the other party at ease and breaking down barriers. On the other hand, adopting "standard english" may produce the opp effect.<br><br>someone mentioned about how singlish fails in communicating ideas effectively but this is ambiguous. obviously it will have to depend on who u are talking to. singlish is arguably a preferred language when communicating with someone of the older generation, someone who isn't too familiar with the english medium. peppering the conversation with certain singlish words helps. The whole idea of communication is to get the idea across. It is a tad childish to state that a particular language is better at doing that than another language, considering there are different types and classes of people with different preferences for languages.<br><br>Obviously terence failed in conveying his ideas to his audience, with people missing points etc...i am sure there are easier-to-understand ways of saying things but he simply chose not to for reasons one can only guess at. "It's hard to maintain discourse when one party doesn't understand points of contention. Gasp!" duh! the blame is partly on the originator when this happens. One might want to consider the good old method of having topic sentences, body and conclusion...or alternatively adjust the language according to the other party's aptitude instead.<br><br>It is saddening when u hear individuals going to the extent of saying things like we should refrain from using words such as "cheem". This particular individual has failed terribly to see that singlish has its merits and is therefore worth preserving. Just because a group of people employ singlish due to their handicap in english does not mean that singlish should be eradicated. It's akin to burning the whole of chicago just to rid a few gangsters. What is more impt, is to educate the people. There are many others who are able to switch effectively between proper english and singlish. The issue here lies in the generally "unsatisfactory" english standards of the population at large. Ideal solution would be to strike a healthy balance.<br><br>Moving on, one can't help but get the impression that some individuals here are trying extremely hard to impress and to exhibit an "intellectual" image. Just a few quotes to illustrate the point, "be better that someday you can engage us on the same level of language and critical thinking"...."inclined to believe that not most of the people here would like to engage in deep thought about the issues like some of us here" Not forgetting their "casual" mentioning of Dorian Gray, ALan Sokal, Zelanzy etc in a totally irrelevant context.<br><br>By the way prodigal, quoting from u "I encounter Scottish, Irish, American (with their own brand of American English), Italian, East Asians, and other races who speak English in their own accent. So, Singlish is not a just a problem for Singaporeans but for people of other countries as well"...u might be interested to know that singlsh isn't an accent.<br><br>bochup: it might be a good idea to be more discerning when it comes to picking your "english teachers" and practising caution at picking up "good" english. Grammatical errors etc are common in Prodigal's posts. Terence's aren't immaculate either.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maya,<br><br>Just for the records, I am not "offended" at all by the digressions and asides. I was just picking up on the side topic of elitism (brought up by someone else), offering reasons why some might think others here are elitists or elitist-wannabes. Also, I did not conclude in any way that anyone here is trying hard to impress. What I did say however, was that there are several reasons why some might get that impression. I am in no way drawing any conclusions. It is hard not to get these impressions when u have people saying things like "the last thing i want to do is to impress the cretins here" and "someone throw me an intellectual challenge please.........*yawn*"<br><br>As to whether "many" people are able to switch between singlish and english, I guess this will remain debatable until someone actually conducts a survey and produces figures. May I suggest that we just leave it at that since it seems the best we can do now is based on our personal observation (which can be highly subjective).<br><br>It would be helpful to point out exactly where u had cited your example done by a uni student cuz looking back at your posts, it is quite a challenge (at least for a cretin like me) to know what u were referring to.<br><br>lastly, i did not say that you, mayajade the Gorgeous Demoniacal Mermaid, said that singlish should be eradicated.

            <div class='col-md body'>Just to clear up several misconceptions before I address the topic of debate.<br><br>1. I never proposed myself as bastion of the English language. Nor have I offered myself as English tutor to anyone. IÂ’ll go even further to say IÂ’m not as proficient in English as I want to be Â– hence my own grammatical errors. However stereotyping and polarising are convenient ways for distinction and people automatically assume one is showing off or trying to impress whenever someone uses a large word.<br><br>2. I mentioned Dorian Grey as a side topic to Proddy and Maya because they both enjoy Oscar Wilde and it was a personal recommendation. I donÂ’t apologise for that.<br><br>3. "the last thing i want to do is to impress the cretins here"<br>Surely there must be some sense of context. I was previously accused by Mr Hata-San of elitism, snobbery and trying to impress Â– these accusations were of a personal nature and nothing to do with the case I presented. He cast my character in a particular light without even knowing me. I think I am entitled to a strong retort.<br><br>4.  and "someone throw me an intellectual challenge please.........*yawn*"<br>And contextualisation is required. Rinoa was repeating a point which I had previously argued against without showing any argument for it otherwise, and repeated from a moralistic stance at that. Her moral tone implied that again, I was elitist or snobbish, as such my reply served to reject her argument and be a parody of her tone. The fact that I was irritated for being attributed sentiments I donÂ’t hold also accounts for the abrupt brush-off.<br><br>(Rinoa and Hata-San, sorry for bringing you guys up again but it was necessary. Cheers)<br><br>And now for the topic properÂ…Â….<br><br>1. I was suggesting Singlish as national identity is an artificial construct. (Yes, I know other countries have artificially constructed national identity as well, but thatÂ’s not the point) Singlish may have evolved naturally through frequent usage but was co-opted by liberals in the bid to buttress a notion of nationhood and indigence to Singapore. I propose this took place in the 80s. My question was: if we rightly think that Singlish is a natural linguistic hybrid from the result of interacting ethnic groups, why wasnÂ’t it prevalent in the late 19th, early and right up to the mid 20th centuries? There is no evidence of increased ethnic interaction now as compared to then. Furthermore, Mandarin as an official language was only introduced in the 60s with the bilingual policy, as such the Chinese had one less language during the early periods to be centripetal to. I suggested that this co-option as national identity has made Singlish speakers, not proficient in English, i.e. by necessity and not choice, complacent.<br><br>2. No one disputes that Singlish is a comfortable medium. However I might disagree with Singlish being the preferred medium amongst older generations. Malay and Chinese dialects are preferred since most older Chinese can converse in Malay as it was the common language (or as I mentioned above, the lingua franca) then. Not many of the older generation (65 and above) are proficient in English, and Singlish employs a lot of English.<br><br>3. Â“someone mentioned about how singlish fails in communicating ideas effectively but this is ambiguous. obviously it will have to depend on who u are talking to.Â”<br>Obviously if you use Singlish with a fellow speaker, you will be understood but what is that compared to the rest of the world? Again, I reject the belief that Singlish is complex enough to carry sophisticated ideas trans-linguistically, i.e. to a non-Singlish speaker. Witnessing SÂ’poreans floundering with Singlish with international students in political theory seminars here has put paid to that hope.<br><br>cheers<br><br>------------------<br>I can resist anything but temptation.<br><br>Oscar Wilde</div>

And it is actually incorporated even in Singapore guides to aid tourists in understanding what Singaporeans is trying to convey.<br>Okay to quote what Lee has said...<br>"Lee has stirred things up by calling the national dialect of "Singlish" a handicap that is stifling the country's economic development. He lambasted TV comedies for popularizing Singlish, saying that wrongly leads Singaporeans to believe they don't need to speak proper English.<br>Singlish consists of clipped sentences like "you eat yourself, we eat ourself," which means "you eat by yourself and we'll do the same." The ever-present word "lah" ends many sentences."<br>Though English is the language of government and business in multiethnic Singapore, many of the 3.2 million citizens of the former British colony speak Singlish at home and with friends and enjoy local TV comedies featuring Singlish-speaking characters.<br>Lee may not be the top government official anymore, but his words still have the weight of an official decree.<br>Within days of his criticisms, the wheels of Singapore's media and education system, largely controlled by the ruling People's Action Party, were set in motion against Singlish.<br>Of course, PCk becomes the most targeted sitcom since it got popular because of its exagerrated use of Singlish.<br>Phua and his favorite phrase, "Don't pray pray" (don't play around), are being blamed for the less than perfect English of young Singaporeans.<br>"In trying to imitate life, Phua Chu Kang has made the teaching of proper English more difficult," Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said in a speech. "We cannot be a first-world economy or go global with Singlish." That is what our dear PM Goh laments that we cannot go global if the language keeps going on in support to what some of the forumites are trying to convey which I fully agrees.<br>The series ended its season in September with Phua promising to take classes to learn proper English so he can become a better role model for his impressionable young nephew.<br>In a further effort to eliminate Singlish, the government urged schools to maintain a higher English language standard.<br>The government, which has successfully affected public attitudes in a series of campaigns promoting kindness, courtesy, health and cleanliness, announced it will begin a "Speak Good English" campaign by early next year.<br>But some Singaporeans think this may be one campaign that fails with their traditionally law-abiding compatriots.<br>Several letters to The Straits Times, the country's leading newspaper, argued that Singlish helps connect the different races and languages. In addition to Malays and Indians, Singapore is inhabited by several Chinese ethnic groups that all speak different dialects.<br>At a recent writers festival, several poets and playwrights said local literature is richer with Singlish and its subtleties. Poet Alfian Sa'at said the anti-Singlish crusade "smacked of a colonial mentality" that would appropriate the American slang of Hollywood movies but not homegrown expressions.<br><br>So criticisms after criticisms, and finally with Singlish as our "literature"...it is an icon that unfortunately represents US, whether you like it or not.<br><br>P.S: I am not directing to anyone here, just my point of view of Singlish..and yes Hata-san , you are right in saying that I can switch back and forth from my Canadian English to Singlish effortlessly.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 03 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Wizard,<br><br>Unfortunately, I was locked out of the discussion because my server could not post things for the past two days, now that everything is okay, I can really come back to this discussion.<br><br>On your point about accent, perhaps, I did not make it clear. What I was purporting on my side of the House, is that people chose to speak English in their own ways. Now, it is not only accent, and also some words which the Americans, and other nationalities like the Scottish, Irish, Indian used like they make up some words that had mixed with their native language. Singlish is not the only phenomenon which occurred along these class of problems where an universal language started to propagate between civilizations.<br><br>First of all, it does not qualify as a symptom of national identity, because like what is happening in other countries, it could be see as an aberration to the language which needed to be integrated with the culture of the native nation itself. I agreed that the phenomenon of singlish is more a sociological trend, and it is disastrous to make Singlish into a part of Singaporean culture, if we look into a bigger magnitude of things, we would see that Singaporeans are alienating themselves off the world, and that would destroy the effort to go regional or even into globalisation.<br><br>I have stressed in my arguments that there is no such thing called proper English, but there is something called English where there is a set of proper ground rules which we need to follow. If everyone makes up his/her own version, and corrupts the language, makes it not understandable by others, then how do we communicate?<br><br>The whole point in this post, is about communication. What is it in a language which we can make communication effective? Singlish does not increase the efficiency or allow people to communicate properly. That is the whole gist of what Mayar, Terence and I would talk about here.<br><br>I think I am disgusted that you nitpick on the three of us namely Mayar, Terence and me because we mentioned books which we recommended to each other to read or say what we are reading. In the first place, Terence and I never claimed that our English are superior to anyone in this forum in the first place. When we discuss in a forum, we follow basic rules and use proper language in making our arguments. Some do not follow, and that is the choice made by these people. But when they are criticized, they don't want to admit to them and continued with the tirade of Singlish words. You can nitpick on a few grammatical errors we can make and I acknowledged those errors, because I am a human, and I can make errors as well. We would reduce to nothing but a semantic argument, which only some people whom I know are good at using but they have no logic nor argue properly.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Wizard,<br><br>I do not know what you have in mind, by quoting me out of context and interpret me as saying that I think that my English is far too superior than anyone. Before I would engage in this whole issue on nitpicking, let me put it as my disclaimer : I do not think that I am very superior than anyone.<br><br>There is a certain literary level before anyone can do a discussion properly. Let me give a specific example, for example, you cannot expect a 18th year old kid who have not learned English literacy to argue with you why Singlish is not a proper language. You can see it on 2 levels. The first level is about that you need a common ground for concepts to coincide, we need to agree with definitions to the motion, before we can fully engage. We can challenge someone's definition, if the definition that the proposition proposed is totally tautological or altruistic in nature. The second level is about understanding. We can write about something here in a different interpretation, and someone would interpret you different, and by quoting out of context without proper analysis is not something that is logical. There is a need to clarify about issues here. Without a common level of language, we cannot have a proper conversation because we are talking from different understanding of the whole issue.(In this light, I am referring proper English as in using proper rules to engage in discussion and you can discard the vocabulary, because anyone who do not under the words can always look up to the nearest Longman or Webster dictionary).<br><br>Come back to the nitpicking issue, what I was "disgusted" about, was you delibrately take a sideline issue (which was just friend to friend discussion on books), and infer delibrately on intellectual superiority. That is totally preposterous. So, are you saying that just because someone told me that I haven't read this book by Oscar Wilde, therefore, you are inferring that he is trying to show off the books that he know.<br><br>Let me adopt the way you argued and use it your way to interpret my post back on you now :<br><br>"Again, I think it would be a good idea to switch of the ego defence mechanism, lest u get "disgusted" easily and unnecessarily."<br><br>Then again, you choose to engage me again, by putting up my post, saying that I am subconsciously deluding myself, and added that it is a ego-defence mechanism. Then I become really bewildered about what you are driving at. First of all, you say that we have mistakes in our exposition of language (and I have no hard feelings of that and in addition, agree with your advice to bochup to read and analyse what we write selectively before making any conclusion), and then you insist that when we give our side of the story, you pinpointed it as a ego protection mechanism. I am sure that there are other reasons just to protect one's ego balloon from being deflated badly.<br><br>Actually, this discussion has evolved to resolve technicalities in arguments which is horrendously tedious for us to continue with it.<br><br>Perhaps, I am being paranoid or supicious, but the statements/arguments you put so far, are nothing about what Singlish is about. On the contrary, you are putting more time in trying to prove that Mayar, Terence and I to be egotistic bigots by quoting us and interpreting us in a different context.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Prodigal,<br><br>I did not quote you out of context when you said "be better that someday....same level of lang....". It is the tone one would adopt when talking to someone less superior and I just thought that a little humility might be desirable there. While u can deny vehemently that u do not, in actual fact, think that u are superior, sometimes unwitting comments like the one u made could suggest otherwise. In any case, we have had enough exchanges over this. I'll take ur words for it and it'll be a good idea to put this to rest.<br><br>I don't quite see why u should bring in all that about being on a certain "literary level" before being able to engage in constructive debate. I do not understand how a definition can be "altruistic" either. Only reason I can think of for u to say all that would be that u think my "literary level" is too low to be able to grasp what u were saying and hence, quoted u out of context?<br><br>With regards to the nitpicking...*sigh* did i not make it clear that it was just a suggestion that perhaps that's one of the reasons why some here might think some of u are just trying to impress? I did not conclude that just cuz u brought it up, u are being a poseur etc. It was just an attempt to bring to your attention, the possible effects these seemingly innocuous comments might have. Looks like I have failed terribly to convey this idea across despite making it pretty clear.<br><br>"saying that I am subconsciously deluding myself"....prodigal.<br>I have never said that u were "deluding" yourself or even hinted at that. If this isn't the defence mechanism, what is it? low level of comprehension?<br><br>To understand why I thought u were being overly defensive, all you have to do is take a look at why u called me a nitpicker when all I did was offering plausible reasons for why some people perceive u guys to be elitist. Me? Nitpicker? sheesh....so erm is this not the defence mechanism again? someone mentions something as a suggestion and u immediately jump to your own defense, countering it by calling the other party a nitpicker and pedantic.<br><br>"the statements/arguments you put so far, are nothing about what Singlish is about"...it is a pity knownig u didn't grasp all my earlier points.<br><br>Maya: alright I did misinterpret prodigal when he mentioned about the "cheem" part (assuming what he meant was that we should not stop short at learning just becuz things are deep). But in defense, check out his quote again "with the point on pinning on why we should refrain from using Singlish words like 'cheem'" If his real message was about the idea of not being daunted by "deep" stuff, then why didn't he just say so instead of specifically saying we should refrain from using singlish words like cheem? Is it any different if someone else uses the word "complex" instead of "cheem"? well no!!...so why the specific reference to "singlish words like 'cheem'"?? My point is, if Prodigal is unable to express himself coherently, whose fault is it that people read it differently?<br><br>Just for your info, I read the messages in this thread with interest (most of them at least) and I deny that I quote blindly without paying attention to the context. It is easy to argue one's way out of it, rationalising why one said a particular thing etc and as such, it is prob pointless arguing further with someone who wants to twist and turn out of a fix.<br><br>It is extremely easy to understand why one might infer that prodigal has a superior view of himself from his earlier comment ""be better that someday you can engage US on the same level of language and critical thinking".(note the word US) .... but in his latest posting, this guy who thinks he has a supposed ability to think "critically" says "I do not know what you have in mind, by quoting me out of context and interpret me as saying that I think that my English is far too superior than anyone".

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm, Wizard,<br><br>I would take it to explain to you that you have totally misunderstood two things and lifted my quotes out of context and interpret in a manner which I find it ridiculous. The next thing I am going to hear from you is that I "deny vehemently" about that issue about intellectual superiority.<br><br>I brought up the point about what is required in the people before they could engage in a constructive debate. I can justify in 2 reasons, because I think someone who can use the language properly, would be able to handle the discussion and understand the entire context of the discussion. A basic literary level is needed. There are always example, when a person have the appropriate literary level but intepret something wrongly  and worse, quote someone out of context and add their own salt and pepper to twist the truth into something else. The media of today are good at this.<br><br>The 2nd reason, I brought up why a common definition is needed in a discussion, because there is a standard we can adhere to, like some ground principles which we can start the discussion. I can think of a very good example of a good discussion which I have read in the recent post in the forum entitled "SNAG" between Ray and Terence, where the postmodernist discussions on Nietzsche are very well explained and exposited properly thru both Terence and Ray.<br><br>You said that you do not quoted me out of context and when MayaJade pointed out what you have done wrong, and you jumped to your own self-defence, saying that we are putting the burden of proof on you. It is intellectual dishonesty if you claim that you have read the posts and say that since when I have said something like that.<br><br>Let me illustrated the proof when I make the statement about refraining from using the words "cheem" (And here are the exact words from me in my post) :<br><br>[QUOTE] Singaporeans stopped at just saying that  "something is cheem" and do not continue thinking about the issue. It has a lot to do with the way we are educated. Because of the one-track mind we have gotten, we tend to stick to the exam books and not go beyond the subject. Being rigourous in a subject does not mean that one would end up to become ivory towers..... That is the fundamental point which I think, we are trying to drive at, with the point on pinning on why we should refrain from using Singlish words like "cheem".  [\QUOTE]<br><br>Then go and read what you have replied to both MayaJade and me. You would see what I am driving at.<br><br>There are some issues which I believed is to be distinguished. The issues about intellectual superiority, a proper discussion with the right literary level and quoting out of context are totally 3 different things and they are not related. The issue of intellectual superiority started from a few claims you made and we have already put out side of the argument. I have demostrated a good example of your actions earlier when you delibrately nitpicked Terence on the sideline issue about books. You can continue with this argument about we are trying to claim intellectual superiority, being defensive, or worse, feigning ignorance (the latest thing you want to put the label on me). You can insist still on us all these charges and I am not going to waste time to defend myself, before being accused of being defensive again. Then that is the other issue of quoting out of context, which is a fallacy of argument committed by you. As it is illustrated earlier in this post, so I do not repeat myself. So, don't mix these things together. Lastly the issue of having people with proper literary level to discuss things, is to illustrate the point why we should not embrace Singlish which is an aberration to the English language as something which is thought of as national identity.<br><br>If I have not make myself clear here, then there is nothing more to be said.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>Okay, I think this is getting out of hand. We seem to be defending our characters more than we should be defending our arguments on Singlish. The current strain of argument is more a play on semantics than ascertaining the merits (if any) of Singlish. For example in reply to WizardÂ’s charge,<br><br>Â“I undersand perfectly how you were "entitled to a strong retort" but is referring to the people here in the forum as "cretins" your idea of a "strong retort"?<br>aahhh context context....Â”<br><br>I could go: Yes, context, the all-important qualifier. And if pursued can similarly go Â– The retort, if taken in context, is addressed at those who accused me of trying to impressed, (all not being in the literal sense but a specific quantity), and if taken in context would be seen as irritated response to repetitive accusations, and if Â‘cretinÂ’ meaning Â‘stupid personÂ’ is again taken in context, applies to their actions, i.e. mindless diatribes, and not to their cerebral content. But this serves the debate proper no advancement. Context; tricky ainÂ’t it?<br><br>Lets address the debate.<br><br>Wiz: You want to refute my charge that Singlish as national identity has lulled Singlish-speakers by necessity (due to poverty in proficiency with English) into complacence?<br><br>Secondly, Â‘sometimes, you just want to convey some simple ideas and singlish does it better.Â’<br><br>Perhaps, but language is all we have for articulation and understanding. And according to philosophers like Barthes, entire consciousness is determined by language because we think and see the world with language. This hermeneutic argument asks an important question, and to put it in Â‘contextÂ’, the question will go  Â– Is the idea really simple or does the constraints of language make the idea simple? Singlish with its limited syntax and brutal delivery cannot convey complex ideas (I think we agree on that donÂ’t we?) and thus all the ideas it conveys are simple by default.<br><br>Rinoa:<br>Â“Poet Alfian Sa'at said the anti-Singlish crusade "smacked of a colonial mentality" that would appropriate the American slang of Hollywood movies but not homegrown expressions.Â”<br><br>The adoption of foreign terminology is quite a different topic from Singlish. I think SaÂ’at is a good poet but if he really said that then I disagree with him and you. I disagree with Â‘smacked of colonial mentalityÂ’ since colonial mentality is a fetish-nostalgia for colonialism while postcolonialism is not an outright rejection of colonial discursive practices (since it is a genuine part, though not sum total, of the consciousness of any postcolonial society) nor the striving to speak Â‘properÂ’ English. Do you not think that cultivating a certain aptitude for the language of commerce for economic and global wellbeing is the best way to rid ourselves of colonial oppression/baggage? If the anti-Singlish crusade makes us more viable and effective on a global scale why is it a colonial mentality? If Singlish is perceived as national identity and consequentially employed as a shelter for complacency surely weÂ’ll ultimately lose out. The ability to beat them at their own game (since it is more profitable) is a better way to shake off colonial mentality than dwelling in Singlish, making us only relevant to ourselves.<br><br>cheers<br><br>------------------<br>I can resist anything but temptation.<br><br>Oscar Wilde</div>
