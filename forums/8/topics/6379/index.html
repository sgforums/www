            <div class='col-md body'>i guess speaking the lingua franca gives one access to local social relationships and facilitates integration. however languages have strait-jacket tendencies. modes of thought, articulation of experience and interaction are conditioned by the language one uses. (see Roland Barthes)<br><br>singlish by default restricts reception and comprehension. its only cool to utter singlish but if you have an alternative grasp of a broader mainstream language, i.e. English. it maybe cool to postmodernists what with multi-narratives and all but using singlish for the want of better english as opposed to the ability to switch effortlessly condemns the speaker to a specific locality.<br><br>cheers<br><br>------------------<br>I can resist anything but temptation.<br><br>Oscar Wilde</div>

To assume we have ambidextrous abilities with English and Singlish is pure delusion. The attempt to speak good English is littered with grammar transgressions, blotching up past and present tenses, the list goes on. Singaporeans DO NOT have good English as safety net. I donÂ’t even need to talk about atrocious spelling Â– witness the brilliant Â‘rappingÂ’ when what I assume was meant was Â‘rapingÂ’ in one of thread titles.

It's funny how people flare up over the smallest things.<br><br>I agree with Terence that quite a number of people in Singapore speak only Singlish and therefore unable to switch in different situations like we think they should.  However English like Terence's is daunting and I had to read it twice to get the meaning.  However it doesn't mean that the content should be condemned just because of the presentation.<br><br>I have been thinking about the cause of the unpopularity of standard English.  The common reasons stated by my classmates are that their family is Chinese speaking and they speak Chinese to their friends, too.

What's wrong with indugling in a little singlish every now and then. Fine, my quality of spoken and written Queen's English might shamed the average Britons but at least i don't "impress" my fellow countrymen with ur way of writing and speaking. The Americans twisted and deformed so many standard English words that we now had two different spellings and pronunciation in the Oxford dictionary....and who is to say their's is the wrong one???<br>Poor english leads to lousy communications and toad-in-the-well situations....i agreed totally with u. The govt. policy of fostering bilingualism is not working out as well as they wants it to be but most ppl who went thru secondary educations can at least correspond with anybody well versed in either english and chinese.True, we might not speak like Taiwanese or Brits, but hey, the message does get across right. As for singlish, well, let's just say that it's something unique and special in the AVERAGE s'porean's mentality and psyche. In every corner of the globe, a leh or an alamak will instantly awake someone to the presense of a Singaporean.<br>Sigh....terence, not everybody is as fortunate as u, grabbing a scholarship and studying overseas. Do remember dear future leader, that there is more to ur country than ur cliques and collegues, theres' hundreds and thousands of us normal Singaporean slogging our life here, trying to make ends meet and do try to drop ur elitist behaviour.

            <div class='col-md body'>Ooo, do I sense hostility? Why is elitism always revived as counter-attack whenever someone disagrees with popular opinion? Anyway, it was not my intention to offend anyone; if I did, I apologise. However, there a few misconceptions.<br><br>1. Â“Fine, my quality of spoken and written Queen's English might shamed the average Britons but at least i don't "impress" my fellow countrymen with ur way of writing and speaking.Â”<br>Impressing the cretins here is the last thing on my mind.<br><br>2. Â“True, we might not speak like Taiwanese or Brits, but hey, the message does get across right.Â”<br>Get across to who? I can only assume youÂ’ve not witness a Singlish speaking SÂ’porean trying to articulate a complex concept to a non-Singlish speaker. ItÂ’s all right for superficial conversation but when the entirety and subtlety of complex ideas (business deals, explaining policies and theories) need to be conveyed Singlish does not Â‘get the message acrossÂ’.<br><br>3. Â“As for singlish, well, let's just say that it's something unique and special in the AVERAGE s'porean's mentality and psyche.Â”<br>So are kiasuism and peeing in lifts, lets celebrate those too! Hooray for civilisation. Furthermore, what is the AVERAGE SÂ’porean? I consider myself an average SÂ’porean too.<br><br>4. Â“Sigh....terence, not everybody is as fortunate as u, grabbing a scholarship and studying overseas.Â”<br>Do we really have to get personal? If we must then youÂ’ll be the first to know not all scholars speak the Queens English all the time, and conversely, not all non-scholars are comfortable with Singlish. The point I was trying to make was that it is a FALLACY to assume the average (that dreaded generic word again) SÂ’porean can switch from Singlish to good English. (Maya has pointed this out above) This assumption leads to complacency. Besides, I speak Singlish too. It would be ridiculous to imagine a Chinese SÂ’porean going to an Â‘Ah SohÂ’ in a hawker-centre going, Â“I say my good woman, would you be so kind as to serve my party and I with a round of your finest local coffee, black with just a pinch of sugar?Â”<br><br>5. Â“there is more to ur country than ur cliques and collegues, theres' hundreds and thousands of us normal Singaporean slogging our life here, trying to make ends meet..Â”<br>I do not doubt that nor am I blind to it.<br><br>cheers<br><br>------------------<br>I can resist anything but temptation.<br><br>Oscar Wilde</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, Mr Hata-san:<br><br>1)First of all, you are not being fair to Terence by accusing him that he is using bombastic English in his discussion, and also the fact that he is a scholar does not distinguish him (he is a cosmopolitan) from the rest of the Singaporeans. In very sad sense, you are using what I would call an ad-hominem, i.e. a personal attack. For your information, I am not even a Singaporean scholar and was educated in a Singaporean University, and I still use proper English to discuss the issues here.<br><br>2)For the second point onwards, I would also address the issue to all who is engaged in this discussion. Actually, I would first talk about the issue in view of my experience in my family. My uncle has always been very strict with me, and still I always defy him with my tirade of Singlish words like "Wah lau" and "lah" during any of the family dinners. I guess, it is just that I am talking to Singaporeans, and I would be a Singaporean when I spoke to my fellow countrymen. Now when I am here in UK, the Singlish bit just vanished without a trace from me. I don't even need to change at all. Somehow, when one is placed in a different environment, he must learn to adapt it. Similarly, if you are being placed in an environment in United Kingdom, you would lose the Singlish bit which would prompt you to adapt and communicate with people of other cultures.<br><br>3)This brings me to another point, in my University, I encounter Scottish, Irish, American (with their own brand of American English), Italian, East Asians, and other races who speak English in their own accent. So, Singlish is not a just a problem for Singaporeans but for people of other countries as well. As one of the fellows from my college who is a professor in English, he was commenting to me about the state of English in the world,"There is no such thing as proper English. To even advocate the notion of common English (a movement in 1950-1960s for British colonies to advocate speaking of English in the bare minimum level) is simply preposterous." He was telling me that he was surprised that Singaporeans speak very good English and asked when we started learning the language. He believed that the age where a person started learning language is important.<br><br>4)I am very inclined to agree with an article "Writing Proper English" written by our senior minister, SM Lee in the book edited by Sumiko Tan et al, "LKY : his ideas and views". The article is to encourage civil servants to write proper English. In his definition, it is just English which we can understand as well as people of other countries would understand as well. The thing is that there are proper rules in using a language, and if we keep twisting the rules, we also stopped ourselves from communicating properly. Surely, you don't want to end up in what a Chinese would call the cow's head do not match the horse's mouth situation. It is imperative that Singaporeans should learn to speak English as what it should be and not adhered to some twist or warped versions of it for 2 main reasons : (i)for communication and (ii) economic purpose.<br><br>5)Let me take the discussion to a slightly more new level : what is the purpose of having a common language? It is to communicate, and if everyone gives their own interpretation, it is no doubt clear that the language gets twisted and have its own flavour, but nevertheless, the rules of the language should not be changed. I am totally amused by people using statements "you are very cheem", "my England is not powderful" and etc. To me, it is just a childish notion, and people should just try to read more and improve their vocabulary. It is like reading a good story book, where the author displays a variety of statements and not just one statement with the word "nice" used all the time.<br><br>Well have a nice day<br><br>----------------<br>"Experience is the name that everyone gives to their mistakes."<br>- Oscar Wilde, "Lady Windermere's Fan"<br><br>P/S : Just tempted to quote it since I found another Oscar Wilde reader here..<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm, Terence:<br><br>I have to point out something which you miss here in Rinoa's post. What Rinoa is trying to say in her last paragraph, which I think was perfectly valid, is that what is the use of a language?

            <div class='col-md body'>I sincerely hope it was high school English what with all the grammar and spelling mistakes, but wait, it doesn't matter since this isn't an essay. Hey, what the heck lets all go crazy and speak Singlish, after all the world only consists of S'poreans. (Which I am and, according to Rinoa, understands the lingua franca by default. Another public service annoucement in stereotyping, tax free boys and girls.)<br><br>Proddy,<br>Her statement about communication is a non-starter. A language we use is for communication. I already argued that Singlish cannot carry the complexities and range of varied articulation. I also mentioned that communication vis-a-vis Singlish narrows down the audience. But happily she ignores all that in her adulation of Singish as communication. It's hard to maintain discourse when one party doesn't understand points of contention. Gasp!

Personally, I think singlish is a poison in the s'pore's society which needs to be cure. This may sound serious, but like what maya said, its spawn from plain laziness.<br><br>Proddy, u mentioned about the importance to start learning language at a young age. I can't help but worry that people will start taking English more seriously and the due to economic reasons, chinese is then cast aside as a 2nd language, just like what s'pore givt did last time.<br><br>If you look at youths of our generation, they usually hv atrocious chinese level, and distinctly lack the knowledge on chinese history and culture, which I always treat as our own culture.

            <div class='col-md body'>To Terence:<br>My sincerest apologies for indulging in what ur friend prodigal termed as ad-hominem. Perhap's it's the way u write and speak down to us people with a lower standard of English than u. This will be the last time i comment on individuals and i sincerely hope u will take it in ur stride instead of brushing it off.<br><br>1. The elitist character: Nope, i have nothing against ppl who holds different views as compared to mainstream (i myself does that often enough) but then again, this is not what i have in mind when i said that u are an elitist. U have this kind of attitude that u are superior and it shows in ur lauguage and thread, always putting us  minnows down with sarcastic remarks that took us hours to decipher.We are always seen as lower social beings unequal to ur intellect and status in ur views, (quote,: someone throw me an intellectual challenge please.........*yawn*) and guess what, a mere wrong spelling will elict a snigger and scorn from u. If this is not elitist, what is???<br><br>2.U are assuming everyone is toking business deals and explaining govt. policies to foreign ministers but hey, that only belongs to the minority. Us heartlander might not bump into foreigners everyday but if we do, ideas and thoughts do get across. We do not have to tell them what we think of the socio-political implications of the Straits relation between China and Taiwan in pure technical terms and believe me, "ang-mo" DO understand what we r toking about, notwithstanding all the "cheem cheem" term.<br><br>3.Ahhh , I see that u have a very low opinion of ur average Sporean, but thats not the point. The point is, average s'porean( my term, anyway) lapse into singlish every now and then, it's their underground language which comes to the surface in the market, coffeeshop and between close friends.<br><br>4.hmmmm, perhaps it's a fallacy to assume most average(yes,it's that annoying generic term again)S'porean can speak good english. But then again(lousy usage of grammer here), how do u define good english. To ability to convey my thoughts to the opposite party or the ability to give 12 different words that have the same meaning as socialism? (m i making myself clear???)<br><br>To Prodigal:<br>Very sorry if i gave u the impression of flaming ur good friend Terence.My sincerest apologies to u too....ok, back to the fray    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>1.ok, time to defute the meaning of the word "cheem". No, it is not used by people liked me to put down or snob (is that ever possible???) the more intellectually inclined ppl with their boombastic words. it literally mean that, :something that is beyond us."my England is not powderful" Childish, perhaps, but it's more like a satire to me,something to poke fun at people who slang like mad although they have never left Spore.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Improve vocabulary?? I agree totally with u, but then again( yes yes, the annoying phrase again)do we need to tok like sociologists or high-browed intellectuals.<br><br>To Bohcup:<br>blast me??? but for what??? I have nothing against guys like u picking up their language skills from people like terence and prodigal. Every person got their own unique way of writing and expressing their thoughts, again nothing wrong in that.I m not even asking them to CHANGE the way they write or to lower themselves to MY standard. All i m arguing is that for terence to take noticed of ppl's feelings in the way he reply to the threads. It is one thing to be sarcastic, but it's different ball game altogether if he "suan" other's in his intimidating and oh-so-mighty way of writing.<br>Cool off guys, not everyone is as intelligent as messr terence and prodigal.<br>As for ur grouch against Sporean youths and their cultural history....as u saying we have no history and culture too??? does this means that the Malays have to learn about Malaysia's history and that Indians have to take foundation course in The Making Of Modern India??? What then the Eurasians??? It is one thing to feel proud about ur own ethnic group but it's downright dangerous to be chauvinist about it.<br><br>To Rinoa:<br>hey, don't be dishearten by all the remarks. moi here also not clever enough to hold a debate with smart ppl, but u know what, as long as our points get across the the other side AND that they understand, it's fine with me.<br>Might appear like losers or Ah-Q to think this way, but what the hell, some are meant to be superiors while others follow meekly. Me??? i choose to be neither    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>*hata-san following Rinoa to her English Intellectual classes*<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim<br><br>[This message has been edited by Mr Hata-san (edited 28 February 2000).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by Mr Hata-san (edited 28 February 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Terence,<br><br>One thing I learned in newsgroup, sometimes, there comes a time, where people get into heated arguments because of misinterpretation of the points of contention, and also some of the remarks made, for example, "you are an idiot who suggest that" which gave people the impression of me being egotistic and being far more superior than others (which in reality I am not). Though I might be guilty of some of them, I am trying to use lesser opinions with degradatory remarks (unless, someone incur my wrath to flame him). I can understand your dilemma in this case, and I would urge that you can explain things clearly to Rinoa for she might be offended by some of your "offensive" remarks which might not be that in reality. Communication is something that is not to be taken lightly and is a very useful tool to our everyday life.<br><br>I have not read the Picture of Dorian Gray (who is the author?). I am busy reading Zelanzy's "Lord of Light", Benjamin Hoff's "The Tao of Pooh &amp; Te of Piglet" and also, an essay written by a physicist Alan Sokal, who was famous for what is know as the Sokal's hoax, entitled "Trangressing the boundaries", where he wrote a parody/spoof article to a well-respected sociology journal and then sent the 2nd article to them telling them that it was all rubbish. You can download Sokal's articles in the web. Do an altavista search with his name and you would get his website. Maybe we can discuss about that article.<br></div>
