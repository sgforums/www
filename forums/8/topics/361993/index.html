              <p>1) "There should be no problem, I used to do those when I was with company ABC.  Its melding them into new company's pace and work culture that might take some time and some work."</p>
              <p>2) "Anything else?  I got no problems with those you described.  Maybe need sometime to polish up the SAP/Autocad usage/speaking Hindi, since I have not used those skills for a long time"</p>
              <p>3) "Hmmm.....I will require some training on a main portion.  But the rest I am sure should be okay."  (This is of course, you were saying that you dont know the portion, but willing to take on training.)</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Interviewing is alway a natural skills, the rest is just how u dress up and present yourself, bull to those training, once inside the room, all gone case,.so it depend on who u r, what is the interviewer gender and grade, the job u are applying and of course the bargaining chips on the table in whether how much u need the job or how desparate they need you for the job.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Never fall into a spell of interview phobia, be what you are, just be presentable and if u got a good interviewer like me, i see your confident and body language more than what you are talking. Show yr confident and answer will automatically come into your mind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For the above question you just said</p>
              <p>"Oh, great job scopes (even if u dun understand but need the job), i believe i have no problem in adapting to it, but of course i still need your good company mentoring to guide me along the way, given my resumes and situation, the jobscope you presented suit me well, the rest is attitude and discipline which I am sure I got no problem in it, and you have all the right to judge me along the way."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then come the next bomb...the most important bomb. What is your expectation (salary)? Remember interviewers dun like to be question back, you try not to ask a interviewers unless you got the job.</p>

              <p>You either quote a last salary or tell them a slightly higher amount  (Maybe 100 more.)and mention its negotiable since you are comfortable with the pay relating to what you will be doing.</p>

              <p>Just tell honestly that time is hard and you are willing to take up any job.</p>
              <p>Divert their attention and stop them from asking questions such as "wIll you job-hop?" by talking about how you can contribute as a waiter/retailer with certain attributes of yours which stand out from other people.</p>
              <p>Most importantly, when they ask you your expected pay, answer something lower than others, and you win already.</p>

              <p>Obviously you shouldnt try to create an impression that you really want to switch career.</p>
              <p>It will seem like a lie.</p>
              <p>I think they wont ask you this question, usually for those positions, the turnover rate is quite high, it is normal for the workers to drop out.</p>
              <p>In case they really ask you.....just say honestly. But add the following positives...you will work hard, you will be punctual, bring in good results, adapt quickly, etc, please give me a chance.</p>
              <p>That will be better.</p>
              <p>Or alternatively you should try to find temporary or flexible jobs.</p>
              <p>Like one time I had an experience working in an auto-dealership in the back (admin), and luckily my boss allowed me to go to interviews, how nice is that. I told her since the beginning that Im looking for a job (another job), she said OK. So we had an agreement and an understanding. In fact a few times I took half-day leave to go to interviews in other companies.</p>
