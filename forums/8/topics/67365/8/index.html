As soon as they pass it, the man turns to his wife and says he knows what the next sign will say, and that he'll bet her twenty dollars that he's right. She agrees, and they drive on.

One of the children remarks on the fact that the sign is named after a newspaper comic.<br>After about five minutes, they pass another sign, which reads, "Golf Road". As soon as they pass it, the man turns to his wife and says he knows what the next sign will say, and that he'll bet her twenty dollars that he's right. She agrees, and they drive on. After passing the next road sign, the wife finds that her husband is right, and hands him twenty dollars.<br><br>What did the last sign say and how did the man know?<br></div><div class="quote_body">NSmen who didn't get this right should go serve another 2 more years!<br><br>--------------------------------<br><br>A Professor asked four students how long each of them had been studying.<br>One of the students replied: Â“We have all been studying a whole number of years, the sum of our years of studying is equal to the number of years you have been teaching and the product of our years of studying is 180Â”.<br><br>Â“IÂ’m sorryÂ”, replied the Professor after some thought, Â“but that doesnÂ’t give me enough informationÂ”.<br><br>Â“Yes, youÂ’re rightÂ”, agrees another of the students.

            <div class='col-md body'>One science question:<br><br>Sam Rottenegger got some free tickets to go and see his least favorite band. Sam, feeling a little unruly, stopped at the corner store so he could bring a 1/2 dozen eggs with him to the concert.<br>The concert was packed and the tunes where so loud that Sam could hardly stand it. He started making his way through the crowd when one of the eggs broke in his pocket and ran down the inside of shirt. Sam squirmed with disgust but thought how great it would be to see that yellow ooze on the band members.<br><br>It took him 60 grueling minutes to make his way close enough to launch his attack. Sam chucked one right at the bass player but it just bounced off him without breaking.<br><br>"Odd," Sam thought, but every one of the 4 eggs he threw just landed unbroken. He never got to throw the 5th as security removed Sam promptly. Sam, now half deaf, bruised, battered, and confused looked closely at the egg and noticed it wasn't exactly raw anymore. Frustrated, Sam chucked the egg over his shoulder hitting an Officer who gladly gave him a free nights stay at the Bars Inn.<br><br>So what happened to the eggs that caused them not to break? Note that they were totally raw when he brought them in.<br></div>
