Your man might love you very much, but that doesn't mean the truth won't hurt him.<br><br>If telling him the truth is going to make him less happy, then don't.  It's for the good of both of you.<br><br>Some of my gf who are married even had abortions before they met their husbands.  They decide to keep this dark secret to themselves and I totally agree with that.<br><br>Many a time, truth hurts the man, esp if he really loves you with all his heart.  He is not going to be indifferent to what you tell him, cuz he loves you very much.  IMO, it is not fair to let the man go thru this hurts.<br><br>sometimes ignorant is a bliss.  I'm sure you will want your man happy.  Right?</div>

I've known about cases where a 36 yr old TG ends up feeling like she's only 6 years old... If u can go for an op and avoid this "making up for lost time" syndrome, then why not?</div>

I used to think they were being narrow-minded and petty.  But later on in life, I realised that men can be very easily hurt by the women they love.  That is why, many married women choose to hide their past, or speak less of it as much as possible.<br><br>So if you really think you shld be honest, then you have to really do it very very tactfully cuz your case is quite rare and hence very sensitive.<br><br>But my advise is : Don't.   I am advising you like the way I will advise any of my girlfriends.  I was also told the same thing by older gfs before.  That's why I believe there is a good reason not to tell.<br><br>Let's say one day he finds out on his own your past.  He will of course be very very shocked.  Just like if I find out one day that my husband was ever married before and has kids with other women, I will be devastated too.  If the guy loves you, given some time, he will come to term with it.  This is provided you choose the right guy.  Right guy = good, nice guy who treats love seriously.  Just tell him straight that if u hide it from him because you love him too much that you are afraid to lose him.  But then, at any part of the relationship he's told the truth, the reaction will still be the same, be it he accepts or not.<br><br>Also, I saw from a HK serial that a transsexual murdered her ex lover who pestered her like hell.  Through thorough investigation, the police found out that she was a man before and this of course was revealed to her husband who knew nothing about it at first.  Her husband rejected her at first but later on out of love, helped her to escape arrest.<br><br>We may think this is just a drama.  But scriptwriters most of the time, write stories based on some facts in daily life.</div>

And yea, u need to educate him on what constitutes a gay. A Gay is a man who wants to love another man AS a man. I often tell many people, gender, gender-identity and sexuality are very independent issues. In fact, your sexuality is straight since u want to love men as a woman yourself. your gender-identity is female while your gender is Transgender/3rd gender.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>JennTS,<br><br>If you want to see a real life example of a happily married transsexual, there is one working at City Plaza (level 1) hair salon.  Not sure of the name, but the shop door is facing outside the building one, next to the entrance of the building.  I dunno her name also.  But heard that she gets along pretty well with her mother in law and her husband treats her very well.  Once, I heard that she even took leave to go out with her mother in law (this shows good relation between them).<br><br>But word of advise : It is sad to say this, but it is true that there are many, too many b astard guys out there.  Just be careful with ppl you meet.  I know of another transsexual who holds a good job in one big company.  She has been wanting to find happpiness but men all never treat her seriously because of her gender.  She ended up getting hurt all the time.<br><br>I think both are in their late 30s.<br><br>Just wanna show you the two extremes of how a transsexual's life can be.</div>
