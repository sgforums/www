Yes they do. Most caucasians prefer to dress casually in SG due to the heat.<br>9. There are many asian men who's table manners are better than caucasian's.<br>8. Nope. You should stop banging only the americans and brits.<br>7. More open-minded than a conservative asian culture, true. But asians who grew up in america are just as open-minded, yet they're not caucasian.<br>6. Ah! Finally we get to the truth. They're willing and able to pay you for your services, you mean.<br>5. True, but that's genetics. There are short caucasians too.<br>4. Huh? I know lots of caucasians who are working just as hard as other singaporeans, and earning the same salary. If anything, caucasians in SG get DISrespected by money-grubbing, gold-digging whores like you.<br>3. So do indians. Ever heard of the Kama Sutra?<br>2. Actually, asians average 5 inches according to Durex, with japanese the shortest at 4.5. Caucasians 5.75.<br>1. That's a matter of taste.</div>
