            <div class='col-md body'>sometimes i really think local females regardless of age, are too sensitive as compared to other countriy females whether developing or developed. when i was overseas, i noticed the females will not be sensitive and scared of men walking towards them in sunglasses or without looking straight ahead at them or behind them or on train seating besides them. but in local context when guys whether wearing sunglasses or not walking towards females looking straight ahead but definitely not at them but of course look infront if not kena fall down mah, or walking behind females as this is public road anyone can walk at own pace and anywhere, or on train seating besides a female while reading on mobile phone or gazing, all these passive actions will easily make local females regardless of age sensitive scared people will snatch their things or attack them or touch them meh? even in hongkong, i notied their place smaller than us but their females also ok mah but local females damn extremely sensitive, maybe because we are under the kiasu psychology so even mental state also kiasu people will everyday attack them so they prefer walk alone, seat alone, eat alone, everything alone, might as well live in ubin no body will come near you. take a chill relax lah, guys i noticed local or overseas no issue maybe guys have no sixth sense or senses not as active as women.</div>
