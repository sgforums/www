              <p>Then again it can be said u are not good looking urself.. thats why the good looking men never dare look at u to give u the wrong impression. Hence.. they steal glances. Not at ur face.. but at ur boobies. LOOL!</p>
              <p>Good looking confident men... stare... becuase they want u to know they know you know they know they are checking you out to see ur reaction. Maybe ur good looking friends are not as good looking as mine. hahaha!</p>

              <p>Whats wrong with calling them 'boobies' LoL! I like the word boobies... its so.. unrefined , cute and funny at the same time.</p>
              <p>Definately, but if a girl truly truly carries herself well and conscious about her standing in the community, she will NOT allow herself to be misconcieved in such slutty attires. Because for her to be so self - conscious about her 'name' she will not allow herself to be viewed as such.</p>
              <p>i like victoria's secret. The walk ways.. is not about the lingerie.. its abou the girls. hehe..</p>

              <p><br> Some good looking men are confident enough not to brag or remind
              others that they are good-looking. Some good looking men don't even
              think they are good-looking at all.</p>
              <p>Why do good-looking confident men need to check out
              better-looking confident women if they are confident?</p>
              <p>Oh I know, is it because those good-looking confident men are
              not really confident enough about their own good-looks?</p>
              <p>Is it because they are missing out on the 0.5 in their
              9.5/10 good-looks against the 10/10 good-looking women?
