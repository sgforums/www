              <p><br> So does your point of referring sg guys as poor dudes signify
              that Singaporean guys are UNABLE TO ACCEPT CRITICISM of any form
              from anyone, just like their beloved ruling party leaders?</p>
              <p>I agree if you are saying that Singaporean guys have grown so
              much attached and became so much similar to their idolised leaders
              who have crafted their beloved education system.</p>
              <p>I think we all know the true answer deep down inside our hearts.

              <p>No...  :S honestly, it was an expression. Its like seeing a wife bashing her own husband needlessly.. i just felt sorry for them.. ouch. hahaha. Sorry in a way instead of being loved by thier own... they are ridiculed. Its not like you are very up there also. Thats why i said..  'Poor dudes' the abuse they have to endure.</p>
              <p>But the way u say interpret it... is amusing. hahaha</p>
