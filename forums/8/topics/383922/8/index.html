              <p>One main reason why I chose to make things difficult for short ninja is because I KNOW he is not going to believe what I say even if I politely reply to his not really polite question.</p>
              <p>As a female forumer as you have claimed to be, why aren't you sharp enough to know that? Is it because you do not have enough experience with guys to tell the difference between the good ones from the bad ones?</p>
              <p>If claiming to be a real female like yourself requires the need to dull my brain and leave myself open to receive deceit from guys, then I'm happy to be a female and you can be the real female ~</p>

              <p>Because it does not work on disguising what you really are.</p>
              <p>One.  You are welcome to be a female, be it that you think you are much brighter then any real female.</p>
              <p>You are always welcomed to believe that others do not have the experiences with the guys like you did.  Its your life, your lies and your beliefs after all.</p>
              <p>And if you still wish to argue the fact that you are brightening up anyone's mind with your current postings, in this thread and this forum.</p>
              <p>Then so be it.</p>
              <p>BTW parn.  When you have to lie to everyone, even if its for you to rant and put other people down and get off some cheap thrills issues.  You are obviously not dealing well with your own self.</p>

              <p><br>The same can be said about you too, you are also welcome to be female forumer who is brighter than me to use a female nick.</p>
              <p>I'm not smarter than you because I did not foresee the risks of such accusations from all forumers and the irritating constant need to convince all retarded but possibly lustful people about my gender when I took over parn's male nick.</p>
              <p>I'm not more capable than you because I stubbornly refused to compromise myself to many forumers in here and instead believe in my own true opinions to the extent that I need to deal with nonsense repercussions from you and many other forumers who became jealous or felt threatened by my presence.</p>
              <p>Thanks for reminding me, I shall try to live my life in fears of facing more senseless repercussions from the many that I did not agree with and the many who felt jealous of the attention I'm getting and the many who felt threatened by my honest posts.</p>
              <p>I'm already living in fear of all of you <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png">, please leave me alone and please go soliciting some female nick forumers whenever you all are feeling lustful and horny ~ <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
