            <div class='col-md body'>Anywayz. I take it back Singapore has modernised or should i say become Americanised. Coz i see many students after the graduation ball renting hotel rooms and going up to spend the nite in the hotel rooms for 3-somes and stuff. So yeah ok, i admit it, in my book, SG can use the term prom =) although they still do not dance, although they bonk. Well whatever.<br><br></div>

But like 1 dude said earlier, it don't matter the terms and stuff, coz if they have a good time then its fine. I mean, also now, singaporean students lose their virginity at grad nites nowadays.. so i guess its on par with our westernised proms.</div>
