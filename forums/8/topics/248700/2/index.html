            <div class='col-md body'>In accounting, the starting pay is very low, but the pay progression is very good. And promotion is quite structured in the lower levels. Compared if you start in the bank with 3-4k. The yearly increment is 3%, 5% or 7%. Of course there is the big annual bonus of 6-12 months. And commission if you are front line staff. But, not all bankers get the high flyer positions of trader , analyst , private banker or investment banker. Most get stucked where? back office and middle office.<br><br>At back office and middle office, you can work for 5 years but still remain unpromoted. Then when the space above you get vacated, they hire someone from another bank.<br><br>In the first ten years of your career, progression is the most important factor. If you start off in a Bank, you have to really be very good. If not, after 5 years your audit counterparts will catch up with you - Both in terms of progression as well as pay.<br><br>Contrary to expectations, first class honors students do go to public audit firms. I have a friend who is breaking his bank scholarship bond to start of in public audit. He is first class honors. And btw, he took the 2.2k offer instead of 2.5k.<br><br>I don't know how many of you reading this forums actually know how it is like applying for jobs. First class honors is really no big deal. There is really a big difference applying for back-middle office versus front-office positions at the big banks. For the top jobs, the banks are recruiting by region. Asia-Pacific, Europe, America. Most of the time, you compete with those ivy league colleges.<br>They only recruit one or two per batch. And most top grads apply for at least 7 jobs. So if you are not the top, you have to wait slowly for your turn.<br><br>By the way, the working hours in banks are worse than audit. At least audit have on peak off peak seasons. Lawyers work longer hours than auditors. Doctors work longer hours than auditors. There is no such thing as 8-5 for professional jobs.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ntugrad:</div><div class="quote_body">In accounting, the starting pay is very low, but the pay progression is very good. And promotion is quite structured in the lower levels. Compared if you start in the bank with 3-4k. The yearly increment is 3%, 5% or 7%. Of course there is the big annual bonus of 6-12 months. And commission if you are front line staff. But, not all bankers get the high flyer positions of trader , analyst , private banker or investment banker. Most get stucked where? back office and middle office.<br><br>At back office and middle office, you can work for 5 years but still remain unpromoted. Then when the space above you get vacated, they hire someone from another bank.<br><br>In the first ten years of your career, progression is the most important factor. If you start off in a Bank, you have to really be very good. If not, after 5 years your audit counterparts will catch up with you - Both in terms of progression as well as pay.<br><br>Contrary to expectations, first class honors students do go to public audit firms. I have a friend who is breaking his bank scholarship bond to start of in public audit. He is first class honors. And btw, he took the 2.2k offer instead of 2.5k.<br><br>I don't know how many of you reading this forums actually know how it is like applying for jobs. First class honors is really no big deal. There is really a big difference applying for back-middle office versus front-office positions at the big banks. For the top jobs, the banks are recruiting by region. Asia-Pacific, Europe, America. Most of the time, you compete with those ivy league colleges.<br>They only recruit one or two per batch. And most top grads apply for at least 7 jobs. So if you are not the top, you have to wait slowly for your turn.<br><br>By the way, the working hours in banks are worse than audit. At least audit have on peak off peak seasons. Lawyers work longer hours than auditors. Doctors work longer hours than auditors. There is no such thing as 8-5 for professional jobs.<br><br></div></blockquote>very informative indeed, thanx! btw, howcome ur fren accept 2.2k? he rejected 2.5k or not offered 2.5k?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Whether it is 2.5k or 2.2k it is still really bad pay. He was offered 2.5k but he took the 2.2k offer from another firm. I also did the same.<br><br>There are several things that you need to consider as a public auditor choosing to go to a big 4 firm.<br><br>There is a tendency to stereotype different firms.<br><br>I shall not refer to them directly but:<br><br>One of them is known to work you the hardest. Welfare is supposedly very bad and you cannot claim your full OT allowance. But if you look from another angle, welfare is bad because it is growing very fast. And because welfare is bad, there is a shortage of new entrants resulting in a negative spiralling effect. The good thing is that if you are willing to work like crap, that firm has one of the fastest promotion route towards partner. The culture there is one of "you can do/get anything you want to if you are good enough". That firm offers 2.5k.<br><br>There are two of them who are very big and very well established. Big and established means more structured audit programs and training etc. One of them is known for giving very good welfare. Good welfare does not mean shorter working hours. Everyone works like crap when peak comes. Good welfare requires a genuine concern for your staff. Small things like, 1 extra day off a year, slightly larger dental coverage, drink machines that dont require you to put coins in ( i.e free drinks !! =) ), less stingy requirements on taxi claims and OT claims... do count. Our generation nowadays, pay is not everything you know? Genuinely care for us and we can show you a work ethic that pay can never compensate.<br><br>All the 4 firms are good. If not, why are they the big 4 right? It is selecting the firm that has the best culture fit for you that is important. 300 dollars... it is just another consideration point.</div>

Good luck!<br><br>Anyway I hope they increase it too. If there were more public audit firms.. maybe the pay would be much higher. Before it was increased.. it was 2k. If you go and divide out the pay by hours.. you are getting paid less than McDonalds.<br><br>One thing why pay is kept at this low rate is partly because of the BIG 4 monopoly. When they combine to set pay, they are effectively the market demand.<br><br>Awhile ago, Acc grads dont really have much of an alternative. Eventhough the pay suck, where else can we go right? We need to work 3 years in public audit to get our CPA qualification.<br><br>These few years the economy boom.. banks suddenly become so attractive. The pool of auditors getting smaller and smaller. No CPA nevermind, we can go banking route. Then the big 4 revise their pay to 2.2k. Still not enuff auditors go public audit. Then they start to engage in price competition with each other. One firm offer 2.2k first, then secretly send a seperate letter revising the pay to 2.2-2.5k. What do you think the other 3 will do next?<br><br>This is good news for auditors. Once the big 4 start bidding competitively.. our pays will definitely go up. Do you know how much the BIG 4 actually charge clients for our hours? Hehe... you dont wanna know..<br><br>Btw, when I was studying in Europe. The pay there was around 4000 euros. Euros = sg currency x 2. Of course it is different standard of living la. But no matter how u calculate there is much better la. BUT BO PIAN LEH, our gahbermen is pro business owners leh.. want to form union protest also illegal. If cost of labor go up .. will the ang moh MNCs still come here and kio cheap labor? Nope. =) Pardon the singlish... i really hate typing in proper english when I dont need to..</div>
