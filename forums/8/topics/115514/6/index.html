As Uncle Harry will ask, "what are your actions?"<br><br>By the way, for some of the disbeliever / ignorants out there, the best way to know if cost of living in Singapore is too high is to ask the people on the streets. Talk to people in coffee shops or taxi drivers.<br><br>By the way, from the Career Guide 1994, I read that starting salaries in 1994 is not half of the starting salary in 2004. But look at the public transport fares, they certainly has more than doubled.<br><br>Also when you read the Straits Times, do becareful of what was written. ST will write, every year mean house hold income increases -&gt; Yar right, thats because the children are staying with the parents and are marrying later and later (and thus moving out later and later). These old children also contribute to the household income.<br><br>But we have to count ourselves lucky. For in the early 90's inflation was even higher! <a href="http://www.mti.gov.sg/public/PDF/CMT/NWS_crc93.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.mti.gov.sg/public/PDF/CMT/NWS_crc93.pdf</a> Read page 2 of the report is enough.

I do not know if The student was polite, but even if he wasn't, i do not think he should attract flak over it. Why?  Coz he opened himself to attack when he stood up to speak  in front of the media. I imagine the adrenaline would cuase his to appear belligenret. After all, he is not a seasoned politician. True, if he was discourteous, he should be advised to change, but beyond that, its a non issue.   </strong><br><br>And as for what you were saying below, if a LKY doesn't want to listen as you have said, then why did he bother to set up such a dialogue session?<br>Everyone might as well go home and sleep if that is the case.<br><br><strong> Exactly my point. </strong><br><br>And what he said is right,  if you have a criticism or a problem DO SOMETHING ABOUT it. Otherwise you are just a bunch of hot air and nothing else.<br><br><strong><br><br>I wonder why we elected a government into office, if not to solve problems, or at least to seriously consider problems. Challenging a person who has pointed out flaws in the system is childish, and is not indicative of a person who is open to criticisms. Also, he DID do something about it. He told Harry that there were flaws in the system that were susceptible to abuse<br><br>I would also say Harry's challenge to do somehting is so simplistic as to make him look stupid.<br><br>The newspapers are controlled, the Media is controlled, and even if one were to contest in teh elections, you;re forgetting that the law in its current state stacks the odds VERY HEAVILY against the challenger. For instance, one has to put down a substantial deposit that one will lose if not enough votes are gained.<br><br>One is also open to being sued in defamation. This is a very important point, because firstly, in order to garner support, one has to speak publicly. A slip of the tongue and you might find yourself having to pay substantial damages. You can argue that this works boths ways but that is not a good argument because suing in defamation requires a lot of time and money. Harry, and Hsien Loong are richer than the vast majority of the population.  Further, as already mentioned, the Sh1t Times can hardly be called neutral. This is seen when it, as far as i know, gave a grand total of ONE paragraph to reporting a change in our constitution in relation to the reserves. Further, while the incumbent has the advantage of publiczing its policies through the Sh1t times, the challenger has to find some other way to disseminate his ideas. The challenger can set up a website, but hey, so can Harry n Co.<br><br>These factors mean:<br><br>1. You will likely have to be financially well off to be a serious contender.<br><br>2. If you are rich, are you willing to risk your wealth?<br><br>Conclusion: In my opinion, Harry Lee shows his propensity to bullsh1t when he told the student to challenge him. </strong><br><br></div>

So far, there are about 800,000 to 850,000 units of HDB flats in singapore now. 95% of legal transaction were done by the well known law firm.

            <div class='col-md body'>Can you just name us the Law Firms that Lee Kwan Yew has a stake in?<br><br>Edit: Did some Googling. All i came up with was the law firm of Lee &amp; Lee.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"> Originally From: SGEzine, 'Who's Doing What', http://sgezine.com.sg/people/0104people.html.</div><div class="quote_body">Dennis Lee Kim Yew, 78, co-founder of the law firm of Lee and Lee, brother of Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew...</div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="quote_from"> Originally From: Lee &amp; Lee, 'Introduction &amp; Firm Profile', http://www.leenlee.com.sg/Main_Profile.htm.</div><div class="quote_body">On 1 September 1955, Lee &amp; Lee was founded by Lee Kuan Yew, Lee Kim Yew and Kwa Geok Choo.<br><br>While Lee Kuan Yew went on to become the Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Kim Yew and Kwa Geok Choo took over the reins of the fledgling law practice and turned it into one of the largest law firms in Singapore.</div></blockquote>Now, i want to say that i am in no way implying, directly or indirectly, that the Firm's success has anything to do with LKY. In fact, as seen in the excerpt above, LKY left the firm when he became Prime Minister. His brother, as far as i know, was not holding any public office. I also want to make clear that i am not suggesting that LKY has any stake in the Firm; i simply do not have the resources and know-how to find that out. Perhaps someone in the Business field would be willing to find out? I am quite sure that there must be a Singapore compnay registries that lists who the main stakeholders in a coy are.<br><br>Well, at least we know that LKY is quite the entrepreneur, setting up a law firm in the 1950s!<br><br></div>
