            <div class='col-md body'>Jamie Han is simply another person from another generation, different from that of LKY. Values are different then and now. Just a pity that Jamie Han cannot see this point. We should not use values that we have in this 21st century environment to judge a person whose actions affected people from another era in the mid 20th century. It is no point calling LKY a despot or anything else, because nothing can be achieved from it. I dont see how anyone, including Jamie Han himself, can benefit by calling LKY a despot.<br><br>Just my 2 cents worth.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Whether Jamie Han is irreverent is up to you all to decide. What Im concerned about, is why some people here seem to get the idea that Jamie Han called LKY a despot.<br><br>If u all say Jamie Han is irreverent, it's ok to me. But if some people get the idea that he is irreverent because he called LKY a despot, then they misunderstood, and I want to clarify.<br><br>Jamie Han never called LKY a despot.<br><br>Directly, Jamie Han didnt say it. He didnt say "LKY you are a despot." or anything like that. So if anyone of u think he directly said it, you misunderstood.<br><br>How about indirectly? Was Jamie Han indirectly implying that LKY is a despot?<br><br>Did Jamie Han's action of bringing up the issue of despots and the need for checks and balances, in front of LKY, mean that he is saying LKY is a despot?<br><br>Please remember, Jamie Han was discussing and participating in an intellectual exchange in a University in a public setting/ forum. He mentioned about despots in general and the need for checks and balances. This was a discussion, a suggestion, an expression, an idea. This was all in the setting of an intellectual exchange. He didn't mean to imply that LKY is a despot himself and personally attack him. This is where many people here get it wrong and get the wrong idea.<br><br>Please read ST article dated Wed, 2 Feb. He mentioned clearly himself, at no time was he directing his comments personally at LKY. Please also read the Tue, 1 Feb ST article about the exchange.<br><br>After reading those articles, u can see clearly he was not directly or indirectly calling LKY a despot. I couldn't understand why some people think otherwise. This is a misunderstanding and is baseless.<br><br>If u all want to know more, go to ST website and read, or watch CNA this Sat.
