LKY was cool about it though and asked whether he ever had any views oppressed, and whether he had written any letters to the straits times forum. the han guy said he did, but so far only one letter got published. LKY then said the han guy could set up his own publication, write in to any of the NUS student magazines, or set up his own website even. there were so many viable options out there which the han guy hadn't even attempted before he spoke up. it must have been humiliating because he cut off LKY at mid-sentence later on with "i don't think you have understood what i meant, or answered my question. i don't think there's anymore to say" and strutted off. haha!....."</div>

Please lah the writer re-phrase the wordings and contexts as he wants. But I dun blame him, it is after all a blog. Don't take it seriously.<br><br>If u wan credible source, read ST articles online, and watch the CNA video urself. Regarding CNA video, if u all cant find, then I tell u right now, Jamie Han never called LKY a despot, directly or indirectly.</div>

He is a politician, if one thinkgs that he has implemented a number of rules that are draconian, unnecc and downright silly, why should one not call him out on his bull shi.t?<br><br>Further, was it even a dialogue? Its like a tiger talking to a lamb ; the tiger doesn;t have to listen, as LKY demonstrated; in the face of criticisms, he basically said "DO something about it".<br><br>That demonstrates an unwiullingness to listen, and is totally unconstructive. I guess you're right - he's not there to listen to criticism. Why is he there then?  To listen to ppl say "OOoooh Greeat one, we are honored to have you here"?<br><br>Well, you know what, if he wants to feel good, i suggest he masturbat.e. Its more convenient.<br><br></div>

If you don't I have friends..." other than perhaps his kind attempt to lighten up a tense audience.<br><br>Next, the fact that the audience laughed and applauded seems to reflect a simple-minded audience who have no knowledge that major media in Singapore are controlled and are joining MM Lee in lightly and heartfully chiding Jamie's comments. The majority of the audience are undergrads who are supposed to be knowledgeable, smart, etc, etc.... So much for NUS being betta than Princeton or Cornell in the Social Science category.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From the posts on this thread, it is evident that we Singaporeans take great interest in our political scene. ItÂ’s just sad that most of us have become conditioned to be subconsciously afraid &amp; apprehensive on actually speaking up when it really matters...<br><br>In public speaking, you only have one chance to get your word across &amp; can't take back what you have said. Jamie Han was able to hold his composure and not flinch even when challenged. He got his message acrossÂ… he had a valid opinion that appealed to the masses from the applause he received after ending his question.<br><br>I'm just disappointed that MM Lee replies were less than encouragingÂ…<br><br></div>
