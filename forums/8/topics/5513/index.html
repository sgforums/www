I'm really alarmed by what you just posted, please tell me you're kidding when you actually thought of it...<br><br>But anyway, just to dispell the myth, no, i don't think girls particularly hate computers, some i would say, love it.

            <div class='col-md body'>Females do like computers to each of their own extent, some may just like to fiddle with the files system, play games on it, do their work or other miscellaneous stuffs.<br><br>But if you are a person who simply loves computers it is nice if you can find someone who greatly loves computers both the interior and exterior, software and hardware. But it would not be a good idea to go around telling people how great this week's batch of pentium chips are, and how much they can be overlocked and therefore conclude there is no rain or weather conditions therefore possible producing such well chips this week. Or go around telling people about how 8086 started then talking about memory allocation like fixed partions, paging methods or virtual memory swap files. It will probably bore or kill the person  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, all you guys are right (what about the girls ??)....in that girls only use the programs on the computer but don't really get "into" it !<br><br>The girls around my age group (19 to 23) all seem rather "blur" about computers (this is a general statement based on what I observed in my University). Usually they use it because they have no choice (like project etc...) either that or they want to irc. Basically I never heard of a girl playing games, downloading upgrades and receiving files.<br><br>There are girls on the irc I met who don't even seem to know how to do a find/search function when I sent them a file. Moreover, some actually don't even know how to OPEN the file ! Sounds serious huh ??<br><br>There have been other girls who are clueless about Microsoft Word and Excel (supposedly the most user-friendly programs as compared to Microsoft Access, Frontpage and Project). Most girls are also downright blur about file names, RAM, file types, modem speeds and other seemingly "basic" facts that help us to use the computers everyday.<br><br>Most girls I know also don't keep up with technology much. The most clear example is the MP3 format, which many girls still ask me: "How do I play this song..I double click on the file and nothing happens !"...but duh ! Of course lah...cos you don't have the software to recognise the file type !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Others are plain blur about how to download stuff..just a simple right click on a picture or a link for an .mov or .mpeg file and save the link ! Sounds like I am giving a computer lesson hahah  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>To conclude, let me say that not ALL girls are blur ! Some girls I know are even better than me ! They score A's in their IT subjects, know how to set up the CPU and wow...even know more shortcut keys than me !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Take care all !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>excuse me?? we lack the intelligence? ever heard of a "LACK OF INTEREST"? MCPs like you just irk me. just cos we dont marvel at every little nitty-gritty bit of the comp doesnt mean we're stupid, just tt we dont have the patience or the interest to read every freakin pg of comp manuals. most girls are blur because they just cant be bothered to go and learn. they thk, "comps, ewww, how boring, ask my kor/bf/bro/father/tech support then can liao lor..." does tt mean we're intellectually inferior to comp nerds who can recite every single component in a comp, the uses, where you can buy it, how to fix it, when it's made, etc.? if you really thk so... i pity your gf. or any ger ard you.<br><br>god, how i hate MCPs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey DNS error you are wrong about the part "girls lack intelligence to fiddle" when it comes to computers. There are plenty of females who can match up and surpass alot of guys when it comes to things like computers, in both aspects of software and hardware. I'm so sure of this because I studied IT modules before and many of the females perform so much academically better than guys. I have substantial knowledge of computers just to keep my head above waters when it comes to computers, but I still hate stuffs associated with computers a great deal. And personally, its not very nice to critcally condemn females in this topic. Unless you yourself is a computer genius, you'll gain the right to comment..but still, not condemn them  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>As for ataraxia, keep it cool  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>Have a beautiful day.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok, the "lack intelligence" bit is really getting to me. talk abt sweeping statements! I'm getting the pic that things haven't changed much since the stone ages. C'mon! What kinda crap is that? Lacking intelligence? Where on earth did you get that from?<br><br>I think the reason why girls are not as aquainted with their PCs/Macs is cos as females, we prefer the human touch, which (oh surprise!) the computer lacks. Obviously, as different as our reproductive organs are, we too are geared towards different things. So yeah, i agree with axtaraxia, some girls just cannot be bothered simply bcos they have slaves, ..opps i mean bros,bfs,etc to help them out of a computer glitch. But for every 5 that "only use it for ICQ,IRC and tok abt XXX", there are at least 3 who are computer savvy. OK so maybe they can't build their own computers, but hey! that's what Funan Center is for! As for the guy who says "that's why windows crash more often when guys use it", well, ok, granted, you push the limits (typical guy thinking), then again, it may be a virus! hardy har *okok, i'm kidding*<br><br>Different people, different perspectives, but I'm very concerned abt where the "Equality of the Sexes" debate is going in Singapore. It seems to me even the most educated can't let go of the "male superiority (if there is sucha thing!)" midset, and this is decades after the whole bra-burning episodes. I am beginning to wonder abt the whole theory of evolution, if we have really evolved, it sure did very little for our way of thinking.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Exterminator, you claim that girls go blur when they are asked about computer hardware and software stuffs, have you ever thought why guys dont go blur over these kind of things although they dont know what is going on also? As a guy myself, i know why some of the reasons are so<br><br>Hard to admit something that you do not know, yes alot of guys do not like to admit that they do not know something because of their strong self esteem and ego.<br><br>Seldom admits that they do not know what is happening, ever see a guy that promises to do something for you but screws up so badly although you can see it he will just tell you everything is under control although he is panicking already?<br><br>Not many have a perference to show their faults or blunders just because they want to save "face". Ever went snowboarding with your male and female friends and theres this guy desperately trying to attract the attention of this girl, trips on the way boarding down taking a few hundred tumbles down then landing face flat, body aching and probably fractured a few but can still stand up and say "Don't worry guys im fine"<br>while a female would probably stay down and admit that she broke a few bones in the process and is hurt.<br><br>another 2 cents of mine  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
