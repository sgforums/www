            <div class='col-md body'>on my wedding day. er, if i ever get married, that is.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>i know i shouldnÂ’t judge but itÂ’s difficult not to, below is an account of what i saw and how i felt:<br><br>recently i came across a wedding couple in a car, they were sitting apart, not close together, with each looking out of their respective windows, i smiled at the bride and she smiled back and i felt a little sad for her because for that few seconds i think she would have love it if her husband had spoken to her or even turned to look at her. btw, he wasnÂ’t looking too happy, kind of pissed in fact.<br><br>as i walked along, i saw them again, this time at the entrance of the hotel, getting out of the car and getting stuff out of the boot. the husband neither helped her nor assisted her up the steps and mind you, her wedding gown has a train and she had a few dresses to change for the banquet, well, those were taken care of by the bellboy but she still had her bouquet and a paper bag that contains the more useful items i guess which she insisted on carrying herself when the bellboy offered to help her, so with one hand clutching the bag and bouquet and the other holding her long train, she Â“struggledÂ” to walk. the groom had a paper bag and a sling bag and not once did he offer to carry the brideÂ’s paper bag, neither did he wait for her, he just went straight ahead, well, occasionally, he did turn around and see whatÂ’s keeping her but his expression wasnÂ’t one of joy or concern, more like irritation.<br><br>i canÂ’t help but just feel that, hey, i donÂ’t want or need a guy like this if i ever get married. itÂ’s my wedding day (er, itÂ’s his too but you know, itÂ’s more like mine   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">), the least he could do is make me feel loved, pampered me a bit. is that too much to ask? after marriage, roles are likely to be reversed and the lack of warmth in his eyes for her, that made me feel a little cold, if my love one looks at me like that, iÂ’ll just die a little. would i run out on the wedding? i donÂ’t know but i know i rather be happy single than miserable married.<br><br>of course i donÂ’t know that exact status of the coupleÂ’s relationship, i may be too judgmental but in context of what i saw, this was how i felt and how it contrasted with another scene i saw, also recently, this time in the lift of a hospital.<br><br>the lady in question was lying down on the trolley bed on her way to the Radiology Department, the open look of love and trust she has for her husband or boyfriend, the warmth, you can just feel the love shining from her and his same look for her, the way they reassured each other, it was embarrassing for me to ogle for it was so genuine and it made me really envious, made me wonder if iÂ’ll ever look at a guy the same way and him too the same way at me. er, irrelevant detail here, but she smiled at me too and i felt happy, of course it helped that sheÂ’s beautiful to look at. i returned her smile, of  course.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>two different couples, two different emotions, thereÂ’s no prize for guessing which relationship i rather be in.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by colette (edited 01 October 2000).]</div>
