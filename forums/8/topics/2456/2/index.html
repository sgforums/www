If not a love relationship wouldn't be stable further more if u understand that person u will come to a finally decide whether is he/she suitable for u or not. If u at love at 1st sight the best is just control urself spend more time together if possible then start to communicate more give him/her more time and to urself too don't rush. As u may notice many singaporean divorce rate is getting high due to love relationship unable to solve or maybe i could they don't really understand each other.

The wonder Singapore divorce rate is getting high up then the marriage rate. I really feel so pity for those people, if u really love this person at 1st sight better control urself check it out do not chose bindly of course requirement don't ask to much lar. Then best is check out everything before u do the last is decision.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just a few advice for you young people out there:<br><br>1. if you want to look for a life mate, make sure that you at least share some common interests<br><br>2. for those who like to chong disco or pub, make sure you find a bf/gf who also like to chong (with you)<br><br>3. never take your bf/gf for granted, make sure you tell him/her how much you appreciate what he/she has done for you<br><br>that's all for today (night?)</div>

He is so urge that he kept on asking u : "peiyi can u be my girlfriend?" and u will reply : " let me think 1st, ok?"<br><br>Usually this kinda things very common in order u wanna know whether he loves u, u got to test him, and he got to prove it to u. sometime when some other guy instead of asking for ur love they might think of asking u for sex. For instant they'll urge to so imapaitently asking whether can u be either on of their girlfriend, that's mean something is going wrong.<br><br>So like wise test them dun be a blind man without walking stick with u..........</div>
