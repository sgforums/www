            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>I came to this forum form early November last year, form that time, I almost kicked into this forum as long as I can access to the internet. I think no much people can stayed for so long. I witnessed many people coming in and many leaving this forum. Due to involving into one of the flaming threads, I think I have to speak up so share my feelings to this forum. if u have time, you can keep reading, it will be my serious post.<br><br>Last November, when I came in, I saw that some people started to organize their first outing. I was excited as them just like myself taking part in it because most people focused on checking out the most youngest, outspoken and active female forumite. I was also curious about everyone in this forum especially for that gal.(better don't list others' name, the old forumites may know what I am talking about) . but the first outing was definitely failure due to some communication problems. But the people did not give up, tried to organize outing and made friends outside the forum. And as more and more people came in and joined the outings. As if someone made a group of friends in this forum, I can say I am the "witness" for your friendships. Some may knew each other in the real life before the outings, but some just through this forum. right?? hope I am not wrong.<br><br>I can say the forum help linking group people together and it is one of successful achievements. Why so many old forumites can make friends through the "words" communication? I think it due to many factors but not without the respect, care and trust to others. These friendships are appreciated, and it is envious for me because I never can be one of their friends in the real life. Most people gave me good impressions, and I also introduced this forum to other friends and told them I have very good impressions to you Singaporeans. But seems many people are leaving or already left. As a loyal reader to this forum for so long time, I feel a bit regretted that I did not join posting here, I might also can make friends with some of them who I admired. I like most posts, not only the intellectual "products", but also the small daily matters and joys that people shared with.<br><br>This forum to me just a free entertainment, I kicked into just like watching shows, haha, see the sharing, flirting and flaming among some people. it gave me a lot of fun. I just sat in the "cinema" quietly to see all things happened. Some people had quite good performances, I learned a lot from them, and some acted like clowns, brought me a lot of fun. Thank to every one of them.<br><br>But I feel sad that the forum are not as attractive as before, that may be why so many people left, and the people's leaving must be one of the reason this forum lost attractiveness. (at least for me). It sounds rude and offended to the new comers, but I have to say that really more and more new comers acted rude and stupid. This is a forum, everyone has the freedom of speech. Everyone can keep their own different opinions in many issues. Something are nice to your ears, just smile to accept it, if it is not good for you, why not let it in through your left ear and out through your right ear. What's the point for fight others with personal attack. Just like watching a show, if you think someone did not act well, do you have right to throw eggs to them? It is rude and degrades yourself. More and more people come just like a typhoon, come fast and go fast with plenty damages and leave without any considerations to others.<br><br>More and more people threw out hundreds posts without any meanings but craps or personal attacks to others. I know that myself did not contribute any intellectual or funny posts to you guys, I should not have any complains. But as a regular reader, can I give any comments? As usually, when I want to read a book to get some knowledge or fun, but finally get nothing at all, I used to sigh and say to the book, can you donÂ¡Â¦t make me so regretted to spend so much time on reading you.<br><br>Go back to the flaming thread, I still felt joyful to read it yesterday and treat it as a joke. After reading more and more disgusting postings, yeah, I feel damn disgusted.<br><br>My finally exams is coming on next week, I scolded myself again and again for coming on line to "chase' some threads in this forum. It is definitely a waste of time. Now, due to the disgusted feelings, nothing more " motivated" than this to stop me keeping reading and posting. I will come back to this forum when I finish the exams. hope no much shit or pollution at that time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>To the disappointed performers here, if you feel disappointed to the unwelcome readers, you can keep act yourself or choose to leave for somewhere suitable for you, although it maybe someone's loss.<br><br>Did I speak too much and offended  you? If I did, i apologis, forgive me please. Thanks for sharing my sentiments.<br><br>All the best<br><br>iamabird<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear iamabird, you've been here for so long? I've been here for about a week and I've started to get tired of it already. Yes, this place has a rich history and many friendships are made here. But along with frienships come bias. You attack one, one whole bunch closes in on you. It doesn't matter whether that person is right, people just say so what, they are proud to defend based on no other reason than because that person is a friend. If you don't want to be as bo liao as to flame continuosly until the thread hits 500, you are a loser. And people simply can't lose, they will come up with fake characters to praise themselves. After all, if you lose, you have to put up with people going around claiming proudly, "I've made a grown man/woman cry" and "I know I'm arrogant and insensitive but so what?" If that's the case, this forum has hit its peak and started to go downhill. Newcomers simply find it hard to fit in. Oh well, it happens in a number of forums. This will no doubt be taken as a personal affront by some people, but the truth is, they can't run away from their bad behaviour in the past because that's all recorded in the postings they have made. To these people, all I want to say is go ahead, flame me, and prove me right. I'm going to study for my exams like iamabird. It's really no big deal for me to "lose" anyway.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've insulted people, too, but you are right, the jc v.s. poly thing is sickening.  it's like gang fight, two people looking at each other at the same time and, thinking they are being stared at, stared back.  So the staring goes all the way to shoving and later to fight.<br><br>It's ugly but perhaps we are not meant for harmony because rights inevitably crashes.  Anyone has the right to have an opinion and it may differ from mine but I think I also have the right to tell him off if I think his opinion is offensive and misguided.  Then he has the right to defend himself and call me a self righteous bitch.  And I have the right to shove his foot inside his ear.  And so on and so forth.<br><br>You can always ignore the flaming threads, though.  The people involved seem strong and fit enough to fight their own cause.  If you find the topic actually interesting, you can always post a new one.<br><br>[This message has been edited by MayaJade (edited 29 April 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Judging from the month im registered in...u would say i started at the same time as iamabird. I agree wholeheartedly with iamabird that the forums seem to have lost a huge chunk of its attractiveness. I believe the decline started somewhere at the beginning of this month. Due to wat reasons? I believe its because we are seriously running out of topics and many of the old regulars have began to stop posting...<br>Iamabird, those old regulars have not left. They have merely just stopped posting thats all. They are all still around, firewire, dakar, ngkaihoe, braveheart, pacman etc etc...u can still find them in the irc channel #sgcafe The thing is...after a period of time...you get tired of posting...it gets hard to keep track of all the postings let alone keep posting. Some of the old regulars are also now busy with their work and thus they tend to post less often now.<br>As for the issue about the new members...there seems to be a huge wave of them coming in...so much so that i don't recognise any of them. Not all the topics they post are stupid to say the least so we can't blame them.<br>Back then when jcgirls or sggirls was still around, many pple. i believe were not that daring in their postings, they know where they stand and theres virtually no flaming at all except for a few cases. The posts at that time were much more interesting as well. Of course it could just be the fact that im also bored of reading the same topics again and again.<br>Bleue, since you know that there are friendships being made here...you would of course realise that all these pple. have know each other better than those who do not know them. Thus they feel the need to defend their friends as they know they are not what the others have written about them in the forum. Wouldn't you do the same if you see your friend getting flamed for something he/she isn't being described to be? Remember...we have to put ourselves in other pple's shoes...what may seem right to you doesn't mean its right to others. Pple. can and do misinterpret words and what other pple think. Flame you? Theres nothing to flame about you. You are stating your own opinions and i can't really say you are wrong after all... considering the state of affairs in this forum nowadays.<br>iamabird...you should join the rest for their outings you know...that way you can get to know the rest of the pple. better. Look at the no. of posts i have and u can see im not a regular poster. only 60+ posts in 6 months?? An average of 10 posts per month? hahaha...isn't that pathetic of me. Im glad to have known pple like Braveheart and Pacman even though i have not met them yet. It was these 2 to a certain extent that introduced me to the rest of the forumites...pple like my lex jiejie, maya jiejie, callan etc etc...Here i would like to thank the both of them.<br>These are merely my 2 cents worth of opinions. Do correct me if u feel im wrong in any aspect.<br><br>------------------<br>Cherish Yesterday<br>Dream Tomorrow<br>Live Today</div>
