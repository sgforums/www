Come to think of it, you would accept anything as fact so long as it suited your mood. Yes, Christianity's survived all this time, and the Crusades, witch hunts and other atrocities commited in the name of Christ were supported by people who did things without thinking, much in the manner that you're doing now. </strong><br><br>That prove that you cannot take the assumption that we need man to produce, noting hv been provern ya. And as you quoted, the Virgin Mary, what does virgin means to you. Am i asking a virgin man here flying on virgin airline?<br><br><strong>[quote by Ged]Crime? Your ineptitude is certainly criminal, but have I at any point suggested you were on trial for anything? You're the one who wants to rap the gavel and make a complete fool of yourself playing judge, so perhaps you should charge yourself with a mistrial[/quote</strong>].<br><br>I take your insultation and comments gracefully, but you cannot judge me as criminal as you are no judge to give the verdict nor hve the right.
