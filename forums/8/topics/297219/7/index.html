            <div class='col-md body'>Has anyone NOT watched those redneck americans in borat?<br><br>Perhaps, most of the "ang mohs", or may i use a better term caucasians, we meet in Singapore are mostly expatriates who are educated, wealthy with stable jobs. That, in essence, has distorted some Singaporeans' views that caucasians have more money and are smarter than the locals.<br><br>However, in fact, this is wrong. The caucasians in Singapore are, as I must qualify, of the above group I mentioned. To extrapolate the distorted data set we meet and interact with and applying it onto the general cauasian population is an insult to common sense. After all, there are poor caucasians in Western countries as well. On the flip side, not every caucasians are here just looking for cheap flings, uncouth or uncommitted as some people make them out to be.<br><br>Perhaps, a certain person whose alias contains an angel must keep in mind drawing comparisons between the caucasians you meet and the locals. After all, in Singapore, you tend to interact with the general local population while the caucasians are mostly from one side of the bell curve. It's a gross injustice to apply any hasty generalisations from that unreliable sample data size of yours.<br><br>In all fairness, this thread has seen some artillery of generalisations and stereotypes of different races and ethnics groups being hurled across both sides of the battlefield. It is better to keep in mind that such artillery are inherently dangerous and flawed. Every group has its own black sheeps as dictated by the Gaussian normal distribution, more commonly known as the bell curve. Having seen more black sheeps of a certain group than the other does not necessarily mean that the former group comprises of mostly black sheeps.<br><br>And lastly, to those opposed to a certain person whose alias contains an angel (sorry I refuse to say "a certain angel"), the more you try to refute her assertions, the deeper you are sinking into her trap. After all, she could just erect (no, not the other meaning) a defence that the refutations are nothing more than pathetic attempts of local guys trying to defend themselves and thus vindicating her gross generalisation of local guys.<br><br>P.S.
