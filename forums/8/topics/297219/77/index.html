With the scoreline of 6-2, 6-3, 6-2 favouring Tsonga, it must be a very big mouthful of his own medicine for Nadal to swallow!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>For me all the am male/female players are nice to watch them playing but for some unknown reasons, Nadal (although I think he is a nice am) somehow or other grates on my nerves with his mannerism of fidgetting here &amp; there, pumping his fist <strong>angrily</strong> into the air after he had scored a big point &amp; almost alway stugging at his butt before he makes his serve.
