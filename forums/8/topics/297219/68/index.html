Let say PSA hv an EBIT of 500 millions export profit in this region supporting the max 5 millions peoples here. Per Capital will be 500.<br><br>Therefore, the shanghai port is busy because of it own domestic market serving a huge population, but PSA is busy doing international trading with the good quality, fast and efficient services. In comparison, Shanghai tonage increased because of the needs to supply and serves it own population, and i agreed that import can be at time more than export as china needs resources, that will be a deficit. Why BERI (a business economy indicator) praised PSA to be the most efficient and effective is because it is not a port that serve it own citizens, it serves the world with a premium service that command a premium price, and even with premium prices, ships are calling at PSA because they know, with a full loaded container cargos, the download and upload is promised within 24 hrs and the next vessel pilot in, 1-2 days less than other well known conventional ports. And in some third world ports, if it can finish within a week, you are happy liao. And if it is cold cargo that need to be export, and some jokers down in some ports goes on strike or port diseaster such as tyhoon, wars, electrical breakdown, incompetence staffs, corrupted officers, no petrol for lorries to carry the containers as it had happened in china...god bless u, your cold cherries or grapes or lobster or abalones or oysters is going to melt and the cargo is going to stall, and if u do not hv a strong financial insurance that withold its guidelines, then you compensation is going to be peanuts, not to mention losing of customers.</div></blockquote>And once again we veer off topic.<br><br>Speaking of Peanuts - I heard that peanuts are 600k per piece in Singapore a while back. Very expensive peanuts. So if a minister get 2 million per year, that is about 3 or so parts peanuts. When you pay peanuts , you get monkeys.<br><br>Singapore is geographically well located . There is no denying that fact. Yes Singaporean ports are well runned but I won't be putting other ports down if I were you. Once upon a time , SIA was well runned and no. 1 . Now it is famous for dropping a bolt on a sydney home and it is not even number 1 anymore. So don't run down other countries - they may well be able to compete soon enough on equal terms.<br><br>Like I said before ,  the conversation was with richong who equated busiest to being the best.

There is no denying that fact. Yes Singaporean ports are well runned but I won't be putting other ports down if I were you. Once upon a time , SIA was well runned and no. 1 .

Oh no, we are not the most expensive, no doubt we are more highly paid, but we deliver. And No doubt some Ministers in other countries are taking less paid, but their under table payment should be able to overide our paid here.<br><br>And if were to compare the per sq inch of city land in singapore and the business arena of Pudong in Shanghai, u will be surprise they cost much much higher than here, we are not expensive, just that we get higher share with a niche in cost of labour, transparency and good economy of scale.<br><br>I am not saying SIA or PSA are nos 1, but merely stating out that with regard to the efficiency and effectiveness in term of labour utilisation, the structural framework, financial transparency and the adaptativity to changes as a nation in this business, we alway have a competitative edges over others, that make us a main contender for any challengers.<br><br></div>

In Jewish tradition, any child born of a Jewish mother is considered a Jew; in Reform Judaism a child is considered a Jew if either parent is Jewish.<br><br>Another important medieval theme was the accusation that Jews kidnapped Christian children and crucified them on Good Friday or Easter Sunday; two child saints, William of Norwich and Hugh of Lincoln, are alleged to have been Â‘martyredÂ’ in this way, and to have miraculously revealed the whereabouts of their corpses by singing prayers after death. Hugh's story was told in ballads, and also by Chaucer as Â‘The Prioress's TaleÂ’.<br><br><strong>Jewish religion was assumed to consist of sorcery and devil-worship, leading Christians to apply the terms Â‘synagogueÂ’ and Â‘sabbathÂ’ to gatherings of witches. Yet, paradoxically, Hebrew was seen as the most sacred of all languages, outranking even Latin and Greek; hence the widespread use of Hebrew words, letters, and symbols in ritual magic, and in healing charms</strong>"<br><br>UnQuote.<br><br>Aunt, u go ask that Jew's Uncle you are seeing, is it true or not.
