So beware ya, ang mo are skill in using indirect smoothing sentences or words that you dun even know you are insulted and yet say thank you to them.<br><br>My tolerance refer to the willingness to strive in term of working, we are working peoples, we can work long hours, we can forgo certain benefits, we can ride the wave with bosses when time are bad, and cut cost for the benefit of all. Ang mo do have that tolerance because they are more individualistic and hold on to their unionism rights without any negotiatable option.
