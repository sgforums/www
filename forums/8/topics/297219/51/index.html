Yup, that fits right in with your little porn fantasies.  YouÂ’re right that youÂ’re two of a kind Â– both making up stories. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>IÂ’d like to reciprocate the advice to change your life and control your destiny, but you seem too hopelessly lost with your hand in your pants and your head in Neverland. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Thanks for that thought, though, but IÂ’m doing more than well enough in the real world. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

On the other hand, sheÂ’s not even interacting with said foreigners Â– sheÂ’s just making up stories and thatÂ’s one of the key reasons why weÂ’re taking the mickey out of her (or as jon phrases it, Â“messing with herÂ”).  ItÂ’s not a case of being sensitive, itÂ’s a case of us having a good laugh at a bare-faced liar whoÂ’s too stupid to even realise how outlandish her claims are.<br><br>YouÂ’re probably too thick to see it, or maybe just too blinded by that red haze, but these points are not valid, and weÂ’re under no obligation to accept lies. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by jojobeach:</div><div class="quote_body">And you like what Gedanken is doing ?

She shoots her mouth off, tells everybody to bring it on and then acts like a crybaby when she gets the thumping sheÂ’s been begging for?  Well, tough bickies Â– if sheÂ’s big enough to instigate a flame war, sheÂ’d jolly well better come prepared to get as well as she gives, plain and simple.  Mind you, sheÂ’s too dumb to understand half the jokes weÂ’ve been making about her, so neither she nor you have all that much to bleat about. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by jojobeach:</div><div class="quote_body">Lemme guess, you're gonna make your wife get a hysterectomy ?<br>Good choice bro.</div></blockquote>And why would I do that?
