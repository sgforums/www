Which part of what I wrote in any way, shape of form lines up with the following quote from you on page 3?<br><br><blockquote>Exactly, me also like ang mo guy, they are more romantic and dun whine like singaporean mommy boys, they are also very sociable and approachable, very humble and have a good sense of humor. Our sg boys are like stone, sissy and also...er...eh...small..</blockquote>Now you're a liar and a hypocrite too, and the proof's right here in this thread. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Since you're obviously too thick to get it, I'll spell it out for you.  You're one of the ones with stars in your eyes, as the quote above so clearly demonstrates.<br><br>If you want it any simpler than that I'll have to draw it in crayon for you.</div>

Sissy one, must be.<br><br>The problem with self proclaim intellect is they like to shine on the mirror and do strange talking to it, yo man, i aint psycho to do that, and when i do my reflection on a mirror, oh i wonder who is that beautiful gal in me. Keep cool ya, talking too much by yourself over a mirror is going to make ur brain hallucinated. Face the real world face on ok.<br><br>And my brain is right where it is in enclose with a well shaped skull, at the right place and on the right side, now if u wish to take a knife and operate on yourself, you go ahead, but make sure get it right, cos in the law of reflection, everything right is left, and everything correct is wrong, get it.<br></div></blockquote>OMG why do you keep insisting that we meet? Isn't it enough if we trash out our differences (never mind about reconciliation because that is highly improbable in the first place) online? Friends? Maybe. Lovers? No. End up in hospital or mortuary? Please make sure that you can escape the police in the first place.<br><br>My little miss (with much emphasis on little) angel7030, alcoholic beverages can be found anywhere. Also, let me add another principle to your sparsely filled brain: Even though you can do something, it does not mean that you should do it. Similarly, even though I can buy alcohol doesn't mean I should. The difference between us and animals is our own ability to differentiate, choose and make decisions. In any case, I would really prefer coffee, hot chocolate or milk to go with toasting (hot chocolate's my favourite though). My friends respect that and I see no reason why you shouldn't. Well, even Jay Chou in his new album says that he prefers milk to alcohol (ok granted he's not a role model but it shows that some people do possess the ability and discipline to choose not to touch alcohol).<br><br>And sorry to disappoint you, not everyone loves to admire themselves in the mirror (unlike you) and I certainly do not talk to mirrors. After all, I have real friends to talk to. With regards to your self-proclaimed beauty, please do provide substantial evidence (as usual NPNT). Also, external beauty does not necessarily mean the existence of internal beauty and intelligence (although some people possess all three). As for hallucinations, make sure you didn't pop another of the LSD before writing that post.<br><br>When I say beware of your brain being crushed by a knife's edge, you didn't seem to understand what it meant. Perhaps let me phrase it another way, your brain makes a knife's edge look like an eight lane highway. In any case, please do not waste any money on surgery when there's nothing significant to operate on in the first place.<br><br>Lastly, you should know better than to talk about the law of reflection. Maybe eagle would like to confirm this. I believe the law of reflection you are talking about is more correctly known as the Law of Symmetry. In physics, the Law of Symmetry is not about "everything right is left, and everything correct is wrong" but about something quite different. Even then, the Law of Symmetry has been proven to be wrong in certain cases.</div>
