Although my first post was written in a register inappropriate for an online forum, I did not attempt to distort what I was trying to say. On the contrary, in summary, all I wrote in my first post was to say that any reply to your assertions by other forumites will be ultimately futile. Please reread what I wrote and tell me if I twisted what I said?<br><br>To add on, that's a difference between being forthright about oneself and always thinking that one is always correct. If the two were equivalent, how can one be forthright about being incorrect in a certain issue?<br><br>You: Simple, yes. Direct, yes.
