What are they made out to be so capable of? No one has answered that yet.<br><br>I shall infer from your post that you would define that false notion as 'white people are better than Singaporeans'. Now I'll address your points:<br><br>2. Many white people can speak and write in both English and French/Dutch/German/Italian/Spanish/Portuguese/Swedish/Finnish/Norwegian/Danish/<br>Polish/Hungarian/Czech/Estonian/Latvian/Lithuanian/Russian/Welsh/Greek/etc, and some can communicate in Mandarin.<br><br>3. Sure, we can be proud of some of the things we have achieved, but we aren't among the top in lots of other things also. Other countries have things to offer too us too (space, proximity to nature and outdoor activities, an environment conducive to creativity, etc), which migrants might value more than what you've mentioned, in the same way that some white visitors adore life here.<br><br>4. Many of the white people who come here are friendly, well-travelled and open-minded. I rarely have problems striking up conversations with them. Of course that doesn't always apply to those who haven't been out of their countries other than in cyberspace - but such people still exist in that mix.</div></blockquote>Dear sir<br><br><strong>"What are they made out to be capable of?

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't believe it works that way. Go to the CBD on a weekday and you'll also see lots of Asians dressed in office attire and suits. Our politicians don't dress shabbily when they're on TV either. These images appear at least as often as those of local hawkers and janitors.<br><br>The only scenario where that impression might apply is in the retail and F&amp;B scene - few white visitors come here to take up lowly jobs, so staff may subconsciously assume that they have more spending power, just as they make similar assumptions based on dress and appearances.<br><br>Colonial hangovers? We aren't bound by any feelings of fear or respect arising from history, are we? I think it's a poor explanation that has been cited too often for what it's worth, unless you can enlighten me how it works some other way.<br><br>As for the prolification of the English language as one of the reasons, I'll give it a little credit since the BBC, CNN and so on are often cited as good networks to learn to speak English from. It's a narrow-minded view though - what then becomes of white people with other accents and even Cockneys, Scots, Geordies, and the Irish?<br><br>Perhaps we are more receptive to white people because they represent something different from what we are used to, whether it's in the way they speak, their greetings or their outlook. It works that way for the mind that isn't negatively prejudiced, no matter the prejudiced. The chances that they are visitors are also high and so we'd like to leave a good impression on them.<br><br>So once again, what exactly is the hype that haven't they been living up to?</div>
