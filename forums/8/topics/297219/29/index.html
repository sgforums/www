I used to think white guys are scum due to singaporean socialising . Used to hate them like crazy , yeah they take jobs from singaporeans , yeah they take girls/guys from singaporeans etc. I have a newer perspective now .<br><br>I have been staying in Australia for quite a while . I work in a majority caucasian organisation. In Singapore , I don't get calls from colleagues who are concerned about me when I get admitted to hospital or sick . In Australia , my caucasian colleagues come and visit me in hospital , express their concern etc ,or give me a call to check how I am going. Once , one of the caucasian neurosurgeons actually shifted me into his busy schedule a few months ahead of his appointment load because my fellow nursing colleagues ( the white and singaporean ones) actually asked him for that favor to see me since I was a former nursing staff in the neurosurgical ward. He is a nice guy who didn't wave me off on my concerns with my cervical and lumbar prolapsed discs. Sometimes I see him around and he asks how I am . In Singapore , I don't really think that will happen unless you are actually a personal friend of a doctor or some powerful AND rich fella.<br><br>I turn off one nice caucasian guy who liked me alot because of my parents' say so and my misguided notions especially when I thought of the SPG stereotype. I literally told him off stating that all white guys seem to think we asian girls are cheap etc . He told me not to use racial overtones on him and not all white guys are after sex - yes some can be horny as hell . They are basically as human as everyone else - they want friends too - people who they can discuss their interests, problems, ambitions and hopes etc. They are physically more open because of how they were brought up . A hug and a kiss can be their normal greeting of saying hello . None of the caucasian guys dare to hug or kiss me because they know asian culture can be conservative regarding opposite gender contact . The girls , however , would hug me when they see me.<br><br>Now I have an american caucasian friend who I have a teenagelike crush on . He is cute and refreshing in many ways . So what ? Does that make me an spg ? He doesn't care how I dress - and I mean HOW I DRESS - I am tshirt and jeans type of person on my offdays . I read how one girl says she has to dress skimpy to attract caucasian guys . Well THAT IS TRULY SAD . I don't need to dress skimpy to talk to one , let alone act like I don't mind their type of greeting. He knows that I don't like to be hugged and kissed like the other caucasians and he respects that. He can be playful and smack me on my arm for fun but he doesn't even bother about my appearance . He will tell waitresses to back off in a sarcastic tone if they try to pick him up when I am around him . Mind you even though I said Hey it is ok. Our relationship is strictly platonic .<br><br>Most asian guys I go out with wants me to dress up so that I can look nice to their friends ...really what kind of shat is that . My caucasian friends don't even care whether I put make up or not . If I look nice , they will complement me on it . If I look like crap , there is always a cafe we can relax and chit chat about everything under the sun.<br><br>I find that some singaporean guys have so much insecurities that they have to go picking on white people . Oooh they take away our girls because they have bigger d**ks ...oooh they take away our jobs . Not their fault it is happening - some of you project a large amount of insecurity which turns people off whether guys or girls. AS FOR THOSE GIRLS WHO THINK THAT THEY HAVE TO DRESS LIKE HOOKERS TO GET CAUCASIAN GUYS - YOU SERIOUSLY will look like a !%#@# to them and WILL get treated like one . Hey what u see is what u get , right? Please dress more respectably is all I advise . You get more respect that way.<br><br>Get over it ...move on. If you cannot get a good job in singapore , look elsewhere instead of moaning about your low paying jobs or thereof lack of career advancement . That is what australians/americans/europeans do mostly , they get bored in their countries , they apply for overseas jobs which open up another area of the world for them to explore . Not to mention they will have a new area of expertise to compete with you back home. Can you actually believe my singaporean working experience came in useful in australia? It open some new avenues for me when I thought it was useless but my caucasian friend said use it and I did . Make urself mobile , don't tie urself down .<br><br>Most of all quit moaning about caucasians or people dating them . It's a globalized world . Think of what can you make your future out of urself rather than blame someone else for your inadequacies . It doesn't project well on Singaporeans when someone does the anti caucasian thing.<br><br>PS the ones I find always complaining about the quintessential ang moh are actually the ones I find always kissing the ang mo arses . Come on . If they did wrong , tell it to their face. I do that and I do have some problems with my colleagues regarding that but hell , they know I am very blunt and straightforward which they respect . How the hell would I even be a senior staff then?</div></blockquote>This is one huge cruel but true post.<br><br>But putting in perspective, let's face it, all the mud-slinging here are actually not about the above-mentioned issue. Rather, it is just about how one poster cannot even take a tiny semblance of criticism.<br><br>Sadly, the more we smash her, the more she will use it as her defence on how sg boys overreact etc.</div>

Hey, it's kinda natural.<br><br>In my defence, I would only like to show the first few posts between angel7030 and me.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by teraexa:</div><div class="quote_body">Has anyone NOT watched those redneck americans in borat?<br><br>Perhaps, most of the "ang mohs", or may i use a better term caucasians, we meet in Singapore are mostly expatriates who are educated, wealthy with stable jobs. That, in essence, has distorted some Singaporeans' views that caucasians have more money and are smarter than the locals.<br><br>However, in fact, this is wrong. The caucasians in Singapore are, as I must qualify, of the above group I mentioned. To extrapolate the distorted data set we meet and interact with and applying it onto the general cauasian population is an insult to common sense. After all, there are poor caucasians in Western countries as well. On the flip side, not every caucasians are here just looking for cheap flings, uncouth or uncommitted as some people make them out to be.<br><br>Perhaps, a certain person whose alias contains an angel must keep in mind drawing comparisons between the caucasians you meet and the locals. After all, in Singapore, you tend to interact with the general local population while the caucasians are mostly from one side of the bell curve. It's a gross injustice to apply any hasty generalisations from that unreliable sample data size of yours.<br><br>In all fairness, this thread has seen some artillery of generalisations and stereotypes of different races and ethnics groups being hurled across both sides of the battlefield. It is better to keep in mind that such artillery are inherently dangerous and flawed. Every group has its own black sheeps as dictated by the Gaussian normal distribution, more commonly known as the bell curve. Having seen more black sheeps of a certain group than the other does not necessarily mean that the former group comprises of mostly black sheeps.<br><br>And lastly, to those opposed to a certain person whose alias contains an angel (sorry I refuse to say "a certain angel"), the more you try to refute her assertions, the deeper you are sinking into her trap. After all, she could just erect (no, not the other meaning) a defence that the refutations are nothing more than pathetic attempts of local guys trying to defend themselves and thus vindicating her gross generalisation of local guys.<br><br>P.S.

Those of us who have dated Singaporeans and people from other cultures and countries will know well enough not to be so dumb as to go, "This one is so good, this one is so bad".
