All I said was not to generalise the entire population based on a few samples. Please do elaborate on how is that a narrowed mind. I would really like to know.<br><br>Go out, meet and trash it out? Ah, that's a classic catch-22 trap you are setting there for me. If I refuse, you will just say that I do not have the guts to stand up for my views in real life and face others with it. If I accept, who knows what damage might be done to my identity. After all, for every online persona here exists a corresponding actual persona in reality. I am definitely not going to risk any damage to my actual persona by you. Meeting up sure smacks of a suspicious way to smear my name eh (c.f.

After all, in countering your arguments, I reread your posts numerous times to formulate my counter-arguments. Any rational person who's truly interested in a debate would not mind rereading what the opponent said. In fact, rereading helps you to spot any loopholes purported by the opponent and avoid any misinterpretations.<br><br>Regarding your 4th paragraph, let me requote what you first post was:<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by angel7030:</div><div class="quote_body">Exactly, me also like ang mo guy, they are more romantic and dun whine like singaporean mommy boys, they are also very sociable and approachable, very humble and have a good sense of humor. Our sg boys are like stone, sissy and also...er...eh...small..</div></blockquote>Now, show this paragraph to any person and ask them to interpret what you are trying to say. Chances are, they will tend to think that you are generalising. Then again, you said, "But you never asked me whether I was generalising what..." Wow! Classic "You never ask me what I never said therefore I can't be judged on what I said" trick. You are judged based on what you said and what can be inferred from what you said. You cannot expect people to read your mind based on that paragraph alone. In any case, how can I be sure that you weren't generalising the population in your mind when you wrote that? Ambiguity is as solid as smoke. If I said, "I am going to kill Mr X." Surely you will infer 1) I will kill Mr X or 2) I am just talking nonsense. What if you decided that 1 was true and you called the police. Can I say, "But you never asked me if I was going to kill Mr X. After all, I intend to kill him on his deathbed 60 years later."?<br><br>I am too bossy? Thanks for that evaluation and I will keep it in mind in my future actions. I am ungentlemanly? Speaking out on what's wrong does not mean that's ungentlemanly. After all, gentlemanliness is only for those deserving. Unfortunately, you are neither correct nor deserving.</div>
