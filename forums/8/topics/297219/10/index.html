Where do i hangout and who i hangout with, play a critical role in determining the state of sg men.<br><br>In my opinon, sg men really need to improve in their images, dress up, manners and of cos, gentlemenship.<br><br>eg, at clarke quay pub, a sg guy with worn sport shoes and spiked hair full of low grade gel smell, jean and a t shirt seem like from $2 shop, approached me to hv a drink with me, I mean it not that he is not old or not nice looking, but look at the way he present himself is totally out of the context for the nite which i, in my capacity, with fashioned tank top covered with black silk, sexy skirt, high heels and lancome make up couldn't really take up his offer. And the way of approach was, so stoned " Hi, i am sam and you are?" What the hell is he thinking??? and if you look at others (angmo), they dress to the nite as appriopriate as it is, approach very well and speak with good sense of understanding, " Oh mine!, that is a nice skirt you have there, lady, let me a chance to offer you a drink" and then on he makes you feel comfortable to be with and we can talk and drink the nite away ya. And they dun mind other guys or gals to join in too, whereas i feels sg boys/men are more narrow in a way they feel frustrated and irritated when someone join in, just like every guys talk to me is their enemy.<br><br>So hope u see my point</div>
