I said she <span style="text-decoration: underline;">doesn't</span> nag, not that she won't become naggy.<br><br>In any case, I figured you were going in that direction with your questioning, and it's not a left-field issue.  Do women change as they age?  Yes, they do.  On the other hand, personality tends to remain stable throughout life (barring significant changes in physiological condition), so I've already got a good idea of what the missus is already made of.<br><br>One important correlate of nagging is the amount of empowerment that each party feels within the group (the group being the married couple in this case).  There's an inverse relationship between the two, and we make a point to ensure that making decisions and carrying out tasks is done in an equitable manner.</div>

Just wondering, if females desire gender equality, how come gentlemanly behaviour is still coveted by many? After all, gentlemanly behaviour is based on the premise that females require more protection than males and therefore merit special actions. This, in itself, is a form of gender bias.</div></blockquote>I'm not taking her sides. But she does have SOME valid points.<br></div>
