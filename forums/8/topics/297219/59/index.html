Hey hey money works both way - if rich men can get pretty young things, why not a rich woman getting her handsome young boys?<br><br>Oh wait.....have fun taking money while you still have the looks. When your looks disappear as you age , start worrying about your sugar daddy looking elsewhere hunnie.</div></blockquote>Yo Aunt, i should say, gals never asked any men for money, it just that men had these bad habits, they like to share their money with gals, they had a funny habit of buying expensive diamonds and gold stuffs for gals, and also they are very fond of crediting money into gal's account rather than their wifeys and mothers. If u are going to give money to boys, drop the bad habit ya, if not i am going to tell granny and hope she spanks your backside for being a bad aunt.<br><br>And in whatever ways money works for the rich, it buy no love, no can do. Be enlighted.<br><br>And as we aged, so are the sugar daddies, with the money and agreements in bag, who care what the old, lamed lollipop man is looking for.</div>
