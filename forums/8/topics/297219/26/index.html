The only thing demonstrated by angel's going off-track is that she knows she's wrong but is trying to weasel her way out of the corner she's painted herself into by chucking red herrings by the bucketload in all directions.  Some of the sharks have simply gone right past her efforts to distract people from the real issues.<br><br>As a test, just try reading through the thread again and see how many of the issues raised by other members have actually been addressed by her.  She simply chucks in another offensive post in the hope that people will forget the questions she's been asked and cannot answer.<br><br>Between angel and Marco_Simone, we've got both ends of the spectrum - both put "ang mos" up on a pedestal, but one chooses to react by being a lout while the other kisses ass.</div>
