            <div class='col-md body'>Hope you had a good lunch. I've got a few points of my own:<br><br>1. I've lost count of the number of pages that have passed since I asked someone to define how white people are overrated. What are they made out to be so capable of? No one has answered that yet.<br><br>I shall infer from your post that you would define that false notion as 'white people are better than Singaporeans'. Now I'll address your points:<br><br>2. Many white people can speak and write in both English and French/Dutch/German/Italian/Spanish/Portuguese/Swedish/Finnish/Norwegian/Danish/<br>Polish/Hungarian/Czech/Estonian/Latvian/Lithuanian/Russian/Welsh/Greek/etc, and some can communicate in Mandarin.<br><br>3. Sure, we can be proud of some of the things we have achieved, but we aren't among the top in lots of other things also. Other countries have things to offer too us too (space, proximity to nature and outdoor activities, an environment conducive to creativity, etc), which migrants might value more than what you've mentioned, in the same way that some white visitors adore life here.<br><br>4. Many of the white people who come here are friendly, well-travelled and open-minded. I rarely have problems striking up conversations with them. Of course that doesn't always apply to those who haven't been out of their countries other than in cyberspace - but such people still exist in that mix.<blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by richong 3216:</div><div class="quote_body">Sure it's about ang mos are overrated &amp; to me am r am nothing more nothing less.

If u read my post carefully what I said was "to me am r am nothing more, nothing less" which to me is visible, specific &amp; measurable &amp; not a generalization as u have commented.  You said u know of a few am who r multi lingual but in sg almost all of us r at least bi-lingual.<br><br>Pt 2. What is the reason behind the so called conformity as stated by u?  I think the main reason the conformity is that everything is going &amp; working well for sg &amp; many r satisfied with the status quo otherwise why should the people keep on voting in the present govt term after term?.<br><br>Regarding the airport &amp; seaport standings I said that "for being 1st (if not 2nd)" &amp; not saying that sg is always 1st in the world.  You said sg is not the best seaport but the busiest sea port - dont u think busiest is something as good as the best?.<br><br>Sorry have to go for 'happy hour ' with my buddies - already late half hr.<br><br>Will catch up with u after I am back this evening.  Happy posting to all.</div>
