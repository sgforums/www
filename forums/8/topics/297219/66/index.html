Go to the CBD on a weekday and you'll also see lots of Asians dressed in office attire and suits. Our politicians don't dress shabbily when they're on TV either. These images appear at least as often as those of local hawkers and janitors.<br><br>The only scenario where that impression might apply is in the retail and F&amp;B scene - few white visitors come here to take up lowly jobs, so staff may subconsciously assume that they have more spending power, just as they make similar assumptions based on dress and appearances.<br><br>Colonial hangovers? We aren't bound by any feelings of fear or respect arising from history, are we? I think it's a poor explanation that has been cited too often for what it's worth, unless you can enlighten me how it works some other way.<br><br>As for the prolification of the English language as one of the reasons, I'll give it a little credit since the BBC, CNN and so on are often cited as good networks to learn to speak English from. It's a narrow-minded view though - what then becomes of white people with other accents and even Cockneys, Scots, Geordies, and the Irish?<br><br>Just came in &amp; saw the ladies slugging it out under slightly different circunstances - was late today because I have to walk my 2 dogs, take my breakfast, walk 3 kilometres &amp; finally back after buying some 4 digits lottery.<br><br>Para 1 &amp; 2.  What I said of the rating of the am was "slight to moderate overrating" at this point in time.  From your description of the unfolding developements going on presently, I believe it's a matter of time before sg will treat &amp; interact with the am in the way they do with any others.<br><br>Para 3.  During my time please be reminded that everything we learnt in school (except the science subjects) was am orientated - history , literature &amp; even the examination papers were sent to University of Cambridge to be marked &amp; graded accordingly.  How can we not be psychologically influenced by this kind of situation?<br><br>Nice talking with u - at least once in a while someone musts come back to the subject as we enjoy the side show  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Perhaps we are more receptive to white people because they represent something different from what we are used to, whether it's in the way they speak, their greetings or their outlook. It works that way for the mind that isn't negatively prejudiced, no matter the prejudiced. The chances that they are visitors are also high and so we'd like to leave a good impression on them.<br><br>So once again, what exactly is the hype that haven't they been living up to?</div></blockquote></div>

Singapore already lost alot of first places - let's see  - SIA not first anymore, Changi not first anymore.  Actually I would place the blame on million dollar ministers who cannot think ahead like CEOs.<br><br>I am not as dense as you to migrate because of the reason you have given. Where there is a dream to fulfil and money to be made , who gives a crap about whether it is China or Australia or even India.<br><br>Of course, some of us are not as lucky as u are to depend on family owned business with containers .

So, a country with a big population, huge land, big talks, big project, big factory of the world, there bound to have be heavier load. But a good terminal is not base on heavy load, it base on efficient, effectiveness and the infrastructure that support it. In logistic concern, we stand as nos 1. If u send a cargo down to Europe with a stipulated date, it will arrive as stated with insurance coverage and just in/on time delivery. But if you are to send in Shanghai or some china port, there tends to have papers problems, delay of shipment, cargo lost, stormy weather, container jammed on the road or no one is working today when call upon kind of situation. U got it.<br><br>PSA is not only serving singapore small market, it is a transition/trading port for most countries around the regionwhereas shanghai serve CHINA, a quarter of world population lives there. Import and waiting increased it tonnages. PSA is doing export, and it is the unit of export that determine our GDP growth. So, aunt, big dosn't mean good ya, but ang mo different ok.<br><br></div>
