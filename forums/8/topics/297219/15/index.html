            <div class='col-md body'>To expand, LSD is lysergic acid diethylamide, commonly called "acid" on the street (if you come across the phrase "drop acid" it means ingesting LSD).  Back in the 60's it was pushed as a recreational drug by the hippie community and of course went up in value once it was banned.  LSD is a hallucinogen, affecting perception and emotions, and largely explains Angel's delusions of adequacy.</div>
