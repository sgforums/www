(anyway she got nothing to do except watching korea dramas and shares market)<br><br>But on the contrary, i understand these guys, most probably with their small sizes, they feft frustrated about their sizes when i stated the fact that ang mo is big. I really do pity them, but of course there are big size Asian men too, (as what uncle Andrew said there are good and bad) and i believe for those big size asian men, they dun even bother me because they knew they are ok.<br><br>Nevertheless, i never overate ang mo, it just some small sized men here are doing some kind of self inflicted personal disorder mentality that simply cannot change their sizes.<br><br>Within the discussion, i even make an effort to get those misunderstand issue clear by making appointment with a small size man, and another one who even brought his wife into the picture, and i offer to meet up with her too, but then, i understand small size may hv small and narrow heart, giving excuses by downgrading me, well it ok, too bad. And so i brought my grandma along as i need some support from her experiences, I thot of bringing Grandpa (ah kong) but he is so attached to his properties, stock and shares market as bosses do.<br><br></div>
