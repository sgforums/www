Most ang mohs dont really give a damn to unfortunate ppl.. only few will.. but most will even curse them. Why do you think that even the beggars do many kind of stuffs or stunt to impress the ppl ? cuz nobody gonna give a shyt to beggars without anything. They wont give a penny to beggar that dont impress them at all.</div>
