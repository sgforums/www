So, a country with a big population, huge land, big talks, big project, big factory of the world, there bound to have be heavier load. But a good terminal is not base on heavy load, it base on efficient, effectiveness and the infrastructure that support it. In logistic concern, we stand as nos 1. If u send a cargo down to Europe with a stipulated date, it will arrive as stated with insurance coverage and just in/on time delivery. But if you are to send in Shanghai or some china port, there tends to have papers problems, delay of shipment, cargo lost, stormy weather, container jammed on the road or no one is working today when call upon kind of situation. U got it.<br><br>PSA is not only serving singapore small market, it is a transition/trading port for most countries around the regionwhereas shanghai serve CHINA, a quarter of world population lives there. Import and waiting increased it tonnages. PSA is doing export, and it is the unit of export that determine our GDP growth. So, aunt, big dosn't mean good ya, but ang mo different ok.<br><br></div></blockquote>Xiao mei mei - that was to richong who formulated the equation of busiest = best.

No one will call you dumb if you don't say anything.<br><br>I wouldn't reduce China to a country with inefficient shipping ports China has her good points and bad.

Let say PSA hv an EBIT of 500 millions export profit in this region supporting the max 5 millions peoples here.

In comparison, Shanghai tonage increased because of the needs to supply and serves it own population, and i agreed that import can be at time more than export as china needs resources, that will be a deficit. Why BERI (a business economy indicator) praised PSA to be the most efficient and effective is because it is not a port that serve it own citizens, it serves the world with a premium service that command a premium price, and even with premium prices, ships are calling at PSA because they know, with a full loaded container cargos, the download and upload is promised within 24 hrs and the next vessel pilot in, 1-2 days less than other well known conventional ports. And in some third world ports, if it can finish within a week, you are happy liao. And if it is cold cargo that need to be export, and some jokers down in some ports goes on strike or port diseaster such as tyhoon, wars, electrical breakdown, incompetence staffs, corrupted officers, no petrol for lorries to carry the containers as it had happened in china...god bless u, your cold cherries or grapes or lobster or abalones or oysters is going to melt and the cargo is going to stall, and if u do not hv a strong financial insurance that withold its guidelines, then you compensation is going to be peanuts, not to mention losing of customers.</div>

Per Capital will be 500.<br><br>Therefore, the shanghai port is busy because of it own domestic market serving a huge population, but PSA is busy doing international trading with the good quality, fast and efficient services. In comparison, Shanghai tonage increased because of the needs to supply and serves it own population, and i agreed that import can be at time more than export as china needs resources, that will be a deficit. Why BERI (a business economy indicator) praised PSA to be the most efficient and effective is because it is not a port that serve it own citizens, it serves the world with a premium service that command a premium price, and even with premium prices, ships are calling at PSA because they know, with a full loaded container cargos, the download and upload is promised within 24 hrs and the next vessel pilot in, 1-2 days less than other well known conventional ports. And in some third world ports, if it can finish within a week, you are happy liao. And if it is cold cargo that need to be export, and some jokers down in some ports goes on strike or port diseaster such as tyhoon, wars, electrical breakdown, incompetence staffs, corrupted officers, no petrol for lorries to carry the containers as it had happened in china...god bless u, your cold cherries or grapes or lobster or abalones or oysters is going to melt and the cargo is going to stall, and if u do not hv a strong financial insurance that withold its guidelines, then you compensation is going to be peanuts, not to mention losing of customers.</div></blockquote>Fwwaaahhh..
