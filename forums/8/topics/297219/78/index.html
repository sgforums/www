I am also tall, but she is much taller, these russian beau are just fantastic, her real person with her hair down and natural look (very less make up) is so much beautiful than on court, when she had to sweat it out. During her appearance in Singapore, there was a group of japanese who idolise her wherever she goes, i think Japanese love her and she have a big fan base there.
