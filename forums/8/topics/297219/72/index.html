It works in the opposite way to what you've said, albeit in a different area - they can be downright scathing if they think an idea or product is rubbish.

I got it from my history books, it from Britannca Encyclopedia.<br><br>Quote "Jew<br><br>Any person whose religion is Judaism. In a wider sense the term refers to any member of a worldwide ethnic and cultural group descended from the ancient Hebrews who traditionally practiced the Jewish religion. The Hebrew term Yehudi, translated as Judaeus in Latin and Jew in English, originally referred to a member of the tribe of Judah. In Jewish tradition, any child born of a Jewish mother is considered a Jew; in Reform Judaism a child is considered a Jew if either parent is Jewish.<br><br>Another important medieval theme was the accusation that Jews kidnapped Christian children and crucified them on Good Friday or Easter Sunday; two child saints, William of Norwich and Hugh of Lincoln, are alleged to have been ÃâmartyredÃâ in this way, and to have miraculously revealed the whereabouts of their corpses by singing prayers after death. Hugh's story was told in ballads, and also by Chaucer as ÃâThe Prioress's TaleÃâ.<br><br>[b]Jewish religion was assumed to consist of sorcery and devil-worship, leading Christians to apply the terms ÃâsynagogueÃâ and ÃâsabbathÃâ to gatherings of witches. Yet, paradoxically, Hebrew was seen as the most sacred of all languages, outranking even Latin and Greek; hence the widespread use of Hebrew words, letters, and symbols in ritual magic, and in healing charms</strong>"<br><br>UnQuote.<br><br>Aunt, u go ask that Jew's Uncle you are seeing, is it true or not. Because that Israel guy i am seeing at my nearby vege restaurant is a buddhist, a dun give a damn about jews and arabs nor any other religions. I am talking about history not religion ok. I dun like religions, it create wars and divsion between peoples, never promise happiness.<br>[/b]</blockquote>You took it out of context with your earlier statement and implied something else . And now you are claiming otherwise? Not very smart are you?<br><br>Go pretend that you are actually seeing an israeli. I like your fantasy story of seeing one italian and one israeli guy.
