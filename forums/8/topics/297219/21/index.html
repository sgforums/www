Just wondering, if females desire gender equality, how come gentlemanly behaviour is still coveted by many? After all, gentlemanly behaviour is based on the premise that females require more protection than males and therefore merit special actions.

Oh, come on!!, I hv being arguing with you small guys all alone without the need of any support nor taking side, why are u so lame as to come out with such childish mentality as to take side kind of shiity stuff again?? Since when I asked anyone to take side, NO no no!, and if people wish to give good comments on my posts or even make some joke out of it, they are alway welcome.

I able to win u anytime, so u dun hv to give way ok.<br><br>Exactly, with yr sissy nerdy style, u may need a gynae, u just dun get it, do u.<br>Oh! now i know i am dealing with a straight jacket nerdy here, sori ya.<br><br>Popcorn runout, pick up the pieces on your shirt ya, u tend to drop, dun waste it, and then drink yr tequila pop ok.<br><br>And what are u trying to achieve my asking my sister here not to take side??, is this a game or is this a vote where majority win. Oh, come on!!, I hv being arguing with you small guys all alone without the need of any support nor taking side, why are u so lame as to come out with such childish mentality as to take side kind of shiity stuff again?? Since when I asked anyone to take side, NO no no!, and if people wish to give good comments on my posts or even make some joke out of it, they are alway welcome. OMG, now then i know that intellect sgmen also behave so childish. </div></blockquote>You able to win me anytime? I doubt that.<br><br>Sissy nerd? Well I have refrained from name calling but since you started it, I think it's a gross injustice to your non-existent abilities if I hold back. After all, I do not wish to deprive someone of the chance of torture if he/she craves for it.<br><br>By asking jojobeach not to take sides with you, I was trying not to get her caught in the crossfire. After all, I feel that she is way more rational than you. By claiming her as your sister, I think that's an insult to her intellect.<br><br>Get it straight, it's a straitjacket (pun fully intended but is probably incomprehensible to you simpleton anyway), not a straight jacket. If you wish to use a word here, at least do bother to google that word and check for its spelling first.<br><br>Now since you turned your target on my favourite popcorn, how can I let you off? After all, when I run out of popcorn, please do not assume that it's a result of me having dropped lotsa popcorn. My mouth is not as hole-filled as your spongiform brain.<br><br>Taking sides, unfortunately, is not a realisation of a childish mentality. In any issue, as soon as you have expressed your opinions, you have taken a stand and sided with a particular viewpoint or another. By claiming that there's no side to take in the first place is akin to declaring that the argument does not exist. You, having said that, is probably a good indication of your primitive neural network being able to come to the conclusion that this argument is pointless. What makes it pointless? Please take a look in the mirror, point your stubby fingers towards it and say, "There lies the problem to life, the universe and everything."<br><br>Alcohol? Sorry, I must profess that I am a teetotaller. I would really prefer a cup of ice-blended mocha to a glass of c0cktail sling. After all, I fear the ability of alcohol to reduce a person to nothing more than a crass pile of nonsense and you are perhaps the best evidence to confirm that fear.<br><br>You have more areas for me to pick on than a tick-infested dog but I think I shall stop here for I am afraid of your brain overloading and exploding. With you gone, the entertainment value here will be diminished just like how circus without clowns and animals are nothing more than a farcical performance.<br><br>Lastly, please do take care your brain. I have a funny feeling that a knife's edge would crush it flat. Do also take note not to sell any semblance of your stupidity. There's already an abundance of your sheer stupidity in the world. Sell anymore of it and you could be embargoed for dumping.</div>
