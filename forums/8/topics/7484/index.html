            <div class='col-md body'>I recently had my first (and last) date with a rich girl. She's the daughter of a businessman, lives in a bungalow at East Coast, etc.  She ordered all the most expensive dishes at the restaurant I took her to, leaving me with the no choice but to order the cheapest food and orange juice for myself as I feared that I did not have enough money with me.  Later, she ordered some coffee costing $6.80 at Starbucks for supper *cringe*.  Not that I'm a cheapskate or anything but that amount of money could have lasted me for 2 days!  She didn't even offer to pay her share of the bill, assuming that I would pay for her.  I don't even know her that well.  My advice to you guys is: Don't date a rich girl unless you're rolling in the green stuff!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Alex, she suggested we eat at that particular place, it wasn't my idea.

            <div class='col-md body'>orange, don't agree that high living standards constitute to materialistic gals..<br>maybe next time if u date a gal out (esp the first few dates when u don't know can get her or not), dictate the place to eat, then u can spend within ur budget loh...don't let her pick those high class place...u can say like this: i don't think that place serve food that value for money, maybe we can try this place XXX...try to take the initiative, it won't hurt the relationship..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmmmmmmm............<br><br>first of all...I know i will offend you with what i am going to post...so I just wanna apologize to you first...  *smile*<br><br>Your thread...It really made me bursted out laughing until my stomach ache...<br><br>You know...In this society...please understand what you got and what you gotta offer before you try to go sian a girl that is way too high class for you.  I am not saying girls are materialistic...nor am I saying that I am.  But you really gotta understand the girl you are trying to sian rt?!  at least know what she likes and how she is as a person...<br><br>I really don't know how old you are, but $6.80 for a cup of coffee is not much at all~ if that is all she is having for supper than you shld be happy!  Somemore you gotta make me laff at you for saying that the $6.80 can last you 2 days...oh gosh!<br><br>You shldn't have taken her to the expensive resturant if you know you can't afford the bill, even if she asked you to, then you can always say no.  What were you thinking?  You don't want her to think you are a cheapsake? You don't want her to know you can't afford it?  You are ashame?  Or better yet, you want to impress her?!?!?!?!  Whatever the reason was, you also had a say in the decision on where to dine.<br><br>I feel like your reason for posting here was to have ppl to pity you...  I might be wrong...but if I were you and this thing happened to me, I will feel damn ashame and hide it!  I won't go posting it arnd and letting everyone know.<br><br>Girls are not becoming more and more materalistic....Don't base your statement on a unfortunate experience on one girl.  I am not that way, and I will never be that way.  If I'm the girl I will offer to pay my share or even the whole dinner, even if it was the first date.  It's just out of respect.<br><br>I know there might be many girls out there that look for free lunches from guys, but if you really think abt it...how can the girl do that if the guy doesn't want to?!  What is she going to do?!  Rob him?! DOH! "If the cow doesn't want to drink the water, you can't force it to"  That chinese saying is so true...<br><br>Anyways...again, I do apologize, but it's just my humble opinion.  I do wish you better luck next time sian'ing girls.  Remember to open your eyes *big big* before you start to sian...<br><br>------------------<br>Float like a butterfly...Sting like a bee...<br><br>[This message has been edited by NaiveGirl (edited 23 May 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Quite agree with what naivegirl had said but then not totally......<br><br>If in the 1st place u know jolly well that u cannot afford the dinner at such a high class restaurant, or that u will get a heart pain n keep thinking of it everyday after this, u did better set yr own plan in the 1st place. i am sure that if everything is planned beautifully, she will be impressed and you will be happy.<br><br>As the chinese say 'wooden door to wooden door ; bamboo door to bamboo door'....... if u wanna date a rich 'da xiaojie', be prepared to liao a lot of money.<br><br>well most human are materialistic lar, including most of u pple who is reading and me as well...... we want a lot of things.....we hope to have a lot of things..... but then, that doesn't mean that the best way 2 get the things you want is to 'chop vegetable head',  :p<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously speaking, if you want to sian a rich girl, then you'd have to be able to afford it.<br><br>On the otherhand, if she's understanding, then she wouldn't mind you bringing her to a hawker centre for a meal.

            <div class='col-md body'>orange, did u voice ur objections when she suggested the place or did she insist on going there? if you didn't, then there is no reason for u to complain now. before this, could you also have given her the impression that you were quite well off? if so, then you can't blame the girl as well. being rich does not mean that she is materialistic. She may go to more expensive places simply coz she can afford to. but to be materialistic is when she only insists on eating at expensive restaurants and drinking expensive coffees.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, Orange, I'm sure she suggested the place because she was familiar with the place, and that you were not firm with your choice of place. Just because a girl is of blue blood doesn't mean that she is materialistic. As long as you are confident in carrying yourself through and letting the lady enjoy herself thoroughly, I'm sure she won't even mind going to the hawker centre for a first date. So one advise, plan your dates next time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>"Don't fight with the sea, dance with it......"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Quarzimodo, thanks.  Glad that someone agrees with me.<br><br>Sparkle, the lady must have gotten the mistaken impression that I was well off because of the nature of my job.  How do you tell someone on your first date that you are actually living hand to mouth?  I tried hinting to her, as in, "the food here doesn't taste that great" and "$6.80 for a cup of coffee, that's daylight robbery".  Guess she just didn't get it.<br><br>Guess I'll have to aim lower, huh?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Orange.. what are you working as actually? Since you are a grad and as you said, working in a highly-respected and well paid (I presumed?) job, I dun see the reason why you would mind that much in paying for your date meal. For me, I dun mind that much, in fact I had been paying for her all the time, occasionally she would pay. Sometimes I feel that it's alright to give the girl a treat once a while, provided I can afford it. From the look of things, you should be able to afford a decent meal and coffee rite??<br></div>
