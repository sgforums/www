            <div class='col-md body'>The last thing u should ever do is to go to WEE LEE (BMC) jaming studio.....the owner "Sam" is a damn @#$ker , the brother (wearing specs) is damn blardy proud when u wanna book a studio or wat shit...it's horrible... Wat's more, if u're a metalist like me, u can forget about jamming there cos they hate ppl playing metal and can't wait to ban ppl.<br><br>The type of guys WEE LEE would like , would be those first timers, who dun know nuts about utilizing the equipment, jamming the cymbals and taking care of the equipment, it's from these newbies taht they earn most of their money from by charging them hell prices when their equipment gets damaged or spoilt. I recall an incident when it was still back in bedok, got this buncha ITE guys next room, apparently when they finished their session, cymbal crack, mic clip crack, drum sticks broken, total bill...hahahha...250 bux. The ITE fellas couldn't do nothing but to leave their guitars there as mortgage first ok...wah lan eh.... so now u can tel me whether WEE LEE is good or not?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Roomful of blues is a cool place to jam in , esp when u've got the money to buy drinks and snacks and everything, but by the time u come out...u'll faint when u see how much u've actually spent. I went there when they were still brand new back in 1997/1998 or something like that....their paintings on the wall are very nice  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Boon is near that "JACKSON" kopitiam and god the equipment sux bad....seriously sux bad. though prices are good...but the equipment is seriously bad....metal zone step also not working, positioning of amplifiers always result in too much feedback. in most of the rooms , they always put the drum set at the center of the room, which is so inconvenient for anything and most of the time the drummer would just wack and no one can tell who's playing wat.<br><br>A really solid studio, which doesn't put on AIRS and stuff would be TNT at Parklane 4th floor(now). It used to be at 5th floor but i guess it still looks the same at 4th floor. the owner "Ah Boy" is a damn cool guy who's patience can tolerate any sorta music, it's from there where most local bands (hardcore, death metal, blah blah) do their demo recordings. Rates wise, last time was 15, now dunnoe liao...i dun use distortion no more.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't get it. How could those ITE guys cause so much damage after one session? Or was it that the owner simply found imaginary things that were damaged so that he could charge more?<br><br>I'm a newbie myself, and the only recording I did was when in a studio in KL.
