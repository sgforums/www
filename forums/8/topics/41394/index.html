About the size of a grain of rice, each VeriChip product contains a unique verification number and will be available in several formats, some of which will be insertable under the skin. The verification number is captured by briefly passing a proprietary scanner over the VeriChip. A small amount of radio frequency energy passes from the scanner energizing the dormant VeriChip, which then emits a radio frequency signal transmitting the verification number.

            <div class='col-md body'>Nope! That is rubbish thinking for now guys. There will never be peace and 1 world unity and all that patriotic mystical crap. Becoz up till now there still exists discrimination. There are many levels of it, countries are discriminatory and so are people. I need not explain more about discrimination, all of us have it.<br><br>As long as it exists, there will be no one world thing. Even if you have a multi racial 1 world government, no one will be at peace becoz there will still be room for insults and racial segragation. I mean look at our schools nowadays...all the malays brotherhood band together....so do the Indian cricket players and the Chinese...all together....there is segregation.<br><br>The only solution i see is to make 1 race of human beings. This can be attained if 1 powerful race now wipes out the rest. This can also be done... if all hospitals insert new genes (of other races absent in an existing embryo) into embryos of babies, that way you would have offspring with all the races; indian, chinese, white, black etc etc. Something like what Napoleon did in Spain, he dicreed each man must mate with a wife of diff ethnicity. If this operation were to be carried out on a global scale, with laws to prohibit pure bloods to produce pure blooded offspring, you would have a new generation of Universal Humanbeings, human beings with all traits and similarities of each other, with no difference in appearance...size...colour and perhaps religion. Soon the older generations of pure bloods will die out.<br><br>This scheme does not prohibit people from choosing lovers as Napoleon did. But it merely tampers with the genetic appearance of the offspring... appearance....becoz all discrimination comes from appearance.<br></div>
