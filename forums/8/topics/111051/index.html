            <div class='col-md body'>Why all job interviews ask many tough questions like a stress test?<br>Just went for an interview.  Spent the whole morning there.  Was there immediately after my breakfast.  Very early.  By the time I came out, it's already lunchtime and I was mentally exhausted, having to answer so many questions.  A lot of my interviews in the past and this one are about two to three hours <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>After that, I talked to an engineer and poured out my frustrations over having to be asked so many different questions at every interview.  To my surprise, his interviews are much simpler.  Interviewers only asked very straightforward questions like "What are your skills?  What are your papers?"  He commented that his area of work requires more hard skills rather than soft, while mine is the other way round.  This is so da mn unfair.  This guy is paid three times more than my last job.<br><br>As much as I can recall, during the first couple of years, my interviews were very easy.  Interviewers did ask questions, but very simple ones.  But during the last few years, I have come across a number of difficult interviewers trying to see whether I could handle stress and difficult situations.  One of them even asked me questions like "You sure you can work under me???" and waited for my response.  Another difficult one asked me "Why should I hire you?" and again he was looking out for my reaction to that.<br><br>Though I can safely say that I have handled all these well, I don't understand why I have to go through all these while there are other interviewees out there who don't have to.  While I really look forward to a new work environment, going to an interview has been a drag for me because of all the experiences that I have had with the nerve-racking interviewers.<br><br>Anybody has any awful interview experience to share?<br></div>

You can get to the bottom line with soft skills as well, but you will need an experienced interviewer who can stick to the relevant points instead of getting sidetracked into amateur psychoanalysis.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by mistyblue:</div><div class="quote_body">Generally people ignore me during the interview. Cause the other member in my team is a chio bu. So everyone like to see beautiful things and focus on her. So I am free to do all sorts of things and observe. Then I throw screw balls or off the cuff questions just to guage the person, change channel and see the reflex. You see, people can always lie and make up stories or prepare until very nice for interviews. But they cannot hide body language.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  I had some added advantage as I used to work for MHA and had some police friends who told me their profiling techniques. But I am not that good but pick up some tips.<br>Its a mind game. In interviews, its always important to be coolheaded and natural. Always be honest. Cause any dishonesty once discovered during or after...will discredit the person.<br></div></blockquote>U offered a refreshing perspective from the interviewer. But as a interviewee, u can often feel the vibe after an interview, whether u stand a good chance or bad chance of getting the job or a 2nd interview, regardless whether u did a good job or make a complete mess out of tihngs.</div>
