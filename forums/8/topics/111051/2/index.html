            <div class='col-md body'>Well.. i feel that job interviews are basically a challenge to yourself on a few areas...<br>1, how well you carry yourself (all that about you that says "hey, im trustworthy and capable!" )<br><br>2, ability to make a good first impression (after all, as compared to a friendship or relationship, interviews are relatively short.)<br><br>3, ability to convince people you are trustworthy and capable (hey, even if u are gonna slack everyday at work and fool around, at least pretend to be good at an interview)<br><br>And of coz, its a chance for YOU to see if you will like your boss.. or if he/she is a rude, pervertic fellow.<br>So basically... interviews are a two-way thing.. to see if u will enjoy working there. So it's not such a bad thing after all rite? I mean... The tougher it is, the more challenging it is. And besides, if u really want the job.. i think its worth it, ya? (:<br><br>But whatever.

I do not think that the interviewer is trying to be mean although some are.

How long have you been at it?</div></blockquote>No, I am a Unix techie who work in the backend, the chio bu is the "team lead" - can talk but cannot work sort. I should say that people move out of this line fairly quickly so I tended to have to take up that interview role as a technical person to assess the person's skills and I cover specific skills only while another colleague covers another group of technical skills.  ie we have at least 4 rounds of interviews with manager and team leads, plus 3 more rounds of interviews with techie people in the team - so I am under this group. (So I tell you people out there, you think your interviews stress? Try mine.)<br><br>Usually interviewers come in with a specific criteria that must satisfy so if people can answer to the point and satisfy that, its a sure win. Just that I notice that the younger people don't present or talk well and worse, the cannot engage in communication with another person. That all talk like Britney Spears, ie: "Like you know lah", "Like, you understand", "Like I am blah blah blah, like..."<br><br>But then, I had my fair share of interviews as well and knows the process, and learn the lessons from them. And I current take Mba which helped me on the HR aspects and I have my criteria on the person. And as I said, being in MHA allowed me interaction with lots of different people and I picked up some tips to profile people based on body lanugage or things that they say. If I truly ask people throughout the interview, people will feel I am interrogating them. If i increase the speed/pace of the interviews, I assure you, people will always burt out what's on their minds and this is a true insight into the person's DNA makeup.<br>But then, if the interviewee is smart and good, they can change the table and manage the interviews as well. ie don't loose all the controls.<br></div>

Thinking of making a move?</div></blockquote>7 interviews. Money is dependent on the location, but its slightly above market.<br>ie India will be cheaper than US, Singapore or Aus. If EU person is to be sourced, we hit scotland or ireland cause they are cheaper than brits. Nothing personal but cost is not the driving force of every CEO and it comes down on our heads.<br><br>Yeah, the retrenched folks are the sad cases. They can sound so unsure and the lack of confidence is really hurting their opportunities. I think rejection is bad, but after a couple of rejections, people should take a different perspective and see positive light in them and grow thicker skin. You cannot believe how many times I was rejected before I got this job and how many other jobs actually I had to apply and also got rejected. The truth is that no one can help you, unless you help yourself.  I had one US candidate who kept repeating he was retrenched, that the team decided he was just too negative and its going to be hard to snap him back. Worse of all, we know the company rolls heads like drinking water, my team might very well be outsourced to india in the next FY and we would all loose our jobs. So in a sense, sometimes, knowing all that, I will not get in a person who has too much to loose if they get retrenched again.<br><br>Yeah, its a measure of honesty what they write in the CV and what they actually know.Its good to confirm the things. I had one indian guy who lied about many things. He's only 21 and he's CV state he stayed in each of the 5 jobs about 1 to 6 months. And he listed so many accomplishments that people only get to chalk up in terms of years. And Seeing his CV, immediately, he was not even granted 1st interview. As I said, never ever lie and always know people had been around long enough to know better. I don't trust the reference they offer, most say good stuff and local people are not really honest. One extreme case, I recall when I enter MHA, they called my references and they send a CID to trail me for 3 months before I got in. I only found out after that. I like to see hobbies, family life and what kind of things this person occupy themselves with. Such as : What kind of a person, is the person a learning person of just someone who likes to be spoon fed, initiative and helpful personality. My agenda is someone who I can work with, teach and learn from and helps out around rather than wait to be asked. Lastly, I hate the sort who will only work on things the boss give and other team members are like invincible and draw lines so clearly such as you did this, I do that and when things broke down, its always my thing spoil his. When things are good, its always his part that made all thing ssuccessful. I have a scot colleague who is like this.

            <div class='col-md body'>To share my thoughts / experiences...<br><br>As my job scope is very specific, I like to get my hands on like mind ppl, this is my normal procedures:<br><br>a.  technical aspect.  Normally i would assess this first.  Some do really look good on paper (strongly recommended by headhunter), but in reality, it is a load full of BS...  I look for major scoring points (only a person with the hands-on experience can he/she describe what I want to hear) to tally up whether the candidate is a good/bad candidate.  Takes about 3-5 minutes.  Got to do interview in Japan, various part of China, Singapore... work well for me.<br><br>b.  Then it is the EQ/PR skills.  This is where I become the devil's avocate, changing direction and moods and line of thoughts every other questions to see the reaction.<br><br>And last but not least, make them a cup of coffee at the start.<br><br>Needless to say also recieved some really bad interviews/jobs... one is where my boss tat interviewed, left 2 days after I join (leaving me to lead the team) without telling me first hand about it.<br><br>Another one is from a headhunter recommendation... 3 minutes into the interview, both of us (interviewer and me) agreed that the headhunter make a mistake becos the job and the person experience dun fit.  I even flew back (lucky was on business trip anyway) for it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by mistyblue:</div><div class="quote_body">7 interviews. Money is dependent on the location, but its slightly above market.<br>ie India will be cheaper than US, Singapore or Aus. If EU person is to be sourced, we hit scotland or ireland cause they are cheaper than brits. Nothing personal but cost is not the driving force of every CEO and it comes down on our heads. </div></blockquote>Hmm - Ireland?  I've heard some horror stories about how they're recruiting there - some agencies are just taking people in on the basis of unverified CVs, and often the applicants are Eastern Europeans who bring their wives and seven kids in before anybody realises something's wrong.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by mistyblue:</div><div class="quote_body">Yeah, the retrenched folks are the sad cases. They can sound so unsure and the lack of confidence is really hurting their opportunities. I think rejection is bad, but after a couple of rejections, people should take a different perspective and see positive light in them and grow thicker skin. You cannot believe how many times I was rejected before I got this job and how many other jobs actually I had to apply and also got rejected. The truth is that no one can help you, unless you help yourself.  I had one US candidate who kept repeating he was retrenched, that the team decided he was just too negative and its going to be hard to snap him back. Worse of all, we know the company rolls heads like drinking water, my team might very well be outsourced to india in the next FY and we would all loose our jobs. So in a sense, sometimes, knowing all that, I will not get in a person who has too much to loose if they get retrenched again. </div></blockquote>I had one case of a guy who used to be the ATM services department head of a bank.  Man, that guy was really down on himself - even his CV wasn't written in an impressive way.  Just looking at his work history, I had an inkling that there was more to it than what he presented, so I kept interviewing him for an extra half hour and, sure enough, he'd done some seriously impressive work.  I did a follow-up two weeks after he was hired, and his boss said he was doing brilliantly. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by mistyblue:</div><div class="quote_body">Yeah, its a measure of honesty what they write in the CV and what they actually know.Its good to confirm the things. I had one indian guy who lied about many things. He's only 21 and he's CV state he stayed in each of the 5 jobs about 1 to 6 months. And he listed so many accomplishments that people only get to chalk up in terms of years. And Seeing his CV, immediately, he was not even granted 1st interview. As I said, never ever lie and always know people had been around long enough to know better. I don't trust the reference they offer, most say good stuff and local people are not really honest. One extreme case, I recall when I enter MHA, they called my references and they send a CID to trail me for 3 months before I got in. I only found out after that. I like to see hobbies, family life and what kind of things this person occupy themselves with. Such as : What kind of a person, is the person a learning person of just someone who likes to be spoon fed, initiative and helpful personality. My agenda is someone who I can work with, teach and learn from and helps out around rather than wait to be asked. Lastly, I hate the sort who will only work on things the boss give and other team members are like invincible and draw lines so clearly such as you did this, I do that and when things broke down, its always my thing spoil his. When things are good, its always his part that made all thing ssuccessful. I have a scot colleague who is like this. He's such an arse hole and he's management background (ie non tech) - expains why he's always political.<br><br>But all this is an Art and Science, some times just plain Luck ... </div></blockquote>Yup, after a while you get a sense of who's talking straight and who's full of it.  I take about 30 seconds to scan a CV, and usually by that time I can gauge how much of it is believable - you're right in saying that time frames are a very good indicator.<br><br>I love doing reference checks.  Some of the beauties I've gotten from referees are:<br>"Oh, her?  She went out for lunch one day and never came back".<br>"If you've got someone else for the job, hire them instead".<br>"I can't imagine why he'd list me as his reference - I threw him out".<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by mistyblue:</div><div class="quote_body">Ah you're perceptive.

My best sales folks are neat and presentable. Not very super looking people. Some of my directors and other members of management and sales/marketing border on not too eye pleaseing/catching. But the way they talk and present themselves are superb. They are what i call people who can talk black into white and white into black. Some very bad customers, these people are sent in to do damage control and win back the customer. Sadly, the best people I know left or were retrenched due to politics from the better looking politicians.<br>I used to have a contractor, who is quite short, plump, his face like the road (sorry lah, my face also like that). No one took note of him, until he open his mouth and people realise he is quality stuff. Mature, handles well, smart, measured. His better looking counter part is just better looking counterpart I would like to do without.  The pretty people in my office are often the vases who latch on to people's work to further themsevles or get into office affairs and then I have people come and tell me all sorts of things I don't wanna know.<br><br></div>
