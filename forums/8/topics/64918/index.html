I was sitting in the mrt wif my ex gf and the train start getting crowded. Then i saw a big tummy lady so we gave up our seat to her and her friend. Then I overheard the friend talking to the big tummy lady.<br>"They think you are pregnant ah?"<br><br>yes, guys shld give up their seats to the elders/pregnant ladies but I think it apply to the women too. Dont tell me that when u see the guys act dumb or blind then the gals also follow suit and become blind as well? I feel it's personal upbringing rather than the gender that we should talk abt.</div>

Because Indians I believe... Due to their cultural background... Many tends to believe in 'power'. As in if you have 'power' you have the say... So that's pretty important to them... Hence, I don't really see the point about 'shared happiness'... It's really nice gesture on their part...<br><br>Talking about Singaporeans... Many though know how to complain the world is not fair to them and even criticise people for their faults, THEY THEMSELVES... Often do not practise what they comment on as 'right' and 'moral'....
