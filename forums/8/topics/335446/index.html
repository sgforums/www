              <p>This reporter (Nur Dianah Suhaimi) obviously needed to find
                              a young super rich spoilt brat for <a href="http://www.asiaone.com/Business/News/My%2BMoney/Story/A1Story20081028-96636.html">her story</a>. It appears that she ended up
                              asking her sister if she had any rich friends (maybe “any of your friends carry
                              LV bag or not?”), interviewed her sister's friend Agnes Lin, and then proceeded to write
                              the story below, essentially turning her into Singapore’s most hated and famous “rich
                              spoilt brat” overnight.</p>

                              Agnes gives her side of the story.</p>

I may be spending a little bit more than my friends but I don't think I'm overspending.'<br><br>At the moment, she has her eyes on the latest mobile phone in the market, the HTC Touch Pro, which costs about $700.<br><br>Although her mother has said 'no' to her buying yet another mobile phone, Ms Lin has an inkling she will still get it.<br><br>'I think my mum will still buy it for me. My birthday is coming up!' she said with a giggle. She confessed that since young, she has never run out of cash. Her parents give her money whenever she asks.<br><br>Since she was 16, her monthly pocket money has been $500.<br><br>She has an older brother, also an undergraduate. The family live in a four-room flat in Marine Parade.<br><br>She thinks a friend of hers, who is left with $20 to last until the end of the month, is silly to consider taking up a part-time job to earn some extra cash.<br><br>'I don't understand why she cannot just ask her parents for money,' sighed Miss Lin.<br><br>She will enter the working world only after three years but she is already planning ahead.<br><br>With her first pay packet, she will buy a $4,000 Chanel bag. 'After that, I will probably get more bags and watches,' she added.<br><br><br>This article was first published in The Straits Times on October 26, 2008.</p>

                      the whole damn world (except my friends and some strangers who left me
                      very encouraging messages on FB) hates me for something i didn't do.<br>and there's nothing I can do about it because I was a dumb shit to have accepted that interview.<br>sigh, good life to me then.<br><br>ok, i think its time for me to speak up, especially since i did nothing wrong.<br><br>Firstly,
                      no i did not call my friend SILLY for wanting to work part time and i
                      did not, for one, said that i do not understand why she cannot just ask
                      her parents. <br>What the reporter asked me was " Do you have any friends you know facing financial difficulties or are in need to money?"<br>I
                      said " Yes, I've got a friend who has only 20 dollars left for the
                      month. I told her to ask her parents but she said no because she want
                      to be independent because she is already 20 and should not be asking
                      for her parents for money so often already.. So she asked me whats the
                      fastest way to earn money."<br><br>WHICH PART STATED THAT I SAID SHE WAS SILLY? HELLO, STUPID REPORTER OBVIOUSLY DO NOT UNDERSTAND ENGLISH.<br>And oh, guess what? She is avoiding my calls like a coward. Sorry Adilah, but this time your sister got me into deepfried shit.<br><br>So
                      tomorrow, I will pick up my AWESOME phone, which i told her is
                      currently a lousy phone because my HTC is spoilt (she did not include
                      that), and dial 63196319 to ST. <br>I will clarify to them that i was misquoted.<br>I want justice done.<br><br>Secondly, what happened to the part where I said I paid for my own air fare and hotel plus my own telephone bills?<br>WHERE ARE THERE?<br>
              <p>I asked Adilah (reporter's sister) and you know what crap she said?</p>
              <p>She
                      said " I can't write that down because She (meaning me) did not want me
                      to write that she is bonded, and if i write that she is paying her own
                      bills, it will show because this means that she is drawing a salary" <br><br>HELLO ASSWIPE!<br>drawing a salary means bonded meh?<br>I cannot work part time meh?<br>Drawing a salary does not necessarily mean that what!<br>pls la, pls....<br>don't give me crap like this just to cover your own shit.<br><br>This
                      whole shit is twisted to the point because she wants to compare between
                      teens who are spoilt fucks and do not need to worry for shit and others
                      who are more concerned.<br><br>ISN'T IT OBVIOUS NOW THAT YOU THINK ABOUT IT?<br>i was misquoted and i want my justice done.<br><br>MARK MY WORDS, TOMORROW WE WILL SEEEEEE<br>WHO GETS THE LAST LAUGH.</p>
