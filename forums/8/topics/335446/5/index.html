Not just the ST does it, so does others, to help reflect the paper's 'weight' on a certain issue.

              <p>And for those that always stereotype rich kids/pple, they will have to slog throughout their lifetimes without much money. Why I say so? Because they dislike the richer pple, or pple with more spending power, so much so that they will never be one unless their mindset changes. Else very contradictory to themselves.</p>

              <p>its an uphill task to say the least.. the best thing to do is not get involved in an interview at all..</p>
              <p>i once got interviewed by my friend for an article in a school tabloid.. not really interview, just chatting over msn.. he asked my opinion regarding an issue, and i responded saying the issue was BAD blah blah.. and when the tabloid came out, he wrote that i said the issue was GOOD... i read and was like "wtf".. but it wasn't anything serious so i shrugged it off.. but i told myself i wasn't gonna do any interviews for any form of publication anymore..</p>

              <p>well dude, u cant stop tongues from wagging.. so no point getting angry with ppl who have had bad experiences with rich kids.. instead of getting angry, channel ur anger into proving that rich kids may have had the headstart, but it's with their own ability that they make a living..</p>
              <p>at least the ppl ard u wun say "my fren is a rich spoilt brat" yah?</p>
              <p>u should know that if u cant change ppl's thinking by being angry.. only action will do the trick..</p>
