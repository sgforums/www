              <p>alot of ppl are too used to $500 allowances. i don't kinda
              approve of it, when ppl of similar age are slogging out at fast
              food chain to earn that kind of pay, while those rich kids just
              laze around, getting that $500 simply becos their parents are
              rich.</p>
              <p>they are the group of people most easily to become out of touch
              with reality, not understanding the hardship ordinary people have
              to go through, living in a sheltered environment, that only exist
              when their parents are alive and working.</p>
              <p>i think that they may never be financially independent in the
              real work, earning a "real-world" wage of $2-4k /mnth with that
              kind of spending habits, unless they are going to take over their
              family business etc.</p>

              <p>hmm.. i'm living in a pretty good life.. but i know that my dad worked very hard for us, and my mum's trifty to a fault.. tts why we can live in a condo and hv pretty nice things now.</p>
              <p>my dad started off with nothing too. since my grand dad passed when he was 20? and my mum's family isn't v rich too. really blessed.</p>
              <p>but i think being rich is also about how u spend ur money? a penny saved is a penny earned, i believe? i definitely.. can't agree to shopping for branded stuff all the time etc.</p>
              <p>i mean, once awhile is fine.. but i know someone who is rather relaxed with money - because she believes that it's alright, so long as you spend within your means.. whereas.. i'm abit more trifty, even if i can afford it, i rather.. not spend it, being slightly cheap, as some would call it?</p>
              <p>but it's also how we were brought up.. like i said.. my parents didn't have much, but because they were trifty, we can live comfortably now. and that's the value i grew up in.. while for her.. her mum's quite relaxed with money too.. splurging on restaurants now and then, and and feeling no pain in buying jewellery like thousand dollar rings now and then.</p>
              <p>and sometimes i feel a little uncomfortable at how they spend.. am i right to feel that way?</p>

              <p> if acne is the problem dun go facial ,go to a docter and ask for clindagel  it works   for me  48 dollars per bottle  last abt 3 months</p>

              <p>I find it quite stupid to interfere with other ppl's life. Esp those who condemn her on her blog comment this, comment that after only reading the newspaper. We do not really understand her in person, why is there so much to condemn?</p>
              <p>I dont really care even if she is really a spoilt brat and look down on ppl who work part time job. It has done nothing useful to me and to the society.</p>
              <p>And if the reporter hav so much time, go dig out useful news like poor old ppl suffering from poverty in spore and increase our awareness of our country. That is why I dislike ST newspaper more and more.</p>

              <p>1. Being rich is a crime?</p>
              <p>2. Admitting that she's rich is a crime?</p>
              <p>3. Having an expensive phone is a crime?</p>
              <p>4. Misquotes can be a very bad thing. Leaving little bits out and inventing other bits can change the story altogether. Even simple summarization of facts can be a bad thing if it changes the context altogether - as what happened here.</p>
              <p>Don't believe me? Instead of saying '<strong>You smell nice today, darling</strong>' to your girlfriend, just try saying '<strong>You smell</strong>' to her. Sentence summarization mah.....</p>
              <p>5. So she has money. And she dreams of buying an LV bag.</p>
              <p>So? She did say that she only dreams of it. I dream of buying a Lamborghini. Am I an elitist scum?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At the end of the day...... what the heck is your beef with her?</p>
