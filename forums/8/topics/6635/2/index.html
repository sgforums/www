            <div class='col-md body'>Just would like to share with those interested an article from MarchÂ’s issue of the Methodist Message:<br><br><strong>Two Issues That Confuse Christians </strong><br>by Bishop Wong Kiam Thau (Methodist Message, March 2000 Pg 5)<br><br>Christians today are bothered by two spirtual issues. Firstly, they wonder whether a spirit-filled Christian speaks in tongue; secondly, they wonder whether speaking in tongue is a sign of a spirit-filled Christian. Let us examine this by the truth as revealed in the Bible.<br><br>Before we look at the issue of speaking in tongue, we must first of all affirm that we Christians are believers in Jesus Christ. He is the Lord of our lives. He lives in us and we in Him. Paul said: <span style="font-style: italic;">Â”If you confess with your mouth, Â‘Jesus is LordÂ’, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved."</span><br><br>One who calls on the name of the Lord belongs to the Lord and the Lord to him. Such a person is naturally filled with the Spirit - he need not necessarily speak in tongue, neither is it a proof that he is being spirit-filled.<br><br>In Acts 4:31, it was recorded that <span style="font-style: italic;">Â”after they prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God boldly.Â”</span> Here we see that the place where they were meeting was shaken, no one spoke in tongue, but they spoke the word of God boldly. The Bible also described Stephen as a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit (Acts 6:5). From these Scripture verses, it is therefore obvious that one who is filled with the Holy Spirit does not speak in tongue, but one who is full of faith, with boldness to witness for Jesus Christ and proclaim the power of God.<br><br>I am not against the speaking in tongue. But I disagree with Christians who insist that those who are filled with the Holy Spirit must speak in tongue. Neither do I agree with those who say speaking in tongue is a sign of being filled with the Holy Spirit. Some even go to the extent of saying that those who speak in tongue are more spiritual or that those who do not speak in tongue are not spiritual or not Â“born againÂ”. Such sayings are unbiblical, misleading and very dangerous.<br><br>We may even fall prey to the evil ones if we place too much emphasis on speaking in tongue. We need to be aware of this lest we mistake the act of the devils to be a sign of being filled with the Holy Spirit.<br><br>I have heard of such a case. During a meeting at a certain theological seminary, a Christian brother began to speak in tongue and the rest of the congregation said: Â“Hallelujay, praise the Lord.Â” The whole congregation began to clap hands and praise God. A missionary from Africa stood up and told the congregation to stop. It happened that the so-called Â“tongueÂ” was actually an African tribal language. That Christian brother who spoke in tongue was in fact cursing Jesus Christ! May God forgive us. This shows that speaking in tongue can be from the evil spirits.<br><br>When a person seeks eagerly after the gift of speaking in tongue, he may even take speaking in tongue as a proof of the presence of the Holy Spirit. This gives the evil spirits the opportunity to fulfil his heartÂ’s desire by letting him speak in tongue. However, Paul reminded us: <span style="font-style: italic;">Â”If anyone speak in tongue, two - or at the most three should speak, one at a time, and someone must interpret. If there is no interpreter, the speaker should keep quiet in the church and speak to himself and God.Â”</span> (1 Corinthians 14:27-2<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>I regret to say that many Christians today neglect one important principle, they all believe that speaking intongue is a sign of being filled with the Holy Spirit; therefore it must be from God, thus they neglect to discern its origin.<br><br>Let us pray that God will grant us the gift to distinguish between the Holy Spirit and evil spirits, so that we may know the truth from the untruth. I believe this gift is more important than the gift of tongue. ~ END<br><br>[This message has been edited by colette (edited 23 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>baNGsTER - ah-huh. in fact speaking in plain english is better, more people can understand mah. speaking in tongue, must have interpretator, no interpretator - don't even know for real or not. i've never spoken in tongue &amp; don't yearn for the ability. sometimes, i speak to God in Mandarin too, on bad days, can also switch to dialects &amp; definitely, He can understand my Singlish if i speak to him in Singlish too.</div>
