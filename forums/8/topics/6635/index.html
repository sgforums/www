            <div class='col-md body'>me been to City Harvest years back as well. That was b4 they had a church building at Katong. The speaking in tongues part is a major part of every service and every cell group meeting. Songs were also widely sang. The mood is always very "lively". Been there for 1/2 yr b4 backslided. Somehow or other it appeals a lot to the younger generation. Looks like it hasn't changed from the days where every service is at WTC or Westin. The people there are real fanatics but quite caring as friends too outside the service.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>T|red, the statement about "obsessed Jesus freaks" was made merely to reflect the original sentiment of the thread. If you scroll down a few lines, you'd read that I am in no way supporting and advocating the condemnation of CH, despite my deep-seated dislike of it all. The church just doesn't appeal to me, although I believe people do genuinely get healed in some of these charismatic ceremonies. And there's a certain, inalienable truth in all of that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Right, that's the thing. Almost every cult in the world turn to charismatism to recruit members. So really, when you're talking about the spirit here, about the thing that keeps it going I don't think it's really God or religion, but pure human zeal, the need for interaction and the "strength-in-numbers" psychology. I bet you can have that same sort of charismatism and recruit members to steal and kill. And with the charismatic approach you can also give your followers a feeling of ecstasy and spiritual fulfillment with each steal and kill.</div>

Hmmm...I've been to CH, and I dun tink i saw any translator there...the pple dun even noe wat they themselves were saying...</blockquote>mmm... I am quite sure that the purpose of tongues is not to confuse Satan. He was an angel to begin with. When you speak in tongues, it's the Spirit guiding you. You are talking to God Himself. You can say that it's a heavenly language. If God wants to speak to the Church through tongues. Then firstly, the person will be in the first place talking in human language but not necessarily one that he knows. Secondly if someone present understands that language then he can interpret lor.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Anyway, I haven't really read in the bible that there's got to be a translator. can you quote it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi iamsilly,  the passage is:<br><br>1 Corinthians 14 v13:  For this reson anyone who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret what he says (NIV)<br><br>1 Cor 14 v6:  Now brothers, if I come to you &amp; speak in tongues, what good will I be to you, unless I can bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or word of instruction ?<br><br>basically 1 Cor 14 is Paul's writing on speaking in tongues.  I m being selective here cos this is the only chapter I know regarding tongues.   does anyone know any other verses ?<br>personally I think its up to an individual how he wants to worship &amp; glorify God. there is no right nor wrong way...even king David praised God by dancing half naked in front of his entire army.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The churches that the movies portray (with particular reference to Joan of Arc) seems to give me a more homely, safe, secure and soothing feeling. I wonder if singapore has any of this cos I dont mind having a 'look-see' at such types or churches.<br><br>I have been to City harvest too, and also one of their cell groups. No offence meant, just a personal preference, that I find chinese temples give me a more settling, calm and soothing feeling.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
