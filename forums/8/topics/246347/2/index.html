Does that means the log from you can be real? as this is a proxy which I been seeing this for several days and one of which have confirmed is you. If you think it bias and unreasonable than you do not need to hid yourself to tell people why is there a need to use open proxy? And if I am not wrong. I did read somewhere that you were massive spamming out a friend picture (female friend) as you are on bad terms with her so you went out to spam to any guys who want her pic and some other stuffs. Which I don't see that is right and following this you got glined with abusive user as reason. Personally I dont see that gline as reason is wrong for what you did.<br><br>People who know me over the years since 1990s in GalaxyNet. I dont support people who abuse their irc ops status. But if you think I am with abuse than is fine. But what i have read from your log and what i find out from others is totally different in your statement you have never post out anything on you spamming the other user pictures to perverts or guys. Why is that so? If it something an oper did wrong I think you should not even worry about posting those information in here too. Why is that so?<br><br>Just my 2 cents. If you think I am talking rubbish let the general public decide.<br><br>regards,</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi foolx,<br><br>I understand how you feel now and the fustrations you are suffering right now.<br><br><blockquote>YOU HAVE NO PROOF THAT, THAT IS HER PHOTO. IT MIGHT BE MINE. I CAN NAME MY DOG MS-MYSELF. SO PLEASE DO NOT RELATE THIS TO THE IRCOPS ABUSING THEIR AUTHORITY. EVEN IF THAT IS SO. IRCOPS SHOULD'NT ABUSE THEIR AUTHORITY. YOU HAVE NO PROOF THAT I SPAM THE PHOTO.<br><br>WE CAN'T JUST SPEAK HERE MAKING UP STUFF OR SO IN YOUR OWN CONCLUSION, WE NEED EVIDENCE. YOU KNOW THAT BETTER THAN ME IRCOPS. </blockquote>But try imagining if someone says that public "I can name my dog PuPuGer.", now how do you feel? Please do remember that humanity does not exist alone. We are a society, please do take care of the feelings of others as well. Please do let me know if this is not coming from you as the quotings are rather messy for me to follow.<br><br>The way you speak to others and the IRCops you are seeking help from are not exactly polite. Please do remember that other chatters are there to spend their time away and that IRCops are volunteers, they do not owe you a living. And they also have the right not to tolerate your crap.<br><br>I also see no reason why you are spamming the photo of others. Have you actually ask for permission from the owner of the photo. As you yourself knows, there are all types of person in IRC, even those that are of evil nature. How would you feel if I post your photo up on porn sites? Ms-myself actually has the right to sue you for that.<br><br>It is difficult to believe they actually registered your nicks just to prevent you from using the nick. You have a theoretical value of 2.35993668438528X10^16 nicks to use in IRC. I do not believe anyone has the right state of mind, time and bank accounts to do just that.<br><br>I believe the way to solve problems it to treat them from their roots. The root, I believe, lies in your attitude. I believe that even if you are now unbanned from the server, given your current attitude, similar cases will still occur again. This is my 1 dust worth.  Hope you would consider changing.<br><br>Thank you and have a nice day ahead.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I didn't said you registered the two nicks. I said it come from same ISP namely comcast and the whole issue started 2 days ago how many ISPs in the whole give you an account right on the spot plus it not worth to pay a month subscription to get an account from the ISP comcast to just locked out 2 nicks u used.<br><br>Someone may have seen u using that nick and may have registered it or u may have used someone nick which they didn't register so there is totally no prove that they register it. in such case don't you think you too have no proof but just base on your own conclusion?
