Being polite at this time is critical if you expect the user to comply. Most users will discontinue cloning and/or flooding if you ask them to do so.</span></span></span><br><span style="color: darkblue;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">* Reasons to /kill or gline: </span></span><br><span style="color: indigo;"><span class="small">1) Clonebots (defined by more than 5 clients from the same host, run by the same user). If the clones keep coming back a local oper should add a local gline to stop the clones. If there are no local opers online at the time, or if the clonebots are on more than one server a temporary GLINE should be set for the appropriate hostmask.<br>2) Floodbots (these deserve instant death). Notice this says BOT and not USER.<br>3) Persistent CTCP flooding of users. Opers please use /ignore or /silence.<br>4) User requests you to kill his ghost. Make sure the hostmasks match, please.<br>5) Spambots are valid kills. Before you do kill it you are required to monitor it for a few minutes. If it's going channel to channel then on the 3rd join do kill it. If it persists then request it to be glined.<br>6) Users who are using our network to spam for another IRC network may be glined on sight without warning provided that such spam consists of contacting users directly via on-join or on-part messages, global messages to -i users, or channel-hopping spamming. Simply having a  channel with the name of another IRC network, or having a topic in a channel which mentions another IRC network will not be grounds for action of any sort.<br>7) Global messaging spammers advertising porn and sex sites may be glined without warning. Users who "team spam" with one client in a channel passing on-join info to another outside the channel may also be glined without warning.<br>8 ) Abusive users. Users which are using their connection to IRC to harass, to pass trojans or viruses, to stalk other users, to inflict damage upon another users computer or system may be glined provided that an A-flag (or higher) oper has determined that these actions are part of a pattern of abuse and not isolated incidents. The user must have been warned repeatedly.</span></span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">* Reasons NOT to /kill: </span></span><br><span style="color: indigo;"><span class="small">1) A fight on a channel. It's not our place to get involved with channel politics. They have the ability to ban the user from the channel. It's not YOUR fight.<br>2) Someone calling you names. You have the option to use /ignore or /silence.<br>3) /msg floods are not consider flooding and should be resolved with /ignore or /silence. Teach users to do this whenever applicable.<br>4) Channel flooding shall result in a channel ban only. This however is under the control of the registered channel operators. If they allow channel flooding on their channel then leave it alone.<br>5) You may not kill a registered channel op for banning you or anyone else. It's their channel and they have the right to ban, including banning operators.<br>6) Repeated kills of a user are not acceptable. Either ask a Administrator to globally gline the user or contact a Oper on that server to have them locally gline. Kill messages are seen by users and   Oper's alike. It is a bad image to pass to the users to see a Oper repeatedly killing a user off IRC.<br>7) Opers are not permitted to kill other opers just for the fun of it. This not only looks bad to the users but serves no useful purpose.<br>8.)

Net-Com can not rule on this since it doesnÂ’t involve global action. Even the administrators canÂ’t do anything about this. ItÂ’s a local server issue. The server administrator would also be free to K line you and nothing could be said or done by the governing body of Galaxynet.<br><br>If you want to pursue this matter you must communicate with the server administrator. If the server administrator doesnÂ’t have a problem with the local G line then youÂ’re out of luck and the matter should be considered resolved.<br><br>If I or any of the other Founders see this again then I will file a complaint with the administrators suggesting your permanent removal from all network services.
