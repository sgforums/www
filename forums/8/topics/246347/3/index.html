THIS IS SO INTERESTING... I took so so long to complete reading everything la.. i know i am quite a no-namer over there in IRC and my knowledge of the IRC is really limited... What about the rules and everything i also don't know...BUT this is surely so interesting as a "battle" betweent an user and IRCops..<br><br>Firstly.. can i ask.. Pupuger.. SO WHATS UR POINT OF SETTING UP THIS THREAD??? TO FIND JUSTICE???<br><br>I mean are you judging the IRCops correctly anot... From what i see that u had posted.. they tried to help you in any ways they could..and your reaction is?<br>ANSWER I DUN LIKE!!! U R BIASED!!! is that how your approach should be? i might be younger than you but at least i know what is justice... I would say that you are looking out for a reply of your liking.. Something like&gt;&gt;&gt; oh ya.. we found out the one who banned you.. its %^&amp;*^^?? U Feel good after that??? Make a big story about it again???<br><br>Justice can never be found if the heart yourself is not non-biased. THINK ABOUT IT!!<br><br>Secondly.. you had not respond to the rest about spamming and sending others picture.. You vaguely avoid the "accused"... Please respond to the others about.. Are You Wrong in the first place... If you say the channel is not registed... You can take over.... den you nick is not registed.. i can use it.. like my nick... it is not registed.. if you see this post u not happy.. feel free to registed it for me... You are taking a stone and slam it on you own feet.... pls....Furthermore..<br><br><blockquote><br><br>YOU HAVE NO PROOF THAT, THAT IS HER PHOTO. IT MIGHT BE MINE. I CAN NAME MY DOG MS-MYSELF. SO PLEASE DO NOT RELATE THIS TO THE IRCOPS ABUSING THEIR AUTHORITY. EVEN IF THAT IS SO. IRCOPS SHOULD'NT ABUSE THEIR AUTHORITY. YOU HAVE NO PROOF THAT I SPAM THE PHOTO.<br><br>WE CAN'T JUST SPEAK HERE MAKING UP STUFF OR SO IN YOUR OWN CONCLUSION, WE NEED EVIDENCE. YOU KNOW THAT BETTER THAN ME IRCOPS<br><br></blockquote>Prove that it is not her foto den... talk so much???<br><br>Thirdly.. I HAVE NO EVIDENCE OR WHAT SINCE U WAN IT SO MUCH.. Just like THEDEAD had said.. leave it to the public to judge.. fortunately.. i belongs to the public.. i come in here coz ur attitude just made it feel like...(up to u to define how ur attitude is)... After this u might just ask me to F*** off... which i intended to do... Is your life so smooth sailing and makes you what you are today??? i nid a few days to pounder over that question.... it puzzles me...<br><br>Crap i had spent so much time here.. 15 mins reading everything 10 mins typing this SH**... time to rest~ Ciao Enjoy you IRCing everybody~</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>IRC is a place to have fun and chat with people, not to abuse them. That's exactly what you are doing PuPu. And all this over a channel? With the mentality you got, it's going to be difficult to see you progress in life. My 12 year old cousin has more logic than you. Seriously, ggrow up. Go online, chat with people and have fun. And the people who are helping her with the abuse, take a long good look in your mirrors and look out for the BIG "L" on your forehead. That's exactly what you are, a LOSER.<br><br>The channel isn't going to give you food or money in your life. Try and understand this, PuPu. There isn't going to be any better logic than what I'm giving you right now. Hope this sinks in for you. Good luck.</div>

Take a look at her friendster pic. Just look at those eyes...there is this "menace" in them, like she's suffering from some mental illness, or cooking up something evil in her brain. She looks like one of those who'll chop up someone because her seat was taken on the bus, or something mediocre like that. There's no way to understand how loonies think. Look at her, she's so thin!
