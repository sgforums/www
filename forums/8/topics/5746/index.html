            <div class='col-md body'>Hello. Ever wonder, if u love someone, would u still have that kind of lovey dovey feelings when u are in a foul mood.<br>Truth to say I just started with my galfriend. We are as u say a new couple. This should be in a 'honeymoon' stage. I agree to a certain extend. But recently from work, I have been tired and stressed. So have she..... We did not have a big arguement or anything like that. Just that we were both - how should I say it - were restraining ourselves. Maybe because we are older and could control our temper better - touch wood! Anyway, with the strain, I find that the lovey dovey feelings are not as strong. Small obstacle. But does this hinder the feelings from growing? Anyone with experience in this? I am afraid the feelings will fade. I think this is the gal for me....but just feeling unsure......sorry if this does not make sense.....confused at the moment....<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi...<br><br>i've been though something similar with yours whereby we reached a stage where we didnt even bother to quarrel..just pushed everything to the back of the mind. However, unfortunately, whether consciously or unconsciously, the resentment and dissatisfaction of being in the relationship will grow, until a day, when u will even feel that you no longer love the person. That was what I thought. Me and my ex just used our studies as excuse for being buzy, and everything became very routine...when we went out, it was always for movies..when we talked on the phone, we hardly have anything to say to each other...<br><br>I'd advice you, since u think she's the girl for you, just take the initiative to make the relationship better again. It doesnt matter who takes the initiative first...coz for my case, nobody wanted to take the first step, and only resented each other for not bothering to put in effort. Now, it's too late for me to have regrets. Give her little surprises, sound lively when u talk to her...it doesnt take a lot of effort does it? The next time u see her, give her a stalk of her rose or her favourite flower, i'm sure she'll be surprised and happy. One little flower can work wonders &amp; it does not require much effort...<br><br>[This message has been edited by sparkle (edited 20 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sparkle, thanks for ur advice.<br>But at the moment, it is not that we are sick of each other. But just that the feelings have toned down. I just wonder will it tone down further? U talk abt resentment, how abt boredom? That could kill a relationship as well.<br>Being lively helps! I know.....when she is sio cheerful and happy, I just brighten up as well.....but maybe I am lousy at this, but when she is upset, I cannot seem to cheer her up......maybe I will try ur advice!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>I had known my galfrend for five years. We plan to get married next year.<br><br>Although we have a good relationship and are getting married soon. I would say that our relationship was very very rocky in the initial stages.<br><br>There is also a "honey-moon" stage where we cannot wait to see each other to talk to each other on the phone and so on. I recalled calling her at her seven times a day, from the time I woke up (b4 I brush my teeth) to the last thing before I sleep. Then after a while, things seemed to sort of hit a plateau. We ran out of things to say to each other. There doesn't seemed to have any new place for us to go.<br><br>I think that if things have been moving very fast for a period of time and then sort of "slows down", one or both parties may not feel comfortable about it. That is what happens to me after about 9 months into the relationship.<br><br>However, if both parties are willing to work it out and wants the relaionship to work, they will have to "work" at it. Don't expect things to turn out well without doing anything. I can't thing of anything specific to advise you but I am sure u can work something out.<br><br>Sorry to say this Guy25, as a man you gotta take the initiative. Don't expect her to do so.<br><br>All the best!</div>
