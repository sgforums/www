            <div class='col-md body'>Haha, Nelstar, I mentioned charming means captivating. Captivating means Attractive too by the way. They pull you towards them. And cute wasn't asked to be defined. And glamourous isn't stylish. Many girls on the streets dress stylish, but are they glamourous? They don't have that "X" celeb-like factor. Not all actors and actresses are glamourous...you must be as BIG as those in Hollywood before you experience the real glam.<br><br>Handsome and pretty hasn't got anything to do with arousing the sexual interest. You're being too horny. When aunties and uncles say, "Hey, what a handsome little babyboy you have!" to a relative, are they sexually interested in him? Duh!<br><br>Flagpole...when you're outside, surely you've seen guys n gals who're good looking but somehow you don't feel they pull you towards them. Those have looks but don't captivate. And like I told Nelstar, those pretty little baby girls and handsome little baby boys...they are certainly good looking, but they don't charm you...I hope?<br><br>[This message has been edited by JustDoIt (edited 30 May 2002).]</div>

Even if the person is ugly but personality is good, he's considered charming. He charms you  with his personality. Handsome juz the looks only.
