              <p>May i have a rant about living in a society? Please, help me understand... don't appreciate non-value-add replies. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Have you ever wonder, what is the point of doing what we do? I mean living in a .. society.. Why do we have to do certain thing, like guys having to serve in the army... Paying CPF... hmm... i just have this nasty thought in my mind.. Why do i, we, as individuals... who have the right to live our life.... however we want, have to do that? </p>
              <p>Why is SOCIETY (merely means, other people) before me? We were all taught that, it's "responsibility of a citizen"... i mean... says who? Is it possible to not be a part of a society? a ... SYSTEM? </p>
              <p>No one asked us whether we want to be part of this right? ... and shouldn't government be FOR the people, and not people for the government? Isn't it the job of government to ensure that it's people have the room, environment to live their life? and not control how they should live their life? </p>
              <p>it troubles me when i ask WHY.. </p>
              <p>The funny thing is... can i even ask the government to release me from my "responsibilities" ? Imagine that yes they allow, and retrieve my citizenship.. i can't stay here anymore.. then i need to look for another group of people (society) to join.. and be part of them... I want OUT...  is it possible? </p>

              <p>I suppose no matter which country you are in...there's an extent to what roles you have to fulfill as a citizen...CPF is a national pension scheme...and it is supposed to help you... pay for housing and medical needs... It's good... though can be better tweaked...</p>
              <p>I guess our govt have their intention in mind and our national interest at hearts...U might not see the full picture but once you are in it long enuf, I guess whatever they do for us has a reason behind it....</p>
              <p>If you are free from all responsiblities, then nobody will care for you... Maybe you are young then you can support yourself, but what if you are in your prime? If the govt sit there do nothing and tell you that it all up to you to deal with your own fate since YOU want it to be... then you are falling into your own hole.</p>

              <p>Would you like your neighbour to blast his hifi through the night? Would you like him to say to hell with rules?</p>
              <p>Would you like the big size family next door to throw you out of your house? Just because they can and there is no one to stop them.</p>
              <p>If you are living on an island all by yourself, you will also have rules to get by. If another person joins you there will be rules of behaviour governing the both of you.</p>
              <p>"Stay out of my area" is a rule, same as "Don't you dare touch my fruit." </p>
              <p>Would you feed him, if he is a laze-about. Would you want him to think why the hell you are doing all this?</p>
              <p>So think about what the point is.</p>
              <p>You want to get out of this group, and into another group? First find out what rules the other group has.</p>

              government may have a valid, good-hearted goal of helping its
              people to save up for their old age (<span style="font-style: italic;">while at the same time used citizen's money
              for investment for more money for the government reserve</span>)...
              say that's their wish. Why are they deciding on what i wanna do
              with my money? Don't i have the rights to sign a whatever form, NO,
              i don't want CPF... anything happened in future is my own
              decisions? Why does SOMEONE have to decide for me? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Whatever policies or ... directive given from the top,
              we rationalized it as something GOOD.. because that's the
              only way we can do, to tell ourselves.. "yeah, it's ok... it's for
              our good." </p>
              <p>It's ok..i'm just ranting.. there is no answer.</p>

              cos cpf is the contribution of the company to ur pay. It's like a "bonus". 
              U can use the money to buy hdb houses in sg and also do other stuffs with it.
              And...u could withdraw a minimal amount from it every month when ur age (i think is 65? not sure about now)
              to spend when u retire.
              But the problem is what if u cannot live that long?
              Money goes to govt.....
