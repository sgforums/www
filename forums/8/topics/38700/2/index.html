            <div class='col-md body'>Since practically the whole world is objected to such a war, why are they insisting the war go on? Even his own country has anti-war protests. Yesterday I saw some students carrying anti-war placards like " no blood for oil" and another with regards to bush. The previous Gulf war was well supported because iraq invaded kuwait, ok fine, the whole whole supported either by force or by picking up the tab for the war.Due to the harsh economic sanctions,the country has little weapons and the people are weakened.Why does such a big country with an array of high-tech weapons still want to wage war on such a small nation in terms of technology. Even the UN inspectors said only some breaches of the resolution like exceeding the range of missiles have been found. Nothing seems to warrant the war to disarm saddam.</div>
