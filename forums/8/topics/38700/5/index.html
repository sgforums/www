I also feel that the US is making use of this situation to attack baghdad.. The US might be making a revenge for the 911 tragedy against iraqs as there are many Muslims in Iraq.

But have they took time to think about by demonstrating for people in Iraq, why then did no one demonstrate in front of a Iraqi commission of such scale as now when Iraq invades Kuwait? If Iraq was let off and decides to do another 'Kuwait' or even worse, what will these demonstrators say then?<br><br>Whatever, it is, I just think it is silly for us common people to take a stand in this situation. Because, it is a lose-lose situation.<br><br>I think, lets just do our part. For those who believe in God, pray. For those who can able, serve your own community. I guess we just need to do our part well because sometimes it is just so easy to take a stand because it doesnt hurt us.<br><br>I may sound a bit unsympathetic here, but if USA has a secret agenda, i do not think its an agenda of world controlling power but more so getting rid of powers that are dangerous.  Some people says that we shld onli strike back when the enemy strikes but when did terrorists ever made known their intentions? As i said, do we wait for saddam to do another 'KUWAIT' b4 taking actions?<br><br>God bless.</div>

Baghdad echoed with the thud of explosions and the shrieks of air sirens; anti-aircraft tracers criss-crossed its skies.<br><br>_ Seventeen Iraqi soldiers surrendered to American soldiers; U.S. officials said they expect mass defections in the initial stages of fighting.<br><br>_ The State Department issued a warning to U.S. citizens abroad that they face a heightened threat of terrorism and anti-American violence.<br><br>_ Across the United States, cities and towns battened down under security not seen since the Sept. 11 attacks. Authorities fanned out to power plants, bridges, state capitols and other facilities to shield them against possible retaliatory strikes.<br><br>_ Coinciding with the initial blitz near Baghdad, about 1,000 U.S. troops launched a raid on mountain villages in southeastern Afghanistan (news - web sites), hunting for members of the al-Qaida terrorist network.<br><br>_ A dust storm that buffeted U.S. troops grouped in Kuwait near the border with Iraq had largely dissipated, giving way to a relatively cool Thursday morning.<br><br>_ The tiny Persian Gulf nation of Bahrain offered Saddam asylum, the first such offer to be publicly extended to him. There was no immediate Iraqi comment.<br><br>_The Iraqi envoy to the United Nations (news - web sites), Mohammad Al-Douri, said he plans to submit a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan (news - web sites) calling the start of U.S. military action against Iraq "a violation of international law."<br><br>_ Israelis carried gas masks to school and work after the opening U.S. attack on Iraq, while Palestinian children in the Gaza Strip (news - web sites) waved pictures of Saddam and burned American flags<br><br></div>
