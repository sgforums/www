It means now comes the turn of the military. The Americans have for the umpteenth time called on Hussein to leave Baghdad, giving him time to ponder and at the same time attempting to scare him with the undoubted might of American weapons. An impression is forming that the coalition's military command and the US administration itself, despite the overwhelming preponderance in strength, fear something and are doing everything possible to persuade Iraqi troops to lay down arms or, at any rate, not to fight too zealously and quickly to surrender.<br><br>Yes, they fear the forces over which they have a multiple advantage. The point is that today "Freedom for Iraq" will indeed have to be won, with no time to wait till it is over as was the case with Desert Storm. Overthrowing the Saddam government requires capturing his capital, and this calls for absolute command of the air at a time when ground forces go into a decisive assault or begin entering the city already abandoned by the enemy.<br><br>Perfectly aware of the US "strategic" designs, Hussein this spring converted Baghdad into a strong point, concentrating there practically all his resources, especially air defence units, in fact deciding not to defend the rest of the country.<br><br>It is Baghdad's air-defence system that worries the Americans most. Literally on the eve of invasion united group air commander Major-General Dan Leaf told journalists that AD forces brought to Baghdad have such fire power that "anyone getting within the hitting range is bound to suffer. All this makes Baghdad a serious problem." Assessing Baghdad's AD system overall, the general is blunt and categorical as a military man: "This is a well-thought out and strong defence. Outside Baghdad alone there are more AD units than even throughout the whole of Iraq during Desert Storm. And there were plenty then".<br><br>In other words, it looks as if there is no avoiding losses, and each military loss, especially in aviation - the most "graphic" and widely publicised US fighting service - will be taken very painfully by public opinion in America and only increase the already numerous opponents of the war in Iraq.<br><br>Trying to "minimise" losses and in general to avoid using their aircraft directly above Iraqi AD facilities, the allies are planning to deal a massive missile and bomb strike from a considerable distance and suppress air defences around Iraq, ensuring flight "freedom" for fighter and military transport aviation around Baghdad. Already in the first 48 hours of the operation it is planned to fire a total of 3,000 high-precision bombs and cruise missiles at the positions of Iraqi anti-aircraft forces.<br><br>No doubt, Iraqis will have tremendous losses, and the Baghdad air defence system will suffer a good deal, but - and this is evident - will not be destroyed completely. Former Soviet SA-3, SA-2, SA-6 and SA-8 air defence systems organic to Iraq's army can "bite" back, especially since lately Hussein has carried out a thorough modernisation of radar stations and deployed them on sectors most threatening to the enemy.<br><br>As acknowledged by the allied command, the Iraqis have deployed vast numbers of air defence artillery, large-calibre anti-aircraft machine guns, and mobile quick-firing twin anti-aircraft mountings of the Soviet ZU-23-2 type along the supposed routes of cruise missiles whose low altitudes and relatively low speeds make them vulnerable to such weapons.<br><br>The New York Times quotes American military intelligence sources as saying that the Iraqis have "surprises" ready for advancing infantry units, transport aviation and surveillance planes. All the territory around the Iraqi capital is covered with a dense network of trenches filled with oil. The oil will be set on fire as soon as the ground part of the operation begins. So fighting will be done in heavy smoke, and targeting data from air spotters will come in with considerable delays.<br><br>The grouping command's particular concern is that perhaps American troops will not be able to suppress and destroy at once the positions on Iraqi territory of Soviet-made surface-to-surface missiles Scud and Iraqi analogues - Ababil-100s, which are today deployed in the area of the Iraqi port of Basra and can well reach Kuwait's territory. Otherwise, the Americans will have to resort to their own Patriot air defence systems. They are of course effective, but one miss would be enough to call in doubt US legendary priority in the military sphere.<br><br>It is a matter of hours now before the first large-scale war of the 21st century begins, and American General Tom Franks, commander of the united allied grouping in the Persian Gulf area, is outspoken when he says: "I feel really superb," meaning the inevitable start of a military campaign.<br><br>Â© RIAN<br><br></div>

It occurred before U.S. bombing and cruise missile raids were launched against targets on the outskirts of Baghdad before dawn, officials told Reuters.<br><br>The U.S. officials refused to say exactly where the "hard landing" occurred or how many troops were aboard in addition to six crewmembers. They said the twin-engine helicopter would be destroyed to keep its high-tech equipment from falling into Iraqi hands.<br><br>The heavily-armed helicopter, designed for clandestine, low-level movement deep into enemy territory, was part of a wide thrust to get elite U.S. forces into areas of Iraq ahead of a major ground invasion "at the appropriate time," according to one of the officials, who asked not to be identified.<br><br>The Pentagon (news - web sites) refused comment. "We do not discuss any operational incidents," said Bryan Whitman, a Defense Department spokesman, in response to questions.<br><br>The MH-53J, most advanced version of the big chopper, is equipped with armor plating and a combination of three 7.62mm miniguns or 50 caliber machine guns.

Why not you write about Japan bombing Pearl Harbour and cause so many innocent lives to be lost </strong><br><br>You think US lose out in Pearl Harbor deal meh? The Jap main target aircraft carriers were nowhere to be found. US purposely let Jap whack them then they can have a valid excuse to enter WW2 and also to encourage their US people to war cuz at that time US ppl are reluctant to enter a war that is none of their business.<br><br>Sacrificing those US men in Pearl Harbor is a must to play the game. US politicians are cunning and sly people. I think some have Jews blood in them.[/b]</blockquote></div>

There are widespread expectations the North will soon test a ballistic missile.<br><br>State-run KCNA said annual U.S. military exercises being held in South Korea showed the United States wanted to dominate the world by taking out Iraq and the North.<br><br>"What merits serious attention is that the DPRK-targeted saber-rattling is being staged in real earnest, timed to coincide with the U.S. attack on Iraq," the agency said.<br><br>DPRK is the acronym for the North's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.<br><br>South Korea's Unification Ministry said North Korea had been informed in advance of these annual exercises and the U.S. army said the drills were planned nine months ago.<br><br>"INTOLERABLE HOSTILITY"<br><br>The North Korean organization responsible for handling ties with the South told Seoul it was "adding fuel to the flames of war kindled by outsiders" by taking steps to prevent adventurism by Pyongyang during the Iraq war.<br><br>"The South Korean authorities, under the manipulation of the U.S., kicked up an anti-North racket with the Iraqi war as a momentum," said the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland.<br><br>"This is an undisguised challenge and intolerable hostility toward the North," KCNA quoted the committee as saying.<br><br>KCNA referred to reports in South Korean media which said the South had raised its military alert status. Seoul flatly denied those reports on Thursday.<br><br>Seoul's Unification Ministry said on Friday Pyongyang had ignored South Korean statements saying the Iraq conflict must not be allowed to hurt inter-Korean relations.<br><br>"We cannot but voice regret that North Korea is making assertions contrary to the facts and casting doubt on our conciliatory intentions," the ministry said in a statement.<br><br>North Korea has long sought to drive a wedge between South Korea and the United States, military allies since 1953. On Thursday, the South's President Roh Moo-hyun voiced support for the U.S. war in Iraq and offered to send 600 non-combat troops.<br><br>The North also told South Korea on Friday to stop loudspeaker broadcasts of propaganda across the Demilitarized Zone frontier -- the world's most heavily fortified border -- or face serious consequences.<br><br>NORTH "NOT SELF-DESTRUCTIVE"<br><br>KCNA said South Korean propaganda messages across the DMZ had resumed after a lull. The two Koreas had agreed to stop 50 decades of high-decibel cross-border slander in 2000.<br><br>"If you do not take immediate measures to halt these damaging messages then you will be completely responsible for the serious consequences that result," the North's military said in a letter to the South, according to KCNA.<br><br>South Korea's Defense Ministry said it had received the letter, but denied it was transmitting anti-North messages.<br><br>"We usually broadcast music, the latest news on inter-Korean relations, the Iraq war, and so on -- but we don't broadcast anything slandering North Korea," a ministry spokesman said.<br><br>Analysts say they can only guess whether North Korea will make any moves during the Iraq war.<br><br>"The next two or three weeks are critical when it comes to the North Korean issue," said Derek Mitchell, Asia analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.<br><br>"We will see if they intend to provoke or if they will step back," he said.<br><br>Commentator Han Sung-joo, a former foreign minister, said North Korea was considering various lessons from the Iraq war.<br><br>"I don't think North Korea will be too adventuristic in taking advantage of the situation in the Middle East," he said.<br><br>"North Korea is not necessarily wise or prudent, but it is not self-destructive," Han told a foreign policy forum in Seoul.<br><br></div>

British forces said they ran into "stiff resistance" as they moved against Umm Qasr to the south.<br><br>Thick smoke filled the skies from fires at some of the many oil wells and processing facilities in the region, where pipelines funnel Iraq's economic lifeblood through the al-Faw peninsula to the Persian Gulf.<br><br>Iraqi troops set fire to 30 of the hundreds of oil wells in the region, British Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon said. Iraq has 1,685 oil wells and exported 2 million barrels daily before the war.<br><br>British troops took the southern portion of the peninsula in the first hours of the ground war, but at a cost: eight British and four U.S. Marines on a CH-46 Sea Knight helicopter that crashed.<br><br>Hoon called the peninsula's capture "certainly a significant strategic success. It means that we have a bridgehead from which to operate, but crucially it means that part of the plan of the Iraqi authorities to destroy their oil wealth has been averted."<br><br>But he said troops encountered "stiff resistance" from Iraqi forces defending Umm Qasr, 20 miles south of Basra, but predicted it would soon fall to coalition forces.<br><br>Day broke in the area with U.S. and British forces responding to the Iraqis with artillery, muzzle blasts breaking like lightning, sending frightened dogs running across the roads of abandoned farm towns. Jets attacked one position to the west of Umm Qasr, lights sparking in the air as bombs dropped.<br><br>The 1st Marine Division needed air support to suppress Iraqi mortar and small arms fire while seizing Route 80, which leads from Kuwait to Basra.<br><br>"Every now and then they pop off to let us know they're still there," Lt. Col. Steve Holmes, a Marine in charge of clearing berms for troops and armor to enter Iraq.<br><br>Supported by Cobra attack helicopters and howitzers, Marine tanks and armored vehicles rolled down Route 80 through the demilitarized zone between Kuwait and Iraq.<br><br>Tanks were placed on berms to provide cover for Marines moving on the road.<br><br>Until then, the Marines had taken side roads. Route 80 allowed a faster approach to Basra itself, and hundreds of Marine vehicles moved up it into Iraq.<br><br>The Marines had encountered resistance in the area for several hours Friday morning after moving to attack the nearby town of Safwan, which fell within hours.<br><br>The military continued to broadcast warnings to civilians in the area on loudspeakers to stay indoors and urging Iraqi troops to surrender.<br><br>On the Kuwait side, Marines in a sandbagged watchtower directed mortar fire at the Iraq side, where U.S. troops have watched the Iraqis, who appeared to be either digging defensive positions or setting land mines. "We'll find out soon enough," Holmes said.<br><br></div>
