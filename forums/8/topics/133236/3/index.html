Cheow<br><br>A*Star Chairman Philip YeoÂ’s recent comments that he prefers giving scholarships to foreigners and girls has led to a surge in sex change operations and emigration.<br><br>In a recent interview, the ever voluble Mr. Yeo gave Bush UN appointee John Bolton a run in the diplomacy stakes when he told The Nude Paper that Â“I donÂ’t want whining Singapore boys. They are not mature enough even though they have national service and are over 22 years old when they take up undergraduate studies. They give me so much trouble and waste our precious time.Â”<br><br>The StateÂ’s Times then did a follow up piece on the brouhaha that ensued, and even included a pinup of a woman A*Star scholar agreeing with Mr. Yeo, and hypothesizing that Singapore men start complaining because theyÂ’re not used to army regimentation or physical training.<br><br>In the wake of his comments, Singapore hospitals are apparently now backed up with bookings for sex change operations Â– all by prospective male scholars.<br><br>Â“Boh pian lor,Â” said prospective scholar Khee Tuck Chek. Â“Mr Yeo says weÂ’re too wimpy, but also says we should be more like girls. IÂ’m damn confused, man! But I really want the scholarship, so I think better potong to improve my chances.Â”<br><br>Similarly, Lieutenant (NSF) Desker Loh has begun taking oestrogen to improve his chances of scoring a scholarship to study biotech.<br><br>Â“What better way to demonstrate my sincerity than to experiment with my own biology?Â” said LTA (NSF) Loh, displaying significant cleavage. Â“Anyway, I also think I can tap into Mr. YeoÂ’s preference for girls, because in NS, I was in the Music and Drama Company.Â”<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s true that we guys get whiny thanks to NS,Â” said Corporal (NSF) Choe Sai Kang, who is also contemplating an A*Star scholarship. Â“But thatÂ’s all you can do when you encounter stupidity and canÂ’t do anything about it because if you do, youÂ’ll kena DB. Anyway, if weÂ’re whining about A*Star scholarship conditions even after doing NS, what does that say about A*Star except that theyÂ’re more condemned than the SAF? I guess thatÂ’s Singapore for you: they want us not only to face up to stupidity, they want us to like it too.Â”<br><br>Those who canÂ’t bear changing their sex, have opted to change their nationality instead.<br><br>Â“After taking two years of shit for my country, not only is it not appreciated, IÂ’m told theyÂ’d rather have foreigners who have never endured a single day for Singapore,Â” said Mr. Mohd Cabut bin Negara. Â“I wish IÂ’d known earlier. If so, IÂ’d have emigrated long ago so I can be the kind of person that Mr Yeo wants for Singapore.Â”<br><br>Meanwhile, a spokesman for A*Star has said that the hoopla has only proven Mr. YeoÂ’s point that Singapore men are whiny, thin-skinned girly men who canÂ’t take unpleasantness.<br><br>Â“Yeah, right,Â” said Corporal Choe. Â“I really accept that criticism from someone who threatens to sue obscure bloggers for defamation.Â”<br><br></div>

Mr Perfect (aka Curt Hennig) died in his hotel room sometime last year or the year before. Apparently he died of a drug overdose.<br><br>Anyway.....this male vs female thing has been going on for such a long time, even in the local newspapers that its getting boring. The solution is very simple what, girls that cannot stand local men go look for foreigners. Same goes for local guys who cannot stand local girls. What's there to complain about?<br><br>Newspaper reporters must be running out of topics to write on.....or are there far more female reporters compared to the men in the newsroom? What goes around comes around though...and these female reporters writing the male bashing articles might just end up like Sumiko Tan.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>

Even our superior in NS once mention tat what officer say is always right n no arguing back as to respect the stupid rank. As a NSF, i dun even give a damn to rank, ranking system only hinder freedom n working. Too bad we can't scrap away the ranking system...</div>
