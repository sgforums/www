              <p>It has been 5 years since I last wash my air con. It is no longer cold so I have no choice but to call people down to service my air con today.</p>
              <p>I called the air con company and they send 2 guys down to my house today.</p>
              <p>The 1st guy told me that it cost $100 to do chemical cleaning for my room air con and another $180 to do chemical cleaning and gas topup for the air con condensor. Total will be $280. He say that if I do not clean the condensor it may spolid.</p>
              <p>I say that it is too expensive.</p>
              <p>The 2nd guy say that he can do my air con condensor for $150 but he will not include it in the receipt meaning the $150 will be spilt equally among the 2 guys and will not go to the company. I agreed and ask him why the lady on the phone told me that chemical cleaning cost $80 to $100 and why he charge me $100. He say it is because mine is a big air con. For small air con it cost $80.</p>
              <p>I told him to charge me $80 for my room air con. He agreed.</p>
              <p>So on the receipt he wrote chemical cleaning for room air con $80. The other $150 he and his friend spilt among themselves. So his company only gets $80.</p>
              <p>He told me not to tell his company or both of them will get sack and I agreed.</p>
              <p>Coming back to think about it, these 2 guys are so evil. Use the company equipment to wash the air con and they take the money for themselves.</p>
              <p>I also feel that I am cheated. $150 to wash the air con condensor. Isn't that too expensive?</p>

              <p>My air-con serviceman does that water hose to wash the condenser free for me, it's included in the package. He also uses a vacumn to clear out the drainage pipe for me FOC, sometimes I ask him to use chemical on the drainage pipe (also FOC).</p>

              <p>He does a very good job, cause I see with my own eyes, he strip down the air-con unit (only left the pipes and wires sticking out from my wall), took the blower outside my house to chemical and rinse. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>New air con don't need chemical condenser, only need chemical blower in 2 years. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>An air-con unit that is more than 10 to 15 years old, won't last much longer. Have you thought about your compressor spoiling on you tomorrow? You would have wasted money chemical cleaning your compressor, it will cost at least $600 to $700 to replace your compressor, with the extra $230 you paid, might as well get a new air-con. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
