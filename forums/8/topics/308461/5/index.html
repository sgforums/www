              u r sooooo wrong...y guys dun wear skirts is cos we noe how the society wil view us if we do...u made it sound as if u realli understand guys, but actually u dun...n u completely miss my pt...
              
              the object being tested here is skirts...the variable here r the ppl wearing them...to test whether its justifiable to say tat its inconvenient to wear skirt, u must put the ppl wearing them to the test...if all gals in the world can say tat skirts r inconvenient to wear n they hate skirts, then the problem lies in the skirts...however, if we can find soem gals who dun mind or like wearing skirts...then we cannot say tat the problem lies wif the skirts...
              
              when i say the problem lies wif the gals, wad i meant was its due to the difference in character, personality, preferences of different gals...becos we have all been created differently, there will always be some who like skirts n some who dun like skirts...so its down to individual preferences n nt the object been tested since all gals have had experiences in wearing skirts but they can have different opinions abt wearing them...
              
              tis is all i am going to say...if u stil cun get wad i am driving at...then forget it...

              <p>i tink TS is stil a small mei mei lah…let us nt be too harsh on her…let her go lah hor…she hasnt seen enuff of tis world to make conclusive opinions…she is tsil growing up…i have seen gals who were tomboys when they were growing up but became feminine(wear skirts/dresses) when they became adult…for eg…jamie teo n yvonne lim…both confessed being tomboyish when young but ater grooming in <span>TCS</span>, they became feminine…</p>

              wad i mean is dun be so sure tat tomboys wun become feminine women in future...if u ask yvonne lim n jamie teo when they were younger, i dun tink they would have seen themselves being feminine when they grew up...but look at them nw...situations n circumstances can(though not definitely)change a person...
              
              i am nt asking u to go mediacorp...i am juz stating examples of tomboys who have grown to like wearing skirts...so its the personality n character of the females n nt the wearing of skirts tat is the issue here...the skirts r always there..whether or not to wear them depends on the different mindsets of gals...some wil wear them, some wun...for u, u find them inconvenient n uncomfortable...but for other gals, they may like wearing skirts cos they find skirts comfortable n nice...my gf is one such example...she claims tat pants can be rather hot at times...
