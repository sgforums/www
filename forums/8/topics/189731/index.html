            <div class='col-md body'>Electronic gadget replacement rate is so fast that it is hard to keep track. For ppl majoring in this area need to constantly upgrade themselves instead. First there is pager than handphone... black n white then handphone with color then now got music can play etc etc...<br><br>Similarly there is walkman then CD player and then now mp3 player.. it is always changing... I have to admit I am old indeed.<br><br>Pager if it is cheap is still used by corporate companies like paging those 24 hours standby IT personnel in case backend server break down. So as for home user I doubt the demand is there. In fact I tink pager is predominantly used by companies to recall back employees cuz it is still cheaper.</div>
