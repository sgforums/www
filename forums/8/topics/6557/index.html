            <div class='col-md body'>hallo fellow forumites,<br>i have always been interested in the paranormal activites, especially as regard to local happenings. I myself have experienced a few things 'interesting" as readers to the "what is the spookiest place in s'pore" can testify. At the last thread, i mentioned Lim Chu Kang and temple hill...now hear what my friend have to say abt this...:<br><br>hi guys, my name is Andy. i used to serve in 1 SIR during my NS back 2 years ago. Those were horrific days in which i slogged thru for 2 and the half years. Years spent in the wilderness of Mandai and the hills of Lim Chu Kang. *shiver* Lim Chu Kang still brings back bad memories for me...<br>Ever heard of a place called temple hill at Lim Chu Kang??? I believe those who went thru SISPEC will know that place. Well, i was there once for some boliao excerise...at the goddamn hungry ghost festival period somemore!!! Of course,at that time, i did not put too much significant into the date.<br>During the last few days of the excerise, me and my sergeant were "volunteered" to recce the area around temple hill.<br>Cursing our luck, we set off for the area immediately.Soon, we reach temple hill, noticeable by one very old temple in the middle of nowhere and a large Chinese pillar in the middle of the dirt track road.<br>We find some bushes to hide ourselves and at the same time took a puff.<br>After 15 mins, we decieded to get back to our camp and as we raised our ass from the muddy ground, my sergeant looked up and frozed...i followed his glaze and i nearly pissed in my pants. There was a body hanging from the pillar...and the head was rising slowly until they stared straight at us. My sergeant just gripped my arms and dragged me away before we both broke into a run. We ran back and reported everything to my PC. He took a few men and went back to investigate.<br>As u guys have guess it, there was nothing there at all, no hanging body no nothing.<br>We got a good scolding from my PC for disturbing the unit and spreading rumours...and kenna 2 extras for negligences of duty.Tok abt unlucky man...<br>Later back at my camp, i hear my encik mentioned to me and my sergeant abt the temple hill...seems like someone committed  suicide there...mystery is, nobody has ever discovered how the hell he hanged himself there...<br>those who have been there will know what i have been toking abt...<br><br>Thats it folks, thats what happened to my friend at temple hill few years back. So funny, we seems to meet such things when we served our N.S...could it be something has a fetish for army boys?!?! sigh, better hit the table before something really BAD happened to me.choy choy...<br>More to come next time...fellow forumites are welcomed to share their stories with us too  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>cheers<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>
