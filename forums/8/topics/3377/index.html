            <div class='col-md body'>I am very disappointed with my own dad. He always a guarantor for his friends when they loaned money from loansharks...in the end, they ran off and he had to pay. When we asked him not to do that anymore...he said how can we be so heartless to his friends.......then why is he so heartless to us?<br><br>When we happened to be sick, as a father, he dont even ask how are we...not a word of concern from him. I remembered this one time when I had measles when I was in primary 5, my mother is the only one to take care of me, bring me to clinic, feeding me medicine...and my dad came home only 3 times a week and always drunk. He dont even give my mum money for the medical fees...in the end, she had to borrow money from my aunties and uncles. When me and brother were in school, we had no money to buy books....we had to borrow from my grandmother, in the end he took the money to gamble it all away...we were in very desperate state....<br><br>Me and my brother never taken allowance from him...ya lah..sometimes $15 per month when he feels happy during our secondary school time, ...but that is really rare...I had to work since sec three to support my bro's school fees and myself...<br><br>My brother had met with motorcycle accident last 2 weeks and just had an operation on his hand...he was hospitalized for 3 days...and cant even use his hand...he had to stop working coz his work as technician is greatly affected by that....my dad didnt even open his mouth and ask how is my brother, never even come to the hospital to visit him...when we told our dad, he said he has no time, or simply he just ignored our pleading. He is retired and got the whole world of time. what he mean he got no time?? every day he just sit on sofa and play his stupid handphone games...and watch TV.<br><br>My brother told me this morning...which also why I posted this message...he asked why is our father so heartless...when he needed money to pay his friends debts, he will ask from both of us...but when we need concern, he really know how to siam....<br><br>I am speechless....in my heart I pondered although I didnt say anything...I knew how irresponsible he is as a father, I rarely talk to him since my secondary sch time and had tried to communicate with him again last two years...thought things will get better...until my brother's incident and I realised, he is still the same...we are disappointed in him....very disappointed..<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>I cant tell anyone how I feel or even share my problems with my close friends...coz i cannot put my thoughts into words...everything is bottled up in me. I went through depression state during secondary sch time..and at a point, I really wanted to end my life, and had actually tried to end it...unsuccessfully...<br><br>although I am now more stable and settled, the negativism and depression never really go away, just that I am good in hiding it from friends and family...ppl may think i am positive and cheerful, but only me know better.......<br><br>sorry I had talked too much.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> just need a space to vent my feelings on...so here I am posting whatever on my mind.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> thanks for listening.<br>------------------<br>By sufferings only can we know,<br>The nature of the life we live;<br>The temper of our souls they show,<br>How true, how pure, the love we give.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Liping (edited 09 February 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe that this is a time for christians to start praying for Liping and let God start working on her situation. Pray that God will intervene her family situation and give her love, joy, peace in the household and may she come to the saving knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ.<br>May the Lord help her father to learn to say "No" to his selfish friends and he will be strong and start to be a good husband and father (it's not too late to start, better than never start).<br><br>Liping, please share your progress with us because you can be our christians' testimony.
