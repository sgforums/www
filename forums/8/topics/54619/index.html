            <div class='col-md body'>We always hear "the rules" from the female side.<br>Now here are the rules from the male side.<br>These are our rules. Print this out and remember it.<br>And don't moan.<br><br>If you're a Man pass to your partner for a greater<br>understanding. If you're a woman keep it somewhere<br>prominent like on the fridge.<br><br>* Learn to work the toilet seat. You're a big girl.<br>If it's up, put it down.<br>We need it up, you need it down.<br>You don't hear us bitching about you leaving it down.<br><br>* Birthdays, Valentines, and Anniversaries are not<br>quests to see if we can find the perfect present<br>yet again.<br><br>* Sometimes we are not thinking about you.<br>Live with it.<br><br>* Saturday = sports.<br>It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides.<br>Let it be.<br><br>* Don't cut your hair. Ever.<br>Long hair is always more attractive than short hair.<br>One of the big reasons guys fear getting married is<br>that married women always cut their hair,<br>and by then your stuck with her.<br><br>* Shopping is NOT a sport.<br>And no, we are never going to think of it that way.<br><br>* Crying is blackmail.<br><br>* Ask for what you want. Let us be clear on this one:<br>Subtle hints do not work. Strong hints do not work.<br>Obvious hints do not work. Just say it.<br><br>* We don't remember dates.<br>Mark birthdays and anniversaries on a calendar.<br>Remind us frequently beforehand.<br><br>* Most guys own three pairs of shoes - tops.<br>What makes you think we'd be any good at choosing<br>which pair, out of thirty, would look good<br>with your dress?<br><br>* Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers to<br>almost every question.<br><br>* Come to us with a problem only if you want help<br>solving it. That's what we do.<br>Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for.<br><br>* A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem.<br>See a doctor.<br><br>* Check your oil. Please.<br><br>* Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an<br>argument. In fact, all comments become null and void<br>after 7 days.<br><br>* If you think you're fat, you probably are.<br>Don't ask us. We refuse to answer.<br><br>* If something we said can be interpreted two ways,<br>and one of the ways makes you sad or angry,<br>we meant the other one.<br><br>* Let us ogle. We are going to look anyway;<br>it's genetic.<br><br>* You can either ask us to do something or<br>tell us how you want it done. Not both.<br>If you already know best how to do it,<br>just do it yourself.<br><br>* Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to<br>say during commercials.<br><br>* Christopher Columbus did not need directions,<br>and neither do we.<br><br>* The relationship is never going to be like it<br>was the first two months we were going out.<br>Get over it. And quit whining to your girlfriends.<br><br>* ALL men see in only 16 colours,<br>like Windows default settings.<br>Peach, for example, is a fruit, not a colour.<br>We have no idea what mauve is.<br><br>* If it itches, it will be scratched. We do that.<br><br>* We are not mind readers and we never will be.<br>Our lack of mind-reading ability is not proof of how<br>little we care about you.<br><br>* If we ask what is wrong and you say "nothing,"<br>we will act like nothing's wrong.<br>We know you are lying,<br>but it is just not worth the hassle.<br><br>* If you ask a question you don't want an answer to,<br>expect an answer you don't want to hear.<br><br>* When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything<br>you wear is fine.<br>Really.<br><br>* Don't ask us what we're thinking about unless you<br>are prepared to discuss topics such as beer and boobs,<br>the offside rule, or cars.<br><br>* You have enough clothes.<br><br>* You have too many shoes.<br><br>* No you really do have too many shoes.<br><br>* It is neither in your best interest or ours to take<br>the quiz together.<br>No, it doesn't matter which quiz.<br><br>* BEER is as exciting for us as handbags are for you.<br><br>* I'm in shape. ROUND is a shape.<br><br>Thank you for reading this; Yes, I know, I have to<br>sleep on the couch tonight, but did you know we really<br>don't mind that, it's like camping.<br></div>
