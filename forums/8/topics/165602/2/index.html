Everything evolves over time. Put an orang utan, or even a dolphin (dolphin has good evolutionary potential according to evolutionary biologists), on this tiny island, plus billions of years, and Walla! What do we have here? Harbors with an efficient political party complete with impressive GSTs and COEs. Top this up with naked animals from the Far East that somehow prefer to frequent Geylang, and you have a country almost as good as Singapore. And Homo sapiens thought they could dominate the world forever. Wait until the dolphins start walking from water to land.<br><br>I agree that Â“all of us built this country to be what it is todayÂ”. So, my friends, even if Sang Nila Utama did not walk the shores of Singapore, I believe Hamirra could have done better.<br><br>Finally, please do not discriminate against wild animals. They contribute to the ecological balance of this Â“flower islandÂ”, not forgetting those critters that wander around HDB blocks. They all participated in the building of Singapore, including my dogÂ’s great-great-great-great-grandpa who pissed at the tree opposite my primary school 60 years ago. That tree is still strong and healthy, and thriving on nitrites.<br></div>
