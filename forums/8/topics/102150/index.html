            <div class='col-md body'>i think its because the victim is a primary school kid. possibly raped then killed? aiya.. i don't know why is the writer for that "sammyboy" biatch so much.. at least those people donated and helped out one family.. what about that writer? did he do anything at least? talk is pretty cheap, moving a few fingers on a keyboard is even cheaper.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>charity is kinda free will, the people choose who they want to help, i really don't see what's wrong with that. is it wrong if i choose not to donate money for the "Cremate Huang Na Foundation" but i use the money to donate to old folks home? is it wrong if i choose to donate vice versa, instead of donating to old folks home, but donate to Huang Na's family? is it wrong? both way is also helping people wat.<br><br>am i right or wrong?<br><br>i don't believe in "rights and wrongs" regarding helping other people out. you can't save the whole world, you can't relieve the pain of every grieving family, but you can do your small part to help some people. its good enough. why are we discriminating against PRs? are they not human who feel too? huang na's family, only the mum is in singapore, the husband is only here on a permit. if no one helps them, who will? they have no family here. sometimes, you people have to think a little, look at the bigger picture..<br><br>is helping people more important, or the legalistic points of "who deserve the help" more important?<br><br>who are you to judge the hearts of the people who help others? are you in the position to judge? have you done your part to help others who have suffered? have you earned your right to judge whether they help others only to "look good"? *laugh out loud*<br><br>Here's a quote for you all, i'm sure you've heard it before: <span style="color: red;"><strong>"If you aren't part of the solution, you're part of the problem."</strong></span></div>
