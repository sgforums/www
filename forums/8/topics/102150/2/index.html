We are indeed a Whiteman's Paradise. Whats up with the government? But we only have ourselves to be blamed. Because we just refused to reproduce. In Social Studies, we learn that the reason why Gahmen import foreign talent is because of the need to increase the population of singapore due to our falling birth rate. This is to ensure that the quality of productivity in the workforce would not be affected.

There can be many conclusions. For those seeking power, in one way, you can say "The pen is more powerful than the sword".<br><br>For those seeking an all encompassing compassionate world, this means two things (1) You can influence the masses compassion through mass media; (2) For proactive charity, it may be best to look for less-publicized charity organization to donate your dollars or help. Those maybe the ones who really need $$ or help but are not getting it, due to lack of media attention. This includes a simple helping out your neighbours who may be in need of help. There are a lot of ways you can help to make a better world through simple actions of helping people around you everyday.</div>

As for the Peidu mothers and people who said that we should puty the peidu mothers for their hard work. get this straight. Singapore did not ask them to come here and then find that they have to "suffer" with affairs and prostitude themselves for $$$. They could have been educated in their own country better than they can over here. So don't tell me to pity them. They had a choice, they didn't do their research and they come here and pretend pitiful with us. Now, our forefathers come here and worked their ass off to get us into this state. These women come here and assume that money comes out of walls and its our local people's responsibility to ensure their welfare and spreading aids???? this is ridiculous. Get your mind straighten up.<br><br>I used to live with one peidu. She fu.ck around the house with her men and she would leave the kid along for long hours late into the night. She would kick the kid out of her room while she had s.e.x with her men. I see the kid and her fu.ck up attitude and her unhappiness all written on her face. I think to myself, you mother choose this for you. Don't blame me and Singapore for your situation and don't think you are some great China product cause, to me, the young girl is going to grow up like her mother. And so many China person I met, 9.9 out of 10 are disgusting, uncivilized money grabbing creatures who do not have a heart.<br><br>my indian colleagues saw our HDB rulings and laughed that our own gov treated foreigners better than locals and understand that's why so many of us want out. So I agree with FI.. but I do think there a a couple of smart locals. Most locals don't bother to voice out cause it does nothing and most locals don't handle dissention well and cannot discuss topics without getting personal. Locals like to see nice and good things aand or pretend things are all wonderful. When anyone discuss such things, they will be labelled and people will ostracise them or criticise them. To me its a social conditioning thing.<br><br></div>
