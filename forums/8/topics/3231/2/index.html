            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all...<br><br>The 2 1/2 years of NS taught me many things, like living together with other guys and tolerating all their habits, be they good or bad. I sort of agree with raymone, in that there are certain things that cannot be learnt in our everyday smooth-flowing lives. I guess a person's true character shows when the whole bunch of guys are being stressed till breaking point, and sometimes even further. That time, you will see maybe the popular guy trying to wriggle his way out of doing things, and the most hated guy in the platoon encouraging the rest to go on.<br><br>I think I was considered one of the siao on guys when in BMT at 40 SAR, back in 1995. Of all the luck, I had to be posted to Bravo Coy, the most siong one. Really trained hard, even wanted to sign on. But luckily, I didn't get into OCS, so I didn't. After becoming a sergeant, went to School of Armour, became an instructor and got first contact with office politics. Imagine, my head of department can tell OC everything can do, but once return to office begin to say what f-ed up ideas OC had. That was what eventually disillusioned me about the army.<br><br>Well, this is what I have to say about my experience. Hope it prepares you for the road ahead, Jack...<br><br>Cheers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jack...<br><br>Trust me once you're in NS, you'll think NS is the most siong thing you can go thru in your life... but muscles and fitness isn't everything about NS  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>You'll make alot of friends that you'll continue to meet and catch up with, and these people are who you have to see for your 13 yr ICT or till you're 40 or 50...<br><br>Stuff you'll never get to try or have to pay huge $$$ to have a go in civilian life : airborne, heli-repelling, cliff repelling, a trip around S'pore on a RSNavy Petrol Vessel, high obstacle course (and i mean HIGH!) etc etc... used to think all these are "keh zhua", but now it's just sweet memories.<br><br>Oh yea, back in NS, the service side pple always complain to combat side guys that they would rather be doing something more exciting, BUT the combat side guys envy the hell out of clerks and storemen.

            <div class='col-md body'>Gambler,<br><br>Again, I wouldn't want to look it that way, hence I tend to disagree again. Sure, positive outlook in life is good. But if you immdiately say that it is a waste of time. Okay, think about this: Do you think that you are able to form that kind of bonding with your NS pals like if you were working earning your $1000 big bucks? Erm... I doubt it.. in the working life, a lot of politics are involved. I am not saying that NS does not have politics at all, I merely pointing out that when you are suffering in NS, duting missions and exercises, you have your FRIENDS who suffer with you, together you can trust them and they can trust you. I don't belong to any of gangsters' gang where a promise is a promise, but I learnt a lot of that kind of things in the NS. Can you safely say that if you are working you will definitley have friends who will "cover your backside"? Maybe you may not realize now, but NS has definitely brought a lot of maturity to the youths-turned-adults males in Singapore. Now I am in the university, I find that most girls can tend to be a bit "blur", of course there are exceptions, like some guys get out of NS still blur. And I feel that some girls are very innocent. Luckily there are nice guys around who show them the ropes, else when they get into the real world, they will get eaten! So who is to teach the guys that kind of shit?<br>I definitely agree that 2 1/2 yrs is way to long... 1 1/2 year I feel is just nice. Waste of time? Maybe idling on the computer, maybe going to JC or maybe even writing mails like this are a waste of time... but everything anyone does, there is a certain value to it, it is a matter of perception. I do not regret going to NS and serving my time for the country, I do not regret making the friends I have made in the Army. I do not regret feeling cold after night river-crossing. Maybe all these will get me when I really old, but since life is short, enjoy the situation and instead perhaps lamenting about it like I'm doing, we should cherish what is past and make better of the future.<br><br>The hole spews more air with dust.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Oh yes, Airhole, I agree with you, of course....<br><br>That there are moments to cherish in NS,<br>That there are trust worthy pals and friends you met in NS,<br>That those pals will watch your back and you will watch theirs,<br>That your bonds become stronger after all the suffering together you all went through,<br>That ...<br><br>I myself smile when think of some good times and terok time, but I still curse and swear on them, although we have all went through them save and sound.<br><br>And when come to think about it, I do think that friends made in army are still not as good as friends in poly. And friends in poly are not as good as friends in sec school. But friends made in army are certainly better than friends made in work life, and believe me, I have been long enough working.<br><br>I think the basis of making friends depend on sincerity and honesty, of course, "click" must be in the picture also. It's not possible to have friends as good as buddies in work, only much difficult and much less successful rate. I think your point is that because of all the politics and back-stabbing out there, trues friends tends to be much more difficult to get. That I still agree.<br><br>But I would still insist that army wasted most of our time. Although not totally wasted, but about 80% wasted. Ever heard of "Rush to wait, and wait to rush"?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm still serving NS, and i've had the priveledge of being on BOTH the combat AND service sides for half of my NS each.<br><br>I'd like to say that even now, I think that i've learnt more from NS than I ever did all my 12 years for formal study. Not academically, of course, but i've grown the most as a person during these almost 2 years and i'm eternally thankful for NS.<br><br>The combat side is physically tough but extremely rewarding. There's true friendship, camaraderie, bonding, shared experiences. On the service side, you sit around and grow a belly, maybe even go home everyday, but your friendships are never REALLY tested, your "ally" will stab you in the back without blinking, everyone looks out for themselves only, you're frustrated and just wanna go back to the combat side, even as a rifleman.<br><br>NS isn't about whether we think our homeland can be defended when some superpower bears down on us with a salvo of nukes - it's about what i've seen of the combat side - loyalty, comradeship, true friendship that is willing to support and sacrifice for what we believe in - the Sovereignity of our Republic. It's not that we have a 2% chance of winning a war or not, it's that we have 100% commitment to win it. THEN we WILL win. When Vietnam broke out, who do you think people placed their bets on? But it was their indomitable will and unity that held the country through (ideals aside).<br><br>All you shiteating bastards who think like Himura Kenshin had better listen up - get loyal or get the hell out of my homeland, since you don't seem to care a hoot about it. Move to Hong Kong or something, where you'll learn the true meaning of selfishness and watching your back all the time. If you stay on, i'll declare a 'cleansing' of disloyal elements and shoot you in the back when the war starts, or rather, put a bomb on your plane when you try to flee. A big "F" to all of you.<br><br>Gambler - that 80% of the time spent waiting to rush is REALLY wasted if you hadn't learnt PATIENCE.

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh yeah guys! And tks for saying wat is to be said most Grail.<br><br>You know what? I not even in NS yet. I going in on Dec lah.<br>I have this big belly that juts out when I wear a tight-fitting tee. I run 1.6 km I feel like dying. I can only do one pull-up when I use the over-arm method. My ass is big, my belly bigger, and if excercise too hard Lim Bei get cramp.I know I sure suffer in NS.Pes B somemore....<br>but I tell you if there's a war I'll drag all my fats there and blast anybody who dares to harm my homeland! Maybe I can throw a grenade before I get shot down, maybe I can carry a grenade over the enemy lines and then kamikaze, or maybe I can throw myself over a grenade and absorb shrapnel so the fitter ones will survive and continue fighting...<br><br>But if I run and don't defend my country and it falls, then where will I go without my home? My friends? My family? My love? No place like home lah. Rather die fighting for what I hold, than run like a goddam selfish coward and still lose everything in the end. Including my pride and honour.<br><br>So that guy out there whith that japanese name izzit? Kenshin or something? Go screw yourself with your own dick cos you stink like  the pus from a bloody pimple in the anus of a camel infected with leprosy.<br><br>But Grail you wrong. We still need people like him to sharpen our knives and practice bayonets on.<br><br>I think I go have ice-cream now. he made me mad.

            <div class='col-md body'>I am going for NS on 26th Jan. Well, i think ns would be a whole new experience for me.perhaps i dun really look forward to the tough physical training, but i do look forward to ns in some ways.At least i can take a break from books and results for some time.Frankly speaking, i do hope to get into OCS.Anyway, all the best to those who are going for NS after their As, and good luck for the As !<br></div>
