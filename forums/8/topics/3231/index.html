            <div class='col-md body'>Did I hear someone saying about wanting to go through hard training and all that stuff?<br><br>Maybe you should pose yourself a few questions first:<br>1) Do you exercise/work out regularly on your own?<br><br>2) How often to you exercise?<br><br>3) When was the last time you exercised?<br><br>If you do workout regularly, then good for you, NS should be a breeze. If you're counting on NS to get you trim and fit, well.. you will eventually... but you'll not enjoy it.<br><br>Besides, once you are pass your BMT and courses there won't be much emphasis on physical training. Once you are nearing your ORD, it gets worse, inactivity compounded with frequent canteen breaks makes you put on more than you have lost in BMT.<br><br>Oh.. well.. just enjoy yourself!<br>I didn't but hope you will.</div>

So during those times you find that on the weekends you're pretty much free, don't have a care in your head. Once you're outta camp, you can really enjoy till siao..

            <div class='col-md body'>Before you think of ways to "keng" yourself out of service, you must remember that even if you are downgraded, you still have to serve for 2 or 2.5 years. So do you wanna be a clerk for 2.5 years???<br><br>Being a lobo for such a long time is quite boring not to mention the extra belly you are going to gain after being lobo for so long... Like it or not, but NS would probably be the best time for unfit people(like me) to get into their best shape. Like Enigma said, you probably won't enjoy it becoz all that "extra" excercise comes from tekaning.<br><br>NS is fun but at the same time it can be quite terok.... You get your share of weird section mates, chow keng sergeants, siao on officers, f-ed up OCs, etc.... Its like a jungle in there... Enjoy it while you can and "keng" when you have to.

            <div class='col-md body'>Ha! Jack, now you are getting a bit smarter.<br><br>"Keng" is not a good way to avaoid NS totally, like what EcK mentioned. You rather build up a correct concept before you enter NS or else, they will build that for you. Believe me, it's not good. I've been a BMT instructor before (for only 3 months) and I know exactly how to wake up a recruit's idea.<br><br>Well, frankly speaking, NS can be fun ONLY after ORD when you think of all those terok time and those siong time. It's definitely not fun while you are going through, like when you are walking 50 km with full battle order, plus a GPMG.<br><br>So adjust yourself, enjoy and make the full out of it!<br><br>ps. maybe you could post another forum article after your 2.5 yrs service and tell us about your feelings!

I became some sort of a company line admin clerk after the mono-intake ORDed in December last year. And while you aren't physically tortured being a clerk, it is a lot more stressful mentally.

I think it's really pointless, although perhaps it's okay if you're gonna do that for a couple of months. But being a clerk for 2.5 yrs is really SHIT...

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, you're both right actually. Sometimes I do think being a clerk is much more torturing than combat soldier. You know, at least in the unit, when you suffer, you know your whole section/platoon is suffering with you. You'll tell yourself, if they can do it, so can I! But for clerks, if you get shit, it's all yours, no ones gonna share it with you. You'll just have to go down with all those shit on your back, hoping someday, it'll just clear up by itself. Never happens though. They just keep coming... argh...<br><br>I had one year of it and requested for overseas posting. Enough is enough. I just can't take the mental pressure no more. Went to Thailand for half a year and had a change of environment. It's not too bad actually, just like staying in-camp. But much less pressure. But kindda missed home after being away for so long (some stayed for almost their whole of their NSF life over there mind you).<br><br>Then when I returned, back to the shit again. Same place, same job, wrong time (The most stressful time). Tahan for another half year and finally disrupted. phew... thanks for listening though. he he he...<br><br>Note: To all clerks who feel like shit in your unit, maybe you can try requesting for overseas posting. But you can forget about Taiwan. You'd probably have ORDed by the time your turn comes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey! why are u ppl so negative towards jackchen?? okie, I agree that it is a bit long.. is it a waste of time?? I don't really think so. I feel that NS did teach me a lot of stuff... stuff like appreciating of friends, family and most importantly time.<br>People have told me that it was an utter waste of time.. I think they fail to see the value of what could be learnt in an environment like NS. eg. I learnt how to communicate better with peers and superiors. I also learnt that all relationships come and go. Sure, u say that I can learn that elsewhere.. but did you learn? that is the question.<br>Again, I'll like to say that NS is not a total waste of time. I learnt much. I learnt who are the real workers.. who are the slackers.. how to identify them and how to get the rest to start working... stuff like that you pay with your own money and time to learn.. but in NS it is only your time.<br><br>All in all, I say that many people fail to see what can be learnt, because they just blatantly want to say that NS is a bloody waste of time. Maybe I'm a patriot, maybe I am just deceiving myself. But sometimes you have to look the other way. Remember, everytime you fail, you learn something. Everytime a relationship dwindles, you learn something.<br><br>jus my 2 cents worth.<br><br>airhole</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi... 1st posting to this forum...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>NS? Call me a "seow nang" if you want, but I sort of miss my NS days compared to my current NTU life...<br><br>Back in NS you get to switch off your brains for 2 1/2 yrs after JC/poly... even if you were an officer or specialist, the level of thinking required just does not beat that of a student's or professional's.<br><br>Before any1 mistaken me for a "kengster" or a downgrader in NS, let me assure you that I'm not. I was a scout by vocation, and IMHO that's the 3rd most siong vocation you can kena in the army, after the commandos and the guardsmen. Land, air and sea, I've done everything thinkable less airborne and heli-repelling.<br><br>Those were the days, but then again, the grass is always greener on the other side. Back in my NS days, I thought that JC life was better... during my JC days, secondary skool seems like a breeze... during seconday skool days, primary skool blah blah blah... u get my point...<br><br>Even within your 2 1/2 yrs, you'll experience the same thing. BMT seems the most siong thing you've ever gone thru, but after I entered SISPEC, I missed my good 'ol BMT days... and in my unit, SISPEC seemed like heaven.<br><br>Furthermore, now SAF is macham WELFARE army... from the commercialized cookhouse to the lifts in BMTC (Tekong), sponge padding SBOs to the new SAR 21s... army daze now was only a shadow of its past (And we're talking about only1 to 2 yrs ago when your veggies had sand and rice tasted like meatballs).<br><br>Therefore, wherever you are doing now be it student, NS etc, treasure it although it may seem siong or boring, coz once you cross the fence to the greener side, the grass there will die.<br><br>rgds<br><br>raymone  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yap, NS is not a total waste of time, but still waste of time.<br><br>Some people may like hanging around without using their brain, just let them be. Some people may like to go through hard training and become fit, just let them be. You must learn to get the best out of it, that I totally agree, since you've got no other choice, right?<br><br>So, people would rather waste the 2.5 years of their best time in their life to ... em ... learn to communicate with peers and superior ... and getting a pay of ... WHAT ? 400 dollars per month? You've got to be kidding ! I can earn the least 1000 per month in the society and at the same time learning better communication skills. Can't imagine myself working in the society telling my subordinates: "Why do you make such a silly mistake, you see the bus stop there, touch that and come back ....."<br><br>But, if you are arguing on the ground that we must "SERVE and PROTECT" our country for they have provided us with educations and blah blah blah, then my hand are up! That's why my first message indicates that there is this need for a country to have a army, to be able to protect itself.<br><br>I don't mean to be personal, but,<br><br>To Airhole,<br><br>You learn to look at things from other side, that good. So look at the other side. If you are making progress in your career within that golden 2.5 yrs, you could have been ... somebody ... in 2.5 yrs earlier.<br><br>To Raymone,<br><br>If you want to switch off your brain, there are many ways of doing it. And correct me if I am wrong, you miss out Special Operation Force (SOF) and Snippers, they could be as siong as commandos or guards, or even more.<br><br>Cheers ...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>U must be joking about being enthusiastic abt NS. The greatest mistake of singapore was to ever create it cos of the sake of having it's own defence force.<br><br>If u were to realise (after u get enlisted), Singapore doesn't have a 4 star general, which is a FULL general, it only has a 1/2 gen. Which goes to show how small Singapore's defence force is.<br><br>Day after day...all they do is show what they are doing and inventing in the army where in fact, i doubt anyone would want to def. singapore when the need arrives.<br><br>I know it, cos i'm in it<br>Crap</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Eh Mr Kenshin, Singapore's your home with all your friends and family here so ya not gonna defend it in a time of need? While I agree with the fact that the Singapore army's role is quite cosmetic but it doesn't mean that people aren't willing to lay down their lives.<br><br>Maybe not for the country, but at least for their friends and family that they hold so dear to their hearts<br><br>------------------<br>Why?

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Gambler...<br><br>Yea I agree that switching off one's brains can be done anywhere. But I think you missed my point. One hardly gets to switch off his brain in school or in society... the inspiration factor lah  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I believe that SOF is a fraction of the commandos? And to be exact, I was in BRC, and the snipers are the 5th platoon in my company out of 5 platoons. I have no idea how come snipers are placed under the same command as the recce guys....<br><br>rgds<br><br>ray</div>
