            <div class='col-md body'>From The New Paper:<br>================================================<br>He deals with Chinese nationals but says...<br>I never needed Chinese in my work<br>On 26 Dec, we ran a report on whether not knowing Mandarin can cost you a job. Readers respond<br>By Shree Ann Mathavan<br><br>December 30, 2005<br><br>MR ALVIN Ho (right), 40, is a business development manager in an IT company. He failed his Mandarin in school.<br><br>Mr Alvin Ho.<br>But he doesn't have to use Chinese at work.<br><br>The Chinese nationals he deals with usually understand English.<br><br>'Unless the company intends to send a successful job applicant to China for an extended working stint of three to six months or longer, I would say there is probably no need to understand Chinese while working in Singapore.'<br><br>He added that many Chinese want to learn to speak English as they know it is the only way to improve their grasp of this international language of commerce.<br><br>Mr Ho was among many readers, both Chinese and non-Chinese, who responded to The New Paper's 26 Dec report, I Put Bosses To The Test.<br><br>The gist of it: Do job advertisements which mention Mandarin skills as a requirement discriminate against non-Chinese Singaporeans looking for work?<br><br>The New Paper sent me, a non-Chinese, to 'test the waters' by applying for jobs which had Mandarin as a requirement.<br><br>TOUCHED A RAW NERVE<br><br>Reporter Shree Ann (left), asking Ms Cynthia Yeo, manager of a travel agency, whether knowledge of Mandarin was a job requirement, for her Boxing Day report.<br>We decided to do the story after letters on job discrimination appeared in the press.<br><br>This was followed by several political and community leaders, among them Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and labour chief Lim Boon Heng, cautioning employers not to use Mandarin to discriminate against applicants if the job did not require such language skills.<br><br>For a few readers, the subject touched a raw nerve.<br><br>One thing was clear: Whatever stand they took, no one was sitting on the fence.<br><br>Some non-Chinese readers wrote in with examples of how race was involved when some firms hire workers.<br><br>Ms Kamaleswari Balakrishnan, 29, who can speak Mandarin, has been looking for a clerical job for the past six months.<br><br>She said administrative work involved mainly English, yet the employers asked her if she was Chinese and rejected her when she said no.<br><br>She wrote: 'What potential employers ask is: 'Are you Chinese?' They fail to see my skills and potential for the job.<br><br>'I have told many employers I can speak Mandarin, and I have even been put to the test. But, eventually, they wanted a Chinese, as in race, not someone who can speak the language.'<br><br>Another reader, Ms Niza Hamzah, who has had a similar experience, said: 'We live in a multi-racial society where English is important.'<br><br>Other readers shared their positive experience in predominantly Chinese workplaces.<br><br>One of them, Mr Muhammad Putra, 17, a graphics designer at Pearl Centre who often designs and prints materials in Chinese, which he does not understand. His customers, mainly Chinese nationals, have helped him.<br><br>'For example, they were willing to write down both the Chinese character and its hanyu pinyin pronunciation to help me type out the characters.'<br><br>He said he was lucky that his employers looked at his abilities, not his race.<br><br>A few said some bosses were justified in looking for Chinese speakers for certain jobs.<br><br>Mr Tan Ying, 61, a retiree, wrote: 'Some bosses really need to employ someone who can speak a little Chinese so that they can please their Chinese customers, especially those from Hong Kong, Taiwan or China.'<br><br>'It is easier to clinch business contracts.'<br><br>Mr Koh Juan Kiat, 53, from the String not found, STYL = STYL.INL, PC = 3B33 Singapore National Employers Federation, said that mentioning language abilities in ads are 'legitimate requirements for the job'.<br><br>'Language abilities like English, Mandarin, Malay, Japanese, Korean to handle customers, or for developing businesses in specific countries are business requirements.'<br><br>Madam Halimah Yacob, 51, NTUC assistant secretary-general, said recently that when bosses ask for knowledge of Mandarin in jobs that do not require it, people can become resentful and view the requirement as discriminatory.<br><br>EDUCATE EMPLOYERS<br><br>On employers who discriminate based on race, she said publicising such cases can help correct the situation.<br><br>'We need to educate employers that all forms of discrimination, whether on the basis of race, religion, gender, or age is bad for business as it deprives them of the best person for the job,' she said.<br><br>Madam Halimah added that racial discrimination was not a major problem in Singapore.<br><br></div>
