            <div class='col-md body'>As an unemployed angmoh, my personal favorite is "Singaporean Only can apply"...<br><br>MYTH #1<br>Ang Mohs want to be paid LOTS of money.<br><br>FACT<br>Individuals are unique. The Ministry of Manpower requires, by law, a minimum of SG$2500 per month to be paid to those applying for Employment Pass. Individuals are different &amp; unique, not everyone expects or wants the big money &amp; package, etc.<br><br>MYTH #2<br>Ang mohs "work" here. They were transferred here by their previous company getting lots of package, and they want my position just as an opportunity to stay in asia or be with their spg girlfriend.<br><br>FACT<br>Individuals are unique. For example, I came here as a tourist - I liked it and decided to stay - not because of "the girls" like everyone says to me, and not because of a job offer. My first job paid me the bare minimum + nothing.<br><br>If someone has their family, friends, pets, clubs &amp; organizations, etc., here, then they "live" here, they do not "work" here. And some of us, like myself, am trying to get a PR, to make this our new home, and to be accepted, but without an Employment Pass or jumping into marriage, there is no way to do that.<br><br>Not all of us go for the spg (even if I wanted to, I am too poor anyway). The ones who do go for spg seems like they'd be great for Sales <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> (again, not me) - but I wouldn't trust that type of mentality in normal jobs anyway in any country...<br><br>MYTH #3<br>Ang Mohs will leave the job anytime; they hear about a better offer - they leave. Something happens, they leave country. etc. etc.<br><br>FACT<br>Individuals are unique. A legally-binding contract at hiring on will solve those worries. Personally, with the unstable job-situation around the world, I would prefer long-term career growth within a company = stability...<br><br>MYTH #4<br>If foreigner, must have "Employment Pass or Work Permit to be considered for this position".<br><br>FACT<br>Individuals are unique. This is another way of saying "no ang mohs". Why? Because the above statement is ridiculous. One can not "have" an employment pass or work permit if they are not working. HR people know this...(see #4 for more info.)<br><br>MYTH #5<br>If they need E.P. (Employment Pass) - wah! too difficult leh - cannot be bothered....<br><br>FACT<br>Individuals are unique. When a company decideds they want to hire an individual, and they make an offer and the individual accepts. Then the individual fills out some questions on a form, and the company fills in some questions on the same form. The individual submits this form to the Ministry of Manpower, and pays them a fee that is below SG$100. Upon approval, the individual begins work.<br><br>This is a shorter &amp; easier process than dealing with CPF, taxes, etc, etc.<br>The company does not have to pay taxes on individual. The company does not have to pay CPF. The company does not have to pay 13th month.<br><br>MYTH #6<br>Ang mohs are difficult to get along with &amp; have no language skills.<br><br>FACT<br>Individuals are unique. If the individual is a cocky rude butthead, then of course that is a problem - even companies in his own country won't like that (except maybe used car sales  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ) !<br>There are many ang mohs here that do speak mandarin. There are those who do not, but would be happy to take courses.<br><br>Personally, if I had income, I'm wanting to learn mandarin proficiently, and I also want to learn Hokkien, but that one difficult to find teacher (someone needs to take the entrepreneurial spirit on this one...I am thinking they just might have a monopoly on the market and a kick-a$$ client base).<br><br>MYTH #7<br>Ang mohs are so high qualified - why would they be interested in my open position or company?<br><br>FACT<br>Individuals are unique. Qualifications depend upon individual, and where they are from. Every position and every company has potential - I shined shoes and washed dishes for 4 years; microsoft started in a garage, hewlett-packard started in a barn, yahoo started in a dorm room, etc...<br><br>Qualifications?<br>If the ang moh is from the usa, like myself, he might not have. In the usa life is different in general, and we value skills &amp; experience over paper. Some individuals can not pay the high costs of universities, some have to work to support dying parents, some don't fall into the proper category to receive loans from the govt., and some have all of the above troubles.<br>How about for the fellow who is in all the above, and yet finds ways to educate himself, and gets the needed skills, experience and more on his own? To me, this shows extreme work-ethic, creativity, persistence, etc. - all the things that I'd want for my team. I am not talking about making an offer to garun guni man w/o skillz here...<br><br>Ever hear of Microsoft? Mr. Gates never finished university. Yeah, but any others? Yep - The chief executive of the Chicago Stock Exchange, former chairman of Merrill Lynch, former head of New York Stock Exchange, founder of Dell (yes, the computer company), chief executive of Oracle, founder of Gateway, Ted Turner - owner of CNN, AOL (and a LOT of other companies), president of ABC Entertainment, former managing director of Korn/Ferry International, Steve Jobs of Apple, and many others.<br><br>CONCLUSION<br>I know these are myths. I know there are the facts that refute the myths. I know that there is a common mind-set and this will not change anything, regardless of logic. I know many ang mohs here will continue to make all ang mohs look bad.<br><br>However, all I can say is...Individuals are unique....<br>And oh yeah....Gimme a job, dammit!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

In the West, they may not ads in the newspaper about color, race and religion. But the moment you appear before them, they would pass you on. As I said many countries, esp the western countries may not do it overtly but it is subtle and it is there. So long as diff and prejudice in human exists, discrimination too will exist. No form of govt legislation or law can completely eredicate it.<br><br></div>

In the West, they may not ads in the newspaper about color, race and religion. But the moment you appear before them, they would pass you on. As I said many countries, esp the western countries may not do it overtly but it is subtle and it is there. So long as diff and prejudice in human exists, discrimination too will exist.
