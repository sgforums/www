            <div class='col-md body'>Worm: u were one of the most popular person in this forum wat... so u should understand that it is not keyi's fault that people reply mainly to her post... maybe u are jealous that u no longer have that attention since the focus is now on keyi, thats juz an example, no offence intended... from our argument post, u can see that alot of people care about u and if i remember correctly, maestro was there for u too... it does not mean pple dun care about u if they did not reply... maybe they dun noe u r talking to them or maybe they did not even see the post... maybe its because we never post as frequently or appear as frequently at outings thats y we are gradually left behind... even Dakar who is one of the longest around sometimes no reply... life is like tat... we have to learn to accept it if not we are juz making life miserable for ourselves... aniway... juz drop in to say hello... glad to see that u r still bursting with youth and energy  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
