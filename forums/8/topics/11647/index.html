            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Crysania <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>Well for D&amp;D, a nice and *CHEAP* way to stand out is to geta vintage dress, either from ur parents/relatives/friends etc,it usually looks very different from the spaghetti-strapped formals from celia Loe and that shop in taka(i forgot the name).<br><br>I've been to quite a few, so I'll just list some of the stuff I've worn (which pple complimented me on).<br><br>1.Dress from Celia Loe...don't do this one UNLESS u don't mind someone else coming in the same outfit. It will set u back abt 300.<br><br>2.Vintage formal outfit from Mom, *free* Yay!<br><br>3.A square sequinned top in fuschia from Chinatown,($40), and a white long slightly puffy skirt with tulle underneath from Plaza Singapura ($30).<br><br>4.Mom's silk cheaongsam altered down to my size... cost me abt 20+ in alterations. (cheaper than making one!!)<br><br>5.Black spaghetti top with diamond straps ($50), and a long ballgown skirt( $100) from Ooh La La! in Plaza Singapura.<br><br>6.Long dress made in Holland Village by Shanny Dressmakers...approx 100+.Forgot exact amt.took abt 2-3 weeks..<br><br>7. Vintage Victorian long dress at $100 from overseas vintage shop...u might find nice stuff from 'The Vintage Shop' in Plaza Sing/Pacific Plaza. Be prepared to spend at least 200 on a branded dress.<br><br>OK. Now abt MAKEUP <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>If ur on a lower budget, URBAN DECAY does makeovers for abt $30. (BUGIS). You have to make an appointment at least a week in advance.<br><br>If ur going to Splurge, go to Andy Lee's Beauty Image in Wheelock. It's abt $120 for makeup. Pricey, but he is very very good <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>HAIR<br><br>Try Madgelene @ Soda Hairdressing in Hollang Village. She's the owner, and she gave me a fantastic hairdo for my prom for less than 50. I forgot how much exactly. Andy Lee even asked who had done my hair...so she's pretty good <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Splurge: Salon d Orient/Mahogany/ or of course, Passion. depends who u get at these places, they;re usually very good too, but u got to check what type of hairstyle u want first, e.g up/down, half-half, curls? straight, cornrows/braids, crimped...etc.<br><br>And rem to bring whatever stuff u wan to put in your hair, e.g. clips, hairbands, flowers...etc.<br><br>Hope this Helps Crysania, and Have a wonderful Prom <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>aRi  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yoozzz<br><br>My DnD ended on the 4th, hmmmm i find that dresses from Daniel Yan very nice, and at a reasonable price also, range between 99- 200++<br><br>As for hair do, i did mine at Reds as its near my house, try to find one that is near to your house so that when you go home you wouldn't mess up your hair.<br><br>Its good to have a backup plan in case you come home looking like a poodle, thus never plan to go to the prom straight after you visited the salon.<br><br>Hope its helps  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>Enjoy  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>The  greatest regrets in our lives are the risks we did not take. If you<br>think  something will make you happy, go for it. Remember that we pass this way only  once.<br>Bottomline :<br>Time don't wait. If you think you might have found the  right one, treasure him/her. Don't let he/she go away. Don't let fear hold you  back.<br>Give it a try else you might regret later... No one other than  yourself<br>knows what can truly make you  happy.</div>
