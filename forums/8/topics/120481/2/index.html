            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ShrodingersCat:</div><div class="quote_body">The relationship between a teacher and a student is very different from the relationship between a police and a thief! For one thing, the thief don't come to the police if they've got problems, hoping the police will solve things for them. The police doesn't act as mentor, confidante, friend, and ultimately, teacher.<br><br>It is not a 'boss and employee' relationship, or simply a relationship between colleagues where work and 'outside' can be separated.<br><br>i think... for a teacher it is very different<br><br>for many teachers, they will understand that there is no<br>'outside the job' Students see the teacher as a mentor, whether during 'working hours' or 'outside'. We are not talking about uni students here but secondary school kids!<br><br>If a teacher cannot practise restraint and decorum, how can he command respect? Part of maturity is not just knowing What to do and What not to do, but WHEN you should do What.<br><br>My brother met his gf when they were both 15. Both decided that becos of O levels, they will remain friends, but not proceed with dating until at least their O levels is over. They both did very well for their Os and now.. almost 10 years down the road, they are still together. If a 15 yr old can decide that they should concentrate on school, and talk about 'love' later, why not a 40 year old man? ESPECIALLY if he is a teacher and should focus on her academic and social growth!<br><br>Come on, the girl is 16. How many mid 25 year olds and older here can claim that they know what they want when they are 16? She may think she is mature, but i think life still have a lot in store for her.<br><br>The guy is 40! He should know better. Oh i just read your post again. Yeah I guess you are right. it is obvious that he can't make the right decisions despite his age. So yeah.. he should know better (regardless of his age)<br></div></blockquote>The fine line of life is drawn by human. If a student approaches a teacher outside school time for school work, it can be considered as education, and that should be purely based on it. However if a student approaches a teacher outside school time as a friendly gesture, or vice versa, they have the rights to turn down each other. Thus, if anything develops from there, nothing is wrong.<br><br>We must understand that their lives is still theirs to dictate and forcing them to accept our rules and morals are simply immature and selfish acts. Rights or wrongs determined by the majority of those who are living should not be the base of measurement for the rest.<br><br>Who do they harm in their relationship? Ask yourself this question. I think if a person who decides to bite their own tongue is very hard to restrain, so what's the point of enforcing a rule or a moral judgement on something which bears so little harm outside their lives.<br><br>Imagine the whole world restrains you from doing something you like because it was morally wrong for them, but no one is harmed in it. Tell me what is so wrong against these morals?<br><br>You can accept homosexuality, but you can't accept love between a teacher and a student? I think as long as they have done no harm to others around them during their personal affair, they should be left alone.<br><br>Thus my stand is still the same, as long as the relationship does not interfere with work or study, it should not be interfered by external influences. I laugh at you, because you're like the rest, deeply rooted to these moral values set by those before you without asking yourself the damage done. Sometimes, life is so short and certain restrictions are just plain nonsense set by people who think they are right.</div>

Imagine you're borned in a place where if you don't kill you'll die and someone tells you killing is wrong. So is trying to survive wrong too? Values are weigh differently in different places due to circumstances. And circumstances are what that affect our rules, laws and morals.<br><br>We are only human to choose what we want in life. Deprive us of it, it makes us robots, animals and tools. Are parents going to live forever to make decisions for us? I doubt so for most instances.<br><br>I want to live as a human, to make my own decisions for my life instead of being dutiful to others and live by rules of others which doesnt make any good sense since I'm not affecting their lives.<br><br>I rather follow my own set of logic than earthly laws set by human who errs as much as I do.</div>

Whether she can handle is another thing. Our society cannot accept a lot of things, but the truth is, we refuse to accept because we never opened our minds to it. You judged her life with your own ruler and you think that is right for her. You judged her ability to cope with stress with your own ruler. You judged her. I feel sad for you, because by judging her as an outsider, you're trying to rule over her life. I would feel sick if I would you, because I cannot stomach being judged by someone for something that does not even hurt them a little.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Duno the head or tail..<br><br>but then I would like to say that I dun condemn this type of r/s.  And regarding age issue..it depends on the lovers right?  Well..You can't object if your best fren decides to marry someone much older right?  Eventually, it's not you who is marrying.  I think this is really based on individual perference..age, religion, race etc etc..<br><br>What's the big deal with a teacher going steady with his student?   It's a big deal because they are in the same school, i think.  So either the student transfer school or the teacher teach in another school (if he can still be a teacher in this case) or change a job.  Just like some organizations dun allow their staff to stead with another person within that organization.  But it's unfair to order them to break up..so either one has to leave the company or they have underground r/s....</span></div>

Is it wrong for a 17-18yrs old girl to date a almost 40yrs old man? Who says they can't date? If today this girl met this teacher elsewhere, not in school, would the media and mass kick up a big fuss? Teacher and student are both humans lor, why do we have to restrict them with roles we play in everyday life? If we were to follow the rules and principles, what's the point of living? And who's the one who says that teacher and student can't date? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> </div></blockquote>If the guy is not a teacher, he wouldn't have hook up with that student. How is he able to do so unless he has ample opportunities to get close to the girl everyday? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> He is obviously abusing his rights as a teacher to get close to the student. Maybe he don't have the target in mind before he became the teacher of that particular school. But any rational-minded Singaporean males will know what sort of weird fantasy that could possibly happened if he is a teacher and teaching in a mixed school. That teacher merely took his fantasy to the next level and made it into real life fantasy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>The fact is that even in other countries like Australia, this kind of behaviour of conduct by teacher is not even tolerated by the people of Australia.<br><br>Just think...who will lose out in this relationship if it doesn't goes well? Who will suffer? The girl will always lose out and suffer in this relationship if it doesn't work out. Do we really have to wait for the situation to happen before we put a stop to it? Can we really encourage this sort of relationship to grow in Singapore based solely on what we decided?<br><br>It is not just plain about the ethnics issue over here...it is moving towards a moral issue already. Can anyone accept the situation if a step-father marries his step-daughter?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>If yes, would you also have agree if any of your friend goes to an orphanage to adopt a potential little girl as his adopted daughter, raised her until she's 18 and marries her. Throughout the years there are plenty ample opportunities to execute all his sick fantasies on that poor little girl. The girl might really be in love with his step-father after all these years of being together. If you have known about it, would you have also supported his actions because they are truely in love?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I hate sick, desperate, stupid Singaporeans who are so full of themselves all the time and thinks of nothing else in their mind except sex, sex and more sex.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Castrate all the rapist, they don't deserve any chance.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br>Instead of throwing them in jail and sentencing them, can they be thrown into a container ful of sex-starved bangalas eager to own his rapist's candy a.s.s?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

I think you don't need examples.<br><br>#2 - I laugh because I find it funny because really, anyone who thinks their set of laws applies for everyone is but some fellow who probably thinks he's god. Don't blame me, but I enjoy laughing at people who insist on moral values like they are godly, holy, saintly. If you find it personal, it is personal for you. I find it rude not to laugh at a joke whenever I see one. If you know me better, you'll consider that just a mere mild statement of how I find that line ridiculous. If I get personal I'll dig into it and insist on the stupidity. (Those who have seen me doing it before can tell you how I enjoy deploring that.)<br><br>#3 - Homosexuality is by nature wrong. Religions are against it. It defeats our natural composition as compared to a 40 year old man making out with a 16 year old. We can something claim that the homosexual individual is but an unfortunate freak incident where the male or female hormones are stronger, but how true that can be? I am not against homosexuality itself but I can't see that why someone can be for homosexuality and beats down a relationship between male and female who are sexually capable. The moral values scale tips in favour of the 40-16 yr old mentor-student more than homosexuality. Ask your old folks, see their reaction. You get what I mean.<br><br>#4 - I'm at work, not much time to be sensible to all posts.
