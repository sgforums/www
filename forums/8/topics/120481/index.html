            <div class='col-md body'>I read Liang He Wan Bao today and saw a report on teacher-student love relationship aka shi sheng lian happening in Pierce Secondary School.. Therefore.. This topic is specially dedicated to the girl and the male teach in this case.. I jus wanna say..<br><br><strong><span class="large"></span><span style="color: blue;">I SUPPORT YOU BOTH!!!! GO FOR IT!!! NO ONE SUPPORT YOU BOTH, I WILL!!!! NO ONE LISTEN TO YOU BOTH, I'LL LEND YOU BOTH A LISTENING EAR!!!! GO FOR WHAT YOU BELIEVE!!!!</span><span class="normal"></span></strong><br><br>I truly hope you both see this.. I know it's hard to carry on, but if you both believe this is true love, go for it. For the girl, maybe you're crying your heart out and no one is standing by your side, don't worry I will support you mentally. You have to be strong and study hard for your coming O level this year. If you see this and you want me to be a listener, feel free to PM me.<br><br>For the teacher, if you really love this student of yours, don't give up no matter what.. Age is not a reason not to love!! Despite your situation now, you still can pursue what you believe in. I know I'm not in a good place to say this, in fact maybe to you, I'm still a kid. But if you give up bcos you met an obstacle, you're not worth to love and be loved. So don't give up!!<br><br>GOOD LUCK TO YOU BOTH!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Love and Education are two things. If they can separate school and relationship, there's nothing wrong with it.<br><br>A person who educates for a living must remember that his responsibility is to educate students and thus show no favoritism in his work. He must remember that he sets an example for the rest to follow as the students take after him. If he's found exploiting his position for personal gains and harbours favoritism, he has failed in his work and should not be granted stay.<br><br>A student who attends lesson must see lessons as lessons, not a place to enjoy her personal relationship with her mentor. Failing in that, the student has failed to respect the mentor, and should not be granted stay.<br><br>If either subject fails to respect the thin line and crosses the wrong end frequently, they should be separated from it as they had already committed errors. Dismissal or relocation of either subject is just one of the several ways to avoid such controversies from rising again.<br><br>There is nothing wrong in falling in love, but there's something wrong when you put love above everything that you do and affect others who are around you.

And how to make themselves believe he's decent/matured when he actually mixed his pte life with work? As a teacher, his role is to nurture his students, not getting them involved in BGR. Don't forget, he's gonna teach many many students in yrs to come. For the daughter, she's not finished with sec sch yet,  &amp; here she is.. falling head over heels for her teacher.

Cannot assume simply cos he is teacher means he is decent and mature yeah?<br><br>It is extremely unprofessional for a teacher to get involved with a student. Just like it is unprofessional for counsellor/psychiatrist/ coach etc to be involved with their clients. There is a certain code of ethics in such professions, and being in a 'controlling' role, the onus is on the professional to KEEP professional.<br><br>ESPECIALLY for a teacher who is supposed to be a role model. AND it makes it worse the student is only in sec school.<br><br>I assume the teacher to be of a certain age. possibly in his mid 20s to have completed NIE and NS. SERIOUSLY speaking, hardly anyone in his mid 20s would be able to have a serious, mature relationship with a 16 year old. It's not the age gap. it is the different life phases.<br><br>The teacher deserves it. I pity the girl but really, he should know better.</div></blockquote>I beg to differ. Age does little with mentality. Yes experience means they are capable of better choices, but it plays little when it comes to making correct decisions.<br><br>I would like to state that if the relationship blossomed outside classroom, who is it to judge whether if it was a mentor-student relationship since it's outside classroom.<br><br>It's like saying a police cannot fall in love with a thief. Duties are duties, if you fail your principle duties during work then it means you're not capable of handling your duties, but we're not robots, observing rules like a thick-headed moron with no emotions. However, if the police catches the thief in a crime scene, the police must do his/her duty to apprehend the thief.<br><br>Once I was asked a question whether what age is a person capable of handling their own problems. For a person with extremely high intelligent quotient, by the age of eight, they are capable of making right decisions. Applies sparingly, not everyone is capable of handling problems early, and we shouldn't be too judgemental on their abilities based on our own rulers of measurement.<br><br>Work is work, play is play, but don't play at work and mess up your work.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>My English is getting worse...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The relationship between a teacher and a student is very different from the relationship between a police and a thief! For one thing, the thief don't come to the police if they've got problems, hoping the police will solve things for them. The police doesn't act as mentor, confidante, friend, and ultimately, teacher.<br><br>It is not a 'boss and employee' relationship, or simply a relationship between colleagues where work and 'outside' can be separated.<br><br>i think... for a teacher it is very different<br><br>for many teachers, they will understand that there is no<br>'outside the job' Students see the teacher as a mentor, whether during 'working hours' or 'outside'. We are not talking about uni students here but secondary school kids!<br><br>If a teacher cannot practise restraint and decorum, how can he command respect? Part of maturity is not just knowing What to do and What not to do, but WHEN you should do What.<br><br>My brother met his gf when they were both 15. Both decided that becos of O levels, they will remain friends, but not proceed with dating until at least their O levels is over. They both did very well for their Os and now.. almost 10 years down the road, they are still together. If a 15 yr old can decide that they should concentrate on school, and talk about 'love' later, why not a 40 year old man? ESPECIALLY if he is a teacher and should focus on her academic and social growth!<br><br>Come on, the girl is 16. How many mid 25 year olds and older here can claim that they know what they want when they are 16? She may think she is mature, but i think life still have a lot in store for her.<br><br>The guy is 40! He should know better. Oh i just read your post again. Yeah I guess you are right. it is obvious that he can't make the right decisions despite his age. So yeah.. he should know better (regardless of his age)<br></div>
