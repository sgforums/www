            <div class='col-md body'>ok. firstly, being horny, is basically wanting sex (more) often to put it bluntly. but i think you guys are confusing "HORNY" with "BOLD" here. yes, sg girls are getting bolder and bolder, we're no longer the traditional meek submissive women who stay at home to cook and get pregnant. but if you think that we're more horny, or that *guffaws* we're actually trying to turn you on by dressing up and looking gd (albeit in more daring styles) i would say.. GROW UP.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, it's great to get off that plane after several hours of flying and a long meeting with those stupid clients! Good to see u guys again.<br><br>I would disagree that SGgirls are getting hornier. Took 858 from Changi Airport to my home and saw several gals boarding the bus at Yishun. That whole gang blocked up the exit and when the bus reached Woodlands, I doubt they did it on purpose when they rubbed their boobs against my arm. Which sane girl in her right mind would rub her boobs against a complete stranger?<br><br>Probably just an accident on their part. You know, bus too crowded and u'll have to squeeze a little thru the crowd to get down, accidentally touching gals boobs in the way?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do agree that dressing does not determine if the girl wants to get attention or not...it is really more of feeling good and being confident. The way you walk and talk too shows how a person u are.That is why models get so much more attention becos of their dressing and the way they walk.<br><br>Firewire: So u are right!!(A round of applause)...hehe!...And when I am studying, I dressed casually, no make up and stuffs..like a real student. When I go partying, I dress to kill, anything from midriffs to dresses, cos U wanna have fun. But like I say I might look very "happening" but from all my posts I think most of you all knows that I am rather conservative at heart...so it goes to show that appearance is always meant to be deceiving...</div>

U can't see what the person is just by how the person dress, unless she is OVERLY exposed or somewhat,or u saw the person flirting with another guy...then I have nothing to say...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>conservstive doesn't mean that a person has to go all out and look and act conservative.  matbe they can think conservatively on subjects ranging from this to that, but their image isn't conservative.<br><br>and i must say that singaproean girls are the hardest to read ...to tell whether they are conservative type or onz type...really hard(not me hard,...ha ha)...Girls in Singapore love to dress up and do dress to kill(a term used to make men cry when they see women of astounding sexual beauty...or a term used to mean that the woman is dressed in the clothing that she thinks makes her the most attractive, maybe to herslef or to others)...<br><br>Hey, when we dress up to go clubbing or pubbing or partying, we dress up to be seen man!!!!! That's a fact!!!  Which idiot going to go to those places hiding behind the columns of the building all night....And everyone knows that everyone wants to be noticed when they go there...It's an ego thing...The penultimate showcase for normal citzens who want to compete with their peers in a friendly and highly charged atmosphere... the few times everyone dresses up in clothes that make a statement about what we think of ourselves and a comparison with what others think of themselves...Gods!!!I'm getting phylosophical about clubbing....urgh!!! :-)<br><br>So it is very possible, especially for Singaporeans who live on the threshhold between complete liberalism and old asian conservative values, to look one way and be another totally...it could mean that they aspire or would like to be what they show or that what they show is just a fashion thing...Something hip and cool...<br><br>WE have to remember that Singaporean women are bred to believe in the shopping malls.  My God!  The numbers of malls here are astounding...no wonder women are so obsessed with dressing up in new and fashionable clothes...<br><br>Like I said, for Singaporean women, you never can tell...but no matter what, they're always beautiful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>YeeeeeeHHAAWWWWWW!!!! :-)(riding my folding chair holding it with one hand and waving my pseudo cowboy cap around in a circle...)<br></div>
