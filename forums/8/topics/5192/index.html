            <div class='col-md body'>This is an experience when I was in Sec 2.<br><br>For a whole term, I get horny SG girls around me. Everyday, some girls will stroke their breasts across me, AT LEAST ONCE a day.<br><br>In the bus, (I'm seated), some girls will stand beside me and keep touching my arm, with their you-know-what.<br><br>And also, when I'm standing, you have to hold on to a seat's handle right? The girl standing beside me will face me, and she'll move towards me and their breasts will come in contact with the arm which I use to hold the handle.<br>There was once, this gal, maybe sec 1 or 2, guess what she did. She did the same like other girls, faced me and moved towards me. But other girls is like, they just come in contact and move away a little. This little chilli is really bold. She moved forward, her breasts come in contact with me, and it STAY THERE!<br><br>Look, I'm not a sex pervert. I didn't touch them, they came forward and touch me!<br><br>So, please don't look at me as a sex pervert.

            <div class='col-md body'>Sigh. Sexually active girls are NOT always more horny (Is there such a word as 'hornier'?) Why do you guys insist on seeing life in such simplistic terms?!<br><br>Please read my postings on Bad Sex. I've done it before, I'm totally bored by it, and sometimes I don't want to do it EVER AGAIN. Has it occurred to you that sex is not all about simple unfettered fun. Even guys may feel some pressure living up to it too.<br><br>I also find it incredible to claim that Singapore girls in general are horny. How would you know, Mr. goodbookmarks or any of the guys here making this claim? (No offence but your name sounds like the bookworms I always avoid in school.) Have you perchance sampled at least 5 percent of the Singapore female population, which is probably around 100,000?<br><br>BTW, please don't mike up horny with sexual curiousity. Curiousity about sex doesn't automatically make you horny.<br><br>And why would anyone say Singapore girls are more horny? As compared to who? As compared to which generation?<br><br>There is no scope for constructive discussion. Only space for show-off, which cannot even be verified.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Like I said.. its just an expression.... Horny or sexually on a high... its just feeling... and feelings are based on each individual's perception.<br><br>So what they want to do with it is their own business, until it becomes other people's business.. by rubbing up on them..<br><br>I don't think that the topic is who is more horny.. Its that "Are they  hornier...."<br>I don't think so...<br><br>People are always interested in pleasure.. its how the brain works... Avoidance of pain and gravitation towards pleasure..<br><br>So how do these things work... take it as it is.<br><br>If someone comes up to take a rub... do you let him/her or do you just move away?

            <div class='col-md body'>I do feel that sg gers are getting hornier in the sense the way they wear and wat they wear. Some gals are quite daring cos they go braless without minding being seen at all. If even they do wear bra, they will surely reveal their bra strap in order to get attention of guys.........</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hahahahaha.... girls are more horny beocs of 'the way they wear and what they wear". I find this a very deluded way of thinking.<br><br>Some girls dress daringly becos they want attention. Is this the same as being horny? Trying to catch your eye doesn't mean they want to jump into bed or play footsie with you lah.<br><br>Has it also occured to you that women dress for reasons other than to please man or get more attention?! We dress to feel good, express our personalities, compete with other women plus one thousand other reasons. Dun be so ego-centric to assume that everything we do revolves around you guys.<br></div>
