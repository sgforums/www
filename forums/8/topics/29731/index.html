A deity is a God. God is immortal, is your shifu immortal? Secondly, religions teach all things good. Gambling is bad, how come she predicts 4D numbers? Is she promoting gambling? By the way, are her predictions always right?<br><br>You said you're quite impressed by her knowledge of Buddism and she can quote easily from the "Jing Shu". I'm sure you can quote your physics textbook easily too, if you read it very often. I've heard of many bogus pastors who can easily quote the bible and give sound advices, help the community, and in the end, lead their whole congregation to mass suicide.<br><br>Advice that <strong>seem</strong> sound and logical, can come from almost everybody, but don't immediately swollow whatever you're fed. Chew on it first.<br><br>About your shifu's volunteer work, my dear, i also know this guy and his wife who gave up their well paying jobs (one was working as a president of a division in a bank, and the other as a teacher) to set up a volunteer, non-profit organization. They're currently living on their own savings. But ask you ar, what did your shifu do before she became a shifu. If she's constantly doing volunteer work, what does she survive on?<br><br>Next, please tell your mum to sleep. Afterall, a God who loves her would care about her well-being. God will surely understand that your mum needs rest.<br><br>Lastly, if your gut feeling tells you smthing is wrong, then something <strong>IS</strong> wrong. Not sure how to tell / explain to you why, but your inner-being usually knows what is spiritually right / wrong. Just see if you wanna listen to it or not lor</div>

A deity is a God. God is immortal, is your shifu immortal? Secondly, religions teach all things good. Gambling is bad, how come she predicts 4D numbers? Is she promoting gambling? By the way, are her predictions always right?<br><br>You said you're quite impressed by her knowledge of Buddism and she can quote easily from the "Jing Shu". I'm sure you can quote your physics textbook easily too, if you read it very often. I've heard of many bogus pastors who can easily quote the bible and give sound advices, help the community, and in the end, lead their whole congregation to mass suicide.<br><br>Advice that <strong>seem</strong> sound and logical, can come from almost everybody, but don't immediately swollow whatever you're fed. Chew on it first.<br><br>About your shifu's volunteer work, my dear, i also know this guy and his wife who gave up their well paying jobs (one was working as a president of a division in a bank, and the other as a teacher) to set up a volunteer, non-profit organization. They're currently living on their own savings. But ask you ar, what did your shifu do before she became a shifu. If she's constantly doing volunteer work, what does she survive on?<br><br>Next, please tell your mum to sleep. Afterall, a God who loves her would care about her well-being. God will surely understand that your mum needs rest.<br><br>Lastly, if your gut feeling tells you smthing is wrong, then something <strong>IS</strong> wrong. Not sure how to tell / explain to you why, but your inner-being usually knows what is spiritually right / wrong. Just see if you wanna listen to it or not lor[/b]</blockquote>allow mi to answer your queries...  and allow u guys to decide...<br>firstly... that shifu call herself a deity because she can simply predict the future... though i dont knw the truth behind tat...<br>secondly... she don promote gambling... she's jst trying to prove wat she can do... and promote buddism...<br>thirdly... i have no idea wat she depend on for her living... but her son holds a pretty high position in an IT company...<br><br>note: i myself DON believe in her... i respect her for wat she had contribute to our society... as a human being...<br><br>Amitaba<br><br></div>

Deity means God. She's using a wrong term for herself.<br>2. If she wants to predict the future and promote buddhism, there are other ways to manifest her "powers" apart from giving out 4D, which i view as a marketing gimmick that many "buddhist promoters"  are using now.<br><br>Though i'm not a buddhist, i do feel sad for buddhists who fall into these gimmicks. Even christians also fall for certain churchs' (whom i shan't name) marketing gimmicks, but do not know it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>True buddhist teachings isn't about such stuff. Predict 4D number blah blah blah. Somehow when Buddhism has seeped into Singapore, it has been 'mixed' with Taoist teachings which emphasize on deity and gods etc etc.<br><br>Buddhism is about suffering and attaining nirvana.</div>
