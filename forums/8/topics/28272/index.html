            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all, yes I am a newbie here. So, hopefully someone can lend some advice. Recently, I was served the pink slip after having worked in the same company for the last four years. The feeling of course is not fantastic and interviews have been few and far between.<br><br>I was then thinking that maybe I'd consider upgrading myself, perhaps enhancing my skills or venturing into something else. My previous job was in sales and marketing, so I was just looking around.<br><br>Found several interesting new programmes, here are some. Maybe you guys can give me your comments.<br><br>1) Certified Practitioner of Investor Relations (CPIR) Programme conducted by APEC Business Exchange. This one looks interesting as the job scope of an investor relations practitioner seems to be quite high profile and apparently, many people I have spoken to said that investor relations is a very hot area especially in US. The <a href="http://www.airpap.com/" rel="nofollow"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: blue;">Investor Relations Association</span></span></a> that award this Certificate is part of an International network.<br><br>2) <a href="http://www.fpas.org.sg/" rel="nofollow"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: blue;">Certified Financial Planner (CFP)</span></span></a> conducted by Financial Perspectives. This one seems like an insurance agent type of job. A lot of my friends in insurance are taking this up and many people said that in future a lot of people will require a professional financial planner to help them in their investment as the government is shifting the responsibility of old-age planning to the individual.<br><br>Am quite divided about the two, but am likely to pick the CPIR Programme as the area of Investor Relations seems very interesting. I was reading this <a href="http://www.jobstreet.com.sg/career/resources/cProfiles13.htm" rel="nofollow"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: blue;">article</span></span></a> on Jobstreet's website.  Anyone has any comments, please do share it with me.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Alex</div>
