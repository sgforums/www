              <p>Cisco told me that to be a Cisco Police Officer I need to be Pes A or B. For me I am Pes C so I can only apply to be security guard.</p>

              <p>Has anybody here try to lie to them about Pes status? Did they found out that you are lieing?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am thinking of doing that. Because I feel that Cisco is not able to check with mindef on your pes status, unlike if you join SPF, SCDF etc they have the resources to check with mindef on your pes status</p>

              <p>1. You need to show your certificate of service for your NS.  So Yes.  Lying to them is no use.  They will eventually find out.  They are required to check with the Mindef that you are allowed to join them, have no issues and is bound to show up that you lied.</p>
              <p>2. If you lied to them.  It means you did a false declaration of your status.  They can either sack you (or mess with you till you finish your training then sack you.)  Charge you for false declaration in court, or close one eye and accept you thru you dont meet their criteria.</p>
              <p>3. Actually Cisco is errmmmm....staffed with actual seconded there police officers.  What makes you think they cannot link and find out about your lies?</p>

              Yes. Police need to do OT rather often as I have friends inside. It is better to get OT as compared to claiming time off. I heard the CISCO OT can hit almost 1k at times. Depending on your rank, I think after certain rank cannot claim OT or time off.
                  
                  In term of career prospect, I think police better. Just my humble view.

              <p> </p>
              <p>When did that happened?  I always see ex-NS fellas with the Pes status on their COS.  Or maybe because I only dealt with senior fellas.</p>
              <p>2. So now you are suggesting that someone on Cisco HR staff is dumb enough to have let others like you who lied pass thru their selection process.  Since this is the case, and it can be proven, I am sure Xunni will get full credit for blowing the whistle.  But if there is no such case.  Does it mean that Xunni made a slanderous remark on CISCO and is putting himself up for prosecution?</p>
              <p>Maybe Xunni is too free.  But I understand, that in Singapore.  If you made a disapraging remark on gahment services, even for privatised services.  That person can be nicked out and forever be banned from receiving any gahment services projects.</p>
              <p>Wanna bet that it can happen or not?</p>

              <p>Is it just because that you think you can remain behind a computer screen, conduct verbal vandalism, and it will reflect well upon your conscience?</p>
