            <div class='col-md body'>I think this is probably a very common mistake that shoppers made, so I think the security guards should already be very familiar with such situation and will be forgiving to 'sotong' customers who walked out without paying. I think what is crucial here is how that guy had reacted when he was confronted by the security. I believe his immediate reactions might be a "substantial" cause for the security personnel to call the police. Juz musing.</div>
