            <div class='col-md body'>1) Appeal to all the senses. Choose clothing with soft fabrics that invite the sense of touch, wear fragnances that entice the sense of smell, speak with a sensuous voice and use words that are pleasent to hear, and maintain a well-groomed appearance that is pleasing to the eye.<br><br>2) Maintain a positive outlook towards life. Who wants to be around a person who is full of gloom and doom?<br><br>3) Make the most of what you have, both physically and mentally. Emphasise your best features while downplaying undesirable traits.<br><br>4) Project confidence without intimidating others. Know and believe in yourself without being a know-it-all.<br><br>5) Be original. Your differences from others may be the very things that make you irresistible to the opposite sex. Don't be a carbon copy of someone else.<br><br>6) Learn how to make members of the opposite sex feel good about themselves by taking an interest in their lives and aspirations.<br><br>7) Leave a little something to the imagination. Don't bare all or tell all immediately. An air of mystery can create greater interest in a person.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dating Older Women<br><br><strong>EXPLORE</strong><br><br>Accept that this relationship, however serious, will be built less on common ground and more on exploring new territory. Don't expect your date to enjoy your talks about party and friends for along time, she will want to relax with a drink. That means you need to change the topic of discussion. Ask her questions about her job, her hobbies, what type of music she likes. Even though, it will not make much sense to you, look engrossed and don't be discouraged if you can't find common ground. You are after all young and you are supposed to know only what you've experienced so far. So what if she's a gardening enthusiast, but you know nothing about it? Ask her to gift you some plants for keepsake and that you promise to nurture the plants according to her gardening tips.<br><br><strong>FORGET YOUR GAMES</strong><br><br>If you end up in a relationship with an older woman, then the only time you should be playing games is when you turn on your laptop. Forget all the high school dating rules in order to make yourself look cool. The solution is simple: Just act your age and like you feel, not how you think you should according to some dating protocols you were taught by friends in college. If you feel attracted to her, tell her.<br><br>If you have the urge to call her, do it. Since an older woman is more likely to be further along in her career than you are, she may insist on paying most of the time, be comfortable about this. But do be a gentleman and offer to buy dinner.<br><br><strong>BE COOL</strong><br><br>Be prepared to handle comments. Many relationships of younger men and older women have been talked about for a long long time now, but yet such relationships does arouse a lot of curiosity. You'll have to deal with looks and remarks from friends, family, and even strangers. But if you do manage not to stumble by the comments, you'll not only cope, you'll impress your lady with your maturity and charm. If somebody can't help but glare at you and your lady for the obvious reasons, be witty and smoothly say something like, "I don't blame you for staring. She's beautiful, isn't she?"<br><br><strong>DON'T DISCUSS AGE</strong><br><br>Agreed the lady you are dating is smart, confident and mature but be certain she'll not like her age being mentioned at any given time. You know how women are touchy about their age! She might feel you are subtly reminding her of the age difference between the two of you and that could make her uncomfortable. Please, for heaven's sake avoid a comment like, "Don't we get along so well, despite our age differences". Besides, it's your personalities, not your birthday candles, that are compatible - and that's where you should concentrate. Don't you make the mistake of asking the question like, "Did your town/city have electricity when you were a little girl?"<br><br><strong>BE YOURSELF</strong><br><br>Remember, she is dating you because she likes you. She obviously had a choice of dating anyone of her age but she didn't. So don't pressure yourself to act more mature. Maybe, she's attracted to you because you are young and have a open mind. You offer spontaneity and fun.</div>
