            <div class='col-md body'>MUST DO...<br><br>1) Hold yourself upright. Think of how you'd hold yourself if you were the most confident person in the world.<br><br>2) Move slowly. Gesture slowly. Speak slowly. Blink slowly. This communicates comfort and confidence.<br><br>3) Pause often. Only respond if you choose to. Remember: You don't need to react or respond to anything that you don't want to. Women often try to push you off balance. Don't fall for it. Stay cool, and pause if you need to in order to keep your composure.<br><br>MUST NOT DO...<br><br>1) Talking too fast or too much. This communicates that you're nervous and sketchy, unless you're telling a really intresting story, that is...<br><br>2) Making nervous gestures, laughs, tics, etc. At times many guys laugh nervously after just about everything they say. This is the death of attraction. It instantly communicates insecurity.<br><br>3) Breaking eye contact. At fIrst, you need to maintain eye contact until she breaks it. This establishes at an unconscious level that you're not afraid.<br><br>CHECK THEM OUT...<br><br>Study the body language and composure of some of the world's most famous ladies' men...<br><br>- Watch Ocean's Eleven and see how Brad Pitt and George Clooney act in that movie. They are great models of attractive, composed body language.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>How to plan your first date</strong><br><br>1) Be creative. Take a little time to think it through. A three-hour date with a movie that lasts two and a half hours is not a good way to get acquainted. It's better to sit down somewhere and talk.<br><br>2) Lunch or coffee is a good start. There can be plenty of topics for discussion without having to deal with issues like: "What happened to your last relationship?"<br><br>3) Wear clothes that make you feel good. New clothes always help but if not new, be sure they're clean, pressed, and fit well or if that's not your style, be sure they fit whatever way makes you feel the most comfortable and still looking presentable.<br><br>4) Find something nice to say about your date and compliment her or him. But mean it. Don't just say it for the sake of saying<br><br>5) Etiquettes are important so thank the other person for the date. Don't complain on a first date and try and stay positive.<br><br><strong>How to go on a 'safe date'</strong><br><br>1) Meet in public places. If possible, double date or go out with a group of people.<br><br>2) Go Dutch. By paying for your portion you won't feel as if you are under any kind of obligation.<br><br>3) Don't assume just because a person claims to be religious that he's safe.<br><br>4) Use your own mode of transportation. Always have your own ride to and from a date. And leave with a full tank.<br><br>5) Avoid scheduled areas such as beaches and parks.<br><br>6) Listen to your gut. If something doesn't feel right, it probably isn't.<br><br><strong>How to have a successful date</strong><br><br>1) Always look great, whatever your income. Gorgeous hair and some lipstick and wearing rags will still turn his head. You have the advantage, you are the woman. Look your best as you could meet a potential Mr Right anywhere at any time. Never reveal information you don't have to. An enigmatic woman drives men wild.<br><br>2) Keep dates brief, but keep your man interested. Less is always more. Try and stay in shape and involve some fitness regime at a gym. However much you hate it, your Mr. Right loves your body as much as your mind.<br><br>3) Let your man pay. If he is interested, he is interested enough to ensure you eat well and get home safely in a cab.<br><br>4) Ensure you receive flowers, if he doesn't know what a florist is, dump him.<br><br>5) Never ever sleep with a guy until he has fallen for you. Sex early in your dating game plan will ruin everything. Always keep a guy waiting and never turn up easily. It is a lady's prerogative.<br><br>6) Never be available when he wants you to be. Never be at the end of a phone when he calls and always let him leave a message or two first before replying. If he is available on Tuesday, you are available on Thursday. Keep your man standing on quicksand by shifting landmarks and goal posts constantly.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Things that kill your love life<br><br><strong>The green-eyed monster</strong><br><br>Excessive jealousy or possessiveness is the leading reason behind why people break up. If you are extremely possessive about your partner, you could be sabotaging your own love life. Nobody likes their life to be controlled by someone else. If your partner starts to feel concerned by your desire to always control what he or she is doing, they might just break free. If you are the type that gets jealous easily, the next time you feel the feeling surfacing, remind yourself that it could be worse for you to indulge in your jealousy, rather than ignore it. Talk to your partner instead, and explain that your possessiveness stems from the fact that you love him/her immensely and that you are willing to work on changing.<br><br><strong>Sex</strong><br><br>If you are having sexual problems in your relationship and do not talk to your partner about your issues, it could ruin your relation. Sex is not the only thing, but then, it is a natural desire. If there are problems in this department your best bet would be to voice your feelings. If you continue to remain silent, it could lead to frustation and you might end up losing your partner.<br><br><strong>The past</strong><br><br>Let the past remain in the past, there is no point in bringing it up and allow it to affect your present. If you have issues, talk to your loved ones. If you allow these issues to build they will not only ruin your love life, but also extend to other relationships in your love life.<br><br><strong>Money problems</strong><br><br>Money can cause a lot of tension between two people who are intimate. The only way to solve money issues, is to reach middle ground. If you love shopping, limit your expenses. Similarly, the partner who likes to save should loosen his or her fist a little and learn to enjoy the money that is earned.<br><br><strong>Former lovers</strong><br><br>No one likes it if their partner still has feelings for their ex, or even an implication that their partner favours another's company. So, if you are still in touch with your ex, you need to stop it before it destroys your current relationship. If you feel that both of you are genuinely just friends with your respective exex, learn to accept that. Otherwise you both need to sit down and have a talk as to where you stand in each other's lives, so that there is no room for doubt.</div>

And no, it's not different, it's just like every other cat.<br><br>10. Dogs are better than ANY cats. Period.<br><br>11. Sunday = Sports. It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides. Let it be.<br><br>12. Shopping is not a sport.<br><br>13. Anything you wear is fine. Really.<br><br>14. You have enough clothes.<br><br>15. You have too many shoes.<br><br>16. Crying is blackmail. Use it if you must, but don't expect us to like it.<br><br>17. Your brother is an idiot, you ex-boyfriend is an idiot and your Dad probably is too.<br><br>18. Ask for what you want. Subtle hints don't work.<br><br>19. No, he doesn't know what day it is. He never will. Mark anniversaries on a calendar.<br><br>20. Yes, pissing standing up is more difficult than peeing from point blank range. We're bound to miss sometimes.<br><br>21. Most guys own two or three pairs of shoes -- What makes you think we'd be any good at choosing which pair, out of thirty, would look good with your dress?<br><br>22. Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers.<br><br>23. A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a doctor.<br><br>24. Your Mom doesn't have to be our best friend.<br><br>25. Foreign films are best left to foreigners.<br><br>26. Check you oil.<br><br>27. Don't give us 50 rules when 25 will do.<br><br>28. Don't fake it. We'd rather be ineffective than deceived.<br><br>29. It is neither in your best intrest or ours to take the quiz together.<br><br>30. Anything we said 6 or 8 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. All comments become null and void after 7 days.<br><br>31. If you don't dress like the Victoria's Secret girls, don't expect us to act like soap opera guys.<br><br>32. If something we said can be interpreted two ways, and one of the ways makes you sad and angry, we meant the other one.<br><br>33. Let us ogle. If we don't look at other women, how can we know how pretty you are?<br><br>34. You can either ask us to do something OR tell us how you want it done -- not both.<br><br>35. Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during commercials.<br><br>36. Christopher Columbus didn't need directions, and neither do we.<br><br>37. Women wearing Wonder bras and low-cut blouses lose their right to complain about having their boobs stared at.<br><br>38. Consider Golf a mini-vacation from you. We need it, just like you do.<br><br>39. Telling us that the models in the men's magazines are airbrushed makes you look jealous and petty and it's certainly not going to deter us from reading the magazine.<br><br>40. The relationship is never going to be like it was the first two months we were going out.<br><br>AND FINALLY, THE NUMBER ONE RULE:<br><br>1.
