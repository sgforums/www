            <div class='col-md body'>ITs current mushy family, heartlander-minded productions<br><br>Anyone noticed ever since channel U was set up, Mediacock has reverted to the extremely conservative format for its drama --- family theme<br>Examples: Mei Li Jia Ting, Hao Er Hao Nu 1&amp;2, Jia zai Toa Payoh, Jia Cai Wan Guan, Happy Fish 1&amp;2 etc etc<br><br>Met with the fierce competitions of imported HK serials at prime time, family-themed drama are the safest bet cause their targeted segment (The aunties, housewives) are usually the most avid supporters.<br><br>I was actually quite surprised &amp; also repulsed by this strategy of theirs.<br><br>On the contrary, some of channel U productions are quite heartening. Like the recent Yi Xin Ren ( changing lanes),though a bit Â“rawÂ” &amp; hampered by its tiny cast, the storyline &amp; theme was not bad.<br>It actually reminds me of the older ch 8 dramas, when there were themes of all kind. Successful examples was The Wisely serial ( Michael Tao &amp; Zoe Tay), Fu Man Ren Jian ( time-traveling stuff) &amp; Mo Sheng Ren ( with fat Alex Man &amp; chen liping)<br><br>A good example will be HK_TVB. Though faced with similar tough environments &amp; also complaints of recent standard dropping( compared to the 80s, 90s), they are still a class above local station.<br>Every year, their anniversary productions are shows which I rely look forward to. Last year example: They had 2 serials--- Xi Guan Da Shao ( Point of No Return) &amp; Chong Shang Yun Xiao ( Triumph in the sky). 1 consisted of mainly veteran cast, run of the mill storyline (but still engaging); the other explored the world of pilots, airport.<br><br>ThatÂ’s what I feel a station shld truly do<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by A Beautiful Mind:</div><div class="quote_body">ITs current mushy family, heartlander-minded productions<br><br>Anyone noticed ever since channel U was set up, Mediacock has reverted to the extremely conservative format for its drama --- family theme<br>Examples: Mei Li Jia Ting, Hao Er Hao Nu 1&amp;2, Jia zai Toa Payoh, Jia Cai Wan Guan, Happy Fish 1&amp;2 etc etc<br><br><span style="color: red;">It's because the gahmen's current emphasis is on family togetherness. They want to suck up to the gahmen.<br><br>I noticed that they have a serious lack of actors ever since Channel U was set up. You see the same stupid actors acting in two different shows at the same time. And all those veteran actors are suddenly out from their cobwebs and back into the business. What the hell?</span><br><br>Met with the fierce competitions of imported HK serials at prime time, family-themed drama are the safest bet cause their targeted segment (The aunties, housewives) are usually the most avid supporters.<br><br>I was actually quite surprised &amp; also repulsed by this strategy of theirs.<br><br>On the contrary, some of channel U productions are quite heartening. Like the recent Yi Xin Ren ( changing lanes),though a bit Â“rawÂ” &amp; hampered by its tiny cast, the storyline &amp; theme was not bad.<br>It actually reminds me of the older ch 8 dramas, when there were themes of all kind. Successful examples was The Wisely serial ( Michael Tao &amp; Zoe Tay), Fu Man Ren Jian ( time-traveling stuff) &amp; Mo Sheng Ren ( with fat Alex Man &amp; chen liping)<br><br>A good example will be HK_TVB. Though faced with similar tough environments &amp; also complaints of recent standard dropping( compared to the 80s, 90s), they are still a class above local station.<br>Every year, their anniversary productions are shows which I rely look forward to. Last year example: They had 2 serials--- Xi Guan Da Shao ( Point of No Return) &amp; Chong Shang Yun Xiao ( Triumph in the sky). 1 consisted of mainly veteran cast, run of the mill storyline (but still engaging); the other explored the world of pilots, airport.<br><br>ThatÂ’s what I feel a station shld truly do<br></div></blockquote>Agreed. Channel U rules!<br><br>I have a suggestion: When they merge, let the Channel U team take charge of making variety shows for Channel 8, because Channel 8's variety shows truly <strong><span class="large">SUCK</span></strong>. Why does it suck?<br><br>1) Sharon Au is in most of the variety shows. What's wrong with her? Oh, well she SUCKS. Her acting skills suck, her hosting skills suck, her attitude sucks, her speech sucks, her character sucks, and most importantly,<br><br><strong><span class="large">HER FACE SUCKS.</span></strong><br><br>And the worst part is, her face is appearing EVERYWHERE! Why the hell do people still support her? She sucks. Everytime I see her on TV, I point my middle finger and switch channels.<br><br>2) Their sense of humour is so DRY, LAME, and CLICHED. Only a 5 year old would laugh at their jokes. Ask yourself, is the variety show on Friday night FUNNY? To be honest, I'd rather watch the news than their variety shows.<br><br>3) Their variety shows are mostly <span style="text-decoration: underline;">copied</span> from Channel U. Unorignal ********. And they even have the cheek to air it! Thick skinned, shameless *******  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>4) Even after copying, their variety shows still suck.<br><br>But I have to admit, Channel 8's dramas are better. (Except for the fact that their actors are very limited.) Channel U's dramas are nice, but not interesting enough.<br><br>I am anti-Sharon Au, by the way.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
