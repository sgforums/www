They simply lack the depth of outlook to life. All i done were tried to date girls who dont even know about what it take to being intellectual and open minded. As a result they could not appreciate me. I got to know this swiss born asian girl thru the internet as frens and she flew over to SG to visit me once. I can say she beats all the local gals hands down. THis is the big difference betwween local wwomen and forengners<br><br>She could discus a wide variety of topics and stuff and interested in many things. I dont find this kind of crativity and passion among local gals . Sorry to say that. The money maker regine with its farked up education system has bred such people here. But out that aside, one needs to think and act on his own individually and not get influenced by others rite? Sorry more women in sg lack this critical thinking than men. Men are generally the same till they go to NS and expereinced that faked up regime. And after that, none could ever pull their legs again.

Sex is everywhere and accessible for us. Too easy. - This sg women must realise. Why would the guy want to marry and settle down, for sex? yes part of  it but not purely.<br><br>Personally i know of a guy who is decent and average looking but got shunned by local girls. He never went play chicken in geylang like other guys. He just wanted to find his soulmate. But soon he started going. Asked him why this change, he said he wanted to make up for all those failures in the past he had with gals and that the pros treat him like a king.</div>
