KNN.<br><br>why must wait until full moon? because science and research has proven time and time again that humans get hornier when the moon is full. no scientific explanation for this, but this works especially good for guys. after all, com'on. humans evolved from nature and are components of nature too. it's all part of evolution. remember? "men get more beastly when the moon is full".<br>also, if you ever look at the crime reports and such in other countries, like those very serious murder, rape and violence cases, most of the crimes are comitted on the night the moon is full.<br><br><blockquote>The guys here are attacking the gals without provocation at times while the gals are reasonable and understanding towards the guys temper and point of view. I'm impressed. With the gals.</blockquote>KNN......don't play cool leh. u think girls will pay attention to u just because u suck up to them meh? trying to be observant and understanding to attract girls hah?

Singaporean gals will never do such thing. I will still choose Singapore gals as my life partner. Good quality match good standard.</blockquote>smart choice lah. for me, i would rather remain single for the rest of my life than to marry those mail-order brides. someone, if i'm the PM of SG, i would fully abolish this kind of practice. don't u all think it's very disgracing and insulting to those foreign girls? they're being treated like shelf products, whereby 1 SG guy fly over there to choose from 500+ of them. see, test, judge. not happy, try another. KNN com'on lah, losers......now what age already? besides......this is SG hor, not some tribes in Indonesia or Africa leh. KNN.<br><br>SG girls, especially those who have never suffered much hardship before and those who always got maids to serve them and who used to go to those rich girls-only school are quite detestable and arrogant and u always wanna slap them to make them wake up lah, but the majority of girls here quite down-to-earth and humble one, even though they look so aloof on the outside.<br>the reason why they look rather aloof and unapproachable is that they really know how to doll up themselves, which i admire greatly. u go to Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand. the girls there you see all have no sense of dressing and dunno how to make themselves look pretty. KNN.<br>also Japan. u all everyday see Japanese porn stars think what? wha......very shiok, very gorgeous like fairies meh? u buy ticket, go to the real Japan and see the girls there. don't be disappointed until you cry or committ suicide hor. dressing and dolling-up aside, their faces and looks also quite retarded looking. u think what? big cute eyes like Ayumi ah? dream on lah.<br>thus, the SG girl specimen is still the best of the best.<br><br>western countries another issue lah, that one cannot compare too much, but if wanna compare, also can. i can analyze for you too.<br><br><blockquote>Ang Mohs really better in term of manners, finance and more romantic.</blockquote>not really lah. u must look at the world, not just SG. normally, when people mention "ang moh" in SG, they're almost always talking about expats. EXPATS.<br><br>in their native countries, real ang mohs are quite different loh. some very violent, some wanna have sex all the time.....u know lah.<br>got quite a lot also lack confidence one. u just need to see more of the world loh. also got a lot running out of jobs and being sacked and retrenched.<br>romantic? not always lah. got some very sweet and romantic one, the kind of guys that girls want.<br>but if you listen to those ang moh girls, also got a very large majority of them admit ang moh guys not romantic enough, very boring. guys all the same lah. only difference is confidence level and gentlemanliness. in this aspect, the expats here beat local guys hands down lah.<br>but in almost all countries the expats all like this. like asian expat go to US, asian expat also stand a slight edge.<br><br>good day. but not before i say......KNN!<br>nikar.</div>
