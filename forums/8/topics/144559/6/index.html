            <div class='col-md body'>This thread is amazing...<br><br>The guys here are attacking the gals without provocation at times while the gals are reasonable and understanding towards the guys temper and point of view. I'm impressed. With the gals.<br><br>Dun be fooled by my nick, I'm a guy and I understand all the arguments from the guys, no matter how incoherent. As for the arguments put forth from the gals... I must confess that I do not understand many of the points being put across.<br><br>From personal experience, I have dated around a lot and have encountered many gals. Most sg gals I dated cared very much about social status, car and the such.<br><br>1 of my ex gf was a law student. Every date was a test... Questions like "use 3 words to describe yourself", "name 5 qualities that you are proud of" and "what would you do in this scenario..." would crop up in many forms.<br><br>Whenever I did not drive, she would tell me she was tired, or did not want to meet. Sometimes I would be waiting at the void deck of her flat and she would tell me to go home as i did not drive that day.<br><br>She was also very caught up with social status. She would ask me over and over again, "I'll be a lawyer and you'll only be an engineer. What are you going to do about it?"

            <div class='col-md body'>Whenever a lady looks for a partner, they will look for someone better than them. In their mindset their men should be taller than them, financially better than them. In guys position, I believe they think the other way round. Maybe Singaporean gals expectation is high but this is because their standards is high too. I pity those men who can't win the gals standard. Why waste your time complain while you should pull up your sock. If a gals can be good in work or education, you guys can be better. You may said china girls are better, but please beware, they maybe out to con your money. Singaporean gals will never do such thing. I will still choose Singapore gals as my life partner. Good quality match good standard. Ang Mohs really better than you in term of manners, finance and more romantic. Sorry to those losers who only know how to complain. Who want you? If you are gals, do you want yourselves?</div>
