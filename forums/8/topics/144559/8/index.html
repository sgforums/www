            <div class='col-md body'>I've not read all the previous 8 pages of posts cos somehow i know what is the debate all about, so pardon me if relevances to the earlier messages are not apparent. I think the bloody problem with Singaporeans is that they are never satisfied. That is the problem when the govt has a myopic view on our local education, and that result in Singaporeans growing up to being selfish, unforgiving, and pompous people.  THe fact of the matter is THE GRASS IS ALWAYS GREENER ON THE OTHER SIDE. FACE IT, We have grown up with our local people, and when something exotic comes along, we tend to cherish them better, for its the unknown quality that gives us that added thrill to explore further, rather than something we have grown accustomed to all these years. I don't blame singaporean guys for going for demure subservient foreign ladies esp those from vietnam, thailand etc.. I mean, if that's what they want, by all means go for whatever that makes you happy. However, i cannot accept when local guys start to lambast the ladies for being materialistic, for going after money or the 5Cs and nothing else.. My question to them is " Is it wrong for them to go for somebody that will give them a better quality of life". Local guys have a problem with their own egos and they are desperately short of confidence, lack the focus in their careers, and somehow doesnt have the ability to engage in quality conversations. FOr me, there's always a group of local guys that are always complaining about Singaporean girls being very materialistic, but turn the tables and ask them, if that's the case, why dont they start focusing on the careers and be in a better position to provide, and they get tonguetied...TO cut the chase, what i'm saying is that guys in singapore should not berate the ladies for being materialistic, cos to say that they are being superficial, is like a pot calling a kettle black, cos after all, the local guys does go for looks as well, doesnt they??? As for the local ladies profiling the guys as boring and unromantic, as compared to the expatriates, i think its very unfair.. The expats come to Singapore with no concrete form of commitments.. They work then party all day long, while the local guys have to support their parents, etc... THe expats working here has a "holiday mood" and that explains why they seems more jovial, etc, but make no mistakes, they are certainly better conversationalist than most local males.. At the end of the day, choose whoever makes you happy, but stop the local bashing.. IT not only reflects badly on you youself, but also on your upbringing... PEACE OUT !!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Chief_SittingBull:</div><div class="quote_body">I've not read all the previous 8 pages of posts cos somehow i know what is the debate all about, so pardon me if relevances to the earlier messages are not apparent. I think the bloody problem with Singaporeans is that they are never satisfied. That is the problem when the govt has a myopic view on our local education, and that result in Singaporeans growing up to being selfish, unforgiving, and pompous people.  THe fact of the matter is THE GRASS IS ALWAYS GREENER ON THE OTHER SIDE. FACE IT, We have grown up with our local people, and when something exotic comes along, we tend to cherish them better, for its the unknown quality that gives us that added thrill to explore further, rather than something we have grown accustomed to all these years. I don't blame singaporean guys for going for demure subservient foreign ladies esp those from vietnam, thailand etc.. I mean, if that's what they want, by all means go for whatever that makes you happy. However, i cannot accept when local guys start to lambast the ladies for being materialistic, for going after money or the 5Cs and nothing else.. My question to them is " Is it wrong for them to go for somebody that will give them a better quality of life". Local guys have a problem with their own egos and they are desperately short of confidence, lack the focus in their careers, and somehow doesnt have the ability to engage in quality conversations. FOr me, there's always a group of local guys that are always complaining about Singaporean girls being very materialistic, but turn the tables and ask them, if that's the case, why dont they start focusing on the careers and be in a better position to provide, and they get tonguetied...TO cut the chase, what i'm saying is that guys in singapore should not berate the ladies for being materialistic, cos to say that they are being superficial, is like a pot calling a kettle black, cos after all, the local guys does go for looks as well, doesnt they??? As for the local ladies profiling the guys as boring and unromantic, as compared to the expatriates, i think its very unfair.. The expats come to Singapore with no concrete form of commitments.. They work then party all day long, while the local guys have to support their parents, etc... THe expats working here has a "holiday mood" and that explains why they seems more jovial, etc, but make no mistakes, they are certainly better conversationalist than most local males.. At the end of the day, choose whoever makes you happy, but stop the local bashing.. IT not only reflects badly on you youself, but also on your upbringing... PEACE OUT !!</div></blockquote>Good argument you have rite there!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  Cheers!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
