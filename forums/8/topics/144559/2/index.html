            <div class='col-md body'>all u sg guys here, dont waste yr time ont his sinka b|tches. I had enough bad expereinces with them in all my life staying here. During sec school these b|tches go for looks and after leaving school they go for $$. WHen u apprach them they give that faked up attitude like the most beautiful woman on earth<br><br>Wad kinda faked up attitude is that? Have u ever heard of any widespread trend where guys going for a gal's money ect?<br><br>They cry gender equality and so let them have it. Dont come find me for money lor. Since u cry gender equality, u can support yrself financially. SO why ar eru looking for an equal husband? sounds fishy rite? or do u have other ulterior motives to make him work and enjoy his money?<br><br>Now all these rounds up to 1 thing. those educated women who are financially sound are selfish, greedy and lack a sense of compassion. They want a guy to match their egoistic, superficial lives.<br><br>Anytime i would pick a humble factory worker gal who knows how to be a gal over such condemed b|tches. Call themselves practical? now ay . u are just exploitive b\tches out for someone's money.<br><br>Guys wake up and look around. Switch on yr Internet and TV and watch reality shows u can see that foreign women are better, have iniative and passion for life than thse local slats who are brainswashed by the money making regime<br><br>Let me just advice u sg women, Dont be a pros. If u want a rich guy, chances are he will want yr body. what does that make u any different from the china "FT' working in geylang?<br><br><strong>u sg women have a limited lifespan to hook your rich guy. I can gurantee chop and say after 30 , no young guy will look at u. Only old perverted ah peks who want a good time sex lure u with their money. We guys in our 20s and 30s can just look at those sec school or poly girls and hook one of them, brainwash them and sure their parents will want them to give us since we will be able to support them. Young and fresh. No old single hag living in a dream</strong></div>

People say i do talk and think more like foreigners on Tv shows ect. But all my life from 16 to now 24 i had not met a gal who can talk intelligently as women u see in foriegn shows. They simply lack the depth of outlook to life. All i done were tried to date girls who dont even know about what it take to being intellectual and open minded. As a result they could not appreciate me. I got to know this swiss born asian girl thru the internet as frens and she flew over to SG to visit me once. I can say she beats all the local gals hands down. THis is the big difference betwween local wwomen and forengners<br><br>She could discus a wide variety of topics and stuff and interested in many things. I dont find this kind of crativity and passion among local gals . Sorry to say that. The money maker regine with its farked up education system has bred such people here. But out that aside, one needs to think and act on his own individually and not get influenced by others rite? Sorry more women in sg lack this critical thinking than men. Men are generally the same till they go to NS and expereinced that faked up regime. And after that, none could ever pull their legs again. The regime knows this too....tht the anger and discontent of Sg men lingers on int heir minds long after they ORD<br><br>now they whole thing is just biting back through this society crisis<br></div>

People say i do talk and think more like foreigners on Tv shows ect. But all my life from 16 to now 24 i had not met a gal who can talk intelligently as women u see in foriegn shows. They simply lack the depth of outlook to life. All i done were tried to date girls who dont even know about what it take to being intellectual and open minded. As a result they could not appreciate me. I got to know this swiss born asian girl thru the internet as frens and she flew over to SG to visit me once. I can say she beats all the local gals hands down. THis is the big difference betwween local wwomen and forengners<br><br>She could discus a wide variety of topics and stuff and interested in many things. I dont find this kind of crativity and passion among local gals . Sorry to say that. The money maker regine with its farked up education system has bred such people here. But out that aside, one needs to think and act on his own individually and not get influenced by others rite? Sorry more women in sg lack this critical thinking than men. Men are generally the same till they go to NS and expereinced that faked up regime. And after that, none could ever pull their legs again.

I had enough bad expereinces with them in all my life staying here. During sec school these b|tches go for looks and after leaving school they go for $$. WHen u apprach them they give that faked up attitude like the most beautiful woman on earth<br><br>No. 1 &gt; If YOU want girls to respect ur gender, maybe in the first place, stop calling them names. Not all girls have faked up attitude. You just happen to meet the bad ones.<br><br>Wad kinda faked up attitude is that? Have u ever heard of any widespread trend where guys going for a gal's money ect?<br><br>No. 2&gt; Definitely not. But have you heard of a gal forking out all her money to help the man he love?<br><br>They cry gender equality and so let them have it. Dont come find me for money lor. Since u cry gender equality, u can support yrself financially. SO why ar eru looking for an equal husband? sounds fishy rite? or do u have other ulterior motives to make him work and enjoy his money?<br><br>No. 3&gt; If a girl can support herself financially, why can't she find an equal husband? Both will lead a good life. But tat doesn't mean that she can not accept a man less competent than her. If u are talking about ulterior motives here, then there's no reason why u should be talking about love/ relationship here.<br><br>Now all these rounds up to 1 thing. those educated women who are financially sound are selfish, greedy and lack a sense of compassion. They want a guy to match their egoistic, superficial lives.<br><br>No. 4&gt; Mind u again, not all educated women who are financially sound, selfish, greedy and lack of compassion. Do not discriminate.<br><br>Anytime i would pick a humble factory worker gal who knows how to be a gal over such condemed b|tches. Call themselves practical? now ay . u are just exploitive b\tches out for someone's money.<br><br>No. 5&gt; If you wld like to pick a humble factory worker gal, go ahead. No one's stopping you. Who condemned these bitches? Who named them bitches. Just who?<br><br>Guys wake up and look around. Switch on yr Internet and TV and watch reality shows u can see that foreign women are better, have iniative and passion for life than thse local slats who are brainswashed by the money making regime.<br><br>No. 6&gt; So you are basing on what you have seen on tv, to compare those ladies with Singaporean ladies? GOd, ain't u shallow?<br><br>Let me just advice u sg women, Dont be a pros. If u want a rich guy, chances are he will want yr body. what does that make u any different from the china "FT' working in geylang? ]<br><br>No. 7&gt; Then guys should wake up and stop dreaming about havin a 34-22-33 barbie size girlfriend, who just want their bodies? What's the difference here huh?<br><br>[b]u sg women have a limited lifespan to hook your rich guy. I can gurantee chop and say after 30 , no young guy will look at u. Only old perverted ah peks who want a good time sex lure u with their money. We guys in our 20s and 30s can just look at those sec school or poly girls and hook one of them, brainwash them and sure their parents will want them to give us since we will be able to support them. Young and fresh. No old single hag living in a dream</strong>[/b]</blockquote></span><br><br>No. 8&gt; No one is stopping you guys from hooking up poly or sec girls. Go ahead.  And when they start working, let's see if they would want to stick with you.<br><br>People changed. Everyone change. Complacency will only ruin more. Instead of complaining, maybe we should just do some self evaluation.<br><br>I believe there are girls out there being a bitch and all. But guys, please do not condemn the rest of those nice girls who are 'unfortunately' more educated and all, in finding a nice singaporean boyfriend/husband.<br><br>Not the girls that are making it hard to find a nice man, guys are making it hard for these girls too.<br><br></div>
