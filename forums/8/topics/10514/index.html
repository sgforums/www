            <div class='col-md body'>my fren told me abt this and i was wondering if this is the case with girls these days.<br><br>this guy really liked this girl. but she didn't like him back, tho they were quite close after a while. the thing is she came to like another guy and started being really close to him even when the first guy was around. she knows that the first guy will get jealous and upset, but yet she insists on being flirtatious with that guy when the first guy is around. i thot maybe the proper thing to do, if she cared for his feelings at all, would be to be less of a flirt with this new guy when the first guy was around. i wonder if she's just being childish, immature and spiteful cos she has really hurt the first guy's feelings. and all he did apparently was to let her know he liked her. are girls getting more spiteful these days?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well i'm sure not everyone is like her. but it's people like her that make me think twice. the way she handled things was really appalling. some more she's like 22-23 yrs old already. and she still acts this way. i can understand if she was uncomfortable with him expressing interest in her. i even understand her wanting to avoid him after that (altho more mature people usu won't avoid you just cos of that), but it's how she acted after that that is irritating.<br><br>apparently she blamed him for everything (for spoiling the friendship - she said she felt "cheated" or something like that) and wouldn't admit that her actions in any way led him on. i think more grown up ppl talk abt these things and examine their own actions rather than just blame other people. even when he tried to talk to her she just shut him off, avoided his calls and rejected his offer to just take a step back and remain friends. and then of cos almost as if to take revenge she started flirting with this other new guy in front of him. i mean how insensitive can you get? some more b4 this she told the first guy she was glad they were such close friends. if this is how ppl treat close frens, who the hell needs enemies? all i know is that she really hurt his feelings.<br><br>heard that she is quite okay looking. maybe that's why. these days i perceive an inverse r'ship between the way a person looks and the depth of character they have. some fairly good looking ppl have such shallow characters it's really sickening. and they think they can get away with it too. but i guess maybe god is fair. where he gives in terms of looks he takes away in terms of strength of character and level of maturity. i wonder tho how many people really care for such things. or do they just stop at looks? really pity this new guy. once things go sour she may well vent her childish spite on him in some way. some women can go to such great lengths just to take revenge on you. it's like deriving pleasure from cruelty. i wonder what they gain from it. they should really learn to grow up. and think about how they would feel if someone acted that way with them if the tables were turned.<br><br></div>
