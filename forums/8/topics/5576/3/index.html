            <div class='col-md body'>Well Fries, what a sad story you've got here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">? Maybe its that girl who are a bit too choosy. OK if she got tha look!!! But tha behaviour?? Attitude?? Do you think she have that sufficently? well theres no harm to be patience and to give way. Juz hope for tha best for her k? Hope she get what she wants and never regret. im sure you too will be happy if you know shes happy rite? Im sure you will get better than her (may not be tha look but other things). ITS me who look pathetic and ugly  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> thanx dear meow for aggreeing (yeaaaaaaaa...).<br><br>AngelDark.. plural for 'chio bu' is 'chio bus'. hehehe. well for girls choosing bengs<br>it depends on how one look. different people being grown up at their own ways so their choice of choosing is also different. And tha way we look at bengs also differs in each individual.<br><br>Tha most possible cause is tha change of trend as this world gets older and more sophisticated. For example tha change in attitude between children and parents. i dun think i need to discuss this cos im sure people here know what im referring to  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">. well more hi-tech things are.. more dependent we were and if we got what we need.. we will be complacent and stop working... its tha road to laziness! when we see in tha olden days, where things are simple and primitive.. people must sweat up to get what they want. Discipline is well maintained. But now...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>hmmm who say bengs got low qualification? Not all Bengs are like that dear Angeldark.<br>but i agree most of them were. hmm.. in Singapore, everyone must upgrade themselves in order to face new problems in future. So do bengs! Nowadays i bet there are a number of them having diploma and even degree cert! if not i dun think they can survive in Singapore for tha next few years. u see, nowadays we can see many 'upgraded' bengs. from only a pager.. now most of them owns a handphone and others are computer literate!  see.. they now more accessible and sophisticated too, equipping themselves  with useful stuffs and skills for tha future.<br><br>Of course! LIfe is never Fair. if so.. there'll never be any winner nor loser. there'll be no prisonners, corruptors, etc. Then, who will stay in tha Prison or pay fines??<br><br>"Well theres still lots of flies in tha toilet. You only need to be a piece of SHIT to attract them"<br><br>------------------<br>Professional Critics</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess I will have to speak up. I have to admit that I was those type of gers who fall for Ah Bengs. All my ex-bf were bengs. One of which whom I love with all my heart. I am going to share the story.<br>I am 18 yr old. It happen 2yrs 8 mths ago. I was 16 when he was 15. Ya he is 1 yr younger than me. He was a Ah Beng from some gang who high position. To make things clear, I was with him not because to think is cool or have face. I was attracted by his fun loving personality. I hate to say this but I feel that Ah bengs or "bad guys" are more interesting than those Mr Nice Guy who are afraid of this n that. Ah bengs wun constantly ask u to study and they take u to interesting places. They are more fun to b with. Although they make a good choice for a bf, it doesn't necessarily mean that he is a good husband.<br>Well, I dun consider myself pretty although he said that I am chio and some people claim that I am above average.<br>He and I came from 2 different wo8rlds. He is in the Normal stream while I am in the Special stream. I am a bit more well off than him I supposed. &amp; he was also on probation then for rioting n illegal gathering. This means that he is lack of freedom.<br>But I do love him a lot with all my heart and I believe there was a time when we truly love each other.<br>I am here to speak up for ah beng. He, my exbf, though may seem to be bad but he was really nice to me. He nv ever talk to me in a harsh or loud voice. He is just like wat Honey has described as the ideal guy.<br>We was together for one year b4 we broke up. There was a lot of reasons. And one thing was that he was inferior of himself. I was desvastated. I was willing to give up my education n future for him. I did not study for my O level but spend time on him. Although somehow or rather i still manage to fluke and be a 9 pointer which ends me now in a JC.<br>I was willing to do anything for him because he was really good to me albeit his mistreatments sometimes. For the first time in my life, I tried slashing my wrist for him, almost jump of from a high rise flat an run away from home after we broke up.<br>We had broken off for 1 yr 8 mth. Eversince, I nv accepted anyone because I promise myself that I will wait for him for 2 yrs. It appears to be very stupid of me, i know. But who ask me to have given my whole heart to a Ah Beng who will be taking his O level this year while I  am taking my A level. If u were reading this, forgive me for publise our story.<br>4 mth more to 2 yr.. I know that you still consist of a considerable amount of weightage in my heart. Hopefully, I am able to get over u in the near future.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Doh!!!! I was supposed to go to sleep, but I should felt I should comment for u first...<br><br>Firstly, I'm really sorry for u having to lose him, but I have other things to say 2 u...hopefully to make u feel a bit better.  If not, more enlightened.<br><br>U must be 18 now. Close to 19?  Ur future is never worth giving up for anyone.  Period.  I've always felt that people who slash themsleves are the type who can't handle their feeling very well.  The process of slashing ur wrist is done for somekind of acknowledgement...of what is up to the individual...but usually it is their way of acknowledging their pain, loss and has a lot to do with the attempt to gain attention from that person. Maybe a cry for help(but this one is more of a psychiatrists line).  U slash for him to know ur feeling pain for him.  It's ur way of expressing what u cannot, in any other way, handle urself emotionally.<br><br>This usually falls upon deaf ears and eyes though.The reaction u search for will be the one that's immediate and not something that they would feel otherwise. (I hope that's not too vague).  Mutilation, in the end, serves very little to no purpose except to fortify the sorrow/pain that dwells inside ur heart.  It's really not my place to tell u what to do though..so it's here just for ur consideration.<br><br>No, all ah bengs aren't bad.  U suffer from the innocent girl/bad boy syndrome.  Ur family life is either quite lacking in an emotional sense or it's the opposite, totally loving.  It's really not all too uncommon for u to be attracted to these types as they provide something that u have never had before or haven't experienced yet.  Or maybe ur the type that lieks a little or a lot of danger.  Whether anything bad happens or not doesn't matter, because the shadow of danger always lurks behind this kind of guy/lifestyle.  Maybe u just don't like being in such a priviledged position.<br><br>Before I continue, I would like to point out that I am not attacking u.  I am merely analyzing ur situation and persoanlity type.  I know that it's all just wild speculation, but ...let me try anyway.<br><br>I'm sure people have told u that ur probably wasting ur time and life and all that BS right?  Well, what u do is up to u.  U have the right to choose ur path...But remember that u can't sacrafice for anyone at this moment in ur life.  Ur a little too young for that.  If u really think that this guy is mature enough to appreciate, much less understand what u r doing for him, u would probably be thinking with the wrong part of ur body(ur heart).  He's too young , hence must be immature, to be able to know what's happening around him.  Love is love and life is life.  What we see in movies and read in books is an exhaggeration of what real life is.  many girl, my close friends included, take them a little too literally.<br><br>U may think that I have no qualification to talk about this subject, but I do. I'm from America and the gangs there are much more vicious than anything u have here in Singapore.  I've been in slightly compromising positions before...many time...namely my face connecting with the pavement being hammered into such by 6 guys.  More than once or twice.  Over there, it's not a lifestyle like it is over here.  Americans living in big cities, in general, have to learn how to survive on the streets.  It's a survival thing.  Ur ah beng boyfriend doesn't have to live this life.  he chose it and he choise to get busted and into trouble.  His choices affect you directly and the fact that he's still ending up in positions that compromise your well-being, he really doesn't care as much as u care about him.  In the states, we have choices, and most everyone is in some kind of gang there or the other...It's for protections sake.  Noone makes them join and ultimately it's the indiviuals choice.  I chose never to join and paid miserably for it...but I chose life not safety.<br><br>A lot of teens there die before they hit 23.  They die by gunshots and whatever else way people can find to kill each other.  It's not a life u have to lead, nor he.  If ur in it because he can take u to whatever place and have fun, it's becasue he's got $$$.  Nothing else.  Obviously u've never dated many people before him.  In fact, I would be so bold as to say that he's probably ur first boyfriend.  Or first love...same thing.<br><br>My point is that u have two choices.  Choose life or choose a slow death.<br><br>U can get excitement evrywhere if u give it a chance.  Not everyone is boring.  Even the people here in this board are crazy animals...or else why r they here in the first place.  I'm definately not a bore.  I pub, Karaoke, drink, disco, spit, shit, and sometimes fight also.  Other's on this site are also like this.  It's not just Beng's.<br><br>In an ideal world, we would only need to worry about oursleves, but we have responsibilities...to our parents, brothers, sisters, friends...When u hyrt they hurt as well...<br><br>..By george, I feel hurt for u just reading ur story, which is why I'm preaching now.<br><br>Again, I have no right to say any of this...but please, take it from someone whose been down that road before.  These people care nothing about u.  The only thing they care about is their own survival.  Ur there as a convenience...Whether u want to believe that or not.  If u could look beyond emotion, u would see what I mean.  but that's very easy for me to say, I know.<br><br>It's not easy and these situations are never easy.  The situation that u r in is very difficult to break away from.  U r in a circle that u can't escape from, and I feel really sad to know that.  Maybe u don't want to break away...who really knows but u.<br><br>I know I have no right o ask anything of u.  I know u not and u don't know me.<br><br>We're total strangers, but it doesn't mean that strangers can't feel for another.<br><br>I hope u haven't taken my harsh words as an attack against ur boyfriend or character.  It's just that I've seen too many friends fall down that samle hole ur in and they never come back out from it.<br><br>If u feel like, I'm being unfair, I invite u to totally bomb my email with obscenity...but I also invite u to come here more often and talk about how things are with everything...or if u want, I extend an invitation fot u to mail me if u need to express something to a stranger.<br><br>Sometimes telling total strangers ur deepest feelings is a lot easier than ven admitting it to urself.<br><br>Anyway, enough with my holier-than-thou preaching.  I apologise for my assumptions and presumptions.</div>

Many a time, the girls get together with ah-bengs not because they like them as "ah-bengs", it's most probably because of their fun loving character, and them being an ah-beng is actually sort of a side-effect for them. It is actually a wrong view to look at it in such a way, saying that more girls like ah-beng. Ah-bengs will die off definately, as they grow older, they begin to realise what they have been doing in so-called "gangs" is actually defined as STUPID to what others see . They are actually branded as out-castes to the society. Those who still stick with gangs are the real losers. After they have grown up, this is where their real life begins and the girls that get together with them at this point of time, is actually after the same thing the girls that were together with them when they were called "ah-bengs" -- their FUN LOVING character. Nothing more than that. But if you girls look around enough, there will be a time when you all realise that actually there are many guys who aren't ah-bengs and are as fun loving or perhaps even more. Guys take note as in what the girls are looking for. Do not become an ah-beng to get a girl. Being an ah-beng is just a side-effect.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why do girls like Ah bengs?<br><br>Quoted from famous Taiwan author (can't remember her name):<br><br>Guys not bad, girls don't like.<br><br>Guess that "bad" means to be mysterious, not able to control, and thus will have to follow along instead of taking the lead, most girls like to be leaded right?<br><br>I am taking about this on my own experience. I am nece to this girl, put all my heart in it (and also my $$$ savings for 5 years) and she still end up with another married guy. Why? The irony thing is that she is telling the whold wide world that I am the best bf she ever had in her 25 years of life, out of 5+ bf, and she is still doing this? Best part is, other than this married guy, she is also with another guy that is 10+ years older than she is and that is a "square" relationship (dun know what word to describe) ? Why? Just because they treat her bad-der than I treated her?<br><br>Maybe that's why all ah-bengs get girl friends, they are bad enough.<br><br>Life is a matter of gambling ...<br><br>You will have to take risk. Much of them are not going to work out.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just something to say about Darling's story. Love really has no boundaries doesn't it? I believe that love should never be judged by educational level, family status or age but society tends to think that only people of equal status, especially education wise, a guy cannot be less educated than his gf. Sad but thats's the society we live in. Your love for him is deep but you shouldn't think of forsaking your life over it. Life is precious. There are people who want it but can't have it so treasure yours. Love does not mean using life as a stake.</div>

Its much easier for the proverbial Ah Beng to stand out becoz of his loud dressing, colorful hair and fancy talk.<br><br>Nice guys just fade into the background like the nice wallpaper you have in your room. Comforting to look at but hardly the stuff you would want.<br><br>Which is probably why girls prefer bad boys to the nice guys. Bad boys are more exciting more fun and more dangerous, qualities girls are probably more interested in when they are younger.<br><br>Which relegates the nice guys to be idea candidates for husbands but not boyfriends. By which then most of them are heartbroken and disillusioned with the concept of love.<br><br>But they continue being the nice guy despite knowing they'll never get the girl....<br><br>Perverse joy in self pity or pain??<br><br>Maybe I just enjoy the feeling of being lovelorn and rejected by love....<br><br>Coz its something thats so tragically beautiful, something that I never possessed....<br><br>Cheers<br><br>------------------<br>Why?

            <div class='col-md body'>It seems that girls, especially pretty girls have been bombarded by a lot of guys in this topic. Looking like an Ah Beng doesn't mean that the guy is one. It's just the dress sense. Same goes for Ah Lians. How do nice guys dress like? Hmm..casual T-shirts &amp; jeans, long sleeved shirts tucked in nicely in trousers. Anything which is not loud. Nice guys can be just as fun or even more fun? Don't find excuses for yourself. What you are you are. If you do not show this 'fun' side of yours, who's going to know? You need not show this 'fun' side only after you know a someone special. If you show this 'fun' side you may just become a very attractive person. I think young people just want to have fun while they can. Imagine years down the road you'll be working &amp; you can never do what you want to do when you're young. For now, I think girls just want to have fun &amp; 'Ah Bengs' are the ones who can provide them. Still I think you've been generalizing too much. Not all girls like Ah Bengs. What you see is just a portion because these people hang out in places where everyone can see them. I believe that there are just as many girls who like nice guys. Have you ever thought that there are also many girls who detest Ah Bengs? Maybe you cannot stand the sight of pretty girls with Ah Bengs but if you look properly around, not all the girls with Ah Bengs are pretty. I should only say only a handful of them are pretty. For those early 20s nice guys who're still single, don't worry. Desperation will lead you to regret. Think about what's missing in you or wrong with you that hasn't made you into an attractive guy yet. There's always someone for everyone.<br><br>------------------<br>Even if I have a pair of wings on my back, I cannot fly because I haven't flown for a long time. Because I haven't flown for a<br>long time, I may already lost the courage to fly. If I try to fly again, I may not survive the flight. Then again, maybe I did not fly<br>before in the first place. Even if my wings are broken, I'll still try to fly. Until I can meet up with you.</div>
