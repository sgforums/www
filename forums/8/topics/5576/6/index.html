            <div class='col-md body'>abfackeln: Please... instead of stereotyping the Bengs from bad experiences, what about trying to understand their motivations? The supposed Beng/Lian subculture is the modernisation of Chinese clannism. Coupled with a flock mentality ("One fly all fly") the latter culture has become homogenised by mutual influence; They live on opinions of peers, believing them reliable. Its only in the mid nineties that western and some asian influences (e.g. Hong Kong, and her all-famous triad movies + Japanese teenagers and their hip but garish dress sense) introduced shock culture-- leading to the Beng as we know him today, fashion and otherwise. For me, I noticed that the ethics of Beng-dom are in fact what you may describe as rebelliously heroic. They make committed and trustable friends, IF you can look past the language barrier along with years of accumulated sterotyping.<br><br>To remain relevant with the thread topic, why does Mr. Beng get the girl without saving the day? Bengs have a tendency to be expressive and spontaneous and some girls do find it an intensely atractive trait. Also, actually they put in the hard yards, financially and in terms of attention, to make their partner's days. The overpowering possessiveness that Bengs exhibit towards their girlfriends gives them a sense of security. If anyone noticed, Bengs also have little hesistation to commit themselves if they believe a relationship is viable and are always optimistic, moreso than joe average who has to run off and consult a million friends before deciding about anything to that degree. Last of which, Bengs make passionate lovers (Yes, they may be emulating Andy Lau in his romance flicks, but that can do really well in elevating their girls to a higher state) I think that's all I can think of for now. If you really look at it, all the swearing, smoking and narcissism is immaterial given deeper insight into the Beng's social ethics. "kwah Simi?" --He's not afraid of standing up for himself and his friends... and never lets the opinions of the so-called greater society get him down.<br><br>On behalf of my former colleagues in the Techno/Eurodance business - You can point fingers at the subculture, but please leave Sparks disco of it, thank you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Rebellyon:<br><br>Your analysis is valid but let me offer you a different angle. Bengism is not even a subculture. It is a counterculture; a kneejerk reaction of the lower socio-economic classes to the mainstream. The lower socio-economic classes percieve that they have been marginalised by society and strive to find an identity thus reinforcing the ingroup outgroup bias. This identity they adopt depends on the cultural history of their society. In the Singaporean context, ingroup outgroup bias is very clear between, and even within the cultures. The chinese are historically clannish in behavior. This causes the formation or "gangs" or secret societies.<br><br>The Bengs and Lians yearn for upward social mobility yet openly reject it by adopting the percieved opposites of mainstream culture. Just look at their dressing and it doesn't take a very smart person to deduce that they want to be percieved as wealthy and stylish.<br><br>The link between repetitive hypnotic music and the counterculture still eludes me. Some people think that it is just a case of bad taste, but I think there are deeper correlations. I have nothing against Techno/Eurodance, I myself listen to Judge Jules, Brian Transeau and Einsterzunde Neubauten.<br><br>The things about Bengs that turn my stomach is that they think they can get away with everything and muscle their way through. Good for you if you're a Beng, but think about the person on the other end. It really sucks.<br><br>As for Sparks, I've never been there myself, but I imagine thats the place where Bengs and Lians would be happiest judging by the drunken hordes outside Taka after 3am.<br><br>Can Bengs abide by social norms? By definition they cannot because they are the counterculture. No one should make excuses for their ill behavior. Their reasons and intentions for their actions have been debunked to death and written in a thousand Sociology papers, and the police don't buy it either.<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>well said. Come to think of it, I never thought about Bengism as a counterculture. But then again, the roots of Anarchism and most of the worlds' interneccine conflicts derive from Chinese history. Perhaps deviation from mainstream society is built into us as a race for all we know. But then again, I'd be contradicting myself as I have just stereotyped my own race.<br><br>Hmmmm.... the kickback from the lower socio-economic classes in singapore must stem from somewhere- Perhaps it is caused by the white collar, English educated demography that is marginalising the latter. If things were going fine and there was an understanding between the "classes" in Singapore, perhaps less people would be moulded into the visage of our quintessential Ah-Beng/Ah-Lian?<br><br>Note that there are some in the counterculture (yes, I acknowledge it as such now) that are merely dabblers; To take on the mantle of the Ah-Beng is to receive his share of 'glamour' and it becomes socially acceptable for these individuals to carry out the myriad activities that the Beng is known to do, without being thought as 'weird', but rather, typical. Perhaps people find an identity in assuming this role and feel more complete in society by being such. I feel that I am not rationalising Bengism for society, any person is likely to make a mistake- Its on an individual basis that gangs and fights occur, not because being a Beng shapes them into a mean criminal ... but all fingers generally point towards those that are not in favour, no? Not all criminals are Bengs and not all Bengs are criminals.<br><br>Away from exploring Bengism, the point is that many girls are still endorsing our coarse hero as adequate (or even ideal!) partners... so for THEM, are the positive traits of being a Beng override those of his flaws in the eyes of polite society? Perhaps that is the way they see it? Or do they take the entire notion of being a Beng an issue secondary to the person; That the latter could be removed as a piece of clothing could, that the Beng label is not part of the person at all, but simply a vehicle... a medium for which he presents himself to society?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The analysis gets more complex here. I think it is the younger girls that are attracted to these qualities in the Beng. When they get older and more sophisticated they are more inclined to fall for the glamourous Dot Com superhero. (Of which I am not, unfortunately)<br><br>Lets here it from the girls in this forum now, what do the girls think?</div>
