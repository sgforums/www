            <div class='col-md body'>I understand what u r talking about.  I am also a very nice guy.  That's not to say that I'm ugly or anything.  In fact, I'm quite good looking and quite confident, but when I try for girls, they usually don't like me.  My failure rate is about 97%.  Somewhere up there.  I spent my entire 24 years of life thinking that if u were nice enough, girls would just fall head over heels for u.  How wrong I was.  I've been used and abused more times than I can count, and turned down even more just to see these same girls falling head over heels for rat bastards (bastard guys).<br><br>I'm quite macho also, so it has nothing to do with me being ugly or unmanly.  Simply put, women do prefer bastards over nice guys.  The phrase, "nice guys always finish last" is very true.  I think all u guys out there who are really nice guys know what I'm talking about.<br><br>The girls I do know (which are quite a lot when I think about it), usually only want me as a friend.  My question is, "What the hell good is it to get to know girls if they only want to be friends?!!!?"<br><br>I was with this girl that I cared very much about (about one year, and I knew that she cared very much about me too (she told me often that she loved me).  The only problem was that she would always remind me that she only saw me as a good friend and that I made the best friend on the planet.  I loved her a lot, but after a year of it, I just stopped seeing her.  She was angry at me, but what the hell...  It was torture watching her falling head-over-heels for guys who treated her like dirt. All the many guys she fell for  and went out with were just total ass-holes and I had a few "incidents' with them because of it.<br><br>Sorry for the long reply, but I really feel for this subject.<br><br>I hate being so nice, but no matter how hard I try, I cannot and will not betray who I really am...A foolishly nice guy.<br><br>In the end, we may have it tough while we see guys who aren't so good to their girls getting a better life...but I hope, maybe idiotically, that somehow we will be returned for our kindness to people... maybe...naive..yes....But hope, or else people like us will pass into oblivion.<br><br>cheers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Frankly I think you are right about the girls liking bastard guys.<br>It is always happening around me...and everytime I see it I get really fed up. Either you want to shoot yourself or you feel like shooting the guy (maybe that's why they banned guns in Singapore hahaha)<br>But seriously....I have tried to get closer to girls only for them to tell me....you're not my type...too sensitive, to emotional etc...<br>It's never a very concrete reason not to like someone...that's what I feel...<br>Other times I am simply not fast enough to get the girl and end up being her "Spare tyre" when her bf is not in town....that sort of makes me feel used but what to do ? Being a nice guy means you have to put up with all this silently...and forums like these are the only places we have to vent some frustrations.<br>Girls who are my friends and attached like to tell me lots of complains about their bf....like too busy...or too materialistic...etc...and how they wanna break up with them...but they never do !<br>It's like you like a girl who is attached and you wait forever for her to break up with her guy though she complains about him everyday !! It's really incredibly frustrating got the guy...<br>There are also girls who always seem to indicate they like you...but when you take it a little further like asking them out singly...they flatly refuse you...why ???<br>All I can say in conclusion is that...nice guys finish last....<br>But also hope that someday girls may like me for who I am...and things can change for the better...<br>For the sake of all nice guys out there...good luck !!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi ppl<br>Thanx for yr interest in my topic<br>My A levels are coming up so I wont log on so often. I'm going to make a homepage soon..straight after my exams which will end on the 26th of Nov. There will be stories abt how I was "used" (btw i neber had a gf and my first kiss has not been given away in case u ppl are not thinking "straight" u guys/gals will find out what i mean by "used" when my webpage is up which should be early or mid december if I'm not called up for NS yet) Anyway, getting back to where i left off..well, I'm not "blessed" with good looks and in this "modern" society which claims to be open but is probably too drugged by the unrealistic world of hollywood, I can sadly hide in a tiny corner and drown in the sea of misery and self-pity that engulfs me living only with a spark of light (hope) in this endless dark tunnel I'm in. Someone said this b4..hope is the last thing u lose..<br>Well I HOPE b4 i die I would just be given a chance to experience love in its entirety and not just the hurt and pain magnified and exacerbated by the fact that I'm a hungry piscean that's been deprived of the very thing that keeps me going...The hope that one day the special ger will come along And see me as who i am...not how i look..<br>which brings us to the next question: Does true love exist? Or does it only lie in the idealistic world that I live in?<br><br>P.S pls keep this discussion going I'll check back occasionally and I'll be posting the address of my webpage up maybe in early or mid december..<br><br>------------------<br>"If YoU fAiL tO lOoK bEyOnD lOoKs,<br>YoU fAiL tO aPpReCiAtE tRuE bEaUtY"<br>Â© Copyright 1999 FriesÂ® All rights reserved.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey fries<br>i know how u feel. maybe i haven't been 'used' b4 but like you i don't have a gf yet and im already in University (wat's NS?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I don't consider myself really bad looking and I do have girls as friends.<br>Actually, there ARE gals who don't only go for looks or the 'bastard' guy - they're just... rare compared to the others. By the time u're at my age, 2 things will probably happen:<br>1) gals who are considered good looking and yet want a 'nice decent' guy regardless of his looks for a bf will have been snapped up more or less permanently.<br>2) gals who aren't that good looking AND want a 'nice decent' guy regardless of his looks are still around, though some of them may already be attached.<br><br>So you end up with 2 situations. If you're the kind who goes after the 'pretty' gals who really look out for 'nice' guys like you, then you're gonna have a hard time. There are still a few single ones around, but your personality needs to really shine through to 'get' them  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>The 2nd situation - you're in better luck. There are still many 'not-so-chio' single gals around. It's just up to you to get them.<br><br>Of coz I left out the kind you're talking about, the chio but 'think-they-deserve-a-guy-just-as-good-looking-as-them' gals. I think everyone has their own idea of their  partner, but in this case, guys like u and I are clearly out of their league.<br><br>I may sound a bit realistic in the above paragraphs, but I sometimes wish too, that I could get a galfriend who has a great selfless personality and great looks too, but I know it's gonna be a long trip heading down that road. I guess after all, Im a human being - surely I can dream?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>"When we remember we are mad, the mysteries disappear and life stands explained."<br>-Mark Twain-<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The irony of the situation is that no matter how we might want some girl to judge us on our internal qualities, in the end, we also want that "chio" girlfriend. Quite hypocritical, isnt' it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>In the end, it's all about appearance, and when we can't get that level of satisfaction, we lower our standards and look for other qualities like compatibility or just willingness to tolerate our presence. The good-looking ones probably end up with not-so-good-looking ones because all the good-looking ones probably don't want to be outshone by their partners, or just go for other qualities like wealth/attitude, but certainly in the end, there's always someone left behind on the turnstile waiting with all the other rejects, and pairing up because even a substandard partner's better than lonely nights spent in empty houses...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here's one other perspective from the other side of the coin.....<br>There are girls out there, plenty in fact who much prefer the SNAG( tho not the self-proclaimed ones) to the Bastards. Perhaps no one here has had the good fortune as yet to encounter one but believe you me I have met many who would forego a Bastard any given minute, no matter how rich/handsome for a guy who can treat her good( like a princess), who would bring her to romantic movies, cry/laugh with her, bring her breakfast in bed, give her massages, have walks/talks with her, don't even dream of raising your voice or manhandlingp her and basically just love her to death. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Demanding? Aye, but that's what all you SNAG claim to be able to perform eh?:Ãž Then again.......how did the phrase all guys are Bastards orginate from?<br>So if you're unable to do live up to the term SNAG, please don't say you're one....unless you're really really really willing to give it your best shot. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">Maybe that's why some girls choose to be with Bastards, because they can be sweet as sugar yet posses the worst temper on earth but who wouldn't give up a bit of their pride and dignity to be treated as a princess even if it's for a day?<br><br>honey<br>(still waiitng patiently for her SNAG in shining armour to arrive)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The issue now seems to be about SNAG.....after honey mentioned it in her reply. Frankly, I feel that girls' expectations of the SNAG is a romanticised by Hollywood version of the perfect guy. It seems that girls like the guy to be sweet to them, take them for walks, cry at movies and all that....which is not too demanding but are you sure that is all ?<br><br>This may only be a surface appraisal of teh SNAG but there may be many inherent qualities that girls look out for but cannot voice. This is not to say that SNAGs are extinct, but it's just that guys (Especially in Singapore) tend to show less emotions when watching sad movies, listening to sad songs etc...it's all a rather ingrained cultural factor.<br><br>From a more personal point of view, I have encountered cases whereby I have shown emotions when watching movies or reacting to music...only to stared at strangely by my peers who are totally unused to such behaviour from a guy ?<br><br>So let me pose a question now: WHat exactly is the behaviour for a SNAG ? Are they generally accepted in society ? Please don't tell me they are because of the funny reactions I have received....one girl even told me that it is very uncharacteristic of a guy to cry so much for a movie (it was "Message In A Bottle") and another had even rejected my date on the basis that I was "too emotional" for a guy. She said she needs a guy to be able to comfort her when SHE cries, and not the other way around.<br><br>However, all I can say is that would be the way for me to react...to show feelings and not to hide them behind masks like so many Singaporeans seem to do...yet it seems that we are all so used to doing it that when a person (guy) finally shows some emotions, the girls think he is strange...so can anybody explain this phenomenon ?<br><br>Thanks for all the postings so far they have been stimulating my interest as I study oh so hard for my exams ! =)<br><br>Hope to hear from all of you soon !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Fries.<br><br>Exams are a shit and mine's next week. . wondering wat I am doing here also. .I'd like to share my experience with you. .  As for me.. In my 22 years . . I have been lucky in that I have had a chance to experience true love once. Being in love can bring one such emotions never felt before . . waited so long for someone in my life to come along. . and hey .. it happens man! However it is often said that love alone won't fill your stomach, however much we want to believe in the contrary. The sun still has to shine tomorrow, blah blah. My point is be realistic. If you sit there waiting for your dream girl to drop out of the sky. . haha my friend you are sadly mistaken. One thing I've learnt, Never be afraid to love. Holding back brings you only more pain. I've found. . being too nice only works to your disadvantage . .dun ask me why but that's what I've found out . .<br><br>Hmm. . army comin soon for ya soon eh? Chill out before ya go in. . it's a piece of shit. Its one of the most nerve wracking time of your life. Depends on how ya view it also..<br><br>I wonder what is your aim in looking for a girlfriend is. Ask yourself. . having that someone there for you always? It ain't always so. I'm looking for someone who will make a good wife and companion into the twilight years (provided mr marlboro allows me to <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> ) Heh . .   give yourself a few years . .you'll find you'll change in your thinking.. I used to be as idealistic as ya. . so perhaps I tot I'd drop a line here to change your mindset. . but I know . .as I was  once there before. . Advice is so often listened but unheeded. Good luck wif the babes   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Ps. you're still young. .17-18 perhaps? Get outta army then we'll talk .. hehe. .</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, personally, I see the point that you guys are making but perhaps it just isn't your time to have a girlfriend yet =)<br>Not to be demeaning or anything but have you guys really put an all out effort?<br>Furthermore, I agree that being nice and sensitive to a girl touches her heart but you would have to choose the correct target first right?<br>I do not see the point trying for a girl who's already attached or wishes to concentrate on her studies. However nice you may be, the girl would still treat you as a friend.<br>Well, getting a girlfriend isn't that hard as well. Perhaps you should lower your standard a bit. I'm not good-looking or anything ( In fact, I'm a little plump), but I do have girls who liked me. Hehe, I would have to admit though, they were not 'chio' as people would term them, just strictly average as I would think.<br>That would be all for the moment =)<br>Cya.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hiya! For those people who are always often hurt by failed relationships, please don't be down on the dumps too long. Depression only serves to lower your self-confidence and self esteem and that only makes you feel worse about your life. You gotta have the guts to recover, stand up and go on with life. For those people who believe that you have to chase girls to get girlfriends, well i have to admit that does work sometimes, but other times, love can be found in the queerest of places. What i'm saying is that in order to find your mr or miss right, u gotta have patience, just go with the flow in life and somehow or someway, u're gonna get a true love partner who might even become your life partner as well. Heck! i'm not sure if this is really right, but i'm saying this from personal experience. True love can only be found when u look through one's appearance ( obviously!) and understand all his/her qualities and appreciate them. Love isn't only about understanding (in fact no one can truly fully understand another individual, no exception for lovers) ,its also about giving and sharing. Lot of commitment here and there, and sometimes if it doesn't work out, u might even have to break off to find another suitable one. In short, searching for true love ain't easy, it involves a lot of mutual understanding, commitment and even opportunism. But once u get it, u'll enjoy the experience to the fullest. Good luck for u folks out there. I have to go study for the big As....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>B.T.W, no matter how nice u can be to someone u like, u should always be yourself. Be honest, if u just try or pretend to be nice to someone, he/she will appreciate it but that doesn't mean they will really know u as a person and individual. U have to be yourself when u are in any kind of relationship. Perhaps ( who knows?) thats probably why some gals like ah bengs, coz they're honest with themselves. Personality is the key.<br><br>Again i have to stress this: if the person u like chooses to follow another individual, if he/she really wants to go with the fella, then just turn your head and look elsewhere. I know all this is hard coz it isn't that easy in real life. But just try to be yourself, ok? Cya guys and gals!</div>
