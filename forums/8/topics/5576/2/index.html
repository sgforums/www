            <div class='col-md body'>To Meow,<br>Thanks for the kind words...really :-)  wanna be friends can mail me : firewire_ieee@hotmail.com<br><br>To Honey,<br>I am a knight in shining armour!  No, not shy.  u know why? Basically becasue I'm very confident in myself and what I say, although might sound ego, is true.  Just to let u know, I will also just as quickly point out my faults.<br>It is not unrealistic for u to look for someone like what u are looking for.  I know because I'm like that.  Although, I think that u wouldn't believe me if I told u and yes, I happen to be good looking (depending on what u term it to be).  If u want, we can arrange to meet for coffee and u tell me whether I'm lying or not.  u can alo mail me at the above email address if u want to have a firendly discussion about it.  (Don't worry, just a friendly outing).<br><br>Let me just say that the kind of guy u are looking for is very rare...period.<br><br>For the rest of the people here,<br><br>It takes a lot of hard work y'know.  Yes, I have had the opportunity to experience real love quite a number of times.  I've had about 6-7 GF before and of those, I experienced love with 3 of them. Yes, it was really wonderful and each lasted about 2 years before we went our separate ways (but still very good friends, mind u.  All my girlfriends though didn't just land on my lap.  If some of u have read some of my other postings (by FIREWIRE), you'll know that I count how many times I get rejected and how many are successes.  My failure rate is like around 95%.  No shit man.  It aint easy to get rejected so many times. I would spend many cold nights drowning in depressive states over getting rejected.  It really isn't easy. Especially if u just keep getting rejected over and over with no end in sight.<br>What kept me going u ask?<br>It's the fact that I wanted to share my life with someone and I wanted to be a part of someones elses life.  But more than that.  It almost seems like it's an inborn impulse for most people to feel this...During those years (I'm 25 now), I was a lone-wolf and being with the "in" crowd was a major factor to hetting a girl.  I had to work, hand, mouth, and foot, to meet the girls that I met.  In the end, the girls that I ended falling in love with were the ones from my class or in my classes at one time or another.  It's triply difficult if u were to look for girls on the street or in a pub/disco.  believe me, unless ur good-looking or/and have $$$ (ka-ching), u won't be walking homw with 7 digits in your pocket or a girl under ur arm.<br><br>My point is that u must give it total commitment.  For us guys, especially nicer ones, it must be a commitment or else u will give up half way.  U have to keep trying without looking like u are desperate.  Believe you me, that is the hardest part. :-)<br>Just go out there and keep getting rejected.  Go home and cry about it.  Bother your parents abotu it.  Bother your siblings and tell them your frustrations.  Your friends will run if every time they see u, they know u want to agonize about getting another rejection.  :-)  trust me  ha ha.:-)  your family can't...:-)<br><br>Isn't it so unfair!??...women don't even have to work a fraction of this to get a relationship.  Even in a relationship, the guy is expected to do most of the work to keep it going.  Really shitty actually, but if u can enjoy it, then all the better.  But it's still unfair.<br><br>PS-you don't have to lower your standard if you are willing to suffer to get the woman u really want. But remember this:<br><br>"No matter how hard you love someone, it doesn't mean that they'll love you back"<br><br>The scary thing now for me is that I will be leaving school soon and that means I will have to look for women outside the classrooms and lecture halls.<br><br>in the words of Mcalley Culkins(Can't spell his name):<br><br>AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First I would like to thank you all once again for your enthusiasm in response to this topic. The Qn I want to ask is : " How do u get a ger to give u a chance when they have alredi condemned u because u dun look as well as they want u to?"<br>Those of u in the same boat will understand this...GERS dun give u a chance no matter how nice u r because they have alredi condemned u cos of yr looks....and then they say that oh there are no nice guys around. Plssssss! I think wat u mean is that there are no GooD-looking NICE guys around. Well there arent! Think about it..If that guy is such a hunk do u think he will stay faithful? there will be tonnes of gers drooling and waiting for u to break up with him so that they can work their charms on him..and to be fair..let's say there are such guys...maybe 0.00000000000000000001 of the population...let's say there are such guys..do u think they are still single and available? They would have been snapped up and the gers will neber let them go...<br><br>To Firewire...<br>I have a few Questions to ask u...<br>Since u claim yourself to be so handsome and so nice...y is it that u got rejected so many times? Well my guess is that there must be some major flaws in the character..This is not a personal attack..I just feel that maybe it has something to do with yr Ego?? maybe u r too overconfident?<br>Second thing..<br>If u were so nice y did those 6-7 gers break up with u? u said each relationship lasted abt two years...lets assume that u got into a relationship straight after u break up which i hope is not the case...then u mean to tell me u have been going steady since u were a child?? 2x7=14 and u r 25 and I have alredi assumed that u went into a relationship straight after u broke up and that I dun think is the case anyway...so it means 25-14=11 u have been going steady b4 u even reach puberty...wont u must be very attractive huh?<br>And btw 2 yrs is not that long...I know nowadays it seems that if u r able to substain a relationship for one yr it means wow! but hey..what's the use if u r going to break up in the end...<br>And one final thing...<br>u said that u werent trying to get to know gers by telling them how handsome and how nice u really are.....<br>then y is it that u keep advertising yr email and keep asking gers to go out with u if they didnt believe u? Isnt that Advertising?<br><br>------------------<br>"If YoU fAiL tO lOoK bEyOnD lOoKs,<br>YoU fAiL tO aPpReCiAtE tRuE bEaUtY"<br>Â© Copyright 1999 FriesÂ® All rights reserved.<br></div>

Cool it dudes, relak lah, take it easy.....<br><br>I'm sure everyone can see by now that the subject of niceness and SNAGness is all relative and subjective. What is overly-emotional to one might be deemed as hard-heartedness to another. Let others judge all they want, let them mock. But in all seriousness, is that how we want to live life? By the standards and expectations of people who are not worth US in the first place? So what if as a guy, you wanna bawl your brains out or if you need a shoulder to do the bawling? Is that wrong? Who died and made made us God that we should frown upon such responses and actions and term them "unmanly", sissy","kuniang" and what have you.

            <div class='col-md body'>Wahhhhh this topic kinda hot too huh?<br>Well Fries, I'll give ya a thumb up!<br>Hopefully im not too late to say anythin in here <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> cos im juz as green as a grass, juz pop out of nowhere and there i am!<br><br>This topic and all tha meaningful responses that ive seen had given me a nice vicious scratch on my head, releasing all tha dandruff that falls to tha ground like snow (guessed that i got to change moi signature soon as i realised that i dun really have that kinda title) trying to organise tha wordz that had been processing in moi brains for tha past few minutes.<br><br>Hmm ive seen some deviations in tha topic here; from a general question to a personal one. Well, to inform ya all again, tha topic is about "why do gers like ah bengs and not nice guys?" NOT "why i dun have a girlfrend" but theres still a connection though - relationship between males and females in a type of living thing called humans.<br><br>Ill try moi best though, to make a general comments regarding this, so lets see how it goes..(sorry if im looong winded..cos i try to make it comprehensive for KIDS to read too!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> (crapp..am i suffering from exam fever too? ish!)<br><br>nice guys...well its quite hard to define it though, cos different people have different definitions for it (different type of dictionary used i guessed). its like a Hen will never say a male duck is nice or a female duck never say a cockerel is handsome.<br>This depends on ones eyes. occasionally its tha eyes that judge, even though we try to defy it. but its tha EYE. wonder how nice, peaceful and undivided we would be if all human species are blind. no one will differentiate anyone and no one will become a failed replica of others (moi definition; bengs are failed replicas of westerners)<br><br>well not ALL girls like bengs (depends on which countries u all are comparing with cos almost all countries got bengs; me here talking about singapore) in fact, they only make up few % in tha population in singapore<br>and about half tha total teens and young adults in here and i believe that tha number is growing (gosh). some girls like each other too!(potential lesbians; i got lots of pics showing girls "play" each other up (mainly westerns but girls here are picking it up fast), some girls like their books, careers, pets and other non-living stuffs! (potential celibates), some like bad guys (potential contributors of high divorce rate here), and some like good guys (potential happy families). well, influence contributes tha largest factor on who will get what.<br><br>hmm.. if we look in other ways.. we can rank those girls. those who r hard to find (especially those make up happy families) may be like a jem or diamond or pearl or gold or platinium or whatever that r precious. Of course u cant get them anywhere<br>but they EXIST. such that we need to 'blend'<br>ourselves, having lots of solutions that branches from a particular problem. in other wordz, we got to work SMART (NOT HARD) for it. im sure many will say you r not working smart enough if you are trying to find gold nuggets in tha Singapore soil. well humans are not called animals cos they have the ability to think sensebly and logically. well, make use of that. its tha GOD's greatest gift to us all. well for those who will make up tha 'waste of tha society', surely they come in abundance! like nitrogen in the air and pests at home. they can pollute and they can influence too!<br><br>well for guys .. its tha attitudes.ATTITUDES Bro! bengs and sort of never complains about their attitides or behaviour. its only us, tha so-called and self-proclaimed nice guys that whines and trying to compare on how high our status with them. well... 1 suggestion, be yourself bro. theres no need to follow others. cos more likely we will be tha failed replica of them. being unique and different from tha rest do attract. work SMART and take all chances that come by. dun worry if failed. learn from them and hopefully u get resistance from failing in future. Remember, Einstien/Edison (whatever cos i forget his name) failed to light up 1000 bulbs before succeed. Dun Give up! Like Bengs, they never give up cos they always not happy wat.<br><br>For tha reasons why girls like bengs, hehehe im still surveying this topic to get tha full picture and possible hypotheses. mabe you all can help too. we all gather all tha informations and help our Dear Fries to get tha final answer to his Question.

            <div class='col-md body'>To 2 questions poted to me aerlier.<br><br>I'm actually not handsome.  I think I said slightly above average.  BIG, BIG ..difference.  Don't worry though, I didn't take any of it as a personal attack.  i wrote what I wrote full well knowing that it would sound really ego...some of my other postings are about this subject...<br><br>I am nice.  I never used to be like I am now. It wasn't until I was 18 or 19, before I started to look ok.  If I can find a picture of me at mid teenage years, I will send u.  It will show u the dog that I was.  I don't know, my parents must have put me through a transmographying process by way of hiring madd scientists doing their deeds to me while I slept...or something, but I came out looking ok in the end.  thank god.  Not that it helps much, but it does.  I digress again..seems to be a trademark of firewire...<br><br>I'm not so ego in real life:-)   A bit, but but to that extent.  What I write here, I write for many reasons, the least of which is to blow up my ego.<br><br>I started dating between the age of 17 up.  Most of the 6-7 were just quick things.  The first love i had (which was probably the strongest) was with a girl about 2 years older than me.  She taught me many things, but it ended pretty quickly.  She loved me a lot (I still think of her and it still hurts like mad, and I her, but I was vry unexperienced then.  She did most of the work and initiated many things.  I blame inexperience for it.  In the end, she gave up becasue she had a lot of guys going for her who were obviously better lookers than I was. and I was just too slow for her.  She couldn't wait any longer for me to catch up so she left and i have never been able to forgive myself for losing  such a great thing.  Also I was leaving to come back to Singapore and she knew it, which must have been a reason for her leaving me also.  I don't know, it definately was a pure love (I know it sounds sappy), but after I left, I sent her some really not so nice letters telling her how I felt about it all, and she hasn't ever contacted me again.<br><br>That was the best four months of my life...This would be the thing that I would base all other relationships on.  It had to be as good, I had to feel as good.  But it took a long time for me to realise that every relationship will make u feeel differently.  U will never love someone else the same way u loved the lst one.<br><br>Anyway, I came here and met a really pretty Indonesian girl in my class and she didn't automatically like me.  i had quite a hard time getting her.  With a lot of help and borrowing $$$(ka-ching) form a good friend, I was able to get her.  That lasted about 2 years and it was fantastic.  The problem was that we were worlds apart in everything.  She was wild and outgoing and I was quiet and introverted.  Our love lasted so long even with so many glaring differences because we somehow fell head over heels for each other after we got together.  Don't ask me how or why.  I don't know why she would fall so hard for a guy like me, but in the end, the differences did get the better of the relationship.  She was constantly being hunted by other guys and I used to be really insecure because she was rich and I wasn't.  These guys were all good looking and rich you know.  Driving and private apartment and all that...couldn't compete. In the end, I never doubted that she would eventually fall for one of those guys, which she did.  She did the deed with him and told me about it (we were always able to talk to each other no matter what happened), I was really hurt and shit....obviously anyone would fell pain upon having ur gf telling u she went and slept with a good looking guy.  Things felt starbge for a few days and i wasn't able to take it anymore and I told her that we should go our separate ways.  She didn't want to break up with me and told me she still loved me, but we discussed it and always knew that it was over and we had grown to be very different people already.  That was really sad.<br><br>I spent the next 2 years searching like mad for any kind of female companion...besides my female friends who "only saw me as a good friend"  NUTS! I tell u. :-)<br><br>It is this period in my life that I write and lament about.  It was a long and lonely 2 years.  this was when I met rejection after rejection.  I don't know, now that I think about it, maybe women can spot desperate guys  from a mile away.  They tend to stay clear of those types you know....:-)<br><br>Maybe that was my reson for having such a low success rate.  Eventually I met this ah lian whoo was really hot and fell head over heels for her.  She was really screwed up to me, but I knew she cared about me a lot but could never find a way to show it to me.  She is one of those girls who always go after fucked up guys.  Anyway, i stayed with her for about a year as her GOOD friend :-p  Whatever the hell that means.<br><br>It was with her that my confidence in myself started to rise.  For some strange reason, even after all the crap she put me through (physical and verbal abuse), I realised that i didn't want to spend my life like this and it just so ahppens that I met a really nice girl at school and we hit it off.  Iwent with her and she's great.  She's very stable in the relationship and is very good to me, but oh so dull.  Doesn't like to do anything....I guess u give up all those things if u want this kind of person...Been with her for 2 years.<br><br>I didn't mean to tell u my life story, but I thought if I told u in a short sentence, I wouldn't be explaining myslef properly.<br><br>I would like to say that I was really lucky to have met her because her first impression of me was really shitty.  She thought I was really funny looking.  When I tell u what attracted her to me, u'll scream out in agony for the sheer shallowness of it.<br><br>She fell for me because of my accent. I'm asian mind u, but got western accent.  Other than that, she thought I was ...well I won't blst myslef anymore, but u know what I mean.  What started out as a really lame thing to like about someone became my longest lived relationship where I felt the most secure.<br><br>In the end, all my words could prove useless to people on this board because of it.<br><br>Just to end it,  I Apologise for writing such a long essay extolling the differences in my love life.  Interpret it anyway u want, but it's here.<br><br>for the record, I was as shallow about her also.<br><br>i went out with her because her hair was nice....I'm sure I'm gonna get a pounding from people on the board for the shallowness of it.<br><br>ok, hope that answers ur Questions.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What do u guys define as an ahbeng? Is he a guy who dresses to kill in shirts and pants, a slacker type who smokes and swears?<br>Maybe we shouldn't judge too much by appearances?<br>Coz I have known a few pple who would, at first glance, be derisively sneered at,"eeks, an ahbeng!", but are really, really sweet to their girls(who happen to be my friends)Could that be why most ahbengs seem to get gals, and usually pretty ones at that?<br>Then there's another factor, some ahbengs get girls to show them off, so they WORK at getting a gf, and at KEEPing her?No, I don't approve of this kind of reasons for getting a steady, but their attitude towards getting a gal seems to work.<br>They look after the gal, and spend lots of time with her.<br>One more thing, why do most guys I knoe and see outside dress so sloppily? It looks even worse when they're with a gal who has obviously taken the effort to look better(if slightly) for his sake.<br>I guess narcissism of the ahbeng's part( u know, the endless preening in front of any shiny surface, the ever-present comb...maybe not orange and pointy-ended anymore, but still somewhere on his person.Looks ARE superficial, but in our society,isn't that what makes the first impression? You could be incredibly intelligent and witty and caring etcetc, but if u can't be bothered to lose those 'mommy's boy' clothes, or worse, jeans and tees that probably belong in the Karanguni man's keeping ( or the dump), how do u expect to keep the gal interested long enough to find out how wonderful u r?<br>I refer to self-proclaimed nerds.I don't believe that u have to be a nerd.Being smart and nice and bookish does not automatically qualify u for nerd-dom.<br>I'm a JC now, and I see lots of these incredibly smart guys...and to a lesser extent gals who act nerdy and look nerdy cos they think that it is the right image for a young, intelligent student.<br>I think you all know the type...inch thick specs,hair that doesn't seem to be of any definable cut or style...nice pple don't have to look like that to look decent.<br>As long as you dress well...(i don't mean expensively ok),exude confidence(no swaggering either), and try to present ur best self,I don't see why bengs should 'always get the girls'<br>( but seriously, i dun see why nice guys and bengs sre mutually exclusive)<br>*maybe I'm jes confused*<br>I've had 5 bgrs so far, and funnily enough, I was happiest when my 'beng'(no they didn't smoke or drink...at least not once I got my claws in them,little pubbing time too) spent most of 'HIS" time one me....u know those oh-so-long phone calls? And lots of message pages from his handphone, just to tell u he missed u&gt;?...It's little things like that,that endear them to us gals...Of course not if he does them because he thinks that it is the right thing to do, DUh! Females are not dumb, deaf or blind u know!<br>My current boyfriend is probably what most pple would term an ex-beng.We've been together more than 9mths, and I'm happy....Maybe cos I sort of reformed him...=)But I like the way he dresses...(sporty without being sloppy..I HATE slippers)now...he doesn't smoke or drink at all now....<br>Maybe girls like the challenge of reforming an ex-beng or ex-serial love-em-and-leave them type...it is satisfying...<br>Ok, I think I've spouted enough erudite nonsense....if u think what I have said is garbled and majorly BS, then that's ur prerogative, and stuff the steroetypes ok?<br>Classifying pple ain't cool...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Do girls only go for Ah Bengs?... many that I have known chose to go for the quality male instead of the fluffy ones..<br><br>I think it might be hasty to categorize people as Ah Bengs right away. Some of my friends that are lawyers-to-be or doctors consciously choose to wear clothes that appear to be marginal. That is simply their individual choice and reflects their taste in fashion. I am on my way to getting a finance degree from a top american university but back home i always choose to wear "ah beng" clothes too, hehe. It's simply more comfortable   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>The bottom line I feel though, is that guys have to distinguish themselves in some way. You can be nice, mean, whatever.. but you should have a purpose in life other than girls. Too often I see guys who have no real purpose in life think that they will get girls simply because they are "nice". Nobody likes a drifter I think. I set my plan to establishing a solid career above all else but you'll be surprised at how favourable the responses I get from girls when I tell them relationships will have to take a second place. Get a purpose in life other than girls my friends, and by god they will come!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think that there's a danger in wallowing in pain for too long, but I think it's safe to say that everyone here is just in the process of exampling, explainging, and discussing...:-)<br><br>Seriously though, Everyone has been hurt one way or another.  Some lucky schumck out there has never, but let's not talk about those lucky few....<br><br>It's what u eventually learn from that experience.  Maybe I failed to note that I did learn a lot from each realtionship. It's like I said somewhere else, u can't just jump into a relationship expecting that it's going to be perfect.  Ur green and u make mistakes in more ways than one.  Every relationship u have will hone your relationship skills and improve ur patience and understanding.  It's a preparation for when U meet that person u want to marry.  Obviously if u met someone u thought was for u (as wife) and u never been in a relationship before, u will have a hard time.  Unless ur lucky u will make enough mistakes that lead to the end of it.  then ur sad and have to look again.<br><br>It's all about learning from each and every relationship,...quick relationship or long.

            <div class='col-md body'>Why do gals like Ah Bengs &amp; not nice guys? Well there must be a certain X factor missing in certain nice guys. Maybe you're TOO NICE. Maybe being too nice gives too fake an impression. How do you actually define nice? Caring, considerate, trusting, concern, obedient? Well, if you overdo it in front of the gal, pleasing her every sinlge thing.... you seem like a dog to the girl(No offence). So for all the nice guys out there, be yourself &amp; DON'T try too hard to be nice. There's always someone for everyone.</div>
