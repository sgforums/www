            <div class='col-md body'>Not all girls juz want fun and laughter. I digress : personally i would prefer someone of substance than a chiobu, but being both would be a bonus <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> i always believed in substance over style, but dat doesnt mean we engage in intellectual verbal duels everytime we meet, becoz there is always a balance to everything. Excessive fun or otherwise is a bad thing, and who said good guys doesnt have a lighter and "fun" side of their own? true, he may not as fun as a beng but each has its own unique and special sense of "fun-ness" within himself, which maybe be equally appealing to a girl. Ironically, liking a person may not be becoz of any certain reason but juz becoz he/she felt a certain feeling within himself/herself, this is where the so-called "X-Factor" plays a big part(which i may explain in my later postings). A girl may like a guy not becoz he is a beng/good guy/whatever, but simply becoz she juz has this special feeling whenever she is wif him, no certain attribute or quality within the guy causes the ger to like him; but simply becoz of the "sum" parts of him which attracts her. which means dat each personality/physical trait plays an equal part which may explain his appeal. (geddit?) So instead of trying to improve yourself to suit others, so why not juz be yourself and do whatever u tink is correct?(as long as it doesnt hurt anyone), who noes...things happen the way u least expect it... and one fine day while u walk in the streets, u may find ur one true soulmate. (4give me for spouting such nonsense cos im a die-hard romantic). Anyway on the lighter side of things, let us use probabilities and statistics to calculate the odds of finding ur dreamger(hey i din study MathsC in JC fer nuthin) : Out of 3.5 million Singaporeans, the arbitrary value of 5% would have the qualities u like for ur ideal partner, and out of this 5%, 5% would have a chance to meet you, and out of this 5%(duh), 5% would actually like you, and out of this 5%(this is getting boring), 5% would make u fall for her. All this sums up to 21(rounded down) possible individuals who might eventually walk down the aisle with you. Now how's dat for logic?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I posted this reply in response to Darling's article.<br><br>Maybe love is indeed blind, and perhaps it isn't really anyone's fault that we are blinded by love. Afterall, we are only humans and we do err.<br><br>I'm impressed by Darling's patience to wait, although I personally felt that the perserverance will most probably lead to nowhere, especially when you know that your wavelength is different.<br><br>However, if you really love him, you should never think of committing suicide as you should know that your death will certainly bring much pain to him(If he really loves you). If he doesn't love you, then you will be so silly to waste you life for someone so unworthy.<br><br>Think over if both of are really that compatitable. If the final answer is no, it's better to let him go and let the pain end. Sometimes, loving someone means learning to let go. If you love him deeply enough, you'll be able to let go.<br><br>Gd luck to your As and those out there who is taking their exams soon.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Whoa, it's been only 3 days since my last post and look how this place has grown...my my but we've been busy haven't we?<br>Kudos to all you wonderful, advocates of free yet intelligent speech, how liberating and refreshing it is in stifling sg where we can at last exhale our thoughts and feelings without some sort of fine being rammed down our throats and rebukes shoved up our asses.<br><br>Why do girls seem to be easier attracted to the richer, better-looking, smarter( u guys forget the brains bit!), funnier, better-dressed, better-wheeled( no car, then take taxi, no public transport, thank you very much),wittier, better-smelling( ewww, what was that....gawd...versace?!)....and the list goes on.....<br>What does this say? That girls generally go for the Bengs? Come on now....surely the picture is now clearer than that? How anyone could embrace openly the inception of such a ridiculous, under-explored Thought stumps me.<br><br>Dear Fries, having seen what girls are capable of ( I dun even wanna go into what guys are, it's way to early in the morn for that), I totally empathize with you and what you've been tru. But you're lucky, you know why? You may not have escaped unscathed, but you have your dignity and your pride still about you. You never really got dumped, you've got to understand that, cos in the first place, there was no relationship. And because you were not rejected in the traditional sense of the word, there was no need for you to go down on your knees and beg her to come back...or did you? Well....let's assume you didn't....what did you lose, 'cept for some wasted time and heartache that taught you about the vicious side of the female species, what better way to learn than to live thru it? Oh yes, the pain might feel wrenching, gut-twisting and almost death-inducing but just think, IS it really that bad now? Most things always seem a little out of focused, not as sharp when viewed in retrospect and at a distance.<br>I have begged, cried and basically tried to do everything within my ability to get the man I loved back into my life but guess what? He kicked me aside and told me that he didn't love me anymore and pls get the hell outta here or he'd be forced to hit me. Now that wasn't very gentlemanly of him but did i care then? I still loved him to death..still didn't wanna give up and said to hell with my principles, be gone thy pride, strength and girl power, I just wanted him back....so I turned myself inside out...not that it did any damn good...To cut a very long and tedius story short, what i'm trying to say is that one can only do so much to make another love you....Wait a min, this wasn't what i came here to write..dang brain's not working..okay, .i'll continue my story with you at a later date...sorry <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>Now on to more imprt things than a tattered love story, we have to get one thing straight here and that is ( as a few insightful posters have pointed out before) only the rare few prefer the company of the Bengs to..to...the rest of the world. By what yardstick are we comparing these Bengs with? The cream of the crop? The elite and chosen few among our oh-so-gracious society? The president's scholars? The ang mohs who are born here or the expatraites who work here or their gaw-jus sons? How bout the scrambler riders or the car-racers who rev their wrxs'and imagine they're in some F1 champonship? OR maybe even the much talked about Bastards.<br>Let us not mix up the Bengs and Bastards for they are of vastly different calibres and<br>physiology make-up altogether. I know I'm going off on a tangent here but bear with me just a bit longer. The point I'm trying to reach is that most girls are only looking for that special someone who can fulfil their emotional needs( most imprtly), someone they can talk to and share everything with, someone who won't mind her past or present, someone who can make her laugh( who won't think she's cheesy cos she happens to find Jim Carrey cool and Al Pacino makes her go weak at the knees), someone who understands her and her habits, albeit unhealthy and is willing to stand by her and not bolt at the slightest flaw....beginning to get the picture now? When the passion cools and the dust settles, what are you left with?<br><br>I know someone out there's gonna ask me, will I be all that that I ask for in a guy? I can only say that I will try my darndest....then again, the topic was on why certain girls like certian types of guys rite? Not on me!:Ãž<br>And someone's gonna ask me if I'm sure I dun give two hoots abt the appearance of my significant one(SO). I'm not gonna push it by saying that no I don't mind even if he's 80kg, 1.56m tall, with the smell of salted fish oozing out from every pore and with a voice that can rival that of Donald Duck's.<br>Why should I bend myself over backwards just because I believe that most girls out there honestly are looking for prince charmings who are very fallible humans, not perfect creatures as popular misconception might like one to believe. And if like one poster said, that girl finds her future in the arms of one who dresses, talks and walks like a beng, sfw, does that make him one? And does tha tmake her a lesser person because she found happiness with someone who treats her good? Gawd, what's a poor girl to do avoid being talk about and labelled here? Be a martyr?<br><br>The bottom line is that what you're able to offer on the inside is what truly matters. And no, not all pretty packages are hollow inside. Let's give credit where it's due, you have your bad eggs and you have your good ones, so who's to say that all Bengs are necessarily scum of the earth and who's to say that the decent-looking boy who's never had a gf but who's such a Mr Nice-dude wll treat a girl as perfectly as he believes he will if given the chance?<br>Also, for the posters out there who still adamantly believe that girls here prefer bengs, lemme remind you that bengs are not the only ones you're competing with, you have your gaw-jus ang mohs, your practising and non-practising lawyers, your lecturers(YES, it happens in real life too!)and hey, even your family doctor.<br>Okay now, so there are actually two very differnt spin-offs of the male species that we're going off the deep end here about, one the Bengs, and 2nd, the Bastards. Hmm.....something new evoles once every 30 years I hear tell.....what will the next one be?<br><br>p/s I know after all that I've written, I sound like I'm the umbrella that shelters all Bengs from verbal and mental abuse, on the contrary, I am very small-minded when it comes to these folks and would prefer to have as little to do with them as possible, owing to the simple fact that I would have nothing to say to them on a cellular level. And I'm talking about the real Bengs( yes, the ones who  spout a strange hokkien word at every given opportunity, who give you a blank look at the word "soulmate",and who think a good nite out would be at a noisy club where their hp/pg and all forms of telecommunication beep/ring/fart for the better part of the nite)... not the psyeudo ones..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Honey<br>#15821103<br><br>Give the good ole gals a break and they won't<br>nitpick on you too! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey guys,<br><br>Look at it this way, gals dig Ah bengs becos they want a dangerous life, u know the type where they have this Ekin look that says they have to go chop someone up cos they piss in his space....let's face it, gals now want to have fun first and they figured why tie urself to someone that looks like he is no fun to be with(fallacy here, looks are nor related to ability to have fun) but it seems gals think that way...it is only after a while that they realise that but do they learn...heck no...this is not some kind of gal bashing or anything, it is a fact, guys who do not look bengish are deemed to be marriage stuff, the guys who gals marry after they had their fun,<br><br>back to looks, why do gals like guys with good looks...well who won't? Let's face it, we guys go for pretty babes too...all that talk about character is just an excuse...first impression counts, if u can't even stand the sight of that gal or guy, u think u are gonna try to talk to them and get to know their better side...get real.<br><br>peopl ask, then how ha, some smart aleck will say get rich which I agree, rich guys get the babes, like it or not, for every gal that says that she go for character and looks and not the money, there are 100 more who will go for the money, materialistic? Slut? No!!!!, they are just being practical, in life and enjoyment, money is needed, more money means more fun....I am not saying that money equals fun but with money you can have more avenues for fun. Imagine this, out on a date, you go to your yacht and sail out into the sea...romantic, special...but no money you think got yacht....dream on...<br><br>so guys and gals, looks, money, character, they all matter but remember, you are being judged by this same standards as well...so the next time you are complaining about that guy or gal not giving a damn about your existence, ask yourself, did u do the same to someone else....that's all folks...</div>

Sad huh ?<br><br>Actually, I never wonder why I never attract the girls, I always wonder why I can't BE like those guys who attract girls....Hehe<br><br>I happen to know a list of my bad points (not that long lah !) compiled after asking close friends and buddies for 3 years ! It's not like they are unchangeable facts but mainly just small behavioural traits....I guess all in all that makes girls averse to me ?<br><br>I better not ramble on....time for dinner anyway ! See you guys !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, just like most ppl here, i just wanted to give my 2 cents worth and maybe offer a dif POV?<br>as a girl, i personally do not see the attraction other girls allegedly have for bengs. as hypocritical as it sounds, i cannot stand bengs! the definition of a "beng" is so vague, i guess ppl are bound to disagree, but for me, the main reasons why i dislike bengs ironically all stem frm their immense ego. they swagger abt orchard rd acting as if they're some demi-gods gracing us lowly commoners with their presences. being in a grp gives them an extra sense of security (i thk) and they casually pass comments/wolf whistle/blahblahblah at any girl tt walks by. i guess i may seem shallow: how many bengs do i exactly know? not many and not tt in depth to pass comments i guess. but basically i just wanted to show tt not all girls are attracted to bengs! i know most of my frens wldnt even be seen with bengs let alone become their gfs. i dont know, maybe my whole grp consists of shallow, hypocritical, immature girls?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I totally disagree bout girls being interested in bengs &amp; not SNAG or nice guys. Perhaps wat makes u think in such a way is tat u are either not looking at the right kind of girls or the girls u are looking at are not of the rite age. Anyway, wat makes u think u might not be a beng urself ? It's not tat nice guys don't last or tat they are not appreciated, rather appreciation comes along with maturity. I don't know if anyone gets wat I'm saying but if u don't, just leave it.</div>

I dun know y gers prefer to put up with guys like that.......oh i forgot to mention..he's quite a good looker....is that it??....I dun know....but I just hope that jerk dun end up breaking my good friend's heart...she'16 and he's 21 he's rich...i dun think my friend is the materialistic type i correct that...I know she isnt..but i hope something in her will tell her quickly and make her realise that the guy is just a playboy who thinks she's an easy target..<br>I think gers should look for guys their own age maybe 2 yrs older at the most? much older guys just prey on younger gers because they know it's easier for them They have the experience they have the cars...Well Let's hope he will have the heart not to toy with her feelings and then dump her...she's now telling me all guys are bad...just because of experiences like this and jerks like this...and i guess most gers will think like her ( after hearing from honey and all) but just to get one thing straight....<br>gers if u want to choose jerks like that it's your own fault! something inside there (common sense) in your subconcious would alredi tell u that those guys would cheat u of yr feelings yet u r so liberal as to give them to those very guys..<br>if u open up yr eyes a little maybe u will see that there are others out there just waiting to be discovered but they just need u to give them a chance y dun u try to get to know them and understand them better Just think about this.. and dun penalise all guys because of jerks like that... U chose them! if they ill treat u dun go around and think all guys are bad...u havent given everyone a fair chance so dun make that assumption<br><br>what i have learnt is that when good looking guys pretend to be nice, gers fall for him like I dono wat ( and they get hurt and start turning on everyone's tail)..but when ugly guys try to touch them with their sincerity they treat these guys like pests ( and to be fair to the sexes that goes the other way as well)Y can't we just open our minds and eyes a little wider and maybe our lives wouldnt be filled with narrow streets and limited choices... =P<br><br>------------------<br>"If YoU fAiL tO lOoK bEyOnD lOoKs,<br>YoU fAiL tO aPpReCiAtE tRuE bEaUtY"<br>Â© Copyright 1999 FriesÂ® All rights reserved.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Fries (edited 23-11-1999).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by Fries (edited 23-11-1999).]</div>
