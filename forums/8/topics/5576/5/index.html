            <div class='col-md body'>Reasons why girls like Ah bengs<br>(Note there are different categories of Ah bengs...I am talking about those tough Ah bengs with the kind of toughness in them.....definitely not those under 20 Ah bengs who have really nonsensical colour sense(<br>1. They can protect thegirl anytime the girl is in dire straits.<br>2. They look more cool and talk less.<br>3. They dare to do things that ppl never expect.Some girls thrive on excitement and thrill.<br>4.They are usually unconformist and do the most bizarre things that no one understands. Some girls just like the weirdest thing<br>5.They are somesort mysterious and get the attention of ppl. If they are cool-looking gals will want to more about his inner self to see what he really is<br><br>As for me, it will be good to know ppl like them..but intellect and talents as well as a mature mind attracts me better than just a cool disposition<br><br>------------------<br>We have no right to ask when sorrow comes, "Why did this happen to me?" unless we ask the same question for every moment of happiness that comes our way.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Fries, Firewire and all the rest,<br><br>This is an interesting thread, and I have been reading it. I think I should add my story, but I felt that it is told a hundred times here. I do agree with the claim that gals prefer ah bengs to nice guys. Well, with what Rinoa said, there is at least some hope for those guys who are nice and intellectual...<br><br>My 2nd ex-gf has a ex-bf who smoked and was a gangster when they were together for 2 years. Then she left him because thinking that he was immature and was two-timing her. Then when she went with me, she was in university and I was also in university and doing my masters in UK. But she went back with him and she felt that he was changed, disregarding all the bad things he had done to her.. She was seeing him and betrayed me when I was studying in overseas while I kept very hard to survive the loneliness and not dating anyone. It lowered my self-confidence for a long while. For a day, I ask myself why I being a high achiever with so much future lose to a lowly gangster, and the gal is an university undergraduate.<br><br>In the end, I come to terms and tell myself that it is not I am not good enough. Perhaps, my ex-gf never loved me, which is what I felt so hurt about the r/s, though we share so many happy and sweet moments. It reminded me about all those HK drama serials, where there are 2 guys and a gal in the story, the gal would pick the lousy jerk and not the nice guy and then the nice guy become the villain in the show... It is so true. For a while, I felt so tempted to go to the Dark side and concentrate in making lots of money to take revenge someday...but what would I get in return? I just live my life in another manner although sometimes, I feel that the situation is still the same that the gal would choose a jerk over me being the gentleman. I don't know whether it is Fate playing me to make me the villain in the end of what...<br><br>Nevertheless, I think we should not give up our principles... At least that is the dignity we have.<br><br>To all those nice guys, you have my support and I am sure that you would find someone.. I would wish you all the best..<br><br>yours<br>Prodigal<br><br>------------------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights. However, love is not about finding someone to relieve you, but love is about you devoting your heart and soul to love that someone, even if you know that someone do not love you the way you do."<br>- Prodigal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is a very touching story.....i cried while I was reading it..<br><br>My grandparents were married for over half a century, and played their<br>&gt; own<br>&gt; &gt; special game from the time they had met each other. The goal of their game<br>&gt; &gt; was to write the word "shmily" in a surprise place for the other to find.<br>&gt; &gt; They took turns leaving "shmily" around the house, and as soon as one of<br>&gt; &gt; them discovered it, it was their turn to hide it once more. They dragged<br>&gt; &gt; "shmily" with their fingers through the sugar and<br>&gt; &gt;  flour containers to await whoever was preparing the next meal. They<br>&gt; smeared<br>&gt; &gt; it in the dew on the windows overlooking the patio where my grandma always<br>&gt; &gt; fed us warm, homemade pudding with blue food coloring.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  "Shmily" was written in the steam left on the mirror after a hot shower,<br>&gt; &gt; where it would reappear bath after bath. At one point, my grandmother even<br>&gt; &gt; unrolled an entire roll of toilet paper to leave "shmily" on the very last<br>&gt; &gt; sheet.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  There was no end to the places "shmily" would pop up.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  Little notes with "shmily" scribbled hurriedly were found on dashboards<br>&gt; and<br>&gt; &gt; car seats, or taped to steering wheels. The notes were stuffed inside<br>&gt; shoes<br>&gt; &gt; and left under pillows. "Shmily" was written in the dust upon the mantel<br>&gt; and<br>&gt; &gt; traced in the ashes of the fireplace.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; This mysterious word was as much a part of my grandparents' house as the<br>&gt; &gt; furniture. It took me a long time before I was able to fully appreciate my<br>&gt; &gt; grandparents' game. Skepticism has kept me from believing in true love -<br>&gt; one<br>&gt; &gt; that is pure and enduring. However, I never doubted my grandparents'<br>&gt; &gt; relationship. They had love down pat. It was more than their flirtatious<br>&gt; &gt; little games; it was a way of life.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Their relationship was based on a devotion and passionate affection, which<br>&gt; &gt; not everyone is lucky enough to experience. Grandma and Grandpa held hands<br>&gt; &gt; every chance they could. They stole kisses as they bumped into each other<br>&gt; in<br>&gt; &gt; their tiny kitchen. They finished each other's sentences and shared the<br>&gt; &gt; daily crossword puzzle and word jumble. My grandma whispered to me about<br>&gt; how<br>&gt; &gt; cute my grandpa was, how handsome and old he had grown to be. She claimed<br>&gt; &gt; that she really knew "how to pick 'em."<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  Before every meal they bowed their heads and gave thanks, marveling at<br>&gt; &gt; their blessings: a wonderful family, good fortune, and each other.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  But there was a dark cloud in my grandparents' life: my grandmother had<br>&gt; &gt; breast cancer. The disease had first appeared ten years earlier. As<br>&gt; always,<br>&gt; &gt; Grandpa was with her every step of the way. He comforted her in their<br>&gt; yellow<br>&gt; &gt; room, painted that way so that she could always be surrounded by sunshine,<br>&gt; &gt; even when she was too sick to go outside.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  Now the cancer was again attacking her body. With the help of a cane and<br>&gt; my<br>&gt; &gt; grandfather's steady hand, they went to church every morning. But my<br>&gt; &gt; grandmother grew steadily weaker until, finally, she could not leave the<br>&gt; &gt; house anymore. For a while, Grandpa would go to church alone, praying to<br>&gt; God<br>&gt; &gt; to watch over his wife.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  Then one day, what we all dreaded finally happened. Grandma was gone.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  "Shmily." It was scrawled in yellow on the pink ribbons of my<br>&gt; grandmother's<br>&gt; &gt; funeral bouquet. As the crowd thinned and the last mourners turned to<br>&gt; leave,<br>&gt; &gt; my aunts, uncles, cousins and other family members came forward and<br>&gt; gathered<br>&gt; &gt; around Grandma one last time.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  Grandpa stepped up to my grandmother's casket and, taking a shaky breath,<br>&gt; &gt; he began to sing to her. Through his tears and grief, the song came, a<br>&gt; deep<br>&gt; &gt; and throaty lullaby.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  Shaking with my own sorrow, I will never forget that moment.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  For I knew that, although I couldn't begin to fathom the depth of their<br>&gt; &gt; love, I had been privileged to witness its unmatched beauty.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  S-h-m-i-l-y:<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  See How Much I Love You.<br><br>------------------<br>"If YoU fAiL tO lOoK bEyOnD lOoKs,<br>YoU fAiL tO aPpReCiAtE tRuE bEaUtY"<br>Â© Copyright 1999 FriesÂ® All rights reserved.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Do you ever realise that there are six billion people out there but most probably only one that is willing and able to spend the rest of his/her short miserable life suffering with you and for you for the sake of "love"?<br>Anyway, I digress. Back to the question. I have never been involved in any relationship, so I unfortunately do not have any sad stories to contribute. But amongst the couples I know, the guys are pretty decent stuff. I can't specifically say whether or why girls like bengs better, but maybe it's because of some rougish charm which bengs possess?<br>Whether you're a beng or nice guy, what matters is finding that one in six billion person. There's no reason why you can't succeed if you keep on trying. Many have managed to do so. Therefore have courage my friend, go forth on your quest for true love and happiness...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
