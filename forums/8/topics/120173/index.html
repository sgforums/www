This made Serene even more uncomfortable.  But since Desiree has already moved in, how are they going to tell her to move out?  They were both Desiree's friends.

It is obvious Serene no longer treats D like her friend, and is far more concerned about herself and what she may lose, rather than work together with Mark to help salvage D's relationship and life. If serene put aside her own jealousy to help D, perhaps Mark would be touched at her self-lessness.
