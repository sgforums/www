            <div class='col-md body'>Exactly, the movies which are earning the most bucks are the usual Hollywood blockbuster PG-13 (LOTR, Harry Potter, Spiderman). R(A) movie producers are in fact taking a huge risk since their potential revenue from "below-21s" is almost nonexistant. When you look at the big picture, gross-revenue is pretty much secondary in R(A) category.<br></div>
