              <p>I find this 2 countries humanitarian responses to the EarthQuake in Haiti is a disgrace......Tiger wood alone donate 3 millions more than the countries combine!!!!</p>
              <p>The Singapore government said on Thursday that it will make a contribution of 50,000 U.S. dollars in support of the international community's humanitarian relief efforts for earthquake-hit Haiti.</p>
              <p>China's RED CROSS (a non profit organization) is donating $1 million. they send a plane of relief worker with Chinese Flag...but only contribute $1 million from a country with world largerest foreign reserved.</p>

              <p>To Add:</p>
              <p>I think Sg govt should act to send resecue team at the begining of the event.</p>
              <p>If SAF can mounted complex military excerise overseas why can't the Govt gear up for a much smaller relief team.</p>
              <p>I also think that there are similarity between SG and Haiti given that both are Island with limited resources and concrete building provide good learning curve on diseater relief from our Total civil defence organization.</p>

              I partly agreed a disgrace for Sg's $50,000/ but China's $1 million should be ok.   None of the rich middle-east countries have pledged for funds or they are doing it quietly.   Nevertheless, from past pledges for donations, most countries only lip-service but actually do not give .   Just publicity stunt. 
              I applaud USA which is always quick to provide assistance in food and manpower.

              <p>The Singapore government said on Thursday that it will make a contribution of 50,000 U.S. dollars in support of the international community's humanitarian relief efforts for earthquake-hit Haiti.</p>
              <p>China's RED CROSS (a non profit organization) is donating $1 million. they send a plane of relief worker with Chinese Flag...but only contribute $1 million from a country with world largerest foreign reserved.</p>

              <p>In any case the Port Crane in Haiti has collasped and that the effective way to enter is thru the airport but the supplied of Jet fuel has ceased as such the only way is for flight to carry enough fuel for round trip....that limit the abilities to allow international flight into Haiti....</p>
