            <div class='col-md body'>I am writing in response to Paul Chan Boon Cheow's letter entitled "DBS website needed plug-ins, but unavailable", published on 1st August 2002.<br><br>Firstly I would like to mention that I do know that Microsoft has made the "Java virtual machine" download unavailable, but this was not due to vulnerabilities present in the software. A completely secure piece of code written for a program is almost as elusive as a 100% successful peace treaty. Most people who frequently use the Internet and computers in general, know that it is common knowledge that no software can be completely "secure" and free from exploits. The game of catch-up played by malicious computer crackers and software engineers will always be going on. Take note that Microsoft's, and even the Pentagon's websites have been successfully cracked and vadalized by malicious crackers numerous times.<br><br>Next and more importantly, I did not find any information in the related documentation provided, which point to vulnerabilities as the reason for Microsoft making the software unvailable for download. Rather, as stated plain and simple on the home page for Microsoft Technologies for Java, this is merely the outcome of an agreement that Microsoft has reached with Sun<br>Microsystems to settle the October 1997 lawsuit filed by Sun Microsystems, and Microsoft's counter suit, all of which was due to a disagreement over the Java technology license agreement between both companies.<br><br>How Mr Chan came to the conclusion that vulnerabilities was the sole reason for Microsoft making the plug-in for web browsers unavailable is beyond me. Contrary to what Mr Chan mentioned, Microsoft did not pull all versions of this software off its website, and neither has Java received the "stamp of disapproval" due to vulnerabilities from Microsoft. SDK developer kits and Debug Classes are still readily available for download from the website.<br><br>Mr Chan's concerns over DBS solving the problem by requiring clients to buy virus scanners and firewalls are also unfounded, and caused mostly by misconceptions or the lack of knowledge of how computers work. Any vulnerabilities in the Java plug-in, are due to loopholes in the code, and using firewalls and anti-virus programs will not help the problem one bit. This is completely irrelevant to DBS asking clients to ensure their computers are secure by installing firewalls or anti-virus programs, since the reason those clients had their funds stolen was due to a lack of security on their part, and not due to the Java plug-in.<br><br>I do not wish to flog a dead horse, but the recent fraud case involving DBS, was due entirely to clients failing to ensure their computers which contained their passwords and account numbers were secure. Blaming DBS for their lack of responsibility is akin to them leaving their chequebooks and account numbers, etc, lying around their houses unlocked, and blaming DBS when a burglar breaks into the house and steals the above items and uses them to withdraw funds.<br><br>Having said all that I have to say regarding Mr Chan's letter, I think what alarms and concerns me most at the same time most is the rate at which misinformation, myths, and lies are spread about the Internet and computers in general, all of which are due to a basic lack of understanding of how computers work.<br><br>In conclusion, I personally feel that it is not right that DBS has had to take the fall for the mistakes of its own clients when the blame should rest solely on the shoulders of the individuals involved. The onus of keeping their computers secure is on the clients, not DBS, and spreading more lies and myths about computers and Internet security is not going to help the matter at all. I hope my reply has put to rest Mr Chan's concerns, and hopefully educated the general public more about IT in general. If anything, I hope this might prevent further incidents like the DBS fraud case from ever happening again, as no one except the perpetrator stands to gain anything.</div>
