I won't do that if i were him. Wat feeling to talk abt when u can't even communicate properly? Strange. Maybe if the objective is getting the bed warm, then by all means. but certainly not for me. i believe in sg girls, as most of us are at least 3rd generation Singaporean oredi. and having said that, i guess most of us have something in common - to certain extend. e.g, when talk abt certain topics such as secondary school experiences, events etc with your wife, things get understand almost immediately. or in some occassion when u were talking abt things with ur fren, ur wife will understand and not be left out. at least they can comprehend there's such thing as 'reservist' and nationa service etc...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I could imagine how hard it is for viet bride to accept this...<br><br>Kind of like 'human trafficking' isn't?..... just my 2 cents worth  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div></blockquote>yah nt for me, prefer 'locally made'.
