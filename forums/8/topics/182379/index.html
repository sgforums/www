I have friends from different countries, and I truly believe them when they said they worked alongside singaporeans who complain at the slightest inconvenience. Most singaporeans have not encountered true hardships before, and they will probably not appreciate the wonderful things they already have until maybe one day they lose all that. And most ang moh friends that I know of, they were living on their own by the age of like 20, and in singapore, when you're 20 you're more likely still holding out the hand and taking money from parents.</div>
