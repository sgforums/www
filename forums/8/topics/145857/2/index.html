            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by MrBach:</div><div class="quote_body">The child should be released from prison once it is born.<br><br>It's only fair to imprison the child along with its mother, so long as it the case that the imprisonment of its mother isn't going to add anything over and above what it is already experiencing by being confined to its mother's womb; otherwise, the imprisonment of the mother would force the child to partake of its mother's punishment in a more direct fashion and in a way which would cause it to experience something over and above what it is already experiencing by existing within its mother's womb.<br><br>The answer is clear: once the child is born, there is no reason not to liberate it from the cell in which its mother has been incarcerated.<br><br>Good question, Fugue, and don't worry about the guy who made some stab at stealing your thunder.<br><br>He failed miserably.<br><br>Ben<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think if i am not wrong, she can ask for suspended sentence until the child is borned.<br><br>there are previous cases of such incidents.<br><br>Anyway in singapore prison , her condition will be under medical care type situation and most probably very light duty.<br><br>They will make provision for her condition.<br><br></div>
