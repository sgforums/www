            <div class='col-md body'>Looking ahead down the stretch of Orchard Road with its Christmas trimmings gleaming and bouncing off streaks of lights, the whole place was teeming with activites.. Yet, as I started to walk slowly, along the pavement, I couldnÂ’t help feeling I was caught up in my own dazed bubble, set apart from all the dash and rush that was going on around me.. Even the Jingle Bells blaring from the loudspeakers overhead came through to me in a muted fashion as I caught snatches of it through my bubble..<br><br>It's been a long time since I walk down the stretch of Orchard Road.. everything is still in place, I recalled the times when I was working part-time in a Mac-donald when I was just a student, life was slow and free back then.. It's cruel how time files.. I would have no qualms about shortening my life-span if time could reverse..<br><br>I looked at my bank balance.. I would need that for house payment and groceries, not forgetting shasha fees which had to be submitted by the next morning.. And what about next month and the next? The job market was getting tighter each day.. Would I be able to get a new job soon? What about all the payments to be made, what about the daily expenses, what about shasha's Christmas gift?<br><br>Maybe I should just break-off with shasha.. how should I tell her? that I don't love her anymore? No.. she won't believe me.. she knows how much I love her.. But, I am broke.. how can I let her suffer with me.. Arrgg.. I felt so useless..<br><br>I couldnÂ’t afford the big houses and flashy cars that my peers owned, but at least I could get my girl the clothes others girls had.. I knew in a way that I was being silly, yet that had made me feel better.. That was why I felt obligated to buy shasha whatever she wanted..<br><br>I walked into my favourite snack bar in suntec, and sat down near to the counter as all the seats were taken.. it was lunch time and I count my lucky stars beneath my breath..I picked up a menu and began to look at the various items trying to decide if I wanted to order breakfast as I did not have anything the whole morning or just go ahead and eat lunch..<br><br>From the corner of my eyes, something familiar lures me.. Even from a distance I was aware that she was different from other women in the bar.. she was with a companion.. a man old enough to be her father.. yet the action of her doesn't justify that, in fact she feels so comfortable with him that every torch was like flirting.. I am glad shasha was not like that, but even if she is, what can I do? I can't provide for her.. there will be no happiness with someone as poor as me..<br><br>I finally decided to order my lunch and a cup of hot coffee.. I sat there continually racking my brain trying to find a solution to my situation.. In the midst of my lightheaded rambling I steal a second glance at that stunningly beautiful young girl.. She wore a loose floral mini dress with shoulder straps and flip-flops.. She had a delicate, slim figure with beautiful curves and smooth snowry white skin.. She looked graceful and innocent just like shasha..<br><br>At that moment, she turned towards my direction.. The movement of her eyes as she wander around is unmistakable; that momentary second look.. I know that look.. she's shasha..<br><br></div>
