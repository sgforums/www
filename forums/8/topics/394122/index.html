              <p>I've completed my O's in 2009 and now currently in YJC. But now I dont want to continue JC anymore, but even the poly admission (appeal case) has ended already. So means the only choice is to wait till next year then maybe i choose either poly or other school i want ? I was thinking about private school, but i received alot of negative comments about studying in private school from friends, parents of course. Is it that bad ?</p>
              <p>If im going to wait till next year, maybe i can find some jobs to do ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So is this a good idea ? Please give me all your opinions and advice. Tyvm :D</p>

              <p>unless you really feel that you cannot cope with the rigours of the A levels, then perhaps it will be better for you to switch school.</p>
              <p>but you shouldn't have the mindset that poly or private schools will have lower workload than jc.</p>
              <p>in poly, wad you study might be simpler, but you have a continuous 3 yr academic assessment. not unlike A lvls which you only have to fare well for 1 single exam. it will be like O lvl all over again.</p>
              <p>and as for private schools, it is much much more costly, for those who are desperate and are will to pay for higher education. and also bear in mind that they are not well recognise in singapore. try comparing NUS/NTU etc degrees with degree from university of tasmania, wollongong etc. same applies for diplomas.</p>
              <p>not to say they are not recognised at all, but they are considered sort of inferior.</p>
              <p><br>and MDIS-issued diplomas are useless and not recognised. it is used by MDIS to qualify you for their degree programs.</p>

              <p>yes i feel that i cannot cope with the subjects. and also dont know why, only now i feel that maybe studying the JC subjects is not really my interest after all. sometimes i feel that i only study for the sake of studying. but actually im quite lazy also, i think i dont study at all. anyway is it not good to go to poly ? then why nowadays still got so many people even with good scores opting for a poly than JC ?</p>

              <p>only around 30% of uni places are for poly grads.</p>
              <p>there is a much lower chance of you entering local uni as a poly
              grad. gpa of 3.5 is the minimum for admission.</p>
              <p>and as poly grad, it is close to impossible for you to be
              admitted to prestigious courses such as medicine, law and
              dentistry.</p>
              <p>scholarships are also commonly awarded to A level holders.</p>

              <p>no, I'm a full time engineer with uni degree and part time A level tutor.</p>
              <p>And I have poly grads working under me... and I can see that although they are more experienced than me having worked more years, they are still limited by their degree and not allowed to rise beyond the rank of engineering assistants...</p>

              <p>got. but very very limited. rare.</p>
              <p>i still remember that it made headlines when 2 poly grads were admitted into medicine.</p>
              <p>and to TS, dun think poly is slack. yes, you can graduate with a pass grade. but to hope to progress to uni, you will need gpa of 3.5. that means 3 yrs of consistent hardwork, getting average of A from yr 1 to yr3. can you withstand the 'marathon'?</p>
              <p>plenty of distractions around too. girls, gaming, truancy. etc.</p>
              <p>i have plenty of friends who either played too much in yr1 , or lose interest in yr3, ending up with screwed up gpa, and ended up not even able to qualify for private degree.</p>
