              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>
              </span></p><p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>hi! i am here to help too. let help you weigh the pros and cons of all 3 educations:</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>A levels- the lowest of the 3, as in the command of salary when u juz begin working should b $1300-$1500. of course the most direct entry to uni, most ppl in uni is from jc. the big BUT...what if u did not obtain the certain grades that is needed to go to the course u want? of course u still can go if ur grades ain't as good...but there is a risk that u will be stuck with juz a-levels.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Poly- the lowest form of tertiary education, command of salary in the beginning is from $1500-$1700. but as u can c it is more recognised than a levels. now for tertiary education, u should have some form of idea of what field of work u wan in the future, so u can decide which course u wan to take. business, science, engineering, IT, etc?</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Uni- loweset will be juz the normal degree. starting pay will be $1900-$2100 odd. of course it is much more recognised than the other 2. but now there are so many ppl with degrees, it bcomes like a "norm" to have, haha, no pressure here. but my advice if u ever reach this stage is that u MUZ consider what u want to specialise in.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>so...to your problem. perhaps u feel kinna left out in sch, which in turns affect your mood to work hard? poly will be similar too, coz u have u work in groups in project work. so when u work in your project groups, why not try to join in the groups conversations and perhaps u can make more friends from the simple gesture?</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>if u could go to a jc in the first place, that means u r quite bright rite? get tuition for youur weak subjects. if u still feel that u cannot cope, talk to your form teacher to change to subjects u think u can do better for your a levels. of course the advantage of choosing the jc route is that not only the most direct and easiest form of entry to uni, but the no of years to complete is shorter, taking to account that u have ns as well.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>if u think u really can cope after trying what i suggested, then u can choose the poly route. but bear in mind that 2 yrs is wasted and only the top 5-10% can go to local uni. but this is not the end, coz there r quite some people out there who take up private degrees after that, like from SIM. i will say that poly lifestyle is more laxed. that's y those very smart ppl can afford to choose the poly route, knowing that they are so smart, will then be considered as the top 5% and proceed to uni. then rest, the not as smart ones have no chance to enter uni. (yes, i am a poly grad).</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>if u choose the poly route, while waiting for the next entry, u can work...using ur pianist abilities or get a regular job. oso to think what u wan to specialise in. my advice is not to take any private studies now as they are not as recognised (meaning will be harder to find a job). private degrees (must choose the correct ones) are better.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>and u noe what? i still think that it is best that u have a heart to heart talk with ur parents. their support is the best courage u will ever have. but of course, the decision has to make only by ur own.</span></p>

              <p>Hey there! I too have difficulties in adapting in JC, the tons
              of workloas the PW, the sarcastic teachers whom never stop to pick
              on students with their vicious scarcasm and hurtful comments,
              currently in JC1 and I'm already feeling the waves of stress that
              bound to engulf the lifes of a JC student. MADNESS!! HELP ME OUT
              PEOPLE !</p>

              <p>Agree with Bear.</p>
              <p>Wait till you step into society.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was chatting with my gf that day, and she mentioned why some students just like to take the easy way out and refuse to work hard. They used the reason that there are many rich people who didn't do well in school, so there's no point for them to do well. In fact, just like what I see in SgF last time, many rich dreamers wannabes (esp in MLM thread) say things on passive income, and how they like MLM because they can have many sidelines, etc etc... To me, this is just BS.</p>
              <p>Hard work is a necessity to succeed. If you can't even go through and survive JC, how are you going to survive the stress of life? I haven't reach that stage yet, but I can imagine... the stress that will be coming when marriage, honeymoon, and babies come into the picture......</p>
              <p>Do you think you can really flunk school and go up and set up a business empire just like that?</p>
              <p>Enough of my ranting. Bottomline: this is a good opportunity for JC students to learn to manage stress. Tenacity, determination, are personal characters that you would want to strengthen.</p>

              <p>Study in private school also good. It's fast and also not so costly. You are singaporean. the tuition fee only half of international student. You faster get a degree and find a job to get more experience. That's better than those who spend 4-5 years in goverment uni. And they still consider as fresh graduate  as private school students to employers.</p>
              <p>My friend who is older than me by 9 years, studied in private school too. She is now working in MMC company. Salary's more than 7K per months. She ever told me "it's not the matter good or bad school, it's about your attitude toward it and what you want after you graduate. Most of the thing you learn will not help you much but experience is the issue you need to worry about".</p>
              <p>You can take a look of this school (<a href="http://www.tuc-edu.com">www.tuc-edu.com</a>) . It's not too bad. And if you apply into it. I can help you get back 10% of the tuition fee. Contact me if you need : 84274751 (Miley)</p>
