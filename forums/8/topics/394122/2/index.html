              <p>Hi Fangping 19,</p>
              <p>I'm also from a JC in the north. Just a year ago, I was in the exact situation that you are in now. After completing my 'O' levels, I was distraught as I did not make it into the JC that I wanted to go to. Personally, my ambition is to become an entrepreneur and I failed to see the point of school in helping me with my aim. School was just torture as I could not click with my classmates and my grades fell greatly. This whole situation coupled with a few personal factors led to me falling into depression, eventually I had to see a psychiatrist. I contemplated leaving school like you. After speaking to many people, I realised that many of them have many opinions but what matters is that you have to factor in their opinions and, based on these opinions, make your own choice.</p>
              <p>Do not make a hasty decision. After much consideration, I decided to stay in school. Why? I felt that I could use the A levels as a backup just in case my business failed and I could still have options. You mentioned that you are a pianist. That's great and that's a talent I would love to have. However, you have to ask yourself whether you can envisage yourself teaching the piano for the rest of your life? Sure, an O level certificate can get you into some jobs but are these the jobs that you want?</p>
              <p>I would advise you to stay in school for even if you hate studying, bearing with it for these two years will reap you great benefits in the future. I think this is what people call delayed gratification. JC life passes really fast (I can't even believe that I'm in year 2 now with a few more months to go) and you'll find yourself out in no time, trust me. Alternatively, to pass time, try to have some activities to look forward to in the week. For myself, I look forward to playing basketball with my friends every friday and that keeps me going throughout the week. Think about what interests you and look for activities that satisfy your interest and time will fly by.</p>
              <p>However, I also think that a poly education is good. There are various opportunities for you to expand your horizons and you'll meet all sorts of people. It all comes down to your interests. Don't be swayed by what others say. Find out things by yourself and see them yourself. Whether it is poly, JC or a private school, the key is to continue your education at this stage of your life. There are really many options for further education that not many students know of. Go check these options out. </p>
              <p>Tough times will pass. In your case, there really isn't any wrong or right choice. Just because JC is right for someone does not mean that its right for all. Same for poly as well. Whatever choice you make, I'm sure that your friends and family will respect your decision.</p>
              <p>The above is my advice to you. Sorry its a little long. :D All the best!</p>

              <p>And so far, I haven't seen much poly grads getting first class honours in NUS... Not because they aren't smart... it's because of the way the course is structured for them.... I have typed out my considerations and reasons long ago, too lazy to type them out again.</p>

              <p>But I can say for sure that in my graduating 
                  batch for
                                          engineering, none of the poly pple got 1st class
                   honours or are on
                                          the path to getting one. In addition, none of 
                  them got the
                                          innovation and research award for their final 
                  year projects. All
                                          were from JCs. I'm pretty sure is because when 
                  the time they have
                                          in uni is too tight. No matter how you plan your
                   modules, it is
                                          almost impossible for them to embark on 
                  programmes like what I have
                                          done, just because I have 4 years and they have 3
                   years.</p>
              <p>Personal experience is, yes, for projects 
                  that requires hands
                                          on, for the hands on section, the poly students 
                  win hands down. But
                                          these projects require analysis too, and in the 
                  end, for one of the
                                          projects, the poly students built a very solid 
                  structure, but was
                                          too big to do a figure 8 as required by the 
                  module. The programming
                                          and the algorithms were also not done 
                  properly... At the uni level,
                                          the analysis to make the structure to run is 
                  much more important.
                                          In the workplace, it will be you who will be 
                  coming up with the
                                          plan; you will then command those under you to 
                  build it, not
                                          you.</p>
              <p>There are also things that were taught in A 
                  levels, and retaught
                                          in first year uni. For poly intake, they did not
                   learn it in poly,
                                          and being able to skip most of the modules in 
                  the first year, they
                                          did not get to learn too. In the end, in the 4th
                   year, they lose
                                          out.</p>
              <p>So, no matter a dip-degree route or a 
                  Alvl-degree route, just
                                          think... The Alvl-degree route results in an easier to get 1st 
                  class honours or
                                          2nd upper with enrichment programmes like 
                  industrial attachments
                                          done (of course not every one la... too many A 
                  lvl students as
                                          compared to poly students), compared to a 
                  dip-degree route, which
                                          is harder to get a 1st class honours or 2nd 
                  upper <span style="text-decoration: underline;">mainly due to
                                          lack of time.</span></p>
              <p>Then again, a cert is mainly used for 
                  employment. If you are not
                                          seeking one in the long term, but using it 
                  merely as a form of
                                          education, a form of investing in yourself, a 
                  step/passport to the
                                          working world, then it doesn't matter as much.</p>

              <p>eagle, why time in university for poly students is lesser than alvl grads ? i totally dont understand.</p>
              <p>okay you mentioned that you are a full time engineer, then poly students can at most be assistants, but in working world, dont the boss ask them to take up some other training course to upgrade themselves ? then those poly students can have higher ranks ?</p>
              <p>btw are you a jc student or poly student last time ?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Poly grads at my workplace do almost the same job at times when they have sufficient experience, but they are paid lesser. Sure, there's training courses to upgrade, but they still will not be able to attain the rank of an engineer because they don't have a uni degree.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sometimes in life, don't look at things at this current instant... Look at it from the future. What do you want? Do you want to give up one year of your life just because you are not taking active steps to reduce your stress levels or solve your problems now? Since you are already in, why not make the best of what you have now?</p>
              <p>Think about it, this is a training on your life, your ability to handle stress, handle difficulties, a test in life on your tenacity and perserverance. Success will be all the sweeter when you have finished and completed this difficult and challenging path at the end.</p>
              <p>The key is you must work hard... very hard... be ready to sacrifice your personal time... Nothing in this world comes for free; there's no free lunch. If you can't succeed here, what makes you think poly life would be any easier?</p>

              <p>That's because poly is three years long, and they may do a small part of the uni syllabus in poly. So they have the option to skip the first year of uni if their course of study is relevant.</p>
              <p>That said, poly grads usually (from my observation) tend to perform poorly in uni. And like it or not, many of the private unis in Singapore do not really match NUS/NTU/SMU in standards.</p>
              <p>Anyway, like I said, wherever it is that you go, a good mindset and a willingness to work hard is crucial to success. If you're going to be just as lazy in poly as you are in JC, then poly will be a total waste of time as well.</p>

              <p>I think all you need is an attitude change or a wake-up call.</p>
              <p>I may sound harsh, but I'm in my first year of junior college (north zone) as well, and everything you mentioned in your first post, I can relate to (not making it to my preferred JC, maths is tough etc).</p>
              <p>Snap out of your self-pity. If you can't even handle the first year of JC life, you won't survive in poly or university, and you might just end up as a failure in life. And I'm sure that's not what you want to be.</p>
              <p>So quit complaining that life's unfair, life is tough, life is competetive. Whatever. We're all going through the same thing, it's not just you.</p>

              <p>It is not a bad idea only if you know where you want to move on from here. If you don't, and is quitting only because you do not like JC life, then I will say it is a very bad idea.</p>
              <p>Some of those who leave school decided to take up a part-time job for the moment, and ended up with the job for a few years, only to regret later.</p>
              <p>Anyway, as someone has mentioned, you will still need to go for NS (If you are a guy). It is not exactly the best of decisions to go for NS first before studying in poly or private institutes.</p>
              <p>Private institutes are not exactly bad, but most of their certs and diplomas are not as recognised as those from local polys and JCs. This alone will affect your future career life. Hence, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PLEASE</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> think carefully before you make any rash decisions.</span></strong></p>
