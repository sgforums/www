            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Lecturer quits job after posting nude photos on the Net </strong><br><br><img src="http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2004-03-07/jybold-101602.jpg"><br><br>NON-CONSTITUENCY MP Steve Chia has his private collection of nude self-portraits.<br><br>This Guangzhou university lecturer has hers, too. Only, it's not so private. And it's made her quit her job.<br><br>On the Internet, she is known as Zhuying Qingtong.<br><br>She is beautiful. And bold.<br><br>She has been posting nude photos of herself on her personal online blog website since Jan 5.<br><br>Within a week of her launch, her site registered more than 130,000 hits. By last Wednesday there were more than 2.2 million hits.<br><br>Her head has been cropped out of all the nude photographs. Some of the photos look artistic, a few are provocative, and others are just plain racy.<br><br><img src="http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2004-03-07/jybold-094512.jpg"><br><br>There was one with her posing topless, hugging a Bible to her chest.<br><br>Another was of her naked, with only an electric guitar strung across her trunk. And yet another with just a palm leaf over her nude body.<br><br>She goes by the pen name - Zhuying Qingtong - a literal translation of 'bamboo shadow green pupil'.<br><br><img src="http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2004-03-07/jybold-105912.jpg"><br><br>That name has since appeared in newspapers in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, with her pictures splashed over the pages.<br><br>The attention led to her quitting her job as a lecturer in Chinese literature at a university in Guangzhou two weeks ago, Miss Qingtong told The New Paper on Sunday.<br><br>And she blames the media. 'If not for the media, I wouldn't have had to quit my job before I've really made my mark in Chinese literature,' said the long-haired Chinese beauty in an Internet interview.<br><br>'My superiors have been aware that I've posted my literary works on my blog site and they never intervened because it's what I do outside the university.<br><br>'But after the media broke the news, I faced a lot of pressure. As a lecturer in the university, my actions were not in accordance to society's expectations of a teacher.'<br><br>So why did she post her nude self-portraits on the Internet, knowing its reach?<br><br>'It's a long story. I'll explain, but only those readers who can understand me will understand my explanation,' she replied in Mandarin.<br><br>'I was curious about my body.'<br><br><img src="http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2004-03-07/JYBOLD-105845.jpg"><br><br>'When I took my own nude pictures, my body looked alien to me. But I thought my body was beautiful.<br><br>'I wanted readers to read my beautiful essays and admire my beautiful body.<br><br>'I also made it a point to crop the nude pictures in a way that my head is not shown.'<br><br>'I wanted readers to think that the nudity in the picture could be any woman's, and that the human body is an amazing subject,' added the Fujian-born woman, who plans to publish her books.<br><br>She noted that posting nude photos of herself is something that not many people can accept.<br><br>'But more and more people in China are coming to terms with what I did,' she said.<br><br>'If I were in America, I would probably be doing something else. Every society has its restrictions. Different people observe different customs and have different perspectives.<br><br>'But I'm glad these are changing. You can say I am the new generation of Chinese.'<br><br>Despite the media attention and the loss of her job, Miss Qingtong has no regrets.<br><br>She declined to disclose her last-drawn salary. Anyway, she said, she sees the loss of her job as a blessing in disguise, as she now has more time to concentrate on her writing.<br><br>'I'll probably look for another job soon, but in the meantime, I'm living my life on words,' she said. 'I don't spend a lot of money as I don't often go shopping. I spend the bulk of my time writing.'<br><br>She added that her family does not know that she is the infamous Zhuying Qingtong.<br><br>'Even if they were to find out later, I don't think they would react strongly as they have always shown respect for me, and for the things I do,' she said.<br><br>She declined to elaborate on her family background or reveal her age, but would only say that she graduated from university in 2001 and is currently single.<br><br>'Not many students I teach know I'm Zhuying Qingtong and I don't get recognised on the streets,' she said.<br><br>When The New Paper on Sunday checked out her blog site last week, the nude pictures had already been removed by the administrator of the website.<br><br>But there were many lewd messages left by those who visited her site.<br><br>Miss Qingtong said: 'Readers are free to voice their opinions on the Internet. But I'm just disappointed with their humanity.'<br><br>She added that she was also disappointed with the media for angling reports on her nude self-portraits instead of her literary works.<br><br>'I don't want my fame in this way (referring to her nude pictures). I've written poems, essays and novels up to 400,000 words. But the media chooses to report on my nude pictures instead.'<br><br>Her literary works have been on the website since February last year, but she caught the Internet community's attention only after she posted her nude self-portraits on her blog site.<br><br>'My nude pictures may not be artistically taken, but they're not porn,' insisted Miss Qingtong.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>Reactions from media </strong><br><br>HONG KONG-BASED Phoenix TV called her actions 'Bold moves on the Internet'.<br><br>The headlines of Nanfang Daily screamed: 'Literary works and nude self-portraits, Zhuying Qingtong bared it all for her works'.<br><br>In Hong Kong, The Apply Daily newspaper's headlines, read: 'Female lecturer posts nude pictures on her site every day'. There was also a report in Hong Kong's English-language broadsheet, the South China Morning Post.<br><br><strong>OVERNIGHT FAME </strong><br><br>But while Miss Qingtong gained overnight fame (or notoriety), her actions have resulted in a backlash from the more conservative Chinese.<br><br>In an interview with The New Paper on Sunday, Miss Qingtong acknowledged that what she has done is generally not acceptable to society, especially as she was a lecturer.<br><br>But she is not fazed by the criticism, nor the lewd messages left on her blog by those who visit it.<br><br>One of her readers wrote: 'Your breasts are more beautiful than your face.'<br><br>Some have told her to stop, though.<br><br>One reader, who thinks her actions are shameful, wrote: 'How can you look people in the face in future?'<br><br>Zhuying Qingtong also has fans who continue to visit her website even though her nude photographs have been removed.<br><br>Mr Peter Law from Canada, said: 'It would be a crime to stop your writing because of the social stigma. I'm all for freedom of expression. Keep up your good work.'<br></div>
