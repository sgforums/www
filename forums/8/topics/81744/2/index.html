            <div class='col-md body'>well talking about recent one, I went for a show yesterday Monday afternoon. Not many people watching "the day after tomorrow". Estimation was about  26-30 people watching. Wow I guess it's great..less people less troublesome.<br><br>When I found my seat, I saw this teenage guy with three gals sitting in a row behind me. What caught my attention was the guy's feet was placed on the armchair I was suppose to sit. Heheh I looked at him to signal " Hello, excuse me...your foot please...". He knew that I look at him and he removed his foot.<br><br>During the previews, the gals were chatting all the way..well I thought they wont be chatting when the movie started. I was wrong.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> .. They were like mind their own business attitude.!! gosh..What irritated me most was the smell of the Hong kong feet , my guess was from this guy. Oh my..it's torturing..the smell was not strong. just soft...could smell it during the show , somtimes it came and off. I did not understand how the gals could watch with his smelly feet.<br><br>I moved away from the center seat to the right...noticed there were family with a young kid.. gosh he wasn't watching..he was playing with his toy!! toy like a star wars' saber sword and he wandered about until I had to shooed him off!! The parents did nothing at all and could not care about the mischevious son. What a waste of time n money..sigh</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Incidents such as this are no longer isolated.<br><br>This reminds me of the lawyer who ticked off a young man for using his cell phone in the cinema and guess what? he had the shit beaten outta him by that upstart and two of his associates. It's ppl like these who should be thrown in a cell to contemplate.<br><br>I admire the lawyer for standing up for what he believes is right. Sadly, i dare say he is a minority in Singapore. Not too long ago, i suffered a similar incident when the guy sitting next to me was talking abt soccer bets on his cell phone in the middle of a show. I told him to talk outside if he wanted to carry on. Instead he challenged me and cooked up a big fuss.<br><br>If my gf didn't pull me back, i have have landed in jail for assaulting him. Not only did he refuse to stop talking after that, he did so on and off throughout the show. His lady fren next to him simply didn't care abt his chatter.<br><br>Seriously, our society lacks courtesy and respect for others. They dun like being told off, nor do they 'realise' that they're in the wrong.<br><br>In cases like this, all it takes is for onlookers to stop minding their own business and ganging up on the culprit. I doubt he'd try his defiance further.<br><br>Unfortunately, in my own pragmatic view, Singaporeans are not prepared to get involved for fear of reprecussions.<br></div>
