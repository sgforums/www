            <div class='col-md body'>maybe li-ao should say singaporean are not as clever in social terms than pple from HK, China n TW. Sporean are by nature a simple lot, naive and not too complicated, easy to read like a book and understand. it's nv a challenge to decipher singaporean and their mindset. his definition of stupid is like saying, u guys are not smart-ass enough.  to be fair, also look the roots of modern singaporean, many of the ancestors came here dirt poor, uneducated, and from the lowest strata of the society. what culture can they bring along to pass on their offspring if they themselves are not exposed to it. they cant even write or read a single word. hence they name themselve "dog, pig, luck and money"... very crude, very low-class. just look at some of the old names.<br><br>there's nothing of a cultural asset to be proud of, coz there is none or little to begin with. if yr stomach are hungry, do u care for poems and prose. hence he said the stock here is of inferior nature. i kinda agree. it is a truth that hurts, so pple here will get angry. but the new generation has evolved, but also become too mixed in blood and mindset. kinda yucky i feel.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The authentic Taiwanese are barbarians leaving in mountains. The early migrants fleeting to Taiwan are losers that loss civil wars to the communists in China. The make up of their whole business and political communities are gangsters, taking laws in their own hands. LIAO is one of them, so lovable.</div>
