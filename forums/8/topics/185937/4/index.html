We are stupid because of our forefathers, our 'zhong' is not good.<br><br>But I find this very funny. Firstly, our forefathers came from all parts of the world before WWII, but a large number of them came from<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> China. And at that point of time, KuoMinTang (KMT), the first ruling party of Taiwan, was in control of China. </span><br><br>KMT could not even defeat the CCP despite years of trying and aids from USA. They fail to drive out the Japanese forces when they attacked ManchuKuo either. Corruption, bullies, warlords were everywhere under their control. Finally...they were badly crushed and humiliated by the CCP.<br><br>Then...they ran to Taiwan and claimed that Taiwan is the 'real China'<br><br>Till this day, Taiwan could not even proclaim their independence...something that is so simple and basic. And their politicians don't just use their mouth to talk, they use their fists to get their points across.<br><br>Now tell me, who's 'zhong' is worse? Who's forefather is worse?</div></blockquote>actually he's right. our forefathers come from the coastal areas of china, and they are mostly labourers or fishermen in profession. its not wrong to say that our "zhong" is not of superior quality. look at our chinese names, does yours have a profound meaning to it? if you look at the Chinese's names, you will notice that their names are usually with deep meanings, unlike ours, so common and of hardly any special meaning. the comment that our "zhong" was not good was actually first made by MM Lee Kuan Yew.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singaporeans stupid ???<br><br>Taiwan is successful in part because it fit nicely to the US support to hedge against China, thus receiving financial assistance or business... much like South Korea has.. against NK.<br><br>Singapore had to slog it out on our own... on the very first day. Small and kicked out.<br><br>I had the misfortune of partly involved in the overseeing on our factory's  machinery installation project a few years ago. The contract was awarded to a Taiwanese co. And I can tell you... Taiwanese working attitude are the worst I come across ...irresponsible and mindless. Don't know where he got his Masters.. and their technicians are ill discipline and stupid... and downright dangerous.<br><br>Any suggestions from us would received an aggressive response.." that's how we do it in taiwan.. not happy you do lah"... and when we finally said "ok", they will put it to us that it will be "breach of contract" and "warranty is off".<br><br>Can you believe that they would simply hang a 4-ton vibrating machine connected to two belt.. onto a prestressed column 500mm wide, with only four bolts and with no vertical support.. and they boycott and walked out of the factory floor when confronted ! It became our structure nightmare to live with. Other things like disregarding the specs of other existing machines, "not their problems"<br><br>Taiwanese are asshats... and I have not gone into their personal hygene,  fights and demands.... yeah you're stupid alright.. giving them contracts.<br><br>WTF.. the Chinese(China) would usually say "no problem.. don'y worry"... Don't ever ever believe so.. but they would rectify and heed your suggestion.. should you insist.... but not the Taiwanese.</div>
