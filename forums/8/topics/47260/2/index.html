Some are independent; others are loosely interconnected. According to Professor Michael Barkun, one of the leading experts in the Christian Identity movement, "This virulent racist and anti-Semitic theology, which is practiced by over 50,000 people in the United States alone, is prevalent among many right wing extremist groups and has been called the 'glue' of the racist right."<br><br><span style="color: red;">The largest Christian Identity movement has traditionally been the Ku Klux Klan which was reorganized in 1915 by William Simmons, a Christian pastor</span>. He had been inspired by the film The Birth of a Nation which portrayed the KKK as a champion of white civilization. The KKK slid into obscurity by the second World War, but was revitalized in the mid 1950's as a reaction to enforced racial integration in the southern US. </strong></blockquote><a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/cr_ident.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.religioustolerance.org/cr_ident.htm</a><br>stop being so anal about everything that has the world christian in it.</div>

Not me. Maybe you. As far as I am concerned, a christian, I have many friends even in this forum who are muslims whom I considered as friends not terrorists. Were christians the one who labelled muslims terrorists? Maybe some, but there were Buddhists, freethinkers, Toaists, Hindus and many others who did so too. And many Muslims came out in defence and explained that real Muslims would never do that. And now since people are accusing christians of being like the KKK, why cant christians cant come out in defence just as muslims did when they were unfairly labelled terrorists? If you consider this noise, what do you call media coverage of muslims clearing the misconception of muslims being terrorists called? PLease, dun mock at christians for the sake of it, show some proof and no double standards please.

As far as I am concerned, a christian, I have many friends even in this forum who are muslims whom I considered as friends not terrorists. Were christians the one who labelled muslims terrorists? Maybe some, but there were Buddhists, freethinkers, Toaists, Hindus and many others who did so too. And many Muslims came out in defence and explained that real Muslims would never do that. And now since people are accusing christians of being like the KKK, why cant christians cant come out in defence just as muslims did when they were unfairly labelled terrorists? If you consider this noise, what do you call media coverage of muslims clearing the misconception of muslims being terrorists called? PLease, dun mock at christians for the sake of it, show some proof and no double standards please.

So to him i was asking, is there anything wrong if christians decide to defend when something false is said about what they believe. If he believes that muslims have the right to defend themselves why shouldnt christians have that right?</div>
