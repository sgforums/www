What does the Klan think about interracial marriages?<br><br>Everything after its own kind. Racial integrity should be no different than the rest of the plant and animal kingdom. Each species remains true to its genetic pattern as God intended. God called this groupings unified by common traits 'good'. When the fundamental nature of creation is tampered with, the result is ungodly mutation and confusion. A weed patch does not harmonize with a rose garden. Homogenization of race, language, religion and government is as old as the tower of Babel story. The real evil in the world today is the false god of integration promoted by a godless United Nations and the New World Order. The false teachers of churchianity justify interracial marriages in order to keep the White race blind to administering God's laws. A segregated White race will protect itself from alien idolatries. The enemies of God have lived in their luxuries through sin. They can only thrive on their compost of lies. But God's Word is sure and unchanging no matter what the haters of "kind after kind" may say. The fact that God chose a holy and special people to be above all the races of the earth speaks for itself (Deuteronomy 7:6). Truth is not meant to be warm and fuzzy for liberal minded antichrists. Numbers 25 is a javelin lesson for race mixing. Get the message? As Yahweh spoke to the children of Israel (the White race), "Ye shall not go in to them (all other races), neither shall they come in unto you: for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods." (I Kings 11:2) </blockquote></div>

What the faith or religion is, is not equal to what these extremists claim to be.<br><br>The KKK never was a christian group though they claim they are. The bible which says "love your neighbour like yourselves." never teaches that BLACKS is not equal to Whites. Thus on that alone, they are NOT a christian group.</div></blockquote>Actually he would be classifed as a chirstain terrorist if religion was the main reason why he conducted those acts.There are many contestious verses in the bible that does mark it as being racist and single race orientated.However this kinda of interpurrtation of the bible would be to long and tedious for us laymen to interpurrate.Too many factors you see.And well i do believe this phrase would work in this sense....kill them all and let God sort them out.In the sense that we should just let them do what they want and God will deal with them accordingly</div>
