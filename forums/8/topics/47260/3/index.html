As far as I am concerned, a christian, I have many friends even in this forum who are muslims whom I considered as friends not terrorists. Were christians the one who labelled muslims terrorists? Maybe some, but there were Buddhists, freethinkers, Toaists, Hindus and many others who did so too. And many Muslims came out in defence and explained that real Muslims would never do that. And now since people are accusing christians of being like the KKK, why cant christians cant come out in defence just as muslims did when they were unfairly labelled terrorists? If you consider this noise, what do you call media coverage of muslims clearing the misconception of muslims being terrorists called? PLease, dun mock at christians for the sake of it, show some proof and no double standards please. I am willing to show respect to all faiths and beliefs but if you are out to mock, then I am sorry, you do not deserve any.</div></blockquote>the term "muslim extremist" was used by the american govt who are definitely christians. later the press followed up on it. it was reported that arabs and muslims in america were sort of discriminated. although moves were made to mend the situation, damage had been done.<br>and honestly, i do feel that christians in general discriminate against other religions.</div>

George Bush may have proclaimed to be a christian, but does that mean everything he does is because he is a christian and he abuses his power to spread christianity or even to discriminate? There is simply no concrete proof of that. Being American and in the government under a christian president doesnt mean it is a christian government. If it is, they would have make laws like in the most parts of middle east where other faiths are outlawed. If it is, they wouldnt have considering a bill to take out the word 'GOD' from the constituition becos it is deem to sensitive to the multi-religious community of USA.<br><br>Secondly, discrimination happens everywhere. Even in Singapore, there are small scales of discrimination. Who discriminated the arabs in USA? Who? Christians? All christians? Are u sure there are no Freethinkers or Buddhists or Toaists or anyone else other christians who discriminated against arabs in USA? I am not saying that we should find out who's who. But to pin the blame on 'CHRISTIANS' and 'CHRISTIANITY' alone becos the discrimation happens in USA, a western country is a bit unfair and biased and prejudiced, dun u think so?<br><br>Thirdly, where on earth in the bible does it says that Buddhism or Taoism sux? i believe there is none that says that. The bible simply states what the Christians should believe in and unfortunately, these beliefs contradict what other religions believe, and when spoken it may sound like we are despising other religions. But that is purely a difference in beliefs, and we are just speaking out beliefs, is that discrimination? I must say that there are some insensitive christians out there who just say things without caring for another person feelings. But trust me, I have met people from other religions who say the same things to me without caring for my faith and feelings. Humans are like that sometimes, whether they are christians or not. My question is, are all christians like that? and more importantly, do Christianity in your opinion teaches that? Have you know what christianity teaches?<br><br>I think we are all living in a modern and gracious society to fall into the trap of stereotyping. Stereotyping any group of people based on the actions of a few is not something that we should do and it is never nice if everyone starts to stereotype everyone else. I am sure you agree with that.</div>
