            <div class='col-md body'>depending on where you come from, they can be one and the same, or two rather indentical but seperate anomalies.<br>certain religions believe that psychological problems are based more in the spirit than in the physical realm...on the other hand, science works in what is measureable, and what can be qualified and proven, at least to a certain extent, so, it believes that psychological problems occur as a manifestation of congenital defects, neuro defects, and the like...<br><br>for me though, i believe in the former, but believe in treating it in the way of the latter. drugs are not the way to go, but they are a stop-gap measure, psycho therapy or counselling on the other hand, only half works because it is not tackling the root of the problem. religious methods on the other hand, are hard to measure, and not very well understood, because alot of it relies heavily on faith, and not physical properties. as such, we fear the unknown and and we always try to remove that fear, leading to it being pushed away, and never really properly understood...</div>
