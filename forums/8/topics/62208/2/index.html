Usually when people earn more, they tend to spend more.  If u a person doesn't have prudent financial habits, no matter how much he or she earns, i doubt there'll be enough for even the next generation.  To add on to that, usually the next generation, if born into wealth, would even be less likely to be financially prudent.  Confirm spend and spend like water, very fast finish.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The correct question to ask is: What I want my salary to be, and what I must do to achieve it.<br><br>A common trait among Singaporeans is that they think they want to work only as much as they are paid. So, say, given a salary of 1.5K, they work as much as what they perceived to be worth 1.5K of their effort.<br><br>What makes you think you are worth that 1.5K, or that 10K then? Has your presense in the company added value to the company? Or are you secretly hoping that you may skive and escape from responsibilities hoping that nobody knows and still get your huge paycheck at the end of the month?<br><br>Prove that you are indispensible in your firm and your salary will rise naturally. It entails an effort on your part, to take on responsibilities that others will shun, to self study for a skill no one else in your firm has, to put in more hours than your collegues will. But will you do that? Until you do, do not ask how much you think you need to have to be satisfied.<br><br>Having a huge paycheck is a by-product. It is to deserve it because you have worked for it, not the other way round.<br><br>The analysts at investment banks starts their career on an average of 5K salary. Most comes from ivy league collegues in the states. They work an average of 14 to 16 hours a day. Many will go on to become consultants with a 10K paycheck and drives a BMW before they hit 30 years old.<br><br>The auditors at top accounting firms starts their career at 2.5K or less. Many work 16 hours a day during peak periods.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Illegal Operation:</div><div class="quote_body">The correct question to ask is: What I want my salary to be, and what I must do to achieve it.<br><br>A common trait among Singaporeans is that they think they want to work only as much as they are paid. So, say, given a salary of 1.5K, they work as much as what they perceived to be worth 1.5K of their effort.<br><br>What makes you think you are worth that 1.5K, or that 10K then? Has your presense in the company added value to the company? Or are you secretly hoping that you may skive and escape from responsibilities hoping that nobody knows and still get your huge paycheck at the end of the month?<br><br>Prove that you are indispensible in your firm and your salary will rise naturally. It entails an effort on your part, to take on responsibilities that others will shun, to self study for a skill no one else in your firm has, to put in more hours than your collegues will. But will you do that? Until you do, do not ask how much you think you need to have to be satisfied.<br><br>Having a huge paycheck is a by-product. It is to deserve it because you have worked for it, not the other way round.<br><br></div></blockquote>IO, your post made sense up to this point.  However, the examples don't quite gel with me, since they imply that the amount of <strong>time</strong> that one puts in is the key factor here.<br><br>During my years doing the doctorate, I saw those students a few years ahead of me bust their chops so that they could end up working 80 or 90 hours a week.  What the hell were they working like dogs for?  So they could run themselves ragged like any other poor slob with an undergraduate degree?  That idea's for the birds - I spent four hours a day working, and got slightly less dosh than someone else with my qualifications working four times as much.  When I did work, I made sure it produced results that counted.  The rest of the time, I was sitting back and chilling.<br><br>I mentioned in an earlier post that I knew consultants pulling $35000 a month.  One of them is a mother of four, who works three days a week.  She spends the rest of her time at her beachside home with her kids.  It's not how much time you put in, it's what you do with that time.</div>
