            <div class='col-md body'>Marcus,<br><br>What I can say is that, City Harvest is a rather controversial church. I am not saying whether it is good or bad, as different people may have different ways of doing things, so it is not for me to judge. Maybe for me, they are wrong, but maybe for them, they are right.<br><br>I think you yourself also know that City Harvest is rather controversial and that's why you wanted to be careful and asked people for their opinions.<br><br>You may go there to see and decide for yourself.<br><br>Another suggestion is, you may also want to attend Catholic churches and then decide for yourself which one you find most suitable.</div>
