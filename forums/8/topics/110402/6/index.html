            <div class='col-md body'>Religious wars have happened in the past and now in the present and will always happen in the future until religion is divorced from greed, power and politics.  <strong> Religion is a powerful tool aimed at achieving a greater good but we will always have individuals who strive for achievement of their personal and financial good. </strong><br><br>Christianity was used by the Catholic Church in the past to manipulate politics in europe  and to control countries.  It was the sins of the people ( like Cardinal Richeliu) who made use of christianity to control others and gain powers. The spanish Inquisition instilled absolute obedience in the layfolk and nobility alike.<br>Northern Ireland is an excellent example of people (Protestants Vs Catholics) using religion as an excuse to start a war.<br><br>Islam is not that far off . The crusades - the persecution of the jews and christians  etc.  Osama bin Laden using holy war as an excuse to kill innocent people to enforce his wishes. He should have bombed the white house instead of World Trade Center. Saddam used the tag "holy war" when he urged the middle eastern countries to help him drive americans off kuwaiti soil.<br><br>It is not religion's fault things turn out the way it did but rather the fault of the individuals who were willing to sacrifice people for power.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What is done in the name of Christianity can't be considered Christianity. The men who fought the crusades were in direct conflict with what our religion says.<br>Matt 5:9,Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the sons of God.<br>Matt 5:44,But I tell you:Love your enemies and pray for those that persecute you,<br><br>The acts of individuals who chose to use the name of Christianity to commit acts such as the crusades cannot be used to represent main-stream Christianity. Even Jesus Christ himself warned about such individuals. The masterminds of the crusades etc etc were acting against what is stated in the Bible.</div>

Did I say it is protestants ?? Is catholic a religion ? Then scully the next one who came in tell me buddhism is not involved in the witch hunting or crusades. BTW isn't protestants formed from catholic ?<br><br>How about the Midianites who is fighting for their soveriegnity ? The men were killed, girls made slaves and posessions plundered. U say tat babylon, sodom etc r places of great evil. So they ought to be destroyed ? Then isn't tat supporting religion to destroy other factors like Turkish or witch hunting etc because they thought they r "evil" too ? Isn't tat promoting violence ? Is tat the way to solve problems ? </div></blockquote>buddism was never violent nor drawn into conflict because buddism wasn't founded as a religeon..it was founded as a philosophy...it was only after they mixed it up with hinduism and taoism did buddism evolve into a religeon. anyways..if those places arent evil enough for you..those weren't peaceful homos..they practically gay raped every visitor and fathers slept with their own daughters..just freakin think for a second..if you created something and somebody else came to defile and detsory your creation..by common sense you would natually get rid of it...if you were God, would you want the people u created to worship some demonic idols? of course not. witch hunting? you have no idea how evil witch practices used to be..they were the ones who started the original halloween..they didn't trick or treat for sweets..they trick or treated for little children to be sacrificed at pagaan rituals...and as for the crusades and ther turks? i believed it was allowed to happen because the orthodox byzantines strayed from the original faith..they were the ones who first persecuted the real christians..then constantine came along and came up with his own pagaan version of christianity..they deserved to be punished. that is not promoting violence..it is promoting the fact that justice has to be done to ensure peace and stability and order..not debauchery and brutality. if you don't believe what i stated..i dare you to reseach around and prove me wrong.</div>
