            <div class='col-md body'>I think everyones got thier own perception of churches and why the need to go ..but the most important thing is not whether u go churches anot... Yes God is with you where ever you are and we communicate with him anywhere we wan even at home. ppl go churches becos we need to understand what jesus said or meant in the bible... as many christians know that the bibles are written in parables and we can only understand the pure basic of each but thru bible studies the pastor are able to decipher the true meaning and to enlighten the christians ... However they are churches who infact abuses the trust of their followers and actually making personal gains from it... But Pastor are teachers they need to be paid too.. if they are not paid who will preach? they need bread and jesus has bread for them ... For those who thinks going to churches is for self help group or cell group ... Then maybe you are going the wrong direction my dear friend .... the main thing is to learn or enlighten ourselves about the bible....<br>And other thing is about forcing others to join? these i find it funny.... Christians do not force believers  I know they are ppl who are excited and too enxious to convert friends but please God need not Sell ... Ppl come to God Let them come willing and not sell God comes you might be degrading God instead of worshipping... And comments about what christians do ... drinking , smoking , blah blah ... for those do you expect christians to be all fathers and nuns? its 21st century of cos its not of the century that things are this way even god himself drinks even ppl in history drinks... so whats wrong about drinking? we are not muslims we are allowed to drink ... God do not restrict us in our daily lifes What God wants is our spiritual self to cleanse and refrain from sins How as long as you believe in god where and when he will show you the way</div>
