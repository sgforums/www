You sure that the Catholic Church used to forbid the reading of the Holy Scripture?<br><br>So here lies your argument. Why didn't people in the middle ages read the Bible?<br><br>The Bible was on scrolls and parchments during the early centuries of Christianity. Nobody had a "Bible". Even into the Middle Ages, each Bible was written by hand. Most people were only functionally literate. The printing press was not invented until 1436 by Johann Gutenberg. So prior to 1436, the idea of everybody having a Bible was out of the question, even if they could read.<br>After the invention of the printing press, prior to Luther's Bible being published in German, there had been over 20 versions of the whole Bible translated into the various German dialects (High and Low) by Catholics. Similarly, there were several vernacular versions of the Bible published in other languages both before and after the Reformation. The Church did condemn certain vernacular  translations because of what it felt were bad translations and anti-Catholic notes. (Vernacular means native to a region or country)<br><br>The Catholic Douay-Rheims version of the whole Bible in English was translated from the Latin Vulgate. It was completed in 1610, one year before the King James Version was published. The New Testament had been published in 1582 and was one of the sources used by the KJV translators. The Old Testament was completed in 1610.<br><br>The Latin Vulgate was always available to anyone who wanted to read it without restriction. Some have said that it would only have been usable by people who read Latin. But in the 16th Century there were no public schools and literacy was not that common, especially among the peasants. Those people who could read had been well educated and could read Latin.<br><br>So you might say, The Church still had its readings and services in Latin, which most of them could not understand!<br><br>But Latin was far from being a dead language! It was the language of theology and science (the language of all educated peoples throughout Europe and beyond!) well into the 17th and 18th Centuries. For example, when Isaac Newton published his works on physics, he published them in Latin so that all of Europe could read them. The same was true of all other scientific and scholarly advances.  The reason that the Protestant reformers used vernacular languages was because a) most educated people did not take the reformers seriously and b) they used the masses to get power for their movement. The pamphlets published by Luther and Calvin were filled with all manner of crude and dirty language (lots of references to "s hitting," "pissing," and "farting" ), and this was done to capture the imagination of the common man and to create popular uprising against the social establishment.<br><br>The Bible could very much be understood by people with the intelligence and ability to understand its theological content -- most of whom spoke Latin. Most common people of the time, however, could understand neither the language nor the content. And most common people are still clueless about the content of the Bible today! Which is why Protestants supply "ministers" to interpret it for them....  I say again, the Catholic Church was never opposed people reading the Bible! What it opposed was people reading interpretations the Bible apart from the teaching authority of the Church, which would lead to the kinds of problems we have today with 30,000 denominations interpreting scripture differently. The Bible itself warns against this. (2 Peter 1:20). With the invention of printing, there was a communications explosion, and one suddenly saw lots of people making very poor and heretical translations of the Bible and popularizing them throughout Christendom. The Church tried to put an end to it.<br><br>Some Evangelicals accuse the Catholic Church of "Chaining Bibles". The Church DID chain Bibles in the Middle Ages; and for the same reason that StarHub chains its directories to the booth -- to prevent people from STEALING them.<br><br>We must remember that each Bible had to be copied by hand and that it took the lifetime of a monk to do this. According to standards today, each one of these Bibles would probably be worth $20,000. Records have been compiled which show that there were 5,000 chained books in 11 Protestant and 2 Catholic libraries. The Reformers, likewise, chained their Bibles in their churches for at least 300 years. Therefore, Catholics were not alone in chaining Bibles.<br><br><a href="http://www.catholicbridge.com/bible_catholics.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.catholicbridge.com/bible_catholics.htm</a></div>

In fact those who pay the 10% are the real losers. There is no real need for members to pay 10%. thsi is how the church earns money. people with brains will definitely question the need to pay 10&amp; but it surprises me that many people take "its for the love of God" as a legitimate answer....tsk tsk</div>

That is why the devil is so anti-Christ. Since the devil sincerely believe that, why doesn't he go to heaven? Because Christ died for man and not the devil?</div>
