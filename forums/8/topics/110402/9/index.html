            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>can you prove that creationism aint true?</blockquote>I have been speaking about tis point for a million times but I guess I have to do again. I can say tat god is actually a purple hippotamus or a pink unicorn. Can u prove me to be wrong ? I can say noch ness monster exists. Can u prove to me tat it doesn't ? Even if u manage to show tat noch ness monster is not found in noch ness, I can easily say it may exists in jupiter, alpha a or some distant stars or something. U can't prove it. Therefore, people who r logical and scientific requires u to prove your point instead of asking other people to prove u wrong. If creationism exists, it should be u to prove it out to us and not us to prove u to be wrong. U get the point ?<br><br><blockquote>how do u think evolution started then? how do u think the single cell organisms that were supposedly the origins of evolution came about? </blockquote>Evolution started because living organism change to fit the environemnt better. How did the origin of evolution which is the first cell come about, it is still under study. It is possible tat it is created in the most natural of ways. However the idea tat all living things r not evolved but created (creationism) is wrong. Dogs doesn't just popped out of thin air but rather evolved from wolves or foxes. If u believe tat only the first cell is "created" while the rest of the species of living things r evolved from tat cell, glad to say u already believe in evolution; i.e a single cell EVOLVED to become some plant which EVOLVED to become fish etc etc etc<br><br><blockquote>you can never read and truly understand the bible and nor do all people who do read the bible become christians, </blockquote>on wat ground cau u say tat ? Do u know me or the bible is impossible to understand since it is full of contradictions ?<br><br><blockquote>in fact...i can betcha that over 75% ofchristians never read more than 20% of the bible. first u tell me you believe in the truth..now you tell me that u BELIEVE that blah blah blah..aren't you contradicting yourself?</blockquote>I say I believe in the truth.

She has in fact admitted their crimes. Yes, I have heard of the Inquisitions. I merely want to find out what you know about it.

If you refuse to believe the Catholic view, I will show you what your Protestant forefathers have said.<br><br>Ulrich Zwingli says,<br><blockquote>I firmly believe according to the words of the gospel that a pure virgin brought forth for us the Son of God and remained a virgin pure and intact in childbirth and also after the birth, for all eternity. I firmly trust that she has been exalted by God to eternal joy above all creatures, both the blessed and the angels.</blockquote>Ulrich Zwingli, quoted in Augustin Bea, Â“Mary and the Protestants,Â” Marian Studies 83, April 1961, 1.<br><br>Martin Luther says,<br><blockquote>Christ . . . was the only Son of Mary, and the Virgin Mary bore no children besides Him . . . Â“brothersÂ” really means Â“cousinsÂ” here, for Holy Writ and the Jews always call cousins brothers. </blockquote>Martin Luther, Sermons on John, Chapters 1-4, 1537-39.<br><br>Let us practise charity, and not let this discussion escalate into a flame skirmish.</div>

Christianity is not just believing &amp; faith, it's a relationship with God.<br>2) Yes, it's almost impossible to interpret &amp; understand the bible unless you study Hebrew, Greek etc then again it's still not possible to understand its entirety. Simply, some were passages from the Holy Spirit, some were from God speaking to men &amp; some while Jesus is still on this earth. If you really understand the bible, then you won't find any contradictions.  Never take the bible out of its context, you want to read one verse, make sure you read the rest. Many things stated in the bible describing the end times are already happening.<br>3) Yes God is everywhere at anytime. We still go to church because it's a body of Christ. Because this is where we all come to fellowship, worship Him &amp; grow. By keeping yourself at home (unless your parents locked you away from church), how can you mature? Just like if you don't go &amp; get tp know someone better. how are you going to know for sure what kind of person he/she really is. You mean by talking on the phone you can understand his/ her habits, real attitude, give her/ him a human touch when they need it etc? So likewise, when you need comforting, there're people to pray for you and lend a helping hand.<br>4) Yes nobody is perfect, that's why we need God.<br>5) I have heard this old man say, people say God comes to them, but not those other gods he believed in, he has to go to "them"...hence he made up his mind to believe in the one true God.<br>6) Yes not all Christians are good, but they claim they're Christians, what does God see in them, that's another issue. It's not our position to judge them, we can tell them where it goes wrong but it's up to them to repent. Some people make use of Christianity to make themselves look good, not glorify God.<br>7) Christians are the most judged people on earth. Why? Cos many know the truth in their hearts but are afraid what the world will think of them so they turn round to attack us.<br><br>that's all I have to say....hope it will sit well with you guys.<br></div>

I need you to prove that the Catholic Church does not allow the laity to read the bible.<br><br>Can you prove that? Because, it seriously is a very ridiculous claim. Now let me correct you. The church has always encouraged the laity to read their bibles! We have always emphasised the importance of the Holy Scripture. St Jerome says, "Whoever does not know Scripture, does not know God."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, I have 2 groups of people tat is telling me not to read the bible<br><br>1. They say tat non believers shouldn't read the bible. They claim tat those who read the bible must already have faith in it. Tat just means tat they themselves already have faith in the bible before they personally read it. The faith must have come from his friends and families tat had brainwash him sufficiently.<br><br>2. They r saying people who do not know greek, latin, hebrew shouldn't read the bible or understand them. In tat case almost 99% of the christians do nto know anything about hebrew and greek either. Then it is a puzzling phenomenon tat this 99% of the population believe in something they don't understand.<br><br>trust me, I have experienced these kind of dumb opinions in my years here.</div>
