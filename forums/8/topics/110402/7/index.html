They don't want talks, they don't want to pursuade, they don't wanna try to change these people but instead they do a quick job by killing every single one of them. As such, tis make the religion violent, and believe tat violence is a solution to opposition.<br><br><blockquote>just freakin think for a second..if you created something and somebody else came to defile and detsory your creation..by common sense you would natually get rid of it...if you were God, would you want the people u created to worship some demonic idols?</blockquote>Frankly, i will not end a life just because it doesn't worship me. If I create human, and they decide to worship some other things because I keep hiding from them, not giving them any evidences of my existence, I don't blame them for worshipping some other things. It doesn't affect me in any way.<br><br><blockquote>of course not. witch hunting? you have no idea how evil witch practices used to be..they were the ones who started the original halloween..they didn't trick or treat for sweets..they trick or treated for little children to be sacrificed at pagaan rituals...</blockquote>Oh really ? U probably heard too muich one sided story.<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witchhunt" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witchhunt</a><br><br>Let me cut out some interesting sentence for others to read<br><br>Many of the suspects <strong>were women who lived in towns</strong>, villages or rural areas and who may have been <strong>practitioners of herbalism, natural healing or midwifery</strong>; but often it was simply <strong>poor, uneducated women </strong>who did not have influential friends. Early Modern Christian authorities in Europe (both Catholic and Protestant) regarded any such expression of non-Christian, natural spirituality with intense paranoia and hatred. This was in accord with <strong>literal readings of the Old Testament, which contains fierce attacks against the polytheism of non-Hebrew peoples.</strong><br><br><strong>The most important form of evidence in many of the witch trials was attained by "ordeal". These efforts included torture of the most horrific nature including hot pincers, the thumbscrew, the iron maiden, and many other such methods. Torture methods varied by region and the person carrying out the ordeal.</strong><br><br>The East Anglia region of England at one point during the chaos of the Civil War had a self-proclaimed "Witchfinder General", one Matthew Hopkins, who led searches, and who claimed to be able to identify a witch using techniques such as witches' marks. Today it is not believed that most of the accused ever regarded themselves as witches.<br><br>Research into the laws and records of the time show that the witchfinders often used peine forte et dure and other torture to extract confessions and condemnations of friends, relatives and neighbors. Virtually everyone today looks on this period of history as a very dark time.<br><br>The peculiar beliefs and superstitions attached to or associated with witchcraft caused those who were suspected of practising the craft to be extremely likely to be subjected to tortures of greater degree than any ordinary heretic or criminal. More, certain specific torments were invented for use against them.<br><br></div>

The breakdown of the Carolingian empire in the later 9th century, combined with the relative stabilization of local European borders after the Christianization of the Vikings, Slavs and Magyars, meant that there was an entire class of warriors who now had very little to do but fight among themselves and terrorize the peasant population. The Church tried to stem this violence with the Peace and Truce of God movements, forbidding violence against certain people at certain times of the year. This was somewhat successful, but trained warriors always needed an outlet for their violence. A plea for help from the Byzantine Emperor Alexius I in opposing Muslim attacks thus fell on ready ears.<br><br>One later outlet was the Reconquista in Spain, which at times occupied Spanish knights and some mercenaries from elsewhere in Europe in the fight aganist the Islamic Moors. In 1063, Pope Alexander II had given papal blessing to Spanish Christians in their wars against the Muslims, granting both a papal standard (the vexillum sancti Petri) and an indulgence to those who were killed in battle<br><br>A turning point in western attitudes towards the east came in the year 1009, when the Fatimid caliph of Cairo, al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, had the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem destroyed. His successor permitted the Byzantine Empire to rebuild it under stringent circumstances, and pilgrimage was again permitted, but many stories began to be circulated in the West about the cruelty of Muslims toward Christian pilgrims; these rumors then played an important role in the development of the crusades later in the century.<br><br></span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The year was 1095 CE, William the Conqueror had united England under one crown 30 years earlier. The French had been dividing properties amongst their sons for generations, causing bloodshed between brothers over small pieces of real estate. In reaction, Pope Urban II expanded "The Truce of God", which outlawed fighting from Sunday to Wednesday, and banned fighting involving priests, monks, women, laborers and merchants on any day of the week. Italy was a collection of city-states, constantly being overrun by invading hordes, the latest of which were the Normans, who had just started to become "civilized".<br><br>There was also the Byzantine empire, ruling from Constantinople, whose emperor at this time was Alexius Comnenus. To his East, the Turks were rapidly encroaching on his empire, and had begun attacking pilgrims on their way to - and in - Jerusalem, causing him great distress. He wrote to his friend Robert, the Count of Flanders, in 1093, telling him about supposed atrocities committed by the Turks on the Christian pilgrims, and Robert passed this letter on to Pope Urban II. Urban, an opportunist, saw this as a perfect way to solve some of his local problems. He personally promoted a Holy Crusade to reclaim the Holy Lands from the barbarian Turks. Thus, the First Crusade was launched in 1096 CE</span><br><br>First crusade<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Needless to say, Peter's Quest was doomed. They behaved poorly along the route, thieving food and ransacking homes for supplies. The worst was the persecution of the Jews before even leaving Europe.</span><br><br><blockquote>Once in Anatolia, Peter's followers felt it was time to start Crusading in earnest, torturing, pillaging and massacring indiscriminately. However, as it turned out, most of their victims were Byzantine Christians who lived in and around Nicaea.</blockquote>After the conquer of jerusalem<br><br><blockquote>No Jews were spared either. The Crusaders, in their fury, slaughtered all. Moslems in the Dome, or Jews in their Synagogue, all were killed without regard.<br><br>When no one but the Crusaders were left alive, they proceeded to the Holy Sepulchre to give thanks</blockquote>Antioch<br><br><blockquote>By the end of the evening of July 3, 1098, blood soaked the city streets. Every Turk was killed. In their zeal, many Christians were slain also.</blockquote>Tis is really just an war between muslim and christian. The muslim conquer the Byzantine Empire, and christian decide to attack them and conquer the territories for himself. Most of the attack by crusader r not on liberating these countries, but by gaining other territories for themselves. The christian want to expand its power by using force and attack nearby countries. U say muslims r evil, but clearly they r saying christians r the evil ones. They totally wiped out the whole muslim and jews race whenever they succeed in conquering these cities. Every single one of them die. And embarrasingly, these crusaders even attack one another during this history. It manage to gain territories from muslim during those years, but it was all lost back to them in 90 years. All this made the jews and muslim having a hardened stand against christainity. All in all, it was described as a dark history<br><br><blockquote>if you don't believe what i stated..i dare you to reseach around and prove me wrong.</blockquote>I have researched and believe to have give ample evidence of the problems of witch hunting and crusaders.

They were usually poor women with no family to offer protection. They were widows like Katherine Porter or young women such as Elspeth Bruce. Any women who was a little different and who lived on the fringes of respectable, church going society could find herself accused if the climate was right. This would include anyone who had a squint, regarded as the evil eye, or who suffered from epilepsy, considered to be possession by the devil. Midwives were often accused. If they could bring life into the world, they might decide to take life out of this world. The same applied to women with a knowledge of herbal medicine.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Confessions were not freely obtained from witch suspects. It was common to use what we would now call torture to get confessions of guilt from the accused. Any museum in any Scottish burgh will have thumbscrews and a branks, or scoldÂ’s bridle as it is also known, a device for depressing the tongue and keeping suspects quiet. There were also a number of more subtle tortureÂ’s used on Scottish witch suspects such as waking and light deprivation. In "waking" or sleep deprivation witch suspects were deliberately kept from sleeping. Local guards took turns to stay in the tolbooth with the suspects. If the women fell asleep it was the job of the guards to march the women up and down the prison to keep them from sleeping. This process continued until they made a confession. After a number of nights without rest people would do anything to be allowed to sleep. It can also cause hallucinations. Light deprivation can have much the same effect. Although it was winter the women were not allowed a candle to see by or a fire to warm themselves. If they had access to a naked flame the witch hunters believed that they would use their magical powers to summon the devil to set them free.</span><br><br><a href="http://65.109.176.35/warmcove/morningstar/chapter8.html" rel="nofollow">http://65.109.176.35/warmcove/morningstar/chapter8.html</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Reformation did not convert the people of Europe to orthodox Christianity through preaching and catechisms alone. It was the 300 year period of witch-hunting from the fifteenth to the eighteenth century, what R.H. Robbins called "the shocking nightmare, the foulest crime and deepest shame of western civilization,"(1) that ensured the European abandonment of the belief in magic. The Church created the elaborate concept of devil worship and then, used the persecution of it to wipe out dissent, subordinate the individual to authoritarian control, and openly denigrate women. </span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Christians found fault with women on all sorts of counts. An historian notes that thirteenth century preachers<br><br>...denounced women on the one hand for... the lascivious and carnal provocation of their garments, and on the other hand for being over- industrious, too occupied with children and housekeeping, too earthbound to give due thought to divine things</span><br><br><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/scottishhistory/union/oddities_union_2.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/scottishhistory/union/oddities_union_2.shtml</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">For those accused of witchcraft ,sleep deprivation was used to entice them into answering questions about their practice. After three days of being awake, hallucinations would set in and the will to resist crumbled. The confessions extracted from them often revealed bizarre hallucinogenic scenes such as flying, changing into animals, meeting the devil and taking part in witchesÂ’ sabbaths.<br>None of which were real, but where enough on their own to convict a witch, especially during times of panic.</span><br><br>SO all of them r false ? U still can't show me anything tat is NON-CHRISTIAN tat show witch hunt is good. Do u trust BBC and Wikepedia now ? Or u don't trust anybody except your pastor ?<br><br>Perhaps it is religious extremists tat create so much problem in this world. Maybe u should be the one tat should start to reflect if everything u heard from churches etc r real.</div>
