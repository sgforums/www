            <div class='col-md body'>I think you should just go and attend one session and see/feel for yourself. If you like the ways things are done there, you could continue, if not you could stop going.<br><br>I am nt a christian but i remember a christian friend did told me that one of the main idea of the religon is "acceptance". If you do find the place comfortable and want to stop going, they should accept ur decision. With acceptance of shortcomings or conflicting ideas, then come the love and faith the christian shown on other fellow christian and non-christian. And of course with love and faith, it is easier to accept things, more ppls can do the later but not the first.<br><br>BTW, if you have strong faith, any churches would be the same.<br>And also why did you choose this path. Born christian? Coz i hav a few friends who are converted christian were not sure why they choose this path. they say that the services is fun, they were taught what is right and wrong, their original religon were troublesome and old fashion. Basically i am worry that they are there for a wrong reason as they are normally teenagers and some churches dont function as they are used to be and all religon shd teach rights from wrongs. I am not hinting anything, just dun wish ppls to be blind followers.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mind ur word!! He is man of God. God is watching what u guys are saying. Please donÂ’t judge people, only the Heavenly Father has the right to judge us as a potter judges his clays (Bible says, Â“Â….judge not, you shall not be judgedÂ”.) If he does against GodÂ’s will, God will never spare him, coz he misleads more than 16,000 believers into the hand of Satan. But if he leads the church and saves souls into the kingdom of God, as God wish, be aware if u r trying to stop other people going to the church, or saying something bad about GodÂ’s faithful servants. If u have time, please read stories in the Bible, really no joke!<br><br>What car he drives, what house he stays, or anything he owns.. is it really important to u? Why do u hv the evil thought and let jealousy fills ur heart when u see people live better than u? (sorry, no offendÂ…). If u r so free, instead of judging or criticising people, please do care about ur own spiritual life, think about caring and help the poorÂ… Pray for the people who r suffering nowÂ….<br><br>CHC is ISO certified, so whatÂ’s wrong with it. I m working as QA Engineer, dealing with ISO matters. Let me say something, when the church is growing to such a big organization, it is necessary to have a proper system to manage the whole church with more than 16,000 believers. Everything shall be documented and recorded as the system provides transparency.<br><br>If u so worry about misuse of money in the church, then I really dun understand the purpose and duty of churchÂ’s accountants. What I m sure that CHC uses money for GodÂ’s work, no doubt. Ask u a simple question,  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  if the church doesn't do anything including missionary works n helping people in need, where does the money go as the believers keep give offering and tithe to the church?<br><br>Of course there is no perfect church on this earth including CHC. If u hear a church claims that is a perfect church, dun be naive, better keep away from that church.<br><br>marcuz1977, dun choose a church based on ur worldly judgement, otherwise u will get confused and discouraged. Dun simply choose a church because of a big church, many believers? Or a church without commitment? Or a church with many nice events? Or pastors preach to delight their believers? Most important thing is ur spiritual grow in Christ. Observe spiritual fruit of the churches and pastors. Pray for wisdom given by God. Talk with mature Christians when u r in doubt.<br><br>Mature Christians shouldn't criticize, but encourage each other,as iron sharpen iron. Brothers and sisters should walk together in fellowship in christ. Some believers leave and criticise their previous church, mostly because of commitment, tithing, pride.....<br><br>Remember, God is good God, He will take care well of u and plant u in a right church coz He loves u.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I said, I got nothing against the religion. But I got bad feelings about that church.<br>There's nothing wrong with Christianity.
