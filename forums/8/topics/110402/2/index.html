Pls don't tell me of CHC.......<br><br>coming back to all these pastors etc, i still think some of the teachers back in school, the older generation without out all the modern fanfare of youth service etc, the traditional christians i put it, they do have strike a sense of respect and awe. I always remember how one of my teachers used to talk abt men not reaching out to god and god trying to reach out to us. then he showed us some painting by Micheangelo. it was humbling experience IMO. and their gracious self and tolerant attitude towards other religions and explaning of idelogy is pretty clear cut and unbiased.<br><br></div>

Of course getting back to a church physically is one thing and regaining the communication spiritually is another thing (that will be another topic).<br><br>I just discovered a few mins ago and also from the reading the replies to this thread that there were previous discussion about CHC here. I tried searching for those threads but they were locked and I can't read some of them.<br><br>Wonder if there is any other forum that discuss churches and christianity in Singapore?<br><br>Thanks all.<br><br>Blessed night.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>personally as a christian myself, i view CHC as nothing more than a decadent modern babylon. what kind of "christian church" operates in such a manner and what kind of "christians" dance and sing in such wanton manner?  never has "christ like" been defined as spartan style living, if you can afford stuff..nothing wrong with owning them. as for the "christ-like" part..i dare say Jesus would be super angry if he saw such a "church". you might as well come out of the closet and call CHC city harvest social club instead of "church".</div>
