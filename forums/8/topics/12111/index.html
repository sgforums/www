If the religion you believed in suddenly asked you to burn yourself, donate money to them or pray to them every weekend. I think senseless pple will happily do it just like the Fa Lun Gong case. Use some logic, stop dreaming and start living practically.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>The little girl rushed to the police and screamed "Shu Shu Jiu Wo!Shu Shu Jiu Wo!"

Imagined wat would happened if the policemen think that the god will help the girl and stand there staring for miracle to happen. Bring some sense to yourself also.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Kyo23 (edited 23 July 2001).]</div>

If the world ends it ends, no amount of technology (period) will be able to save you once the earth and the entire cosmos decides to dry up or explode.  Kaput!  You're gone and everything in it.  You can carry on dreaming about Science but this is very real but it's no use to you, right?<br><br>What you think is that once someone believes in God, they don't have to worry about anything.  In a way its true, from another point of view.  One is needed to make themself useful and occupy with meaningful thing.  Your concept is that once there is God, believers do not have to do anything just relax and everything is fine and well.  Sad to say your understanding cannot be more wrong.  Can you at least get that in your head.  Use your Blain, Use your Blain!!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Is it coincidence or are you always avoiding a strong argument and replacing it with your own assumptions and theories.  I've seen you do that a couple of times already, so... stop sliming Christians or Buddhists or whoever.  I'm stating facts here because in whatever posts from you, you put down God.<br><br>Oh, if you have not noticed.  The 2nd paragraph of my last post mirrors your thoughts on a virtual being nicked "god".  But I'm hitting at your love for science and logic.  Oooohhhh... hurts right?  Sigh... go carry on with your life.</div>
