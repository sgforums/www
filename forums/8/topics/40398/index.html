A killer takes away a life of another.  My mother who has killed another person is still a killer.  She has taken away another life.  She has denied the right of another to live.  Her being my mother is a fact.  There is no denying that.  But there is also no denying that she's a killer 'cause she killed.  Therefore, she will be condemned as a killer, but she will always be my mother.<br><br>Does a homosexual take away another life?  What has the homosexual done?  Nothing.
