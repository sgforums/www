With regards to homosexuality, research is still ongoing.  If I live in a warped world as you so-claimed, would I have bothered to research for articles?  You, on the other hand, expect to be spoon fed with info.  Who's the kid now?<br><br>Your angst against them saying that they were born with it is your problem, not theirs.  But wait, first you said you condemn homosexuality but now you have no problems with them having such a lifestyle?  Will you make up your mind?  My concern is how people discriminate against homosexual people, whether they're my friends or relatives.  If they have killed people, I've to let the law handle it.  But what have homosexual people really done to deserve such negativity against them?  Did they try to make you one?  Did they try to make you stray from your straight life?  If not, why are you so angry about it?  there is no clear reason for the discrimination.  Worse, we seem to discriminate against male homsoexuality but not lesbianism.  What's up with that?  Is that being mature?<br><br>He is my friend and continues being my friend because I accept him for who and what he is regardless if he's a homosexual or not.  I accept his practices so long as he doesn't press those practices on me.  Let's use your smoking example.  He's my friend and continues being my friend so long as he doesn't try to get me to smoke.  No separation whatsoever.  and you know why?  'Cause if that person wsn't my friend but was still a homosexual, I'd give him the same respect as a homosexual as I would my friend.

I don't see you hitting the guys who talk about how wonderful anal sex is.  Double standards?  Hmmm...<br><br>For a person who uses God here, I'd suggest you learn to open your mind a bit more on different angles of thought.  You don't have to believe or advocate it, just listen.  Remember, no one is telling you to be a homosexual.  And neither is anyone saying that homosexuality is more right than being straight.  Neither are homosexuals telling you that they're better than you.   And they have never said that straight people are sick liek you have so blantantly done.<br><br>Here's a question...

Sure. What makes you think I do not have people who I am in close contact with and hates my religion? Even on this forum people I have met, they disclose their dislike for my faith, does it make them like me any lesser? No isnt it. It is not that I do want to understand how you feel. But how did you respond to me? You come in straight and insist I cant possibly condemn homosexuality ONLY. You INSIST on that. What else do I need to say? You think I never met people who thinks homosexuality is a matter of nature and nurture? I have, kid. In fact, i counselled this group of people. Some of them think they way u thought, that their behaviour is nurtured and of nature. I openly disagree with them. EVEN THEY, homosexuals themselves can agree that I can  condemn homosexuality yet not them as a person, why CANT you? Do you even understand HOMOSEXUALS? I am answering as a courtesy. I do not have to answer you at all to justify myself.
