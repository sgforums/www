If you would read your own posting, you'll realise that you just highlighted the double standard itself.  What is homosexuality?  Is it merely specific to just males?  I don't think so.  So we're able to accept two women bathing together.  We can accept a hit song by a woman who sang 'I Kissed A Girl'.  We can accept two women holding hands and kissing each other.  I know very well that men and women will never be equal.  But if someone just starts blasting homosexuality, I'm saying that it should cover women homosexuality as well.  That's the double standard you have so clearly highlighted yourself.<br><br>you know why I can't accept it.  Very simple.  No one has given me any real good reason as to why male homosexuality should be looked down upon the way some people have expressed themselves.  Homosexuality has not done any real harm when compared to smoking and murder (as these 2 examples were used).  You say you'll feel sick?  Is that because you were brought up to react that way?  Is that even the right bring up then?  Don't tell me you never question things?  If anyone is going to say the spread of diseases, you and I know very well, that even AIDS is spread quite easily through other means.  Just look at the anti casual sex ads around.<br><br>I'm not even telling people to support homosexualism.  But my stand is to tell them not to discriminate.  You want to discriminate, do it for both men and women.  Have you been discriminated against before for no real reason?  And when asked, all you get is 'Just because'.  Is that even acceptable?<br><br>kukujiao, my reply to your post is in the 'gays' thread.<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>

Some of them think they way u thought, that their behaviour is nurtured and of nature. I openly disagree with them.

Sheesh...  who's trying to even garner support to go against you?  I'm here all on me own.  What are you?  You're strutting around like some big boss man of the house.  Do I need to tell you that this is a forum?  Anything you insert here is open to debate.  Yoiu're supposed to expect reaction to whatever you say here.  That's what a forum is about.  Oh, did you compare the tone of your reaction to my response to you and mine to your first posting?<br><br>You mentioned that I came straight in and told you that you couldn't condemn homosexuality alone, right?  News flash, hombre.  That was your statement in your very first posting in this thread.  You said that you condemn homosexuality and not homosexuals.  Ring a bell?  To me, that's contradicting.  You sure have selective reading or something.  When I was using your religion as an example, did you even read the part when I asked if I was justified to say that your religion's full of crock despite saying that I respect as you as a person?  I said it wasn't to me.  I'll spell it to you in a different way.  Let's say you're a devout Chrisitian.  Why?  Because you practise the ways of Christ, right?  Now, it's only a religion, you'd probably say.  But if you're a practictioner, what you do makes you a Christian.  If I condemned Christianity for all its worth, would I not be disrespecting you and your practices?  Simple 'yes/no' question here.  To me, if I wanted to respect you, I'd respect what you do, and not condemn it.  Your actions make you what you are.  But if you start trying to push your Chrsitianity beliefs on me, that's a different story.<br><br>Now remember, I'm talking about homosexuality here because homosexuals, to me, don't cause direct harm.  They're like any other human being.  Drug users and killers are not condoned because they deny the lives of others.<br><br>I'm going to stick to the issue - what is so bad about homosexuality or what are your reasons for condemning homosexuality?  You said your religion and morals gave you that stance.  What is it about them that made you think that way?  Care to elaborate?  I've had huge discussions with Christians on homosexuality, bisexuality and transverstites.  Still a stalemate, I'd say.  Maybe you could give me a fresh perspective.<br><br>Bring it on!![/quote]</div>

I'm showing you the proper respect of debating this issue in as healthy a manner as possible and you have neither shown me the proper respect nor regulatd your tone.  You wouldn't want me to tell youmhow childish your language is, would you?  That would be diverting the subject, aye?<br><br>Back to the issue at hand...<br><br>Great quote especially the second part.  I was referred to some readings and they were quite horrifying because they were talkig about how the people advocated the killing of homosexuals.  Those readings definitely didn't give me a very good impression of anti-homosexuality Christians.  But your second quote does show that at the end of it all, your God still one and all.<br><br>Now, why are you asking questions that I've already answered?  I said that if I'm respecting you as a person, I should respect your beliefs in Christianity and what it teaches.  So in terms of homosexuality, I should respect homosexuality so long as you don't press it down on me.  Why?  Because your actions define the person that you are.  Just like a Chrisitain who leads a Chrisitain way of life, that's what makes him a Chrsitian, right?<br><br>With regards to Ozzy Osborne, that's my point.  Why hate when it doesn't affect your life?  Why was the African American hated so much when he hasn't done a thing to hurt his Caucasian counterpart?  Who's blaming who?  Do you feel blamed?<br><br>And considering this is the lesbians thread, I remember asking why is it that we can accept or even encourage (well, some guys here do, we both know that) seeing or experiencing it and not include them in the discrimination?  why do we focus on male and not female homosexuality in our discrimination?<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>

Sincere sorries for that, But still i condemn homosexuality but not homosexuals and I am sure I did that and the homosexuals i came in contact with would agree with me. As for context, i always use homosexuals to represent gays and lesbians, not just gays. I have no double standards. I am clear on what i can accept and what i cannot. Just as much as i condemn homosexuality i do not go ard scolding homosexuals that what they are doing is wrong, i onli will express my views if they ask me or comes to me for advice. I do not force my views on pple as in i do not expect homosexuals to change just because of my views. And these homosexuals they perfectly know I treat as any other person unless of course they try to force it on me and for that matter, if any one tries to force a view on me, i will reject it, not just on this homosexuality issue. TO me, being a homosexual does not make useless, does not make them contribute lesser to society, does not make them a pest to society, it is just that they engage in an activity that is wrong to me. And as far as i know, homosexuals are willing to accept that as long we do not condemn them as a person.</div>

Maybe your toothache had something to do with it.<br><br>I must admit I've been very form on my stance since I've seen heaps of discrimination around me in my time.  whilst studying here, I personally witnessed gay bashings.  Asians were discriminated simply because we have the same coloured skin as the Vietnamese, and we're all rolled up into one eneralisation that we killed so many people in the Vietnam War.  Can you believe that?  Singaporean Chinese being discriminated against for a war we nor our fathers never partook in.  And when asked for a reason, we're told that all Asians are the same, simply because of how we look.  Personally, that didn't make sense.  Sexual discriminatoin is another thing I saw around me, not just of women but of men too.  Homosexuality, from where I was mainly educated, is treated differently, thus my different view.  Not saying it's right nor wrong, just different.  But such things are so grey, which implies there is a need for more study to better understand it.  Thus my so-called 'doggingness'.<br><br>I'm just against discrimination of all kinds without good logical reasoning.  When people say they hate homosexuality, I just want to know why.  I ask questions.  They give all sorts of reasons, ranging from religion to the way they were brought up.  So I always try to compare situations (just like you have) to see how their bring ups would treat it.  Apples with apples, mind you.  I'm wanting to see if moral values have been given a herd-like treatment, y'know, the 'if you don't follow it, you're not part of the group' kind of thing.<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>

Not your average just go there for a couple of years to get that piece of paper kind of thing.  Going back in about a year for sevral years.  Aaah... the unforgivingness of the Aussie outback, here I come...  How long were youse in Perth?<br><br>Hmmm...  Okay, let's get something else clear, mate.  I'm not supporting homosexuality.  I reckon I did mention that earlier.  I'm just saying not to discriminate it.  Fine, we got our likes and dislikes, but we have seen gay bashings but not smoker bashings, aye?  And if you or anyone is against it, I'd just like to know why.  You've given your reasons.  But it's only natural for me to ask more questions.  Like your experience with the bouncer at Perth, if you had ask him, 'Do you personally think that's right if we did the same for all Caucasians in our countries?  '  I reckon the look on his face would be priceless.  There is nothing more disarming than being asked questions that you feel it'd be illogical to use the same reasons you give people.<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>
