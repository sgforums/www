              <p>We thought of that, I think cooking-wise shouldn't be a problem because she's a really good cook.</p>
              <p>But I'm not sure of how that should happen, need to find out about a lot of things, like rental pricing, location, what food to sell and etc. Need to figure out where to start haha.</p>

              <p>If your suggesting that I find work for her in bar or pub, I would prefer that she work a day job, that's what she prefers as well (we actually talked about this before) so we can have time together after our day jobs.</p>
              <p>Reason why I wanted her to work is because, I think it would be easier for her to blend into our society. It's mostly based on my own experience because during my work life, I met many people, all sorts of people and learned many things. Actually sending her to school is also an option, I think she may get the same exposure as with working. It was suggested by one of my friends, but I'll talk to her more about this.</p>
              <p>There are quite a few reasons why I wanted her to work:</p>
              <p>1. I work, she work, we more money.</p>
              <p>2. Mentioned before, probably a good of chance of exposure for her.</p>
              <p>3. If she's working here, I think it'll help her to keep in mind that making money is not easy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks for your question, please let me know if I have anything that you feel I should know.</p>

              <p>No problem, our pubs do open in day time for those desparate early birds dudes, so if she can do some bartending, serving and with dancing experiences such as laptop, bartop coyote or pole will be much better, and i bet she will earn more than you.</p>
              <p>But is if you sound out her like those innocent type, you better becareful in letting her working, cos once she knews about the society, the rich and famous, or the hunks and partying dudes, you may lose her ya.</p>
              <p>I have thai gals here too, hope she can be one of their sisters, some already married off to rich singapore towkay or become mistress with Cards, Car and condos..</p>
