              <p>My Thai girlfriend is coming to Singapore in late June.</p>
              <p>She is 25 and has completed her upper secondary education in Thailand (Mattayom 6).</p>
              <p>Her work experience is mostly in retail sales (sell clothing) in Thailand and she has never worked in Singapore before.</p>
              <p>Her English is okay, can read a little, can say quite okay.</p>
              <p>She don't mind long hours or low pay (I'm mostly sponsoring her anyway).</p>
              <p>My intention is for her to work in Singapore, get used to the life here, make some friends, and hopefully we can start a family here. Just a side-note, it's not her first time visiting Singapore, when she came for the first few times, it's mostly a holiday trip for her.</p>
              <p>Just a few more questions:</p>
              <p>1. After some browsing at the MOM site, and looking at her qualifications and also that she isn't skilled, I think she can at most get a Work Permit. So for the WP, does she have to apply at MOM or the prospective employer will apply for her?</p>
              <p>2. Lodging-wise, will it be a problem if she's staying with me when she's trying to obtain a Work Permit? I mean, does it even matter as long as she has a permanent residence i.e. my house?</p>
              <p>3. Does anyone know of a community forum for Thais working in Singapore, where they can share their experience working and living in Singapore?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your kind response would be deeply appreciated. Thanks.</p>

              <p>She got any bar and pub services experiences.</p>

              <p>If your suggesting that I find work for her in bar or pub, I would prefer that she work a day job, that's what she prefers as well (we actually talked about this before) so we can have time together after our day jobs.</p>
              <p>Reason why I wanted her to work is because, I think it would be easier for her to blend into our society. It's mostly based on my own experience because during my work life, I met many people, all sorts of people and learned many things. Actually sending her to school is also an option, I think she may get the same exposure as with working. It was suggested by one of my friends, but I'll talk to her more about this.</p>
              <p>There are quite a few reasons why I wanted her to work:</p>
              <p>1. I work, she work, we more money.</p>
              <p>2. Mentioned before, probably a good of chance of exposure for her.</p>
              <p>3. If she's working here, I think it'll help her to keep in mind that making money is not easy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks for your question, please let me know if I have anything that you feel I should know.</p>

              <p>Yes I did.</p>
              <p>But i also thought of my life there, the basic of modern day survival i.e. money?</p>
              <p>I compared similar positions in Thailand but the salary is way too low than what I am getting here.</p>
              <p>And also, I don't have the financial power to just dump everything here and live in Thailand.</p>
              <p>So I guess I'll still stay here and work.</p>

              <p>Yes, the policy still holds i.e. Marriage Restriction Policy.</p>
              <p>That's why right now, after some advise from a few friends and my family, me and her have decided that she will come simply for a holiday.</p>
              <p>And just to update, NTUC Fairprice said that under MOM's regulations,</p>
              <p>
              </p><p>"<em>Thailand is not an approved source country for work permit applications in the service sector.</em></p>
              <p><em>As for S Pass applications, MOM generally requires the candidate to possess degree or diploma level educational qualifications.</em></p>
              <p><em>Thus we will not be able to consider the following candidate.</em>"</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>We can try to apply for marriage if she does get a WP but I'm not sure about the evaluation of application for marriage in such cases, what MOM look at, what we need to have and etc. Since I can sponsor her, I see no point to take a risk.</p>
