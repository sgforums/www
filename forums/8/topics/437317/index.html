I have a huge amount of free time after work and I am thinking of taking up a part time job. Reason why I am going for that is because I wanted to accumulate more wealth for my upcoming marriage and new house.<br><br>I tried equity investment for the past few months; read up some books, attended some investment talks, chat up with me friends who invested heavily in equity; but at the end of the day, I still feel that it is not for me.<br><br>So after some research, I found out that real estate agent might be a good idea for me as I heard that one could be a part time RE agent and work probably from 7-10pm daily. However, I am lack of other details such as, will I always have to be in a team and trying to meet the target? Or I could be an one man team and act on my own time own target?<br><br>Also, which agency is more suitable for part time agent? As I saw most of the advertisement stated that their agency is the best and choosing an agency is very crucial for a new starting out agent.<br><br>Well, I am also open to suggestion on any other part time job that I could take up. I have finance/account/audit background and currently also in the same field.<br><br>Thanks everyone for your time and appreciate if you could give me some advice. Cheers!</span></p></div>

              <p>not so much abt the agency as it is just for u to be registered legally to be an agent.</p>
              <p>it's more of your own contacts and whether u are willing to spend the $$ to print ads, post in the papers. </p>
              <p>the agency will not be funding all these.</p>

              <p>take note also of the increasing restrictions and compliance of RE agents....esp. advertising...the law is crawling on many agents' back for undercutting, illegal ads &amp; pamphlets, and many more ethical inquiries....do beware of the legal issues facing agents as well...</p>
              <p>however, if you have great passion for the field, nothing's gonna stop u...but part time is rarely a success as compared to full commitment...depends on what you are after....surely never quit your main job if u r not VERY sure...</p>
              <p>RE is not a 7pm to 10 pm routine...that mindset is a job mindset than an entrepreneurial think..your customers would want to see the properties at any time....</p>

              <p>hey, i'm also trying to do it part time and did some research on the various agencies. honestly, it really depends on your needs and preference la. for me, i am inclined towards orange-tee after i spoke with them. if you wanna speak with them and find out more, i can link you up. ;)</p>
                  <p>btw, do note that we have to take an RES exam hor. i'm currently preparing for it and saw someone post this link to a website that has lotsa practice questions, like 10-year series. <br>i find it very useful la, so maybe you can check it 
                  </p><p>Cheers!</p>
