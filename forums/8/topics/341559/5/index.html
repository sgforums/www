              <p><strong>Singapore Flyer to remain closed pending investigations</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The world's largest observation wheel, the Singapore
              Flyer, will be closed until investigations into Tuesday's incident are
              complete. <br> <br> A major power disruption left 173 passengers stranded for about six hours.
              <br> <br> Police say operations will be allowed to resume once the ride is certified safe.
              <br> <br> All trapped passengers were able to leave their capsules after the
              Singapore Flyer resumed rotating at about 11:11pm (1511 GMT) on
              Tuesday. </span></p>
              <p><span>Earlier, a few passengers were lowered down to safety in a sling-like device from one of the observation capsules. 
              <br> <br> A 59-year-old woman complaining of dizziness, and a boy who vomited
              were taken to hospital, said Lieutenant Colonel N. Subhas, of the
              Singapore Civil Defence Force.</span></p>
              <p><span>A spokeswoman for the attraction said about 173 people were
              onboard the wheel when a short circuit in one of the drive motors
              occurred at around 5:00pm.
              <br> <br>At least five passengers were lifted through the hatch on top of
              each capsule and winched to the ground by a private rescue firm engaged
              by Singapore Flyer.
              <br> <br>The Flyer's technical team managed to isolate the problem and
              restored electricity, including the air-conditioning, to the capsules.
              The team also worked with the Singapore Civil Defence Force to resolve
              the problem.
              <br> <br> Those stranded were provided with food and drink.
              <br> <br>Mr Steven Yeo, General Manager of the Singapore Flyer, said: "At
              4.50pm, we experienced an electrical problem on our drive unit number
              1, north unit, which caused several of our electrical supplies to be
              cut. The defect has actually been isolated. We found it to be the drive
              unit itself. The rest of the wheel, the rest of the supply, is in full
              functioning order at the moment."
              <br> <br>A passenger who was stuck in one of the capsules said there was a
              sudden jerk before the wheel stopped turning. An announcement a few
              minutes later said there was a technical error.
              <br> <br>Madam Lim Boon Siang, a passenger stuck in one of the capsules,
              said: "About 4.30pm or 4.15pm, after we passed the maximum altitude, it
              suddenly jerked to a stop, and then for a good five to 10 minutes, we
              waited. <br> <br> "We thought that this could be something normal. And then there was a
              message that came in that said that it has stopped temporary. Everybody
              was calm, but initially the air-con was switched off, so it was very
              hot due to the evening sun. They opened up the air ventilator, and the
              air-con is working now."
              <br> <br> She said there were about 10 other people, including children, in her cabin.
              <br> <br>The spokesperson said: "Their safety was never at risk while they
              were in the capsules. Every capsule is equipped with an intercom system
              which is linked to the control room - for passengers and the control
              room personnel to communicate.
              <br> <br>"Our staff promptly informed passengers of the situation and
              reassured them that measures were being taken to fix the technical
              problem. There are also surveillance cameras installed in every capsule
              for the operations team to monitor what is going on in all capsules."
              <br> <br>Singapore Flyer has reimbursed all affected passengers for their
              tickets and is making alternative transport arrangements for travellers
              who missed their flights to Europe and coaches to Malaysia.
              <br> <br>A ride on the 165-metre tall wheel, about 42 storeys high,
              typically takes half an hour and each capsule can take up to 28 people. </span></p>
              <p><span>Since the Flyer became operational in February this year, this is the third time it has encountered problems.
              <br> <br> The last time a technical glitch occurred was just three weeks ago, on
              December 4. The wheel was stuck for nearly five hours due to extreme
              weather conditions and some 70 people were affected. In July, the Flyer
              stopped due to a minor fault in the braking system. <br> <br> Unlike cramped, old-style Ferris wheel carriages that hang in the open
              air, the Singapore Flyer and other large observation wheels feature
              fixed "capsules". <br> <br> The 28 sleek-looking capsules - about the size of a city bus - can hold
              up to 28 people, and passengers can walk around during the
              slowly-moving ride.
              <br> <br>The Singapore Flyer, worth about S$240 million (US$171 million),
              was a private venture backed mainly by German investors and built by
              Mitsubishi Corp and Takenaka Corp of Japan.
              <br> <br>Singapore-based Great Wheel Corp is also building wheels in Beijing
              and Berlin, which will edge out the Singapore Flyer as the world's
              biggest when they begin turning in about two years, the chairman of
              Singapore Flyer, Florian Bollen, said before the attraction opened. -

              <p><br>SINGAPORE: The New Year's Countdown Dance Party, which was to have taken place at the world's largest floating platform, has been cancelled.</p>
              <p>Organiser MediaCorp said the decision to cancel <a href="mailto:Party@The">Party@The</a> Float, to be held at Marina Bay, was due to poor ticket sales.</p>
              <p>Tickets for the party had gone on sale on November 28 for S$28, which includes one drink.</p>
              <p>But only a few hundred tickets were sold.</p>
              <p>Those who have bought tickets using their credit cards will automatically get a full refund.</p>
              <p>For those who used NETs or cash, refunds can be made at all Sistic outlets.</p>
              <p>Details are available at sistic.com.sg</p>
              <p>The star-studded "Marina Bay Singapore Countdown 2009" however, will go on as planned at 10.30pm on New Year's Eve.</p>
              <p>The warm-up pre-show starts at 9pm.</p>

              <p><strong>Singapore Flyer will not resume operations till after the new year</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : The Singapore Flyer observation wheel will not resume commercial operations for at least another week.
              <br> <br> Its management is currently investigating the exact cause of the
              wheel's failure, which trapped 173 people for nearly seven hours on
              Tuesday night. </span></p>
              <p><span>The company said it could take some time to fix the problem. But
              it would also take time for a round of safety checks and getting the
              green light to re-start operations.
              <br> <br>A day after the harrowing experience of visitors being winched down
              from the Singapore Flyer, the tourists still came by the bus loads to
              catch a ride on the wheel, unaware of the closure.
              <br> <br>One tourist said: "I have been searching on the internet, and it
              said the first thing I would like to do when I come to Singapore (is to
              go on the Singapore Flyer). When I came here, I was so frustrated. (I
              have come) all the way from United States."
              <br> <br>Another tourist commented: "I already applied for leave and I
              decided to come over today... I wasted my time rushing over here." <br> <br> Even as repairs are being carried out, the Singapore Flyer's operator
              has assured the public that the wheel is safe. But for those thinking
              of going up on it, do not expect it to happen anytime soon, at least
              not until after the new year.
              <br> <br>That means the closure will have an impact on the tenants here. The
              management said it will be meeting the tenants to discuss the current
              situation.
              <br> <br>The operator also declined to reveal how much it will lose because
              of this closure. But losses are estimated to be in the hundreds of
              thousands of dollars.
              <br> <br>Steven Yeo, general manager, Singapore Flyer, said: "We have spoken
              to our corporate clients, they have confirmed their support for us.
              They have requested to reschedule their bookings to a later date." <br> <br> But while most tenants are seeing empty stores for now, one restaurant seems to be bucking the trend.
              <br> <br> Vinod Jakhmola, senior unit manager, SSP Singapore, said: "Whatever
              situation it is, it is for a short while. It will move on and we have
              to move further than that. In case of business, this is a lovely
              destination. People will still come back for the food outlets and
              definitely for the rides also."
              <br> <br>The Flyer's operator also revealed that its recent decision to
              reverse the rotation of the wheel was not a factor in the latest
              breakdown. <br> <br> In fact, it was a component failure which resulted in a small fire, and
              that caused a power outage, shutting down the entire system.
              <br> <br>Mr Yeo said even though the small fire was put out in minutes, it
              had caused certain problems in the circuitry board, which as a result,
              had to be taken out for repairs.
              <br> <br>However, even when the repairs are completed and safety checks
              done, the operator will still have to get the go-ahead from the police
              for the all-clear. - CNA/ms </span></p>
