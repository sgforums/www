            <div class='col-md body'>I a big time fan of japanese dramas,and I can't help but feel that your story has alot of similaries to summer snow,a female version perhap?I like the concept but I think the part where the two person met could be spiced up abit like having more coincidences thrown in.Hijikata does not have to be overridden with guilt,noriko death is an accident,but the flame of love still live in his heart and her memories will alway be a part of him.The strong point should be in the dairy,maybe you could elaborate farther about the hope and dream that she had written and what Hijikata did to fulfil them(Something like beautiful life if you know what I mean).Are you a smap fan by any chance,I could tell by the way you describe the vocals <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>------------------------<br><strong>If you are looking for trouble,I help you find it</strong><br>( ^o^)=o (-_- )<br>( ^o^)==o (-_- )<br>( ^o^)====o(-_- )<br>( ^o^)======*_- )<br>( ^o^)====o(x_- )<br>( ^o^)==o (x_- )<br>( ^o^)o (x_- )<br></div>
