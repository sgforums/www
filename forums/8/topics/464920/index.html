              <p>Thanks for this. Yup I wanted to end the things 
                  faster. And you are right, we did not have much to fight for, except for an
                   HDB flat, for which I was not claiming the ownership, and was willing 
                  to transfer. (However she went for appeal with hues and cries over the 
                  money she has been asked to pay, despite the court had split the 
                  notional profit as 70% for my ex).</p>
              <p>Reason, why I didn't want to 
                  hire a lawyer is, I know my case very well, and my sincererity would be 
                  superior to a lawyer. All the things that I need to know were available 
                  from the statutes which are online, and from the rules and regulations, 
                  and practice guidances of courts which are again online. Appeals' annual
                   reports available in library was also useful for the practicality and 
                  examples. I did pretty well without a lawyer.</p>
              <p>For those who wants to know why I want to know how she much spends: I am weighing her weakness and power, as she may make my rest of my life misreable by repeated claims and complaints under women's charter. (This is another reason why I did not want to hire a lawyer, as I need to learn this game to face all along my life, else I will be made bankrupt through lawyer fees.) If it turns out that she pays lot, I can use her that stress, to buy her attention and make her listen to the issues more carefully.</p>
              <p>(Btw, if anyone is acting in peron (self represented), pm me, we can share knowledge).</p>

              <p>Yes, I agree. But what can I do with a women who don't even talk

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Thanks for this. Yup I wanted to end the things faster. And you
              are right, we did not have much to fight for, except for an HDB
              flat, for which I was not claiming the ownership, and was willing
              to transfer. (However she went for appeal with hues and cries over
              the money she has been asked to pay, despite the court had split
              the notional profit as 70% for my ex).</p>
              <p>Reason, why I didn't want to hire a lawyer is, I know my case
              very well, and my sincererity would be superior to a lawyer. All
              the things that I need to know were available from the statutes
              which are online, and from the rules and regulations, and practice
              guidances of courts which are again online. Appeals' annual reports
              available in library was also useful for the practicality and
              examples. I did pretty well without a lawyer.</p>
              <p>For those who wants to know why I want to know how she much
              spends: I am weighing her weakness and power, as she may make my
              rest of my life misreable by repeated claims and complaints under
              women's charter. (This is another reason why I did not want to hire
              a lawyer, as I need to learn this game to face all along my life,
              else I will be made bankrupt through lawyer fees.) If it turns out
              that she pays lot, I can use her that stress, to buy her attention
              and make her listen to the issues more carefully.</p>
              <p>(Btw, if anyone is acting in peron (self represented), pm me, we
              can share knowledge).</p>
              </div>

              <p>Woman's Charter is a bitch eh. Man I feel you.  Legal fee's can make you go broke, and looks like you have carefully weighted your options in representing yourself, I think. Damn lawyers.. :P You know, your nice guy method may even work in your favour. Hope you really know what u are doing.</p>
              <p>Make sure you make the right submissions at the right time. All the best !</p>
