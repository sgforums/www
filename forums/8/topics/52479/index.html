            <div class='col-md body'>the only time i set my phone to ringing alert is when i am at home. as soon as i get out of home, it is on vibration.<br><br>so like you i simply cannot stand people who simply ignores all calls for handphones to be switched to silent mode. been to many meetings and forums when phones go off. are these people simply inconsiderate, dont care, or plain stupid?<br><br>those microwave jamming devices will come in really handy.</div>
