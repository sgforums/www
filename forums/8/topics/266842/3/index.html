If you were against prostitution you wouldn't walk into a brothel would you? If I had a gf I wouldn't even let another girl get naked in my bedroom would I?<br><br>The way I see it is -<br><br>Consumer point of view: The dish is controversial and I know how the fish is served yet I still choose to order it anyway and eat it while it's still alive.<br><br>Cook's point of view: I have to put another creature through intense pain and serve it to people who will eat it while it's still alive yet I choose to do so with this knowledge.<br><br>And you misunderstand my last statement. What I meant was that you can't say that you have to have the dish in front of you and you're very hungry then could you say you're against it, we're against it and we can say people who eat it are wrong in doing so because they have prior knowledge before having the dish in front of them. If they're hungry they could always eat something else but they eat the fish even though they know the amount of suffering it goes through.</div></blockquote>u still do not get it. like i said, u have never been in the situation, therefore, u do not have the right to proclaim moral superiority over other human beings.<br><br>wat u r doing is just shutting off the source before u even have a chance. who is to say that u can do the same thing when u have the chance?<br><br>apparently, u did not read about the prison experiment, did u?</div>
