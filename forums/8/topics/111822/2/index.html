The reverse is true. I'm actually giving money to you people.<br><br>Not only did I pledge hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to your region, I also contributed one helicopter. Take a look at the padi fields of Aceh and you can see the chopper lying down somewhere around there. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Oh, and that was a nice trick to get a baffalo to run across the Aceh airport runway while one of our planes was landing.
