            <div class='col-md body'>the genome across species such as pigs, cows, bears, mouse and human shows different forms of arrangement of the same 'building blocks'...by inversion, fission, fusion etc.<br><br>In other words, for example there are 5 basic blocks namely A,B,C,D,E. all species's chromosomal material are derived from these five and differ in their arrangment. Human for instance have BCDEA arrangment while a pig has ABADEC arrangement.<br><br>I believe it is the work of One Creator who uses these building blocks and create all kinds of animals and human.<br><br></div>

Ranging from sperm cells, liver cells to brain cells and many others. What differ a liver cell and red blood cell is simply the switching off of genes that codes for liver cell traits in RBC and vice versa. All cells has the potential to become another and this requires specific gene regulation. a skin cell dry and flaky as it seems has the same as genetic content as red blood cells and from above we see that genes being regulated ca result in vast difference. how can this happen?<br><br>Divine intervention is my logic.</div>

Darwin simply stated that it was not impossible that man shared a common progenitor with all other mammals, not just monkeys and apes. In any case, Darwin was not the originator of the theories that he postulated, nor did he ever claim to be, openly acknowledging the fact that many others, his own grandfather, Eramus included, had already trod on the same path. Darwin himself nominates Aristotle as the father of the theory. Incidentally, the book in which Darwin deals with the origins of man is not <span style="font-style: italic;">The Origin of the Species</span>, but <span style="font-style: italic;">The Descent of Man</span>.<br><br>Darwin's great contribution was a new and more concrete theory on the modification of the species. He named the principle 'natural selection' but later chose to adopt the name Herbert Spencer gave it - 'survival of the fittest'.<br><br><strong>Finding Three</strong> - Rabbits are related closer to human than to rodents.<br><br>Ending notes. Poor Darwin. Not only is his theories mixed up, his books are also mixed up. Even the common myth on 'survival of the fittest' also got misconceptions mind you.</div>
