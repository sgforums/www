That's if you just believe in science. That's if you're an atheist.<br><br>If you believe in religion, humans either die and go to heaven/hell or die and be reincarnated. But if one dies and goes to heaven/hell, what's the point of living so long...? Just so that you can spend your life doing good deeds and the such to ensure your passport to heaven/do bad deeds and be banished to hell? If you believe in reincarnation, everything becomes a cycle which there is no end in itself.<br><br>I'm just offering a very simplistic view..

For some, it may be to impact people's lives. For some, it may be to be some famous people. Some may just wan to be a good person. Even an atheist aims to just live.

Its up to the individuals really.<br><br>First Cause- Every true scientist admits that something cannot come from nothing. I was told that the universe started with a big bang that was caused by colliding planets. My question was, and still is, "Where did the planets that banged together come from?" Who made them? It is certain that they did not come from nothing! They had to have a cause. Whatever the beginning of the universe was Â– it had to be caused. The "planet wreck" view is no longer being taught. Now the big bang is said to have occurred when there was no time, space, or matter. In other words, nothing blew up! If this were true, what was the cause?<br><br>The First Cause had to be big enough, and wise enough to cause the universe to happen. I believe that the First Cause is the God of the Bible. What else could there be? Evolution only offers a weak and unproved theory that supposes that nothing came from nowhere and produced the beginnings of life accidentally.<br><br>The Second Law of Thermodynamics insists that naturally, objects tend to decay over time. The Theory of Evolution supposes that from a gigantic explosion , things got better. In fact, the theory suggests that life was formed from a random catastrophe! Unbelievable, isnÂ’t it?<br><br>Mitosis Â– Single celled life forms divide themselves and thereby reproduce. I was taught that these single celled life forms one day invented sexual reproduction. ItÂ’s hard to believe that a single celled piece of life could think up THAT isnÂ’t it? And what could a little neuter single cell life form do with its newfound knowledge? A cell that didnÂ’t have a brain, lips, or hands invented sexual reproduction? ThatÂ’s what the teacher said. Amazing, since those cells couldnÂ’t even kiss!<br><br>Fixity of Species- Chromosomes determine the species of a baby. The mother contributes half of a babyÂ’s chromosomes. The father gives the other half. Dogs have 22 chromosomes. People have 46. A monkey has 54. The number of chromosomes fixes the species. (Genes determine what the baby looks like, within its species.) The chromosomal order does not lie or change. That is what real science, and the Bible, says.<br><br>"And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good." Â–Genesis 1:25<br><br>Evolution supposes that the chromosomal order jumps around and changes any way it pleases. A fish changes to a crocodile. Monkey to man. Fixity of species would stop evolution in its tracks.<br><br>The Missing Link Â–LetÂ’s ignore the facts for a moment and assume with evolutionists that a fish became a crocodile. How many years would it take? A hundred? Thousands? Millions? In all those years of changes, how many animals died? There should be skeletons everywhere having part fish and part crocodile characteristics. There are none. This is true of every species. There are plenty of terminals, but no partials. Missing link? Somebody stole the whole chain!<br><br></div></blockquote>Many of your so-called 'scientific' arguements are flawed. Do try www.talkorigins.org if you are interested to know why. You love to argue in a rhetorical sense, using exaggerations and ignoring facts that do no fit your own theory. Science is not a tool to prove that your 'God' does not exist. You do not have to be paranoid about science.<br><br>1st point: The Big Bang was not a result of a collision of 2 planets. Sheesh. Where did you hear that from?<br><br>Don't take the term literally. The BB is not an explosion in the conventional sense. Visit this to clearify your thoughts. http://www.superstringtheory.com/cosmo/cosmo3.html<br><br>2nd point: Yes. Life did occur randomly. Let's put this in a analogy.<br><br>We shall equate every chemical reaction to a roll of a dice with say 1000 trillion sides. The sides are the possible results of a reaction and only 1 of this 1000 trillion results in a self replicating molecule that can develop into life.<br><br>Next, we must keep in mind that many of reactions takes place simultaneously. Especially in places with water. Let us be conservation and put the number of simultaneous reactions be 1 million.<br><br>Now at any moment there is 1:1 billion chance to result in life.<br><br>Think about how old the universe is. Factor that in. The probability of life becomes very high.<br><br>There, you have it, the close to O probability is having life is matched by the close to infinite number of times it attempted.<br><br>The evidence of evolution is all around you. Look at your eyes. Do you notice a lump of flesh on the side close to your nose. That was your 3rd eyelid that have receded. If humans were created by a perfect design why would be have a feature that is being discarded.<br><br>Seen an X-ray of your spine? Ever thought why there is a stub of bone there? That sir, is your tail. Since the Homo Erectus learned to walk we have no use of the tail. It will gradually disappear too.<br><br>By the way. Fishes did not evolve into crocs. That is a flawed assumption when evolution was not not so clearly understood. Life evolved in many stages. One cannot compare 1 stage to another.<br><br>To understand better, let us see how us, the Homo Sapien is classified.<br><br>metabolic organism<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"><br>eukaryote<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"><br>animal<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"><br>chordate<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"><br>vertebrate<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"><br>tetrapod<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"><br>synapsid<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"><br>mammal<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"><br>eutherian<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"><br>primate<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"><br>ape</div>

Neo-Darwinian evolution lacks empirical support (transitional specimens?); extrapolation from microevolution (special theory of evolution; emphirically valid and bibilcally agreeable) sensibly fails to render it a 'fact' and in the absence of a suitable replacement for the Darwinist's paradigm means it must not be abandoned for reasons political or more, no matter that Mayr's successor-Gould acknowledged Neo-Darwinism "effectively dead" as a general theory. Has knowledge 'evolved' to become belief?<br><br>Scripture informs us that the truths concerning the existence and character of God have always been self-evident to mankind through the book of nature, even to the ungodly and unrighteous - those "who suppress the truth by their wickedness, since what may be known about God is plain to them; because God has made it plain to them. For since the creation of the world God's invisible attributes - his eternal power and divine nature - have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that they are without any excuse."
