            <div class='col-md body'>Lets look at why evolution can be hard to believe. Its up to the individuals really.<br><br>First Cause- Every true scientist admits that something cannot come from nothing. I was told that the universe started with a big bang that was caused by colliding planets. My question was, and still is, "Where did the planets that banged together come from?" Who made them? It is certain that they did not come from nothing! They had to have a cause. Whatever the beginning of the universe was Â– it had to be caused. The "planet wreck" view is no longer being taught. Now the big bang is said to have occurred when there was no time, space, or matter. In other words, nothing blew up! If this were true, what was the cause?<br><br>The First Cause had to be big enough, and wise enough to cause the universe to happen. I believe that the First Cause is the God of the Bible. What else could there be? Evolution only offers a weak and unproved theory that supposes that nothing came from nowhere and produced the beginnings of life accidentally.<br><br>The Second Law of Thermodynamics insists that naturally, objects tend to decay over time. The Theory of Evolution supposes that from a gigantic explosion , things got better. In fact, the theory suggests that life was formed from a random catastrophe! Unbelievable, isnÂ’t it?<br><br>Mitosis Â– Single celled life forms divide themselves and thereby reproduce. I was taught that these single celled life forms one day invented sexual reproduction. ItÂ’s hard to believe that a single celled piece of life could think up THAT isnÂ’t it? And what could a little neuter single cell life form do with its newfound knowledge? A cell that didnÂ’t have a brain, lips, or hands invented sexual reproduction? ThatÂ’s what the teacher said. Amazing, since those cells couldnÂ’t even kiss!<br><br>Fixity of Species- Chromosomes determine the species of a baby. The mother contributes half of a babyÂ’s chromosomes. The father gives the other half. Dogs have 22 chromosomes. People have 46. A monkey has 54. The number of chromosomes fixes the species. (Genes determine what the baby looks like, within its species.) The chromosomal order does not lie or change. That is what real science, and the Bible, says.<br><br>"And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good." Â–Genesis 1:25<br><br>Evolution supposes that the chromosomal order jumps around and changes any way it pleases. A fish changes to a crocodile. Monkey to man. Fixity of species would stop evolution in its tracks.<br><br>The Missing Link Â–LetÂ’s ignore the facts for a moment and assume with evolutionists that a fish became a crocodile. How many years would it take? A hundred? Thousands? Millions? In all those years of changes, how many animals died? There should be skeletons everywhere having part fish and part crocodile characteristics. There are none. This is true of every species. There are plenty of terminals, but no partials. Missing link? Somebody stole the whole chain!<br><br></div>
