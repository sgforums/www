            <div class='col-md body'>Well, all what I was trying to say is that, you question, while pertinent, you may or may not have realized, is yet the most irrevelent.<br><br>True enough, many people have their reasons for rejecting religon or athiesm, but all I appeal for is that if you want to get scientific about your points of views, consider then, the larger implications of the questions you are asking.<br><br>In the end, the question you have asked is pretty irrevelent, is like asking could T.rex exceed 40km/h or not.<br><br>Well, first we need to know that truth is truth, and no amount of reasoning, scientific theories and what you or I say is going to change that. Hence forth, science does not define truth, but rather it discovers truth.<br><br>One also needs to know that science is a tool, it is not an omnipotent tool that we can use to discover whatever we want. If anything, science is simply a structured way of understanding our universe, and being a person interested in science, I realize that science is a VERY limited and finite way of understanding the universe and truth.<br><br>Hence forth, back to the T.rex question, lets say that most of our scientific evidence points towards T.rex running slower then 40kph, with tons of theories for pseudo-paleontologists like Jack Horner, biomechnical studies and observations that are "easier" to believe. But if an actual T.rex is capable of running above 40kph, no matter how rational or easy to believe our theories may be. They are wrong.<br><br>One needs to look back into the history of science to realize that at no point anyone had ever said that they have arrived at one point of truth and declared "THIS MUST BE IT! THE END, FULL STOP!" If anything, we have had more questions about the world then when we started out with.<br><br>As I said, to idolize and put our faith in science, is ultimately and ironically... unscientific... to say that Darwin is easier to believe without considering all the evidence is unscientific, to give his theories a passing glaze and make a conclusion is unscientific, and worse, to use Darwin's conclusions to shape and define our naked observations (of which many of us on both sides are guilty of) is unscientific.<br><br>In the end, science... is just a tool. We use this tool to do a job, and that is discovery. We do not get hung up on the tool and start defining our entire lives by it.<br><br>Ultimately there are several things I can observe about this universe and to a limited extent, observe.<br><br>Our universe is finite, it is limited physically and governed by laws.<br><br>Everything in our universe has to have a cause to exist, that is, something must cause them to exist. Dust forming planets, stars, the like.<br><br>We are by nature, highly limited and finite things, hence forth our view of truth and the universe is greatly finite as well.<br><br>These are my conclusions:<br><br>Hence, ultimately a finite universe but be caused to exist... it cannot simply exist and the laws simply cannot define ourselves.<br><br>Ultimately all finites entities will have to be caused, and if we backtrack them all the way back, we realize that in the end, we need one infinite source that does not require to have a cause to start the ball rolling.<br><br>This is the first cause, the first cause must logically must be omnipotent and infinite (does not require anything to start it rolling) What exactly this first cause is, I leave it up to you to debate as it's beyond the scope of this post. Unfortunately, this first cause is obviously not subject to our laws of physics or universe, and hence cannot be comprehensively known or discovered through systems that are using these natural laws. Science is one of them.<br><br>Therefore, we cannot find out about this first cause using science as it would obviously be unscientific and the results gathered would not suffice.<br><br>What to make of it? In the end, one needs to realize that we are not just here for here's sake. Something caused all this entire reality into being, and no matter how far we backtrack, we realize that in the end something ultimate, that does not require to be caused to exist put all this finite system into motion.<br><br>This is no longer in the realm of science, it is in the realm of faith. We are by nature creatures of faith, no matter if you believe in God or not, everybody requires faith to function. That is because we can never know anything for sure.<br><br>Athiests have many ideas on what this first cause can be (and the theories can be pretty funky), but for me, I believe that an intelligent omnipotent creator created all this that we call reality, and there is never a way I can understand Him through science and logic, but most of my understanding of Him is via faith.<br><br>Science however, can give us somtimes a quick qlimspe into the unknown, consider the following quote from Chet Raymo, an astronomer and science writer:<br><br>Consider the following. If one second after the Big Banf, the ratio of the density of the universe to its expansion rate had differed from its assumed value by only one part in 10 followed by 15 zeros, the universe would have either quickly collasped upon itself or balloned so rapidly that stars and galasies could not have condenses from the primal matter... The coin was flipped 10,000,000,000,000,000 times and it came down on its edge but once. If all the grains of sand on all the beaches of the Earth were possible universes-- that is, universes consistent with the laws of physics as we know them-- and only one of those grains of sand were a universe that allowed for the esistence of intelligent life, then that one grain of sand is the universe we inhabit.<br><br>Go figure, the observations are there, the conclusions are for you to make...<br><br>Simple creation versus evolution thread? I believe the true issue goes way deeper.<br><br></div>
