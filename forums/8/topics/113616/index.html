            <div class='col-md body'>Jane use to be rebellious, and throw tempers easily at home.. she was sad that her parents wasn't earning enough money so that they can have a better life.. being the eldest in the family, vacation means working part-time to substain what-ever little money she earn to contribute household expense..<br><br>She was used to being left out from her peers, where most of them can have anythings they want in life.. be it a nitendo, barbie dolls, or rotting at home during school holidays.. She hate about everything, and lament why life was so un-fair to her...<br><br>She had never been to any country before, not even JB.. passport to her was redundant.. Home was a small 65sq m, which she have to squeeze with her younger brother and sister.. It doesn't give her any room of privacy, and she often cry herself to bed..<br><br>When she was in JC, life took a turn for the worse when her dad die of cancer.. she was in a cross road , whether to continue her studies or start working.. she knew there was not much choice for her..<br><br>When her teacher learn of her plight, he introduce her a part-time job as a property agent.. he encourage her and was always around whenever she need a helping hand.. Through her hard work, she finally manage to complete her JC and was also the company's top housing agent..<br><br>Today, although she boast of a landed property in CBD area, she remain humble.. speaking through a seminal, she said.. " If im not strong and independant, i could end up in a night-club or worse, be a prostitute.. Im happy that my teacher was always there for me, and i was given a chance"<br><br>I don't regret the path in my life.. thou tedious and broke, it taught me the real value of money, and bring out the character that i have today.. I have miss out my precious child-hood, But i certainty did not miss out what i have achieved today..<br></div>
