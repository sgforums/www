              <p><br>they may have a better accent, according to ur standards.. but if they cant speak proper english and they cant convey their message across properly(which is generally true), there's no use in having a nicer accent.. so the content is primary, accent/handwriting is secondary, a privilege, i would say..</p>

              <p>First of all, I am a Chinese national.

              <p>Now back to Singapore English. I guess one reason Singaporeans have reacted so vehemently to those remarks is that there is some sense of insecurity with SG English.

              <p>First of all, I am a Chinese national. Having lived in Singapore for quite some time, I obviously find the views expressed in Kangxi Laile with respect to SG English to be rather preposterous. It is ignorance of this kind that really incites people's emotions. Therefore, think twice next time when one decides to lambaste China with remarks that are grounded in nothing but ignorance and bias. I know this is off the topic a bit. </p>
              <p>Now back to Singapore English. I guess one reason Singaporeans have reacted so vehemently to those remarks is that there is some sense of insecurity with SG English. Otherwise, imagine the same remarks are applied to Australian/British English, would you think the Aussies and Brits would get so worked up about it?  That said, there is no doubt that <span style="font-style: italic;">educated</span> Singaporeans have a superb command of the English language...  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>how would u know that they would not get worked up? or rather, if someone blaspheme your house would you stay quiet?</p>
