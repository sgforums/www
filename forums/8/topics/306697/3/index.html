              <p><br>I'm not sure about using their hearts bit</p>
              <p>That is highly debatable</p>
              <p>Anyway, I said that is going out of point of the whole topic because ultimately the main point is on the poor enunciation of Singaporeans, which is strange, coming from people who can hardly understand English in the first place.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, the PRC these days speak better English than the Taiwanese.</p>

              <p><br>I said they ran out of ideas because that brings back to the topic of accents and them making fun of our English.

              <p>Precisely! For a people who hardly speak English and can barely speak English, they must have run out of ideas or something to make fun of a country that uses English as their business language.</p>

              <p>so i said they probably werent script followers therefore running out of ideas doesnt apply (to something directly felt)<br>therefore proving u wrong in saying they ran out of ideas</p>
              <p>and when you say something heartfelt u dont need to be egoistic</p>

              i do not think the standard of english is low though. i mean this is a forum where everyone come in to chill. so there is nothing wrong in typing wrong words or even having short form. this is not writing compo or anything. actually most singaporeans can write and speak proper english. i just want to ask though. are you a singaporean urself then?

              it does not matter to me though. i mean it comes out from the mouths of people who do not even know how to speak proper english though. and what's more, many years back i saw a taiwan variety show that one of the challenges they posted was to speak english and many ppl on the streets have difficulty in speaking english though. so it's ok though. i'm not saying that we are better than them but they too have no right in saying us.
