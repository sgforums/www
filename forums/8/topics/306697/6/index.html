              Taiwan's english standard is lower than singapore but singapore's standard is lower than the English and Amercian. The taiwanese's chinese is really way better than us. I don't think it could be right for the ang mo to laugh at our english cos it will obviously spur fire and more oil.
              
              It is a good joke and perhaps a fact that they are making a woohaa with.

              <p><br>It is ok to criticize us.  Yes, we are not perfect, we have flaws.  We welcome comments, constructive comments.  But those celebrities, who themselves have problems speaking even a single fluent sentence of English, have the cheeks to criticise us!  Well, that is still fine i think.  Worse is, they twist their words around.</p>

              <p>Have you ever heard of Singaporeans say dance when they mean to say thanks?  i have not.</p>
              <p>Have you ever heard of Singaporeans say "one-taty, two-taty" when they meant to say 'one-thirty, two-thirty'? i have not.</p>

              <p>YOu can criticise us of our local slang.  No problem.  You can say that we use a lot of "lah" and "lor", no problem too.  But please, be honest.  Don't twist words around and put them into our mouths.  This, we will not tolerate.</p>

              <p><br>Whether he did that on purpose or not, you can tell from his expression, his smug look.  His pronounciation gets more and more exaggerated as his mis-pronounciation garnered more and more laughter!  You might not be able to tell, many can (including me).  It takes some degree of ability to observe to tell anyway!  wont expect that from you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I do not need you to apologise actually.  i just hope that people (including You) will be more responsible for their words.  Dont just yank for the sake of yanking!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A clue for you.  Pay attention to what the girl in red sitting in the centre.  She is the one who said one taty two taty.  If you still cant get it, i can tell you the exact second when that happened when i am back.  Ok, going to paint the town red!  Ciao.</p>
