              <p>Even if it is British or American criticising, don't think we should just accept. Only those that like to kow tao to the Ang Mo will just accept. Whose standard are we to accept, the british or american? This is Singapore and this style of english is part of our culture. Can't we make our own stand? They have no rights to criticise other's culture. What if the we say the taiwanese mandarin is crap and should follow Beijing's or Malaysian's or someone else? See if the Taiwanese angry or not. Every one forget the old chinese saying of "Enter other people's place, follow their doing."?</p>

              <p>but from what selina said in the show that they were being tested for the name of the months at their secondary school level... that pretty sums up their standard.</p>
              <p>another thing with the pegnant and dance thing. they sure they heard it correctly or was it because their engrish was so powderful that they heard pregnant as pegnant and thanks as dance?</p>
              <p>sometimes when you dont understand the other party doesnt means that they are lousy. it might be that you are the one that are lousy or you arent used to their accent. sometimes when i watch those drama from bbc, i cant catch what they were talking about. so according to those taiwanese, they doesnt know how to speak english?</p>
              <p>you guys should watch some of their variety shows where they got some engrish teachers up there to teach them engrish. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

It is part of the foundation in the idealogy that eventually leds to WWII. The Germans think they are the Aryan race, which is the superior race and the Japs also think they are the superior race and should rule over others... This fueled their thinking of the correctness to invade and kill other people. Seems a lot of people, including the people of victim countries of WWII have forgotten about this.</p></div>

              <p>No others have the capability to switch between Singlish and English as good as the singaporeans.</p>
              <p>The Taiwanese themselves don't even speak pure Chinese.. talk about the pot calling the kettle black.. Aiya embarrass themselves only.. Got balls then go speak on our sg tv show. Don't come here and act meek, then go home and talk c***..chey!</p>

              <p>also in this blog, he apologised to us already. But to me its like nothing, the apologise is like nothing! No meaning, he's just using the blog as a platform to apologise. I can do that too with a blog.</p>
              <p>I can't see sincere in his apologise. If he can suan us on television, i'm sure he should be able to apologise on television too. Till then, we will forgive him if not, suan liao, its just a non sincere apology using his blog.</p>

              <p>If comparing Taiwanese &amp; Singaporean's standard of English, there's really nothing to argue about. Everybody knows our Pri 6 kids can speak way better than majority of them.</p>
              <p>But generally, Singaporean's standard of English or Chinese isn't that high as compared to native speakers. I will think that is the problem of any nation which is bilingual or trilingual.</p>
