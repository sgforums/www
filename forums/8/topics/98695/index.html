            <div class='col-md body'>elementary, my dear watson. She didnt have shoes to wear, so she went to shoe shop, but since it is said that she didnt have anything on her, it means that she does not have the money to pay for the shoes.  SO the shopkeeper kept her there because she couldnt pay.</div>
