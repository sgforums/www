He lost $50.<br><br>That was how it started. But what he thought was a harmless flutter among friends turned out to be an uncontrollable addiction that was to last 17 years.<br><br>John (not his real name), a 31-year-old systems analyst, has lost close to $100,000 in soccer betting.<br><br>Four times, his parents bailed him out and more than once, they made him give up his credit cards.<br><br>But he ended up gambling again.<br><br>Finally, John's family forced him to go for counselling in March this year.<br><br>Counsellors say John is typical of problem gamblers here - a Chinese male in his 20s or 30s who has been gambling for more than 10 years.<br><br>When he was in school, he used to get a monthly allowance of $100.<br><br>He would bet on soccer games with friends at least once a week, $10 each time.<br><br>He kept his betting habits from his parents.<br><br>'I would eat less during recess and lunch time so I could save the money for betting,' he said.<br><br>'I would lose most of the time, but the occasional wins kept me going.'<br><br>When he started work as a part-time sales assistant at 17, the gambling got worse.<br><br>The stakes went up to $50.<br><br>At 21, he got his first credit card and discovered the world of credit lines and overdraft facilities.<br><br>And he started betting through illegal bookies, at least $100 per game every other day.<br><br>Said John, who was then earning less than $2,000 a month: 'I applied for at least 10 credit cards and applied for bank overdraft facilities on a few of them.<br><br>'I would pay the minimum and let the debts roll over. I kept thinking that I would be able to win big one day and recover all that I've lost.'<br><br>Within two years, he owed the credit card companies more than $20,000.<br><br>He could no longer hide his addiction from his family members when the credit card companies started calling.<br><br>His parents, who own a gift shop and earn about $4,000 a month, were livid.<br><br><strong>CANCELLED CREDIT CARDS</strong><br><br>Said John: 'They gave me an earful, but at the end, they forked out $20,000 of their savings to pay my debts.'<br><br>They also forced John to cancel his credit card subscriptions.<br><br>John did not want us to reveal his identity or talk to his family members, because it would be 'too embarrassing for them'.<br><br>Senior counsellor Charles Lee, from the Thye Hua Kwan Moral Problem Gambling Counselling Service, confirmed his story.<br><br>A few months after his parents cleared his debts, John returned to his old ways.<br><br>'It was hard to stay away. The temptation was just too much to resist,' he said.<br><br>'My friends introduced me to online betting and even when I was at work, I would be distracted and thinking of which matches to bet on.'<br><br>He applied for new credit cards, and began betting through illegal bookies, online and through Singapore Pools, putting down up to $2,000 each time.<br><br>When he was 27, he had accumulated another $30,000 in credit card debts.<br><br>John's parents again paid his debts, cancelled his credit card subscriptions and even denied him access to the computer at home so that he couldn't bet online.<br><br>But John still couldn't control his addiction and bet through bookies.<br><br>'I felt stressed and had trouble sleeping. I would be thinking of which games I wanted to bet on and whether I could win,' he said.<br><br>'At work, I couldn't concentrate and had the gambling website on my screen all the time.'<br><br>By the time he was 29, he was another $20,000 in debt.<br><br>His parents bailed him out yet again.<br><br>Then this year, just before Chinese New Year, John lost more than $20,000 in just two weeks.<br><br>It was the last straw.<br><br>His parents advised him to seek professional help at the Thye Hua Kwan Moral Problem Gambling Counselling Service.<br><br>Since March this year, he has been attending counselling twice a month, and has since learnt to set limits, as well as to rely on family support to curb his addiction.<br><br>Said John: 'I have not bet on a single game since March.<br><br>'There is something seductive about gambling that can draw you into a abyss.<br><br>'If you don't have the will power or self-control to stop, then don't start at all.'<br><br><strong>Centres to help gambling addicts</strong><br><br>AT the Care Corner Counselling Centre, 83 gamblers have been counselled since last October.<br><br>Said senior counsellor Jonathan Siew: 'People cannot extricate themselves from gambling because they hope to recoup their losses.<br><br>'They think there will eventually be a big win, that it will solve all their problems. Some even hope to use gambling as a means to prove themselves so that others will not look down on them.'<br><br>Care Corner is one of two centres providing lifelines to problem gamblers since early last year.<br><br>The Government set up the National Council on Problem Gambling in 2005 to tackle social problems linked to gambling.<br><br>This has become important ahead of the 2010 opening of the two mega integrated resorts here, which will include casinos.<br><br>At the Thye Hua Kwan Moral Problem Gambling Counselling Service, some 605 gambling-related calls were received between January last year and March this year.<br><br>Of these, 398 were followed up with counselling, said senior counsellor Charles Lee.<br><br>Genevieve Jiang<br><br><strong>HELPLINES:</strong><br><br>The National Council on Problem Gambling's website, www.ncpg.org.sg<br>The Thye Hua Kwan Moral Society's problem-gambling hotline 1800-X-GAMBLE or 1800-9426253.<br>Care Corner Counselling Centre problem-gambling hotline: 1800-6668668<br>IMH's Community Addictions Management Programme (Camp): 63892387/63892389<br><br>Copyright, 2007, Singapore Press Holdings Limited</div>
