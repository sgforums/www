            <div class='col-md body'><p>Accident policy. My friend got himself injured through a normal accident. Although my friend has submitted all the necessary documents like MC, hosipital bills, doctors verfications etc, the company keep dekaying payment by keeping asking for final hospital bills which my friend have already send in serveral times. When my friend contact the company, they will take a long time to reply and mind you, this is a big and reputable insurance company. The best thing is that my friend bought this policy in August 26 and he was injured in Mid-Sept. Throughout the whole month, he was going in and out of the hospital. In Oct, the company send him a email to inform him that his policy has been cancelled because he has not pay his Oct premiums as they were unable to do a giro deductation in his bank account. The problem is my friend has been spending most of his money for hospital bills and there were insufficent funds to deduct from his account. On the first week of Nov, my friend send in a cheque for the Oct + Nov + Dec premiums to the company and the company refused to accept it and inform him that his policy has already been cancelled and return him the cheque payment. The company claims that they are only able to pay compensation from 26Aug to 26 Sept as the coverage is only meant for that particular month. So my point is: why is the company delaying payment since all the documents have been given and why did the company outrightly cease the policy even when my friend send in his payment premiums? I hope I can help my friend because he was terminated by his company due to this accident and have not been working since 25 October. Can anyone advise how I should go about helping this friend of mine, Thanks</p></div>

              <p>Is this the first time his premium failed to deduct? I thought company normally offer grace period for premium deduction through GIRO the second time if the first payment cannot be sucessfully deduct?</p>
              <p>Depending on the insurance contract terms, you may wish to refer the matter to case?</p>

              <p>Don't help your friend out of kindness and naive, you will not see the light of friendship. Your friend will not appreciate your help but will think he deserves to be helped by you because you are trying to win his favors.</p>
              <p>Your friend will leave you to die for his personal gain and abandon you to die alone.</p>
              <p>You should not have carried away with your friendship, he's not going to stick with you forever and he will eventually betrays you over a girl or for a friend who can give him more benefits.</p>

              <p>Is it true?</p>
              <p>I am thinking of cancel my policy (life) and get the money back + interest. No point have life where I cannot feel or touch the money.</p>

              <p><br>I think that depends on what type of illness?</p>
              <p>If you die in an accident which is very obvious than the insurance company no choice have to compensate your family members.</p>
              <p>If you have some very obvious illness like cancer etc than they also no choice but to pay you..</p>
