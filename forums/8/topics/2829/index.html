            <div class='col-md body'>Laptops would be the in-thing in corporate sectors now. It seems most companies that deal in financial planning, insurance and other equity-related issues insist on their employees having a notebook.<br><br>Of course in most cases the notebooks are sponsered by the company but the drawback is u dun own it. However u can recommend to them wat is best in the current market and purchase it.<br><br>In terms of quality, i recommend the fujitsu P4 (model: c2110). It comes with the very latest in technology: firewire connection, optional bluetooth, large LCD screen and flatness incorporated. PS: might be a little heavy though since the cd-rom and disk drives are built in. But it's truly the best at the moment and it comes with a hefty price tag too. Then again if u work for a company, they're sponsering u right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>On the lower end, dell notebooks have gd svc support and would come highly recommended. Toshiba has always had a long standing quality appeal so if u dun mind their heavy notebooks, they're robust and reliable too.<br><br>IBM is at the moment on the downside, not many new models are coming out instead they're relying on their solid think-pads to maintain their sales. If u're patient, u can wait for a newer model to be released.<br><br>In the meantime, u can also consider other inexpensive brands like acer and compaq which aren't too bad either.<br><br>Or if u're moneybags, u can spoil urself with Mac's i-books.</div>

Personally I find them useful and actually got one for one of my projects last semester.</blockquote>actually i don't have anything against notebooks, so long as the genuine need for them is there. at the moment i have no need for a portable computer so i would choose a more powerful and cheap desktop, whose size doesn't affect me. if the need does arise, like if i need to do a lot of work on it on the go, then i would consider buying one. other than that i think its a waste of money, if i don't really bring it around that much.<br><br>a good point about laptops is if you use them a lot, they actually help you save a lot of power. desktop computers like mine use up a lot of power, and its not good because i leave my computer on a lot  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
