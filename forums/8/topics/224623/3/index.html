Hence, faith is, by its very nature, blind. I am guessing you used the word "blind" in front of "blind faith" just to add to your word count or to merely show off your vocab? God knows.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Mistake 2: Buildings in Singapore are built according to the strict standards set down by the Housing Development Board (HDB). These standards to ensure safety are internationally accepted and even more fiercely enforced by the Government after the unfortunate Nicole Highway incident in Singapore. Hence, believing a HDB flat will not collapse is not "blind faith". This is because the work put into the development of Sinagpore buildings are evident. Thus, faith should not be used to describe one's belief in the safety of HDB flats. Instead, the word "trust" should be used.</div>
