Thus, some people say that it is wrong. Is it wrong? OR are we humans too stupid and lack the intelligence to understand and give a explaination to it?</blockquote>The reason why it is "supernatural" is probbaly tat it is not verified and the only evidence of its existence is just hearsay. Human has no explanation for it not because they r "stupid" but rather there is no explanation for something tat doesn't exists or shown to exist.<br><br>If u say it is right, then there r probably a few hundred million things to believe in like tooth fairies, snow white, santa claus, or invisible pink unicorn and flying speghetti monster.

Because we simply lack thee intelligence to think God creating men as logical. Another way of saying it, if we have the intelligence, God creating men wouldnt be considered supernatural. </blockquote>So u r saying creationism doesn't make any sense and it belong to the supernatural ? And why will god make men to be "unnatural" yet create the "natural" world.<br><br><blockquote>On the other hand. If God is omnipotent, it is logical to say that he can create humans. The problem therefore, lies on omnipotency. It is the thing that is unfamiliar to humans, therefore, we group it together with creationsim, together with christianity, and say in general, that it is supernatural, while ther unfamiliar thing is only omnipotency(and others stuffs....) </blockquote>The assumption u made is an omnipotent god exists. If u say tat he is omnipotent, then create men unnaturally, then create a lot of phenomenons and evidence tat shows creationism is crap, and evolution is true, then still want people to believe creationism is true, then I can say tis god is really not omnipotent because he become a contradiction himself by either<br><br>1)failing to hide the facts of creationism well enough or<br>2)people fail to believe in him even when he try<br><br><blockquote>Lets say i really show you heaven, you can say it is all illusion.<br><br>If jesus really comes, you may say, aiya, he is just another magician...<br><br>Which is why i say there is no true evidence...in the end, evidence cant prove anything. part of the presuppositions in science is that none of what we see is illusion... </blockquote>Moses and the jews believe in him when he appears. Why do u think men will not believe in him when he appears ?<br><br><blockquote>What if all you see is illusion?</blockquote>Then christainity and all its followers is an illusion itself and still not worth believing</div>

Thus, some people say that it is wrong.</blockquote>The supernatural is hard to accept, because the limits of nature have not been fully explored. What used to be attributed to Gods (say lightning and Thor) now have a natural explanation. Science can investigate anything with a clear, testable hypothesis, that can extend into what people perceive as supernatural (for example the JAMA study on aura healing, and a recent study on the power of prayer on patients).<br><br>To believe in the supernatural immediately without asking hard questions first is intellectual laziness.<br><br><blockquote>Is it wrong?

Gravity for example, is known through human history. Science can give us specific measurements to help us understand its effects reliably, so that we can use this knowledge to build things.<br><br>There is absolutely no reason to believe in creationism, whether you are Christian or not, because creationism has no supporting evidence at all.
