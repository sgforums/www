            <div class='col-md body'>Thank you all for your replies. NaiveGirl is right- feelings are not to be controlled like a switch. You don't choose, you just fall in love.<br><br>I also agree that we should not give up without at least trying. I've tried for the past two months and I'm miserable. I missed him. Very very much.<br><br>But I'm not sure if he's the one for me. We've only had two weeks together before he left. We are also very very different. I didn't- and still don't- have much chance to find out if we will really have problems because we can only see each other maybe twice a year. (Emails and chat are not a good indication) I'm afraid that we would wait years only to find out that we cannot be happy together. (I've learnt from my failed relationships in the past that it takes a lot more than love for a relationship to work.) And I find myself missing him so much, I don't have much interest in anything or anyone else. This is not a good way to live.<br><br>The obstacles are extremely daunting. He can't come here and I can't go over. For at least four loooooong years! I tried to leave him once but failed. It hurt sooooo much, I don't want to be realistic, i don't want to think beyond today.<br><br>Basically, I'm stuck. I don't know what to do at all. Sigh.</div>
