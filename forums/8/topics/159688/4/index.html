            <div class='col-md body'>Anyone mentioned the lady in Yishun MRT already?<br><br>i am not in singapore anymore, so i am not sure if she's still there. Few yrs back when i was living in Yishun, there's a lady, quite old, always sit at the side of the Yishun MRT station, near the newspaper stand. She's always there during evening hours when ppl come back from work. She sit there and keep shouting, scolding his son in cantonese, saying something "it's so late already, why havent come back?" " Dinner cold already, still dont want to come back??" keep repeating something like that, everyday. My mom know something about her, she's mentally ill bcos of his husband left her, and her son is retarted also. that's why she so worried about him, always wait for him there and wants him to come home early.<br><br>Many yrs back in AMK central area, sometimes i see this old ah pek, who thinks he's kinda "chinese ghost buster". he put on a red cape on his back, with yellow color chinese charaters which i didnt get close enuff to read. he keep pointing at empty space and scold at it as if a ghost or something is there.</div>
