Xiaxue belongs to the type of people who shoots her mouth off without thinking or considering the damage of what she says.

Newspaper, reports and even column have some negative comments on her. Naturally, people would want to see how 'NEGATIVE' this blogger is. And if u notice, she did a moderation on her comments. Her blog have around 60k hits and u can't only expect less than 200 comments per post, sometimes even less than 100 comments. See, she only allows nice comments to be seen, which is why, she hides her 'negative' side. But a fox tail will also be revealed once revealed. Sad to say, we are reading her blog with a different perspective, not as a form of entertainment anymore. How i wish Dawn Yeo's blog will be back.</div>

I had read Xiaxue's blog in the past during the time that blogging was beginning to catch on. Even now, I do not have the habit of reading blogs and only chanced upon it in another forum where the thread title was "interesting links". I thought it might have been some joke site or funny clip.<br><br>Having already clicked on the link, I ended up reading the blog and I can say quite honestly that Xiaxue's colourful personality just poured into the blog. You can say I have my own opinion of what her character is like and since I don't know her in person, there's nothing much else to base on. To me, Xiaxue was (and still is) just an immature lady who shoots her mouth off without consideration.<br><br>She gives the impression that she is like those people I have met in person, who can bad mouth others to no end, and justify it by saying that they're just saying what's on their mind. So why are there those of us trying to be courteous in that case? I just can't understand these people who are seemingly from another planet.<br><br>It's not I hate Xiaxue personally or anything, but I can honestly say I dislike people like her. Only thing is that Xiaxue had become famous for it, to the point that she even managed to get a job with The New Paper. I happen to read The New Paper quite frequently and in a small editorial like that, you usually end up reading everything since it's not that much to read. And Xiaxue's articles only added to my dislike or her "type" of people.<br><br>Needless to say I think it was a good idea The New Paper gave her the boot but I didn't notice until they mentioned it in The Flame Awards. Quite obviously, she didn't seem to leave any friends behind at The New Paper.<br><br>I am not the kind that constantly follows Xiaxue's blog to find out who she is bad-mouthing this week. Because if her past record was anything to go by, her blog has nothing that I would look forward to reading.<br><br>I have my own opinion of her and people like her, and since there was such a thread, I decided to just post a related post.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SumOne:</div><div class="quote_body">As much as you have a valid point, I'm sorry to say it doesn't apply to me. I had read Xiaxue's blog in the past during the time that blogging was beginning to catch on. Even now, I do not have the habit of reading blogs and only chanced upon it in another forum where the thread title was "interesting links". I thought it might have been some joke site or funny clip.<br><br>Having already clicked on the link, I ended up reading the blog and I can say quite honestly that Xiaxue's colourful personality just poured into the blog. You can say I have my own opinion of what her character is like and since I don't know her in person, there's nothing much else to base on. To me, Xiaxue was (and still is) just an immature lady who shoots her mouth off without consideration.<br><br>She gives the impression that she is like those people I have met in person, who can bad mouth others to no end, and justify it by saying that they're just saying what's on their mind. So why are there those of us trying to be courteous in that case? I just can't understand these people who are seemingly from another planet.<br><br>It's not I hate Xiaxue personally or anything, but I can honestly say I dislike people like her. Only thing is that Xiaxue had become famous for it, to the point that she even managed to get a job with The New Paper. I happen to read The New Paper quite frequently and in a small editorial like that, you usually end up reading everything since it's not that much to read. And Xiaxue's articles only added to my dislike or her "type" of people.<br><br>Needless to say I think it was a good idea The New Paper gave her the boot but I didn't notice until they mentioned it in The Flame Awards. Quite obviously, she didn't seem to leave any friends behind at The New Paper.<br><br>I am not the kind that constantly follows Xiaxue's blog to find out who she is bad-mouthing this week. Because if her past record was anything to go by, her blog has nothing that I would look forward to reading.<br><br>I have my own opinion of her and people like her, and since there was such a thread, I decided to just post a related post.<br><br></div></blockquote>Wah..i totally agree with u. She's now famous for the wrong thing</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well...xiaxue used to be really funny until she was publicised widely around singapore and then she seems to write for an audience and then it isn't so nice anymore. it's because of ppl like the above who keeps critisizing her. imagine having to read so many bad comments about you. i think ppl who critisize her are just as bad if you think xiaxue is bad. she is a human being too....and a girl some more! i really dun understand why if ppl dislike her, they still go to her blog and read and read and read and then get angry and say she sucks. this kind of ppl really no life. go and make ownself angry for no reason.<br><br>boy.....don't you just hate stupid ppl?<br><br>HAIZ!<br>i suggest ppl who are anti-xiaxue to read her very old archives like in 04 or 03 to get to know why she was so popular back then. her entries really will make one burst out laughing. so lianish! hahah.</div>

But to add on, Xiaxue may be a girl, but she's no lady. You don't expect to be polite about someone who uses profanity without a hoot on her webpage.<br><br>And she shoots her mouth off about people as well, and not just on her blog, during her time at TNP as well. So she's definitely no angel, so why are you defending her?<br><br>As far as I see it, she deserves the flak she's getting. And please be reasonable, she places her blog on the World Wide Web where everyone can access. You can't expect everyone to like the kind of things she says.<br><br>Besides, she's a public person by now (kind of). I don't see you defending others like Sun Ho or whichever public person that is getting flak. Sun Ho is a human being and a female too you know.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong>boy.....don't you just hate stupid ppl?</strong>[/quote]<br><br>No wonder you hate yourself.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>If you are to reply to others, at least read through the posts before shooting your mouth off.

Happy to say again, i'm all for what u say, sumone. I find that what u said is totally true.<br><br>Why does people keep assuming that we actually goes to her blog, get angry and say she sucks. People don't need to go to her blog to realise what kind of 'girl' she is. Applesweet may claim that she's a girl afterall. But that doesn't give XiaXue, whom Applesweet claims to be a 'girl'(as if she's come gentle, elegant lady) the right to go around making assumptions. I suppose Applesweet didn't read the previous post and just jump to conclusions. Please, seriously Applesweet, don't become another XiaXue and pollute this thread, making assumptions.<br><br>Applesweet, now i know why u are standing by Xiaxue, for thefact that u called people stupid, isn't it behaving just like her. haiz..<br><br></div>

IT just so happen that she's being discovered as the hottest blogger, so why the heck would people care about her blog content now. Furthermore, she don't blogs for quite some time, that gives people the chance to create unnecessary asummptions about her - saying her doing plastic surgery etc..crap!</div>
