Those racism bloggers who are sued are talking rubbish and I think they deserved it. But if you blog facts along with evidence (Not many people do both), I rather the mentioned party do something about it or investigate the matter instead of suing the blogger immediately. I'm just glad my school haven't implemented that rule yet. Most negative posts from students about their school/teachers are rantings and childish remarks, why do we have to care so much? It not as though we don't criticize a teacher behind his/her back in school too. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </span><br><br>Blog is for people who are sensible enough to pour out their thoughts, share with people and accept views from people..<br><br><span style="color: red;">Not only that. Most of us teenagers simply use it as a portal to share our everyday experiences with our friends. So theres basically different types of blogs for different types of people. And lets not forget those wishy washy people who pour out other people's thoughts instead of their own and wants to blend into the crowd. I hate those kind of people. Which is why I enjoy Xiaxue's posts. She stands by her views strongly. And from what I've seen, the views given to her by her readers are not exactly useful to her at all...</span><br><br>Above mentioned, XiaXue fails every part. I visit it because i want to see how b*tchy she is for at least i know, someone's popular out there is becoming more popular becos she's a b*tch</div></blockquote> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
