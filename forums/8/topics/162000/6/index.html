Happy to say again, i'm all for what u say, sumone. I find that what u said is totally true.<br><br>Why does people keep assuming that we actually goes to her blog, get angry and say she sucks. People don't need to go to her blog to realise what kind of 'girl' she is. Applesweet may claim that she's a girl afterall. But that doesn't give XiaXue, whom Applesweet claims to be a 'girl'(as if she's come gentle, elegant lady) the right to go around making assumptions. I suppose Applesweet didn't read the previous post and just jump to conclusions. Please, seriously Applesweet, don't become another XiaXue and pollute this thread, making assumptions.<br><br>Applesweet, now i know why u are standing by Xiaxue, for thefact that u called people stupid, isn't it behaving just like her. haiz..<br><br></div></blockquote>on the topic of assumptions, why are you assuming my nick means that i'm sweet? arrggghhh. my nick actually means that i'm a girl who likes to eat sweet apples. i hope it clears everyone's doubts once and for all!<br>well. you have to know me in person to judge me ba. yeaps. ^^</div>

You have obviously misunderstood.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong>i do not like nor dislike her. must i repeat myself?</strong></div></blockquote>And I don't constantly read her blog to get myself work up, think I've repeated that quite a few times too.<br><div class="quote_body"><blockquote>I JUST DON'T LIKE STUPID PPL WHO GOES TO OTHER PPL'S BLOGS WHOM THEY DON'T LIKE AND MAKE THEMSELVES FOAM IN THE MOUTH FOR NO GOOD REASON.</blockquote></div>Just to be clear, thank goodness you're not talking about me.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong>when i say xiaxue is a girl, i'm not speaking up for her. i'm speaking up for all girls. vulgar or not, a girl is still a girl. we are still the more emotional and sensitive sex. even though in your eyes, she doesn't seem to be those kinds of girls who would cry when ppl scold her mean things, i believe she DO get affected and will feel hurt or sad. </strong></div></blockquote>I think this is misplaced feminism at work here. What's with the gender discrimination? Guys too will get affected and will feel hurt or sad when mean things are said to them. And who says that the definition of a girl is someone who cries when she's scolded?<br><br>Personally, I think you've insulted all ladies by saying something like that. I would appreciate it better if you spoke up for a lady or ladies more respectable than that. But then again, that's my opnion of course.<br><br>Xiaxue gets those comments about her not because she's a girl and quite frankly this gender issue is rather off topic. I'd prefer not to go on about this and not with you at least.<br><div class="quote_body"><blockquote>so yes, i'm giving you what you advice others: THINK BEFORE YOU SPEAK. as in, if you don't like her, you don't have to go to her blog and say mean things. just don't read anymore. </blockquote></div>Read my previous posts.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong>now, i'm not saying that you are one of those stupid and mean ppl who say mean things to her, so don't get all fired up if you are not such ppl.</strong></div></blockquote>I'm quite calm about this actually, and I'm not the one using caps. Then again, you've using it as if it were me. Seems you're getting me wrong on a lot of things. I guess we all make mistakes sometimes.<br><div class="quote_body"><blockquote>anyways, you might then say, "HA! THINK BEFORE YOU SPEAK, RIGHT? THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M TRYING TO CONVEY TO XIAXUE!"</blockquote></div>Who said anything about conveying it to her? Not like I'll know if she'll come into sgforums and read my post or not. If I wanted to convey anything to her,  I definitely will not be trying to do that by posting here. I just came into a thread that was about Xiaxue and Dawn Yeo so I just gave comments about both.<br><br>Besides, I doubt Xiaxue would care even if I told her straight to her face.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong>but see. it's her blog. though it's put on the world wide web, ppl can choose to go read or not read it. but can she stop ppl from coming to receive what she has written?</strong></div></blockquote>Whether there are many people reading the blog or not, being responsible for what is said or posted is a different thing.<br><div class="quote_body"><blockquote>what you have written is so irrelevant! </blockquote></div>That again is your opinion. I do feel that the gender issue is even more irrelavant though.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong>you say you have read her 03, 04 archives before...but i don't really think so...</strong></div></blockquote>My reading the same thing doesn't mean I have to respond in the same way. Maybe you might think it's a guy-girl thing but I doubt so.<br><div class="quote_body"><blockquote>well doesn't matter. none of my business anyway. i can't be bothered with you also.</blockquote></div>I'm just replying you post by post as I always do. And I understand that each individual will have their own response to anything that is said or posted by another person. So I'll just see what response you give or don't give.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong>wells. i really do miss the xiaxue who wasn't a public figure then. i'm sure old readers of xiaxue's blog will agree!</strong></div></blockquote>That basically is an assumption but anyway, not everyone would have the same opinion. If we all did then humans are just a bunch of robots.<br><div class="quote_body">[quote]i started reading her blog when i was in secondary school! that was really long ago! &gt;"&lt;</div>Well I hope you can find some who can entertain you just as much, so many bloggers out there anyway.<br></div>

In the past, she can blog freely as she wish, cos back then, she's nothing..not even peanuts. Now, she has gained fame for the wrong reasons, perhaps right to you, she should be more sensible in writing and know what's logical. The way she's putting it is seriously illogical.

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm...but blogging about positive things all day is really boring to read, i think... you can find positive writing in self-help books.<br>aiya. anyways, xiaxue's writing style has changed as time passed. now her blog is almost ads, ads, ads and it's not really funny anymore. used to be really addicted to her blog in the past. but now she spends a lot of time defending herself and writing about ppl who dislike her...it's really boring.<br>however, i feel that there is a reason why her writing style changed. it's because of her sudden shoot to fame and the increase in more ppl knowing her blog and reading it. narrow-minded ppl are aplenty in singapore and they get offended by the tiniest of matters, and so she found that many ppl hate her views and everything, explaining why she tries to sound smart in her blog now, talking about important issues in perfect english. it's really a bore!<br>also, she used to share many things about her private life, but i think now she keeps many stuffs to herself. and only writes about parties and stuffs. really boring!!! haiz!<br>really miss her old stuffs where what she writes can be a discussion topic among friends.</div>
