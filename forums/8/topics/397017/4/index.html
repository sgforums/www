              <p>Obviously not.</p>
              <p>All I see is that you are still confused. A mere 72 pages of a personal finance book I shared with you, and you tell me it's too many pages. Talk about basic money management principles, and you missed out one of the greatest read on it. That's still ok, but then you complained about the 72 pages. You got some of the theories, but do note that mere knowing and talking big about theories does nothing for you.</p>
              <p>Anyway, as I said, you happy can liao. I'm not here to convince you or anything; it's just a normal chit chat forum. Just do whatever you are happy with. Your life and goals anyway. I'm back to my stuff.</p>

              <p>@ TS: Starting a business is really not easy. Hard work is a must, yes. But it's not enough. You need the concept, the strategy, target audience, budget, money, goal, analyze market, luck and many more. You need to have the "eye" to see where you can prosper in the market. network is another thing all together.</p>
              <p>classic question: How is your product better than the rest such that people will chose your product?</p>
              <p>Starting a business yourself actually let you step further into the rat race. Fiercer somemore. A simple way of explaining.</p>
              <p>Business is either gaining or losing money. and you HAVE to gain, there is no other route. and so you are entering rat race again with other business fighting for the pie and you will NOT be satisifed with gaining enough as you must bear the idea of losing your money anytime. well, unless you know where to stop the greed and sell your profiting business.</p>
              <p>A normal employee can chose to QUIT in the rat race by being satisifed with what one has.</p>

              <p>@ TS: Starting a business is really not easy. Hard work is a
              must, yes. But it's not enough. You need the concept, the strategy,
              target audience, budget, money, goal, analyze market, luck and
              many more. You need to have the "eye" to see where you can prosper
              in the market. network is another thing all together.</p>
              <p>classic question: How is your product better than the rest such
              that people will chose your product?</p>
              <p>Starting a business yourself actually let you step further into
              the rat race. Fiercer somemore. A simple way of explaining.</p>
              <p>Business is either gaining or losing money. and you HAVE to
              gain, there is no other route. and so you are entering rat race
              again with other business fighting for the pie and you will
              NOT be satisifed with gaining enough as you must bear the idea of
              losing your money anytime. well, unless you know where to stop the
              greed and sell your profiting business.</p>
              <p>A normal employee can chose to QUIT in the rat race by being
              satisifed with what one has.</p>

              <p>well said..</p>
              <p>With regards to business further into the rat race..from my perspective..it beg to differ..</p>
              <p>a tradditional biz is a rat race..as long as an individual is still working hard for money (chasing money) than i agree that the person is in the rat race..but not when the person fire himself/herself.</p>
              <p>a business with a proven system (eg: Macdonalds Franchise Owner) does not need to work, investors pay for the system to earn money, and not because of the food they sell, which even Macdonlads they themselve acknowledge that fact.</p>
              <p>thus business with a system that automatically generates money without the owner physical involvement is the process of getting out of rat rat by not running in the race anymore..</p>

              <p>I think it's about mindset rather the actual fact that we are all rats..</p>
              <p>it's a fact that majority of us are in the rat race like it or not..but not for those born in with the silver spoons who can just take over their family businesses..</p>
              <p>than as for defending my view..maybe it is my habit to ensure that i keep track of what's happening in the thread i started..</p>
              <p>as for the rat issue..different people have different views, we can change the situation we are in..I based my ideas on Robert's CashFlow Quadrant of the Employee, Self-Employed, Business Owner and Investor setting..</p>
              <p>Plus the other thing is try connecting all 9 dots (in a square shapre with 1 dot in the center of the square; like the tic-tac-toe game just without all the lines, replace the slots meant for the O &amp; X with 9 dots) with only 4 lines.</p>
              <p>This game is about thinking Out of the Box..once you can connect all the 9 dots together with 4 continuous line than you'll get what I mean..</p>

              <p>i think it is more to being brain-washed by the education system..which goes by this: "Study Hard, Work Hard, Get a Good Job, Work Long and get higher Pay for a good life"</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">First and second quote both tells me</span> <strong>not to be the frog in the well thinking that the sky is only as big as the shape of the well.</strong></p>
              <p>But I don't really understand the third quote; can you explain it?</p>
              <p>I think there's another quote which can be associated to both rat race and entrepreneurship..</p>

              <p>Well, with regards to that..I've already worked for few years
              already before I enlisted..and I'm super sick to go back to the rat
              race after I ORDed.. having to get only a slice of the cheese for a
              month of hard work..fighting over the same miserable cheese with
              collegues to remain in that maze..</p>
              <p>i think it is more to being brain-washed by the education
              system..which goes by this: "Study Hard, Work Hard, Get a Good Job,
              Work Long and get higher Pay for a good life"</p>
              <p>the new model i adopt is to become a farmer..planting a tree and
              getting multiple food in return..getting multiple rewards with one
              single effort made..that's what the rich are best at..and that's
              the difference between rags to riches..</p>
              <p>the perspective that I hold is to be our own boss and control
              our own sources of income rather than letting others control it for
              us..</p>

              <p>Hehe, it doesn't make you look smart at all when you merely quote from Robert Kiyosaki.</p>
              <p>There are so many students in Singapore who read the same book, then tell their school teachers that there's no need for them to study because they just need to start a business and employ pple who studied hard and scored very well.</p>
              <p>So many pple are saying the same thing, hehe. What makes you think you are different from the others?</p>

              <p>There's this fren who once told me the same thing, and was very enthusiastic about it. Her grades weren't good, and she did not have a uni degree. However, she was very sure she knew a lot about getting out of the rat's race, not by life's experience, but merely by reading books, hehe. Talked a lot about employing smart pple to work for her. Went on for some time.</p>
