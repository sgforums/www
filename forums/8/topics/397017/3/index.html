              <p>the way i view it in my definition as a boss is same to the
              cashflow quadrant whereby it is a Business Owner with people
              working for you.</p>
              <p>So by firing yourself, you no longer work, and have people
              working for you. You aren't in the rat race, able to free yourself
              to invest and hire more people to work for you and grow your money
              keeping the net profit after paying all expenses and liability.</p>
              <p>Rat race is when you are doing the same thing for the same
              result repeatingly but if a person is doing the same thing for
              multiple results and benefits, is that person in a rat race? (the
              super rich, isn't in a rat race; that's how i see it)</p>
              <p>as for financial freedom; i think you're referring to only the
              passive income and not specifically financial freedom; it is the
              ability to free yourself completely from work without worries, and
              have money generating on automated process even as you eat, sleep
              or travel. That is true financial freedom where you can still spend
              without worrying for your budget in my humble opinion la.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>When you are in the B quadrant, you are still there for the same result: money. As far as I'm concerned, you will still be in the rat's race. It's a farce that you no longer need to work by having people work for you. Keep up this mindset and I assure you that you will fail sooner or later.</p>
              <p>To get out, (but still a rat), you will need to have passive income. Financial freedom is still a mindset, and passive income is only a portion of it. Spending without worrying about budget is classified under financial abundance, not financial freedom. It's a stage where you can spend to attain your dream lifestyle forever. Financial freedom is only a stage where you can continue your <span style="text-decoration: underline;">current lifestyle</span> with your passive income sources.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The above is what I have read and understood and thought about after a year plus in the work force. You may or may not agree with it, but it's working moderately well for me at the moment, and I'll be taking myself on the next step of my journey in a year or two time... Meanwhile, I'm preparing and building my capital base.</p>

              <p>i agree partially with what you have said..</p>
              <p>perhaps it's just that the difference in each individual perspective and views.</p>
              <p>you're right about the financial abundance..</p>
              <p>perhaps i'm think too much..as my definition of financial freedom to you is financial abundance, but to me..it's only freedom as it only allows me to do what i want among my own envirionment and situation etc..</p>
              <p>what i understand of financial abundance is the ability and financial capabliity to do charity, donations to people we do not know of..by throwing above money for a good purpose without expecting any returns in mind is what i define as financial abundance whereby only large MNCs companies and super rich individuals can do that.</p>

              <p>You can continue in your belief that you don't need to work hard, but can take short cuts to become a business owner just like that. Just like I mention in another thread, your life, your choice. Doesn't bother me.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  You can always come out of the rat race and lead a life you desire, if you wish to consider a path that is less taken. Think very carefully what that path may be and stay open to opportunities that may lead you to the path. Be with positive people often, to counter negativity. Happiness is a state of mind, so you can become happy now, without any conditions. You just want to be happy, rather than you need this or that to be happy.</p>

"Thy grandfather enjoyed working. The Gods appreciated his efforts and rewarded him liberally." <br><br>"I begin to see," Hadan Gula was speaking thoughtfully. "Work attracted his many friends who admired his industry and the success it brought. Work brought him the honors he enjoyed so much in Damascus. Work brought him all those things I have approved. And I thought work was fit only for slaves."<br><br>"Life is rich with many pleasures for men to enjoy," Sharru Nada commented. "Each has its place. I am glad that work is not reserved for slaves. Were that the case I would be deprived of my greatest pleasure. Many things do I enjoy but nothing takes the place of work." <br><br>Sharru Nada and Hadan Gula rode in the shadows of the towering walls up to the massive, bronze gates of Babylon. At their approach the gate guards jumped to attention and respectfully saluted an honored citizen. With head held high Sharru Nada led the long caravan through the gates and up the streets of the city. <br><br>"I have always hoped to be a man like my grandfather," Hadan Gula confided to him. "Never before did I realize just what kind of man he was. This thou hast shown me. Now that I understand, I do admire him all the more and feel more determined to be like him. I fear I can never repay thee for giving me the true key to his success. From this day forth, I shall use his key. I shall start humbly as he started, which befits my true station far better than jewels and fine robes."</p>

              <p>Making money is simple.</p>
              <p>You don't need to understand advance formula to be rich, simple plus minus divide and multiplication and basic accounting knowledge will do.</p>
              <p>Are all business owners (enterpreneurs) holding PHDs or are they hiring the people to work for them?</p>
              <p>77th Street Entrepreneur is a ITE graduate and she has done ITE proud without degrees or even diplomas.</p>
              <p>You than is confused with all those unncessary fomulas and knowledge.</p>
              <p>To be rich, we just need to understand the basic money management principles on how to maximize our profits and nothing more.</p>
              <p>Real hands on experiences beats academic studies in some ways for businesses.</p>
