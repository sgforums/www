              <p>the way i view it in my definition as a boss is same to the cashflow quadrant whereby it is a Business Owner with people working for you.</p>
              <p>So by firing yourself, you no longer work, and have people working for you. You aren't in the rat race, able to free yourself to invest and hire more people to work for you and grow your money keeping the net profit after paying all expenses and liability.</p>
              <p>Rat race is when you are doing the same thing for the same result repeatingly but if a person is doing the same thing for multiple results and benefits, is that person in a rat race? (the super rich, isn't in a rat race; that's how i see it)</p>
              <p>as for financial freedom; i think you're referring to only the passive income and not specifically financial freedom; it is the ability to free yourself completely from work without worries, and have money generating on automated process even as you eat, sleep or travel. That is true financial freedom where you can still spend without worrying for your budget in my humble opinion la.</p>
