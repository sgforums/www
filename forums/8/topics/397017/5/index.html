              <p>There are so many students in Singapore who read the same book,
              then tell their school teachers that there's no need for them to
              study because they just need to start a business and employ pple
              who studied hard and scored very well.</p>
              <p>So many pple are saying the same thing, hehe. <span style="color: #ff6600;">What makes you

              <p>You are really sensitive I guess. I merely stated my opinions and perspectives, because I don't totally subscribe to those books that you have 
                  quoted and read. And it's because I firmly believed your thoughts are too idealistic for you, and sharing with you a more pragmatic and down-to-earth approach.</p>

              <p>I'm already doing what I like. Like I'm going to bother much about you if you don't want to accept any pragmatic ideas. </p>
              <p>I shall repeat Mr Wee's quote</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>If you see in any given situation only what everybody
                                          else can see, you can be said to be so much a 
                  representative of
                                          your culture that you are a victim of it.</p>
              <p>-- Quote by S. I. Hayakawa.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>By being too engrossed about the rat's race, you are still a rat in the race. That's the whole point that me and Bear and Mr Wee were trying to put across to you via different forms. Only thing is, you think we are attacking you because of that!</p>

              650. But if my expenditure is $2000 a month, then I haven't reach

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  You can always come out of the rat race and lead a life
              you desire, if you wish to consider a path that is less taken.
              Think very carefully what that path may be and stay open to
              opportunities that may lead you to the path. Be with positive
              people often, to counter negativity. Happiness is a state of mind,
              so you can become happy now, without any conditions. You just want
              to be happy, rather than you need this or that to be
              happy.</p>
              <p>  Thanks.</p>

              <p>You have said your piece, and I've said mine..</p>
              <p>Our views clearly is on completely different frequency..much the less about understanding..</p>
              <p>Who's right, who's wrong, is not for us to say/decide for ourselves..but for other fellow users to judge and they themselves will have the answer..</p>
              <p>with regards to my english..do note that this is a forum, not a examination, i don't really need to type in perfect english etc..i just need to type/write in a forum standard which the forum understands..</p>
              <p>if you think this is bad..ask the long regular forum users of sgforums..back in the early days of this forum..the english is much worse..simply put it..there's no english..only +1, NPNT, picture with texts inside etc..in case you don't know the chances of this forum..considering your period of stay in this forum.</p>
              <p>if you want to twist your words here and there, by all means, please go ahead..i'm not going to play with you..since it is my practise to only clarify and offer quality replies and postings as compared to gossips and useless posts which most users are contributing..</p>
              <p>Having said my point, that's it.</p>
              <p>PS: You remind me of somebody..in another previously popular sgforum "forum" in the past..</p>
