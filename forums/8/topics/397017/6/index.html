              <p>Our views clearly is on completely different frequency..much the less about understanding..</p>
              <p>Who's right, who's wrong, is not for us to say/decide for ourselves..but for other fellow users to judge and they themselves will have the answer..</p>
              <p>with regards to my english..do note that this is a forum, not a examination, i don't really need to type in perfect english etc..i just need to type/write in a forum standard which the forum understands..</p>
              <p>if you think this is bad..ask the long regular forum users of sgforums..back in the early days of this forum..the english is much worse..simply put it..there's no english..only +1, NPNT, picture with texts inside etc..in case you don't know the chances of this forum..considering your period of stay in this forum.</p>
              <p>if you want to twist your words here and there, by all means, please go ahead..i'm not going to play with you..since it is my practise to only clarify and offer quality replies and postings as compared to gossips and useless posts which most users are contributing..</p>
              <p>Having said my point, that's it.</p>

              <p>3) Immediately assume that you are different from the others because you are not in the rat's race.</p>
              <p>4) Assume that most other users are contributing useless posts and gossips. Look at wee_ws and eagle and the rest of the homework forum moderators. They are contributing so much to Homework Forum. What have you? Zilch except a load of bull.</p>

              <p>One really wonders, since it is your practise to only clarify and offer quality replies and postings, why is it that your postings mostly stinks of giving excuses, labelling differing opinions as flames, poor usage of grammar (quality?) and heavy self-centredness?

              <p>Yup, we shall let other forumers judge. Do bear in mind your posts of generalisation above has basically attacked most forumers. Every extra post you made merely dig a deeper grave for yourself.</p>

              <p>This is always the phrase that is used when people have no hard facts to substantiate themselves. Many forumers had done that in Speaker's Corner. I don't participate in those threads, and read only passively. Usually, my judgment of them isn't good at all. You can be assured that others will think the same of you.</p>
