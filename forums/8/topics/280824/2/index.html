For example, their history syllabus will have no mention of one of their most important prime ministers even; winston churchill. Many old-timers strongly opposed this as it would bring shame to the British...haha...not sure of the outcome though. this was reported in the straits times...</div>

The whole scene had an eerie, surreal quality, like when you're on vacation in another city and "Jeopardy" comes on at 7pm instead of 7:30.<br><br>Her hair glistened in the rain like nose hair after a sneeze.<br><br>Her eyes were like two brown circles with big black dots in the center.<br><br>Bob was as perplexed as a hacker who means to access T:\flw.quid55328.com\aaakk/ch@ung but gets T:\flw.quidaaak/ch@ng by mistake.<br><br>He was as tall as a six-foot three-inch tree.<br><br>The hailstones leaped from the pavement, just like maggots when you fry them in hot grease.<br><br>Her date was pleasant enough, but she knew that if her life was a movie this guy would be burried in the credits as something like "Second Tall Man."<br><br>Long separated by cruel fate, the star-crossed lovers raced across the grassy field toward each other like two freight trains, one having left Cleveland at 6:36pm traveling at 55 mph, the other from Topeka at 4:19pm at a speed of 35 mph.<br><br>The politician was gone but unnoticed, like the period after the Dr. on a Dr. Pepper can.<br><br>John and Mary had never met. They were like two hummingbirds who had also never met.<br><br>The thunder was ominous-sounding, much like the sound of a thin sheet of metal being shaken backstage during the storm scene in a play.<br><br>His thoughts tumbled in his head, making and breaking alliances like underpants in a drier without "Cling-Free."<br><br>The red brick wall was the color of a brick-red crayola crayon.</div>
