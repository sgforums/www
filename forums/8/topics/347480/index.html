            <div class='col-md body'><p>Scientology has established itself in the United States of America as one of the new mainstream religions. It is rapidly growing at an estimated rate of three churches a day. Scientology is dangerous. It not only has the potential to expand itself into a global charlatan organization, its methods and beliefs have a huge potential threat to the safety of mankind.<br><br>One of such believes is Scientology believes psychiatry is "destructive, abusive and must be abolished" [1]. Instead Scientology advocates its own form of warped psychiatry that they believe can heal nearly any sickness. However, their treatment has led to many mysterious deaths that the Church of Scientology, as it calls itself, has covered up. This include the death of actor John Travolta's son, Jett Travolta. Until today, mystery shrouds the case and true cause of his death. Another case Lisa Mcpherson too was killed by the Church through its unlicensed and illegitamate means of healing. On this account, the Church was indicted with two felony charges, including abuse or neglect of a disable adult and practicing medicine without a license.<br><br>The list goes on and on. Take a look at how many more Scientology related deaths are there.<br>http://www.whyaretheydead.net/<br><br>As you can see for yourself. Scientology does not heal as it proclaims to be able to, it kills.<br><strong><br></strong>If you think allowing Scientology to expand as long as it doesn't infringe on your personal space should be advocated. Think again. Scientology is far more aggressive than you think it is. You will soon find leaflets of jewellery discounts with Scientological advertisements on them, is it because the jewellery stores or coorperations have an agreement with the Church? No, it is because the Church of Scientology is a scourge that forces its way through to whatever it takes to forcibly convert and brainwash people.<br><br>Scientology is not a peaceful cult, it has established that it is not a "turn the other cheek" religion [2]. That means, YOU cannot publicly criticise scientology before being sued by the church for fabricated crimes, it means YOU cannot voice your decent before being harrassed by Scientology day and night. It means YOU have to watch while your son/daughter/husband/wife is converted before your own eyes to a heathen belief and there is nothing you can do about it, if you attempt to discipline/reason with her/him, the full wrath will befall you, infidel. <br><br>Your secret affair with the waitress in China will be made public, that time you took a smoke of pot, Scientology knows it too, and they will make it public.<br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><br>If you don't give a damn about society at large,willing to allow the general populace to believe in the works of a very enterprising Sci-fi writer, L. Ron Hubbard, anonymous doesn't either! However, fellow tax-payers, this might interest you more.</strong></span><br><br>Scientology is a United States recognized religion. It enjoys tax reliefs and pension bonuses to the staff of the Church. This pension amounts and tax-reliefs have already mounted up to hundreds of millions in the United States. <br><br>This means that if Scientology gets here, it will use YOUR money to organize its ridiculous drives for recruitment. It means YOUR money will be wasted on allowing a money wasting cult that aggressively recruits more members to scam and force donations. <br><br>In fact, the Church of Scientology does not reveal its core teachings to members until they have donated thousands of dollars. It has also sued people for quoting short paragraphs of information from its so-called "religious texts" . ((Similar religious texts can also be found in Borders, MPH  and kini under the Science fiction sections if you are interested in Scientology)).  Do not let your fellow dumb and friendly countrymen get scammed. <br>Do not let Scientology spread its tentacles into our Island nation. <br><br>____________________________________________________________________<br>Facts about Scientology<br><br>1. Officially reconized as a commercial enterprise in Germany , not a religion.<br>2. Not reconized in Austria and Canada.<br>3. Ruthlessly attacks its critics by sending P.Is to dig up on the private life of its critics and airing them to the public. (Blackmail? Close)<br>4. Has its religion based on the beliefs of <strong>SCIENCE FICTION WRITER</strong> and now long dead, L Ron Hubbard.<br>5.Scientology has been very tight lipped about its finances, as do all organizations that are unable to account for millions of mishandled donations.<br>6. Has a tendancy to drive teenage believers to suicide.<br>7.Practices Disconnection, in which members of the Church are ordered to break ties with ANYONE they know who disagrees with the Church.<br><br>The list goes on, Scientology must be destroyed . It is a greed driven cult that is spreading misinformation throughout the world, through the internet, Anonymous has designated Scientology for destruction. Anonymous is winning. <br><br>I will get epic lulz if L Ron hubbard tries to contact me from venus or pluto after I finish this.<br><br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCbKv9yiLiQ<br><br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB8ZrM3Adxk<br><br>Facts about anonymous<br>Anonymous does not attack the Church of Scientology because of their beliefs, we attack the Church of Scientology because it has runied and taken the lifes of many . We attack the church of Scientology because of its perversions of the copyright laws, and putting a price that is ridiculous on information. We attack this church because information should be free. We attack this church because Scientology has abused its members and misapropriated millions of dollars. Scientology has too long been allowed to commit crimes without being checked.  Anonymous will not allow it. We will wield the hammer of justice and bring it down upon Scientology. Only until Scientology is destroyed, we will not stop. <br><br><br><br>======================================================================<br>We are Anonymous<br>We do not forgive<br>We do not forget<br>We are legion<br>Expect us<br>Until you have lost the game<br><br><br>[2] Quoted from Times<br>[1]Quoted from wikipedia</p></div>

              <p>Scientology is crap; a kind of freak religion dreamt up by mad author L Ron Hubbard.</p>
              <p>only fools like Tom Cruise will become a follower. it's the US-version of Falungong.</p>
              <p>it is a new-age heretic cult, and combines the beliefs of existing major religions.</p>
              <p>anyway, i think it's time i create my own religion too and recruit followers.</p>
              <p>my religion will be Nikarism, and we believe in peace, joy and sex.</p>
              <p>all newcomers will be baptised by having sex with 150 hot woman in the Hall of Nikar.</p>
              <p>no fees needed, only donations.</p>
              <p>IN THE NAME OF MY LORD!!!! I WILL CRUSH ANY SCIENTOLOGIST!!!!!!!!!</p>

              <p>Read the topmost post again.<br><br>For starters, Scientology abuses its own members by placing a high amount of pressure on them through practices such as Disconnection which essentially forces them to sever ties with anyone they know that has denounced Scientology.<br><br>Scientology also shuns modern medicine and has used its own form of medical treatments that has killed several members of its church. If you practice Scientology without any approval of the Church, it is considered a copyright infringement and thus can be sued for violation of copyright and trademark law. What sort of faith requires you to be a full fledged member of it's church in order to practice it and why such a requirement?<br><br>A simple inference would tell you the obvious. The church is abusing the position it has to defraud its members, it would obviously want more members officially so as to be able to collect more "donations". <br><br>The Church also has its infamous "fair game policy" in which people who have been declared "enemies" of the church, can be "deprived of property, or injured by any means. May be sued,lied to , tricked or destroyed." Quoted from from HCOPL Oct. 18, 1967 Issue IV, <em>Penalties for Lower Conditions. </em>This is no worse than the Islamic extremist groups that are considered terrorist globally. <br><br>Why complain about the money the Church of Scientology has gotten from donations?<br><br>Simply because they are ABUSING their position and abusing the faith of their followers. In 1994 Andre Tabayoyon ,a former Scientologist has admitted that funds were misapropriated and used for special facilities open only to Celebrity Scientologist (Now we know why Travolta and Cruise are scientologists).<br><br>I will leave further judgements to yourself. But consider closely, why is a rational state like Germany refusing to reconize Scientology and even classifying it as a extremist right wing group?</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Read the topmost post again.<br> <br> For starters, Scientology abuses its own members by placing a high
              amount of pressure on them through practices such as Disconnection
              which essentially forces them to sever ties with anyone they know
              that has denounced Scientology.<br> <br> Scientology also shuns modern medicine and has used its own form of
              medical treatments that has killed several members of its church.
              If you practice Scientology without any approval of the Church, it
              is considered a copyright infringement and thus can be sued for
              violation of copyright and trademark law. What sort of faith
              requires you to be a full fledged member of it's church in order to
              practice it and why such a requirement?<br> <br> A simple inference would tell you the obvious. The church is
              abusing the position it has to defraud its members, it would
              obviously want more members officially so as to be able to collect
              more "donations".<br> <br> The Church also has its infamous "fair game policy" in which people
              who have been declared "enemies" of the church, can be "deprived of
              property, or injured by any means. May be sued,lied to , tricked or
              destroyed." Quoted from from HCOPL Oct. 18, 1967 Issue IV,
              <em>Penalties for Lower Conditions.</em> This is no worse than the
              Islamic extremist groups that are considered terrorist
              globally.<br> <br> Why complain about the money the Church of Scientology has gotten
              from donations?<br> <br> Simply because they are ABUSING their position and abusing the
              faith of their followers. In 1994 Andre Tabayoyon ,a former
              Scientologist has admitted that funds were misapropriated and used
              for special facilities open only to Celebrity Scientologist (Now we
              know why Travolta and Cruise are scientologists).<br> <br> I will leave further judgements to yourself. But consider closely,
              why is a rational state like Germany refusing to reconize
              Scientology and even classifying it as a extremist right wing
              group?</p>

              <p>I deal only with facts, not fiction.  "Possession" is not a reconized sickness in medical science. Are you mistaking it with split personalities or schziophrenia. That is treated with medicine. Therefore your first argument has collasped onto itself. <br><br>Let me use my following example to point out anonymous does not care what you believe in, only what actions take place after that.<br><br>SO, I shall pretend that you have no foolishly shot yourself in the foot and assume you thought possession really existed! (Might want to go for a brain scan, tumour might be present) . So , if you go do (or don't) something the Church would condemn you for, lets say you get excommunicated from the Church/light . Alls well, since we shall assume it was between life and death you sook medical help. <br><br>So you leave the church alone and scientology leaves you alone? No. You're going to be outraged at the Church for doing that and you'll most likely complain to the local media and online forums.<br><br>Now this would be probably still acceptable if you are say Christian or Taoist. It isn't if you are a Scientologist as due to the Church's "Fair Game" policy which perhaps you would like to take a look at trusty wikipedia, which i'm sure you think is not going to oooohhh "cut it", it'll still seem flimsy because you simply don't have the brain cells to comprehend anything.<br><br>So i'm going to spoonfeed you because you have a baby brain that requires spoonfeeding. <br><br>Direct quote. Which is quoted from the source provided which is itself, a declassified Scientology document. I think thats epicly flimsy. <br><br>The Church also has its infamous "fair game policy" in which people

You NEED that documentation to tell someone you are a scientologist. Or else its a FELONY.<br><br>You said "The law was perverted but nothing is wrong with the law? Could

              <p>All this discussion is very very exciting and I can see that the regular thread derailing trolling (you know who you are...) has not happened yet. It's as if you can ALMOST smell the Cake at the birthday party for Lisa McPherson wanting to happen at Hong Lim park this weekend. But before anyone does anything potentially stupid and/or illegal,</p>
              <p>- Is there any way to check with the Singapore Government whether Scientology is recognized as an Official Religion or a Cult or some other neutral status?</p>
              <p>No speculations or unverifiable claims. Evidence should be something from the Government, like an Official Government website/document listing religions and/or cults or a letter from the relevant Ministry office, best if signed by the Minister. Something that explicitly states the Government's stand on Scientology. Singapore has very strict laws against Sedition. That and I believe Scientology has lawyers in Singapore too.</p>
              <p>Last I've checked with ROSES,
                  https://www.psi.gov.sg/NASApp/tmf/TMFServlet?app=MHA-SIR-RO-HOME ,
                  I wasn't able to find any record of Scientology or any of their other affiliated groups. Then again, maybe i wasn't looking very hard.</p>
              <p>tl;dr Don't Do Anything Stupid/Illegal. Check with the Government first. No permission, no parties.</p>

              <p>most ridiculous thing about scientology is that we can't seek help from doctos if we have illness?! what the hell kind of sense is that??!!!! so, if i've cancer or something, i should turn away from medical treatment and seek help from some scientology church?!</p>
              <p>hate to say this, but worshipping the devil is less sinful than worshipping some mad author who created "scientology".</p>
