            <div class='col-md body'>definately Ipod, although I havent bought one. Speaking of creative... i bought quite a number of products of theirs, infact the keyboard and mouse I'm using now are also from Creative...... the mouse got a bit of problem the second day after purchase... me and my bro bought the same mp3player from creative too... some 128MB mp3player.. and i realise it has really "limited" lifespan... after a year.. it became a bit haywire.. and ever since months ago.. it totally stopped working!!!! Now i don't even know where to repair it.. coz it'll be a waste to throw it away... i emailed creative to enquire about it's repairs.. seriously i don't mind paying to get it repaired.. but i get no reply from them...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>No more creative for me....<br><br>If u ask me to choose now... between Ipod or Zentouch or wadever stuffs from Creative, i'll definately choose Ipod..<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>p.s.

Why? While Apple will not discuss how much it makes on the various iPods, it is estimated that Apple gains about 20% profit from each DAP sold. With 33% of total earnings coming from the music player, the 45% number from the computer side of Apple is shrinking which is not good since that"s where the bulk of the profits come from for Apple.</blockquote><a href="http://channels.lockergnome.com/osx/archives/20060119_high_ipod_sales_means_low_profit_margins_for_apple.phtml" rel="nofollow">http://channels.lockergnome.com/osx/archives/20060119_high_ipod_sales_means_low_profit_margins_for_apple.phtml</a>[/code]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I owned a 30GB 5G iPod (Video) and I absolutely LOVE it. Anyway, on to replying some of the posts here...<br><br>Firstly, its <strong>iPod</strong><br><br>Secondly, regarding sound quality of the audio in iPods, Apple is catching up. One test in CHIP Magazine showed that the sound quality in iPod Shuffle is better then the Creative Zen series.<br><br>Thirdly, Creative is not creative at all. They had their own podcasts as well and named it Zencast. They said its to tell people that podcast not only applies to iPods alone. Well I only know that his Zencasts will only increase the popularity of podcasts. Both are the same thing, why is there the need to be given different names?<br><br>In addition, I feel that the cost of iPod is reasonable. Sure it may look more expensive compared to Creative but my friends who owned Creative MP3 players had plenty of problems. I'll go for durability here. Not to mention the beautiful screen iPod has and the sharpness of the videos are stunning.<br><br>Finally, the issue about how much Apple earns from iPod nano. Apple bought the flash disks for iPod nano in bulk, so naturally Apple will be able to buy them at a cheaper price. This may appear unfair to other MP3 manufacturers since Apple is a huge company who can easily buy flash disks in the millions. It seems that Apple bought the flash disks at 50% the original price.<br><br>In conclusion, iPod rules... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
