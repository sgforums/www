              <p>We only dislike the people who have attitude problems and personality issues... whether they are Singaporeans or PRCs or Indians or whichever country, that's not the point... It just happens that PRCs bring with them a certain culture (like how a child was knock down by a vehicle and dying and so many passerbys just look and walk past and only 1 old cleaning auntie has the heart to help...) from their country which doesn't fit well into Singapore.</p>
              <p>Some of the things about PRCs like talking very loudly (maybe last time they need to yell from village to village, I don't know...) or very rude behavior... these are the PRCs we don't like. But to be fair, there are nice ones too.</p>

              <p><br>i saw a WW2 movie of some chinese resistence fighting imeprial japanese soldiers. in the scene the city was over-run. they have tanks and the japs tailing behind for protection. the director actually choreography the battle scene showing the chinese soldiers hitting teh tnaks very hard instead of concentraiting fire on the vulnerable soldiers at the rear.</p>
              <p>in the initially bombardment stage of the battle when the city is not overurn, we sually hit their tranks and artillery hard. when the city has been overrun - no point hitting their armor, hit their footsoldier a.ka. infantry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the basics as depicted by the chinese chess rule - the chinese chess game where their own chinese director cannot decipher - i think he watched too much 'saving pte ryan' made 10 years back <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              some of you say PRCs think highly of themselves.
              go ask our neighbours what they think of us singaporeans.
              they say the same thing you are saying about the PRCs!!!
              
              dont the japs, the french, the brits and the americans think highly of themselves too?
              frankly i dont see singaporeans disliking them all that much.

              <p>If Singporeans don't like Chinese, then Singaporeans don't like themselves.</p>
              <p>Go outside of Singapore, the whites will call you "f....king chink", they don't  call you "f...king Singaporeans"</p>
              <p>Let's face it, there are good and bad Singaporeans, there are good and bad Chinese, there are good and bad Indians, there are good and bad Americans, Australians, Japanese, etc.</p>
              <p>To blame an entire group of people based on the action or stupidity or criminality of one person is unfair and uncalled for. </p>
              <p>Some years back, there was a Singaporean girl who became famous by having sex with hundreds of guys. Should we think all Singaporea women are whores? </p>
              <p>This is a very sad tragedy and the driver paid for it with his life. Let's leave his family, his people out of it. His family members are victims too.</p>

              <p>There are good and bad Chinese. There are good and bad Americans. There are good and bad Singaporeans but there are not many Singaporeans who are as stupid, uneducated , ignorant , so hopelessly inferior as you are.</p>

              <p>I am not Chinese nor Singaporean but I believe in equality of all people ; prejudice in this world created two World Wars and you have set yourself apart by being the most prejudiced person ever walked this planet earth. Your remind me of Hitler in Nazi Germany.</p>

              <p>What a hypocrite contradict yourself much? Please fuk off to the hell hole in which you came. I hate self proclaimed mother teresa like yourself. You're so stupid that you can't really see that singapore is victimise because it is a small nation. You're blind and oblivious to how the world really is. If anyone is a disgrace its yourself, trying to spread your little speech about equality here?? Maybe start by doing it in your own fucking country first</p>
              <p>We are Singaporeans living in Singapore. Singapore is our home, we should never have to feel inapt or ashamed by foreigners in our own country. Its the same thing when you invite your friends to your house. Naturally you will want them to follow your house rule. They come here to take advanatge of our strong economy and when they retire they go back to their homeland to enjoy but what about us Singaporeans? Don't you think we feel used and abused? We let them in so they get a better life and after they're done we're left alone to pick up their mess?</p>
