            <div class='col-md body'>HELP!!! There's this yandao guy I'm eyeing at the bus-stop outside my office and I don't know how to approach him. The thing is, he notices me too.<br>Let me relate what actually happened that day: I boarded this bus 9 (very crowded then as usual)after work and on my way home. Apparently, the bus route passes by the 9th Division Selarang Camp before it reaches my stop. And as usual, the bus will always have some NS men in em. That very Tuesday I recalled...when I board the bus (I was standing near the entrance cos it was packed) I noticed from a far a head peering out among the crowd, looking in my direction and at me. I thought nuthing of it and carried on day dreaming. As the bus alights some passesngers and boards new ones, I soon followed the standing crowd towards the rear of the bus and somehow got near the seat that that very NS guy who was peering at me from afar all along seating. Our eyes met . Some guys I know when you catch them staring at ya, they'll look away. But he didn't. He just kept on looking at me, as if he recognises me. The look he gave was like a cross between of "Hi, Miss can I get to know you?" to " Miss, you look familiar.".<br>I noticed him too, esp. that he was a real good looking guy. It was the look-into-each-other's-eye electric thingy. Anyway, he gotta alight not long later. Happens that at the bus stop he got off, there was an overhead bridge. He walked towards it and seems like he had to climb the bridge. The thing is,instead of walking off...he stood a few steps up from the bridge (eye level when the bus pass by cos I was already seated by then)and looked at me still. It was an obvious God damn beo-ing. Now... I have never got that kind of attention before. I could still remember how he looked like. Feeling was like "WOW"!<br>Anyway, due to the infrequency of the bus 9, I didn't saw him after that. But I did manage to check out his name on his Smart4. Was smething like Wong dunno what (forgot initials liao). How I regret not knowing him...<br>Ok,...I shall end it short here...the help I need is: How shall I approach a guy who seems to be interested in me or rather a guy I fancy without any sexual intention? Esp. for a gal like me who has never approached a guy before in my 22 yrs of life. I'm also sure many gals are dying to have some pick-up lines too....<br><br>------------------<br>LMG.Tang</div>

More like...makes him think that I'm approaching him just cos' he looks good. Thats part of the reason too and there's no denying it. But the main thing about him that catches my attention was the initial attention he gave me. I've got quite a number of guys looking and beo-ing me on the streets whenever I'm out but the feeling he gave me then was much more different. More as if...he knew me, or rather..he really, really wanted to know me but he daren't.<br>Reasons could be: 1)He was in his Smart4 and I heard one should maintain good discipline whenever he's in military wear.<br>2)The bus was damn packed then. Scarli I rejected him, imagine all those faces of the people around us staring at him in a strange way...<br><br>------------------<br>LMG.Tang</div>

What you can do is to ask for a street that does not exist. So you can ask and stump the 2 obstructive ladies first before proceeding to ask ur knight in smart 4. For e.g "Hi, does this bus go to Emerald City, I kinda need to look for the Wizard of Oz." Brush the befuddled women aside, and ask the guy "Hi, may I know the way to Wong(read his name tag) 's heart?"<br><br>Or another strategy which I thot of: When the bus jerks forward, lose your balance and propel urself at high velocity towards him. There are 2 advantages to this method. 1. The projectile motion should drive any unwanted entities outta the way, including the seats and support bars. 2.The impact of the collision should break any ice and start conversation rolling at once. For e.g "I think I've a broken rib, pls call 995."<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by LMG.Tang:</div><div class="quote_body">As for his camp...I dunno if he happens to be there when I 1st met him. he might be from 9th division. maybe not. maybe he's just a passer by. or someone who rarely takes the bus.<br>The bus 9 is always packed by the time it reaches the bus stop at my office.

If it's not Monday, chances that he is a 8 to 5 wuzzie, and he'll be taking the bus everyday. See which stop he gets on, and go down the bus stop there to wait.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by LMG.Tang:</div><div class="quote_body">...I dunno when I can meet him again.<br>But if I do meet him again...I wouldn't let the chance pass again.

And chances are that u'll embarass him by picking him up on the bus. My independent advice is that, forget about the heartless man and go for the one who is easily available to you, e.g the gentleman who is writing these words.<br><br>p.s: I'm not petty about pick up lines, just any will do.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Axl (edited 03 September 2000).]</div>

If you are sure that he was looking at you and not some other lady behind you. You can use this one liner<br><br>" I notice that you are looking at my direction, may I ask what you are looking at"<br><br>A guy will always have doubt to approach a lady on a crowded bus. The reason is the same, just like you, guy will be paiseh if he get reject in front of so many people.<br><br>So smile at him with all your charm to give him enough confidence to approach you.<br><br>Hope fate give you another chance.<br><br>------------------<br>Gerald<br>SinglesONE.com</div>
