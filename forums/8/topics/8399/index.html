            <div class='col-md body'>I have been thinking and I'd love to hear your opinion.  Say, will it be better if we do not limit ourselves only to a partner, instead each one has multiple partners and the partners have their own multiple partners.<br>I am not <strong>exclusively</strong> advocating orgies but look at it this way, if you are fed up with one partner you can look for a more pleasant company in another.  That way your heart has less risk of being killed and chopped to pieces by one Mr. Big Mistake.<br><br>I am not so certain that it will be easy to see someone you love runs away to someone else's lap when things get slightly too rocky, but if I get to do the same thing I think it will not hurt so bad.<br><br>And yeah, I know that this easy lifestyle is showing an incredible lack of commitment and perhaps responsibility, we may never learn to cope with relationship crisis if we insist on running away each time but those migrating fish and birds run away from the winter each time and I think they don't have it that bad.<br><br>Why does it have to be only one him/her anyway?<br><br>------------------<br>All suffering comes from a person's inability to sit still and be alone.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You have an interesting thought there, MayaJade. It's true when you say that one will be hurt less badly if he/she has another partner to turn to when a relationship turns rocky. But, how will the person you turn to feel when you approach him in tears after a big fight with one of your "partners"? Say, you may feel consoled to have someone there for you but he may feel himself to be a substitute. Every individual is unique and different and one should never treat another as a tool for escape.<br><br>Hmm, the pain may be less excruciating when you can seek another but what if things turn to turn ok between you and your previous partner? Are you going to leave your present partner for him? You will be put in a dilemma. And won't you have even more heartache and cause more hurt when you have to make a choice then?<br><br>To the question of "Why does it have to be only him/her", I feel that one can only <strong>love</strong> a person at one time. Yes, you can <strong>like</strong> a few persons at one time but NOT love. So, there can only be ONE dear.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> When you truly care for that special someone, you won't want to be unfaithful and hurt him/her. When you already accept him/her as the one, you are ready to share not only laughter and joy but also tears and sadness with him.<br><br>Well, if he/she chooses to hurt you eventually, just too bad. Life goes on and mayeb he/she is NOT the one after all? Carry on with life and not live in sorrow or misery. The right one will appear some day. Keep an open mind. Getting heartbreak is part and parcel of relationship and of life. We should NOT avoid it. It makes us stronger......  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>=================================<br>Do Pixies like a rainy day?<br>A-piping through the dell?<br>The Pixies must enjoy the rain;<br>Thats when they weave their spell.<br>Rain drops, rain drops<br>Play a Pixie-tune<br>=================================</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mayajade<br>This is indeed a defence mechanism to prevent oneself from getting hurt! Multiple partners seems very enticing but at the end of the day, u get nothing because no one treats u seriously. I mean face it..the difference between a stud and a slut...This what the society is good at,"labelling". Can you imagine there will be ppl telling your mum, "Hey I have seen your daughter coming out with a man from the hotel and isn't her bf the student from XXX university?" Yes, gossips are everywhere. One can run but they can't hide.<br><br>And finally, where the word commitment and love comes into place. No decent man would actually takes u seriously because of your past sexual exploits and if one day pregnancy were to occur. whose child is it going to be? There will be shirking of responsiblities and what to do u end up with? Either abortion or have to have a baby born out of wedlock.<br><br>There are lots of considerations and consequences to bear. True love comes from the heart and not from the mind.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A very interesting idea that most playboys and playgals must have thought of, strolling down the street with their present half while eyeing at another. Even most people must have conjured up this fantasy whenever they had a quarrel with their respective half or when the word boredom is written all over their half's face.<br><br>I have personally toyed with this idea for sometime and finds it exciting, to say the least. Like this, the parties involved can only have happy times. Feeling the blues??? No problem, Gal B or Hunk C is always around to soothe your ego and pamper to your every need. Yes, on paper, it sounds so nice and hey presto, no more broken hearts and lonely nights<br><br>In truth??? Nay...it hurts too much. Knowing that your partner has hunk or gal B, C, D to turn to whenever something sours. It hurts knowing that your loved one is out enjoying other people's intimate company. And boy does it hurts when they do comparison and tells you how good B, C and D can be.<br>Yes, it hurts so much that I rather take the risk of monogamy, loving someone full heartedly and suffer the consequences. At least I don't have to share and compete...and suffer the green eyed monster every second of my life.<br><br>And yeah, talking about multiple partners...I would suggest you look for it in the realm of virtual world. Yes, flirt and pout in ICQ or whatever suits your whim. Turn to your cyber partner whenever something bad happens or when your half is starting to gets on your nerves. After all, when everything is over, the mess is easier to clean up and you can always go to bed sleeping soundly, knowing that you had not betrayed your half.<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>

Noooosiree, she's a slut, haw haw, period.  I know gossip will finally catch up but isn't it almost inevitable?  I'll be damned if I do/don't do things just because other people may make some noise about it.  Besides, if I were to take this sort of lifestyle, I cause nobody harm, so they should go ahead with their lives and shut up.<br><br>It will be wonderful to find someone so secure who does not spend his time counting how many have been here before him.  Many will not take me seriously but oh sweet if I can find the gem of a man who's better than that because that's exactly the sort of a man I really want.<br><br>As for a child, sigh, it's another matter.  That depends whether I want to have a child or not.  I have no problem with having a child out of wedlock just as long as I can take good care of her/him.  Hopefully I'll be good enough to teach the child that there are more important things in life (to enjoy?) rather than fixating oneself on having a biological father who loves one.<br><br>Well, I suppose my values in life are different from others so refrain from "scolding" me if I sound like I dismiss everything just to validate my idea.

Well, i don't mind listening to him for a while but I sure do hope that he won't be going on about her for days because if he's that obsessed, he might as well stay with her and her alone.  Every individual is indeed unique and if I may, doesn't that make my proposal even more interesting?  Now we'll have more of these unique individuals to appreciate and hang out with.<br></strong><br><br>Yes, MayaJade, it will be nice to actually be able to hang out with the different unique individuals and to appreciate with but jealousy is in every human being, won't one of your partners be jealous of another? So who will you spend more time with?  Partner A, B, C... (the list goes on)? The game that you are playing is just seeking an escape. If Partner A hurts you, you will turn to Partner B. Say, Partner B is hurt by his gf and turn to you while you are with Partner A, what are you going to do? Hang around with both guys? Also, you mentioned that if a guy comes crying to you in tears and keep lamenting on the girl who breaks his heart, you wil be better off alone right? But hey, you are not giving this guy a chance here! Aren't you supposed to be there for him? *SHRUGS*  Between, will you really feel nothing if one of your partners has a fight with you and runs away in another girl's embrace? Can you take that especially if you truly care for this guy and the fight is due to a misunderstanding?<br><br><strong><br>pixie_gal and moose<br>In this sort of relationship, there is no leaving or returning.  Have you ever considered if most of our reactions in relationship are kneejerk ones blinded by so much emotion?  That's why if one looks back the memory of fights and other bitter things are not as hurtful as they felt when they were actually taking place.  If you go somewhere else to cool off, perhaps being away from a someone gives you a better perspective to analyze your earlier crisis with.<br></strong><br><br>Hmm, why must you seek refuge in another guy when you can actually analyze the crisis with your friends around you? That's what friends are for. I am sure they will be there to aid you. Moreover, when you turn to that 'somebody' after having a fight with your guy, you will be emotionally unstable and vulnerable. And by seeking comfort in this 'somebody', are you being fair to him?<br><br><strong><br>I am not certain about loving only a person at a time thing.  Firstly, up till now I am not sure how love feels.  What is love?  How do you know if it's love and how can you predict how that feeling is gonna change in, say, 20 years time?  I am sure many divorcing couples felt they loved that other when they decided to get hitched, what is left from that love now?<br></strong><br><br>Well, I believe that those couples truly love each other and the divorce could be due to other factors. People change and as they change, one party may find it harder to accept another. What is love.... well I am afraid I can't answer that.... I am still exploring that.... *SHRUGS* Anyway, your idea of multiple partners is appealing but like I say, if I care for someone, I won't want to hurt him for anything...... especially by running into another guy's arms after a quarrel! Well, do what you deem fit, I am sure you know yourself best.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> But take care of that fragile heart and make sure that not more heartbreaks will occur.    :p<br><br>------------------<br>=================================<br>Do Pixies like a rainy day?<br>A-piping through the dell?<br>The Pixies must enjoy the rain;<br>Thats when they weave their spell.<br>Rain drops, rain drops<br>Play a Pixie-tune<br>=================================<br><br>[This message has been edited by pixie_gal (edited 20 July 2000).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by pixie_gal (edited 20 July 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear MayaJade,<br><br>After given some serious thoughts, this is what I come up with. It may be just a string of opinions which differ from perspectives, or perhaps, possible reasons to why I would or would not advocate a "merry go round".<br><br>First of all, let me go back to the start, if we truly agree, monogamy is a social construct, because it is very likely that most human civilizations started off as polygamy or polyandre or even both(at the same time). That is the first argument which I am about to give you, the biological argument which favours your side of the argument. I used an example how I came to this argument a year ago when I watched a movie. It came from after watching the movie "Eyes Wide Shut", when Nicole Kidman confesses to Tom Cruise about her sexual fantasies with a naval officer, and she said something like the guy wanted, she would have forsaken her family and left with him. Although one could dismiss this on the account of an idea, but it could have happened. It started to make me think whether fidelity is possible in the survival of a  biological species. I came to a thought that perhaps, that it is in our genes that we have tendencies of infidelity and that is scary, because we can always have the power to hurt someone we love. If the biological argument really works, then we can have multiple partners, but what it merely suggests, is perhaps, we would not take each other seriously anymore, and our children might do the same, and sooner or later, human civilization would cease to exist. That is the point, if it is a biological thing, we can start mass orgies every day<br><br>To go further, I would invoke the second argument, the social construct of monogamy. If I did not remember wrongly, monogamy was instituted by the church in the middle ages, where they want to institute rights for women. One could say that it is a first step to sexual equality to some context. What it helps to do, is to impose responsibility and virtues of faithfulness to the other party. Morality, as agreed by common ground here, is defined and conditioned by society of that era.<br><br>If I am not wrong, faithfulness and fidelity are fudical virtues which human society has evolved based on how it trangress across the 5000 years. Our values are changing and perhaps till a day, poly-gamy and -andre would be allowed again, that is if HIV has not wiped out the entire race thru that means.<br><br>I would like to say that I would prefer to have a single partner in real life, because I am looking for a serious relationship. In that same analogy, it is also why I cannot find happiness thru one night stands. As, I mentioned many times, someone told me that I would be much happier if I could have allowed one night stands. Just because I want to satisfy my sexual desires, and go and sleep with someone, and the next morning, the gal and I go thru seperate ways. Believe it or not, I have not experienced it yet, but if I ever do, I would feel very painful and ashamed of myself, because it made me feel very bad. The next line being an opinion, I feel that I am "cheap" in some sense. I knew that everyone would disagree with me about being "cheap". It is not what the society thinks which made me feel this way. It is self-dignity. I feel bad, because I am ashamed of myself, and I do not care about what others think.<br><br>Come back to the same line to MayaJade, it does not matter what people think, it is how u value yourself  and that is the most important. Even if people branded you a slut, but you just can not bother and live happily, then my answer to you, is why not, your ideas do work.<br><br>Well, that took me sometime...<br><br>yours<br>Prodigal<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>*sniff sniff* did someone mention polygamy?<br><br>the distinction between sex and emotional satisfaction has been drawn time and again by utopianist throughout history.<br><br>in charles fourier's phalanstery, he advocated sexual needed to be de-stigmatised and serviced by a particular group of women and men who were ordained by the phalanstery. to fourier, man's (and women's) desire to fulfill the totality of his passionate nature was the will of God. and since nature and nature's God had bestowed passions on mankind, they must be afforded absolute freedom of expression.<br><br>to fourier, many of society's ills stemmed from petty jealousies and repression (in every type of manifestation), hence to curb, restrain or to repress a desire was contrary to nature, hence a potential source of corruption.<br><br>within this phalanstery, its citizens, or harmonians, would work hard, fufilling respective potential in labour and academia. sexual maturity would be encouraged since it came with anatomic acknowledgement and primal fufillment. partners would be rotated to keep emotional attachments at a minimum. the select group of men and women ordained to teach younger members technical skills whilst these members sought emotional growth and maturity from academics and philosophers.<br><br>ah well, the french.....<br><br>cheers</div>
