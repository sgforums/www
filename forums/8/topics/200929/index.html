            <div class='col-md body'>The Electric New Paper :<br>Woman in nude squat video tells police:<br>Pay me $4m or I'll sue<br>She hires lawyers, sets 2-week deadline<br>THE woman at the centre of the nude squat video controversy that rocked Malaysia is now demanding compensation from the government and the police.<br>19 July 2006<br><br>THE woman at the centre of the nude squat video controversy that rocked Malaysia is now demanding compensation from the government and the police.<br><br>Ms Hemy Hamisa Abu Hassan Saari, 23, has threatened to sue if she is not paid RM10 million ($4.3m).<br><br>She filed a letter of demand yesterday asking for a reply within the next 14 days.<br><br>At a press conference in his office yesterday, Ms Hemy's lawyer Mr Baljit Singh Sidhu gave wrongful and negligent detention as the reasons for the claim.<br><br>He added that his client had been publicly humiliated as a result of this incident.<br><br>He said: 'Although it has been a year since the incident, she is still traumatised.'<br><br>The nude squat saga began on 29 Jun last year, when Ms Hemy and five others were arrested for alleged drug possession.<br><br>At the Petaling Jaya police station, she was made to strip naked and perform squats.<br><br>SECRET RECORDING<br><br>Unknown to her, a police officer at the station recorded the incident with a handphone camera.<br><br>The 70-second video began to circulate via MMS.<br><br>It made headlines when it surfaced in the Malaysian media in November.<br><br>The woman in the video was initially wrongly identified as a Chinese national, sparking off a protest from China.<br><br>It was only in December last year that Ms Hemy came forward to say that she was the one who had been filmed.<br><br>Because of this episode, the Malaysian authorities set up a Nude Squat Inquiry Commission.<br><br>A probe was conducted on police strip-search procedures.<br><br>Ms Hemy told reporters: 'I am very unhappy because of the way the police handled this matter. What happened to me was not fair.'<br><br>She was at the press conference with her husband Kamarul Hamri Mohd Latif and her father-in-law Mohd Latif Daud.<br><br>She also told The Star that she hoped that anyone who had the video would destroy it.<br><br>She added: 'I cannot even get out of my house these days without getting stares. I am scared, ashamed and embarrassed.<br><br>DIRTY LOOKS<br><br>'I just don't know where to put my face when people who suspected or knew I was the woman in the video give me dirty looks.'<br><br>She and her husband wanted to move out of Kuala Lumpur, to a place where no one recognised her.<br><br>But they could not afford to, as they were both unemployed.<br><br>Ms Hemy said she had watched the video, and hated the scene.<br><br>She added: 'I hate the policeman who took the shot. I will not forgive him for the rest of my life. He was cruel to do this to me.<br><br>'I want to forget the whole episode. I am embarrassed by the video. Please give me my life back.'<br><br>Deputy Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Musa Hassan said that the man who took the video was 'no longer a policeman'.<br><br>He told The Star he had not yet been informed about the woman's demands.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
