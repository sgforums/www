And also to clarify, I never meant to say anything bad about Christians in my post, just specifically Ho Yeow Sun (as the topic is about her). Not all Christians are like her, she doesn't in any way represent all Christians though she has a high profile in City Harvest and her hubby is the pastor of CHC.<br><br>In any sense, I still hold on to my point that she is highly contradictory. To her, glamour and wealth is honouring God. That's why CHC is using their money to build a grand church premises, or has it been built, I'm not sure. She has been heard telling CHC goers that we must honour God. I mean, honestly please, speak from your heart Christians, does God need to be honoured with all these? God needs respect just simply with our faith and prayers. On the other hand, I am positive greed is a sin. Almost in all religions too.<br></div>
