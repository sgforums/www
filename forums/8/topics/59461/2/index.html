But the point is, this isn't where she is wrong! She is wrong because she TELLS her followers that glamour and all the glitz and money spent all around is honouring God! And to sincerely preach or sing songs or hymns about God, praising Him etc, most appropriately should be done in any manner except those that qualifies her for trendy image changes, award shows etc. How different is that from being a teenybopper idol?<br><br>Idolism again is nothing wrong. It is what her ideals in her career that is upside down.</div>

And also to clarify, I never meant to say anything bad about Christians in my post, just specifically Ho Yeow Sun (as the topic is about her). Not all Christians are like her, she doesn't in any way represent all Christians though she has a high profile in City Harvest and her hubby is the pastor of CHC.<br><br>In any sense, I still hold on to my point that she is highly contradictory. To her, glamour and wealth is honouring God. That's why CHC is using their money to build a grand church premises, or has it been built, I'm not sure. She has been heard telling CHC goers that we must honour God. I mean, honestly please, speak from your heart Christians, does God need to be honoured with all these? God needs respect just simply with our faith and prayers. On the other hand, I am positive greed is a sin. Almost in all religions too.<br></div></blockquote>i agree. God certainly doesn't need these kind of offerings.. He is the provider, He already has them..<br><br>and isn't it written in the bible that God desires obedience more than sacrifices?<br><br>but then again, is it wrong to build a church to glorify God? in king solomon times, He build a wonderful temple for God, was it wrong?<br><br>it is also written in romans 14<br><br><blockquote>Accept him whose faith is weak, <span style="color: red;">without passing judgment on disputable matters</span>. One man's faith allows him to eat everything, but another man, whose faith is weak, eats only vegetables. <span style="color: red;">The man who eats everything must not look down on him who does not, and the man who does not eat everything must not condemn the man who does, for God has accepted him. Who are you to judge someone else's servant</span>? To his own master he stands or falls. And he will stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand. </blockquote>in the end. we are all accountable to God. we are all God's servant(talking abt christians) who are we to judge each other, we are all at the same level.<br><br>pastor sun's faith level convinces  her there is nothing wrong in eating meat. your faith level may only allow u to eat vegetables. in application to her actions in the media.<br><br>all these are disputable matters, its a grey area, which doesn't say its openly wrong, or right..<br><br>but my point is, that she is condemned, not because she act cute. those who say so.. are just using excuses.. if u want to hate her. fine. but do it honestly.</div>
