Have you ever wondered why more and more kids are acting really wierd? Girls behaving like guys and guys behaving like girls. It is the food we eat. There was a time when my son, age 14 starting developing breast like chest. After checking with the hawkers selling chicken, they specifically told me boys should avoid eating breast meet as it probably contains the most synthetic estrogens that are available in chicken feed.<br><br>I was told by the Managing Director of a company that rears millions of chickens in China the following information. They are a large company that hires more than 10,000 workers in China and he told me this. Do you know the chicken that you're eating on the table is only 45 days old? How do you think they grew so big and so fast. On one hand you might be thinking that the poultry companies are responsible but don't fall for the Obama trap. We need to see who are the<br>real puppet masters behind the scene. The company that sells synthetic estrogen is a company called Searle Co. They are a division of Monsanto. Monsanto is a giant company that genetically modifies the seeds to kill people. On the pretence of selling farmers in 3rd world countries with seeds that produces better yield, they genetically modify the seeds to grow into plants that have insecticide, viruses and cancer causing agents in them thus slowly killing the people.</p></div>

              <p>&lt;&lt;&lt; THE FOOD WE EAT &gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br>Once they control the money, the next thing they want to control is the food. Have you ever wondered why more and more kids are acting really wierd? Girls behaving like guys and guys behaving like girls. It is the food we eat. There was a time when my son, age 14 starting developing breast like chest. After checking with the hawkers selling chicken, they specifically told me boys should avoid eating breast meet as it probably contains the most synthetic estrogens that are available in chicken feed.<br><br>I was told by the Managing Director of a company that rears millions of chickens in China the following information. They are a large company that hires more than 10,000 workers in China and he told me this. Do you know the chicken that you're eating on the table is only 45 days old? How do you think they grew so big and so fast. On one hand you might be thinking that the poultry companies are responsible but don't fall for the Obama trap. We need to see who are the<br>real puppet masters behind the scene. The company that sells synthetic estrogen is a company called Searle Co. They are a division of Monsanto. Monsanto is a giant company that genetically modifies the seeds to kill people. On the pretence of selling farmers in 3rd world countries with seeds that produces better yield, they genetically modify the seeds to grow into plants that have insecticide, viruses and cancer causing agents in them thus slowly killing the people.</p>
