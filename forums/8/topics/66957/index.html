The 83-year-old pope viewed the film on a video monitor in his apartments, the source said.<br><br>Abraham H. Foxman, U.S. director of the Anti-Defamation League, said the group would respect the pope's views<br><br>"The pope has a record and history of sensitivity to the Jewish community and has a clear moral voice and understanding when it comes to anti-Semitism," Foxman said.<br><br>"We hope that Mel Gibson has heard our concerns and those of Christian and Jewish scholars and religious leaders, who expressed unease about the earlier version... and its potential to fuel, rationalize and legitimize anti-Semitism," he said.<br><br>Many Vatican officials have seen the film in its latest form and have rejected charges of anti-Semitism.<br><br>"I loved it and it is not anti-Semitic," Father Augustine Di Noia, a senior official in the Vatican's doctrinal department, told Reuters on Thursday.<br><br>Asked if the film was as violent as has been reported, Di Noia said: "It not just violent, it's brutal."<br><br>Cardinal Dario Castrillon Hoyos, head of the Vatican department in charge of priests, liked it so much he said in September: "I would gladly trade some of the homilies that I have given about the passion of Christ for even a few of the scenes of his film."<br><br>Gibson paid $20 million to $25 million of his own money to make the movie, but despite his status as a top box office draw and Oscar winner, Hollywood's major studios shied away from distributing the film due to the controversy surrounding it.<br><br>The film is based on Gospel narratives and contains dialogue only in Latin, Hebrew and Aramaic, the vernacular of ancient Palestine.<br><br>Gibson is a member of a traditionalist Roman Catholic group that rejects some of the reforms of the Second Vatican Council and still uses the old-style Latin Mass<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">It Is as It Was  </span></strong><br>PEGGY NOONAN<br>wsj.com<br>Wall Street Journal<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">'It Is as It Was' </span><br>Mel Gibson's "The Passion of The Christ" gets a thumbs-up from the pope.<br><br>Wednesday, December 17, 2003 1:06 p.m. EST<br><br>Here's some happy news this Christmas season, an unexpected gift for those who have seen and admired Mel Gibson's controversial movie, "The Passion," and wish to support it. The film has a new admirer, and he is a person of some influence. He is in fact the head of the Holy Roman Catholic and Apostolic Church.<br><br>Pope John Paul II saw the movie the weekend before last, in the Vatican, apparently in his private rooms, on a television, with a DVD, and accompanied by his closest friend, Msgr. Stanislaw Dziwisz. Afterwards and with an eloquent economy John Paul shared with Msgr. Dziwisz his verdict. Dziwisz, the following Monday, shared John Paul's five-word response with the co-producer of The Passion, Steve McEveety.<br><br>This is what the pope said: "It is as it was."<br><br>View Full Article<br><a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/?id=110004442" rel="nofollow">http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/?id=110004442</a><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong> A News Anchor's Perspective on "The Passion of the Christ"<br>Jody Dean<br>Dallas/Ft. Worth anchor, CBS News </strong><br><br>There have been tons of e-mails and forwards floating around recently from those who have had the privilege of seeing Mel Gibson's The Passion Of The Christ prior to its actual release.<br><br>I thought I'd give you my reaction after seeing it last [week.]<br><br>I want you to know that I started in broadcasting when I was 13-years-old.  I have been in the business of writing, performing, production and broadcasting for a long time. I have been a part of movies, radio, television, stage and other productions - so I know how things are done.  I know about soundtracks and special effects and make-up and screenplays.  I think I have seen just about every kind of movie or TV show ever made - from extremely inspirational to extremely gory.  I read a lot - and have covered stories and scenes that still make me wince. I also have a vivid imagination, and have the ability to picture things as they must have happened - or to anticipate things as they will be portrayed.  I have also seen an enormous amount of footage from Gibson's film, so I thoughtI knew what was coming. But there is nothing in my existence - nothing I could have read, seen, heard, thought or known - that could have prepared me for what I saw on screen last night.<br><br>This is not a movie that anyone will "like".  I don't think it's a movie anyone will "love".  It certainly doesn't "entertain".  There isn't even the sense that one has just watched a movie. What it is: an experience - on a level of primary emotion that is scarcely comprehensible.  Every shred of human preconception or predisposition is utterly stripped away. No one will eat popcorn during this film.  Some may not eat for days after they've seen it. Quite honestly, I wanted to vomit.  It hits that hard.<br><br>I can see why some people are worried about how the film portrays the Jews.  They should be worried. No, it's not anti-Semitic.  What it is, is entirely shattering.  There are no "winners".  No one comes off looking "good" - except Jesus.<br><br>Even His own mother hesitates.<br><br>As depicted, the Jewish leaders of Jesus' day merely do what any of us would have done - and still do.  They protected their perceived "place" - their sense of safety and security, and the satisfaction of their own "rightness".<br><br>But everyone falters.<br><br>Caiphus judges.<br><br>Peter denies.<br><br>Judas betrays.<br><br>Simon the Cyrene balks.<br><br>Mark runs away.<br><br>Pilate equivocates.<br><br>The crowd mocks.<br><br>The soldiers laugh.<br><br>Longinus still stabs with his pilus.<br><br>The centurion still carries out his orders.<br><br>And as Jesus fixes them all with a glance, they still turn away.<br><br>The Jews, the Romans, Jesus' friends - they all fall.<br><br>Everyone, except the Principal Figure.<br><br>Heaven sheds a single, mighty tear - and as blood and water spew from His side, the complacency of all creation is eternally shattered.<br><br>The film grabs you in the first five seconds, and never lets go.  The brutality, humiliation, and gore are almost inconceivable - and still probably does not go far enough.  The scourging alone seems to never end, and you cringe at the sound and splatter of every blow - no matter how steely your nerves.  Even those who have known combat or prison will have trouble, no matter their experience - because this Man was not conscripted.  He went willingly, laying down His entirety for all.<br><br>It is one thing for a soldier to die for his countrymen.  It's something else entirely to think of even a common man dying for those who hate and wish to kill him.<br><br>But this is no common man.  This is the King of the Universe. The idea that anyone could or would have gone through such punishment is unthinkable - but this Man was completely innocent, completely holy - and paying the price for others.<br><br>He screams as He is laid upon the cross, "Father, they don't know.  They don't know..."<br><br>What Gibson has done is to use all of his considerable skill to portray the most dramatic moment of the most dramatic events since the dawn of time. There is no escape.  It's a punch to the gut that puts you on the canvas, and you don't get up.  You are simply confronted by the horror of what was done - what had to be done - and why.<br><br>Throughout the entire film, I found myself apologizing.<br><br>What you've heard about how audiences have reacted is true.<br><br>There was no sound after the film's conclusion. No noise at all. No one got up. No one moved.  The only sound one could hear was sobbing.<br><br>In all my years of public life, I have never heard anything like that.<br><br>I told many of you that Gibson had reportedly re-shot the ending to include more "hope" through the Resurrection?  That's not true.  The Resurrection scene is perhaps the shortest in the entire movie - and yet it packs a punch that can't be quantified.  It is perfect.<br><br>There is no way to negotiate the meaning out of it.  It simply asks, "Now, what will you do?"<br><br>I'll leave the details to you,  in the hope that you will see the film - but one thing above all stands out, and I have to tell you about it.  It comes from the end of Jesus' temptations in the wilderness - where the Bible say Satan left him "until a more opportune time."<br><br>I imagine Satan never quit tempting Christ, but this film captures beyond words the most opportune time. At every step of the way, Satan is there at Jesus' side - imploring Him to quit, reasoning with Him to give up, and seducing Him to surrender.  For the first time, one gets a heart-stopping idea of the sense of madness that must have enveloped Jesus - a sense of the evil that was at His very elbow.  The physical punishment is relentless - but it's the sense of psychological torture that is most overwhelming.<br><br>He should have quit.  He should have opened His mouth.  He should have called 10,000 angels.<br><br>No one would have blamed Him.  What we deserve is obvious.<br><br>But He couldn't do that.<br><br>He wouldn't do that.<br><br>He didn't do that.<br><br>He doesn't do that.<br><br>It was not and is not His character.<br><br>He was obedient, all the way to the cross - and you feel the real meaning of that phrase in a place the human heart usually doesn't dare to go.  You understand that we are called to that same level of obedience.  With Jesus' humanity so irresistibly on display, you understand that we have no excuse.<br><br>There is no place to hide.<br><br>The truth is this: Is it just a "movie"?<br><br>In a way, yes.  But it goes far beyond that, in a fashion I've never felt - in any forum.<br><br>We may think we "know".<br><br>We know nothing.<br><br>We've gone 2,000 years and are used to the idea of a pleasant story, and a sanitized Christ.<br><br>We expect the ending, because we've heard it so many times.<br><br>God forgive us.<br><br>This film tears that all away.<br><br>It's is as close as any of us will ever get to knowing, until we fully know.<br><br>Paul understood.  "Be urgent, in and out of season."<br><br>Luke wrote that Jesus reveals Himself in the breaking of the bread.<br><br>Exactly.<br><br>The Passion Of The Christ shows that Bread being broken.<br><br>Go see this movie.<br><br>Jody Dean is the Dallas/Ft. Worth anchor for CBS News.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>I haven't seen this movie yet but I am already confused.<br><br>Can anyone explain why the Jews are blamed for the death of Jesus Christ? And why, from many reports, that Jews are often portrayed as "evil" people? Well, from what I have seen in TV, magazines and newspapers, the Jews in Israel seems to be portrayed as the "evil" ones, bullying the Palestian people who took revenge by means of blowing themselves up in Israel?<br><br>Thanks in advance!</div>
