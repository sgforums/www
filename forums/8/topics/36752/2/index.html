I agreed tt it's very "face-losing" for parents.<br><br>Anyhow, answering your impt Qs first. UWA is not bad but just like NUS very traditional &amp; like old english style Uni. well recoginsed but - facilities is old esp. their Library is very old  . Its building is charming - old english . Dont know now .<br>Hwr, they don't offer foundation yr like Curtin or Murdoch.<br><br>For Curtin, you can join its foundation yr &amp; like what u said you work well with less pressure - I believe you will do very well for your foundation yr which most my friends did ( they didn't do well in S'pore then - &amp; go on to do even better at Curtin ).<br>This is a very good option , BTW I am not selling Curtin if anyone felt that way.<br><br>As for Curtin reputation :<br>FYI, I got into NTU Msc cse 98' (Hv to beat 2 others for the place thru interviews &amp; entrance exam).so it shdn't be a problem &amp; I joined an MNCs . My friends managed to work for very reputable cos like CitiBank , etc. Big six KPMG , HongKong Shaghai Bank ( my youner sis. also fr. Curtin joined this bank &amp; later  - got a MBA accountacy from NTU) so you can judge for yourself., .<br>Actually most Aust. Uni are recoginsed in S'pore but if you intend to join govt sector with that u can forget abt it.<br><br>I still prefer Curtin as it constantly  upgrade its facilities , build new Lecture hall, good library, Cafes - huge one like those in town, refresh its syllabus - FYI in 1995 they are alrdy offering Master In Internet - very forward looking &amp; in tune with the mkt.<br>And, the following yr , they offer Golf as a subject - see what I mean. I wld like to take it if offered during my time. Don't hv to struggle in S'pore &amp; paid a bomb for it &amp; pressurized by my boss to play with him &amp; clients.<br>In fact, they are putting back alot of our $ back into building new facilitites for students like us to use. I was surprise that I can actually enjoyed this benefit in my yr 2 &amp; 3 seeing my $ well paid for a great comfort bec. my parents are as well off compared to rich Pp. Most of the bldg are of red bricks quite modern &amp; beautiful.<br><br>Most importantly, Curtin offered double majors, many specialisation to choose from - in fact all biz spec. you can name of they offered.<br><br>Popular combination is Finance &amp; Accounting, Accounting &amp; Infor. system, Finance &amp; mkting etc.<br><br>For eg, for me I majored in Finance &amp; Mkting - so I went into regional sales job &amp; finance helps me to analyse &amp; undertand finance situation better esp. with my cos. accountant &amp; Mgt.<br><br>See their website for a full list , you'll be surprised:<br><br>http://www.curtin.edu.au/curtin/handbook/courses/indexes/curtin_business_school.html<br><br>Lastly, actually degree is a just basic paper is your EQ that sells &amp; counts , IQ without EQ is = nothing. Atitude counts. I realised it even better now that I am doing my own Biz.<br><br>If I missed anything let me know will answer later. If required, I can ask my local friend Chinese australian to help you with housing etc. if you hv prob.<br><br>Got to go for my evening job<br><br></div>
