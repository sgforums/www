            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>sorry to hear about your grades. Anyway I think it is true that singapore education is inflexible but having everyone take one standard exam is the only way they so far to determine a student's ability.<br>I believe if you are really sincere in picking yourself up from this point and study harder you can still make your mark in life. The is a place in singapore that handles most of the educational institue in Australia. Maybe you can check it out at this website. The location of the office is stated there as well.<br><br>http://www.idpea.com.sg<br><br>Hope this helps. Take care!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi aixuan,<br><br>It's ok to be at a loss with not so good " o" results. Don't despair.<br><br>First , tell you my story. For my "O". I got  4 B3 but a D7 for English due to carelessness -my english (usually avg at least B3 or better) - straight away no where to go. So no choice but went back to repeat in my own school .<br><br>Very embarrased then , teachers &amp; fellow students all looked down on us. But, I endured for myself &amp; my parents' faith in me and emerged among top 5 of the school for the following year "O"<br>I got 3A &amp; 2B &amp; got  into a top 5 JC.<br><br>FYI, I used to be in a Ah Beng govt sec school everyday fight &amp; play street football ( we invented it BTW)<br><br>Hence, the moral of story it to believe in yourself &amp; fight back hard, I believe work hard &amp; you'll be rewarded just like my case from 22 pointers to a 11 pointers. 100% improved<br><br>I suggest you redo at Maths &amp; accounts &amp; try for the Poly ( wonders if you still cobined 2 yrs result as one ? - our time ok)<br><br>As for Australia study - lots of problems you may face.<br><br>I did my degree in Curtin ( didn't manage to do well to do it in local Uni - but manage to got into NTU for its Msc - master degree cse ---- Funny Eh ??? That's Life ) I prefer poly actually more practical nowadays. More value than degree I feel.<br><br>FYI, for your case you can do at least a intensive foundation year b/4 you can go to a Uni (provided you pass &amp; meet a min. std) . You  still need to do maths &amp; I heard it is even more difficult than S'pore maths or the same at least. Education std there is pretty good , I going to send my children back for study from Kindergarden to UNi . if time comes.<br><br>But, I guessed it is easy for you to say you want an overseas study - first so expensive abt $30 per Yr total $90k at least just Uni only without foundation / pre-Uni yr. And, homesickness are you mentally strong enough to be indepedent - cook, wash your own clothes , look for &amp; rent a hse or room, go to a doctor when sick etc Many ??? to take care not a bed of roses  .<br><br>For me I am a guy - I love the life there ,love to cook , make friends easily including the local friends - chinese thou' - all these help to avoid/solve the above problems. I join the students councils<br><br>So think carefully - take a step back &amp; Ponder what you do best ?<br>Ask you seniors , what you go thru many hv gone thru - no Big Problem - Just need to face it .<br><br>Have a good talk with your Dad/Mum you'll understand - it is not the end of the world.<br><br>I been thru thr the state of mind you're in now.<br><br>So you still need more infor. let me know.<br><br>Sorry for the bad english - very tired .<br><br>Take care[/list][/quote]</div>

You are required to take 4 units each semester and there are 2 semester.<br><br>You will not be provided with Boarding House or Hostel facilities therefore there is the need for you to rent, buy, or choose homestay to accomodate your residential stuff.<br><br>From experience be prepared to spend around 20k per year including expenses.

Don't despair.<br><br>First , tell you my story. For my "O". I got  4 B3 but a D7 for English due to carelessness -my english (usually avg at least B3 or better) - straight away no where to go. So no choice but went back to repeat in my own school .<br><br>Very embarrased then , teachers &amp; fellow students all looked down on us. But, I endured for myself &amp; my parents' faith in me and emerged among top 5 of the school for the following year "O"<br>I got 3A &amp; 2B &amp; got  into a top 5 JC.<br><br>FYI, I used to be in a Ah Beng govt sec school everyday fight &amp; play street football ( we invented it BTW)<br><br>Hence, the moral of story it to believe in yourself &amp; fight back hard, I believe work hard &amp; you'll be rewarded just like my case from 22 pointers to a 11 pointers. 100% improved<br><br>I suggest you redo at Maths &amp; accounts &amp; try for the Poly ( wonders if you still cobined 2 yrs result as one ? - our time ok)<br><br>As for Australia study - lots of problems you may face.<br><br>I did my degree in Curtin ( didn't manage to do well to do it in local Uni - but manage to got into NTU for its Msc - master degree cse ---- Funny Eh ??? That's Life ) I prefer poly actually more practical nowadays. More value than degree I feel.<br><br>FYI, for your case you can do at least a intensive foundation year b/4 you can go to a Uni (provided you pass &amp; meet a min. std) . You  still need to do maths &amp; I heard it is even more difficult than S'pore maths or the same at least. Education std there is pretty good , I going to send my children back for study from Kindergarden to UNi . if time comes.<br><br>But, I guessed it is easy for you to say you want an overseas study - first so expensive abt $30 per Yr total $90k at least just Uni only without foundation / pre-Uni yr. And, homesickness are you mentally strong enough to be indepedent - cook, wash your own clothes , look for &amp; rent a hse or room, go to a doctor when sick etc Many ??? to take care not a bed of roses  .<br><br>For me I am a guy - I love the life there ,love to cook , make friends easily including the local friends - chinese thou' - all these help to avoid/solve the above problems. I join the students councils<br><br>So think carefully - take a step back &amp; Ponder what you do best ?<br>Ask you seniors , what you go thru many hv gone thru - no Big Problem - Just need to face it .<br><br>Have a good talk with your Dad/Mum you'll understand - it is not the end of the world.<br><br>I been thru thr the state of mind you're in now.<br><br>So you still need more infor. let me know.<br><br>Sorry for the bad english - very tired .<br><br>Take care[/list][/quote]</div></blockquote>you invented street soccer??
