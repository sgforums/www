The funnie thing is the only interection I had with kids, are stranger's kids / colleagues' kids. Will never bother looking at them / the tot of even touching / playing with them. Okay...had a nephew, who was hyper. But was under my mom's care. So damn naughty, really hated him!<br><br>I think I prefer cats to children. </div></blockquote>Hmm... I work with children <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> and it is strange that people assume that i LIKE children.<br><br>Thing is I like children but I dont like to FUSS over them.<br><br>Whether inside or outside of work, if I see kids that look cute, I do not like to go 'AIYOO SOOO CUTE" must carry must hug must pinch their cheeks. I find that type of behavioir very irritating. I also do not try my best to entertain kids when I see them - like must try to talk to them, disturb them, joke with them - maybe because I do that AT work so if friends bring their kids, I actually leave them alone UNLESS they want to ask me something or talk to me, I will talk to them. BUT will not go out of the way and "jiejie bring u okie?? jiejie buy for u OKAY??" Adults like this irritate me a lot. Actually I think adults who fusses over kids irritate me more than kids.<br><br>I also do not like act cute baby photos (refer to Anne Geddes), baby photos in general, act cute toddler photos, act cute kid photos, act cute kid/baby/toddler ring tones etc. I have no kids of my own as yet.<br><br>BUT children fascinate me. I find the way they think, the way they analyse very amazing and never fail to bring laughter and joy during the everyday that I interact with them. So I LIKE them.<br><br>I just dont like the way SOME other people LIKE them.<br><br>O I like cats too.<br><br></div>

I work with children <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> and it is strange that people assume that i LIKE children.<br><br>Thing is I like children but I dont like to FUSS over them.<br><br>Whether inside or outside of work, if I see kids that look cute, I do not like to go 'AIYOO SOOO CUTE" must carry must hug must pinch their cheeks. I find that type of behavioir very irritating. I also do not try my best to entertain kids when I see them - like must try to talk to them, disturb them, joke with them - maybe because I do that AT work so if friends bring their kids, I actually leave them alone UNLESS they want to ask me something or talk to me, I will talk to them. BUT will not go out of the way and "jiejie bring u okie?? jiejie buy for u OKAY??" Adults like this irritate me a lot. Actually I think adults who fusses over kids irritate me more than kids.<br><br>I also do not like act cute baby photos (refer to Anne Geddes), baby photos in general, act cute toddler photos, act cute kid photos, act cute kid/baby/toddler ring tones etc. I have no kids of my own as yet.<br><br>BUT children fascinate me. I find the way they think, the way they analyse very amazing and never fail to bring laughter and joy during the everyday that I interact with them. So I LIKE them.<br><br>I just dont like the way SOME other people LIKE them.<br><br>O I like cats too.<br><br></div></blockquote>I prefer dogs to cat to children. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
