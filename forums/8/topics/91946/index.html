            <div class='col-md body'>Anyone now in the process of renovating your HDB flat? What are you using for the flooring? Ceramic tiles, marbles or those laminated wood or parquet? I heard now fashion is go those wood but got bro's fren who live 5 years the wood pop up liao and then got stains and also if put heavy stuff after remove can see the dent. Seem wood cannot take heavy weight for long period.<br><br>How abt the ceiling and levelling of balcony to flush with living room floor? Toilet tiles and reno? Kitchen cabinets? Paint whole flat? Windows? Doors? You all look for ONE single source or spent time to co-ordinate the various items yourself?<br><br>Average reno price range is abt 30K?

            <div class='col-md body'>Price of renovation, obviously, depends on what you want to do. My advice is, do not take those package deal if you can afford it. Typically the workmanship and materials used are inferior.<br><br>Floors: Marble, tarazzo are natural material thus permeable, meaning water can sip in and can stain the flooring.<br><br>Ceramic tiles are cheaper but will have grouts<br><br>Wood panels may scratch easily and require a certain level of maintainance.<br><br>Personally I prefer homogeneous tiles. Cost more than ceramic but because the coloring in the tiles is the same as the outside, any chipping cannot be seen. They are also harder to crack and some contractors say that cutting is more difficult.<br><br>Toilet floors: consider slate. slight rougher texture so prevent slippage.<br>Toilet walls: ceramic will do.<br><br>Single source or multiple source: depend on yourself, whether you got time or not, whether you're hobbyist or not.<br><br>Good to extend hall to balcony if you don't need balcony.<br><br>Budget depend on new house/old house, materials, size of house.<br><br>30 grand will not get you very far if you want quality stuff.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Usually for renovation ppl tend to look for relatives or fren who have used that contracter services before. It is best to look at their finished products than say verbally how good to how good they are where practically everyone in the renovation business say they good price reasonable etc etc sales pitch.<br><br>I was thinking about your homogeneous ceramics hmm... worth considering. Abt 30K for minimal changes I think can make it. I dun intend to setup my home like those HDB walk-in selection style. Those style gonna cost you lotsa lotsa of $$$$$..... borrow house reno loan from bank is exorbitant considering the rates.....<br><br>Anyone try 30K and get a decent home done up nicely? Assume level balcony, seal toilet door one side open on the other side. Paint flat. Toilet do inside and install window grille for kitchen and balcony?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A lot of cost will go to the tiles.  Painting is quite cheap.  But then, all the renovation company will chop you, by marking up high.  After marking up, they make about 70% profits.<br><br>Can you imagine, they can charge you about $1600 for painting.  The paint cost about $300 only or less.  And the workers' pay is about $50 per day and it takes not more than 2 days to complete.  Besides, the $1600 price is for using lower quality paint.  If you want better paint, they will again mark up.<br><br>So don't be shy to bargain.<br><br>When choosing the renovation company, it's best to get friends to recommend.  Usually the contractors will give face, by not charging too high or by putting your works in higher priority.  Don't flip the yellowpages.<br><br>I have two friends who did reno at the same time.  One used yellowpages and the other got a relative to recommend.<br><br>In the end, the one who found hers on yellowpages met with a lot of problems.  The contractor somehow was not too keen on doing her works and was always doing works for other customers first, then do hers.<br><br>The other friend who got it from a relative, had her place nicely done and on time.<br><br>But both paid quite a lot of money.  More than $30,000.</div>
