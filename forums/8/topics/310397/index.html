              intend to use the remaining money to earn interest in bank under
              certain higher interest rates account. Do you think I should repay as
              much of the education loan as soon as possible so that I will not need
              to pay much interest rates or should I do it slowly while putting the

              <p>In your case, pay as much as possible to repay the loan. Unless the bank or whatever investment you do, is giving you way higher than 2.5%pa, say maybe above 5%.</p>
              <p>I'm not so sure about how CPF calculated their loan interest, but all banks calculate loan interest using a monthly-rest basis. Normal interest calculation is</p>
              <p>simple interest calculation: u have to pay = rate(%pa) * no of days own * amt own / 365</p>
              <p>monthly rest basis calculation is based on your loan tenor(LT) and monthly installments(MI). The shorter LT the higher the MI. BUT, interest is calculated every month. So part of your MI goes to reducing the outstanding (o/s) loan, part goes to pay the interest for that month, hence your o/s loan is reducing every mth. So based on this you'll realised very little of the MI goes to reducing the  o/s initially, as most  goes to reducing the interest.</p>

              <p>On the cpf site, it wrote "If payment is not made by 31/03/2008, additional interest at the rate of $ 49.59 per month must be added to the total amount repayable."</p>
