            <div class='col-md body'>Taken from Stomp<br><a href="http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/viewPost2788.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/viewPost2788.aspx</a><br><br>27-year-old Yileen Koh was shocked to pay S$130 for 2 D24 durians along Geylang, and she claims that they were not even worth the price.<br><br>The analyst was with a group of eight other people, walking along the main road close to Lorong 9, when they chanced upon this durian stall.<br><br>They were misled to try the durians, as they initially saw a sign stating that the stall was charging S$5 per durian.<br><br>Yileen told STOMP that they kept asking the seller what was the cost of the durians in mandarin, and they were told repeatedly by him to pay at the cashier. By then, he had already cut open two durians for them.<br><br>Â“By then, the durian was served, so in order not to dampen our high spirits, we did not bicker and just paid the lousy seller,Â” she wrote in an email.<br><br>Â“The durians were not even gray and your fingers usually get stained by the smell, if they are good. But all I had to do was to dip my fingers in water and the smell was gone. This reflects the quality of the durians he sold us,Â” she said.<br><br>Same story at Straits time<br><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/portal/site/STI/menuitem.c2aef3d65baca16abb31f610a06310a0/?vgnextoid=f832758920e39010VgnVCM1000000a35010aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=vgnartid:da5e007603d42110VgnVCM100000430a0a0aRCRD" rel="nofollow">http://www.straitstimes.com/portal/site/STI/menuitem.c2aef3d65baca16abb31f610a06310a0/?vgnextoid=f832758920e39010VgnVCM1000000a35010aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=vgnartid:da5e007603d42110VgnVCM100000430a0a0aRCRD</a><br>MY HUSBAND and I had an unpleasant experience more than a week ago at a Geylang durian stall.<br>On April 21, my husband with a group of friends decided to have some durian after dinner in Geylang.<br><br>We headed for this big durian stall opposite Geylang Lorong 11 which had tables and chairs for customers to eat the fruit at the premises.<br><br>We got ourselves a table and my husband went to choose the durians. Once he stepped inside the stall, he was approached by a durian seller who, without asking, started to open a durian and invited my husband to try the fruit.<br><br>My husband asked him how much the durian cost but his reply was: 'Never mind, just try first'. So my husband tried and commented that the durian was 'not bad'.<br><br>With this comment, the durian seller swiftly picked up five durians, put them into a basket, weighed them and brought them to our tables. My husband kept asking about the price but none was given.<br><br>At our table, he opened up another durian and asked me and another girlfriend to try it out and so we did. Again he asked whether the durian was nice and we replied that it was not bad.<br><br>He immediately started opening up another durian and said: 'See? Confirm good one, this one'.<br><br>We asked him again about the price and then came the howler. He told us the durians cost $20 a kilogram. We asked him how heavy the basket of durians was and the reply - 10kg.<br><br>We rejected the durians but the durian seller insisted that he could not take them back as the sale of this basket of five durians had already been 'keyed in' (registered).<br><br>After threatening to leave immediately, he relented and said he would return the unopened durians, but the rest (three which had already been opened) would have to be paid for.<br><br>We ended up with three durians which cost us $140.<br><br>Tey Siew Yee (Ms) Doris<br><br>________________________________________________________<br>pierre^^ thoughts:<br><br>I went to geylang eat durian b4 with my princess that time<br>Dunno same stall anot but looks like it<br>Anyway i ask the uncle how much durian cost, he say this row is kg one and one kg is 12 dollars<br>So ok, jus gimme one durian (tinking that one durian wun be so heavy)<br>U noe how much i pay?  $20 for one durian<br><br>and tell u hor, the durian is so lousy lor. Worth like 1 dollar rather than 20 dollar. Watery one, not sweet<br><br>________________________________________________________<br>my sis also went to this durian stall b4, again cant comfirm same shop but looks like it from the picture<br><br>She pick one durian and u noe hw much the man wan her to pay?<br>Cheat: $50 for one durian<br>Sis: u crazy? So expensive i dun wan to buy<br>Cheat: open liao must buy<br>Sis: Do u accept nets<br>Cheat: No<br>Sis: Den how, i not enuff money<br>Cheat how much u got<br>Sis: $10<br>Cheat: ok. Gimme $10 den<br><br>___________________________________________________________<br><br>No need go Geylang for durians actually<br>The durians at your neighbour are just as good and yummy<br>Somemore most of them sell for 3 for $10, the most expensive is maybe 3 for $20<br>But i dont like buying those in box one. Coz sometimes the pricing on them are pretty absurb, like One box $12, or $10<br>Den they will persuade u to buy and make it like the durian is heavenly<br>But often when i buy, more than often, its so so only.<br>And i know most of them mark-up the price, coz if you know how to bargain, you can actually get them for half the price<br>And durians are cheaper during closing hours<br><br>Enjoy your durians<br>Anyone miss eating orange durians? I long time no see them liao</div>
