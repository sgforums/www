              Was in HK again recently and I could help but notice the efficiency there. The transport system was great! Although packed and crowded, the MTR was seamless and fast and efficient- no breakdowns or slowdowns. Buses were very clean.  Customer service in the retail shops were quick fast polite and efficient. Many of the restuarant staff understood Cantonese and English.
              
              When I asked for directions, people on the street were intelligent enough to give me directions . No blank looks and strange accents in response to my enquiries.

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I have to agree. I stay in Hong Kong for about 2 months each year and it seems like the crowds have not prevented the seamless operation of the public transport system. The problem I think with Singapore is that unlike Hong Kong, our people don't take pride in their jobs and companies there are not just concerned about profits but about brand imaging as well. A fine example would be the immaculate conditions of the buses there. Even the oldest Dennis Dragons are in pristine condition and no visible soot can be spotted, which speaks for the apt maintenance. In Singapore, even the newer Citaros are spewing soot and getting extremely dirty on the outside. What Singapore lacks is the desire to serve and do one's job properly and with pride, of which the latter still has a long way to go. </p></div>

              <p>Cantonese dialect is a backward and useless language. Generally speaking, dialect speaking people are economically worthless, culturally backward and less developed as compared to non dialect areas.</p>
              <p>I am surprised that foreigners would want to speak cantonese in HongKong.</p>
              <p>Cantonese and other dialect speakers have no future.</p>
              <p>Look at China, all the most backward areas are the dialect speaking southern provinces like Guangdong, Fujian, Hainan and HongKong. Taiwan is also backward.</p>

Infact some of their shoe box apartments are slightly cheaper then those in Singapore! The probable reasons being that Singapore prices are rising too fast with the amount of speculative investment by foreigners  and single Singaporeans who can't qualify  for HDB.

              <p>foreigners in hong kong don't have to learn cantonese because english is common and widely used.. but many take the trouble to learn anyway</p>
              <p>i think hong kong has a much more greater identity and culture than what singapore has tried so pitifully to achieve despite that its not an independent country on its own.... there are many hong kongers as well as foreigners in hong kong who love hong kong and identify themselves proudly with hong kong</p>
              <p>hong kong has been, and will continue to be, an improtant part of china's economic development</p>

              <p>also right that at least MTR did not go around to describe itself as world class.... but overall i need to say that in terms of public transport... the subways, trains, buses, mini-bus, taxis, etc. in hong kong beats the singapore system hands down</p>
