              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; line-height: 1.3em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: -webkit-auto;"><span style="color: #333333;">It was the babas who were the framers of Singapore's rules and institutions. Many of Singapore's most prominent Chinese have had baba backgrounds. </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Lee Kuan Yew, who became prime minister of Singapore aged just 35, is the most obvious example. He claims a Hakka heritage, although his upbringing was that of a baba: </span></span></strong><span style="color: #333333;">at home, he spoke English with his parents and baba Malay to his grandparents. "Mandarin was totally alien to me and unconnected with my life," Lee said of his childhood.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; line-height: 1.3em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: -webkit-auto;"><span style="color: #333333;">For Lee, Chineseness was an acquired skill and later a political necessity. </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">He was not brought up as a Chinese with a focus on China, but as a baba who looked to England. He followed the conventional career path of a baba and went to London to study law. </span></span></strong><span style="color: #333333;">And so Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore became Harry Lee of Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge. His father had given him and two of his brothers English, as well as Chinese, names.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; line-height: 1.3em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: -webkit-auto;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> Did Lee run Singapore as a piece of Asia mired in Chinese ways? </span></span></strong></p>

              <p>AS "sons of the soil", the Straits Chinese British Association's Straits
                  Chinese defended their citizenship (or subjecthood) rights against the
                  China-born Chinese and those first-generation Singapore-born Chinese who
                  had a dual loyalty.</p>
              <p>The chasm between the Babas and the sinkehs (literally "guests", or recent
                  immigrants from China) may also be illustrated by the typical occupations
                  of the China-born Chinese which self-conscious Babas would have shunned. 
                  As S.C. Wong wrote, in a letter to The Straits Times in 1948: "Our
                  China-born brethren are very useful in Singapore. Without them, we must
                  look to automatic machinery, for few Straits-born Chinese care to take up
                  the following trades: tailor, shoe-maker, launderer, barber, farmer,
                  butcher, fisherman, grocer, market stallholder, carpenter, bricklayer,
                  painter, machine-shop artisan, boiler-maker, blacksmith, lumberjack,
                  sawmill worker, stevedore, lighterman, lorry-driver, taxi-driver, omnibus
                  driver and conductor, mining coolie, tapper, and the indispensable
                  night-soil coolie."</p>
              <p>Despite some signs of "resinicisation", <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">many Babas tended to reciprocate
                  the insults and teasing of the non-Baba Chinese by calling them "country
                  bumpkins" and low-class guests.</span></strong></p>
              <p>With the increased ambiguity of the status of the Babas, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">many of them
                  neither dared to admit they were Babas nor spoke Baba Malay in public. </span></strong></p>
              <p>The
                  days of Baba Malay as an inter-group language of commercial value were also
                  gone, and Baba Malay stagnated and became confined to the domestic domain.</p>

              dominated Singapore's population, it was the babas who dominated
              public decision-making.</span> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">In
              effect, a baba minority captured sinkeh
              Singapore</span></span></strong><span style="color: #333333;">, and
              that minority's attitudes were more those of</span>
              <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Victorian England than
              China.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">It was the babas who were
              the framers of Singapore's rules and institutions. Many of
              Singapore's most prominent Chinese have had baba
              backgrounds.</span> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Lee
              Kuan Yew, who became prime minister of Singapore aged just 35, is
              the most obvious example. He claims a Hakka heritage, although his
              upbringing was that of a baba:</span></span></strong> <span style="color: #333333;">at home, he spoke English with his parents and
              baba Malay to his grandparents. "Mandarin was totally alien to me
              and unconnected with my life," Lee said of his
              childhood.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">For Lee, Chineseness was
              an acquired skill and later a political necessity.</span>
              <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">He was not brought up as a Chinese with a focus
              on China, but as a baba who looked to England. He followed the
              conventional career path of a baba and went to London to study
              law.</span></span></strong> <span style="color: #333333;">And so
              Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore became Harry Lee of Fitzwilliam College,
              Cambridge. His father had given him and two of his brothers
              English, as well as Chinese, names.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Did Lee
              run Singapore as a piece of Asia mired in Chinese
              ways?</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">No. He
              ran it in a manner to which a British colonial administrator would
              have aspired.</span></span></strong></p>

              <p>AS "sons of the soil", the Straits Chinese British Association's
              Straits Chinese defended their citizenship (or subjecthood) rights
              against the China-born Chinese and those first-generation
              Singapore-born Chinese who had a dual loyalty.</p>
              <p>The chasm between the Babas and the sinkehs (literally "guests",
              or recent immigrants from China) may also be illustrated by the
              typical occupations of the China-born Chinese which self-conscious
              Babas would have shunned. As S.C. Wong wrote, in a letter to The
              Straits Times in 1948: "Our China-born brethren are very useful in
              Singapore. Without them, we must look to automatic machinery, for
              few Straits-born Chinese care to take up the following trades:
              tailor, shoe-maker, launderer, barber, farmer, butcher, fisherman,
              grocer, market stallholder, carpenter, bricklayer, painter,
              machine-shop artisan, boiler-maker, blacksmith, lumberjack, sawmill
              worker, stevedore, lighterman, lorry-driver, taxi-driver, omnibus
              driver and conductor, mining coolie, tapper, and the indispensable
              night-soil coolie."</p>
              <p>Despite some signs of "resinicisation", <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">many Babas tended to reciprocate the
              insults and teasing of the non-Baba Chinese by calling them
              "country bumpkins" and low-class guests.</span></strong></p>
              <p>With the increased ambiguity of the status of the Babas,
              <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">many of them
              neither dared to admit they were Babas nor spoke Baba Malay in
              public.</span></strong></p>
              <p>The days of Baba Malay as an inter-group language of commercial
              value were also gone, and Baba Malay stagnated and became confined
              to the domestic domain.</p>

              <p>They can't really complain. To the PRC government, mainland chinese are not invading hong kong. Hong Kong is part of PRC. The nett change in population is zero; there is merely a movement of people to and away from Hong Kong.</p>
