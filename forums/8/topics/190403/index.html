The 1st train that arrived was packed, so i missed it. The second time was also pack but i was very late so i was hesitating whether 2 go on or not.Just 5 sec before the door close i tried to squeeze in(I was alone) While i was stepping in and squeezing in , someone hugged me from me. It was as if the person was trying to get in to. But the way he held on to me seemed the type where boyboy hug girl girl and very tight.

I was at waiting for the train at city hall mrt at around 6+pm. The station and train were as usual packed with ppl. The 1st train that arrived was packed, so i missed it. The second time was also pack but i was very late so i was hesitating whether 2 go on or not.Just 5 sec before the door close i tried to squeeze in(I was alone) While i was stepping in and squeezing in , someone hugged me from me. It was as if the person was trying to get in to. But the way he held on to me seemed the type where boyboy hug girl girl and very tight. When everything got settled down, his hand was STILL ON MY SHOULDER affectionately  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> !! I was so stunned that the normally bad tempered me was dumbfounded! There was so many people around but they all thought i was his someone. It was only when i shrugged him that he walked away <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"> </div></blockquote>In Japan their train almost forever crowded. Thats why they have female-only carriages.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sianz. Another case of molest by bastard in this world. I am a guy personally, but what I hate most is those Ti ko Pek ( pervertic old man ) or Lao Ti Ko or any perverts and molester on the street. We humans must respect each other. Taking others advantage is a wrong wrong thing that we should never ever do. I have quite a few experience in buses and mrt also. I see those perverts not touching but their eye keep on staring at the girls breast which they wear low cut clothing. Therefore I stare at the perverts, then they pai seh and turn away looking elsewhere and pretend nothing have happen.<br><strong> TO ALL PERVERTS OUT THERE: </strong><br>IF you want to see, please go and buy some porn and watch till your eyes swollen.<br>IF you want to touch, please go Geylang and touch untill your hand rot.<br><br><strong>RESPECT THE LADIES PLEASE</strong></div>
