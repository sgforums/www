I was at waiting for the train at city hall mrt at around 6+pm. The station and train were as usual packed with ppl. The 1st train that arrived was packed, so i missed it. The second time was also pack but i was very late so i was hesitating whether 2 go on or not.Just 5 sec before the door close i tried to squeeze in(I was alone) While i was stepping in and squeezing in , someone hugged me from me. It was as if the person was trying to get in to. But the way he held on to me seemed the type where boyboy hug girl girl and very tight. When everything got settled down, his hand was STILL ON MY SHOULDER affectionately  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> !! I was so stunned that the normally bad tempered me was dumbfounded! There was so many people around but they all thought i was his someone. It was only when i shrugged him that he walked away <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"> </div></blockquote>Next time you could scream into his face, "What the eff do you think you're doing??!!" Scare him off his bloody feet. I hate these kinds of people to the core.</div>
