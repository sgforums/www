            <div class='col-md body'>Rude is perhaps not the right word to use as asking about a person's salary has got nothing to do with manner but more with curiosity. Some may called it kaypoh, but it is in everyone's nature to want to know how much people earn, especially amongst co-workers. This is where inequity can set in and comparison is inevitable. If two persons are doing more or less the same work and if their salaries are miles apart, it can cause a lot of problems.<br>Of course, if salaries are exactly the same for everyone regardless of experience, qualification, performance, merits and so forth - then it encourages people to do the barest minimum resulting in mediocre work. That's what happened in communist countries where EQUALITY is the objective. So what you get is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>equally bad</strong></span> work!<br>For people who cannot perform, has no capability, motivation and interest to work, equal pay appeals to them. Such societies remain backward.<br>On the other hand, if you have the capability and are better than the next, surely you want to be paid more! To each his own, to each his best. This is meritocracy. You want more pay, you do better than your co-workers.<br><br>Having said that, it is not difficult to estimate how much a person earns. There is such a thing called market rate, median salary, salary range and so forth. Also, variations can be expected in different companies or organisations.<br><br>At end of day, it you want to be just an employee earning a salary - then choose a line of work where special skills are required and where there is a market demand or shortage. Otherwise, be your own boss. Write your own pay cheque! And nobody can say you earn an indecent salary.</div>

You are not suppose to discuss or compare especially if working in the same company. Firstly it will stir up unhappy and dissatisfied sentiment in colleagues especially the other party gets more when that person has been working shorter period than the other one. Big companies have this rules that workers are not suppose to compare or speak out how much they earn. If they do the company has a right to terminate them.</div>
