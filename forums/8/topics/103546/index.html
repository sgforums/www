When you talk about a singer, you can talk about how you like a song or you didn't. Looks are secondary.

Frankly, he was asking about Claymates, not comments. I know you're definitely entitled to your opinions abt Clay, but imagine the immediate responses in here are so 'friendly'. I won't say everyone can forget about it like you and me. You're being frank but the words need to be politically correct.<br><br>Try using 'A feminist outlook' instead of strong words like 'sissy'. It helps.</div>
