            <div class='col-md body'>uhh.. i read the Rolling Stone review of this and they said it was as if the Titanic, Armageddon and every bad blockbuster was mashed into one...<br><br>RS has also said that the movie cheapened the history of the event, and then turned it into a tepid love story with every cliche known to man hammered in  :p<br><br>i think i'll give it a miss.. Rolling Stone has been spot on with their review of movies... go to their site and have a read.. the way the movie was slammed, it was hilarious  :p<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by yoohoo:<br><strong>Anyone watched tat movie?
