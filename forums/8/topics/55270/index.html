            <div class='col-md body'>This is for those considering OS education,<br><br>I read RMIT uni's adver today in St Times, it claimed it estb in 1894 or something.  This is not true, RMIT Uni was estb in late 1980s or early 1990s.  The 18xx date probably refer to its early namesake which was NOT a Uni - something like ITE or poly - without college/uni tutors or researchers and never functioned like a uni.<br><br>People going OS should be careful of those Uni advers, British Unis like Portsmouth, Thames Valley etc and Aussie Uni like Curtin, Canberra, South Australia etc was only TRULY established as UNIVERSITY only in 1990s or very late 1980s.   The early estb date was their namesake or historical predecessor which was NOT uni or degree awarding college, just like VITB or poly.<br><br>e.g. Curtin was only TRULY estb in 1987 but advertisement said in 1960s, which was the estb date of W A I T - Western Australia Institute of Tech, NOT even by Curtin's name but its early form which was NEVER a UNI, so WAIT's early history is quite irrelevant except to look 'old'<br><br>MOST that advertise in S'pore are really not that good unis, esp those estb in 80s/90s, there where around 40s Uni in UK and 17 in Australia in early 80s, however, there are around 100 now in UK and 40 in Australia, those that estb after 1980s are generally not that good .<br><br>UK report that many of those grad from those later estb unis are homeless - 1 in 12 of homeless are grads from those late estb unis.   Can't get jobs as employers perfer those from more estb unis</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As for UK, anyone keen can check up 'The Good Uni Guide' ranking done every year by 'The Times' newspaper (or something),<br><br>Those ranked 20 and below are all considered very good or prestigious Unis e.g. Bristol, Birmingham, Notthingham, St Andrews, LSE, Warwick etc.  (no need to mention Oxbridge lah)<br><br>u one take a closer look, many that advertise a lot and bullshit a lot in S'pore with link up with local companies to set up external degrees here in S'pore are mostly really former Polys which converted to uni and currently mostly ranked 50 to 99. e.g. Thames Valley, Lincolnshire &amp; Humberside, Sunderland,  Portsmouth, Wolverhampton, Nottingham Trent, Oxford Brookes etc.</div>

Thousands of applicants worldwide are clamouring to secure places in those esteemed varsities. This information however is probably insignificant. This is totally way out of anyone's league. Usually only a handful from the top 5 colleges in Singapore would have a calibre of such to gain entry into their hallowed halls.<br><br>I have never ever given a second look to those universities that resort to placing ads newspapers. Specifically those unheard ones that Rob has mentioned. Why literally pay buckets for a worthless paper from an unrecognised institution? That money would be put to better use in the form of investments.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Solidsnake,<br><br>maybe i misunderstand you <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> , I don't think 'unheard of' means unrecongised.   this is 2 concepts.  Many pp heard of Yale, Princeton and Chicago, Dartmouth is less heard of, however all are very prestigious Unis and all are recognised worldwide<br><br>Similarly, for Australia/British uni, Of course Oxbridge is the best and most heard of but others like Bristol, Warwick are also very good.  U of Western Australia and U of Adelaide don't advertise so much so they are not so POPUlar as Monash or UNSW but they are all Group of 8 /sandstone unis and ranked very similarly if not higher in terms of research, teaching and other measures.<br><br>Moreover, if u produce famous old boys/gals, like UWA or Adelaide, it sure boost your 'word of mouth' reputation.<br><br>Many Aust/Brit are WELL hear of just due to Advertising e.g. Portsmouth, Curtin, RMIT etc and also have lots and lots of external degree grads, it does not mean that they are the best in Aust, it only mean they take in lots and lots of students - maybe and likely at expense of standards, requirements and rigor</div>
