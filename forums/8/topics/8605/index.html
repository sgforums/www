            <div class='col-md body'>Well, as we all know, lots of people r flooding to the south to Aussie for education. But do u think its really that good? Just imagine coming back in fours yrs time, and u discovered that your neighbours got a aussie cert, the guy next block has a aussie cert, and the girl downstairs got one too. Wouldnt it be so "common" to own a aussie cert nowadays? And with top government agents slamming sporeans going aussie as "cannot make the mark so they go aussie" comment, do u still think its worth it to study there anymore?<br>Personally, i would rather go US, UK or Canada to study. They have more fundings (in terms of research)compared to Aussie. Much more cosmopolitian (much international). And much more top researchers and companies that are willing to employ u. There are lots of reasons that going to the North (US, UK, Canada) is better to the South (Aust).<br>Wanna share your thoughs on this peeps?<br>Anyway i will be going to Canada to study next May. Anyone going there around that time too?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"cannot make the mark so they go aussie" ?<br><br>Is this some discrepancy in our education system? First of all, statitics will show that a great majority of Poly graduates went ahead to obtain a degree. Most will not make it to our two local universities due to the simple fact that there's limited vacancies, most of which is reserved for A level students, and a good portion to foreign students who would have signed a bond with our country.<br><br>Most poly students will not be admitted into one of our 2 local universities, not even if their grades in poly indicates their competency in their field.<br><br>There are no alternatives. One will have to venture overseas to pursue his degree. Now, after venturing overseas, many found sanctuary in foreign lands and never return, afterall not everyone is game for fast pace rat race in Singapore.<br><br>This isn't a problem of competency or students not being able to meet their mark. Its a problem of supply and demand. And demand clearly outweights its supply.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A degree is just a key to open doors. It is not an important factor in determining success in your career.

            <div class='col-md body'>Whatever people say about studying in Australia..you've gotta admit you gain certain things you would not gain in the local Universities. Like a different culture, a new outlook of life , independence , friends you wouldn't dream of meeting back home etc .<br>As for prestigue , such things have little value as the purpose of a degree for most is to get a job. A degree is just a key to open oppurtunities , whatever you achieve after that is how much you put into your job.<br>All you need to care is to make sure that your degree is recognized back home.</div>

Well, the seasons are good for fashion freaks, because you get to sport different styles of clothes to fit the season. Singapore for me is full-time shorts and t-shirt. Yeah, I'll probably go down to St. Kilda and Yarra River, when the whether warms.
