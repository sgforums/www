            <div class='col-md body'>according to a survey(dunno if any of u remember this one), they say that it is wise to have gone thru on an average at least 13 relationships before you have the right frame of mind, as well as the experience and psychological maturity to make the right choice. i think that when i say relationship does not mean exactly the same thing as bf, but really close, so &gt;shrug&lt; who knows if this is true?<br><br>either way, i think that angel-baby, the choice is ultimately yours and i think you gotta see what the situation is like. However, maybe 17 is a litttle too early to decide who you wanna spend the rest of your life with(if that is what settling down means)... Perhaps in a part of your mind you should start thinking for the unseen situation whereby you might possibly meet someone new and better? Coz realistically speaking, this CAN come true.</div>
