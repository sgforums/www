              <p>Ok i got reminded on this situation after hearing about Chew Chor Meng strickened with muscular dystrophy.</p>
              <div class="content">i was in thailand for holiday few months ago with my family.<br><br>One evening, i, my sister n my mum were at the mall's supermarket looking at some foodstuffs...coz we wanna buy some snacks to eat back at the hotel, or bring back to singapore<br><br>we were at the cold food section, as we walked, i saw a handicapped man on a motorised wheelchair, next to the milks/fruit juices shelves. i saw him struggling to get a carton of juice, n i notice his hands were skinny n weak. he was trying to grab n lift up the carton but failed to do so.<br><br>he probably had some muscular degeneration disease, thats probably why his hands r weak n have difficulty getting the carton. And perhaps the 1 litre carton was rather heavy for him to lift up with his feeble limbs. There weren't many people around in that section of the supermarket at that time.<br><br>i thought of approaching him and offer a helping hand. But then i decided to ignore it, as i didn't really know how to speak thai, except for a handful of short phrases.<br><br>so i just walked on, trying my best not to look in his direction. My mum n sis didn't see that handicap man struggling, n i didnt tell them also.<br><br>Before we left that area, i turned back for a last look, n he is still helplessly struggling to grab n lift up the carton. anyway i hoped some kind soul did walked pass n helped him....<br><br>Now, looking back, i kinda regretted not helping him. If it werent for the language barrier, i would have helped. If this happen in singapore, i would probably go forward to lend a helping hand.<br><br>I really feel guilty, n i hope God forgives me. Was it wrong of what i have done? How can i repent my sin? Do some volunteer work? Or donate some money?</div>

              <p><br>cuz some of them have super strong ego &amp; self-esteem..hence..do not wish for help from others..</p>

              <p>most probably she feel offended that u rendered help..</p>
              <p>that's why sometimes really don't know if one should help out anot..</p>

              <p>there's this time whereby i boarded a super crowded bus..bt luckily..i managed to get a seat..an old fragile man got up the bus &amp; stood beside me..hence..i got up &amp; let him have the seat..i wasn't expecting him to express his gratitude or what..but what he did really shocked me! he actually raised his voice &amp; said in a loud voice that who do I think I am &amp; what do i treat him as? Did he said that he needed that seat?</p>

              <p>there's some who confessed that at the intial stage right..they felt very demoralized..like become åºŸäºº &amp; hence detest anyone who offered to help them..they just want to feel "normal"..that they can do normal stuff w/o any help..(i am not saying that this mentality applies to all)</p>
