            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Just like to know opinions from people whether they believe that people of different sexes can be really really good friends?<br><br>From the friends around me, i realised that girls actually believe that it is possible while guys don't think so. Guys who are on very good terms with a certain girl are usually:<br>1) Hoping that the girls will be their gf but  still waiting for the chance to ask the girl.<br>2) If the girl already has a bf, they are willing to be the spare tyre and in hope that they will break up.<br><br>What do you people think?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yah, i definitely believe in platonic friendship.  having friends of another gender  helps me to better understand guys.  i do have a few good friends who are guys, and there is really zero possiblity of any of them changing their status to being my bf. we chat about so many things, and regularly bemoan our luck or share our ectascy (not the drug!) about the other gender.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>there are couples, i guess, who started out as very goodfriends.  anyway, the basis of a good relationship should be a solid friendship.  probably that explains it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think it's possible. I have a few good lady freinds. Whenever we have group gathering, we talk about everything under the sun, yes including certain taboo subjects.<br><br>But as you grow older, it's more and more difficult to find such friends.<br><br>I think that a person who is desperate for love - not only guys, will hope that they will one day have more than just friendship. I had seen such experience myself and the worst part is I can't do much to help coz' both parties are my friends.<br><br>For me, I guess that I would not want to risk friendship for something that is uncertain, unless I know for sure that the girl also like me. I believe when the times come, you'll get your guy or girl. So, don't panic.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well paltonic..hmm i believe that it is possible to have a close relationship with a gal and not be committed but it will hurt at times.<br><br>But does platonic mean no physical closeness. I find it very dificult to keep the physical aspect out of the platonic friendship.<br><br>But to be close to a gal wishing that eventually she'll want u as a b/f does not qualify as having a platonic friendship.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm, I don't really believe that it's possible. First of all, most times when a guy and girl become close friends, it's something that they share deep down inside that doesn't have to be spoken...They share smae feelings and etc...hence their closeness...To me, this is the ultimate kind of respect that mature relationships are based on.  I beleieve that this closeness of being was meant by nature for us to build on to a more complete and satisfying relationship.  Just think about it.  If u share feelings, tears, heart aches, problems, happiness, emotions, food, water, etc...etc...then this is what u are looking for in ur life.  It is exactly this perfection that women are looking for from men.  It is exactly what men are looking for . Ultimately it is exactly what both sexes see as the perfect person to be with....i believe that we have been bred to believe that it isn't possible or shouldn't be so that friends can be GF/BF, husband/wife.<br><br>Who says?  Again, it is a case of everything being intellectualised and logic gets in the way of what's staring u in the face.  how many times have both women and men said that this is the right one for me, but friends cannot because we are different in this and that....:-p  I know I've said it, and I know that I've said that my close Gal friends are the types I would want to marry ort have as a GF, and many times many of those same Gal friends have said the same to me, but it never happens because we put stop signs everywhere there is an open road.<br><br>Shouldn't that person that we can connect to so well be the ones?  Maybe I'm too idealistic here, but I think that it should be like this.  If women really want to have a purely platonic friendship with males, they go and make friends with gay guys...and they love that they can get insight from such guys without the hassle of feelings getting involved or there being complications...but u know what...I know of a few cases of these same gay guys falling for these close gal friends because they are smart enough to realise..."here is the one for me.  here is someone I can relate to.  Here is the one that I can be myslef totally and have her love me just the same.  Here is the one that knows me to my soul and loves me unconditionally..."<br><br>Why not?  WE connect with people for a reason.  Singaporeans have this big brother and sister thing where u call each other...my brother or my sworn sister and such...Right people?  From what I notice, a majority of times, these little mini-relationships come about from an attraction to that other person...for whatever reason...Something u feel for them and something they feel for u.  And somehow u love them, and somehow they love u...but somehow you have put up road blocks to make sure that it doesn't get anywhere...so u come up with a strategy whereby u can be jsut as close wiothout the fear of hassles and problems so that u know that u will never lose them...It could be attributed to fear even....of failing and losing...I know that I have a few Sisters here in Singapore...Although I don't contact them anymore, I still feel for them.  and i remember when we first made it official that we were brother and sister(if it ws up to me I would just make us GF/BF... I am one of those lucky ones who know what I feel and not be confused by it), I always felt that there was some deep attractiion that we didn't know how to voice or bring into physical shape...and so it remains unsaid and platonic...and I know without them ever saying it...that they felt the same way...It's when two people can connect emotionally and spiritually... U love the person, what more is there to it....It is the most pure and uncomplicated of all love...The complications come in when we start to think about it.  When we start to rationallise it.  When we start to add our own filter to the situation.<br><br>My point:  Most people will never break away from their ways of thinking or the filters that they put everything thru before making decisions, so we complicate things that are so pure and uncomplicated....I have always felt that it was so simple...We connect on levels that we can never connect with anyone else....We would be good together...Why not...<br>Exactly that...Why not?  Please ask urselves that question...and u will find that most of ur answers are purely logical/rational ones and have nothing to do with how u really feel about ur relationship with that person...<br><br>So all in all, it is quite impossible fro guys and girls to be platonic....Somewhere along the way, someone will attain enlightenment (reach Zen, and start to feel without complicating it with human fallacies)and realise that it feels right.  It always does...but sometimes, the person can keep it secret becasue of fear.....<br><br>I don't think that I am wrong, but please comment anyway.<br><br>P.S.-Of course if really u don't like the person and feel nothing for them, don't go and try to force it...:-)<br><br>Just another note....the feelings i have for a girl who I am close to but"platonic" is almost always stronger, more meaningful and my love for them is usually stronger and more true than for some of my GF....<br><br>Go figure...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I have to disagree with you on the part about platonic relationship (for argument sake) eventhough u're better than USB.<br><br>The point is that have you ever wonder why some things are meant to be that way? Not every close friend you have are to be the ONE. Let me try and put it another way (I know sometimes I can't express myself properly, but I'll try my best).<br><br>To have a successful relationship, it takes faith and commitment, if either party lacks one of these components, it's not gonna last long. The reasons why some people would prefer platonic relationship over BGR are as follow:<br><br>Firstly, they are not ready for serious relationship. Not because they are immature, but because they are mature enough to realise that it is not times yet or perhaps they are not ready to commit and do not wish to hurt the other party. Perhaps both party do not want to be tied down at the moment because they have some other commitment and realise they cannot juggle two things at a time (in my case).<br><br>Secondly, the person might prefer the freedom that comes along with platonic relationship, so don't want something more.<br><br>Thirdly, why can't two person of opposite sex be just friends? Why must it lead to something more? Sometimes it's not that we put barriers all over to protect ourselves but to preserve the friendship. We take calculated risk in that we don't go for every close friend. Even you don't do that  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>And about love being simple, yes, I agree. And if one party should realise that the other party is his/her soulmate, then it was already meant to be in the first place. Just remember that not every friendship is like that.<br><br>If you don't like the person, you wouldn't be close to him/her in the first place.<br><br>About the brother/sister thingy, I would not say it's the same as platonic. It's another kind of relationship that can develop into something more, but not necessary so. Might be something superficial or a disguise though, like you said, someone hoping for something more.<br><br>The kind of love you feel for your close friends are easily confused with the BGR kind of love. Sometimes, the feeling can be more intense than that of BGR and that's when you realise that the one you're with rite now is not the ONE but your close friend is. This kind of problem would be quite sticky and personally, I wouldn't know how to get out of this one.<br><br>By the way, you might think that I'm contradicting myself somewhere along the line, but what I'm trying to say is that, it is possible to have a platonic relationship  without going further. Not brother/sister though, to me, there's always somthing fishy about it, it's like a childish kind of relationship.<br><br>Maybe difficult since we always get confused about our feelings, but not impossible altogether to stay the same.</div>
