            <div class='col-md body'>This month, my agent at Ken Brothers Reliant Air Travel call me and said they got special offer on a five-day-three-night holiday to New York, I want to go or not? Some more got free tour bag.<br><br>I said, go New York do what? No casino, no karaoke, where got fun.<br><br>He said, there got a lot of museum. I say, see old thing where got fun? I want to see old thing, I just ask my husband to tng-kor.<br><br>He said, there got Broadway - a lot of musical one. I say, fly so long go and see for what? Some more, buy one ticket can buy five big five small. You ask me, might as well go and buy five big, five small.<br><br>He say there the shopping quite tok kong. All the designer label all got.<br><br>I say Batam, Haadyai, even KL got designer label, some more cheaper also. And also locally-made. (We must support local industries, mah.)<br><br>Then he say, there got world's largest factory outlet. I say, "Like that, means on lah!"<br><br>So I and my nephew fly into New York. (Got nephew can carry things when go shopping.)<br><br>First thing they tell us is, be careful of muggers. They rob people one.<br><br>So I immediately go and slap my nephew. All this time he told me he was mugging, I thought he was studying. The si nung kia was robbing people!<br><br>So we took the tour bus, go and see Empire State Building. I demanded my money back because got no King Kong there. I go up so far to see other buildings for what? I see building before. At least I never see giant gorilla before. Waste time.<br><br>We also go and see the World Trade Centre. Again waste time. Singapore also got World Trade Centre. Some more ours got bridal and home furnishing fair.<br><br>We also go and see the Statue of Liberty. Wah lau eh, I tell you, the queue to go up to the crown si beh long. Almost as long as I queue up to buy 4D every Saturday.<br><br>I see oreddy, got idea - why not set up a 4D booth in the crown of the Statue of Liberty? In fact, why not set up 4D booths in every single tourist attraction? Like that, sure attract more people.<br><br>They also say, hor, New York got a lot of famous people. Got one afternoon, while we walking that time, hor, my nephew pull my sleeve and shout, "Meh-donna! Meh-donna!" I look, and only got this a bit bogay, a bit slutty-looking ang-mor char bor.<br><br>So I slap the si nung kia again.<br><br>"You stupid or what? Meh-donna is not a char bor! Make me kan cheong only, I thought can go Meh-donna and buy Hello Kitty. My heart jump for nothing!"<br><br>I ask you, nowsaday what they tich chewrens in school?<br><br>Next day we took bus and go Woodbury Common, the world's largest factory outlet.<br><br>Wah lau eh, I tell you hor, is exactly like Disneyland like that, except got no rides. And no Mickey Mouse. And no Goofy also.<br><br>One whole village got nothing but these designer shops, all discount many percent. But you ask me, hor, I say they still not as cheap as Haadyai designer shops.<br><br>Some more, they cheat people one. Because they all call themselves factory outlet, but I look and look and look, got no factory one! Anyhow call!<br><br>All in all, New York is quite can, lah. Bit expensive, a bit cheat people.<br><br>And it's true, New York got a lot of black people, but they all quite can, one.<br><br>Because they all can speak a bit of Hokkien.<br><br>I saw this black man dancing, and he kept calling everyone, "Yo! Yo!" The Ah Beng downstair in my void deck also like that - dance and shout, "Yo-ah yo, yo-ah yo." So acherly they quite the same.<br><br>I think overall Singapore better lah, because New York Meh-donna don't have Hello Kitty one, you know.<br><br>from <a href="http://www.talkingcock.com" rel="nofollow">www.talkingcock.com</a></div>
