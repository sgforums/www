But besides Durai, a number of people are also involved, only that their names aren't being mentioned as much as him. Afterall, he is the CEO. There's a Chinese saying:<br>"shang liang bu zheng xia liang wai". With the majority of Singaporeans being Chinese, they look to him to lead, not to mislead. Since NKF got into such a mess, obviously all fingers will point to him. Remember, he is the leader. Not others.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Durai's answers to the KPMG report<br><br>But auditing firm calls former NKF CEO's expenditure, salary justification 'disingenuous'<br><br>After being pilloried in the press and slammed by the KPMG report, former NKF chief executive T T Durai gave a point-by-point rebuttal to the various issues raised about him.<br><br>Refuting the report's conclusion that he had actually "received much more while appearing to accept less (pay and bonuses)" through the use of backdated salary increments, Mr Durai's lawyers highlighted several factors that should be taken into account, such as Mr Durai's $210,000 annual income in 1982 as a law firm partner, his 22 years of unpaid volunteer work since 1971 and his rejection of the Executive Committee's (Exco) various proposals to increase his salary.<br><br>According to his lawyers' calculations, Mr Durai had in fact foregone $1.18 million in salary increments since he became chief executive officer in 1992 Â— "less than he would have if he had accepted the offer even after taking into account retrospective increment and bonuses".<br><br>The reply added was that "all of Mr Durai's salary increases were discussed and approved by the Exco".<br><br>However, KPMG pointed out that the former board had delegated all its powers to the Exco, which in turn delegated most of them to Mr Durai. This appeared to breach the National Council of Social Service (NCSS) Code of Governance and Management for Voluntary Welfare Organisations, said the report.<br><br>Mr Durai responded that as Exco members and specialised sub-committee members, the board members were "always involved in decision-making, acting together with others who had special skills and an appreciation of the mission and programmes of the NKF".<br><br>This logic was put down by KPMG as "overly-generalised and disingenuous".<br><br>In a defence of former director Matilda Chua's high exit payout package when she resigned in 2000, Mr Durai said she was instrumental to the success of the NKF's charity show that year, and that she had deferred her resignation tendered in January 2000 to run the charity show.<br><br>"The June 2000 show was a success and raised $7 million gross. It was the practice of the NKF in previous years to pay a performance bonus to staff involved in organising and running a successful charity show. In accordance with this practice, the NKF paid Matilda a six-month performance bonus (worth $75,000) in July 2000," he said.<br><br>As for what has become known as the "elastic patient numbers", Mr Durai said his knowledge of these numbers was "entirely dependent on the information supplied by the Department of Patient Advancement".<br><br>But even as internal requests were made for consistent patient figures, KPMG uncovered in an email trail that "(Mr Durai) says to stick with 2,000 patients".<br><br>Was a study trip to Las Vegas by a team of nine Â— including Mr Durai Â— to get ideas for the NKF's charity show warranted?<br><br>Mr Durai said public feedback implied the 10-year old show model was "becoming somewhat stale". Ideas from the trip resulted in "a fresh new concept" for April 2004's charity show and the NKF Cancer Show in July, which raised $26 million Â— as compared to the $70,000 invested in the trip, he said.<br><br>Responding to botched contracts with Forte Systems and Protonweb Â— worth a total $7.5 million Â— in the NKF's acquisition of new technology, Mr Durai outsourced lapses in judgment to the deputy head of the technology department, Mr Jayaraman.<br><br>He also disagreed with KPMG's conclusion that he had authorised payment of US$320,000 ($532,400) to Forte Systems, relegating the judgement call to the Technology Evaluation Committee under Mr Alwyn Lim, vice-chairman of the NKF.<br><br>Mr Durai denied knowledge of his role in the NKF's employment of Forte System's staff and the NKF's application for training visit passes for two such staff. He said that the signature imprinted on their covering letters were from a rubber stamp.<br><br>While confirming that Mr Pharis Aboobacker was his close friend, Mr Durai said that he was not involved in the negotiations of the Forte Software Agreement and the Protonweb BPO agreement. Both firms were owned by Mr Aboobacker.<br><br>http://www.todayonline.com/articles/91213.asp</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by dragg:</div><div class="quote_body">the easiest way is to put all the blame on durai.<br><br>something fishy?</div></blockquote>I know.... the old executive committee themselves are about as much as to blame as Durai himself. Durai has a lot to answer for, but so does the old executive committee.<br><br>In the first place, they themselves had delegated most of their powers to Durai. NKF pretty much became a one-man show after that. Why is this the case? At the very least, this appears to be a shirking of responsibilities on the part of the exco. The KPMG auditors themselves said that this move seems to breach the NCSS Code of Governance and Management for Voluntary Welfare Organisations.<br><br>I guess it's up to the NCSS to decide if that's really the case.<br></div>
