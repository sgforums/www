Durai is just the frontman, the "Real Power" is at the top advising and backing Durai and NKF. The one who said Durai pay is peanut is the "Real Power" which can influence(good or bad) NKF. There is also the "Power Source" which is more deadly. No one in Singapore can touch or question the "Power Source" lor. It is like the Emperor of Singapore.  Thats why all the while smart people will not question or touch NKF, and just leave it alone.
