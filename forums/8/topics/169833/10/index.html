            <div class='col-md body'>for our neighbour above us, i am not sure it contradict any islam law by fund raising for worthy cause on national TV and donate by call or sms.<br><br>Many projects like construction or development, you have to $take care$ of many people.  Everyone makes sure they $take care$ of someone or being $taken care$ by someone.  In PRC and india also same.  In the old days, our lion city also like that although only a few level at the bottom and the very top few.<br><br>i Just cannot imagine how much fund need to be raise just to $take care$ of so many levels from top to bottom so as to get enough to really take care of the cause.  i also want to be $taken care$.  Its common and encourage to do so.<br><br>You can see the only few NKF details release now and even worst previuosly , no details release.  I think someone did question the health ministry on more deatils, the reply says its confidential and up to the NKF to decide.</div>
