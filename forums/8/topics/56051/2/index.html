            <div class='col-md body'>Asian Travel Club called me again, today!!!!!<br><br>The girl told me to go to the office tomorrow to collect my "gifts".<br>She claimed to be the coordinator for free gifts.<br>As I have been busy these days, I will not have the time to "entertain" them.  So I told her that I'm not going to her office.<br><br>She raised her voice and said "WHY NOT?!?!?!!?"<br>I responded "Huh what?"  (I was wondering why on earth she needs to raise her voice.  To threaten me ah?  I'm afraid it doesn't work..hehe).<br>She said "Why are you not coming down?"<br>I told her that I don't want the gift anymore.<br>Again, she raised her voice "WHY NOT!?!??!?!"   She seems to have limited vocab....hahha.<br>I said to her "Because I don't want it!"<br>Then she said "Ok lor."<br>I bet, in two to three months' time, they are going to call me again.<br><br>Sigh, I did not expect to receive the call.  So I was not mentally prepared.  Otherwise, I will take down her name, her phone number and post it here in the forum.  So that you all can call her up and ask her for the "free gift" since I told her that I am not interested and that she can give it away to someone else.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Honeybunz:</div><div class="quote_body">ha!<br><br>A lady called me, said that I won a lucky draw, which I entered at some shopping mall.  She told me to go town to 230 Orchard Rd #08-234 Faber Hse to collect it.  She was very persistent that I went down at the arranged time on the following day.<br><br>Someone told me that this is some kind of time sharing thingy (what the hell is time sharing???) and that they will push me to invest or buy something really really expensive (exactly what I thought).  The next day, while I was at work, the lady called to re-confirm the appointment.  And I said I need to work.  No time to go down at all.  At the same time, I asked her how long it will take to collect the prize.  She said about 90 minutes cuz they need to process the hotel voucher for me.  I told her that 90 minutes is too long and that I was very busy.  She was very pushy and die die must arrange a time for me.  So I told her to give my "lucky draw prize" to someone else then.<br><br>In the afternoon, the lady called again and said "Did you turn up for the 11.30 am appt this morning?"  Then again she tried to fix an appointment for me.  This time, very annoyed with the way she tried her luck, I in turn pushed her to give me the lucky draw prize first.  She said "no no no.  We need some time for you, cuz we have so many destinations for you to choose".  I said to her "Why don't I tell you my desired destination now and you process my hotel voucher.  Then I come and pick it up."  She said that this could not be done as they are having a Travel Fair that she wanted me to attend.  "Well, I just want my prize since you said that I won a lucky draw.  Why not I drop by and just pick up the prize?"  Then she said no, cannot be done.  This time, it was my turn to be persistent.  I pushed her to give me the prize since she claimed that I won something.<br><br>Then she realised that she could not push her luck any further, she got pissed off and told me that she would get her manager to call me.<br><br>Guys and gals,<br>what do you think I should do next?  I know I can ignore them.  But since they want to con me to go down and then con me to buy something that might costs $5000 to $10000 (that's what I heard from my father who went down once, but didn't buy anything), I want to con them, force them or whatever you call that, to give me the prize - free hotel voucher and a digital camera.<br><br>If I ever go down, I will leave my credit cards and ATM cards at home.  Just bring $50 and my IC.  (That's what I did when I visited those expensive &amp; pushy beauty saloon that always hard sell their super expensive products.)<br><br>What do you think??</div></blockquote>well, if i were you, i go cos no harm trying..</div>
