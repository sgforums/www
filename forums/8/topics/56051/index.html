            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>ha!<br><br>A lady called me, said that I won a lucky draw, which I entered at some shopping mall.  She told me to go town to 230 Orchard Rd #08-234 Faber Hse to collect it.  She was very persistent that I went down at the arranged time on the following day.<br><br>Someone told me that this is some kind of time sharing thingy (what the hell is time sharing???) and that they will push me to invest or buy something really really expensive (exactly what I thought).  The next day, while I was at work, the lady called to re-confirm the appointment.  And I said I need to work.  No time to go down at all.  At the same time, I asked her how long it will take to collect the prize.  She said about 90 minutes cuz they need to process the hotel voucher for me.  I told her that 90 minutes is too long and that I was very busy.  She was very pushy and die die must arrange a time for me.  So I told her to give my "lucky draw prize" to someone else then.<br><br>In the afternoon, the lady called again and said "Did you turn up for the 11.30 am appt this morning?"  Then again she tried to fix an appointment for me.  This time, very annoyed with the way she tried her luck, I in turn pushed her to give me the lucky draw prize first.  She said "no no no.  We need some time for you, cuz we have so many destinations for you to choose".  I said to her "Why don't I tell you my desired destination now and you process my hotel voucher.  Then I come and pick it up."  She said that this could not be done as they are having a Travel Fair that she wanted me to attend.  "Well, I just want my prize since you said that I won a lucky draw.  Why not I drop by and just pick up the prize?"  Then she said no, cannot be done.  This time, it was my turn to be persistent.  I pushed her to give me the prize since she claimed that I won something.<br><br>Then she realised that she could not push her luck any further, she got pissed off and told me that she would get her manager to call me.<br><br>Guys and gals,<br>what do you think I should do next?  I know I can ignore them.  But since they want to con me to go down and then con me to buy something that might costs $5000 to $10000 (that's what I heard from my father who went down once, but didn't buy anything), I want to con them, force them or whatever you call that, to give me the prize - free hotel voucher and a digital camera.<br><br>If I ever go down, I will leave my credit cards and ATM cards at home.  Just bring $50 and my IC.  (That's what I did when I visited those expensive &amp; pushy beauty saloon that always hard sell their super expensive products.)<br><br>What do you think??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah... this is a time sharing thing. has happen to me b4 also. many times in fact. usually i just simple ignore their calls. coz they call me on my hp. just tell them off that i am not interested and ignore watever phone calls they call.  Bascially u will be assign a sales person and they will do one to one hard sell tactics on you..trying to make u sign up their time sharing packages. and u have to sit thru the 90mins then u can get your so call prizes. if i were u ..i wouldnt even bother to go down at all. the so call lucky draw its just part of their tactics... to con people to go down. and why 90 mins? coz people will get tired after such and long time and to stop the sales person from going on and going...some people are pressurized and will just sign for the package so they can go home.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>I attended one of the time-share presentations before At Tanjong Pagar many years back, sat thru 90 min with them. (At that time I was very free mah, school hols, nothing to do and they said I can get 30 rolls of Konica films free as long as I attend the presentation. No purchase required.) At the end of the presentation, they try to hard sell me to sign up for the time-share thingy, refuse to let me leave the shop. So I stayed loh, drank their packet drinks and look through their color brochures. The salesperson keep talking to me to take up time-share.<br><br>I said i wanna look through the brochures first, so he gave me time. I finished quiet a few packets of drinks leow. Satisfied, I got up approach the saleperson that I'm still schooling, no money to buy any of the time-share. They ask what about my family members even though I go alone. I said I gotta go back and ask them and then I request for my films. The salesperson was quite upset as cannot do anything to me and I'm finishing their packet drinks meant for other victims.<br><br>Guess what? They gave me a voucher to collect the films at another place and the voucher got T&amp;Cs that  I must purchase some equipment like camera before I can get the films. I took the voucher and they finally let me go coz I told them I don't have money and I can't buy anything. (I left my ATM cards at home, only $2 and MRT with me, nothing else)<br><br>Altho i kana conned of the films but at least I drank a lot of packet drinks, watch beautiful pictures of other countries and enjoyed myself thoroughly. So still worth it! Hehehe....<br><br>By the way, I'm one of the most calculative, fussy and small-things-can-create-until-big-issue type of customer when I feel like it. Any store that I patronize has to beware of me... hehehe.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
