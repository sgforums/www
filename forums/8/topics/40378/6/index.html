            <div class='col-md body'>May i please have a say in this. Although i am not gay, i think very much they should never<br>be discriminated. Before i continue, please allow me to clear all your doubts about what a gays.<br><br>If one day you see two males kissing or huggin (definitely not so passionately in public. At home is ok)<br>Then what you just saw are not gays but are 2 males who love each other and want each other to<br>know that They will be there for each other, should either of them fall in to trouble or<br>do something wrongly in life (This msg is infered by each male through the kissing and<br>hugging). They may like each others body TEXTURE ie. Smooth, free of pimples. Whats more<br>important, is that they stick close to each other and trust each other in life and they do not<br>become unfaithful to each other. The max they ever go, is to sleep with each other on the same<br>bed(This is nothing wrong.Don't we do this in camps?). Any way, no sex is involved.. however, as they trust each other<br>they feel free to do anything unharmful, such as taking off all of his clothes even when the other person is looking.<br>REMEMBER: THe other guy should not get hot over this issue of looking.<br><br>However, the correct concept of a gay is when a boy looks at another boy and he likes the body texture or<br>the muscles and dream of touching them and gets excited over touching them or like gets really hot(immediately)<br>when he meets the guy. One obvious way to see, is that he gets excited over almost every male he sees.<br>And he and the other guys starts having sex (I mean anal sex). When either one takes of his clothes totally, the other gets really<br>excited.. cos it means. their going to have sex. Then, what you've seen are 2 gays.<br><br>I think, we should never discriminate them. People get married with the main reason that they<br>want someone by their sides when either sides need help. (If they get married bcos of the reason<br>of sex, then it's wrong.) So if two males find themselves able to help each other up in times of distress<br>and to help each other up should either of them get in to trouble, then there is perfectly nothing wrong.<br>Some boys just don't think girls can help as much due to their weakness, strengh and emotions.<br>So when you see a male huggin another male out there, please get your facts right.. You can't just<br>single them out as gays.<br><br>nismoS132 Once commented in this forum, that gays, transvestites, butches, lesbos, i find them disgusting, i can't help it, it's in my nature to detest things that go against nature - 03 April 2003<br>But please sdo understand that not every thing on earth goes the way you want things to.. We all have to compromise. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>
