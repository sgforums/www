That doesn't make us any different from them.  The message that we should drive aross is that homosexuals are really no different from us, and that discrimination of any form should not be practised.  Tolerance and respect is called for here.  Homosexual discriminaiton is no different from racism.  Aye?<br><br>Hiya kukujiao,<br><br>What have homosexuals done to make you view them in that light?  Have they hurt you?  Di they impose their homosexual ways on you directly?  If not, why then are we treating them in such a different light?  Honestly, what have they done to make us discriminate against them?  No one who claims to have a hatred or dislike for them could really give a good reason other than 'I just do'.<br><br>Bring it on!!</div></blockquote>are u gay?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
