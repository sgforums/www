            <div class='col-md body'>Ahem, I hope i do not have to remind all forumites that insults targetting at certain individual is not tolerated here, esp certain forumites who claimed that they have been around for a very long time, yet they r the ones who violated the rules and policy in this forum.<br><br>And this is directed to a certain forumite that "its disgusting and i feel disgusted regarding anything that is against nature".<br>Let me ask u, what is natural? In the wild, some animals practise homosexual activities, is that un-natural? It is well documented in alot of journals and literature.<br><br>On top of that, being homosexual is nothing against nature. It has been proven that homosexuals r destined at birth. Not due to "choices" they make in life. In layman terms, they r born to be gays or lesbians. Just like u r born being a male or female, being deaf or dumb or being mentally disabled. So if this is against nature, aint we ALL against nature all the time by doing un-natural things? Almost everything in life that we use, consume etc r artificially made.<br>IVF - in vitro fertilization, is that against nature?<br>Dying our hair - against natural colours?<br>Doing manicure? Wearing clothes?? Cooking our food?<br>So what exactly is natural?<br><br>To all gay and lesbian bashers, I felt sorrow for you people for having such narrow minds and yet u proclaim that u r modern and open minded.<br>We live in a civilised world yet u behave otherwise.<br><br>I felt sorrow for u people for not opening up your eyes, mind and heart to see the world but chose to be binded up in ya protective womb, unwilling to be expelled into this harsh real world.<br><br>On the side line, alot of these "un-natural" people r more good looking than u r, more well-mannered, more fun to be with, dress well, live well and have more desirable qualities that u will never have.<br><br>So open up, see the world, be more tolerant. Dont rapidly open your gap and spew words u dont even understand without going thru your brain.<br><br>Cheers!<br><br></div>

We tend to have so many laws that the majority of people don't even know what laws are around.<br><br>With regards to the laws towards 'un-natural sex', we only apply it to homosexuals (males) when we heteorsexuals are also indulging in it.  Weird, right?  And note, jay walking is a very public act.  We do know that sex is a more private thing.  So unless sexual abuse is at hand, aren't laws towards sex between 2 consenting adults a wee bit iffy today?<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>

I do not really think it makes any sense for u to shoot your gap off when you're being an ineffective moderator. 8 pages before you stepped in.

I think he was wondering why no moderators were intervening in the personal derogatory statements made towards him (and me) for posting our views, neutral views if I may say so.  I mean, you came thankfully, but a wee bit late, I guess.  But at least the attacks have stopped.<br><br>Bring it on!!</div></blockquote>thanks but i do not need any moderator intervention. if he was gonna jump in, he should have done so at the begining. Not wait 8 pages before saying...oh..shouldn't you people play nice.</div>
