Never was known to gamble a lot before that. Mother dotes on him and gives him $$ when he asked for more. That is the profile I know about him.</div>

Know how to study very well doesn't mean u can manage a business well. As in business, primarily we r dealing with human basically, the hardest thing to manage i muz say.</div>
