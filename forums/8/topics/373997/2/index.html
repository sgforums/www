              <p>11-12 wakeup at 7 isn't that many hrs right? Anyway its 1am now and you got school tml i assume.</p>
              <p>When i say sleep problems, it means problems during sleep. Its not that you will wakeup etc but more your sleep being interrupted while you are sleeping... Sounds abit confusing but sleep apnea is a problem with breathing or something and it causes you to choke or be unable to breath for a few seconds or something like that during sleep. It will interrupt your sleep but you will not be awaken to know that it happens.</p>

              <p>If I have to work, usually on office hours.</p>
              <p>I tend to condition myself to sleep around 10.30pm.  Switch off pc, msn and so on at 9.30pm to give the mind the chance to chill down before sleep.</p>
              <p>I dont necessary have sleep problems, but different temperature, different hormones imbalance or simply drinking too much water will cause me to wake up at strange hours.</p>
              <p>So I regulate myself to sleep at 10.30pm.  So even if I had interuppted sleep, I can still make up for it before I really need to wake up for work.</p>
              <p>And if I wake up earlier, lets say 5 am, with uninterrupted sleep.  I try to get up from bed instead of lazing.</p>
              <p>Stretch, drink water, go toliet, take my time to ride out before the rush hour starts and before the weather heats up. (Auntie ride motorcycle.)  Go for leisurely breakfast and a good read of newspaper before getting to work at least half an hour early.</p>
              <p>This give me time to resort myself, or at least get ready for work.  And can feel at least a bit proud that I am always ready and alert while everyone is still trying to pick up their pieces.</p>

              <p>Actually if its happening alot and affecting your concentration and studies, it might be best for you to consult a doctor or a sleep specialist and see whether they can help you improve your sleep since the last thing you want happening is to feel tired and sleepy during your O's.</p>
              <p>Personally i almost fell asleep during my O's many yrs ago during my chem and phys paper 1 since they were both afternoon papers with a paper in the morning. End up i only got a B3 for both which sort of below standard considering it was my 1st B for chemistry in any major exam in sec sch...</p>

              <p>Could also be TS's room isnt that conductive to sleeping.</p>
              <p>Maybe its the temperature, the air, the bed condition, the lights conditions and the timing situation.</p>
              <p>Temperature is best to be kept cool.  A hot shower before sleep will help the body to wind down to sleeping temperature.</p>
              <p>Air: Windows open, dusts in the room makes your room itchy?  Bad smells or not sunning your pillow?</p>
              <p>Bed: It accumulated bad vibes from long time use, maybe a spring is broken, or you are too used to the shape of it which makes your now bigger body uncomfortable.</p>
              <p>Lights condition refers to your having your handphone, laptop or tv on standby mode, having a kind of blinking lights or that someone may call you and your body naturally keep alert for blinking lights of your handphone.  Same with your laptop/pc lights,  Too much blue light before you sleep (screen light) projecting into your brain before you sleep makes you too alert to sleep.  So do consider shutting pc down 1 hour before you sleep and keep your handphone away, and turn off tv totally instead of leaving its standby lights on.</p>
              <p>Lastly is timing........Your body can keep a schedule.  But you arent using the body clock properly with regular sleep time.</p>

              <p>Just continue to monitor the situation and try to keep a more structured timetable so you can sleep and wakeup at roughly the same time each day to see whether its just a case of irregular sleeping patterns or is there something more into the problem.</p>
              <p>Nah for both MCQs paper i'm sure i did doze off and a decent number of questions was done in half asleep mode so the outcome wasn't really too unexpected nor surprising but just abit disappointing esp on my chem teacher part but its all history.</p>
              <p>In the end i'm still able to get into uni so in a way thats the only purpose O's had serve.</p>
              <p>FYI, i quit BP mentoring so won't be going to ur school anymore since i now go to a students care center to volunteer every sat instead.</p>
