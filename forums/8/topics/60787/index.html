            <div class='col-md body'>I met her on the net, how?<br><br>I can't remember. but it seems to me that it is<br>this 'little theory' which I declared in the<br>cyberspace that caught her attention.<br><br>If I have a million dollars, I would buy a house.<br>do I have a million? No.<br>that's why I don't have a house.<br><br>If I have wings, I can fly. do I have wings? No.<br>so I can never fly.<br><br>If all the waters are drawn out of Pacific Ocean,<br>but it still can't put off the flame of love<br>between us. Can all the waters of Pacific Ocean<br>be drawn off? No. That's why I don't love you.<br><br>That's me, a typical science student. First you<br>come up with an assumption, then you fit a<br>suitable conclusion.<br><br>If the proposed assumption doesn't stand at all,<br>then everything is just bullshit. I guess this is<br>what they call 'unromantic'.<br><br>But she is an exception. she actually mailed me<br>and said that I am an interesting' person.<br><br>'Interesting'? What a word to use on me, it's<br>like using 'faithful' on Mr. Clinton. I thought<br>this girl must be a low-IQ organism, or suffering<br>from serious brain damage.<br><br>Anyway, her nick doesn't seems so bad -FLYNDANCE-<br>that's quite a unique one.<br><br>But I was warning myself: hello, this is the<br>virtual world of Internet. who knows what might<br>be lurking behind a beautiful nick.<br><br>Talking from experience, most of the time it will<br>be a 'dinosaur' in<br>disguise. The only differences will be whether it<br>is a carnivore or a<br>herbivore but, I know she is way different from<br>a 'dinosaur', she is special ....<br><br>So I guess its time for the appearance of<br>FlyNDance.<br><br>Ever since she mailed to tell me that I<br>am 'interesting', I was always wishing to meet<br>her in AJCRR. Too bad, lady luck was just not on<br>my side. So I can only reply her letter to tell<br>her that I will start to train myself to become<br>an 'interesting' person, just to show that she is<br>far-sighted.<br><br>She replied my reply, I replied her reply to my<br>reply, she again replied my reply to her reply<br>blah blah blah... Oh no, I just started a chain-<br>reaction.<br>Actually what interested me the most is this<br>paragraph she wrote in one of the mails....<br><br>'I dance swiftly, amidst the crowd.<br>Your glance on me be it surprise, be it<br>admiration, it ain't going to stop my rhythm.<br>Because it's not your glance that made me dance,<br>it's my heart of youth.'<br>I simply cannot relate this girl to any of<br>the 'dinosaurs'. But if she really is a dinosaur,<br>I am willing to let her have her fill.<br><br>Tye, my best pal unfortunately, noticed my little<br>affair with FlyNDance, and has been perpetually<br>warning me about this.<br><br>"HELLO! You don't even know what she looks like,<br>why take the risk?? Maybe she' is a guy!"<br><br>I can't blame Tye for his ignorance. Ever since<br>he was dumped by Sally in Secondary 4, he has<br>become a renowned 'playboy'.<br><br>As the saying goes: "Once bitten, Twice shy".<br><br>In this case, after Tye was bitten, he has<br>mastered the art of skinning snakes alive, and<br>make them into soup. But he got all the factors<br>to be a playboy, I always think he is the 19 year-<br>old version of Brad Pitt.<br><br>Tall, handsome and got this tongue that causes<br>diabetes in every women he targets. I don't think<br>he can even remember how many girlfriends he has<br>had.<br><br>I went online that night, log onto channel AJCRR<br>and yes!<br><br>She is there.<br><br>Before I can get over the surprise and the daze,<br>she sent me a message.<br><br>"Hey Slorr, so late liao haven't sleep ah?"<br><br>Now what? Now what? Ok ok, I had to calm down<br>first. I swallowed hard on my saliva, took a few<br>deep breath.<br><br>Now where is that Tye when I needed him most at<br>such crucial moment, somebody to tell me what to<br>say to her. How am I going to attract her with my<br>pathetic humor, which has gone stale.<br><br>"Slorr, me in a foul mood today. Can't sleep, you<br>leh?"<br><br>MOTHER'S (direct translation to Chinese), what<br>Slorr Slorr...<br><br>Now when I read it twice in a row, I am beginning<br>to feel disgusted in that nick Tye gave me. Tye<br>said that: "Who knows, it might attract some<br>innocent gals in talking to you."<br><br>"I am not feeling very good too. So let's sad<br>together."<br><br>Finally squeezed a sentence out, but I can<br>already feel droplets of sweat forming on my<br>forehead. Actually I am not in a bad mood, I just<br>wanna follow up her topic that's all.<br><br>And if she ask for the reason for my feeling<br>down, I can say:<br><br>"Since you are feeling down, how can I ever be<br>happy?"<br><br>I know it sounds mushy, but Tye said: "MUSHINESS<br>IS THE FUNDAMENTAL TO ALL COURTSHIP."<br><br>And gals are a very weird species, they trust<br>their ears far more than their eyes. So instead<br>of doing 10 things to impress her, why not just<br>say a sentence to move her.<br><br>"Ok, but you haven't greet me leh."<br><br>DAMNIT!.. how can I forget simple manners to<br>gals. To think they call me MR COURTEOUS' in<br>school.<br><br>If this thing ever leaks out in school, I would<br>lose all my female fans.<br><br>"Nice to meet you, miss long-hair."<br><br>"I've been wishing that she's keeping long hair.<br><br>Tye said that:<br><br>"FlyNDance... hmm.. she would either be long-<br>haired or a desperado, 'COs when gals dance, only<br>2 parts of them may fly: hair and skirt. So if<br>she doesnÂ�ft has long hair, that means her skirt<br>flies when she dances, AH-HA!!.. this has a<br>certain sexual hint in it...haha.."<br><br>"Eh? How you know I got long hair?"<br><br>BINGO! Heaven is on my side this time. It goes to<br>prove that she is not a DESPERADO. Yes!<br><br>"Not only that, I also know you seldom wear<br>skirt."<br><br>I increased the stake, if I am correct this time,<br>peace on earth forever.<br><br>"Err... I guess you are right lor. But how you<br>know one?"<br><br>"Just guess."<br><br>"Ok lor. Hey Slorr, tell you what, me tired liao,<br>you coming online<br>tomorrow morning?"<br><br>"Ya, why??"<br><br>"Please please please say the you coming too, if<br>not I am going to kill myself for letting you go<br>tonight. I'll see ya tomorrow at 10 am then. Good<br>night."<br><br>"Er.. should be today at 10 am.. ok.. good night<br>too."<br><br>I just blurted out a last sentence ....Offline.<br><br>Suddenly I was so impressed by my performance<br>just now.<br><br>But is the season of spring really arriving for<br>me?? I wish...............<br><br>Slorr, what a coincidence ahh"<br><br>"Yeh, I am not late."<br><br>"Ya lor, so qiao."<br><br>Girls are weird, I thought we already had an<br>arrangement, why do I have to pretend that its<br>not.<br><br>They must have watched too many movies, and like<br>to think that guys they met due to the thing<br>called 'fate' is the best thing that can happen<br>to their love life.<br><br>"Slorr, you talking nonsense lah."<br><br>"NONSENSE? Ok, let me tell you what is nonsense.<br>Summer's beach, the guy must be good at running,<br>with broad shoulders, dark complexion with a tint<br>of redness, sparkling eyes and loud laughter.<br><br>Then he will call out loud the name of the girl,<br>running towards her, carry her and spin 3 rounds<br>anticlockwisely."<br><br>"Slorr, you siao liaoz ahh?"<br><br>"I siao? Ok, let's change a location then. Deep<br>in the mountains, the guy must have long hair,<br>gotta have the look of an artist, carries a<br>sketching stand, a few pieces of drawings, and<br>you can see birds stop over at his side admiring<br>his work. And there will be a girl whose the<br>model, most probably naked."<br><br>"Slorr, but these all very romantic mah."<br>"ROMANTIC? Hello miss, romance only survive in<br>novels and movies.<br><br>In real life, the guy on the beach may step onto<br>broken glass or the girl may be too heavy which<br>tore his arm muscles.<br><br>Birds may just clear their waste on top of the<br>guy in the mountains, or he might get a thrashing<br>from the girl because he comments on the excess<br>fats around the waist and hips."<br><br>"Slorr, you hate romance?"<br><br>"I hate romance? Nope, I am just using my<br>knowledge of statistics to get a deduction, that<br>guys must be TALL to be romantic, not HANDSOME!!!<br>Some love novels even portrayed the guy as normal<br>looking, but no-one dares to challenge the height<br>of him! I object, because I am not tall."<br><br>"?Slorr.... objection overruled..."<br><br>I think I am really outstandingly bo liao,<br>talking to her about these until noon.<br><br>"Slorr, are you hungry?"<br><br>"Ya, you leh?"<br><br>"Yes, guess its time for lunch...Slorr.."<br><br>"Then do you think we should?"<br><br>"Slorr, I am just asking. I don't intend to have<br>lunch with you."<br><br>"Ok, good. I am not romantic, neither are you."<br><br>I had lunch with Tye, we talk about the<br>conversation with FlyNDance this morning.<br><br>"You moron. Told her you are not romantic, you<br>siao ah? You have disgraced me man. How can you<br>make such a big mistake?"<br><br>"....I...I..."<br><br>Tye grabbed a chicken wing with chopstick, and I<br>can see the trembling of the hand and the wing.<br><br>"There are 3 'don'ts' in chasing a girl...<br>One, don't forget to be romantic;<br><br>Two, don't be too honest;<br><br>Three, don't be too stingy on the sugar in our<br>speech.<br><br>In mandarin, we say 'nan ren bu huai, nu ren bu<br>ai', you should know this."<br><br>"This I know, but it has been a controversial<br>topic over centuries. Women aren't really that,<br>cheap"<br><br>"So why would they only falls for 'bad guys' like<br>me?"<br><br>"That's because 'bad guys' are usually romantic.<br>Those 'nice guys' are usually, dumdums. So she<br>would rather choose a romantic 'bad guy' rather<br>than any of those dumdums. In math we call this<br>2C1, understand? dumdum."<br><br>Oh, Tye is talking about math! Now I understand.<br>No wonder I have always been left on the shelf.<br><br>"In another words, gals wouldn't mind if you are<br>not tall... if you are not handsome... they can<br>bear with your inconsiderate acts... can forget<br>your stupidity... but they can never forgive if<br>you are not romantic..."<br><br>"Come on, this is so exaggerating."<br><br>"Hey, most women have a 'knot' for romance, just<br>like most men have a 'knot for virginity. To<br>women they just can't understand how precious the<br>thin layer of membrane is to men. Same thing, men<br>can't imagine how important women treats romance."<br><br>"This is bullshit! How come I've never heard of<br>that."<br><br>"The key word is 'knot', if you can untie it,<br>fine. But how many had actually succeeded in<br>that. Practically none."<br><br>"Ok, fine. Now I've done it. So what should I do<br>to remedy the situation?"<br><br>"Face it. You are hopeless already."<br><br>I promise you I'll have a drink with you when you<br>and her are over."<br><br>You SON OF A BXXCH.<br><br>Midnight. I am trying to concentrate on my<br>physics notes...<br><br>F=ma, v=u+at...<br><br>It's really a wonder that nature can be explained<br>by just a few formulas and equations, and this we<br>call science.<br><br>Then why is astrology and palmistry being labeled<br>as superstitions?<br>Science should only be one of the ways to explain<br>truth, what can't be explained by science, it<br>doesn't necessary mean that it's unreal....<br><br>Close to 1 am. Since I can't get anything into my<br>head, I shall try my luck on net then, maybe she<br>is there.<br><br>"Slorr, you here."<br><br>"Finally, good night to you "<br><br>'FINALLY'? Strange word to use it here. What is<br>she doing here at this hour? Must be feeling down<br>again.<br><br>"Yes, it is fate that brought me to you at this<br>moment."<br><br>I am trying very hard to convince her that I am a<br>bit romantic.<br><br>"Slorr, nothing to do with fate. I waited for you<br>for one hour liaoz..."<br><br>"Sure or not? For what?"<br><br>"Talk to you mah or else I can't sleep."<br><br>"You sick is it? Go see doctor lah "<br><br>"Slorr, let's continue our topic.<br><br>What do you think of relationships that began<br>from the Internet?"<br><br>Oh my god, how should I answer her now?<br><br>"It's... it's very... romantic..."<br><br>Indeed I am not a good liar, even my words are<br>shaking now.<br><br>"Slorr, you bluffing. You not romantic one mah."<br>GAME OVER. I am finished! No choice but to drink<br>with Tye.<br><br>"Slorr, you lagging? Or just daoing me?"<br><br>"No, I am wondering why is the sky so chio<br>tonight?"<br><br>"No no no. Don't try to shift the topic, Slorr."<br><br>Sigh. I give up. I asked for it myself.<br><br>"Actually I think relationships started from<br>cyberspace is considered as ROMANTIC, cos romance<br>gives people an impression of unreal, and<br>cyberspace is virtual."<br><br>"Slorr, that's interesting."<br><br>"Surfers keep a safe distance from each other and<br>usually 3 types of people are produced in this<br>way.<br><br>The first type....<br><br>The first type are those who present themselves<br>on net with their secondary personality'. Usually<br>all of us consist of multiple personalities and<br>in everyday life, what we present to the world is<br>the 'primary personality', with the secondary one<br>being suppressed, or maybe we don't even realised<br>this other trait of us deep inside. So Internet<br>is the place where this side of us is revealed,<br>both intentionally or without conscious<br>knowledge."<br><br>"Is it true? What about 2nd type?"<br><br>"The 2nd type are those who will transform<br>themselves into the kind of man/woman he/she<br>would want to be. There's bound to be 1 or 2<br>characteristics that you particularly admire, too<br>bad, sometimes these characteristics are just<br>couldn't be found in you. Cyberspace is the<br>perfect location for this transformation to<br>occur."<br><br>Slorr, you blowing cow, is it? Type 3 leh?"<br><br>"I am not blowing cow, I read it from an article<br>of TIMES magazine! Type 3 will be those who<br>transform themselves into characters which are<br>impossible for them to become in real life.<br><br>For example, if you are a girl, you may act as a<br>man on net. You may even become BATMAN or<br>SUPERMAN if you want."<br><br>"Hmmh.. That's pretty amazing."<br><br>"The first type is the 'faithful' type, 'cos its<br>his own personality that is being presented on<br>net.<br>The 2nd type is the 'foolish' type, 'cos he knows<br>only how to admire others always forgets his own<br>strong points.<br><br>The 3rd type is the 'pathetic' type, 'cos he is<br>wishing 4 some impossible."<br><br>"Slorr, then you belong to what type? Me leh?"<br><br>"I don't wish to believe you are type 3, 'cos I<br>am not.<br><br>I crossed the possibility of type 1 'cos its too<br>common, because I think you are special. Being<br>able to attract you, I think I am at least a bit<br>special. So we belong to type 2."<br><br>"Type 2, then who you wish to become? Slorr.."<br><br>I certainly would like to become a person like<br>Tye, humorous, romantic and eloquent, 'cos these<br>are what I am lacking of.<br><br>"Slorr, what about me?"<br><br>"you? I don't know. you want to FLY and DANCE,<br>probably that means you wish to fully enjoy your<br>youth while you can. But if this is something you<br>wish yet you can't achieve, then there's 2<br>possibilities:<br><br>1, you are aging, 2, you are leaving the world."<br><br>I think I said something wrong, cos she didn't<br>sent me anymore message after this. I began to<br>blame myself for being so perverted, why talk<br>about these things?<br><br>I should have discussed with her whether ZOE or<br>FANN, who should be the queen of Caldecott Hill.<br>Damn that TIMES magazine! Poisons my mind. Maybe<br>sheÃ·Ã• lagging. So I waited... and waited. Girl,<br>its just a few minutes, but it felt like several<br>hours. I want to apologize, but do not know how<br>to start, until she sent me this message:<br><br>"Slorr... let's meet..."<br><br>Without hesitation, I used the hand that I had<br>used it over 18 years to wipe my ass, typed 'O-K'.<br><br>I am supposed to meet FlyNDance tonight , 8pm, at<br>the entrance of McDonalds the one beside YMCA.<br>That's the best time and place to meet a girl you<br>have never met before, according to Tye, 'cos<br>they would have taken their dinner by that time<br>which means we can simply go inside the Mac and<br>have some fries and coke.<br><br>She will be wearing a whole set of coffee theme<br>attire and I will be wearing my usual blues, this<br>is our way of identification.<br>She told me she is not those 'cute gals' I may<br>think she is, I said never mind, I am not<br>Brad-pitt either. Then she told me she has long<br>ago given up on this hope already.<br><br>"Slorr, you are early."<br><br>While I was idling, a girl tapped my shoulders<br>from my back.<br><br>Although I was already mentally prepared for<br>anything that's going to appear in front of me, I<br>was still astonished by this girl who stood in<br>front of me now.<br><br>If not for the coffee theme and that 'Slorr', I<br>would think she is only asking for directions.<br>She is one of those 'chio bu' that can only be<br>found on Orchard Road, which I usually see while<br>crossing the road. Maybe I suffered from a<br>serious concussion due to the heavy blow, my mind<br>was extraordinarily calm.<br><br>"Had your dinner right? I think we shall go<br>inside the Mac first."<br><br>"You are pretty smart huh? A good way to save<br>money indeed."<br><br>AIYA! She knows me so well, I can only give her<br>an innocent smile back.<br><br>Since she's so pretty, I ordered 2 LARGE cokes,<br>and even ordered TWO packets of fries.<br><br>"This time you treat, next time I'll let you<br>treat."<br><br>I am not falling for that, miss. But I am glad<br>she mentioned 'next time'.<br><br>"Slorr, are you disappointed when you saw me just<br>now?"<br><br>DISSAPPOINTED? Are you drunk?<br><br>"Why do you think I will be disappointed then?"<br><br>"Cos I told you I am not cute mah, so you must be<br>quite dissappointed when you saw me"<br><br>She is making zero-sense, but I know she is just<br>trying to hint that she's actually cute.<br><br>"Then why did you have to lie that you are not<br>cute?"<br><br>"Slorr. I said I am not cute. I didn't say I am<br>not pretty."<br><br>#$%$##%^*&amp;%$@!!!<br><br>"But you are also quite decent looking what it's<br>not like what you described to me too."<br><br>'DECENT'? A very vague word. To many gals,<br>decent=boring. One good thing is that she didn't<br>lie to me about the fact that she is keeping long<br>hair. She also has a fair complexion which<br>reminds me of HL milk I take almost everyday.<br><br>It is now only that I found out she is from ACJC,<br>but had spent her first 3 mths in AJ.<br><br>Sitting in front of each other, we talk about<br>many things. From her obsession with coffee to my<br>hobby of watching movies. BTW, she had completely<br>shook off my misconception of 'if she is pretty,<br>she is brainless<br>She appears to be an attractive girl, both<br>physically and character wise, talking, smiling<br>to me, occasionally being a little sarcastic and<br>nasty.<br><br>It's like a dream.<br><br>We left the Mac at around 10 pm. Since it's still<br>early, I decided to send her home and<br>fortunately, it's just Ang Mo Kio, two MRT stops<br>from mine.<br><br>I would have second thoughts if she's staying at<br>Pasir Ris.<br><br>"Slorr, congratulations! You are officially<br>permitted to date me from now on."<br><br>She said this before the lift door closed.<br><br>Back at home, I realized that I hadn't asked for<br>her real name, maybe it's the influence of that<br>stupid Tye.<br><br>Tye told me:<br><br>Never ask a pretty girl her name the first time<br>you meet her, cos there are already too many<br>wolves out there dying to know, so she will be<br>more interested in you if you act bochap.<br>Then why didn't she ask for mine? Don't tell me<br>there's a female version of Tye telling her not<br>to?<br><br>It's again 1 am. Time to meet her in ajcrr.<br><br>"Hi! Slorr you tired?"<br><br>Of course I am tired after all the surprises she<br>presented me, I would go straight for my bed if<br>not for her. But why is she here also? Isn't she<br>tired too?<br><br>Long time no see how are you?"<br><br>"Slorr you siao ah? 2 hours only leh... miss me?"<br>"A)Yes B)Of Course C)Abuden D)Dying to see you E)<br>All of above. Answer is E.<br><br>Seems like she is really tired, even the smiling<br>face are yawning to me right now.<br><br>"You wanna go for a movie tomorrow?"<br><br>Maybe I should ask her now, while she is half<br>asleep, hoping that she will blur-blurly<br>click 'OK'.<br><br>"Should be no problem. What show?."<br><br>HOOOOORAY!! I am cheering for her fatigue.<br><br>"We decide what show tomorrow. Anyway what's<br>important is watch with who.<br>Not the show."<br><br>Tye's favourite line, I am just borrowing it.<br><br>"You should go sleep now lah."<br><br>"Wait one little while. You haven't tell me you<br>tired or not?"<br><br>"Ok lah, A bit. You leh?"<br><br>"I am exhausted but have to say good night to you<br>first. Slorr, if not I can't sleep."<br><br>"Me too."<br><br>I can't believe I am doing this SILLY business<br>right now.<br><br>"Ok I tell you what I count 1,2,3. Then we log<br>off together."<br><br>"Ok good night Slorr."<br><br>"Same to you"<br><br>"1..."<br><br>"2..."<br><br>"3..."<br><br>I never talk whenever I am inside a cinema, and<br>now is the best time for my mouth to rest, so I<br>spent the following 3 hours to admire this much-<br>talked-about movie of the century, Titanic.<br><br>I am not a romantic person, so it's perfectly<br>understandable if I can't really appreciate this<br>motion picture fully, except for all those<br>stunning special effects. But something struck me<br>when Jack said to Rose before he sank into the<br>deep.....<br><br>"Rose, listen to me... listen.... winning that<br>ticket was the best thing that had happened to<br>me... it brought me to you....and I am thankful,<br>Rose.. .I am thankful...."<br><br>Suddenly I felt much fortunate than Jack, because<br>I don't have to risk my life to board Titanic,<br>all I have to do is to switch on my PC every<br>night.<br><br>But he's one lucky guy too, because he knows how<br>to draw, and just look at how slowly he was<br>drawing Rose, that made me blame myself for the<br>lack of this talent. But to her, this movie<br>wasn't just about drawings or special effects. I<br>noticed that packet of tissue paper she was<br>holding in her hand. and just when Rose said: "I<br>promise... I will never let go, Jack... i'll<br>never let go.."<br><br>She opened up her sling bag and here comes the<br>reserve handkerchief. Damn that Celine Dion, why<br>on earth did she had to sing that "MY HEART WILL<br>GO ON at the end of the show, for all the female<br>species inside the theater, its like "MY TEARS<br>WILL ALSO GO ON".<br><br>"Ok, movie ended. Let's go."<br><br>I stood up, speak to her gently, worried that<br>every single word I breathe out might just crush<br>onto her, and kill her. She continued to sit on<br>the position, looked at me with her beautiful<br>eyes that just came back from a swim.<br><br>After a while, she said "Slorr, movie ended, but<br>life goes on. Am I right?"<br><br>I nodded my head. But I just wished somebody<br>might give me some clue of what she was saying.<br>Finally we managed to leave Orchard Cineplex,<br>since its still early, we decided to take a walk<br>down the street.<br><br>Along the way, she seems unusually quiet. So I<br>guess Tye was right about the 'TITANIC FLU', he<br>said that gals often got so mentally distressed<br>after watching this show, and it's the best time<br>to launch an emotional attack on her, that's why<br>Tye had watch Titanic for over 5 times roughly.<br><br>Her eyes were focused on the path or the crowds<br>but I know her mind was still left on Titanic,<br>sinking with her, waiting for somebody to pull<br>her up.<br><br>I just kept my mouth shut. I know I am not a good<br>swimmer. We walked to Plaza Singapura. Suddenly<br>she stopped in front of a Christian Dior counter.<br><br>"Slorr, have you read a novel called 'Fragrance'?"<br><br>"Err..nope. Why do you ask?"<br><br>"Look at this 'DOLCE VITA' from Christian Dior.<br>It's what the guy bought for her girlfriend in<br>the story on her birthday. And he told her 'DOLCE<br>VITA is French, meaning 'SWEET TIMES'"<br><br>She pointed to a bottle of perfume at the<br>counter, but I was more interested at the price<br>tag around the neck of the bottle.<br><br>"Oh... is it?"<br><br>"Slorr, then do you consider today as 'sweet<br>times'?"<br><br>"At first I do, but some points are deducted<br>since you started crying."<br><br>"That means it can only be considered a little<br>bit sweet, I'll buy the small bottle then."<br><br>I insisted to pay for the perfume as her birthday<br>present from me since I know her birthday is<br>coming soon, this kind of saves me a lot of<br>trouble of finding a present for her. Luckily<br>it's just perfume, or I would have to pawn my<br>underwear if that guy in the story gives her<br>girlfriend diamond or gold bar.<br><br>"Are you hungry? Wanna sit down and have<br>something?"<br><br>"I don't have appetite, what about you?"<br><br>"You eat, I eat..."<br><br>Her eyes are red again. I am such a fool. Finally<br>got away from the noisy crowd at the MRT station,<br>walking on one of the streets of AMK Ave 6.<br>Contrastingly, it's so quiet now that I even can<br>hear the rhythm of her heartbeat."<br><br>"Slorr, do you know what's the correct way of<br>applying perfume?"<br><br>I shook my head. In fact, I had never used a<br>perfume or cologne before, medicated oil maybe.<br><br>"First you apply some behind your ears, then your<br>neck and wrists. After that spray some onto the<br>air, then walk through it."<br><br>"Sure or not?"<br><br>"In that case this little bottle won't even be<br>able to last you for 3 days"<br><br>"Slorr, shall we try?"<br><br>"We? You go ahead. I am a MAN."<br><br>She opened up that DOLCE VITA, behind her ears,<br>neck then the wrist she applied some and she<br>really did spray some onto the air!!<br><br>WABIANGZ!! Expensive leh! Finally she stretched<br>out her hands, facing up like enjoying the<br>raindrops falling on her face.<br><br>"Hahaha...."<br><br>"Slorr, this is so fun! Now its your turn."<br><br>She went through the same procedures with me and<br>I can feel the coldness of her fingers. Maybe<br>it's the perfume, I guess.<br><br>"Slorr, get ready, I am going to spray!!"<br><br>I imitated her. Face up and walked through my<br>first perfume rain.<br><br>"Slorr let's have another round!!"<br><br>" WHAT!! Serious?"<br><br>My money isn't easy to come by leh!! Before I can<br>collect the broken pieces of my heart, she had<br>walked through her second round. She was even<br>more excited this time, hoping around, likes her<br>nickname. A flying and dancing butterfly. Late<br>night of AMK, the street smells unusually nicer<br>right now. Until we finished the whole of that<br>DOLCE VITA.<br><br>"DOLCE VITA is exhausted."<br><br>"I guess this sweet time shall end now too.<br>Slorr, I'll go up now. Tonight<br>1 am, I won't be online, and you are not to do so<br>too."<br><br>"Huh? But why?"<br><br>"Go online at 12pm tomorrow. You will know....<br>Remember, only 12pm..."<br><br>She turned and walked into the lift. At the same<br>time, I saw an obvious pink patch behind her<br>neck, which is visible only now because she tied<br>her hair.<br><br>I looked up towards her window on the 4th floor<br>from below, but it never light up.<br><br>I switched off the light in my room. Engulfed in<br>the absolute darkness. I wished to have the same<br>kind of feeling as her right now. I realized in<br>complete darkness, the easiest mood one gets...<br>is loneliness. She must be lonely right now, half<br>asleep.<br><br>I almost can see a beautiful butterfly, turning<br>to ashes amidst the sea of flame. And that patch<br>behind her neck.. from pink it became red. Then<br>burgundy. Slowly, it swallowed me was it the<br>cause of that can of beer just now?<br><br>Suddenly I felt cold and shaky. And that coolness<br>seemed to have come straight from my heart, the<br>rate of my heartbeat was an exponential function<br>of time as it got closer to 1 am.<br><br>USE A DIFFERENT NICK!!<br><br>Checked..<br><br>She isn't there; my heart was beating fast. But<br>the temperature remained below healthy level....<br><br>-=~@~=-<br>Finally itÂ�fs 12 p.m., excited as I was, logged<br>on the net, yet there was still no sign of<br>FlyNDance. But there's a mail from her:<br><br>Dear Slorr,<br>At first I thought it will be easier for me to<br>settle down in the darkness.. recollecting<br>memories we have shared... but all I felt was<br>loneliness..... Can you feel it too?...<br><br>I still can't change the habit of logging on at<br>1am... so I used a different nick to sneak into<br>AJCRR... you don't blame me right?...... you<br>werenÂ�ft there... should I feel glad for your<br>obedience?.... you said both of us belonged to<br>TYPE 2... the foolish type...maybe you are<br>right!... 'COs I really do admire those who dares<br>to fight for their desires... I stroke my hair<br>gently when you said that I am leaving the<br>world... and a few strands of hair fell.....<br>No!... doctor told me its not a terminal<br>disease... and doctor aren't supposed to<br>lie!!?... I still can live like a normal person...<br>BUT CAN I ?<br><br>FlyNDance... is it really something I wont be<br>able to do?... After the first meeting with you<br>at Mac... I started to realize that you are not<br>only a virtual being living in the cyberspace...<br>in reality you are strong, gentle and<br>sensitive.... I can feel the defense Wall of my<br>heart is slowly breaking apart.... I am<br>defeated... I tied my hair today.. 'cos my fren<br>told me that I look more attractive this way...<br><br>I want you to remember my face as it is<br>today... 'cos after today... everything may<br>change.... But why didn't you ask for my real<br>name? ..thatÂ�fs why I never asked for urs...<br><br>I am a girl mah..... do you realized how I wish<br>to have something more than a nick to take along<br>with me? ...Slorr... thank you for the DOLCE<br>VITA. Finally got a taste of what sweet times are<br>like... but I am really sorry.<br><br>??.I just couldnÂ�ft bear to say goodbye.....<br><br>Since it started from a mail.... it should end<br>with a mail too.... Its been 3 months and 2 days<br>since the very first mail... not a very long time<br>but it isn't short either.... our story began<br>from me... and I will end it.<br><br>Maybe its what you said... 'Internet is fast and<br>convenient, but it isn't perfect'.... I can send<br>you my thoughts right away... but not my tears...<br>ItÂ�fs about 5.30am now.... time to go.... by the<br>time you receive this mail...<br>I would be trying to settle down somewhere<br>else.... I don't know....<br>Good Bye<br><br>With lotsa love,<br>FlyNDance<br><br>After reading her mail, I felt as if I had just<br>experienced a roller-coaster ride which almost<br>derailed. She had shown me the other side of her,<br>soft and sensitive.<br><br>For a couple of months, I was trying to<br>hypnotizes myself, to suppress my feelings<br>whenever I started to think about her again.<br>Perpetually I was telling myself, she is just one<br>virtual character that fly and dance in the net,<br>but never in the real world. I became a fugitive,<br>escaping from my PC, escaping from the Internet<br>and anything that has to do with coffee. Hide<br>myself behind the piles of lecture notes, behind<br>the crowd of people, trying to get rid of this<br>thought of missing something in life.<br><br>But I failed. I found out that its not that I<br>don't miss her, its just that I had forgotten the<br>passion that always comes along when you are<br>having something hanging on your mind all the<br>time. Its like I cannot breathe, itÂ�fs just that<br>I had forgotten the fact that I have been<br>breathing in and out for the past 19 years.<br><br>I can hold my breath for a while, but not forever.<br><br>I have to find her!<br><br>"Err... I am looking for ... er..FlyNDance...."<br><br>"HUH??..."<br><br>'Huh', this is the exact word I was expecting<br>from her.<br><br>She seems to be FlyNDance's elder sister, 20++,<br>looked quite a beauty too even without any<br>makeup. But of course, still can't be compared<br>with her. I explained to her my purpose for<br>knocking on the door and told her that I am no<br>stalker whom she might think I am.<br><br>Surprisingly when I told her my disgusting nick,<br>Slorr, she appeared to be rather excited and<br>quickly she scribbled something on a small piece<br>of paper and handed it to me.<br><br>"You should go and see her. SGH, Room 3-425."<br><br>-=~@~=-<br>This is the first time I've ever stepped into the<br>Singapore General Hospital. It's a dust-free<br>space, everything looked so clean, tidy and<br>arranged.<br><br>But I don't like the feeling it gave me... I<br>entered room 3-425, she was there, in a deep<br>sleep. I stood by her, watching.<br><br>Her hair was still as long as before, laying<br>across the soft, white pillow.<br><br>Her face looked roundish now, I know it's the<br>side-effect of the medicine. And the pinkish-red<br>patch that was on her neck, had spread to her<br>face appearing in a shape of a butterfly.<br><br>Nevertheless, she was still the most beautiful<br>butterfly I've ever seen.<br><br>Her eyelashes twitched slightly, she must be<br>dreaming, what's that in her dream?<br><br>McDonald's fries and coke? Sinking Titanic? Or<br>the rain at AMK Ave 6? The room was getting<br>darker as the clock approaches 6pm.<br>I wanted to switch on the light. I hate to see<br>her lying lonely under the shadow of a patient's<br>room.<br><br>But I am worried that her dreams might be<br>disturbed by the sudden light rays. While I was<br>in a dilemma, her eyes opened slowly. Her eyes<br>were wide on me, then she turned away suddenly.<br><br>I can only see her back at this moment. She lost<br>weight. After a long time, she turned to face me<br>again, rubbed her eyes and smiled....<br><br>"Slorr, you are here!"<br><br>"Yes, nice weather today, isn't it?"<br><br>"Ya lor, sky also very chio today? Right?<br>Heehee.."<br><br>SKY VERY CHIO...<br><br>I can still remember this was the conversation we<br>had in one of our AJCRR meetings."<br><br>But she didn't realize that it's raining today.<br><br>"Slorr, why are you standing there. Sit down."<br><br>Thanks for reminding me. I just found out that my<br>legs were numbed due to the several hours of<br>standing.<br><br>"Slorr, you lost weight."<br><br>ME? I thought I should be the one who's telling<br>this to her!?<br><br>"Slorr, you hungry? Had your lunch? Food here<br>isn't so good. That's why patients like me always<br>slim down a bit. Apart from that, it's quite ok.<br>But sometimes I feel really bored without a PC<br>here to talk to you.."<br><br>"Slorr, how's your mid-year? Sure did very well<br>right?"<br><br>WAIT A MINUTE! You are the one who's lying on bed<br>right now not me! Yet, I had nothing to ask her<br>actually.<br><br>Because I was there to see her, not to find out<br>the answers to those questions. Maybe now its the<br>time for me to utter some touching lines like<br>whatÃ·Ã• in the case of a movie.<br><br>But I am not a Romantic person... moreover...<br><br>Movies are fiction.<br>Life isn't.<br><br>-=~@~=-<br>I just wished that she could leave this place as<br>soon as possible back to AMK Ave 6, back to ACJC,<br>back to where she belonged. And I promised she<br>wonÃ·Ã– be alone anymore, because I will always be<br>there.<br><br>After a while, her mum was here to see her.<br>Around the age of 50, slightly overweight. Other<br>than the cheerful smile, she didn't really remind<br>me of FlyNDance.<br><br>"Err, I think i've gotta go now. Bye bye auntie."<br><br>"You....You..."<br><br>She sat up straight in a sudden, like if she'd<br>experienced a tremendous shock.<br><br>"I'll be here again tomorrow.. and the day after<br>tomorrow... until you leave this place..."<br><br>Before I went back home, I went to Plaza<br>Singapura again to buy that Christian Dior Dolce<br>Vita... and I've got the biggest bottle this<br>time, that she can even swim in it.<br><br>I try not to close my eyes that night, I want to<br>go to her as soon as the first sun ray shoots<br>into my room....<br><br>"Slorr.. you are here.. i've been waiting for you<br>for a long time..."<br><br>"Had a good night's rest?..."<br><br>"Oh... I didn't allow myself to fall into a deep<br>sleep because I know you won't wake me up when<br>your here."<br><br>"Then you should take a rest now."<br><br>"Err, since you are here already, I don't think I<br>can..."<br><br>I gave her the Dolce Vita, and we'd agreed that<br>we would dance in the rain in front of SGH main<br>entrance the day she's discharged.<br><br>I dare not look straight at her, because there's<br>a butterfly on her face.<br>It was only last night before I leave SGH that I<br>found out she's suffering from an illness called<br>ERYSIPELAS. What the clergymen would term the<br>BUTTERFLY DISEASE...<br><br>But what I like is the coffee butterfly that is<br>able to dance around freely not that pinkish-red<br>butterfly that settled on her pale complexion.<br>Moreover, whatÃ·Ã• a butterfly if it can't fly?<br><br>"Slorr, why are you looking at me and not<br>talking?"<br><br>I don't know, because I noticed that she's<br>getting weaker physically. I had a bad feeling<br>about this.<br><br>"Slorr, I am thirsty, can you get me a drink?"<br><br>I am not leaving her at this moment. I can still<br>remember a movie about this guy who went all the<br>way to get red bean soup for his girlfriend who's<br>on sickbed and to find her lying silently on the<br>white bedsheet when he came back... never to wake<br>up again...<br><br>"Are you trying to get rid of me, like what's in<br>that movie?"<br><br>"Slorr, movie is movie, life is life..."<br><br>MOVIE? LIFE?....<br><br>"But I thought you just had a drink? Anyway, so<br>what can I get for you?"<br><br>"Ultimate Ice Blended!!"<br><br>This is a hospital leh!! Did she think I can find<br>Coffee Bean everywhere on this island? Like<br>McDonalds, what's more coffee wasn't suitable for<br>her at that time.<br><br>"Err... coffee isn't good for health, order<br>something else, ok?<br><br>"So you know coffee isn't good for the body too.<br>Then you should cut down on your intake also, ok?"<br><br>I saw her smile appearing and there's a shine in<br>her eyes. I realized that sheÃ·Ã• just trying to<br>tell me not to drink too much coffee in the<br>future.<br><br>My heart seemed to have suffered from a heavy<br>blow.<br><br>This is not good. A taste of pH7 has started to<br>fill my nose. If this is not going to stop, tears<br>might be the next thing that appears in front of<br>her.<br><br>I recalled the chapter on reservoir and dam in<br>physics textbook. Quickly applied the knowledge<br>on myself. Even if it's just a few droplets.<br><br>"Ok, I promise, I'll try my best."<br><br>"And try to sleep earlier in the future and don't<br>skip breakfast..."<br><br>"It's important to you and don't be too obsessed<br>with blue. It makes you look troubled and....."<br><br>This didn't sound good. It's like giving the<br>final instructions before she. I can't bear to<br>let her continue.<br><br>"Ok ok, I'll go get you a drink right away."<br><br>"Slorr, is the machine far away? If it is, then<br>its ok, I don't want it anymore."<br><br>From my mental calculation, men would take 67<br>steps while women would take 85 steps to reach<br>the vending machine right at that corner. Plus<br>the time taken to purchase, average would take a<br>total of 1.8 to 2.1 minutes. Not very far.<br><br>"Quite near."<br><br>"Slorr, come back quick. I don't want to be alone<br>for too long... I hate that feeling."<br><br>I didn't answer her. I just increased my pace....<br><br>*************************<br>*************************<br><br>"Eh... its late already... go to sleep..", my mum<br>was nagging at me again.<br><br>"Ok ok.... 10 more minutes..."<br><br>Until today, FlyNDance had left for more than 2<br>mths.<br><br>I still logged on at 1 am every night, but onto<br>channel DOLCE-VITA which was created by myself,<br>with Slorr and FlyNDance being the only 2 nicks<br>inside, for 10 minutes.<br><br>Although she won't be able to fly and dance in<br>real life anymore, but I still wish that she<br>could continue to do so in the virtual world.<br><br>Even Tye has given up on me...<br><br>"She's gone, why are you still doing this? For<br>what?!!"<br><br>Yet, even if that's the case, I can't allow her<br>soul to be left at the corner of loneliness.<br>Because she said she hated the feeling of being<br>alone.<br><br>I still remember there was a heavy downpour on<br>that day. When I reached SGH they told me... A<br>coffee butterfly flew away from her room at<br>around 1 am last night....<br><br>After that... I can't remember...<br><br>I just knew that I stood at the bus-stop for a<br>whole day and I was all wet because of the rain.<br>Even my face.<br><br>I've been trying hard not to think of her over<br>these 2 months. I've been hoping that her face<br>won't appear in my mind every moment that I<br>breathe, but it's like hoping that the sky isn't<br>blue; the grass isn't green; the stars do not<br>twinkle at night...<br><br>Basically, I was hoping for something impossible<br>to happen. I can't believe that I am of Type 2,<br>even in real life.<br><br>Did I cry?.. NO WAY!..<br><br>I said it before, I am not a romantic person, and<br>this may be due to the deficiency in the hormones<br>that constitutes emotions. Whenever I had the<br>feeling of pH7, I'll browse through<br>those 'FWDS:jokes...' Attention will then be<br>shifted by those dim-wit, low-class jokes...<br><br>So now everything is back to the way it was<br>before I met her 9 mths ago.<br><br>Tye is still flirting around, and I am still the<br>old decent=dull me. But IÃ·Ã˜e stopped taking<br>coffee and beer.<br><br>"Xing ah, is this for you?"<br><br>My mum handed me a letter she picked up in the<br>mailbox this morning.<br><br>I was surprised when I saw 'To:slorr...' written<br>on the envelope.<br><br>That's for me I guess. I opened it up, there was<br>a piece of writing inside, and another coffee<br>envelope.<br><br>Slorr,<br>I am FlyNDance's sister, I think this is how you<br>are addressing her. I am sorry that I do not know<br>your real name, although we'd met before.<br><br>When I was packing her stuffs a few days ago, I<br>found this letter with your name and address<br>already written on it.<br><br>So I posted it to you, because I believe this is<br>what my sister intended to do.<br><br>Best wishes,<br>Xiao Wen<br><br>The letter was sent 3 days ago, and there was<br>another:<br><br>'To:slorr...'<br><br>Followed by my home address written on the coffee<br>envelope. But this handwriting was a lot nicer<br>and the words seemed to be moving swiftly...like<br>in a joyful dance.<br><br>I have no time to figure out how she has gotten<br>my home address. Did I give her in one of my<br>mails?<br><br>I tried to control my trembling hands, slowly, I<br>opened up the envelope. I found a photo, and a<br>half of a movie ticket inside.<br><br>Apart from these, there was a blue letter... with<br>the familiar DOLCE VITA smell on it. The photo<br>showed her, standing on a piece of grassland,<br>wearing the same coffee theme attire on our first<br>meeting at McDonalds.<br><br>Something was written at the back of it....<br><br>Dear slorr,<br>Coffee represents Pisces.. that's me. Blue<br>represents Sagitarius.. that's you. A blue letter<br>inside a coffeee envelope.... know what I mean?<br><br>Seeing me, do you feel like drinking coffee now?<br>Stop drooling!<br><br>FlyNDance<br><br>I smiled.... bitterly. The contents of the blue<br>letter is simple:<br><br>If I have one more day to live, I want to be your<br>girlfriend. Do I have one more day? No. Too bad.<br>I can't be your girlfriend... not in this life.<br>If I have wings, I want to fly down from the<br>paradise just to see you. Do I have wings? No.<br>Sadly. I can never see you again.<br><br>If all the water are drawn out of the bath-tub,<br>but it still can't put off the flame of love btw<br>us. Can all the water in a bath-tub be drawn off?<br>Can.<br><br>So yes. I LOVE YOU.<br><br>FlyNDance<br><br>My chest was torn apart... tears broke through<br>the dam I constructed a long time go in a jiffy.<br><br>As proud, as emotionless as I was, I can't pull<br>back the salty wetness thatÃ·Ã• on the whole of my<br>face anymore.<br><br>She has changed my 'little theory' and gotten<br>back what I'd owed her... tears for 2 months....<br><br>-=~@~=-<br>Titanic has won 11 awards in the Oscar, including<br>best picture.<br><br>Yet, Rose wasn't the best actress under that<br>category. So if it's sad in a movie, it may not<br>be so fortunate too in real life. And in reality,<br>should Jack hold on to Rose and 'Never let go?'<br><br>Maybe he shouldn't be worried about this. 'Cos<br>that beautiful coffee butterfly will continue to<br>fly and dance in his heart.. forever...'<br><br>~THE END~</div>
