            <div class='col-md body'>Take Note For Wireless Users.<br>From the strait times website:-<br><br>Watch it! Your Wi-Fi network may be hijacked<br><br>Laziness and ignorance could mean others are helping themselves to your bandwidth - without you being any wiser<br><br>By Ho Ka Wei<br><br>WHILE surfing wirelessly in his living room, Mr Peter Loo stumbled upon another network - his neighbour's.<br><br>Surprised by his ease of entry into another person's not-so-private network, Mr Loo, 48, promptly took measures to secure his own, including cutting his transmitter's range by putting it under a table.<br><br>He also told his neighbour about the unintended breach.<br><br>His neighbour was lucky - a more determined hacker could easily pick out user identities, passwords, files and more if he had 'hijacked' the wireless signals.<br><br>As more homes are hooked up for wireless broadband connections - so several laptops or desktops can share one subscription - some new Wireless Internet (Wi-Fi) users like Mr Loo are concerned that many may not know the dangers in having an unsecured network.<br><br>While there are no numbers to suggest the extent or seriousness of the problem of people hijacking another's bandwidth - simply because the rightful user may not even know it's happening to report it - it does happen.<br><br>Gartner's research director for mobile and wireless, Mr Robin Simpson, told The Straits Times that people have been doing it, 'not with evil intent, but mainly just to get free bandwidth'.<br><br>He added: 'The home user is a big risk as he is a relatively untrained user. Security is easy to set up, but the problem is laziness or lack of know-how.'<br><br>He said although products for wireless access usually come with security features, most require a user to turn them on. However, many do not - with the result that the signals are available to everyone within range.<br><br>Experts say, however, that protecting your network, either from freeloaders or hackers, is easy enough to do.<br><br>A key step to take is to ensure that the identity of your router or other devices is changed from the default - which is usually the device's brand, which also means anyone can gain entry without much trying - to a protected one.<br><br>Other steps include ensuring that firewalls exist and encrypting your data - the latter can be easily achieved by checking that your device offers encryption standards, such as the current Wi-Fi Protected Access.<br><br>This will ensure some measure of security.<br><br>The problem of Wi-Fi freeloaders started with the burgeoning of Wi-Fi hotspots over the last two years - both commercially and domestically.<br><br>In the United States and Britain, debates have arisen over the legality of activities like 'war-driving', where people roam about with their Wi-Fi-enabled devices searching for open wireless access.<br><br>Another popular activity abroad is 'war chalking', where war-drivers mark out areas where free access is available with chalk.<br><br>Such activities are illegal, but detecting if someone else is hopping on board your connection is difficult.<br><br>The signs will not be apparent. Sometimes, the warning will come too late - in the form of an unusually high bill at the end of the month.<br><br>However, if you find that your Internet access speed is unusually slow, that may be a sign that someone is hopping onto your connection.<br><br>For those contemplating such war-driving, technology lawyer Bryan Tan has a warning: 'In Singapore, war-driving may constitute offences under the Computer Misuse Act and the Telecommunications Act, and war-chalking, offences of vandalism and nuisance.<br><br>'One can be fined, imprisoned and even caned for this.'<br><br><strong>How To Protect Yourself</strong><br>WIRELESS security has been enhanced - mainly in terms of encryption technology - over the last two years. The latest security move is the Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) standard that wireless equipment should now bear.<br><br>Another security standard is expected later this year.<br><br>Internet Service Providers are also aware of the need for more security. Said SingTel spokesman Andrienne Tho: 'SingTel is also monitoring developments in Wi-Fi encryption protocols to see how these can be used in our wireless infrastructure.'<br><br>Meanwhile, here are some checks you can make before going wireless:<br><br>Â• Ensure encryption is in place: for now, the WPA standard for wireless transmitters offers a guarantee that your data is secured.<br><br>Â• Change your router's default broadcasted name, also known as the Service Set ID (SSID), as an access point with that pre-set ID indicates an unprotected network. The manual that came with your device should contain instructions on how to do this.<br><br>Â• Set up your Media Access Control (Mac) control list at your access point. This restricts network access to devices whose Mac address - usually a series of numbers - has been given. Again, check your manual for instructions.<br><br>Â• Firewall, especially for your mobile device. Most anti-virus programs come with this feature to block out hackers, such as Trend Micro's PC-cillin.<br><br>Mr Ang Ah Sin, Trend Micro's regional marketing manager, said that its firewall masks your presence so your device and surfing activities cannot be detected by sniffers or hackers.<br><br>Beyond technology, personal vigilance, such as watching out for those watching over your shoulder, helps.</div>
