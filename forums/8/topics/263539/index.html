In the mid-to-late 90s, civil engineering is very popular because of the property and construction boom. To make things more glamours for civil engineers, starting pay for graduates was being published in the newspapers and compared, with civil engineers being the top few bracket. That also make it easier for people to decide.<br><br>The '97 financial crisis did not affect construction sector until 2000-2001 where construction began to experience a laggard and subsequently a downturn. That is when my peers who opted civil enginnering graduated with low paying civil engineering jobs or switched line totally.<br><br>My question to you is will you be sure that the construction boom will be sustainable for the next 5-10 years?<br><br>In terms of the subjects modules, as some forumers has highlighted, 3D mechanics (vector calculus) is more demanding. Some would say civil engineering is easier than the other 2 (Mechanical and ELectrical/Electronics). Let me give you a perspective of all 3 disciplines. My intention is not to conclude which one is easier<br><br>Civil engineering deals with predominately mechanics and if your interest or passion lies in mechanics during your JC days, it will be at an advantage to you. As one forumer has highlighted, CE people are also exposed to the following specialisation:<br><br>- Structural (design of building, bridges, tower etc)<br>- Water (drainage, sewerage system, etc)<br>- Transport and traffic (roads, highway, traffic design etc)<br>- Geotechnical (soil mechanics, foundation, etc) <br><br>For Mechanical engineering, they do a variety of fields, such as thermodynamics, robotics and materials engineering.....as such, their demanding areas will be required to study mechanics as well as some electrical modules<br><br>For electrical engineering, the five main specialisation will be as follows:<br>- Power and Machines<br>- Computing<br>- Communications and Microwave<br>- Control<br>- Microelectronics<br><br>For EE, ththe harder ones will be in the field of electromagnetic fields and waves and Communications related maths (e.g Fourier Transform) and also some Microprocessor Technology (Instructional codes) and Integrated Circuit Design (Silicon Technology)<br><br>Hope you have a rough idea to decide whether civil engineering is for you. The most important I always feel is generally for your first degree, you should pursue what you like to study. I know that you also do not want to graduate without a good prospect/career advancement, but if you generally like what you study, you tend to do well and obtain a good hons. From there, your future employers will have a better impression of you and you may end up in an area totally different from what you study and do it well because you have a proven track record of your studies. Well it also helps if your interest in that field is also easy to score.<br><br>Wishing you the best in your future endeavours in studies as well as career.</div>
