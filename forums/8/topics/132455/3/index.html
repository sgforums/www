It was my ex-boss trying to get me back to work under him.  I didn't take it up due to personal differences between him and me.  We were there at the pub in the evening just after work, so there was no band playing yet.<br><br>The Hyatt Hotel one was about 8 years back.  It was in the afternoon.  This US expat had ended his term and was going back home....and was looking for a local to take over his place (the company wanted to save cost).  I took up this job.  I've known this guy for some time, so when he called, he said "Hey, you wanna take over an expat position?  Then you gotta attend the interview expat style....at the pub". <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>The Eaton Hotel (HK) one was just 4 years back.  It was an interview by a European company.  One of their senior ranks called me while attending an exhibition in Japan.  He said he would be enroute to HK in the next few days before returning to Italy....and asked if by any chance I could meet him in HK.  I checked my frequent flyer mileage, checked with my travel agent who gave me a special rate.....and I said yes.  Total price of trip to HK = S$300. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">   This was the longest interview I had - 11 hours straight.  But it was more like a friendship chat.  I took it up and I'm still in this position today.<br><br></div>

The bosses think the candidates are stupid which in fact the candidates are not. Once get enough experience, will sure leave the company.  SMEs will forever remain as SMEs for this narrow-minded thinking of trying to squeeze every penny worth out of employees. They always forget to count in the opportunity cost of new employees needing time to learn the working system and the real money cost of disgruntled ex-employees bringing customers to their new employers.</div>

I will be sure to ask them back "how do you see my strengths and weaknesses affecting my application?" the next time a hiring company ask me that what's your weakness/strenght question"<br><br>If I know I can' get the job or I am not interested in the job, I will also ask back the interviewer some entertainment questions like "what is the competitive advantage of your company over the competitors?" "Do you see yourself in this current position when you first joined the company? why or why not?" Its really fun to see the interviewers taken aback.<br><br>Can we have some more contributions on what entertaining questions you can ask back the interviewers for them to have a taste of their own medicine?</div>
