            <div class='col-md body'>TO Cluon :,,<br>Thanx for your advise...ya i agreed tht there are many gals who i still don't knoe yet...But with the pples i meet everyday and the pples i knoe..i think i sitll haven;t meet someone who share the things with me so similiar... Ya i shouldn't waste my time on someone i haven;t met b4..But just like when something precious comes..u got to get hold of it else it will not come back again..I think i'm more experience than u in this area..Where BGR..once it goes off,, it won't come back again.. I always believe in trying..even if i failed at least i tried it b4...<br><br>I think u got to think again b4 using this words "imossible to fall in love" ..Well, i have seen afew myself and it really works..and i have experience it myself b4...moreover..did u knoe tht there are many forums in the internet which share experience in all these Cyberlove?? Someeven managed to meet only one or 2 years later...Things tht u think won't happen to u doesn;t mean it won't happen to others.....Impossible is such a strong word..Never use tht unless u are extremely sure..<br><br>Anyway, did i use the word LOVE b4?? I seldom use this word..At most i said i like ...but i can't love someone over the cyber world..i agreed with u tht. Did anyone told u i "love" tht girl? ...Please use the word "love" carefully...<br><br>And how do u knoe i ride a bike in the first place? Guessing? Good guess then....anyway, hoe much u kone abt me? My love life?

            <div class='col-md body'>Patie:<br>dun need to ask dat person i also noe... coz of the post long time ago abt women riding motorbikes... u say u ride wat...<br><br>ya true lah... i tink when it comes to BGR u more experience... what i mean when i say impossible means impossible to love someone u never met before... how can u LOVE someone u dunno rite? of course its not impossible to fall for someone u dunno... but i think its impossible to LOVE... coz LOVE is damn deep... too deep to start a relationship when 2 parties do not noe each other well... dats wat i mean by impossible...<br><br>u have pretty frenz but their char sux?... well, i'm not implyin anything here but how do u noe dat person u like have a REALLY GOOOD character or even one dat suits u? i mean, unless u meet up with her face to face and get to noe her a couple of months, den ok lah... i got personal exp in this area...<br><br>i met this girl over irc 2 weeks before i was suppose to leave for da US. We went out and it was wonderful... i tot she was da one for me man.. she was tall, slim, pretty, sexy, innocent, ... purefect i tot... and when i was in da states, we still kept in touch... i'd sent her lillies and stuffed toys on valentines &amp; xmas... when i went back this winter and i met up with her... she totally changed. She was MUCH different dan the person i met 1 1/2 yrs ago or on da net. I was totally dissappointed in her new behavior and lifestyle... i often chided myself for spending 1 1/2 yrs thinking abt her and stuff... but like u said, if u didn't try u won't noe... so after trying someting like dat, i vow to make sure i'd noe a ger inside out before i fall for her...<br><br>dats why i always want to make frenz with them. I firmly believe dat it will all end good if u guyz are good frenz in da beginning... As frenz, gers dun constantly cloud ur mind and judgement... as frenz, gers dun make u nervous... as frenz, u can still have time to do things with ur guy frenz and its juz more fun...<br><br>only thing dat sux is da time... so juz be patient and go on with ur life... keep in touch with her, coz in da future u never noe... juz take other gers into consideration too and dun block out any potential "mates"... laterz<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Cluon,<br>Happy new year to u ....<br>Like wht i say...don't use the word IMPOSSIBLE just becoz u didn't seems it happened b4...It really happen b4...NOt me alone...mayne couples did really do tht ..Most pples don't believe it doesn't mean it don't have happen...<br><br>WEll, let me ask soemthing to everyone...When a guy meet a girl, they went out and after knoeing for 2 weeks or so( normal case) , they get together and go steady..Wht's the criteria in choosing tht gal ? I'm very sure it's the kind of feeling they have for each other...Whther the feeling last long or short it 's not important.  but the criteria is still the kind of feeling we have....The same apply when u like someone over the net. It ;s the kind of feeling tht matter initially..I'm not sure wht will happen next time..Wht's matter most is noe..Coz nothing is forever..Even diamond can be cut...Wht i wanna say is the feeling...Anyway, i'm lucky all these while where gals in the internet is concern...all those i meet i quite normal ok ...Let hopethe last one will be the same..Anywya, i have been taking risk all these while i don't mind taking the risk for the last time..<br>I'm sad tht u have a bad experience with your IRC friend..I think many of us have this experience too..i can empathy with u..Even my friend told me tht b4...sometime in life we really don't knoe wht will happen to us...so we just to take a risk...Why i wanna take this risk well i think is maybe of my character or maybe i believe in fate...:-)<br><br>WEll ya....It's good being good friend..Well, did i tell u b4 tht i never really expect anything in return where BGR is concern.....i have seen my gal friends telling me their story and personall experience myself.....Well, there are really many gals ard me but hmm..i'm sure i'm old enough to knoe who's the right one rite? :-)<br><br>Anyway, sincerely thanx tht u give me your own opinion..Well i think many pples willalso advise me this way too..But Somehow.. I got to trust in my judgement sometime...Good or bad is my own fate..Thanx anyway.<br>Lastly, wishing u a Happy Chinese New year and enjoy yourself out there..<br><br>B,regards,<br>patie<br><br>"Xing1 Kong1 Chu1 Xian4 Yi4 DAo4 Shu3 Guang1"<br>"DAi4 gei3 ren2 men2 yi4 dian3 xi1 wang4"<br>"Zhi3 Yao4 ba3 Wo4 zhe4 yi4 dian3 shi2 guang1"<br>"Ming2 tian1 jiang1 hui4 Ru2 he2,Bu4 yong4 ni3 Guan3"<br><br>[This message has been edited by patie (edited 05 February 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>very interesting.......juz for the guys:<br><br>Its no use acting cute/handsome! Down here the only way we can shine is to LET PEOPLE KNOW OUR GOOD POINTS. That means doing whatever necessary, like self-introing, holding your principles, and acting like a man. Stalling and thinking too much just isn't to cut it.<br><br>For the galz:<br>give us a chance yeah?
