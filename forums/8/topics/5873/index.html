            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, just decided to write in because i was inspired by the guy who wrote about his lost chance with his friends gal friend at the pub...<br><br>Well, I just wanted to say that I am also quite chicken-shit.  Let's say I like someone(hypothetically)...ok TET, you can stop laffing now...:-)....u know what i mean.<br><br>Anyway back to point.  Let's say i like this girl, and i was thinking very seriously about pursuing her.  But as the god of chicken shit would have it, he struck me with fear and doubt.  Instead of chasing her, I sit at home brooding about it and feeling sorry for myself.  But what makes me so chicken shit is that I believe that this girl DOESN'T like me(at least i think so and I'm usually not wrong here)so I have this apprehension to even start to try.  I mean there is that saying that if you never try you will never know for sure...and know knows she might actually fall for you eventually...<br><br>But my thinking is that if she doesn't like me, then why should I chase her and "force" myself on her to like me...Even if she does like me eventually, I would feel like I forced it to happen and wouldn't feel that she liked me for real anyway.<br><br>So that's one point stopping me from being a hero..haha...<br><br>Besides that i am quite old already and dun feel like getting my heart busted and dissappointed again and again.  At this point in my life, if I like a girl and she doesn't liekme I just say fuck it because I dun have the time or inclination to chase after her and woo her with super flowers and super free time to sit outside waiting for her outside her workplace....As I'm working now, I have very little time for anything in my life...Although I can make time for someone or anyone, I won't if I think that she doesn't like me and I have to chase her to be with me...maybe my thinking is a result of old age...or maybe i just feel old.<br><br>Actually I dun know what I'm saying, but it sure does feel good to let it out....:-)<br><br>I started to try, and If I was younger, maybe I could possibly have done it, but now....nahhh...not possible. DUn have the ability to charm and woo girls anymore..and my ability to take the crash and burn is not so good anymore....Nowadays, one crash and burn and I'm out for weeks...as opposed to before when a few crash and burns in one day could barely faze me....haiz...I guess when people get old, they get gutless and more chicken-shitted.<br><br>It's not for lack of want, but rather more of a lack of strength to face getting turned down again.  Nahhh I think i better not try at all if that's the case...(man, I'm beginning to sound schitzzzooo....)<br><br>Yeah, a totally useless post this one, but you're welcome to comment if you want...but like i said...quite useless...haiz...resigning myself to my fate.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>By 'doesn't like' do you mean not interested or dislikes you? If it's the former, then you should just go express your feelings for her. Better to be rejected straight in the face than to sit at home wondering 'if only' and wallowing in your own self-pity. (Hope I don't sound too harsh, no offense.) Maybe something good might happen.<br><br>I remember when I was a few years younger, I made a fool of myself by asking a girl to be my friend in a crowded bus. Youth makes you do stupid things. Thinking back brings a smile to my face. Perhaps as we get older, we're more afraid to do foolish things as it makes us 'lose face'. But I believe that being spontaneous and not fearful of embarressing yourself is something we all shouldn't forget. At least it will make life easier and happier.<br><br>Just my two cents.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I know that many of you will not believ me when I say that as a person gets more esperienced in life, there is a certain amount that he or she can predict depending on the situation.  While chance is always present, it doesn't always meant hat there may be a chance for you.<br><br>When you have gone through enuff  "things" you will reach a point where you start to see things for what they are instead of what you want them to be.  This is the result of experience and disillusionment in a persons life or road he/she takes.<br><br>There is a limit where a person will pout a blockade and say that enuff is enuff.  There is only so much a person can do before he find out that it ultimately doesn't amount to much.  Like chasing girls.  If it becomes such a difficulty, then give it up...it's not worth it.  If the other perosn doesn't reciprocate then why do it?...You can always say that maybe eventually she might see the light...which may or may not happen.<br><br>My saying is that after you have gone past a point, you realise that you shouldn't go through so much just to gain something like a gf or a wife...if you have to fight so hard for her to like you then it's all for what?<br><br>Again, for me, it is not a matter of prode or ego, but of pain and loss.  How much does a person have to lose ( even if she was never your's the feeling of loss is still present)?...Why is it that the guy must put all his effort into it?...If it was a mutual thing, then both parties should be into the thing.  maybe after all is said and done i still am a romantic at heart(despite my words)...<br><br>I truly belive in love at first site...and also a mutual attration or mutual like or respect.  If there is none present then it's not worth your effort or time.  there are situations where people do fall in love who aren't at all attracted at first to each other...but those are where the situations where these people HAVE to be together for whatever reason or are around each other for an extended amount of time for a reason of what i dun know.<br><br>For the average joe like me and a million other singaporean guys(and i'm not singaporean), we don't have the time to put this klind of energy into wooing girls.  maybe if we did put our effort into it we might get something...But what's the point, we must give up something to gain another thing. At this stage in our lives, survival(especially for a non-local who has no family here)is paramount...If we give up that area, then what for we gain a gf or wife when we can't even support ourselves thru the day to day needs.<br><br>This is where the owmen must come in.  If they are unwilling to then they can go and find another guyt hey like because people like me don't have that amount of time.  As we all know, the wooing stage is very very time consuming and can tawke a lot out of a person emotionally and physically.  Where got that kind of time when you are working 20 hours(literally) days to make ends meet.  But klike I said, I can lmake the time for a gf or wife, but not for wooing...it's a 24 hour process that may last weeks or months.<br><br>Anyway my situation is different from a lot of people's here so it might be hard to understand.<br><br>You can be optimistic and say that there will be someone,. but show that someone to me, because i don't see her (the girl who is willing to try for the guy or at least go half way).<br><br>If she is not willing to go half way to meet you then you know it's pretty pointless even if you end up with her.<br><br>H_KITTY.....hypothetically because i don't want people to know, but saying it in such a way so that people will know but covering my own ass in a really lame way....:-)<br><br>And you don;'t have to worry about being second fiddel or a replacement.  i treat everyone with respect and an equal amount of love and affection(although I give most of that affection to whoever is my gf).  I have never and will never i use anyone to make myself forget someone else....It's not me...i would feel bad for the person to do it.<br><br>SOOOO&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  the offers still stands....besides I told bochup that i would ask someone out that i didn't know.  So what do you say?....kekeke<br><br>Go dinner only what?...I know i not ahbeng ar.....or that guy says it better:<br><br>I may be ugly but i'm gentle...<br><br>kekeke...so the offer still stands...but u have to wait until after CNY because i don;'t get paid until then...hee hee...it's ok lar...dn stress to much ar...can turn me down.:-) :-)<br><br>Besides I been asking you so long already you never give me reply...:-)  you see I told you dun give me so much attitude...I like girls like this man. Actualluy ar...most of my gf always got bad attitudes one...so be scared...be very scared...bwhahaha:-)</div>
