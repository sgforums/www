            <div class='col-md body'>We have heard many times that man, modern society is self centred. We spend money to entertain ourselves and do not care about saving earth resources or welfare of other animals. We also do not care about those living in the Thrid world countries.<br><br>However, we do donate and try to help through charitable efforts but these are occasional helping. Most of our time, the average people and rich people are meddling with our own stuff and thinking of how to be richer.<br><br>I am from middle class and i do not have alot of money. When i work in the future, i could get around 2000 or 3000 but i have no idea of taking out 100 dollars to donate to poor and dying in Africa.<br><br>I believe $100 donation would not affect me that much and i still can have food and shelter. However, to tell u the truth, i have not thought of donating this $100. Yes, i know that because of this choice, a few poor kids has died again.<br><br>Even if i increase the donation to $300, i believe i still can survive relatively ok. The downside is that i will have less saving and if i have emergency cases in the future, then i may not have the money to save myself. However, this is only a small probability right and it has not happen yet. On the other hand, the kids in poor countries are dying pretty sure if aid is not arrived.<br><br>The children and the weak is also at risk of being enslaved and captured by criminals in their countries if aid is not issued. All these is certainly happening while i am saving money for a possible emergency that may arise in the future.<br><br>After writing so much for these poor people, i still have not decided to donate money of few hundred bucks out of my salary. Is it right for those, like me, and probably most of population to save money for ourselves? Ok, lets not say few hundred bucks. Just $50 ok per month.<br><br>Is selfishness ok? Seriously, i tell you, i know that there are thousands of kids and poor adult who are moaning in pain and being beaten right now in the world while i am studying for exam. As it is not my body that is in pain, i do not really care that they are beaten and suffering and I am not taking any action to try to stop this common events. My mind will still be about finding a job and thinking how to chase a girl.<br><br>This is selfishness, or self centredness whatever you call it. However, i think we selfish people should still help people in the end. Especially in coming up with good ideas to help solve problems. Fund raising efforts are good but not efficient enough. The key that we selfish people can do is to come up with good ideas, ideas that will spread like wind and truly help the disadvantage people. I know we are lazy people and want to enjoy for ourselves but i think there is more we can contribute while still listening to Jay chou music.</div>

They helped those in the vicinity of their location and kudos for them for helping the poor.<br><br>However, they have not come up with ideas to solve the poverty, weak plight. The issue of resources wastage and animal welfare remains debatable.<br><br>I think Bill Gates foundation and other foundation and charities has probably help alleivate more suffering by providing more actions that praying Buddhists.<br>They have to come up with programs, logistics plan to really push the action of helping the unfortunate.<br><br>Buddhism still has alot to learn and should really step out of the temples more often. They can learn more by living in the real world. It still has alot of improvement to make. They have to increase their technology, hard science and resource managment.<br><br>Tibet monks are still in the era of deciding who is the real Dalai Lama. This is quiet outdated thinking. I do not deny Buddhism has a few useful teachings about life though. i was inspired by it a while before but have also moved on to other subjects other that Buddhism.</div>
