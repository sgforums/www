            <div class='col-md body'>1st of all, not thinking of good ideas to help the poverty and sufferings in third world country is because we are not affected by it.<br><br>It may sound cold, but how much do we know about it? at most from superficial news reports. Do we even know whether our donation reaches them, reports always say millions of dollars of donations being made but how come news reports them not even getting enough food, not even instant noodles?<br><br>Before you help others, you have to first secure yourself. I don't think it's selfish of us to think of the many things that are gonna affect ourselves, like studies, work and family etc.<br><br>Bill Gates' rich man, as a matter of fact that's an understatement. Hence, he's already past the stage whereby you worry about studying for a better future as well as getting a decent job for stable income. Then he can allow time and effort to help the needies which he did.<br><br>For many of us commoners, we just don't have that kind of luxury. We have immediate day-to-day issues of our own to solve.<br><br>Now, on to the ideas of helping the needies. Monetary is not an efficient channel as we all can see despite all these years, the situations remains the same.<br><br>So, how to help? The only solution is purification of human soul *nothing occultish* when there are no more oppressors, there would be no more oppressed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Frankly speaking, i'm not in tuned with what's really happening on the other side of the world. Call it apathy which we all embody, but i try to help the needy along the way whenever i can. Humans make mistakes and one of those mistakes is closing both your eyes on a needy who's just beside you. So if i change a lil' bit for the better and if you do the same as well, the world would eventually change. Having said that, we cannot disregard the fact that if one does not have even a small fraction of greediness, hatred and jealousy, he would have had gained enlightenment.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TS started a very interesting topic, well done haha.. set me thinking. anyway i would like to quote this old chinese saying " you qian chu qian, you li chu li " . It translates roughly to: if you have money, donate money. No money, help out physically also good. If ur kind and good and would like to do ur part for society.. donate money if ur rich. if u arent do community service. While you donating a significant percentage of your salary is commendable, i believe all charities would rather a millionaire donating; even a percentage of his wealth; to them. Just donate within your means, if you have have a genuine heart you would know how much you can afford to donate and not agonise about your material comforts after donating a portion of your salary away.<br><br>Me myself i wouldnt be able to donate a sizable portion of my wealth la, not unless im actually managing how my money is being utilised to help the needy. Simply because i cant bring myself to trust the people running the charities ( they're people afterall, corruptable and bound to have some black sheep amongst them ) .. My approach would be to help out.. senior citizens centre bla bla.. i dont like to just donate money to assuage my conscience when i see a pitiful person on the charity show. Im not saying people shouldnt donate. donating is good, but all the same i would rather leave the money aspect to other people to handle. donating money to me is like.. buying a sou's worth of paradise.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>THere is totally nothing wrong with being selfish, and i'm sure alot of people will agree when they start to remove all those negative connotations associated with the word and begin to understand what it means.<br><br>Don't forget that everything we have and enjoy here, is because of a selfish economic system: capitalism. Without it we'd still be living in the pre-industrial ages.<br><br>To quote a passage from my favorite author Nathaniel Branden:<br><br>"One of the greatest causes of suffering on this planet is poverty. It follows, therefore, that if one is genuinely interested in relieving suffering and is disposed to approach the problem consciously, one would wish to understand how poverty is eliminated. Fortunately, the answer is known.<br><br>Prior to the industrial revolution and the birth of capitalism, poverty was the natural condition of almost all of the human race. It was not perceived as an aberration but as the norm. Ninety-eight percent of the worldÂ’s population lived in conditions unimaginable to a twentieth century citizen of the United States. That was poverty of a kind that makes what we call poverty today look like luxury. Then, dating from the time of the American Revolution, the ideas of individualism, human rights, and political-economic freedomÂ—capitalismÂ—began to sweep the Western world. To the extent that capitalism was accepted, which varied enormously from country to country, the result was an unprecedented rise in the standard of living of millions and millions of people that would have been inconceivable a century earlier. Infant mortality rates dropped and life expectancy leapt upward. In the brief span of less than two hundred years the West witnessed a growth in material well-being unequaled by the sum of human progress up to that time. At every step of the way, the freer the country was, the faster the rate of progress and the more rapid the decline of poverty."<br><br>If you understand this you wouldnt preach selflessness when it is essentially selfishness that helped lifted so many millions from poverty in the first place</div>
