            <div class='col-md body'>10, Nov 2005 Thursday<br><br>Two days ago, I found my long lost Â“Dream talismanÂ” while searching for my mobile phone warranty. It was hiding inside my book. Wow!! My heart race, I can have super dreams again.  Night comes, all prepare for my Â“Dreams AdventuresÂ”. As old time usual, I set my bed, place my Â“Dreaming TalismanÂ” under my pillow. Excited, I went to sleep.<br><br>To my disappointment, day-light came. Open my eyes to see my alarm clock. 7:26am!! Not a single dream experience!? Why? I jumped. I turned my pillow, oops Â“Dreaming TalismanÂ” have been push &amp; drop into floor. SighÂ…. A night wasted. Dreaming Talisman went back for safe keeping first. Time for my day duty liao.<br><br>11, Nov 2005 Friday<br><br>Kekekeke, tonight I am well prepared. Night came Â… 11:10pm. I reach for Â“Dreaming TalismanÂ”. Holding it softly with both my hands. I told it Â“Tonight I want to dream.Â” Silently Â… I felt peace. In my heart a message crawl back to me. Â“Get some good rest, let the Adventure unfold.Â” I know deeply, tonight itÂ’s my exciting nightÂ…. Wow.<br><br>I place Â“Dreaming TalismanÂ” neatly under my pillow. I make sure itÂ’s center. This time wonÂ’t fall off liao. Happy as I went, sleep. It was the usual routine, turning a few times adjusting myself &amp; I was fast asleep.<br><br>I was in a wooden boat. On the starboard side. Sea was calm, light breeze welcoming me. There was about 5~6 crew member on-board where I could see. They were busy. I was in the middle of some middle-Arabic sea. The sea-water was crystal clear. The sea bed was light brown. Not so much sand but flat stone sea bed. Sea water was just at most 10 feet. Small fishes dart thru the calm water. I feel peace &amp; excited. Where this boat going to bring me?<br><br>Not long, one of the crew member shorted Â“Look, under-water!!Â” Pointing to 100 feet away star-board side from our boat. There were 2 ships parked beside. We slow cruise to them. Â“Anchor down!Â” Safely our boat was parked next to one of the boat. Ropes fly between boats. Both crews start working unloading stuff to the bigger boat. Then I understand our boat is bring supply to these two other boats.<br><br>Upon closer looks, this team are doing under water filming. Some kind of lightings &amp; filming equipments are place under-water on the flat stone sea bed. At least 8 people are in the 10 ft water. I was approached by one of the bigger boatÂ’s captain. Â“Do you want to see how we do it?Â” My reply Â“Wow, I love to. Load me up for an experience.Â”<br><br>Soon I was breathing in the water. Flapping my flappers I approached slowly behind the main video camera. There were 3 other people controlling it. Stabilizing it. By under-water walkie talkie I question Â“What is this about?Â” One of them answered Â“Filming under-water! Sorry the film is going to run we have to concentrate.Â”<br><br>I saw a man wear suits in water &amp; a women in long white dress. Seems like a under-water marriage scene going on. Some guy reply Â“Watch &amp; see!!Â” Â“Okie!!Â” I answered. My eyes concentrated onto the video screen behind the taking camera. Both are dancing in water, women are smiling pretty towards the men. Strong feelings on one else were there to celebrate their wedding, but their joy of this union have over come all of that.<br><br>Suddenly the bridegroom was catching his breath in the water. His hands tries to reach for her. She was just smiling. Something was amiss here. He realized now. He push himself forward under that 10ft water. Stretching his hands to reach for his love. He tries to touch her beautiful face. Shock him, her face melts away like white cream in water from his bear hands. I was shock. Someone shouted over the walkie talkie Â“The filming of Â“Underwater Ghost story of the middle Arabic Sea! Scarely?Â”<br><br>I woke up from shock. Thanks to my Â“Dreaming TalismanÂ” had brought me an unexpected experience.  It was only 5:50am. I still have some time before day duty. Better get some more sleep.<br><br>Wow Â… it goes again. Asleep, I am dreaming again!! This time I am just the spectator only. SighÂ…. This European looking lady with long dark brown hair in Scottish dressing. She was dating her young looking boyfriend. She is very happy with him &amp; wanted him to be her husband. I could not understand what they speak. Could feel they are in love. There was just in her heart, he may still have other relationships which she suspected. She discussed this with a close friend. Was told she can do an old Scottish magic to Â“SEEÂ” her boyfriendÂ’s back.<br><br>They went to prepare their Â“MagicÂ”. It was a doll. Wooden doll with rolling eyes. Her friend told her Â“I could teach you to cast the spell. What the doll sees, you see. What the doll felt, you felt also.Â” She replied Â“ThatÂ’s great, I could keep both eyes on him now.Â” They went to the close friendÂ’s house, to prepare the BIG THING. There was potions, burning of plants &amp; lastly dripping little blood &amp; prepared fluid into the dolls eyes. Â“Now, bring this to your man, when you want to Â‘seeÂ’ chant this verse.Â” Handed a little piece of paper to her. Â“Then you will only see &amp; feel what the doll has, but you cannot control the doll at all. Stop chanting a while &amp; your vision &amp; feelings comes back normal.Â” Â“Thank you very much my friend.Â” Â“Take care, I am pretty tried. I need to rest.Â” Off the lady happily went home.<br><br>The Â“DollÂ” was presented to the boyfriend. She insisted him to place it near his bed &amp; never touch it. He feels strange, ask Â“Why the sudden a doll?Â” Â“It reminds you of me always.Â” Â“Okie, Okie. Near my bed.Â”  Two days later, she decided to try. Since boyfriend was at home now, it should have a nice chance to Â‘SeeÂ’. She went into her own room, sitting on bed. Took out the paper &amp; started chanting. Her current vision started to blur off. Distant off. She was afraid of such strange experience but she hold on. Then slowly vision starts to come back. At first it was not so clear. She could make out the outline it was her boyfriendÂ’s bed room. Her boyfriend seems to be doing something on bed. She swipe her eye ball around to see more. It was clearer each time. WowÂ… the Â“DollÂ” worked! As her vision becomes clearer she have another shock. Her boyfriend was half naked. There was a female also half naked in his bed!! She stare fiercely towards them. This act also make the DollÂ’s eyes stare towards them. Boyfriend turned &amp; feeling uneasy about the doll. Looking at the doll where the eyes looks strangely fierce today. Â“Just how come the doll look fierce only today?Â” The female answered Â“Close the dollÂ’s eyes, I feel uneasy.Â” Guilt came up to the man. The doll was from his girlfriend to remind him of her. Â“Yup, better close itÂ’s eyes.Â” He took the doll which was wide open eyes still staring. Using both thumbs push both eyes socket inwards. He push in hard. The girlfriend in the bed room scream in dear pain. Trying to protect her eyes, it was no use. Both eye ball was pushed deeply into her brain. Blood flows, both her eyes was crushed.<br><br>Ringing Â… Ringing. My alarm knock me off. Wow Â… My Â“Dreaming TalismanÂ” did it again!! Two times experience in a night. I woke up feeling much tried. Sleep was shorten. Think donÂ’t do my Dreaming Talisman too often else cannot concentrate at work liao. WhatÂ’s my diet today? Full-Cream Milk?!?!<br></div>
