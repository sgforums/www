Correct. Charge for all changes hahahaha...... maybe it is better to get a talented employee then do outsourcing but the problem faced by employers is how to land that so called talented employee? Nowadays vendor try to keep their best to their side henceby deprive other companies and then they LL have to engage the vendor to do the job for them  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>It is the employees that make a company. Company alone without talent is nothing..... tat is why there is talent scouting going on throughout all industries.... heard M$ has a fulltime job just to do talent scouting and then lure those potential employee of their current employer and join the redmond gang hahaha  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> [/b]</blockquote>No leh.. company outsource cos it's the trend. And also, on paper they feel that it can save them money as they do not have to pay for benefit, salary, allowance and less management etc. But they are not looking at the consequences. Employees, for the sake of establishing their careers, they would want to perform. Whereas, vendors are a one-time thingy and even if they are the best, they are not showing (overloaded/not enough time to show?)<br>When management convinced us of outsourcing, the rationale was to reduce the amount of menial work, so that we can concentrate on "higher" level thinking. But ultimately we end up doing double jobs.<br><br>Hopefully, can find an ideal job or strike it rich soon...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
