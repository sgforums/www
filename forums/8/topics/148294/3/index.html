But organizations are different from consumers.<br><br>There are certain learnings that organizations need to keep and maintain.  Outsourcing, if determined by cost, might not do much good. For instance, IT, some companies left everything to the outsourcing company. (e.g. inventory control, licensing etc). At the end of the day, the outsourcing company(if unprofessional) will not be bothered with the up keeping of records. Same for marketing. If the task is entirely outsourced for a certain period, each vendor advises differently. Eventually a company would be experiencing lots of changes but where is it heading?<br><br>Having a hard time managing vendors because they keep charging at every small thing. Also, they tend not to spend time understanding business objectives but have the do-and go attitude. They dun really care if they have made a mess out of it while the one managing them would have to pick the bits and pieces... shang nao jing<br><br>Which jobs are indispensible? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

At the end of the day, the outsourcing company(if unprofessional) will not be bothered with the up keeping of records. Same for marketing.

Correct. Charge for all changes hahahaha...... maybe it is better to get a talented employee then do outsourcing but the problem faced by employers is how to land that so called talented employee? Nowadays vendor try to keep their best to their side henceby deprive other companies and then they LL have to engage the vendor to do the job for them  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>It is the employees that make a company.
