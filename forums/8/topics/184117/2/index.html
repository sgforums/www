They only want to increae their post counts.<br><br>Anyway, i know what you feel like cos i'm going through the same thing. After ahwile it gets a lil boring becos you just want to hang around wif your friend and not their bf/gf.<br>I have a similar situation, my friend brings his gf along to our late nite outings but never informs me. Why does he have to inform me in advance? Becos i end up have to send each of them home and his gf lives far away from our houses. So naturally i feel a lil irritated. Anyways i don't know how to help you as i also can't help myself. I just have to be happy for my friend and his gf and not provoke any war among us. LEast we still got the friendship. IF these types of people get bored of our friendship and constantly stick to their gf/bf then they really need to get a reality check.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think its perfectly okay to tell your friend you wish to meet for some 'girl-time' can or not? I think she will feel touched that you value the time spent with her ALONE and not with another tag along.<br><br>When my friends and I meet, we will either check with each other if the partners are going, occasionally warn and apologise if our partner is REALLy free and nothing to do and wish to tag along, OR make it very clear its a 'no partners event' Even now that we're mostly all married, if a friend needs time for GIRL talk, she tells me, and I tell the hubby it's a NO-HUSBY-OUTING. And he just needs to entertain himself. Same thing, if hubby goes for his malebonding thing, unless he specifically asks me, it simply isn't nice for me to tag along.<br><br>And as for those people who ask her to 'get a bf', i think it is probably coming from people who totally don't have this problem because they tag along with their partner all the time (Or think it is shiok to have their partner be someone with no life and always want to tag along) cos that isnt the issue at ALL.<br><br></div>
