            <div class='col-md body'><br>Its often a fact that these perpetrators KNOW they can get away and no one will stop them that they commit crimes like this. This is China and it is somehow always given me the impression that a life of any person is worth less than dirt. So some one said they target tourist which follows that these tourist might not have the time to see justice be done. Or they target certain women who are unable to bring justice to these men.<br><br>The other day I was watching some show. It said that 30-40% of men would violently rape a women if he knows he can get away with it. Its a high percentage already and I guess its higher when there are no social sanctions or pressures or even just people who care enough to take action.  Weapons of mass destruction - is not those big nuclear warheads, but inaction, greed, lust, slovenly, racism and etc<br><br></div>
