Urghh.. I told my dad some facts like what you said up there and in the end kena scolding.. Keep saying got proof then talk.. Have to help him do the donation calls oso!! Felt so disgusted!!! He even insisted that I shld donate a bit of money to them monthly when I work.. I said I rather give more to SPCA or CWS.. Siao one.. He made 6 calls already.. Imagine that money goes to SPCA or CWS, how much it'd be a help to them? 30bucks can buy a big pack of cat food(3kg) already!! Can eat quite long for a cat leh!! Plus he donate 10bucks to them monthly! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>I'll try to ask him not to donate monthly see how.. Urgh!! Really wanna show him what u experience, but really hard to ask him dun donate -_-<br><br>I last time used to make 2 calls or what to them.. But that time they called me ask me to help them by collecting a donation card from them and get ppl to donate!! PUI! I was abt to go out that day.. I said I dun wan already keep "fan" me.. Felt really disgusted by that act leh.. 2yrs since I  left sec sch liao still can track number to call..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>
