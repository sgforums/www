              recanting a sensational statement connecting now-Prime Minister Najib
              Tun Razak to the murder of a Mongolian translator, has surfaced to
              reaffirm his allegations and to say he had been offered a RM5 million
              (US$1.48 million) bribe to disappear by a businessman said to be
              connected to Najib's wife, Rosmah Mansor.<br> <br> The attractive translator, Altantuya Shaariibuu, was murdered by two of
              Najib's elite bodyguards in October of 2006 in a particularly gruesome
              fashion. After she was shot twice in the head, her body was blown up
              with C4 military explosives. Any indication that she and two friends
              had entered <a class="lingo_link" style="border-bottom: 1px dotted; color: blue; text-decoration: none; cursor: pointer; display: inline; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal;" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=974&amp;Itemid=178">Malaysia</a> disappeared from the immigration department's records. <br> <br> The statement by the private detective, P Balasubramaniam, in a YouTube
              video, appeared on Malaysia Today, the website run by Malaysian
              journalist Raja Petra Kamaruddin, who promised far more startling
              episodes in the near future. As many as five segments, accounting for
              20 minutes of revelations, remain to be aired, he said in an email to
              Asia Sentinel. The first segment can be <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN7qsSQoRBY&amp;feature=player_embedded#">found here</a>.<br> <br> Balasubramaniam said in his original statutory declaration that he had
              been hired by Abdul Razak Baginda, one of Najib's closest friends, to
              protect him from the wrath of Altantuya after he had jilted her. Razak
              Baginda was originally charged with the murder along with Najib's
              bodyguards but was acquitted without having to put on a defense.<br> <br> In the 90-second video, Balasubramaniam said he had met with the
              businessman, Deepak Jaikshnan, the director of a carpet firm, in a <em>bak ku teh</em> (pork rib soup) restaurant in the Rawang* suburb where he lived, in
              which the businessman offered him the money. In an accompanying story
              in Malaysia Today, Raja Petra displayed photocopies of RM50,000 checks
              on Public Bank of Malaysia made out by Deepak Jaikshnan. Although no
              indication was given of where Balasubramaniam is now, other sources say
              he may be in <a class="lingo_link" style="border-bottom: 1px dotted; color: blue; text-decoration: none; cursor: pointer; display: inline; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal;" rel="nofollow" href="http://asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=476&amp;Itemid=34">India.</a> In the videotape, he was said to be in the company of three Malaysian lawyers. <br> <br> Almost immediately on giving his original statement tying Najib to
              Altantuya in the company of his lawyer and opposition leader Anwar
              Ibrahim, the private investigator was hustled to a <a class="lingo_link" style="border-bottom: 1px dotted; color: blue; text-decoration: none; cursor: pointer; display: inline; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal;" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1331&amp;Itemid=31">Kuala Lumpur</a> police station where he wholly and completely recanted the original,
              saying he had been coerced into making it by Anwar and others. Then he
              and his family disappeared. He had not been heard from since. <br> <br> In his original statement, Balasubramaniam said he was making it
              because of his "disappointment at the standard of investigations
              conducted by the authorities into the circumstances surrounding the
              murder of Altantuya Shaariibuu." He wrote that he wanted the "relevant
              authorities to reopen their investigations into this case immediately
              so that any fresh evidence may be presented to the Court prior to
              submissions at the end of the prosecutions [sic] case." <br> <br> According to letters found after Altantuya was murdered, she was
              attempting to blackmail the married Razak Baginda for US$500,000 after
              he had broken off their affair after spending thousands of dollars on
              her. The two bodyguards, Corporal Sirul Azhar Umar and his boss, Chief
              Inspector Azilah Hadri, were convicted of the murder and have been
              sentenced to hang. They are currently appealing the sentence. Sirul
              confessed to the murder, although the confession was never allowed into
              evidence in the trial, and said the two had been offered RM100,000 to
              kill the woman. <br> <br> The marathon trial was notable for the extensive lengths the defense,
              prosecution and judge all went to in a bid to keep Najib's name out of
              it. Although Razak Baginda, in a cautioned statement, said he had gone
              to Musa Safri, Najib's chief of staff, to ask for help in keeping
              Altantuya away from him, neither Musa Safri nor Najib was ever called
              to give evidence or appear in court. Razak Baginda almost immediately
              left the country for England after his acquittal. The two bodyguards
              have rarely been seen in public. When they are produced, their heads
              are usually covered, leading cynics to speculate that when it comes
              time to hang them, some other luckless criminals might be forced to
              substitute for them.<br> <br> The private investigator said in 2008 that he had had extensive
              conversations with Razak Baginda in the days leading up to Altantuya's
              death in which he was told she had been introduced to Razak Baginda at
              a diamond exhibition in Singapore and that she had been handed off to
              him to look after her because Najib "did not want her to harass him
              since he was now the deputy prime minister." <br> <br> It should be noted that on occasion Malaysia Today has been
              spectacularly wrong. At one point the website said Rosmah Mansor had
              been present at Altantuya's murder, although Sirul's confession made no
              mention of her and no other evidence has emerged to indicate she had
              been in the jungle clearing where the translator died.  He has also
              delivered sensational reports that have been verified.<br> <br> In the story on the website on the same day the YouTube video appeared,
              Raja Petra recalled that he had been having lunch with Balasubramaniam
              when the private detective received a call saying a police supervisor
              named Suresh was telephoning him to tell him his family's security was
              at stake. After he had repudiated his statement, according to Raja
              Petra, he was whisked to India and hidden. Balasubramaniam, Raja Petra
              wrote, had no choice but to accept the RM50,000 a month and
              "retirement' in India or suffer the same fate as Altantuya. <br> <br> "Little did they know that Bala was just biding his time, waiting for
              the right moment to strike back. And now he is striking back and has
              come out to reveal what really happened since the time he signed his
              first Statutory Declaration, followed by the second one the following
              day, 16 months ago," Raja Petra wrote. <br> <br> The Altantuya murder, with its long-rumored ties to Najib, has had the
              potential to blow up into one of Malaysia's biggest scandals ever since
              the time the woman's body was found near a suburb of Kuala Lumpur. In
              his original declaration, Balasubramaniam said he had been told by
              Razak Baginda that the woman wanted the US$500,000 apparently as a
              commission owed to her from "a deal in Paris." The document also
              purported to confirm long-reported rumors that Najib, Razak and
              Altantuya had been at a dinner in Paris during the time when the
              submarine transaction was being negotiated. During the trial, a cousin
              of Altantuya's said she had seen a picture of the three at dinner, but
              the prosecution and defense both refused to take the matter further. <br> <br> That deal was the purchase by the Malaysian government of three
              submarines at a cost of US$1 billion. According to testimony in
              Malaysia's parliament, a company controlled by Razak Baginda received a
              €117 "commission" for the purchase of the submarines from the French
              military. Interestingly, in late October the son of the late French
              President Francois Mitterrand and a former minister were convicted of
              taking bribes relating to the sale of a huge amount of arms to the
              government of Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos between 1993 and
              1998 in defiance of a United Nations arms embargo. Some 42 persons were
              accused of selling weapons to the Angolans. Despite calls to have Paris
              look into the Malaysian submarine transactions for possible evidence of
              corruption, no action has been taken and it appears unlikely that it
              will be.<br> <br> <strong>See also: </strong><br> <a class="countrysect" href="http://asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1780&amp;Itemid=178">The Confession that Never Was</a><br> <a class="countrysect" href="http://asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1840&amp;Itemid=199">Questions for Najib over a Missing Model</a><br> <a class="countrysect" href="http://asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1813&amp;Itemid=178">Altantuya's Killers Judged Guilty</a><br> <br> <br> Correction.
