            <div class='col-md body'>millennium, you asked for figures. Have you looked them up yourself? Anyway, here they are.<br><br>Average crew complement for each ship type :<br>Nimitz-class CVN - 5000<br>Ticonderoga-class CG - 380-387<br>Arleigh Burke-class DDG - 320-380<br>Spruance-class DD - 320-350<br><br>Yes, we can man one or perhaps even a few of these smaller ships like I've mentioned before, at a very high price, of course. There'd be no lack of volunteers for such plum assignments, but it makes no practical sense to do so. These ships perform functions we do not need, now or in the near future.<br><br>I don't believe I need to elaborate on the profound lack of need for an aircraft carrier. The CG and DDG basically serve as guardians of the fleet, usually centered around a carrier, which we don't have. Their weapons systems are specifically designed to counter MASSED air and missile attacks, both of which our neighbours aren't capable of. They are also platforms for Tomahawk missile launchers, which we don't need, to say the least. Finally, the Harpoon and anti-submarine roles can be filled by our small fleet, not to the same extent that these ships can, but nonetheless more than adequate for our needs. Anything else I missed?<br><br>As mentioned earlier both by myself and Mr Hata-san, costs are astronomical. Maintenance on a squadron of these ships, weapons systems upgrades, R&amp;D, plus technical staff expertise all cost a bomb. We are talking tens of billions at the outset, with plenty more to follow in successive years. At such costs, there's got to be a compelling justification for the purchase. I can find none.<br><br>If we're just going to have a huge cruiser bristling with weapons patrolling the Straits of Singapore, then it looks plain stupid. Until the day when Singapore decides to spend a significant chunk of its reserves to flex its naval muscles in the world, we'd do just fine with our existing fleet.<br><br>Why the need for submarines? Perhaps we are moving towards blue-water fleet capability as Mr Hata-san has suggested. Also, consider what submarines can do that surface ships can't...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>btw, there are 3 real threats near to our homeland they are :<br><br>a.  Malaysia (a designed war is unlikely but an accidental one is possible)<br><br>b.  Indonesia (if it splits into many small countries each controlled by a warlord, we can't be sure if they will attack us)<br><br>c.  North Korea (this is not a direct threat yet, but its military force is too strong ...)<br><br>wat do you guys think ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm, terrorism here seems to be perceived as an external force applied, hence the arms race discussion. what about hostile forces that have already inflitrated s'pore borders?<br><br>the influx of foreign talent and labour has effectively blown open the doors for behind the lines terrorism. and while immigration conducts as stringent checks as possible the high levels of human and information traffic allow a slow build up of alien resources to launch terrorist attacks in a few years time. terrorism after all is not mere violent but civil and ideological conflict.<br><br>a hypothetical scenario. after years of accumulating foreign labourers of a particular country, a seizable number of agent provocateurs are amassed. circulating information amongst themselves, upon diplomatic breakdown with their country, these agents have proximity to our water circulation, power supply, transportation and children in schools. with internal chaos, the police and army is called into action, thus drawing attention away from border scrutiny. our defenses weaken, the aggressor country sends in wave after wave of attacks from the sea and down m'sia with JB as launch pad. we become eroded from within and without.<br><br>foreign talent at middle and higher management positions also may be sleepers planted. activated, they have the means and know how to reconfigure informative messages just prior to declarations of conflict in order to weaken and cause chaos within.<br><br>cheerio<br><br>------------------<br>It is true that liberty is precious - so precious it must be carefully rationed.<br><br>V.

            <div class='col-md body'>To Quisling:<br><br>After looking at the figure, do you still think that there is no lack of manpower? Viva is correct, RSN do not even have 5000 people and you still think we got no problem running a few?<br><br>Looks like you only thinking of now and not in the future. Ok, never mind thats your opinion. No point arguing over that. Further more I am not saying that we must die die buy Aircraft Carrier (if you got read me previous posting), please do not misunderstand my point.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>millennium, it's not all that difficult to raise a crew, if the ship is necessary. So what if the RSN is only 5000-strong?

Manning one or two is possible, more than that would be stretching it.<br><br>In addition, I believe I've already presented a number of reasons why we don't need those large warships.
