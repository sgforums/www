            <div class='col-md body'>It really start to make me wonder where to get 5000 people to run an Aircraft Carrier? Interested to know where to get 5000 people if, I say again, IF (must stress the word if, if not someone would say I suggest to buy Aircraft Carrier again), we were to buy an Aircraft Carrier now?<br><br>As for the reason I think not suitable for Aircraft Carrier fleet is because we do not have the manpower to run the fleet. As you already mention, Aircraft Carrier do not travel alone. Usually accompany by the Carrier fleet. Where do a small country find so much of manpower to run a large fleet. I do not agree your reason we do not need Aircraft Carrier, different class of warship have different mission and purpose. Aircraft Carrier also have their own function.<br><br>Lastly I must stress again, I DO NOT  support buying Aircraft Carrier.</div>

Malaysia (a designed war is unlikely but an accidental one is possible)<br><br>b.  Indonesia (if it splits into many small countries each controlled by a warlord, we can't be sure if they will attack us)<br><br>c.  North Korea (this is not a direct threat yet, but its military force is too strong ...)<br><br>wat do you guys think ?</div></blockquote>my thoughts???<br>a. yes yes, we can't denied that they are our closest neighbour and potential enemy.However,i have trust in our Foreign Affairs Dept. and their close ties with their counterpart over in K.L. Cooler heads should prevail despite the  rhetorics the politicians loved to expoused.<br><br>b. Yes, i would agree this is our worst nightmare, our southern neighbour splitting into numerous small countries. Beside the warlord factor u just mentioned, the problem of refugees and regional instability is enough to scared off all our investors.<br><br>c. I can't see North Korea posing a direct threat to us. As regarding their military capabilities, they are not highly regarded.<br>First of all, most of their aids came from thier socialist partners like the now defunct Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China back in the 60s to late 80s. However, that was to change with the end of the Cold War. Soviet Union dismantled and the PRC is all but capitalist in name. With technological stagnation for close to a decade, it will be sucidal if they decides to have any military adventure with her neighbours.<br>Another minor point which i need to raise is their troops fighting ability. It is no secret that N.Korea have been facing famines for a long time. This will directly affect their troops morale and capability to fight. Futhermore, how can they substained a long battle when their next meal is in doubt?<br><br>A good example of their military might is the skirmish that happened between their navy and S.Korean navy in 1999. They suffered horrendous lossses while the S.Korean navy vessels does not even had a scratch on their warpaint.<br><br>cheers<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>millennium, I believe I've already stated unequivocally from my earliest posts that we can man a destroyer or two, or even a cruiser. At no point in time did I suggest the same possibility for an aircraft carrier. I find it quite extraordinary that you could misinterpret my words time and again. Do read again, CAREFULLY this time, and refrain from putting words into my mouth. The whole question about the aircraft carrier is pointless. I was referring wholly to the other vessels mentioned.<br><br>You have just stated that you disagree with me as to why we do not need a CV. Kindly justify your stand or this whole discussion halts right here. Let me pose some specific questions to you, in case you miss my point yet again :<br><br>1. What special functions do an aircraft carrier serve?<br><br>2. Why do we require these functions, now or in the foreseeable future?<br><br>3. For that matter, what special functions do the CG, DDG or DD serve that we require, now or in the foreseeable future?<br><br>4. Refer to your previous statement that I have not thought of the future. What is it about the future that will compel us to acquire these vessels?<br><br>[This message has been edited by Quisling (edited 26 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Too add on to Mr Hata-san's post,<br><br>North Korea is, in any case, too far away to be a plausible threat. Boxed in by Russia, China, South Korea and Japan, not to mention a heavy US military presence in the area, it doubtful at best that they'd have much success with their numerically strong but technologically decrepit military.<br><br>Malaysia poses a greater military threat as compared to Indonesia, where the spectre of a refugee exodus is a nightmare for us. In a pure clash of arms, however, our defence forces are designed to take on both countries simultaneously (or even more...). Our military spending is by no coincidence the highest in the region.</div>

For one thing, technological advancement in military appliances evolves like predator and prey. They call this The Red Queen phenomenon. Submarines might have the edge in stealth, but please remember, anti-submarine vessels are constantly upgrading their capabilities to counter their main threat.This is a constant battle and supremacy belongs to the better humans piloting these machines of mass  destruction.<br><br>We are know that SG is a maritime nation.We are heavily dependent on trade and any threat to our trade routes in South China Sea and Malacca Straits directly threatened our national security.Having submarines in our RSN does not mean merely "attacking" surface vessels.Beside the recon role of monitoring the ships (as well as submarines) passing thru our waters, the sub. can also take on the active role of hunter...that is, the hunting of fellow submarines.<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>quisling, I had enjoy my Sunday, now time for me to answer your question.<br><br>1) Aircraft Carrier as the name mention, to act as a platform for air strike and air defence. Aircraft Carrier usually act as a command ship for commander to do commanding during war time.<br><br>2) In US, naval commander do their commanding in the sea so as to understand the situation better. In Singapore, we do not have a command ship, during war time, commander do their commanding in underground. Do you expect to win when the commander is not in real time situation?<br><br>3) As for Dsestroyer, Crusier and Frigate, I need not need to elborate much, you had already mention them.<br>Destroyer: Attack sea and surface contact, factorise stealth application with primary aim of providing precise targeting long range in support of land operation.<br>Crusier: Attack sea, surface and best in air defence, Crusier is active in directing air defence and land attack. Due to this advantage, they are usually nearest to the commanding ship when travelling in formation.<br>Frigate: Use to block missile. It has the fastest speed in the Carrier fleet, therefore Frigate usually travel first and last in the fleet. It is also used to block missile if it is unavoidable.<br><br>4) So do you think we can win a naval warfare with our currect fleet. How do you think of our RSN elite force Victory Class Missile Convetter Vessel and our coming new Stealth Frigate? You think with these Frigate we can win a war? If you answer is yes, sorry to tell you mine answer is definitely no. So how you think about our Submarine? Don't forget the new Submarine is convectional diesel Submarine and not nuclear Submarine. Never underestimate the strength of our enermy. Our neighbour is not as lousy as we think.<br><br>Hope I had answer your question to your satifactory. From the above I mention, there is really a need to further upgrade our naval technology.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I also have a few question which need your guidance:<br>1) You mention "Smaller craft can perform the same role at much lower costs."<br>Can you further elborate your meaning by this? Which type of smaller craft can perform the same role?<br><br>2) "huge cruiser bristling with weapons patrolling the Straits of Singapore, then it looks plain stupid".<br>Have you seen which country uses Aircraft Carrier to patrol the straits? Please enlighten me.<br><br>3) "it's not all that difficult to raise a crew, if the ship is necessary."<br>So how many crew you think we can raise? 100, 200, 500 or 1000?.<br><br>4)"costs are astronomical. Maintenance on a squadron of these ships, weapons systems upgrades, R&amp;D, plus technical staff expertise all cost a bomb. We are talking tens of billions at the outset, with plenty more to follow in successive years."<br>If thats the way you think, spending money in defence technology is a waste, than why should we have SAF in the first place? If not willing to spend in technology, don't have SAF is the best choice.<br><br>5) Do you think we can win a naval warfare between us and our neighbour with our present fleet? (without external support).<br><br>I shall conclude there is really a need to upgrade our naval technology, however Singapore is a small country with low population. Manpower is definitely the primary hitch to further expand our naval technology.<br><br>[This message has been edited by millennium (edited 27 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>millennium, you have displayed a serious lack of understanding about naval forces. Let's begin with an aircraft carrier. A CV is not merely what you mentioned. It is mainly a STRATEGIC POWER PROJECTION tool. With a carrier you can strike anywhere in the world. This is a capability we do not need, now or in the foreseeable future.<br><br>You haven't adequately explained the necessity of a CV. Of course for the purposes of this theoretical discussion we leave out  the associated practical problems.<br><br>A platform for air strikes and defence? Of course, but our many airfields can do the same job. Do we need that kind of mobility? Who are we attacking that's beyond the range of our land-based air force?<br><br>A commander's chair? You might like to know that it is only incidental that the carrier is the flagship, because it is the centre of the fleet and the flight ops centre. Any smaller ship can be similarly designated and configured as a command ship.<br><br>For any country to procure a carrier primarily to serve the purposes you described is the height of folly.<br><br>Destroyers and cruisers are gross overkill for the purposes that you suggest, considering the disposition of our neighbours' forces. No, I have not underestimated anyone. Aegis ships, as I have already mentioned, are primarily meant to counter MASSED air and missile attacks against a fleet. Our neighbours are unable to muster a hundred Harpoons or Exocets to launch in a single wave. There is therefore no justification for such ships. Sure, they may beef up their navies sufficiently in the future to be capable of it, but that is baseless speculation. What they do have now, we are able to counter. There is no point in going into erudite technical descriptions about weapons systems here. Please check your facts before making assertions. Look up the information on, for example, the Laksamana and Lekiu-class frigates, some of the best warships in the Malaysian navy. Compare them to what we've got. And look out for capabilities that are not so immediately obvious.<br><br>Nah, we cannot win a war with our navy. I never claimed so. But in a military conflict, our navy can defeat their navy, or navies, if it comes to that. The SAF is guided firmly by the principle of defeating simultaneous attacks by more than one of our neighbours and the navy is no exception to the rule.<br><br>I must stress that we are both outsiders to the military establishment and therefore not privy to specific details. All we can do is make educated guesses, based on available facts.<br><br>There is definitely a need to upgrade our military technology constantly, but at a cost and pace that is acceptable and justifiable. Even our neighbours are realising that. Political and prestige buys are out.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Quisling (edited 27 March 2000).]</div>

The ships would be merely either defending THEMSELVES of escorting cargo vessels in and out of the Singapore Straits in times of emergency. And let's not forget out Air Force.

In any case, your question leads absolutely nowhere. A description of capabilities is useless when not taken in relation to that of their adversaries.

Take the recent one on CVs, for example.<br><br>You continually misread and misinterpret my words, and mistake others' words for mine. How many times has that occurred already?<br><br>And then there's your wholly uncalled-for insults and mocking statements.
