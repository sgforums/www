            <div class='col-md body'>ok guys, listen up, time for some lectures on the defence capability of Singapore and her forward planning strategy.<br><br>When Singapore achieved independence in august 1965, she was a small and vulnerable state with no natural resources and military capability. All matters of defence was under the control of Britain, Singapore's ex-colonial master. Initially, matters of defence can be depended on Britain for help. However, with the speech by Britain in the late 1960s that they are withdrawing troops south of suez, Singapore's government was in a lost...how is this small country defend herself with just 2 infantry regiments and nothing else. Clearly, drastic steps need to be taken.<br>National Service was the option the PAP government decides on. It was clear that as a small and economically weak country (back in the early days of post-independence),Singapore can't afford a army consisting of regular and professional troops.The scheme was meet with hostile reaction from the Chinese population as they believe that "good man do not become soliders". However, due to govt. propaganda and tactics, the bill was passed without protest and the first batch of civilains were inducted into the 1st Singapore Infantry Regiment<br><br>From there on, there was no looking back. With professional and war veterans advisors from Israel, the NS programm got off to a good start. Within a few years later, the Republic of Singapore Navy and Air Force begans to take form and the small republic was on her way to having a military capability capable of holding their own against her closest neighbour of Malaysia and Indonesia.<br><br>From 1965 to 1990, the Singapore Armed Forces have grow from strength to strength and was believed to have numbered 25 000 personnels. From a purely consripted army, the SAF became more professionalised and the reservist troops were maintained at operational readiness throught regular in-camp training and mobolization excerises. In terms of manpower and quality, the SAF proved herself capable of taking on the best in the world as evidenced by the numerous excerise she had with the United States Marines, the Australian Army and fellow ASEAN countries.<br><br>In terms of technical hardware, the SAF proved itself a leap above her neighbours with the acqusition of superior and modern weapons. For the Army, the standard rifle of every infantryman of M-16 is upgraded to the SAR-16, a rather revolutionary weapon that suits the climate and the average Singaporean males. We also see the birth of the Bionix, a locally produced armoured carrier that boosted better firepower and mobility than the her precessor. More and more, we are seeing the birth of the 21st century soldier in which information technology is brought to the battleground.<br><br>We see more hardware upgrading in the Air Force and Navy. As mentioned by the writers in the forum before me, the RSAF and the RSN has brought and upgraded their planes and ships respectively. For more information regarding their recent purchases, please refer to the previous thread.<br><br>In terms of defence doctrines, the SAF has shifted from a "poisonous shrimp" mentality of fighting (in which we will lose but we will make u pay dearly before we capitulate) to a "swift and decisive victory" dogma.The SAF has grown more confident of his ability to tackle outside aggression and believe in taking the war to his enemy. A few good examples of this would be the planting of rubber and palm trees in Pulau Tekong and the various armoured excercies conducted in the plains of Shoal Bay.<br><br>To further defend Singapore's soverignity and territorial integrity, the SAF must continue to be a notch above her neighbours and acquire the latest in technology...for manpower is a premium in Singapore. With the most modern weapon and the most motivated and trained troops in the SAF, Singapore can be assured of a "swift and decisive" victory if war ever comes.<br><br>Mr Hata-san<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim<br><br>[This message has been edited by Mr Hata-san (edited 21 March 2000).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by Mr Hata-san (edited 21 March 2000).]</div>

Being strong does not equate with being aggressive. Being a country that have turmoil bilateral relationship with Singapore, we may take their posturing as recognition of our superior military vis-a-vis theirs.<br>regarding the Israelies advisors, that was way back in the early 1960s. In the 21st century,the SAF does not "hired" advisors. The SAF are on a more equal footing with other developed countries and they are now in the process of sending military advisors to other Third World Countries.<br><br>Mr Hata-san<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>

Both share similair Geo-strategic concerns and both military aims to mesh high technology into their organisation. And yes, Israel is a very good country to turn to, if u are facing arms embargo of any kinds. An excellent example would be apartheid South Africa back in the 70s and 80s.<br><br>Mirage and stealth vessels are the new wave of weapons coming up. To get a better edge over our enemies, one would do well to acquire the best weapons one can find. I will not speculate about the aircraft the RSAF will buy to replace the ageing AS4 Super Skyhawks. One thing for sure, it will be the new generation of fighter cum stealth aircraft the West is developing.The days of tagging aircrafts into interceptor, bombers and recons are over. Multi-capababilty aircraft is the buzz word now. The F-16 is a very good example of the 90's generation of aircraft that can handle different missions requirement.<br><br>Yes, this are all informations that can be found on the nets and publications.

Frigates and "Missile Gunboats" (i used the term loosely cos they definitely packed more firepower than the average MGB) are actually in two different class both in terms of weight and capability.Frigates are definitely an improvement in the arsenal of the RSN and it is no wonder that our "good" neighbours are alarmed about it.<br><br>it is very easy to dimiss an "unworthy" enemy as being over alarmist and discount his blustering and threats. However, it would do well to ackowledge their fears and constantly put ourselves on alert...we wouldn't want to go the way of the Kuwaitis, do we.<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not to nitpick, but manpower is not the primary hitch in acquiring larger vessels like destroyers, cruisers and carriers. The truth is we simply do not need any of those. Even if we could man them adequately (and we are definitely able to man a couple of destroyers or even a cruiser!), they'd be very expensive floating white elephants. Smaller craft can perform the same role at much lower costs.</div>

Most people forgets about the importance of MAINTAINING these frigates and cruisers. They just calculate the money needed to purchase them. However, these vessels are long term assets that need constant repair and maintainance just to keep them operational. All these calculated into costs, expensive costs. A very good example would be the Thai navy. They were very proud of their achievement as being the first ASEAN country to own a "aircraft carrier". With just one economic crisis, the aircraft carrier is reduced to the status of a white elephant. Thai politicians were even thinking of making the aircraft carrier into a tourist attraction, charging people to board and take a look at it!<br><br>Another point which i wish to raise is the issue of blue water navy and whether the RSN is proceeding into this.<br>Points which raise this question is:<br>a) the buying of more and more "bigger" vessels.<br>b) the inclusion of stealth and submarines into the RSN<br>c) Increasing exercises with the Australian, Japanese and Indian Navies, all regional powers with almost blue water navy capability.<br><br>cheers.<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim<br><br>[This message has been edited by Mr Hata-san (edited 24 March 2000).]</div>
