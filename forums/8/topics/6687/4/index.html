            <div class='col-md body'>i think malaysia can go and die!!!<br>they do have the right to control and comment on our military....i think Singapoe made a good choice of buying those frigates...cos the old missle gunboats are obselette...as for other purchases such as the ah-apache...i think its necessary...<br>if you take a careful loook at Singapore's arm forces...it lacks firepower... An enemy like Malaysia could crush Singapore...there fore Singapore needs to constand upgrade its forces....One strong week point in the army now is its tanks...its damm obselete man!!!<br>should change new tanks...recommended--german leopard2....isreli merkava.....or russian t82s...<br>you think about it..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Excuse me....is the topic terrorism in Singapore or from outside Singapore? Do we need all those sophiscated arsenals to combat terrorism within Singapore?<br>Honestly..Singapore Armed Forces are build on the concept of deterrent. We really can't afford to go to war with any country. Our economy will collapse should there be one. And it will be irreversible. That's why our Goverment always try to maintains good bi-lateral relationships with our neighbours. A prosperous neighbourhood is a peaceful ones. The last economic crisis is a good example. Fingers start pointing towards Singapore when our country was unscarthed from the meltdown. The new war strategy is the "information age". The country that holds the "key" to the information of his enemy during the war has the upper-hand. A ship which sails to the frontline, has its GPS position cutoff and radar jams is like a "sitting duck" to its adversaries. Guys..the key is still "information".</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guys,guys,guys,you have forgotten about 1 important aspect of warfare since you are all talking about the capabilities,armaments of the the various ships in Singapore and Malaysia.The important aspect i am talking about is the men on board the ship.If the CO and man are lousy,even giving them a destroyer is not much use while if the CO and men are capable,even if they pilot a corvette or Missile GunBoat(MGB),they are able to destroy ships bigger their size.From what i have heard from friends,our naval officers and CO some are quite garang and capable and have proved to be able to defeat other foreign navies eg Australia in war excercises that we participate in regularly.If counting our present capability taking into consideration crew quality and ships,we are able to hold out against other foreign navies,but the question is only how long can we hold out as foreign navies have a larger number of ships and if they play a war of attrition with us,we will be at the losing end.The question is only when will the tide turn against us as we may win the battle,but not the war as we cannot sustain a long drawn out fight.</div>
