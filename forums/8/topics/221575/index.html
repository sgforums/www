God give us the freedom to think for our future and be responsible for our lives. To those who are rich/prosperous, he will add more. There are many forms of prosperity - Health, financial, social.. etc. So to those who want to go all out to be prosperous, God will give him the authority and the ability to do it. But for those who think they are always lacking and do not wish to go all out to get prosperity, then God will not grant him the ability to get wealth or prosperity or whatsoever. Since the mind has already thought the thought before commitment or action.<br><br>What made people so frustrated is not God. It's they themselves who conceive certain negative thoughts about themselves. They don't conceive but rather rehearse it again and again every single day of their lives. That's what made them so miserable as time passes.<br><br>God gave us brain to think. What goes in, determines what goes out. Simple as that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I great man once said, the man who demands equality, sees himself as lesser than equal of other men.<br><br>Moral of it is, life is not meant to be fair. Life would be so dull if we are all equals in physical attributes, aptitude, etc..<br><br>Like it or not, not all of us start off in life on equal footing, but we cant change the circumstances of our birth. Dont fret about things we have no control over.<br>Be that as it may, neither should we accept the limitations that birth and circumstances impose on us.<br><br>What you should focus on are, the things you have influence over, like diligence, commitment, resolve, strength of character, etc. In my line of work I have the good fortune of working with some very successful people, more often then not the common denominator is always the strength of character, you cannot be truly successful without overcoming adversity.</div>
