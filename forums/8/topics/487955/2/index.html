              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">When Singapore became independent in 1965, it initially sought help from Israeli to help build up Singapore's Armed Force. But in 1968 6 day battles, Israeli sent a shockwave across the muslim arab world, when it successfully won the battle against Egypt. The arab world became very anti-Israeli.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Fearing that if Singapore were to become too Pro-Israeli, Singapore's muslim neighbours such as Malaysia and Indonesia would become very anti-Singapore, and might attack Singapore militarily which would threaten Singapore's security and existence, LKY soon turned to Taiwan for military assistance.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Singapore couldn't possiblity seek PRC's military assistance at that time because <span style="line-height: 1.231;">PRC is communist, and LKY is anti-communist. During the cold war, Singapore's on the side of the free world, being anti-communist. </span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">You may well know that besides the Soviet Communist, <span style="line-height: 1.231;">the Chinese communist supported a global communist revolution world wide aimed at overthrowing all regimes around the world and establishing "communist state". In this sense, the Chinese communist supported the Malaya communist party and Indonesia communist party, with arms and weapons to overthrow the existing regime in order to establish a "communist state". It was during this time, that Lee Kuan Yew felt the threats from the communist subversion warfare.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Also at that time, during the 1965, news of Mao's communist Cultural revolution spreaded to Singapore, many of the local Chinese in Singapore were influenced by left-wing communist ideology, and LKY felt the threats of communist was there.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">That's the reason why LKY, even though relying on the communist for support to gain into power, later started to strike the communist, esp. with the launch of internal security act, i.e. detainment of communist without trial. This in someway is quite similar to Taiwan's "martial law"<em> <strong>R.O.C 's Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion  </strong></em><strong><a class="extiw" style="color: #663366; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 16.015998840332px; line-height: 18.4799995422363px; background: none #f9f9f9;" title="wikt:å‹•å“¡" href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%8B%95%E5%93%A1">å‹•å“¡</a><a class="extiw" style="color: #663366; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 16.015998840332px; line-height: 18.4799995422363px; background: none #f9f9f9;" title="wikt:æˆ¡äº‚" href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%88%A1%E4%BA%82">æˆ¡äº‚</a><a class="extiw" style="color: #663366; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 16.015998840332px; line-height: 18.4799995422363px; background: none #f9f9f9;" title="wikt:æ™‚æœŸ" href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%99%82%E6%9C%9F">æ™‚æœŸ</a><a class="extiw" style="color: #663366; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 16.015998840332px; line-height: 18.4799995422363px; background: none #f9f9f9;" title="wikt:è‡¨æ™‚" href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%87%A8%E6%99%82">è‡¨æ™‚</a><a class="extiw" style="color: #663366; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 16.015998840332px; line-height: 18.4799995422363px; background: none #f9f9f9;" title="wikt:æ¢�æ¬¾" href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%A2%9D%E6%AC%BE">æ¢�æ¬¾</a></strong></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;"><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Neither did US want to help Singapore at that time. The only possible ally at that time was Taiwan.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Taiwan's <strong>Republic of China Armed Force (R.O.C)</strong> had great military combat experience and expertise dating from the times of Chiang Kai Shek in mainland China (such as Northern Expedition, Fight against Communist rebellion, World War II against the Imperial Japanese Army, Cross Straits Warfare against the Chinese communist). It was also an ally of the United States.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;"><span style="line-height: 1.231;">During the cold war, Singapore becomes anti-communist, and there is no better ally than Taiwan, who is also mainly Chinese.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;"><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Taiwan's military strength dated from Chiang Kai Shek's times during the 1950s starting with a secret military plan known as "<strong>Project National Glory åœ‹å…‰è¨ˆåŠƒä½œæ¥­å®¤</strong>" . The military plan aims to retake or liberate mainland China from the Chinese communist by attacking mainland China (ä¸­è�¯æ°‘åœ‹åœ‹è»�æ­¦åŠ›å…‰å¾©å¤§é™¸ä½œæˆ°è¨ˆåŠƒï¼‰. This plan started from 1950s and only ended around the 1970s, and the R.O.C forces were constantly training to fight the communist.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;"><span style="line-height: 1.231;">In 1949, battle of Kinmen as well as 1958 823 Artillery warfare, the R.O.C forces successfully defeated the PLA. Esp. 1958 battle saw the first time in world history air force that air-to-air missiles were used, the Republic of China Air Force (equipped with skilled acefighters and US weapons) successfully shot down several PLA Soviet Aircraft. The R.O.C Air force also constantly raided and spied on the coastal region of mainland China, in military preparation to launch a strike against mainland China to retake it.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">In 1964, the Chinese communist successfully exploded the first nuclear bomb. In response, Chiang Kai Shek launched a secret military plan to accelerate the development of nuclear bomb. This plan was only stopped in 1987 after pressure from US, but recent disclosure of history and classified information revealed that Taiwan also possessed the technology to construct nuclear weapons. It also has successfully exploded a small scale nuclear weapoon.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;"><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><span style="line-height: 1.231;">From 1950s till 1979, the US also had a "</span><strong style="line-height: 1.231;">Sino-Mutual Defence Treaty </strong><strong>ä¸­ç¾Žå…±å�Œé˜²ç¦¦æ¢�ç´„</strong><span style="line-height: 1.231;">" with Taiwan, R.O.C. The US army had garrison forces in Taiwan and also provided military assistance to Taiwan, whether it's equipments or training. The R.O.C in Taiwan calls itself the <strong>"Free China è‡ªç”±ä¸­åœ‹</strong>" during the cold war period, since it still helds the seat to "China" in the United Nations.</span></span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;"><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Singapore sought help from Taiwan because in 1960s-1970s, Taiwan's R.O.C forces are quite strong. Consequently, in 1970, LKY met Chiang Chin Kuo (Chiang Kai Shek's son), he agreed to help Singapore build up a strong forces. In 1975, Singapore's <strong>Starlight æ˜Ÿå…‰éƒ¨éšŠ</strong> was established and were sent to Taiwan for exchange and training, using Taiwan's terrrain and also to train with Taiwan's Armed force.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Taiwan also sent many military personnels to help Singapore, esp. its acefighters were sent to Singapore to help establish Singapore's Air Force System, Intelligence system, Military equipments purchasing. Taiwanese military personnels only withdrew from Singapore's Armed force in 1987 after Chiang Chin Kuo passed away. Today, Taiwan continues to be an ally of Singapore militarily.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">It's historically true that Taiwan helps Singapore build up its defence during its pioneering years of independence. </p>
