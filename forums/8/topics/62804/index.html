I can tell you that I have read with interest every piece that supposedly came from his mouth since the days he was accused of using "mind-games", and to me there is nothing big deal about what he said, just that media blows it up to sell their tabloids.  If you know his personality he is never one to hold back his words, save for public criticisms of his own players.  Is it mind games to say what you feel?  I don't see what's so controversial about most of the things he said, and how they were supposed to act on the minds of the opponents.<br><br>Broke a good manager?  Is that over his comments about how every team plays well against United?  For god's sake we don't need him to say something that myself and many fans have known for years.  Why?  Playing against the biggest team, biggest crowd, largest fan base, pooping their party, avoiding an embarrassing scoreline - that's the kind of motivation to players that not many opponents can provide.<br><br>Or was it another incident you were referring to?  Please enlighten... as I said I can never believe that Fergie's mind games are as good as they were hyped up to be, nor should he be taking any credit for such things...<br><br>As for Thailand incident, I did not follow this at all, and shall therefore reserve my comments.  I will never pass judgment until I know the facts, which is more than can be said of many ABUs...</div>

For sure you'll be pissed.  Did anyone ask Irwin, Henning Berg, Ronnie Johnsen for their comments?  Why does Cantona, such a passionate and fiercely independent player, get on so well with Fergie?  Surely he would not have taken any nonsense?<br><br>For those whose reply is :" ahh, but Cantona himself is a thug" - end of conversation.</div>

Lucky Arsenal sold him to RM at high price and got Henry from Juventus who turned out to be just fine.
