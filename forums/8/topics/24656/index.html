            <div class='col-md body'>and names him in her lawsuit as the fifth defendant.<br><br>Now we all know why....<br><br>The question is...is it fair for him? It's clear he was offering it to her based on the fact that his wife took it and suffered no ill-effects. In short, he geninuely believed it was effective for slimming since it DID work for some.........<br><br>Is it fair to prosecute him because andrea'a vanity couldn't handle reality? ...the need to slim made it her onus to try out the recommended pills.<br><br>Frankly, i dun think saying that she had no time to go for her regular gym workouts is a valid excuse in the eyes of a neutral observer. Let's be straight. If u are seriously health conscious and not slim-conscious, every effort would be made to do some proper workout to tone down those fats instead of taking the "easy" way out and adopting the slimming pills strategy. She took it on her own judgement based on a fren's concerned and sincere advice. Now that it's turned sour, it shd not be a case of dragging him into the mud for "all the pain u've gone thru".<br><br>The manufacturers shd be taken to court, agreed. So shd the distributors as all chipped into the sale of the product knowing the illegal properties of slim-10. They did with intent and hence shd be held accountable.<br><br>Rayson Tan did it truly believing it would work. And why shouldn't he? It worked for his wife, so he never could have realised that he was this close from helping andrea sign her own death warrent. He must be devastated knowing the suffering andrea has already gone thru. Is there any further need to sue him?<br><br>Let us learn from our own vain mistakes but not at the expense of losing a fren.......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm....im not to comment on anything or anyone...but will like to offer some facts if anyone is interested to know<br><br>Andrea had a lump removed from her breast last year. (This was kept under wraps so the media did not announce) After which she started to gain weight. According to her, her schedule was very busy [last year] so she had no time to hit the gym for her workouts, which she used to do before the operation. And because of the hectic life, she had irregular but heavy meals in between her filmings.<br>When she took up the role in Kao Shi Jia Zu, playing Rayson Tan's wife, that's when she often complained that she was getting fat. So, Rayson recommended Slim10, the slimming pills which his wife Chen Li Ping modelled for. Since she [Andrea] had not time for workouts, popping pills seemed to be the easy and convenient way out. She bought the first batch of pills in December 2001 and started consuming them in Jan 2002. After a few doses, she discovered significant weight loss and started to consume the pills on a regular basis until April 2002 when her family began to see physical changes like jaundice and loss of appetite.<br><br>Ok, the rest should be familiar with everyone oredi....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well i still think there should be some accountability for her own actions on her part, regardless of the reasons as to why she decided to take the slimming pills. its common knowledge that slimming pills of any kind usually aren't that healthy, so if she was really health conscious i don't think she should have taken the pills. its even better to stay plump and exercise more when time permits her to do so right?<br><br>and since rayson recommended her the pills with absolutely NO malicious intent, why should he be held responsible at all? whether or not he is acquitted is not important, as based on principles alone he should not even be named a defendent. andrea has really got her morals all messed up. and seriously, being a little overweight isn't a life and death situation. its not like its going to kill her if she doens't slim down......sheesh. she was vain, and she should just admit it and take some responsibility instead of playing the victim. i honestly hope the judge does what's right, and acquits rayson.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How would Rayson know such things would happen. The first batch was alright what, one of my friend ate it and it really showed results. Even if Rayson strongly recommended her to take Slim 10, the final decision was still Andrea's. That means that if Rayson recommends Andrea to jump off from a high rise building, does she really has to jump? Obviously no right? These slimming products are quite "eat at your own risk" kinda product. Maybe the HSA is to be blame. Where is the quality control?<br><br>Anyway, Andrea should just keep quiet and thank God she was able to pick her life back.</div>

Like said, he was just offering the pills as a goodwill gesture since she whined about not being able to workout to slim down. I agree that it's her own choice to pop the pills, no one forced them down her throat, so what's the case here? Even if she really wanted to sue, why not sue Chen LiPing for misrepresentation instead?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Anyway, heard that Chen LiPing took on the ad with the approval of MediaCorp, so does that mean that she should also sue MediaCorp for wilful neglience and lack in conducting due diligence?
