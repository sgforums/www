            <div class='col-md body'>I once had a conversation with a friend who is a christian and we happened to touch on the topic of marriage. I was told that a christian should only marry another christian. Even to marry a Catholic, they will also have to consider twice. And if the other partner is a non-christian, then they will try to convert them to become one of them before going into marriage. Else, the christian will have to make a tough decision - whether to breakup or become an 'impure' christian (the 'impure' christian portion is my own interpretation, sorry if I cause any discomfort to those christian whom lifetime partner is a non-christian). I was quite amazed by his answer.<br><br>I am a buddhist, and If my partner is a follower of another religion (eg. christianity), I will definitely respect her choice. Never will I want her to convert to become a buddhist just because she loves me. By doing so, I also hope she will respect my choice of religion. I may not be with her during their prayer, but I will definitely accompany her to other activities such as family day, organised by her church. And by doing so, I hope she will also accompany me to functions organised by my fellow buddhists.<br><br>So, what's your opinion in this issue?</div>

I was told that a christian should only marry another christian. Even to marry a Catholic, they will also have to consider twice. And if the other partner is a non-christian, then they will try to convert them to become one of them before going into marriage. Else, the christian will have to make a tough decision - whether to breakup or become an 'impure' christian (the 'impure' christian portion is my own interpretation, sorry if I cause any discomfort to those christian whom lifetime partner is a non-christian). I was quite amazed by his answer.<br><br>I am a buddhist, and If my partner is a follower of another religion (eg. christianity), I will definitely respect her choice. Never will I want her to convert to become a buddhist just because she loves me. By doing so, I also hope she will respect my choice of religion. I may not be with her during their prayer, but I will definitely accompany her to other activities such as family day, organised by her church. And by doing so, I hope she will also accompany me to functions organised by my fellow buddhists.<br><br>So, what's your opinion in this issue?</div></blockquote></div>
