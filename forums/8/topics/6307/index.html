            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>I doesn't mean to offend anyone. But i was quite disappointed on how the behaviour of the people in SGcafe. I was there last nite and tried to make so new frens. But the ppl there are so comfortable with their own frens that they neglect new ppl. I think this shouldn't be the way. The purpose of irc is to link many people from diff place to make frens. But this channel doesn't seem to fulfill it's purpose.<br><br>Thank you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
