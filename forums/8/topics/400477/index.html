              <p>Ok..you often see this on ST about a trading or real estate millionaire sharing his success with 2k or more seminars...but why do this if you're already rich?</p>
              <p>And often seminar most particpants realised they either do not have the money nor the network to make it..so is this giving people false hope?</p>

              <p>well, i also attended some of these meeting, firstly, millionaires wanted to become billionaires, and  peoples being greedy by nature, will alway get awe by his richness and way of investing, at the end of the seminara they will ask peoples to buy this stock, that bonds and these shares...and they make your fell like millionaires, so in a hallucinating conditions, you purchased this shares and that stocks, which works into their plan. Once money is in, they take it thru % and become more richer.</p>

              Let me give you an analogy by way of explanation:-
              Why does the English professor wanna teach english since he's already so good at it.....? When a person becomes very good at something, he wants to impart the skilla/know-how to others so that others can benefit too.......

              <p>That is one way of thinking. But behind the economic value and the utility behind it, one may say otherwise.</p>
              <p>But the problem is that most of the people are not him. Unless you follow his way of thinking, his know-how , his abilities and capabilities, its no different in following a self-help book and a religious text. The question now is whether you can really attain such a level too ? What if it inhibits you even more, and changes your personality, morality and principals ?</p>
              <p>In the end of the day, its because people just dont know, or cant really live thier own lives. They need to follow, to learn and adopt from others.</p>
              <p>Examples: Vogue Magazine, Self-help books, Religious Books.</p>
