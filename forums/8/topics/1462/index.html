            <div class='col-md body'>I guess it's always easier for a guy to say break then break. Gals tend to be more emotional and tend to wanna believe that 'one day, he'll change'...we know that it's stupid to think this way...but for those who are involved, it's always hard to make a clean break. The gal tend to 'wanna give him a second chance'...but before she realize it, she has already given him zillion of chances...and she found that she has wasted so much time and youth in the relationship and since she endured for so long, it's really even harder for her to give up.<br>Ok...I know it's unfair to say that all guys are like that or it's all the guys' fault...I guess when a relationship turns for the worse, both party need to be responsible. But as gals, of cos we gals will tend to support our own kind, cos there are too many jerks around. I've even heard of guys who record their sex session on tape and give his friends listen and even boost that the gal he hooked up was a virgin...and there's even a guy who told his friends that he didn't know that his gf of 4 years had such big breast until that day his gf finally allowed him to make love to her. Well...what kind of guy is that to go around telling his friends such things? To think the gal is so trusting. Alot of things are done behind the gf's backs lor. It's really unfair lor...a gal's reputation is very important...how can a bf go around telling other people he and his gf screwed each other and be so proud about it...if words spread round and if the gal found out that all her friends knew the whole process of her lovemaking session, how is she going to face the others?<br>Another thing...why gals stick to her bf even though he's a jerk...alot of times is becos she is 'his woman' liao. Ok, you guys can say if he's so bad then leave him, find someone else. But then...alot of guys may say that virginity nowadays is worthless and not many gals are virgins anymore...but truly, how many guys can really accept a gal who had slept with another guy before? Alot of guys may sound very open, but I can say, alot up till now still prefer virgins. So, once a gal loses her virginity before marriage, her market value would have dropped by ALOT...and to her, she has no choice but to stick to the guy who took away her virginity. And alot of times, the guys threaten their gf that if she love him, she should have sex with him (I'm not saying all guys...but I've heard a number of cases)...and a gal...her own fault and stupidity too...to believe that the guy will be responsible towards her after having sex with them.<br>The fault lies in a gal's too emotional while the guy is too afraid of taking responsibility. In many cases, once a guy hears that his gf is pregnant, either they run or they give their gf money to abort...which is why abortion rate is so high.<br>So gals out there...beware of jerks around. Open eyes big big, grab only if he is a good guy (of cos hard to see with eyes...need to evaluate his character properly). And also...please value your own virginity...there's no need to prove your love to him through giving him sexual pleasures. I feel that sex should be something that is natural and happens naturally...not when one party demands it as prove of love. There's no need to prove anything through sex.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by vs_junjihyun:</div><div class="quote_body">Girl, i know you mean well to all us girls but first of all not all guys are what you describe them to be.<br>Second the girls who actually stay with these 'jerks'(as you put it)need to recheck themselves.<br>Who in the right mind would want to stay with someone who treats them like dirt.<br>I'm not saying it's all the girl's fault and it definitely IS NOT all the guy's fault.<br>Sure, there's gonna be a couple of scums in this world but it's up to the girl to make a decision.

            <div class='col-md body'>Very true. It's like a guy's lust doesn't mean he love...but a gal's lust will normally mean love. For gals, it's hard to lust without love...but for guys, they dun need love to lust. Guy's virginity is not important, yet a gal's virginity is. It's so unfair. No wonder now got a number of 'bian tai' gals around who play with guys' feelings...hehe...alot are those who have been hurt by guys before. So playboys out there...beware...you may be the next victims. You know what is retribution.
