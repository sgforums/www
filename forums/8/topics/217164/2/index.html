            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Phoebie:</div><div class="quote_body">Hm these does not happen in offices or workplace, instead it took place in my relatives' place.<br><br>The experiences that I'm going to relate at this instance took place in the neighbouring Country. My grandpa and uncles live in the second storey of a shophouse. Those shophouse are the type which is used for commercial and small business in the first storey, living quarters in the second storey. The second storey is very wide, bigger than the premium executive flat over here.<br>There's 5 rooms (4 bedroom plus one big storeroom at the back of the kitchen facing the dirty and smelly alley at the back of the shophouse) in total.<br><br>We strongly believe the neighbours house are not clean too as they've related personal spooky experiences. For instance, one lady with ying yang eyes saw things in her house, another uncle saw an old woman in his bedroom ( no wonder his landlord lady always play the Buddhist Chantings on her recorder in the evenings. He got angry and went to off the recorder. But anyway, he is not afraid of such encounters. He has even walk for kilometres alone with only my uncle's dog and a touchlight into the deep jungle in the middle of the night. His purpose is to go to a temple situated in the deep forest. The forest has been reputated for sightings of tigers. And the river beside the temple has sightings of crocodiles. Luckily he came back safety.<br><br>Ok back to relating the experience in my grandpa's shophouse.<br><br>Once, there's a blackout, thus we started to lit candles. Then suddenly from the glimspe of the corner of my right eye in the living room, I saw a white figure heading quickly towards the balcony in the bedroom.<br><br>Another occasion, my cousin saw a pair feets in one of the bedroom while she's sweeping the floor. She got shocked. And my uncle afterwards placed some food beside the floor of the kitchen basin as offerings.<br><br>My mother heard loud sounds in the kitchen (sounds like people pounding chilli in a pounding stone). She thought there's still people living the unit beside ours. My aunt confirmed the unit had been vacant for a long time.<br><br>My dad was sleeping in one of the bedrooms alone when in the middle of the night, he heard loud sounds of furnitures being moved around.<br><br>My brother was sleeping at the second storey in the middle of the night. He heard sounds of things being moved about in the 1st storey.<br><br>My uncle was in the toilet and saw water being played inside. He scolded the spirit vulgarities.<br><br>This one is spooky. I was taking a bath in the kitchen at around midnight. That night is quiet. I'm the type who spent long time showering in the bathroom. Suddenly, very loud sharp knockings (louder than people using hammer to knock nail into the wall) appear on the right wall of the bathroom. The right wall is actually attached to the kitchen!!! Nobody will be knocking nails using hammer in the midnight, and everyone has gone to sleep. I knew the clue and quickly finish my shower and dashed out of the bathroom. Then I went to sleep with my husband. In the middle of the night, I heard sounds of water showering (same sound as water heater showering head splashing water) in the same bathroom in the kitchen.<br><br>Many years ago, my aunties decorated the backyard room aka storeroom, turned it into a romantic relaxation room with soft warm lights. Not long after, they invite a geomencer to come to their shophouse . When he approached the storeroom in the kitchen, the needle on his geomercy plate starts to shake. He told my aunties and uncles there's a spirit living inside the room. They had to fill the room with things and only leave a small passage way to walk within the room. They believed the spirit came from the dark, smelly and dirty alley with drains behind the row of shophouses.<br><br>One particular sole shophouse alone by itself beside the Jungle across the road has been reputated to be haunted. In one of the rooms on the second storey, a sewing machine is seen running by itself.<br><br>But anyway, despite the spooky occurings, I still enjoy visting the place, as it is relaxing and gives me sweet memories of my childhood</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
