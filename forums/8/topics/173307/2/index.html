I wont say for all of us, but for many, its hard to hide our true characters, no matter how often we try to potray ourselves differently, the litmus test is how long our friends can stand us.<br><br>Seen such people around, even during army. Experience shows that in the long term, such people are left alone in the end. I mean, if A can troll or sow discord between people, unless B is an idiot, otherwise B should be scared making friends with A for the long term.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tell teacher? No use. Beat him up? No use, you stupid. There's 2 ways to approach this thing. Either you keep quiet and be patient, control your anger whenever he do that kind of $h!t, or whenever he starts doing the $h!t, you shout at him, curse at him, scream at him, make yourself so mad and crazy but don't lay a hand on him. curse him wisely that you make him look stupid. keep arguing with him until he give up and be paiseh. Play fire with fire. If you can really make him cry just by verbally whacking him, that's it settle already. Remember make him cry by verbal power, but not until you end up the one crying. Don't care if people say you are stooping as low as him. Its a one time thing, fight for your honor, fight for your dignity. Make him cry! Muahaha</div>
