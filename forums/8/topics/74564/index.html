            <div class='col-md body'>This was what i received in my mailbox, very interesting and infomative.<br><br>FRIENDSHIPS AND ROMANCE<br><br>For women, friendships and romantic<br>relationships are two separate things. They are<br>NOT the same.<br><br>One can lead to another, but it's RARE when<br>it happens.<br><br>Remember that.<br><br>One CAN lead to another, but it's RARE.<br><br>"Romantic" relationships are very different<br>from "friend" relationships.<br><br>While most men would sleep with most of their<br>female "friends" if the woman "came on" to<br>them, most women would NOT sleep with most<br>men that they consider "just friends".<br><br>But why is this?<br><br>How do women differentiate between "just<br>friends" and "I'll be intimate with you"?<br><br>And why is it so hard to become "more than<br>friends" with a woman you've been "just friends"<br>with for a long time?<br><br>The answer to this riddle is very interesting<br>to me.<br><br>I believe that the answer comes down to<br>understanding HOW women "know" when they want<br>to "be intimate" with a man... and, even MORE<br>importantly, understanding how women "know"<br>when they DON'T want to "be intimate" with a<br>man...<br><br>The thing that tells a woman whether the guy<br>she's with is "friend" material or "lover"<br>material is how she FEELS.<br><br>It's a combination of EMOTIONAL feelings and<br>PHYSICAL feelings.<br><br>It is NOT logic.<br><br>She might USE logic to "rationalize" her<br>decision... or she might USE logic to SOUND like<br>she has a good reason for either "being with" or<br>"not being with" a particular guy.<br><br>But don't let that distract you.<br><br>Logic isn't important AT ALL in this context.<br><br>So let me say this another way.<br><br>A woman FEELS something emotionally and/or<br>physically, then she uses those FEELINGS as the<br>basis for her "decisions" and actions with a<br>particular guy.<br><br>If she feels that "Ewwww Yuck!" feeling, then<br>her "logical" conclusion will probably not be<br>that she wants to date the guy in question.<br><br>If she feels that "It's Gettin' Hot In Here"<br>feeling, then her "logical" conclusion will<br>probably be that this guy is interesting and<br>attractive, and a good "choice" to date. At<br>this point she'll take ACTION on her feelings<br>and thoughts...<br><br>It goes like this:<br><br>FEEL---&gt;THINK---&gt;ACT<br><br>First the FEELING, then the THOUGHT... and<br>THEN the action.<br><br>Now, with this in mind, let me ask you an<br>important question:<br><br>How do most guys behave around women that<br>they're "romantically" interested in?<br><br>And another:<br><br>What do they do to get the woman that's the<br>object of their desires to be with them?<br><br>Take a few minutes to think about this. Make<br>a list if you have paper and pen handy.<br><br>I'm serious. I'll wait.<br><br>Come back when you're finished.<br><br>Now take a look at your list.<br><br>I'll bet that almost every single thing on<br>your list was something "external".<br><br>In other words, your list probably contains<br>things like "Take her to dinner" and "Give her<br>compliments" and "Buy her flowers" and "Call<br>her often".<br><br>These are all things that demonstrate that<br>he's INTERESTED.<br><br>They are NOT things that trigger those<br>emotional and physical feelings inside of a<br>woman that tell her that THIS IS THE GUY.<br><br>In other words, men try to use "props" to<br>LET A WOMAN KNOW HE'S INTERESTED...<br><br>...HOPING that when the woman sees these<br>displays she'll be interested in him.<br><br>Almost NONE of the things men do to court<br>women make women FEEL ANYTHING even remotely<br>similar to "Attraction" and "Arousal".<br><br>Of course, you know this.<br><br>You've probably done this stuff about a<br>bazillion times. I have, too. I know what it's<br>like to try OVER AND OVER to let a particular<br>woman know that I'm interested... only to have<br>her NOT RESPOND in a "romantic" way.<br><br>The PROBLEM with this kind of thing is that<br>it makes TWO HUGE MISTAKES at once.<br><br>First, it's just the plain-old wrong way to<br>go. Telling or showing a woman that you "like<br>her" has no effect on how she feels about YOU.<br><br>In the moment it sure seems to make sense...<br>"If I show her how I feel, she'll return the<br>feelings".<br><br>Duh.<br><br>Like I said, it seems like the right thing<br>to do in the moment (when your inner little<br>girl has a big fat crush). But it's not... it<br>will have NO effect on her feelings for you.<br><br>And second, it communicates clearly that<br>YOU DON'T GET IT. It tips a woman off INSTANTLY<br>that you're not hip to what's going... and it<br>kills your chances with her.<br><br>Say what?<br><br>You mean that doing nice things for women,<br>and trying to show how you feel can actually<br>HURT your chances with a woman?<br><br>Yea, it can.<br><br>Look, if you've been dating a woman<br>exclusively for six months, and her birthday<br>comes... it's OK to buy her a gift and tell<br>her that you like spending time with her.<br><br>YOU'RE ALREADY IN A RELATIONSHIP.<br><br>But if you've known a woman for six DAYS<br>and you try this kind of thing, you're going<br>to shoot yourself in the foot.<br><br>Women are EXPERTS at recognizing men who<br>DON'T GET IT. And if you DON'T get it, PLUS<br>you're trying to compensate for the fact that<br>you don't get it with gifts and compliments,<br>then you're REALLY screwed (or not screwed,<br>as the case may be).<br><br>Remember what I'm about to tell you.<br><br>Burn it into your mind.<br><br>Write it on a sticky-note and put it on<br>your computer monitor...<br><br>SINGLE, ATTRACTIVE WOMEN WATCH MEN<br>TRY TO WIN THEM OVER ALL DAY LONG. THEY<br>KNOW WHEN A GUY DOESN'T "GET IT"... AND<br>THEY'RE ANNOYED WHEN A GUY WHO DOESN'T<br>"GET IT" JUST KEEPS TRYING AND TRYING<br>AND TRYING.<br><br>Keep in mind that single, attractive women<br>watch guys do this stuff 24/7. They shake<br>their pretty heads and say "He doesn't get<br>it... He doesn't get it... He doesn't get it"<br>over and over and over.<br><br>The point is that if you DON'T GET IT,<br>then nothing you do is going to work for you.<br><br>The problem is bigger than you can imagine,<br>and you're going to need to take a totally<br>different road to get where you're going...<br><br>WHAT ATTRACTIVE WOMEN HATE MOST<br>ABOUT SINGLE GUYS...<br><br>Let's return to where we started.<br><br>There are a few particular things that<br>REALLY annoy single, attractive women.<br><br>One of the reasons that these things<br>annoy women is because they're DEAL KILLERS.<br><br>A woman can like everything about you, but<br>if you do these things (or even ONE of these<br>things), it can DESTROY your chances of<br>success with a particular woman.<br><br>Here are a few of the BIG things that<br>single women hate:<br><br>1) Giving Up Your Status In Exchange For<br>Her Attention And Approval<br><br>If I had to describe the one single thing<br>that both annoys women and DESTROYS a guy's<br>chances, it would be this.<br><br>It has taken me a long time to see this<br>particular pattern, but it's EVERYWHERE.<br><br>Men, in effect, say "Hi, I want your<br>approval and attention. I'm willing to let<br>YOU be the one who's in control... and let<br>YOU call the shots... and do anything to please<br>YOU... if you'll give me your attention and<br>approval".<br><br>But the problem is that women DON'T WANT<br>you to give up your status and "manliness".<br><br>Women aren't ATTRACTED to men who act<br>weak and tentative.<br><br>Women secretly HATE IT when a guy does<br>something to demonstrate that he'll give<br>away his power in return for approval.<br><br>THEY HATE IT!<br><br>I could literally write an entire book on<br>this one single concept.<br><br>Take a few minutes to think this one over,<br>and maybe write down the ways that you make<br>this mistake with women.<br><br>More importantly, think about how you're<br>going to STOP DOING IT IMMEDIATELY.<br><br>2) Being Needy, Clingy, And Insecure<br><br>When one person "clings" to another person<br>"psychologically", the person who is being<br>"clinged to" RESENTS and REJECTS the needy,<br>clingy emotional parasite...<br><br>This is WUSS behavior at its worst.<br><br>If a guy is on the phone with a girl he<br>just met, and she says "Hey, I have to go",<br>he might say "Aw, well... um... OK. Um, will<br>you call me when you get home?".<br><br>Or let's say a guy and a girl are out on<br>their first date, and they're walking around<br>in a large department store.<br><br>Most guys will follow the woman everywhere,<br>and not leave her side for a minute.<br><br>If she wanders away, he'll come find her<br>IMMEDIATELY.<br><br>He'll stay physically close to her, as if<br>he's afraid she'll leave without him.<br><br>And an even worse example is a guy who is<br>so emotionally insecure that he actually<br>ASKS a woman to tell him that he's nice, fun,<br>interesting, etc.<br><br>"Do you think I'm interesting?"<br><br>"Do you think we could ever have a<br>relationship?"<br><br>"Am I your type?"<br><br>Women HATE this stuff. It makes them<br>shiver with the heebie-jeebies. It makes them<br>want to RUN AWAY.<br><br>3) Not Leading - And Even Worse, Trying To<br>Get Her To Lead<br><br>Women have WUSS-DAR.<br><br>One of the things that triggers a woman's<br>WUSS-DAR is a man who FOLLOWS.<br><br>The REAL problem is that most women won't<br>try to LEAD naturally.<br><br>So you've got a situation where a man is<br>trying to FOLLOW a woman who isn't LEADING.<br><br>He's looking for little cues so he knows<br>where to go and what to do... but he isn't<br>getting them.<br><br>So what does he do?<br><br>He ASKS for them!<br><br>He says "So, I was thinking of maybe<br>taking you to Olive Garden for dinner... how<br>does that sound?".<br><br>Everything about the way he asks says to<br>the woman "I'm trying to figure out what you<br>want me to do... please help me know how you<br>want me to act, where you want me to take<br>you, and what you want me to say".<br><br>This is ATTRACTION DEATH!<br><br>men who don't lead, and even worse, try<br>to get a woman to lead, ANNOY THE HELL OUT<br>OF SINGLE WOMEN.<br><br>They HATE IT!<br><br>4) Using Insecure, Approval-Seeking,<br>Low-Status Posture, Gestures, Voice Tone,<br>And Body Language<br><br>There's a term that single, attractive,<br>in-demand women use to describe men who use<br>weak, approval-seeking posture, gestures,<br>comments, and mannerisms...<br><br>The term is "NICE".<br><br>"He's nice... but... there's no chemistry."<br><br>This is  one of those areas that's not<br>easy to talk about.<br><br>Since SO DAMN MANY GUYS do this stuff,<br>it's almost impossible to explain.<br><br>It's like trying to tell a fish that<br>they're not going to get anywhere in life<br>if they stay wet.<br><br>The fish doesn't even KNOW it's wet in<br>the first place.<br><br>But let me try.<br><br>This is important.<br><br>Go spend a day observing couples.<br><br>Go places where couples that have just<br>met spend time together.<br><br>Bars, clubs, coffee shops, whatever.<br><br>Now watch the GUYS.<br><br>Watch how they lean towards the women.<br><br>Watch how they raise their eyebrows in<br>exaggerated response to women's comments.<br><br>Watch how they slump over, let their<br>shoulders fall forward, and smile fake-ly<br>at whatever the women say.<br><br>If you're close enough, listen to how men<br>ask questions and make comments with a voice<br>tone that says "I'm insecure and I'm trying<br>to be extra nice to compensate for it".<br><br>You'll see it EVERYWHERE.<br><br>In fact, you'll see it so much that<br>you'll probably write me back to tell me<br>that I'm the one who's crazy, and that since<br>it happens so much, it must be "the right<br>way".<br><br>Well, it's not.<br><br>If there's one thing that triggers an<br>attractive single woman's WUSS-DAR, it's<br>a man's posture, gestures, eye contact,<br>voice tone, etc.<br><br>It all happens in an INSTANT.<br><br>Women read this stuff and interpret it<br>as instantly and accurately as you read<br>and interpret the cover of Playboy.<br><br>NO ANALYSIS NECESSARY.<br><br>I'd say that probably 90% of all men<br>alive today INSTANTLY disqualify themselves<br>with women because of this problem.<br><br>Their voice tone, gestures, posture, etc.<br>TELEGRAPH the message that they're a WUSS.<br><br>They do a thousand weird little things to<br>let a woman know that they're uncomfortable<br>and "not being themselves".<br><br>And you guessed it...<br><br>Single women HATE IT!<br><br>5) Not Understanding That She's A Woman And<br>You're A Man<br><br>I'm about to get philosophical on your ass,<br>so be cool.<br><br>When it comes down to it, most men don't<br>understand women.<br><br>But the REAL kicker is that most men don't<br>understand MEN, either!<br><br>Most guys don't know what it's like to get<br>in touch with their MALE NATURE.<br><br>Combine these two issues, and you get a<br>guy who behaves in ways that DO NOT trigger<br>ATTRACTION in women.<br><br>Women have a "nature". A female nature.<br><br>Men also have a "nature". You guessed it,<br>it's a MALE nature.<br><br>Women are coy. They like to play hard to<br>get. They like to enjoy the chase. They love<br>anticipation. They love to "let a guy catch<br>them"...<br><br>Men are competitive. Men are dominant. Men<br>like to play rough games, win things, and<br>rule their territory.<br><br>Well guess what?<br><br>Most men don't BEHAVE like men when they're<br>in the presence of a woman that they "like".<br><br>And since most men don't understand female<br>human nature, they don't demonstrate that<br>they "get it" when they're with women that<br>they "like".<br><br>Women like men. Men like women. There are<br>POWERFUL causes at play here.<br><br>When you're around a woman you like, don't<br>act like a GIRLY-MAN. It's not sexy, and it's<br>not attractive...<br><br>And single women HATE IT!<br><br>6) Not Being Interesting To Be Around<br><br>Underneath most behavior that I see most<br>guys acting out is a "core belief" that goes<br>like this:<br><br>"I don't believe that an attractive woman<br>would want to be around me just because she<br>enjoys my presence... so I make up for it by<br>saying and doing certain things that I hope<br>she'll enjoy... and if she enjoys those<br>other things enough, then maybe she'll want<br>to spend more time with me."<br><br>Heavy, man.<br><br>Well guess what? Most attractive single<br>women KNOW that if a guy isn't interesting<br>to be around, they she's eventually going to<br>go CRAZY being around him.<br><br>In other words, no amount of material<br>gifts, compliments, dinners, and other<br>"displays" will EVER compensate for a lack<br>of BEING INTERESTING.<br><br>Here's a profound thought:<br><br>I and several other guys I know have<br>many women who call us often... just because<br>they enjoy being around us.<br><br>These women would be happy just to be in<br>the same room with us... and enjoy our<br>company.<br><br>And yes, these women CALL US.<br><br>Often.<br><br>Material gifts, food, flowers, and other<br>"displays" have ZERO lasting value to a<br>woman when it comes to how she FEELS about<br>you...<br><br>An attractive single woman wants a guy<br>who LIGHTS HER UP. She wants to FEEL GOOD.<br><br>She wants mystery... she wants to laugh...<br>she wants a challenge... she wants sexual<br>tension...<br><br>If you're using compliments, gifts, food,<br>and other "displays" to get a woman's<br>attention... you need to ask yourself a<br>tough question:<br><br>Is it because you don't believe that a<br>woman would want to be around you just to<br>be around you?<br><br>Because if you don't know how to be<br>INTERESTING to a woman, then no amount of<br>compensation is going to fix the problem.<br><br>If you're boring, predictable, and<br>uninteresting, then you're never going to<br>have women calling YOU to hang out.<br><br>Oh, and women HATE IT.<br><br>7) Not Understanding Attraction<br><br>This is a BIGGIE.<br><br>You hear me talking about it all the time,<br>right?<br><br>Maybe now that you've read this newsletter<br>you'll have a better context to understand<br>what I'm about to tell you...<br><br>If you "get it" with women, it's SUPER<br>INTERESTING and ATTRACTIVE to them.<br><br>Women can INSTANTLY FEEL IT when they're<br>with a guy who "gets it".<br><br>Women know very quickly if they're<br>talking to a guy who understands himself<br>and women... and who enjoys creating and<br>building sexual tension.<br><br>Women know if a guy speaks the SECRET<br>LANGUAGE of "Sexual Communication".<br><br>If he doesn't, then she stops all<br>communication on that level.<br><br>If he does, then it continues.<br><br>ATTRACTION Isn't A Choice.<br><br>Attraction is an emotional and physical<br>RESPONSE... and you can't "convince" a woman<br>to feel it with logic, gifts, and NICENESS.<br><br>Attraction is the result of a woman meeting<br>a man who understands how attraction works...<br>and who knows what to do in each specific<br>situation to progress to the next level.<br><br>The PROBLEM with ATTRACTION, and with<br>success with women in general is that the<br>things you need to DO to be successful are NOT<br>OBVIOUS.<br><br>They're "counter intuitive", in many cases.<br><br>In other words, they're the OPPOSITE of<br>what you'd THINK would make sense.<br><br>You have to do things like CREATE<br>TENSION... stop doing something that she<br>likes... give her time to miss you... etc.<br><br>And if you don't understand ATTRACTION,<br>a woman is going to KNOW IT.<br><br>And guess what?<br><br>Single women HATE IT when a man doesn't<br>understand ATTRACTION and how to communicate<br>on this "other level".<br></div>
