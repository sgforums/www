            <div class='col-md body'>According to most interpretations of Hindu scriptures, including the Vedas, the Kali Yuga (lit. Age of Kali , also known as Iron Age) began at the end of Krishna's bodily lifespan (approximately 5100 years ago, 3102 BCE) and will last exactly 432,000 years  placing its conclusion in the year 428,899 CE (it began with a year 0). Kalki, the 10th and final avatar of Vishnu, is expected to appear at this time, riding a white horse and wielding a flaming sword with which to strike down the wicked.<br><br>Kali Yuga is the last of four Yugas upon its conclusion, the world will 'reboot' into a new Satya Yuga (Golden Age). This involves the end of the world as we know it and the return of Earth to a state of paradise. Kali Yuga began at midnight (00:00) on 18 February 3102 BCE according to the Surya Siddhanta, which is an astronomical treatise that forms the basis of all Hindu and Buddhist calendars.<br><br>Kali Yuga is sometimes referred to as the Iron Age because it was also the time when forging iron was discovered. Throughout the Kali Yuga, human civilisation degenerates further.<br><br>Problems that arise<br><br>There is an increase in material technology but there is a huge decrease in spirituality. Kali Yuga is the only Yuga in which irreligion/atheism is more powerful and popular than religion. Only a quarter of each of the four virtues of Dharma (penance, truthfulness, compassion and charity) is carried out by humans now. Nobility is determined only by the wealth of a person. Law and justice are determined by one's prestige and power. The poor become enslaved by the rich and powerful. Words such as charity and freedom are constantly used by the people, yet are never done.<br>[edit]<br><br>Warfare<br><br>"Civilised" warfare is gone and humans fight like Asuras and Rakshasas. Unlike in the other Yugas where there would be a daily ceasefire by sunset to mourn the losses, cremate the victims, and to reflect on the war, Kali Yuga battles are fought constantly, just for the sake of winning. Sadism also flourishes.<br>[edit]<br><br>Nobility/respect<br><br>In Kali Yuga, people are no longer respected for intelligence, knowledge or spiritual wisdom. Instead, material wealth and, to a lesser extent, physical strength, are what make a person highly regarded. Even though respect is shown superficially among the people, no one sincerely respects anyone. Everyone believes that the ultimate goal in life is to be respected, hence becoming wealthy and physically strong.<br>[edit]<br><br>Changes in the people<br><br>Throughout the age, humans become shorter in height and weaker physically as well as mentally and spiritually. There is false preaching of false Gods, idols and gurus. Many people lie and claim themselves to be prophets and God-like beings. In addition, everybody will modify the definitions of fasting, meditation and austerity, so that they suit their needs. However, by doing this, they are not following the strict moral code and law of the Vedas, therefore they will hardly gain anything.<br>[edit]<br><br>Changes in men<br><br>In Kali Yuga, men question the power of Brahmins, religious ceremonies, the existence of Gods, and the authority of the Vedas. There is no longer any respect towards elders or children. Jealousy grows in each man and they despise, hate, and are ready to kill one another over a few coins. The actions of men and savage beasts are alike.<br>[edit]<br><br>Changes in women<br><br>Women in this era shall be immoral and licentious by nature because they are neglected and left unprotected. Although earlier they are treated as inferior to the male and always abused, later on they begin to dominate politics and other affairs. Women begin to eat too much. They lose their shyness and begin to betray their husbands by having affairs. Many women engage in prostitution. Because of this, a high and unwanted number of children are born, so abortion is introduced.</div>
