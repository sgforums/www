              <p>Dear all,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have a few M1 lines signed under my name for my family members and I have been with M1 for more than a decade already.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One of the lines is for my elderly mother who is currently room-restricted with Tuberculosis virus.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In October and November 2009, I rushed in and out of hospital mas my mother was hospitalised with Tuberculosis and she was reduced to bones.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>During her 2nd admission, she dropped the phone into the hospital toilet bowl.  I sent it to Nokia Service Centre but the warranty was void due to liquid damage.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I then replaced her with another phone.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Upon discharge, she was brought to my brother's house for recuperation and is still currently room-restricted.  As a result of her condition, all our family members have to be on anti-Tuberculosis germ medication for 6 - 9 months.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In April 2010, I received the bill from M1 and was shocked that there was incurment of S$299 of data usage charges and asked for termination of the GPRS service to that line number.  I then wrote to M1 to request for waival but was rejected reason being I had requested for waival previously on another line number.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I explained to M1 that my mother is illiterate and suffering from poor vision and is still room-restricted by the illness.  The data usage could be a case of accidental access or unknown access.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I brought this matter to my brother and he checked with his children if they had used my mother's phone while my mother was sleeping.  He even disciplined them but they denied using the phone.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then comes my May 2010 bill and it showed another new data usage charge of S$80+ in the new bill.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I wrote in to M1 to request for investigation and explained to them my difficult circumstances but was declined waival.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>M1 insisted that they were internet accesses and they could not provide itemised listing of the usage.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I feedback to M1 that:-</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) Both my brother's and my flats have WiFi internet accesses and that it is unlikely that anyone would want to access the internet in any way via GPRS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) The incurment was one time and not on regularly monthly basis and why M1 could not reconsider the waival.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) GPRS is no longer popular if you were to compare with 3G HSPDA access.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) GPRS internet access is very expensive.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5) On medical ground, why M1 is not able to re-consider a waival?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Still M1 insisted that they based their decision based on previous past record that I had requested for waival of similar nature for another line.  In fact that happened to the other line which was used by my spouse.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What I am trying to explain to them is that they should relook into this GPRS charging system.  One can run into high GPRS billing debt if some buttons on some Nokia phones fail and GPRS feature is activated unknowingly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It had happened to many people I spoke to.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Should I terminate my loyalty to M1 after the contract ends?  Should I port all my M1 lines to SingTel?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is it true service providers only interested to make money and get new subscribers to sign up?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Would like to know your valuable and expert views.  Thanks.</p>
