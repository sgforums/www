              <p> The Brits were the first to desert us when Singapore wasn't worth their time during the war. They weren't here to make our life better. They were here to make theirs. And the same goes for the expats who come here nowadays, but there's nothing wrong with that.</p>
              <p>Singapore is only what, less than 200 years old since the Brits landed here, so in terms of culture, how are we to compare to the Americans or the Brits? In other Asian countries, most of the English spoken is just as atrocious, like China and Japan. Difference between them and us is, they've been around long enough with enough recognition in contributions to modern technology to boot.</p>
              <p>There are already 2 very established expat forums out there catered to bashing Singaporeans. Their moderators will make no qualms about putting us down and saying how they can't wait to go home, (but they're still here anyway). And you'll have many fellow expats who'll jump to your defence when you do. So go ahead and knock yourself out there.</p>
              <p>The truth is, you're the expat here, not us. You are the guest in our home country. We do not go into your home and start critisizing how crappy your home is. And as a guest, no matter what you think, you will always be intruding, no matter how much you think you're contributing.</p>

              <p><br>                   Now as I am always saying that one has to be careful of many of the white people in Asia as many are on the run from the police in their home country and/or people who want to beat them or kill them in their home country. They take their backstabbing brownnosing ways to Asia and proceed to be an embarassment to all white people as they are in their home country.</p>

              <p><br>    I just love the way you guys treat guys with tattoos here. I remember Clinton crticising caning offenders. I wouldn't have made a stink if I were going to get caned. I would just want it done and over with. Later California was discussing adopting this effective method of punishment. Singapore certainly does many things right <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p>i am a foreigner, OK , Let me tell you why Ang Mo salary is higher than singaporeans.</p>
              <p><strong>Cos singaporeans do not have their own  core technology.</strong></p>
              <p>Think about it. What is created by singaporean? IT? Nuclear? New power resourses? military?life science? even if food? the above things singaporeans all need to purchase from Ang mo.  </p>
              <p>the matter of fact, there is no difference between Singaporean and "Chinaman", we can only work for those foreign technology,becouse we can not creat new things that ang mo needs. The only difference maybe Singaporean salary higher than Chinman.</p>

              <p><br>I'm a local, and I agree with this statement, that's why we have lots of third world countries people working here, we have got nothing to sell to the world. That's one reason, IMO why PAPist are importing so much people, yes, our birthrate are non-existance but to import so much people at the expense of locals only confirm that a citizen genocide that is in progress now is essential for PAPist regime to survive, they have been doing far too many wrong deeds to just relinquish their posts and retire.</p>
              <p>The roots of the problem with us not having enough core technology simply is the way PAPist handled education and brilliant people. Local education in the past decades is hopeless in cultivating creative people, and exacerbated even more with such few universities, PAPist are always wary of clever people who did not ascribe to PAPist propaganda, so those people upped and left or they ventured into other business that have very little to done with hard science, you can see it with so many of engineering graduates in banks or financial institutes.</p>
              <p>Time is already squandered, as the 90s rolled away, the vulnerability of Sinkapore seemed even more real, as China and India start to awoke and made giant strides in their economies.</p>
              <p>I do suppose education in Sinkapore is now better but when you attend a session of National Education which is a subject in secondary schools, it extolls on the virtue of PAPist which is appalling and it reaks of brainwashing which again really begs the question." What kind of students do the government want to cutivate? Robots?"</p>
              <p>Lots of foreigners are now working in hard science jobs but most of them are still doing more or less maintainance work which hardly innovates. Another move by the government to save its' own bloated state companies.</p>
              <p>PAPist have far too many government-linked companies with bloated board of directors that are either PAPist ministers or MPs, this create a conflict of interest which will impair proper innovation and with their giantic sizes, their selfish ways to protect their own interest will snuff out most small start ups. Most of them are just merely administrators who do not innovate, what's worst, we have one of the world's worst mangers here in Sinkapore who will be at loss to handle any new thing or even to cultivate talents.  We don't really have much global companies that can compete shoulder to shoulder with other foreign companies.</p>
              <p>We are still at the mercy of foreigner companies, if they don't come, even more locals will be unemployed, but this is unhealthy and sooner or later, even more locals will simply up and leave also, more than those that are leaving now. This is unsustainable, wages that cannot even pay for proper food, shelter and things for kids will render this place unliveable. I went to NTUCee, a government-linked supermarket, prices have definitely risen far too much for the average working man. This is not good, and the government is still try to paint a positive picture through stated-owned Shxt Times.</p>
              <p>I, to try to summarize, this country will not look after its own citizens that is why should anyone spend time to research and innovate and get cut down by state-owned government companies? Would not time be better well spent trying to start business related to services or anything non hard science, a painfree way to self survival, a few million dollars in pocket, with a free-hold condominium, with a car to avoid packed MRT trains, a self-started company that can hitch onto the massive service markets generated by the influx of foreigners?</p>
              <p>There will be pain down the long road, if we can really dismantle all bloodsucking government companies and really watch how they try to survive without government help. That will also causes job losses, but a REFORM is neccessary to ensure fairness to the people of Sinkapore, to ensure that people here will not be cast away like used dolls and that to create a proper environment where patriotism go hand in hand with the freedom to create and the strong belief that success is not a government ball carrying business but a moral obligation to return to society what is given and have financial freedom as a result of that and to reinvest that to our community.</p>
              <p>To create a real place where people can live, fight and die in the belief that their lives were not in vain for the sacrifice that they did for this country.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Please do read this plan by REFORM PARTY to restructure growth:</p>
