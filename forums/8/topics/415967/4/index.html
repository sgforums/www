              <p>Your company is not what we are peeved about, what we are peeved
              about is how some foreigners delibrately hire their own countrymen
              even when they can't really perform well at the job and has severe
              English communication problems. Wages are so low now that more jobs
              can't be taken up by locals even if they suck it up. People are
              having a hard time paying for that stupid HDB flats that will cost
              them around S$300k, and also plus interest paid to bank around
              S$100k more. They need a more manageable amount to survive.</p>
              <p>Third world country people are grabbing everything from normal
              workers all the way to managers with a willingness to take very low
              pay for those jobs. The local youngs without much working
              experience gets sidelined by those foreigners and the anger has now
              exploded into gang fights with aimless youth. The future is bleak
              for all citizens if this trend continue. The original purpose of
              attracting companies to set up base here to provided jobs for
              locals have been lost.</p>
              <p>To add to the woe of citizens, new flats are finished in 2 to 3
              years time and even if young couples queue for those flats, the
              amount of flats are so little that young people are being forced to
              buy old resale flats.The occupiers of current resale flats are
              sometimes also third world foreigners who have plans to return home
              after a few years of work here. Some of these flats can sell for
              more than S$500k, so when those people go home to their third world
              country, they become instant millionaires.</p>
              <p>So all those people will become millionaires, when our people,
              even the young has to pay for it. I don't remember Sinkapore being
              a international charity organisation. We lose our jobs, our homes
              and even our meaning of being a citizen, and the young have to
              serve 2 years of National Services defending the PAPist regime. Why
              do we have to be pawns at the hands of a government that suppress
              free speech, the right to hold lawful assembly and delibrately
              control the press and every conceivable instruments to ensure that
              they stay in power and breed their own cronies to control state
              linked companies who also prefer cheap third world workers,
              enriching their own pockets while destroying the lives of citizens
              who prop up their bastard regime and their enlightened despot
              LKY.</p>
              <p>The government own Sinkapore, period. 90% of the land in
              Sinkapore are owned by the government through the Land acquisition
              Act which paid peanuts to the the owners for it. Because of that
              they should provide proper housings for locals that ensure that
              locals do not have to worry about that problem and focus on work.
              Instead the government went and enriched its own coffers, pegging
              public housing to private properties prices.</p>
              <p>All utilities and major companies are still owned by the
              government despite claims of having being privatised. There's a
              saying, " If you open a company in Sinkapore, you will have to
              compete with the government." Most are owned indirectly by Temasick
              Holdings chaired by the daughter-in-law of the enlightened despot
              LKY who routinely lost hundreds of millions of dollars through
              lousy investments, together with another by proxy money bag of the
              government,  GICee which is chaired by the famous despot. Btw,
              GICee is also regularly in a festive mood to lose lots of taxpayers
              money through lousy investments. What's worst those two jokers (LKY
              and his daughter in law) are still there, not fired, what kind of
              accountability do we have? Even the Congress is looking for people
              to punish for the US financial meltdown.  The government is
              driven entirely by profits and their own PAPist party survival and
              will not help citizens. They will stand and watch us die, slowly
              and surely without even the slightest shred of remorse at the
              hideousness of their own crimes.</p>
              <p>If the oppositions ever gain power and investigate the doings of
              the PAPist, some of the people in PAPist will be in trouble, I can
              bet my bottom dollar on that. That's why the PAPist will rather
              destroy this country than face punishment and humiliation at the
              hands of those that they once suppressed.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">“The original purpose of attracting companies to set up base
              here to provide jobs for locals have been lost.” I agree with that.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">If I were to set up a company overseas (“I” would usually come
              from a more developed country with better capital and expertise to a less
              developed country), surely I would look to hire the locals to do most of the
              job possible since it would be cheaper. Besides moving closer to the new
              country/market, it is also to save cost in terms of rental and labour. Why
              would I want to hire my own countrymen to serve as expats there when I also
              have to pay for their housing/transport/family?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">If you’ve ever tried to set up a business in Singapore which
              requires labour or heavy man hours, I can most certainly bet you would have
              considered hiring foreigners for the job. Why? Because they are cheaper. And
              why not? Because the govt has made it so convenient to hire them. Just like
              what calmday said about his govt, our govt is doing nothing to control that. And
              their influx has thus made our wages (and the employers’ expectations) much
              cheaper. With it will (and already has) bring/brought about increase in rental
              and housing prices. Do not blame the locals for being greedy. If you had the
              chance to sell your flat higher, would you rather not? How else would you
              expect to make money when your wages aren’t going to go up due to foreign competition?
              Not to mention rising utility bills and what not.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">What they need to do, is to accept those with real
              contributions, like companies that provide jobs for locals, those with talent
              or expertise to teach the locals, or to do jobs that locals truly shun (if you
              pay us decently, we’ll still sweep the floors for you, I guarantee you that).</p>

              <p><br> ya, they are not so much family orientated like asian, we respect
              our ancestors, some of them dun even know who their
              grandpa. they are like bird, once grew up, fly away and on their
              own. But one thing i like them is that they are very
              independent, flexible and adaptable. Unlike asian who like to nags
              nags and nags, need lots of support and very inflexible to changes
