              <p>I have heard alots of people and even the govt saying, ya, foreigners sent back, now who is going to do the mannual works and stuffs, i believe that if foreigners were all send back, somehow, someway, people will do the job themselves, we will have better qualify construction workers, better knowledge shipyard workers and better cleaners and so on. It is therefore a very lame excuse to alway take the worrying that without foreigners, we all die, that should not be the case, if you dun do it, how do you know, Singapore is built without foreigners. We are the people who can face up to tough and dirty times, we dun mind even to go back to 3rd world if we are happy within ourselves as a family. Tell me, do you like strangers in your house even tho this strangers help you with your housework and income??</p>

              <p><strong>OPINION</strong></p>
              <p>There
                   are three myths propagated by PAP leaders and perpetuated by the 
                  Singapore media about foreign workers which need to be corrected here:</p>
              <p><strong>1. Foreign workers are employed only in sectors shunned by Singaporeans.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>2. Singaporeans are “fussy” and employers have a hard time recruiting them.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>3. The government cannot shield Singaporeans from global competition.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>By
                   now, we should already know that foreigners are employed across all 
                  industries in Singapore and they are allowed to compete directly 
                  with Singapore citizens for jobs which can otherwise be taken up by 
                  them.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The influx and easy availability of foreign workers depress 
                  the wages of Singaporeans who need a minimal wage to enjoy a decent 
                  standard of living in Singapore.</strong></p>
              <p>For example, the inflow of large 
                  number of foreign engineers and technicians from China and India has 
                  kept the starting pay of Singapore engineers stagnant for the last few 
                  years while the cost of living has ballooned.</p>
              <p>PAP leaders have 
                  always insisted that the search for talent is a “global phenomenon” and 
                  Singaporeans have no choice but to compete directly with them.</p>
              <p>PAP
                   strongman Lee Kuan Yew told National Geographic magazine in a recent 
                  interview that it is a “good” thing that Singapore has welcomed so many 
                  Chinese immigrants (from China) as they are more “hard-driving” and 
                  “hard-striving” than Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>It is the duty of the elected 
                  government of the day to take care of its citizens first and NOT 
                  foreigners. In other countries like Australia, New Zealand and Canada, 
                  measures are put in place to safeguard the interests of locals. Not only
                   did the PAP government not do so, it is introducing lop-sided labor 
                  policies to make life difficult for Singaporeans instead.</p>
              <p>If a 
                  Singaporean wants to apply to work overseas in any country, he or she 
                  must obtain a work visa or permit to even set foot there in the first 
                  place.</p>
              <p><strong>Singapore has a unique scheme not heard anywhere else in 
                  the world where foreigners are given a year to stay in Singapore to look
                   for jobs here:</strong></p>
              <p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/epec585.jpg" alt="" width="585" height="350"></p>

              <p><strong>[Source: Manpower Ministry]</strong></p>
              <p>The
                   Employment Pass Eligibility Certificate (EPEC) allows foreigners who 
                  are i) holders of selected university qualifications, or ii) current or 
                  former holders of selected skilled migrant visas to stay in Singapore 
                  for up to one year to facilitate their job search in Singapore. The EPEC
                   is issued on a one-time basis and is non-renewable.</p>
              <p>Now, let us 
                  look at some universities which are accepted by MOM from China and 
                  India, the two largest source of foreigners to Singapore:</p>
              <p><strong>China:</strong></p>
              <p>BeiHang University</p>
              <p>Beijing Institute of Technology</p>
              <p>Beijing Normal University</p>
              <p>Central South University</p>
              <p>Central University For Nationalities</p>
              <p>China Agricultural University</p>
              <p><strong>India:</strong></p>
              <p>Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh</p>
              <p>Dr BR Ambedkar National Institute of Technology, Jalandhar</p>
              <p>Anna University, Madras</p>
              <p>Asian College of Journalism, Chennai</p>
              <p>Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi</p>
              <p>Bangalore University, Bangalore</p>
              <p>Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS), Pilani</p>
              <p><strong>Graduates
                   from these unknown universities are allowed to stay in Singapore for a 
                  year to compete directly with Singaporeans for job in an already 
                  saturated job market.</strong></p>
              <p>Is the PAP helping Singaporeans or foreigners find jobs? Or are these universities better than NUS, NTU or SMU?</p>
              <p>Obviously
                   if a China or India graduate comes to Singapore and is willing to 
                  accept lower than market-rate wages which will translate to a bounty 
                  back home, it is impossible to expect cost-conscious employers to 
                  recruit more expensive Singapore graduates.</p>
              <p>How can the PAP expect
                   Singaporeans to compete with the foreigners when the odds are stacked 
                  against them? The playing field is tilted in favor of the foreign 
                  workers.</p>
              <p><strong>The most amazing thing is that these foreign graduates 
                  are able to step foot onto Singapore to find a job without having to 
                  pass a mandatory English proficiency test like the internationally 
                  accepted IELTS which explained why there are so many foreigners in the 
                  service industry who cannot utter a single word of English at all.</strong></p>
              <p>Are
                   we still a cosmopolitan city with English as its lingua franca or have 
                  we been turned into some third-tier city in inner China unwittingly by 
                  the PAP?</p>
              <p><strong>With discriminatory manpower schemes like EPEC, E and 
                  S-passes still operating under the auspices of the Manpower Ministry, 
                  can Singaporeans trust the PAP leaders’ promise to reduce the inflow of 
                  foreigners into Singapore?</strong></p>
              <p>Singaporeans are getting a very bad 
                  deal from the PAP government. They are elected and paid by taxpayers to 
                  take care of Singapore citizens and not foreigners.</p>
              <p><strong>Foreign 
                  workers should only be employed strictly in sectors shunned by locals 
                  such as the construction and marine engineering industries. They have 
                  absolutely no business in positions which can be easily filled up by 
                  locals.</strong></p>
              <p>Singapore workers are highly sought after in the world 
                  because of our bilingual capability, work ethic and productivity which 
                  explains why New Zealand launched a campaign lately specifically to 
                  target Singaporeans to work, live and study there and NOT China, India 
                  or Philipines.</p>
              <p><strong>Instead of showing that it appreciates and 
                  treasures the local workforce, the PAP seeks to replace them by cheap 
                  foreign workers overtly and covertly. This is completely unacceptable 
                  coming from a government which claims that it has the “mandate” of the 
                  people.</strong></p>
              <p>Did Singaporeans give it the “mandate” to bring in so many
                   foreigners into our country within such a period of time thereby 
                  causing so many problems as a result?</p>
              <p>Why are we constantly being 
                  asked to make sacrifices for the gross mistakes made by the PAP which 
                  nobody, including the crippled opposition and the compliant media dare 
                  to point out?</p>
              <p>It is time that Singaporeans realize that they can 
                  never enjoy the economic rights they deserved as citizens of Singapore 
                  without first reclaiming their political rights from the PAP.</p>
              <p>There
                   is nothing wrong in having this “entitlement mentality” because 
                  Singapore males waste two years of their precious lives in service of 
                  the nation. We are entitled no less than a level playing field for us to
                   compete with the foreigners on an equal footing.</p>
              <p>If the PAP or 
                  rather FAP (Foreigners Action Party) is not keen or able to protect the 
                  interests of Singaporeans, then perhaps we should consider switching 
                  allegiance to another political party which is more amenable to our 
                  requests in the next general election.</p>

It is therefore a very lame excuse to alway take the worrying that without foreigners, we all die, that should not be the case, if you dun do it, how do you know, Singapore is built without foreigners. We are the people who can face up to tough and dirty times, we dun mind even to go back to 3rd world if we are happy within ourselves as a family. Tell me, do you like strangers in your house even tho this strangers help you with your housework and income??</p>

              <p>Yes, there's no magic bullet but we need to have people who are honest and can account to the citizens what are the true nature of the problems, instead of hiding everything from us. If I need to die in this hell hole, pray, at least tell me what am I dying for.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
              <p>Yes, there will be major shakeups, I believe, over a period of time, but not immediate. There will have to be changes and some of it might be more painful than the rule of PAPist. That's because some issues have to be addressed and the PAPist are not addressing it and have left them to fester.</p>
              <p>The Gini coefficient of Singapore is one of the worst in the world, so I'm not sure what kind of economy decline is it possible for Sinkapore to have right now. I think Sinkapore economy have not benefitted our local countrymen enough to be even called an economy at all. It had only benefitted the PAPist so that they can have a pay rise next year. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p><strong><a href="http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/news/singapore/4250-another-bear-sighting-this-time-at-bukit-panjang">Singapore Democrats</a><br> 17 Oct 2010</strong></p>
              <p>There were reports of a bear-like creature sighted this morning at 
              Bukit Panjang. This follows a bear sighting at Ulu Pandan last week 
              where fuzzy pictures of a black bear rummaging through a trashbin was 
              posted on the Internet, setting online tongues a-wagging.</p>
              <p>This morning residents at Bukit Panjang were similarly alarmed where 
              they saw another furry creature that also resembled a bear. They peered 
              to get a better look at the…whatever it was that was huddling in the 
              corner. The children also stared intently and didn’t quite know how to 
              react. Then as it ambled towards the crowd, the people readied 
              themselves…</p>
              <p><strong>…to greet Danny the Democracy Bear!</strong></p>
              <p>Danny is the latest addition to the SDP 
              family. His membership was unanimously approved by party members. He has
               special communication skills and wants to do his part to promote the 
              message of democracy in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Danny joined his party mates today to do their Sunday walkabout and 
              selling The New Democrat. He was, of course, the star of the event 
              turning heads wherever he went.</p>
              <p>Clad in party colours with the words ‘I LOVE SDP’ emblazoned across 
              his T-shirt, Danny was an instant hit with the folks at Bukit Panjang as
               he introduced himself and made his way around the breakfast tables.</p>
              <p>He made even more friends with the little ones as he carried a basket
               full of candy and lollipop, and invited them to help themselves.</p>
              <p>Like bees to honey, kids swarmed around the lovable SDP member and 
              wanted to squeeze his nose and poke his tummy. Many stopped to take a 
              picture with him. Even a 70-year-old uncle could not resist taking a 
              photograph with him.</p>
              <p>“You’re so old already,” the missus reminded.</p>
              <p>“Never mind, lah. He’s so friendly,” Uncle beamed as he asked his son to snap the picture for him.</p>
              <p>It was quite a sight to behold as Danny walked about the market place
               and greeted shoppers. We believe he is the first bear to enter into the
               political scene in Singapore, although this will have to be verified 
              with the Registry of Societies.</p>
              <p>As Danny went about his business, the other members went about 
              theirs: selling The New Democrat and meeting residents. The Singapore 
              Democrats have been working hard at Bukit Panjang in preparation for the
               coming contest with Dr Teo Ho Pin of the PAP. The party has also been 
              doing house visits around the estate.</p>
              <p>Day or night, weekday or weekend, the SDP has been working at full 
              tilt to bring its message across to the electorate. We have been 
              visiting Bukit Panjang and the surrounding area for years.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.sgpolitics.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/bear-reading.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>Many of the residents are upset at the high cost of living. 
              Housewives, especially, complain about the dollar buying fewer and fewer
               items at the market. One told us that the GST is adding to their bills 
              and that she thinks that the PAP will increase the tax after the next 
              general elections.</p>
              <p>As hard as we are working, it is tough competing with the PAP 
              candidate. This is not because he is any better or more competent. With 
              the state media blacking out our news and blasting out the PAP’s at 
              every turn, the contest cannot be more biased. The SDP has to work ten 
              times as hard just to draw even.</p>
              <p>But the Singapore Democrats have never shied away from hardwork and 
              we continue to pound away in the cosntituency to tell the people of the 
              urgent need for a competent, constructive and caring opposition in 
              Parlaiment so that their voices can be heard.</p>
              <p>With the addition of Danny, our workload has been made a little lighter.</p>
