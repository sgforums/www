                                       and also plus interest paid to bank around S$100k more. They need a 
                                      more manageable amount to survive.</p>
              <p>Third world country people are
                                       grabbing everything from normal workers all the way to managers with a 
                                      willingness to take very low pay for those jobs. The local youngs 
                                      without much working experience gets sidelined by those foreigners and 
                                      the anger has now exploded into gang fights with aimless youth. The 
                                      future is bleak for all citizens if this trend continue. The original 
                                      purpose of attracting companies to set up base here to provided jobs for
                                       locals have been lost.</p>
              <p>To add to the woe of citizens, new flats 
                                      are finished in 2 to 3 years time and even if young couples queue for 
                                      those flats, the amount of flats are so little that young people are 
                                      being forced to buy old resale flats.The occupiers of current resale 
                                      flats are sometimes also third world foreigners who have plans to return
                                       home after a few years of work here. Some of these flats can sell for 
                                      more than S$500k, so when those people go home to their third world 
                                      country, they become instant millionaires.</p>
              <p>So all those people 
                                      will become millionaires, when our people, even the young has to pay for
                                       it. I don't remember Sinkapore being a international charity 
                                      organisation. We lose our jobs, our homes and even our meaning of being a
                                       citizen, and the young have to serve 2 years of National Services 
                                      defending the PAPist regime. Why do we have to be pawns at the hands of a
                                       government that suppress free speech, the right to hold lawful assembly
                                       and delibrately control the press and every conceivable instruments to 
                                      ensure that they stay in power and breed their own cronies to control 
                                      state linked companies who also prefer cheap third world workers, 
                                      enriching their own pockets while destroying the lives of citizens who 
                                      prop up their bastard regime and their enlightened despot LKY.</p>
              <p>The government own Sinkapore, period. 90% of the land in Sinkapore are owned by the government through the Land acquisition Act which paid peanuts to the the owners for it. Because of that they should provide proper housings for locals that ensure that locals do not have to worry about that problem and focus on work. Instead the government went and enriched its own coffers, pegging public housing to private properties prices.</p>
              <p>All utilities and major companies are still owned by the government despite claims of having being privatised. There's a saying, " If you open a company in Sinkapore, you will have to compete with the government." Most are owned indirectly by Temasick Holdings chaired by the daughter-in-law of the enlightened despot LKY who routinely lost hundreds of millions of dollars through lousy investments, together with another by proxy money bag of the government,  GICee which is chaired by the famous despot. Btw, GICee is also regularly in a festive mood to lose lots of taxpayers money through lousy investments. What's worst those two jokers (LKY and his daughter in law) are still there, not fired, what kind of accountability do we have? Even the Congress is looking for people to punish for the US financial meltdown.  The government is driven entirely by profits and their own PAPist party survival and will not help citizens. They will stand and watch us die, slowly and surely without even the slightest shred of remorse at the hideousness of their own crimes.</p>
              <p>If the oppositions ever gain power and investigate the doings of the PAPist, some of the people in PAPist will be in trouble, I can bet my bottom dollar on that. That's why the PAPist will rather destroy this country than face punishment and humiliation at the hands of those that they once suppressed.</p>
