Good result is GPA 3.5&lt;<br><br>On top of good rssult, going to University via the Poly route also uses your O Level result.<br><br>The computation is 80% Poly result and 20% O level result.<br><br>2. Yes, SP is one of the most established Polytechnics in Singapore. Another will be NP. If you have the grade and motivations, you wouldn't need to afraid of competition. A piece of advice from me is, do you 1000% in poly, every test/exam COUNTS.<br><br>3. It depend on what you want to do in future field. Some field of engineering are in popular so it's difficult to get in. While someone field are less popular and competitive, people can get into the course easily.<br><br>If you want to go into Uni by a Business diploma, It will be easy because you'll have the basics of accountings. I am not sure about fashion course.<br><br>Almost all poly diploma can get you into a business course in Uni. But with business diploma, it can be an advantage.<br><br>4. Yes, business can be very useful in term of jobs opportunities. Business course is dealing with tonnes and tonnes of numbers. Better start getting good grades for your O Level POA first. Flip open your Sat classified section and you'll see tonnes of job opportunities for accounting diplomas holder.<br><br>To get into business or fashion designer is your choice. Sit down and think seriously what you want to do in 5 to 10  years time.<br><br>Do visit the polytechnics and universities website to see the job prospects.<br><br>Wish you luck  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>my advice is do not base your course selection just because there is high demand in the industry now.<br><br>12 years ago there were too many lawyers and intake was reduced, 7 years later there became a shortage. 10 years ago IT is hot stuff till the dot-com burst, and IT became cheap stuff. Now there is a shortage of accounting grads... currently nus, ntu, smu and many private schools are rapidly churning out lots of accounting grads. accounting grads in the BIG 4 comparatively receive 30% less starting pay as compare to their peers in engineering.<br><br>follow your interests so u will not regret it in the future. nevertheless it is never too late to change. btw, your other options (fashion design, tourism, hospitality management) shows good economic potential in the future, esp in singapore.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>With a polytechnic diploma, you can earn perhaps $2,000 a month, but options for further education (that means university) will remain very limited due to your premature specialisation. Be smart, take the JC route and keep your options open. You sound very indecisive so if I were you, I wouldn't think that picking my career path right now would be a sane thing to do.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>A diploma is in actuality worth less than an advanced level certificate. Think about it.</div>
