            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Taiwan in crisis as Chen re-elected and opposition demands annulment</strong></span></span><br><br><img src="http://us.news2.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/afp/20040320/capt.sge.uuw25.200304181217.photo00.default-389x263.jpg"><br><br>TAIPEI (AFP) - Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian was re-elected by a wafer-thin majority, but the island was plunged into uncertainty after the opposition demanded the election be annulled.<br><br>The Central Election Commission declared Chen the winner by less than 30,000 votes, but the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said too many questions remained over an assassination attempt against Chen just hours before the polls.<br><br>The KMT also said it was concerned about the large number of spoiled ballot papers, over 337,000. The party lodged lawsuits to try to have the election result overturned as angry supporters gathered around courts and its leaders staged a silent sit-in outside their campaign headquarters.<br><br>Commission head Huang Shih-cheng said Chen polled 6,471,970 votes compared to 6,442,452 for Lien after a turnout of around 80 percent -- by far the closest election on Taiwan since martial law was lifted in 1987.<br><br><img src="http://us.news2.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/afp/20040320/capt.sge.uuw25.200304181217.photo01.default-320x384.jpg"><br><br>A visibly angry KMT leader Lien Chan demanded more than 13,000 ballot boxes be sealed for a recount and cast doubt on the shooting incident when Chen and Vice President Annette Lu were injured during final campaigning Friday.<br><br>"It's not a fair election. Prepare to apply to annul the election," Lien, 67, told supporters. "So far yesterday's shooting has never been clearly explained."<br><br>The authorities said Chen, 53, and Lu, 59, both suffered minor bullet wounds after a mystery attacker fired at least two shots as the pair travelled in an open-topped jeep during final campaigning in the southern town of Tainan.<br><br>The two candidates had been running neck and neck leading up to the election, and analysts had suggested the apparent assassination attempt could bring out a sympathy vote for the president.<br><br>Chen, whose Democratic Progressive Party favours pushing for formal independence for Taiwan, said the result was a victory for the island's vibrant but still fledgling democracy.<br><br>"This is not a personal or party victory but the victory for democracy and the Taiwan people," he said.<br><br>Chen also held out an olive branch to the ruling Communist Party in Beijing, which still claims the island off its southern coast as sovereign Chinese territory even though Taiwan has been ruled separately for over 50 years.<br><br>"I urge the Chinese authorities to face the election and the referendum with a positive attitude and accept the choices of the Taiwanese people," said Chen.<br><br>The election was held after an acrimonious campaign characterized by negative campaiging and bitter debate over Chen's decision to hold a controversial referendum on relations with China alongside the poll.<br><br>The referendum -- fiercely denounced by China -- asked voters to back government plans to strengthen military defences against some 500 Chinese missiles pointed at the island and a push for peace talks.<br><br>In a blow to Chen, the two referendums were ruled invalid after less than 50 percent of eligible voters cast their ballots.<br><br>But Chen said the holding of the island's first-ever referendums was a giant step forward for Taiwanese democracy. "We want Beijing to understand Taiwanese people's needs and withdraw missiles and reopen dialogue," he added.<br><br>China has yet to react to the election or referendum result. However Beijing is extremely suspicious of Chen and has repeatedly warned that any attempt to take the island towards formal independence would trigger an invasion.<br><br>But Taiwan's biggest ally, the United States, congratulated Taiwan's people for turning out in such great numbers and said it was confident people would remain calm as the legal disputes were resolved.<br><br>The result capped two days of unforeseen tension and drama.<br><br>Police said they were continuing their investigation into Friday's shooting. They have recovered two homemade bullets, probably fired from a handgun.<br><br>Rewards totalling 33 million Taiwan dollars (697,000 US) have so far been offered including 10 million from both parties, 10 million from police and three million from the Tainan city government.<br><br>Chen and Lu were hurt as they were driven in a motorcade past ranks of cheering supporters in Tainan during the final day of campaigning. Chen was hit in the stomach while Lu's right knee was grazed.<br><br>Senior officials said the shooting had nothing to do with China, which had attempted to intimidate voters not to back pro-independence candidates before previous elections by firing missiles and engaging in tough rhetoric.<br><br>Taiwan has fended off its larger rival's claims to reunification for more than five decades but now faces a crucial new period of close economic links, but growing political antipathy.<br><br>Beijing has condemned the "splittist" leadership of Chen, which it sees as preparing the ground for an eventual permanent break from the mainland.<br><br>The KMT lost its 51-year grip on power when Chen secured a narrow victory in 2000 on an anti-China, anti-corruption ticket and capitalised on a split within KMT ranks.<br><br>Chen's referendum was criticised by France, Japan, Germany, the European Union and, most crucially, by the United States.<br></div>
