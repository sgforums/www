            <div class='col-md body'>here's her reason why she jumped....still very sad case....<br><br><strong>'I have cancer and I don't want to burden the family' </strong><br>Madam Yap calls her husband in Thailand, says this, hangs up and then jumps, her two daughters tied to her with red string<br><br>By K. C. Vijayan and Tanya Fong<br><br>THE woman who jumped to her death along with her two daughters on Wednesday was suffering from cancer, and is believed to have been planning her death for some time.<br><br>Madam Yap Cheng Chui was believed to have had cancer of the womb, and had sought treatment at a Singapore hospital after flying here last Friday from Thailand, where she lived with her husband and their two children.<br><br>She probably found out about her disease while in Thailand, and it is likely that she flew here to commit suicide.<br><br>A note recovered by police from her hotel room indicated that she was depressed because of her illness.<br><br>Madam Yap, 34, a housewife, moved to Thailand from Singapore after marrying Mr Nicholas Oliver Prud'hon, 26, a French national of Vietnamese-Thai descent, about five years ago.<br><br>He taught French at a school for gifted children, and the couple had two girls, Kathleen, three, and Calista, two.<br><br>But while in Singapore, she behaved normally and did not seem troubled, said staff at the Hotel 81 in Chinatown, where she stayed with her girls while here.<br><br>She was always well-dressed in cheongsams, and left the hotel at about 10 each morning with her daughters.<br><br>Staff said she was also very courteous, and greeted them each day. Her daughters were polite, they added, and always said thank you when plied with sweets.<br><br>But on Wednesday, Madam Yap picked out Block 53 in Chin Swee Road - a stone's throw from the hotel - apparently because it was the tallest building in her line of sight from the hotel, left her room, and never came back.<br><br>Shortly after leaving the room, at about 11am, she called her husband in Thailand and gave him an indication of what was to come.<br><br>In a phone call, she told him: 'I have cancer and I don't want to burden the family. That's why I'm going.'<br><br>Her call set off a panic. Mr Prud'hon tried calling her back a few times, but got no response.<br><br>He then called his in-laws, who were in Thailand.<br><br>All three made futile attempts to contact her, and finally decided to catch the first available flight here.<br><br>But it was too late.<br><br>While they were trying to call her, Madam Yap went to the 25th floor of the 26-storey block, pushed a table against the parapet, tied her daughters' wrists to hers with red string, and jumped.<br><br>Her husband and parents only found out what happened when they arrived in Singapore late on Wednesday, and police gave them the grim news.<br><br>The shock discovery told on them at the morgue yesterday morning.<br><br>Both Mr Prud'hon and his mother-in-law came close to collapsing when the bodies of Madam Yap and the two toddlers were released, and sobbed uncontrollably throughout.<br><br>At the funeral service at Mount Vernon Crematorium yesterday afternoon, Mr Prud'hon tried to clamber into his wife's coffin, while screaming out her name.<br><br>Reflecting the rushed nature of the proceedings, the service was kept simple and brief, and there were no wreaths or photographs fronting the coffins.<br><br>Madam Yap's mother was similarly grief-stricken.<br><br>At the funeral, she cried loudly throughout, and cradled her dead daughter's face and planted kisses on her cheeks. She also pressed her teary cheeks against her grandchildren's coffins and wailed loudly.<br><br>As his wife's coffin was being closed to be brought to the incineration furnace, relatives had to restrain Mr Prud'hon, who reached into the casket and held onto her.<br><br>Meanwhile, Madam Yap's mother wailed in Cantonese: 'Why are you so stupid? Do you know how much I love you? Do you know how sad you have made me?'<br><br></div>
