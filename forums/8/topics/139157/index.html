Do such incidents still happen nowadays?<br><br>Discuss</div></blockquote>I'm sure such incidents will still happen in Singapore, just that we're not there to witness it.<br><br>Of course the driver or conductors knew that they shouldn't be rude to anyone else including the patrons, but they chose to ignore their righteous for that split second cos they knew that it would make them happy if they can abuse and flex their authority once in a while. You can't help but hate them if you happened to witness such incidents...take note and do not end up like them.<br><br>Singaporeans are arrogant and it is the truth. Very rarely would you find a humble Singaporean out there. And even if you do find one, they're either indecisive or waiting for someone to lead them through their lives. And they have no righteousness in their heart/mind/soul.<br><br>Disappointing? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I don't think anyone can truly say that they're proud to be a Singaporean when they can't even think of anything about Singapore that they're truly proud of. Most of the time, Singaporeans are only proud of themselves/their achievements and not of Singapore. Ask Singaporeans if they have any hope which they carries with them everyday, and they'll tell you that their hope is all about themselves. How many Singaporeans actually know any histories of Singapore itself? I think most of us know more about the World Wars than our own country's histories. And that explains why we don't have a sense of belonging, cos we don't have an identity.<br><br>For those who take buses or mrt everyday, take a chance to have a good observation of the fellow Singaporean passengers around you. Who and how many of those passengers have hope in their eyes? It's not about tired and still half-awake or sleepy, it's the confidence that's missing from the eyes, looks of everyone and it's probably the cause of this massive depression that is taking over everyone right now.<br><br>We need hope for our future first before there's hope for our country. But right now it seems that our country have a brighter future and hopes than it's people. Hahahaha...what will happen to our country without it's people's support in the future?<br><br>Can we have dreams about our future with hopes and confidence?<br></div>

He started mumbling to himself or whatever..then started quarrelling with the bus driver.  If i dun remember wrongly, he was scolding all those vulgarities.  This agitated the driver and he asked him to get out of the bus...the old man suddenly ran forward (I was sitting juz behind the driver, if u know what I mean) and the bus driver stopped the bus at the road, then they fought.  They almost hit me lor, coz they were fighting directly in front of me.  Another man in uniform came forward and helped, then they threw the old man out of the bus.<br><br>Another incident was about 2 years ago also, a girl in ITE uniform tapped her ezlink card and then there was no value, but she din bother to search for coins or watever, juz proceeded to the end of the bus.  Then everyone boarded but the driver refused to move.  He shouted to the girl and asked her to pay.  very harsh lor.  Everyone was on going to work/sch mah, why delay everyone bcos of one passenger?  </span></div>

But he can tell them nicely and not shout. What if there was a FT or Ang Mo sitting inside the bus? He will get a bad impression of Singaporeans.<br><br>On another note what if the girl or guy was an Ang Mo, will the bus driver still shout at him or her? 99.9% he wont shout cause to him locals are meant to be treated like sh^t....He will also be afraid of Ang mo complaining to SBS and getting him into trouble....<br>In other words the bus driver may just be contracdicting himself if he says he is just doing his job. And the way he does his job is also in the wrong way. It no longer becomes his job, it becomes harrassment. Dont u all guys agree with me?</div>
