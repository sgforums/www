            <div class='col-md body'>No, this post is not to flame Raffles. I like Raffles. You may or may not agree with my point of view, but I personally don't care.<br>Fine, maybe I do care. A little bit. Not enough to kill people for badmouthing it or disliking it -- many of my (non-Rafflesian) friends don't like Rafflesians in general. Even some RAFFLESIANS don't like Rafflesians in general. However, I'd like to clear up some stuff based on what I hope is an unbiased opinion.<br><br><strong>1) It is not being a Rafflesian that makes (some) Rafflesians behave the way they behave</strong><br>It's their life before secondary school/JC that makes them who they are. If they are pampered by parents and constantly praised (to an exaggerated extent) by their teachers, they most probably <span style="font-style: italic;">will</span> become brats/arrogant people irregardless which school they go to.<br>Also, they must have high IQ or at least must be able to score well on tests to get into Raffles. This means that they've probably had something to be proud of before they ever became Rafflesians.<br><br><strong>2) Singapore society is greatly focused on marks and schools and positions</strong><br>This tends to make people from "good" schools have a lot of pride in their school. There's nothing wrong with that until they start looking down on others who may not be as academically forward as they are. It doesn't really help how some adults tend to constantly praise those who go to good schools or get good marks. I'm not saying that it's excusable for people to look down on others, but it's not just a Rafflesian thing. If _________ (insert school of your choice) gained as much attention as Raffles does academically and in sports, I believe that people from that school would have the same mentality as some Rafflesians do.<br><br><strong>3) Rafflesians' "wrongs" are generally magnified, while their "rights" are overlooked.</strong><br>People are people. Simply because some may score better on tests doesn't mean that those who are given more priviledges must be perfect. We would hope that they would be able to use their brains, but people make mistakes and we must accept it. Mmm, some "interesting" news about RJC has been coming up. I won't say recently, but I think you guys all know what I'm talking about -ahem, WSM-. However, WSM is ONE person, while there are around 3000 people in Raffles (combining all the schools) [I think]. She said something rather inappropriate, and ... well ... I guess people really focused on what she said. But what about everyone else out there? Don't tell me that people outside of Raffles don't use their blogs to flame others/to post inappropriate pictures/whatever. What about things that Rafflesians have done to actually help society? No one really talks about it when they are considerate or are generous or whatever. People generally like to focus on other's faults.<br><br><strong>4) Yes, I admit that some Rafflesians really aren't wonderful people to befriend</strong> but that is true for all schools. There are nice people in the world, and there are people who needta keep working on it. It isn't just Rafflesians.<br><br>Yeah, basically, that's my view.<br>Okay, I said that I'd try not to be biased, and really, I'm trying.<br>But yeah.</div>
