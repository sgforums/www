              <p>you know I really wonder when indians are gonna prosper. its so disgusting, my isides  cringe everytime I see this kind of shit. can you chinese please insult us then maybe we'll realise how stupid we look and leave our retarded mentality behind.</p>
              <p>I was always happy to be a singaporean indian. far... far... away from the loathesome attitudes of india and indians with their mindless superstitions and their liking for their wierd indian movie industry.</p>
              <p>how their appreciation for moving pictures is only restricted to cheap... cheap... comedy. its so cheap its like dog piss and pig dung. they always must have song sequences, the very lame comedy, the whole masala feel-goodness and the potrayal of the ugliest vomit inducing disgusting looking indian men you can find with the most lightest indian women. is there some sort of a scheme here?</p>

              <p>the indian movie industry excluding bollywood (which is just trash thats better because it has more funding, is pan-indian, a global audience and better looking cast)</p>
              <p>our movie industry speaks volumes of our intelligence and creativity.</p>

              <p>is that what happens when you divide people of a society according to caste? is this what happens when you mix pure caucasoids with australoids?</p>
              <p>australoid tribal peoples of india mixed with pure indians</p>

              <p>you can see how their noses are broad...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>what pure lighter skinned south indians look like</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.webindia123.com/personality/men/ashmit_patel/ashmit.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>even in a place like singapore with a chance to prove our fowardness, be creative and artistic indians are still clinging on to their backwardness. recently we were given our own channel, vasantham. but now the channel has devolved into some india mama channel. they speak like india people, cast retarded india actors in some of their dramas. they target audience is for all the foreign india buggers. you'd think that india people migrating here will become more modernised and leave their shitty mentality behind. but unfortunately their influencing on our choices, vasantham seems to cater to india buggers rather than making some good shows that singaporean indians can watch and benefit.</p>
              <p>why are'nt we like whites?</p>
              <p>yellow people have perfected in the art of imitating the aryan man. koreans make such great movies of artistic value and get so much respect in pusan film festival.</p>
              <p>what's heart breaking is that singaporean indians who diss india indians are the ones that really watch all the chee bai indian movies. its so gross, uck! makes me sick. all the stupid running around coconut trees and the actors in it are making movies to glorify themselves.</p>

              <p>are we the same people who are descendants of the indus civilisations? I am doubting it. when is a revolution going to take place? why are indians so unfortunate to co-exist in a nation with australoids who are now being integrated into mainstream society under the pretence of globalisation/urbanisation. we have some australoid admixture. australoids make up a large part of indian population, if they are going to integrate, inter marry with indians, pretty soon indians will become like this.</p>
