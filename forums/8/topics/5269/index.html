But hope you guys will respond.<br><br>Just wondering if you guys had made any really good friends via the net and then meeting them, irregardless of whether they're of the same sex or not, though I know usually they're of the opposite.  =)<br>Personally I've met a few... and well they haven't exactly become great friends. ( Well... maybe the problem's with me of course!! )<br><br>And also, before meeting a net friends, I know all of us have certain expectations, try as we might not to be branded bastards or bitches... but well... guess it's natural. So has your net friend ever risen up to the occasion???<br><br>badboy<br><br>" A bad-looking friend may not necessarily be a bad friend! "<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, i know most people would be against such relationships/friendships, but personally, i've met a great bunch of friends frm the net, of the same sex and opp. net friends, are usually no dif frm normal frens, as... sg is so small, it's so easy to play 6degrees! somehow or another, you're bound to find out tt your classmate's sister's fren goes to the same church as your netfriend's cousin's classmate, etc. you get my drift.<br><br>it's absolutely natural to assume the best of your netfriend, and i dont recall anyone exactly meeting my expectations (or rather my vision of a dream guy) but the main thing is, you gotta accept the person for what he is, and not condemn him because of ideals you forced upon him. but it's true that often, you get a bit of a shock because your net friend doesnt resemble his net persona at all! ... scary situation to be in.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well Ataraxia...<br><br>I guess you're right. We shouldn't expect too much sometimes. Accept the person as he or her should be right? hmmmm I guess sometimes it's easier said than done, even though people go around saying " I don't really care about looks " , well, how many of them, if any, truly mean it?? I wonder...<br><br>badboy<br><br>" I don't hope for bad things to happen to others, but why are bad things happening to me??? "</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have met a couple of ICQ friends, and one even came from Japan to visit me in SG. Well, most of them I have seen their pics so I roughly know how they look like. Maybe I have not met an unexcepionally good looking one, but the one from Japan is not bad with his long locks and cool looks...<br><br>I do have lots of good net friends, but sometimes it is better to remain as net friends cos things might not turn out the way you wanted like for eg. one like the other and the other dun like the other. Unless, U have reached a stage whereby the friendship is so good that you want to proceed futher.</div>
