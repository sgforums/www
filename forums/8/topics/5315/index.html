            <div class='col-md body'>I wanna help but I think ur story is a little vague and it is like u are too hateful put it in the right pieces. But I understand when u are talking about relatives like these. I have very rich relatives who sorta "look down" on my family cos we belonged to the middle class...They drive merc and live in big houses but they dun care about their own siblings at all.How sad!I mean in a family if U dun love ur brother or sister, if u dun protect them like u should. It is not a family anymore.<br><br>I want to prove to my so called blood relation relatives that someone in my family can be successful and yet not a snob like them.Of cos I will not use money to throw at thei faces. But I really want them to know that money is not everything. It is like if not for my grandmas who are still alive, I dun think that we ever see one another,(except during Chinese Lunar New Year).<br><br>To me, to forgive is the sweetest revenge.Cos they will be old one day, and if you return evil for good, they will be guilt-stridken for the rest of their lives. This is psychogical, but U can forgive but U can never forget.<br><br>All I can say is forgive them but remember what they have done and not follow their footsteps.It is up to U how u wanna treat them in future but if u think of taking a physical revenge...it will be never-ending...<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I know exactly what u are talking about...even though ur post is a little vague...couldn't really understand much of ur sentences...but I got the gist of it.<br><br>I also have a problem like this except no so bad...My cousins family are in the lower middle calss range but always try to look rich...My family being from the middle clas range...except that they look down on us!!!???  Why?  Because they think that we have lost our roots because we can speak English a little bit too well...and also must have a bit to do with the fact that my dad is British...They always like to talk about my dad behind our backs even though he's so active in helping out every single one of them when they need it...When they wanted to open a restaurant, they borrowed $200, 000 from muy parents and not even a word of thanks...and they acted so ungratefulll...even we go to the restaurant, they still make us pay...(hey, basically we own the restaurant...so why?)...and some more, they don't want our advice on running the place...some more can still say things about our family...then When we came to Singapore,both my gand,mothers went to live with them...but when my mom went to visit a year later, Both my grandmothers were in terrible shape...they were sick and underfed..and obviously weren't being payed any attention of any kind...my one grandmother was really sick and had infections here and there, but they were too cheap to send her to hospital yet can still buy 2 new cars while we were away...and can still take the money that we send them every month to help pay for my grandmas...Obviously they use it for everything else but on our grandmas...:-(<br><br>Our family was soooo angry...how can they treat their own flesh and blood like this?  So, we set out a plan for when i go to Uni there...I would get my own place and the two grandmothers would live with me, and I would be the one taking care of them...send them to thte hosiptal, give them medicine, cooktheir food, and what have you...And i was just one person because my parents would be in Singapore for another two years...and my stupid cousins family was a family of 8 people...yet none of them could find the time...why?  some more can still say bad things about us...When I saw the condition that my grandma was in i was so sad I almost cried...<br><br>Anyway, they stayed with me for the year that i was in Uni and both their conditions improved drastically and almost immediately because They just needed medical attention and some family care...what is so difficult about that?  To think that they call themselves asians and blast us for losing our roots...from where I'm sitting, my roots are still a lot stronger than any of them...:-(<br><br>And definately they were so much happier living with me...When I came back to singapore, they came back to live with us here for another year or two before the whole fmaily went back...leaving me here this time...ha ha:-)<br><br>Anyway, my parents refused to let them take care of my grandmothers again...not ever...so they lived with my family....Then we got cheated by their family members...my brother saved up enpugh money to buy a car but got it cheated from him by my cousin...and got no car...:-(  I also got into trouble helping out my cousin...a lot...Then my dad had to help them when they got into legal trouble and shit like that....Yet they can still look down on us...<br><br>I respect my dad so much because It's not even his own blood that he's suffering for...and he gets no respect for it...he has helped ebvery single one of their family members in one way or another...yet they still blame him for taking away our asian roots...BS....The things I hear that they say about him and our family is so bad...that's why I don't want to be associated with them anymore...i haven't called them or seen them for so long already...i think that we tried...even my brother was telling me that blood is thicker than water and we should give them another chance...but it was obvious that we felt we loved them, but we knew that it would never work to accept them anymore...their family and mine don't mix anymore...<br><br>It's so sad because we are now without a community...we belong to no group or such because they look down upon us for being educated...That's why so many of them are in really low paying jobs and uneduacted, and uninformed about everything...yet can still look down on us...<br><br>How do people think in this world...Anyway, we feel very betrayed by it all.....<br><br>I know what u are saying Kojun, but don't let this turn into hate...Just don't have anything to do with them...blood or no blood ...they aren't worthy to be called family...Don't even bother to send any money or what...Since they never treated u as family, don't act as family...but don't hate them or do anything hateful to them...<br><br>Just wipe ur mind and forget that they exist...I can't stand this kind of people...equal to child molestors because they rape ur trust in the family unit...Beleiev me that u don't matter to them...they only come to u for money for the funeral becasue they don't want to pay for it themselves...the way they treated u and ur family, u cna see that they don't care about family at all...So why would they act like a family to a "family member' that just died...Obviously they won't take responsibility for it......<br><br>Just take it easy...and do what rinoa say...don't let hate take over...because that's how one becomes converted to the dark side of the force...by giving way to ur anger and hate...</div>
