(we think laser she said coz no scar or cuts will be inflicted) she told us the op will be 9th dec, 10 am... and the doc said that she did not haf to stay in the hosp...<br><br>when we called her home yesterday (9th dec) at ard 7pm, apparently someone picked up the fone but did not make a sound. and when we called the 2nd time, no one answered the fone. then we called her HP, still no answer. BUT, she managed to gather all her strength to SMS us to tell us that she was on her way home from the op and was very tired so did not answer the fone. we replied that we'll be visiting her today (10th), and she said ok.. so we kinda think dat her op's real and dat it was quite bad 4 us to suspect her...<br><br>so a fren tried calling her a few times in the morning today to ask her how she was, no answers for a few times...but ltr she finally answered and said she was tired, so my fren just said that we'll be gng ltr and asked her to rest well... but when we called again at abt 5 just now, her mum answered the fone... my fren asked her a few qns..<br><br>"auntie, where's XXX?"<br><br>"she went to see doc coz she got flu.."<br><br>my fren still suspecting, asked her... "so how's XXX op?"<br><br>"ok lah.. she said she lost a lot of blood and the doc gave her 3 packs of blood.. then the doc asked her to go for the op 2 days earlier, she came back on sunday afternoon"<br><br>my fren was so shocked when she heard this coz we saw her in church on sunday morning!!!<br>"then yesterday (9th) leh? did she go out?"<br><br>"no leh, she was home the whole day watching TV..."<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
