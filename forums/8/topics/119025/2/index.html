TOEFL wasn't so bad but SAT was a killer for me. IF you are looking to get into the Ivy Leagues, then you have to get around 1500 and above for that test lor...the total score is 1600...800 for the Math and another 800 for the English section<br><br>Other requirements, will depend on the school you want to get into, so research carefully on the major you want and choose the school accordingly lor.<br><br>Hmm as for the cost...I guess if you choose a city school it will be more expensive as the living expenses there will be higher.<br><br>i.c.y</div>

They are always on the lookout for the 'chinks' to pick on.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">   Come on, people.  North America is almost as good (or bad) as any other place in the world.  Having travelled around the many parts of world I find Asians a little more racist and pissed of at other races.  I am Chinese Canadian (btw) and people tend to til me a little differently here (in Asia) because I speak with a different accent.  North America is a cultural melting pot and students are taught about different cultures at an early age (well, at least in Canada we do).  I find that white people are more receptive to different cultures and they try harder not to offend minorities.  I'd be very rich, if I got 20 cents everytime someone in Singapore said something racist thing.  Or made reference about a person's race because they had a disagreement with the person.  Somehow many Asians think that we have the right to b racist.</div>
