They brought out this tiny snake and everyone gasped.  Geee....it was only a worm compared to what they have in Thailand.  hahahaha....<br><br>I liked Florida because it was slower and more easy-going compared with the north.  It was a cold winter and Florida was also a good break from the sub-zero wind-chills.

I used to try to use when I am talking to the people here but I came out sounding all weird.

            <div class='col-md body'>Currently in melbourne, in the quiet town of Frankston, along the bays of Mornington Peninsula, its a very quiet place.Gd for mug for my exams and work on my assignments with no distractions..No to mention the beach, wkends are spent at the beach, suntanning at the beach ..soaking in the sun and water ..before heading to the cafes along the bay for a nice warm meal of fish and chips. And i swear the fish and chips are gd stuff. Not those Long John Silver kinda of meal,a full fillet of hake or blue grenadier in great batter, washed down with cool lemon tea.<br><br>Initally when i first arrivied, i had to get a little used to the weather, it was cooling and warm during the day, with temperatures reaching 1 degree during winter and it rained in winter, so it was pretty interesting when u could leave your food on the stove and don't bother putting it in the fridge as the weather was cold and dry. I remeber wanting to cook fried rice and you had to have over nite rice to fry.All i did was cook my rice, leave the pot open near the window and the rice was cold in 1 hr ..hehe..<br><br>And the the ppl are so friendly here. Walking to school, it really brightens your day up when ppl just say "how ya going " "G'Day mate !!" you wil walk with a bounce in your stride for the day.<br><br>Down side. u need a car to travel. And i frankly recommending ppl coming down to Australia to think abt buying one. You need to buy your groceries, as the residential areas ain't near the town and the buses are run on 1hr intervals.<br><br>I still like to return to Singapore. I still miss the food though..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Had stayed in Scotland for nearly 6 years.  The weather is often gloomy and rainy most of the time. Found it hard to get used to the weather at first and in particular the strong scottish accent which took me quite a while to dechiper what the locals were mumbling about.  I have a few english friends who also have a hard time understanding the locals during conversation.  The highlands are beautiful and for those who like nature, these are the places that worth a visit.  Overall it was a rather unique experience for me. Left scotland in 2000 and hope to visit some old friends there again sometime soon.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm in adelaide too. 3.5 yeras now. Miss the food (kopi tiams, hawker centres) in Singapore. And there's really nothing much to do here. Another one whose pass-time is looking at forums lol. It's a cool summer this year (now) so at least it's quite nice at the moment. I live near the sea, just 3-minute walk.</div>
