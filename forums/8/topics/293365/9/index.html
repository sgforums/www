None of the authorities had yet to be brave enough to step out and take responsibility for the incident....Count themselves lucky that the attention of the public and press is not on them as the nation mourn the loss of the 5 heroes....<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

And from now on, every dragon boat that sails with the Singapore flag will sail in honour of each of these fine young men."<br><br>Tears flowed freely among those present as family and friends spoke about their loved ones.<br><br>"He will continue to live in our hearts and those of you who know Reuben, I know he will continue to live in your hearts also," said ReubenÂ’s father Freddie Kee.<br><br>Choking back his tears, JeremyÂ’s brother Norman Goh said, "All five of you will have to take care of each other from now on, just like what you did in life as a team. The nation is proud of you and you all will be our champions."<br><br>Singapore dragon boat team captain Yeo Chin Hwei also paid his tribute. "Let us always remember the sunny smiles they wore, their cheerful voices in our ears.<br><br>"They were determined, passionate and unique individuals who were filial sons, caring brothers, dedicated team mates, loyal friends and devoted paddlers. Stephen, Boon San, Jeremy, Reuben, Wei Cheng, you will always live in our hearts. Brothers forever."<br><br>The ceremony lasted for about two hours, with relatives, family members, close friends and members of the public attending.<br><br>Many remembered the five dragon boat rowers as avid sportsmen with a passion for dragon boating. But as JeremyÂ’s brother said, it was unfortunate that this passion also cost them their lives.<br><br>Those present said they came to say farewell in their own way.<br><br>"I used to row dragon boat, and these (were) friends that I made along the way. So it is very tragic to hear (about this)... The best I can do is to send them on their last journey," one said.<br><br>"Stephen and Boon San (were) very close to us also. So we came here to pay our last respects," said another.<br><br>A minute of silence was observed before the Singapore Dragon Boat AssociationÂ’s president, RearÂ—Admiral (Retired) Kwek Siew Jin, handed the national flag, which was used to drape the coffin, to each of the families.<br><br>The families then moved into the service halls to have their own private ceremonies.<br><br>An independent panel of inquiry will be set up next week to investigate the tragedy.<br><br>The Singapore Sports Council, which will lead the multiÂ—agency team, said the panel will take a few months to deliberate and come out with its findings.
