            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Nikar<br><br>With all due respect, if you dunno the sport, you ain't fit to comment.<br><br>Whether it was an unanimous decision or not to wear life vest or row after race, let's not make lives miserable for those who are alive. I think they are more remorseful esp those who are close to the deceased.<br><br>If you are from Spore and you happen to remember this malay couple who rowed  at Seletar reservoir some months back, the guy had life vests on.  He could swim but he died.<br><br>We all make mistakes. We all learn from mistakes. Why did they row after the race cos if you happen to have race after race which left you with no time to rest and stretch, what you can only do is light rowing which allows your body to release the lactic acid building within you.<br><br>Its like running. You don't stop running after that. You walk or slow down to a jog.<br><br>Life vests don't come in sizes. Too bad for those who are too tall or too thin. It cuts into your flesh. Its worse than running abrasions. Yet its within that split second of 500m, 800m or 1km or more that matters so every paddler puts in all they have got cos the last thing you want is to walk away with regrets.<br><br>As for the race arrangement, no team has the final say. Say you're in men's team. After men's team, happen to be mixed boat A. You're in mixed boat A. You gotta be ready.<br><br>Dragonboaters are not cocky. Tho I admit some go there for vanity reasons, the reason why they chose to row back cos in local races and most of the overseas races even international races, after 6 boats raced, they take turn to row back. When you see that the 1st boat is done, then your boat row towards them.<br><br>Don't you ever make mistake? Do you know how tough the training is? Unless you have what it takes or is ready to go thru it, then you are fit to comment.<br><br>Let the dead rest in peace. Recently some teams have come up with black (I think) wristbands in memory of the dead dragonboaters. I don't know who are from Spore. While foreigners are making a mockery of the tragedy, I think it is time to support your local team after the setback and not mocked at your own people. Why are they training so hard? Why take the risk? To bring honor to their country. No doubt it was an expensive lesson, what's done cannot be undone.<br><br>Jo</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This will be a lesson taught to all dragon boaters. I cant say that this 5 young man SACRIFICE their life for us to be an example but rather its a mishap that no one expecting it. Hopefully, more precautions will be taken in action for future overseas competitions.<br><br>May all 5 guys RIP. Your departure has taught everyone a painful lesson and it will forever cast upon the Team Singapore Dragon Boat .<br><br>Condolences to the deceased families.<br><br>--Only the one above has seen it coming before anyone else.</div>

As I carried out studies on Chinese metaphysics, let me share with you that on 23 Nov 07, it was a very inauspicious day. For those that know 4 Pillars of Destiny or commonly called Bazi ( 8 characters), you can read on by clicking the doc link :<br>http://www.fengshuihub.page.tl/Case-Study-5_-Dragon-Boat-Tragedy.htm<br><br>Unfortunately, we are not God and cannot predict who will be the victim on this day.

            <div class='col-md body'>RIP to them all<br><br>In regards to the life-jacket issue, I found the article in todays ST in which their Dragonboat coach talked about the incident quite thought-provoking.<br>He reckons that if the whole team had worn life-jackets, then there would have been more casualties.<br><br>This is because he says that the only reason that some of the rowers stuck under the pontoon were able to escape is because they managed to sink/swim down to the deeper waters where underlying currents propelled them out and away from the pontoon. With lifejackets, it is likely that they would have been sucked under the pontoon, but trapped at the surface where they would surely suffocate.<br>I think his theory may indeed be correct, and while life jackets would definitely be helpful in instances such as if a rower fell out of the boat in the middle of the river, they might have indeed caused more casualties if the rowers had still been sucked under the pontoon.
