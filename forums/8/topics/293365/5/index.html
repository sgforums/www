Just that the safety message is put across bluntly. No matter how many times such accidents happened, people would soon forget. Lesson to learn for man here is: donÂ’t be boastful. Do not take safety lightly.<br>The Titanic was built by professionals, was declared unsinkable yet it sank.<br>Dragon boat paddlers are among the fittest and are strong swimmers too, yet there are some who drowned.<br>Even the giant aircraft carriers are tossed like matchboxes in stormy seas.<br>The 17 who survived are fortunate to have hung on to something, not because they are more fit. There are suitable life vests for such events, like the flat, inflatable life vests stowed under the aircraftÂ’s seats. It does not hamper a rowerÂ’s performance.<br>Against the force of nature, we are at itÂ’s mercy.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am just curious what bureacratic excuses will the Goverment agencies come up to justify and explain their side of the story. ONe thing for sure, they cannot blame the host country for neglience cz it will affect the Asean ties especially when the Asean Summit just ended. In the spirit of "Non-intervention in internal policies and politics" among Asean countries, SG may chOOse NOT to blame the Hosting country for slack safety rules.<br><br>I guess the surviving crew members should hold a press conference and speak up and dictate what went wrong. I expect their account to be honest and with honor.<br><br>They could probably address:<br><br>1) Their reason for not wearing the vest?<br>2) Whose decision was it to row the boats back?<br>3) What went wrong in their opinion.<br><br></div>
