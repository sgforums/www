              <p>I'm quite surprised that there are people still using CD players in Singapore, Year 2008, though you may be forgiven if you belong to one of the older generations.</p>
              <p>The number of songs that can be stored in a MP3* device depends on mainly these two factors:</p>
              <p>1. The quality of the music files (which is proportional to the filesize)<br>2. The storage capacity of the device</p>
              <p>*MP3, in general context, refers to a music data file; if you really want to know what does it mean, Google and Wikipedia is always there for you</p>
              <p>The short answer to your second question, I would say 100 near CD-quality MP3s per GB of storage available on the device.</p>
              <p>What sort of connection are you referring to? An internet connection?</p>
              <p>I'm not a iFan, so I'm not sure with the specifics of purchasing a tune from iTunes store and stuff like that, but if you don't have PayPal funds, you can always trade them with SGD via bank transfers with those funds sellers. I sell small amounts of PayPal funds occasionally too. Just be wary of scammers out there when doing so. Always demand to have them send the funds over first.</p>

              <p>I bought my first ipod last week also. Didn't really like apple before, but thought i'd give it a try since everyone around me has one.<br><br>It's an ipod nano 3G.. Was actually thinking for a couple of weeks already. luckily the 4G came out and the price of the 3G was cut by lots. The 8gb was the same price as the 4gb, so thought I'd just get it.<br><br>Now i've discovered the joys of watching videos on ipod. though the screen is very small, but its kinda cool. I rent DVDs and rip them, so my nano's basically a portable video player and i've another sony mp3 player for music. <br><br>Depends on what you're going for. I personally don't really like the shuffle coz there's no screen. I'd rather get another brand at the same price but with more features. Apple stuff are really marked up for the kinda quality you're getting. <br><br>If i were u, i'd get the classic, of if size was a concern, the nano..</p>
              <p>The ipod only syncs with itunes, basically like windows media player.. so as many have suggested, it might be a good idea to download the itunes and see if you like the interface. Some people don't.. Its free and you'd have to download it anyway if you're getting a shuffle or nano, there's no CD. There are also some issues going on with itunes 'spying' on your listening habbits and sending feedback to Steve also. hehs..<br><br> I don't think anyone uses itunes store in sg, with all the 'file sharing' going on around. <br><br>And yeah, you must have your own computer to sync, or your stuff will keep changing all the time. Unlike some mp3 players which are just 'drag and drop the file' kind, those you can plug into any com and just transfer files..<br><br>Or maybe you'd like to consider Creative instead? =X</p>

              <p>You cannot delete any song from the player itself.  You control your songs through ITunes.<br>what I will usually do is change the name of the song (under "info") and retype it in chinese.</p>

              u can choose to only sync a particular playlist in ur iTunes to your iPod.<br><br>
              
              yes, it is the ID tag. for Windows i dunno how you can use the correct codings (it is supposed to be Chinese in Unicode, not Chinese in Chinese GB 2312). Korean or whatever languages in Unicode works perfectly fine in iPod!

              <p>Hi, thanks LatecomerX.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Btw, I have my own comp lol..but it's a desktop PC..but with the USB cable that comes with the ipod is alright I guess.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>O btw, I might purchase a CD &amp; sync it with the ipod. Cause the download sites that I have don't have the songs I want.</p>
              <p> </p>
