              <p><span style="color: red;"><strong>Yes THE opposition is not very experienced but When
                       government changes hand, You will see many of the ex ruling members 
                      moving over to the new ruling. Some will be kicked out and some will 
                      stay or will be asked to stay in the new Government. </strong></span><br> <br> A new concept in Singapura is needed, It has been too one sided for far 
                      too long, ever since our grand-parents time. Its time for a change, And i
                       dont think Singapura will be reduced to a state of Famine. <br> <br> . Malaysians spending power is currently now more then Singaporeans.<br> .<br> Pay has been stagnant.<br> <br> . Public housing has increase, and buying a 2nd hand home is out of the 
                      question.(Foreigners are allowed to buy into Public Government Housing, A
                       foreigner together with his/her Siblings can purchase a HDB(W/o age 
                      restriction), while a Local Single can only purchase one at the age of 
                      35)<br> <br> . Medical Has Increased.<br> <br> . Education Has Increased.<br> <br> . Ministers Pay has increased.<br> <br> . Tax has Increased.<br> <br> . Population is getting too large.(I dont want to live in a dense 
                      society with no escape, You cant find a quite spot to make 
                      out(Psychologically Your mind is totally in over-drive 24/7, There is no
                       Silents, You dont get to stop everything around you and ponder about 
                      life)<br> <br> . 3 New E.R.P<br> <br> . The gap between the rich and poor has Increase dramatically, A new 
                      social class Divide.(Meaning not everyone will get to be who they want 
                      to be and top schools gives more priority to parents who have been 
                      educated there(Meaning a Doctor's son will be a Doctor and a plumber son
                       will be a plumber or maybe a plumber supervisor hehehe)<br> <br> . Our social fabric is being destroyed every single day.<br> <br> . Mrt and Buses are packed to the core (Now you have to let go off that 
                      train and wait for the next one cos its too damn packed to enter)<br> <br> . Democracy is a joke, No freedom of speech and death penalties is still
                       being carried out for Drug traffickers, When the Truth is that building
                       A casino has<br> brought in more vices and What happens when you lose all your money, You
                       will be a menace to your family and Society, We have to understand 
                      first what makes people consume drugs and as long as there is demand 
                      they will be supply, We can see even with the death penalty, There are 
                      still cases of people GETTING caught trafficking in large amounts of 
                      Drugs.. Etc like the Huge XTC bust a couple of weeks back)<br> <br> . Respect is not being Given to locals, But still being bad mouthed regularly.<br> <br> . With all the wealth being generated in this Country, The Welfare 
                      system is still a joke, To the point you can see people sleeping below 
                      void decks, old aunties and uncles picking up card-board and tin cans 
                      (Recently few friends from French came over to Singapore to meet up with
                       me, While having lunch one of them asked me why is there so many Senior
                       citizens still working?) So where does all our money go to? I rather it
                       be put to good use, Rather then wasting money putting up traffic lights
                       at places that dont need them etc... No one knows the amount of Reserve
                       we have, No transparency(Dont be surprised if there is nothing in 
                      there, and how much has our Investment Companies lost due to very bad 
                      judgments.  )<br> <br> . Ministers who are more interested in economic growth then social growth.<br> <br> . Media is being control(We are rank just in front of or behind 
                      Afghanistan by 1 point on freedom of Press, Meaning You dont really know
                       the Truth on what is going on in This country and World, YOUR MEDIA IS 
                      BEING CONTROLLED)<br> <br> . Controlling Religion Festivals for Minorities.<br> <br> . Running this country and deciding without 1st asking its citizens.<br> <br> Too be continued......<br> <br> G.E is coming so more Carrots for the Rabbits of 2011.</p>

              <p>Singapore is built on the basis of the law. Law IS TRUTH. But when ideas and concepts get too complicated, what IS truth? One small minority's truth and law becomes an entire society's inconvenience. And one whole society, is made up of tonnes of smaller and smaller minorities. What used to be easily differentiable dialect groups like Teochew and Hakka, and no longer applicable because the Teochews don't speak Teochew, the Hakkas don't eat Hakka food. And the Japanese and Korean food court stalls are operated by Chinese.</p>
              <p>Just yesterday I was at Seah Im Hawker Centre, and there was a Thailand imho Muslim stall selling Pad Thai and beef noodles, and the chief cook was a less than 30 year old Chinese girl with a foreign accent.</p>
              <p>And the food she cooked was shoot, solid Thai style that I tasted in Bangkok.</p>
              <p>That said, the future is one where boundaries are no longer applicable, but the problem is, are we as a solitude island nation, ready for such a noose?</p>
              <p>Humans can move and migrate, but can we move an island elsewhere? What used to be Singapore's strategic location, may one day become a City of Siege where the people outside are dying to get in, while the people inside are dying to get out.</p>
