            <div class='col-md body'>From my point of view, i'm overall not impressed with most of the drivers on the road and as a matter of fact i'm utterly incensed with the sickening driving manner of most singaporeans on the road. With such a systematic network of roads in singapore, it's bloody shameful that almost everyday, there are at least one case of traffic accidents on the road, be it a minor collision or a fatal collision. in the case of singapore roads, this should not been happening...bloody hell..this speaks well of our lousy skills on the roads and lack of courtesy and respect for other road users. big fat chicken f u c kers. I get bloody pissed up whenever i heard radio broadcast about traffic collisions in certain roads, not only do these f u c kers cause traffic jam and waste people time but they also waste the resource of Civil defence.<br><br>what pissed me up is the way singaporeans drive, amongst those few responsible drivers on the road whom i truly respect, there are apparently still a bunch of bloody retard impatient arrogant morons on the road who drive like monkeys, speed on the road, flout the traffic regulations, tailgate vehicles and change lanes abruptly without signalling etc, to me these irresponsible drivers are merely a whole bunch of damn pathetic sicko filthy lowly sore lazy useless brainless sickening sluggish arrogant smelly disgusting lousy snobbish cheap-skate eye-sore f u c ked-up terrible horrible evil despicable irritating big-time lame shameless pissed-off screwed-up good-for-nothing freaking bloody stupid ugly toad-faced clumsy retard, frankly speaking, i don't think they even deserve their driving licence and fit to drive on the roads, god damn it, puiz ..their granny smells like fried goat-ass double-boiled in a pig's c u n t*<br><br>the high number of traffic accidents on the road nowadays justifies how lousy and clumsy skills these brainless drivers possess, yet i don't understand why they choose to risk their god damn lives speeding on main roads and endanger the lives of other road-users, frankly speaking singapore drivers driving skills on the road merely sucks like f__u__c__k, or else we wouldn't be having so many traffic accidents despite the excellent directional aids and conditions on our roads, thanks to those troublemaker bane booger bastard ingrate loser jerk scumbag cow-dung gigolo faggot jinx dickhead c_u_n_t-faced sex-maniac bandit masturbator son-of-the-b_i_t_c_h speedsters who think their speeding skills are god damn good, but in fact they can come and suck my big fat penis, chicken f u c ker god damn it.<br><br>also i can't fathom out why do most bloody drivers like to act smart-alec and tailgate other vehicles, bloody hell kan ni na bu, it seems a difficult task for them to maintain a safe distance with the front vehicles, especially those god damn chicken mother f_u_c_ker pig cock scrotum dumbass taxi drivers who highly regards their so-called outstanding tailgating skills, in fact these morons who have the habit of tailgating can all come and kiss my big fat goofy smelly ass since they enjoy sniffing and kissing the ass of other vehicles, god damn it, na beh chee bye, but sorry i am not<br>referring to all the taxi-drivers in singapore, i am only<br>condemning a few bunch of impatient horny losers taxi-drivers<br>who drive as though they need to rush to the hospital to<br>watch their grandfather give birth. Kan ni na bu, simply<br>fed up of this lot of jokers son-of-the-b i tc h maggot sadist pervert pest peeping-tom transvestite eunuch lesbian rapist jailbird lackey wanking taxi-drivers who so enjoy tailgating. F U C K you<br>those who tailgate, damn bloody dangerous to tailgate espectially when you are carrying passengers, stupid faggot if u got guts, don't tailgate cars and<br>go tailgate those cement mixers and mobile cranes instead on<br>the roads instead, at least if u can't jam-break in time,<br>you will not implicate the driver on the vehicle in front.<br>If you still can't find that challenging and thrilling enough,<br>you can even trying kissing their ass and see what happens..<br>bloody hell..no wonder all the taxi companies still find it<br>hard to attain the safety benchmark set by land transport<br>authority, shame on you, thanks to those small bunch of bad<br>hats chicken mother f u c kers who overestimate their<br>tailgating skills.Cannot properly judge the safe<br>following distance?? i reckon<br>there must be something very f u c king wrong with their sense<br>of judgement and they should go to have your eye-sight<br>inspected, assholes. can't even drive in lanes, lousy driving<br>skills, not only that, beat red lights somemore and think<br>u can get away scot-free, may retribution befall on you jackass suck cock chicken mother F U C KERS. god damn it. na beh chow chee bye ok. Cannot drive properly, don't f u c king earn your trades on the roads and go geylang become a chicken ok or just stay at home and play with your son's penis..wake up your idea taxi drivers, f u c king hell, shame on you, keep failing the safety benchmark set by LTA, even singapore roads so systematic and so well-laid, also can langa. I am simply not impressed with those talkative taxi drivers who instead of concentrating on their driving, choose to talk non-stop to their passengers, i don't think we should advocate taxi drivers talking to their passengers, may the chickens fart into their mouths and may the chimpanzee shit into their mouths na beh chee bye kan ni nia bu<br><br>on the whole, the attitude of most drivers on the road still remains much to be desired, and to those who have the habitual tendency of speeding, i point to you my middle finger ok, god damn it..on the whole, some and in fact most of singapore drivers are poorly skilled at driving yet they are trying to flaunt their skills on the roads and think they can do away with the courtesy of signalling just because they are regular drivers on the roads, balls to you understand, god damn you, jolly well learn from countries like australia where all their drivers are much more courteous than you bunch of booger bastard ingrate loser jerk scumbag cow-dung gigolo faggot, in countries like australia, even those veteran experienced drivers still respect the traffic regulations by signalling and driving with proper habits and modest mindsets..<br><br>with such a systematic network of roads in singapore where road markings are all labelled clearly, the govenment has been trying to spoon-feed our drivers in their concerted effort to make our roads safer, yet i don't understand why are there still cases of collisions on the roads almost every day. bloody shameful pissed up, kan ni na ma aye chow chee bye..<br>To those drivers with good cautious driving habits who have maintained clean driving records and stayed accident-free for numerous years just like me, i salute and respect you as my role model<br>and idol. Courtesy begets courtesy and may you all be rewarded<br>for your good disciplined driving habits. The nation is proud<br>of you.<br>To those selfish arrogant impatient drivers with horrible driving habits who persist on speeding, reckless driving and tailgating and have consistently chalked out demerit points and involved in traffic collisions, you sore bunch of lousy and poor skilled chee bye kuku bird lan jiao maniacs deserve your retribution, na beh chee bye, i point my middle finger at you bunch of shameful maniacs ok, chee bye, f_u_c_k off and retribution awaits you morons for your selfish acts on the roads ok, even if retribution does not befall on you, your next generation will pay for your sins, it's just a matter of time, god damn it chee bye....those reckless impatient drivers should go f u c k spiders really ok chee bye..loser, bunch of monkey penis sucker manure-sniffer chimpanzee buttock licker cockroach eater orangutan sperm drinker saddam husseinÂ’s slave osama bin ladenÂ’s servant, i'm bloody sure my great grandma can drive better than you. i suggest u bunch of wayward drivers Wake up your idea or else you can go to the kranji turf club and<br>F U C K the cows ok, chee bye, don't endanger the lives of other road-users ok of course i'm not refering to all the drivers in singapore but only to those impatient ill-discilpined act-smart drivers who deserved to be F U CKed up the rooftop. kam my lan jiao ok.<br><br>it's with regret but abhorrence that i have to post this thread, stemming from the criticism on the lack of safety awareness among singapore drivers on the roads nowadays.but again may i make this clear that i'm not condemning all singapore drivers and i'm bloody aware that this thread will incur the wrath of most people on the road but to those responsible disciplined drivers with good driving records and a clear conscience you may find this thread totally rubbish and irrelevant to you and you folks don't even have to bother about my uncivilised and ill manner languages, and for that matters may i hereby apologize for being uncouth in my criticism and also my f u c kup up english, you folks may label me as ill-bred and lunatic sicko bastard whatever but i don't really care because hurling offensive and abusive remarks is very trivial compared to irresponsible and inconsiderate driving manners on the road and if our manners on the roads are so much ugly and disgusting and disrespectful and fail to portray a civilised image on us, portraying a civilised image in this forum will even make us more hyprocrite, what's the f u c king point??? wake up your idea mann.. oh my goodness what will happen to me after posting this thread, i don't really give a damn, you forum moderators can ban me, track my ip and even issue a warrant of arrest on me, take me to court whatever but let me tell you I DON'T REALLY GIVE A DAMN, nanny nanny poo poo..nanny nanny poo poo....nanny nanny poo pooOoOoOoOoOoOoOo....<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For those who knew the way it will be better to guide the taxi driver as he may not be familiar or just plain dishonest. Especially when the taxi is approaching the area which you are familiar guide him so he will follow. I do that when I cannot claim from my company else heck care lah can claim let the taxi driver earn a bit more lor. Best is can get taxi driver write the receipt on paper so can cheat but if use automated one hard to cheat. Cheat must have tolerance level cuz company HR also quite smart to estimate the distance travelled and pricing... agar agar tio ho <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Not so irritating.<br><br>But.....once....the worst driver of all......in my entire life......<br><br>This man kept talking about women, sexually.<br>In fact, at a traffic stop, some pedestrians were crossing the road, and this man made comments about a woman's assets who was walking. Very rude, with hand gestures too.<br><br>I was quiet all the time, dunno why he kept having fun with all that. The entire journey. The worst taxi driver I have ever met in my life.</div>
