              haha.. This is what I call a sensible post. I know what you mean.. I am just trying to help my fellow "countryman" who seems ignorant and lost about his country's dignity :) I don't like it when someone says anything unfair or wrong about my country.. I will defend it automatically provided that its the truth.

              <p>*sigh*... where do I even start? too many people hate us.
              literally, <strong><em>everyone</em></strong> hates us.</p>
              <p>Everyone thinks that Indian men are manwhores that date any race
              of women other than their own.</p>
              <p>I mean you chinese and other east asians can fit in easily with
              white folks because white men love chinese women.</p>
              <p>We ain't got that shit. We have nothing to offer them to fit in.
              We take everything from them. Their jobs and their women.</p>
              <p>And even other south asians like pakistanis hate us because they
              think hindus are inferior.</p>
              <p>Singhalese hate Tamils. Tamil people have been living in
              Northern Sri Lanka for ages and theyre being driven out from their
              own homeland. And singhalese <em>are</em> essentially hybrids of
              native srilankans(australoid) and south indians. A fact that they
              and us don't like to admit.</p>
              <p>And north indians think that they're superior than south
              indians. Because of their so called "aryan" origin. (fact: theyre
              nothing but mogrelization of south indians by
              iranians/scythians/and tiny bit of caucasian)</p>
              <p>American East Asians think that Indians are rightfully not
              "asian" because we don't have slitty eyes or oriental features.</p>
              <p>Eurocentrists insist that the indus civilliations of mohenjo
              daro and harappa were built by caucasians. And that the vedic
              scriptures and sanskrit are not dravidian(south indian) but
              Indo-European.</p>
              <p>Afrocentrists insist that south indians are racially related to
              them. But they still hate us anyways.</p>
              <p>Now who else wants a piece of the ancient indus? Because we're
              too damn degenerate to create a highly urbanized civillisation at
              time when the rest of the world was beating each other up with
              clubs and living in caves.</p>
              <p>No one likes our culture. No one likes our language. And a
              research showed that tamil wont live to the next millenium...</p>
              <p>And that bastard christopher columbus named native americans
              "indians". So now you have to elaborate to people "what indian are
              referring to? the ones that go hey-hey-ha-ha or the the ones that
              wear dots on their foreheads and eat curry?"</p>
              <p>And BBC reported a survey than Indian men have small penis?
              <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"> Great... so now we are hairy, ugly, dark
              AND have a small penis? Screw that...</p>
              <p>And Indian men were sent to South Africa during British
              Occupation as slaves! As fucking slaves! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="icon_cry.gif"></p>
              <p>Well if theres a god then he's a a real cruel bastard. Because
              of all the races of human beings to be, being an indian is a
              punishment.</p>

              <p>Even though Im a chinese, Im not biased or racist towards indian. Do you know that many indian people are really smart in terms of their studies? I got 1 indian classmate who's really smart. Me and him are very competitive in terms of studies and grades.</p>

              <p>And just ignore those racists, cause they are jealous of who you are. In fact i honestly think majority of the people don't judge people by skin colour.</p>
