              <p>*sigh*... where do I even start? too many people hate us. literally, <strong><em>everyone</em></strong> hates us.</p>
              <p>Everyone thinks that Indian men are manwhores that date any race of women other than their own.</p>
              <p>I mean you chinese and other east asians can fit in easily with white folks because white men love chinese women.</p>
              <p>We ain't got that shit. We have nothing to offer them to fit in. We take everything from them. Their jobs and their women.</p>
              <p>And even other south asians like pakistanis hate us because they think hindus are inferior.</p>
              <p>Singhalese hate Tamils. Tamil people have been living in Northern Sri Lanka for ages and theyre being driven out from their own homeland. And singhalese <em>are</em> essentially hybrids of native srilankans(australoid) and south indians. A fact that they and us don't like to admit.</p>
              <p>And north indians think that they're superior than south indians. Because of their so called "aryan" origin. (fact: theyre nothing but mogrelization of south indians by iranians/scythians/and tiny bit of caucasian)</p>
              <p>American East Asians think that Indians are rightfully not "asian" because we don't have slitty eyes or oriental features.</p>
              <p>Eurocentrists insist that the indus civilliations of mohenjo daro and harappa were built by caucasians. And that the vedic scriptures and sanskrit are not dravidian(south indian) but Indo-European.</p>
              <p>Afrocentrists insist that south indians are racially related to them. But they still hate us anyways.</p>
              <p>Now who else wants a piece of the ancient indus? Because we're too damn degenerate to create a highly urbanized civillisation at time when the rest of the world was beating each other up with clubs and living in caves.</p>
              <p>No one likes our culture. No one likes our language. And a research showed that tamil wont live to the next millenium...</p>
              <p>And that bastard christopher columbus named native americans "indians". So now you have to elaborate to people "what indian are referring to? the ones that go hey-hey-ha-ha or the the ones that wear dots on their foreheads and eat curry?"</p>
              <p>And BBC reported a survey than Indian men have small penis? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"> Great... so now we are hairy, ugly, dark AND have a small penis? Screw that...</p>
              <p>And Indian men were sent to South Africa during British Occupation as slaves! As fucking slaves! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="icon_cry.gif"></p>
              <p>Well if theres a god then he's a a real cruel bastard. Because of all the races of human beings to be, being an indian is a punishment.</p>

              <p><br> Discrimination? What is so absurd to compare one human being against another human being? Oh hang on, you are not human are you? Yes you are not. You are just an animal. Who can't use her brain to realise that all are humans and proceeds to imply that she is superior then Bangla or PRC.</p>
              <p>Nice. Another racist faggot spotted on sgForums. Gawd. Do we have an endless supply over here or what?</p>
              <p>And TS, you should really stop calling yourself an Indian. Because all you are is just one big fat DISGRACE to our nation. You know nothing about Indians apparently. All you can do is search specific sites about racism against Indians and declare that "Aww, mommy I'm so sad, sob sob, people are racist against us, sob sob.. bwaaaa.."</p>
              <p>SHEESH!!! Grow up kid. I am an Indian and I won't change that fact for no reason. I feel patriotism running in my blood although I have lived half my life in India and half over here. For me, there is only one country that I call home. That is India.
                  
                  Losers who think like you are welcome to declare themselves as being from other countries.</p>

This is because it is the most precise, and therefore suitable language for computer software. ( a report in Forbes magazine, July 1987 ).</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Chess was invented in India.</span></strong></p>

              <p>Eh bro.. I don't even need to go to other race's houses. When they cook pork (or whatever  it is), the smell spreads everywhere and its horrible and vomit inducing. Even ang mohs find it horrible and they don't understand how something which smells so bad can be eaten..</p>
              <p>What you smell might be incense sticks. What is good smell to you might be crap for us and vice-versa. Doesn't mean you bash around ya? :)</p>
              <p>And I noticed that most of the other race's house are very messy. Yeah, I am stereotyping so that you will see my point.</p>
