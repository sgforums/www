            <div class='col-md body'>Starved, you aren't the only one who comes from a broken home.  Believe me, I grew up in abject poverty and I know what it's like. Even then, there's no reason to use vulgarities on your mother, it certainly won't help matters.  Be grateful about what you have rather than complain about the quality of the food, household chores, etc, which seem trivial when you compare yourself to orphans or children who have to work to support their families.<br>By the way, I have a car and I'll do what you asked for free! *just kidding*</div>
