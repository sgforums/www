            <div class='col-md body'>I know it's one day after Mother's Day and all that but I REALLY HATE MY MOTHER.<br><br>She can't cook for nuts. None of us in the family- my father, three siblings and me- like her food. It was so bad that even my dog refused to eat her stuff after a while. The best part is, she's been a housewife for THIRTY FUCKING YEARS.<br><br>This is not that pisses me off. What pisses me off is that she refuse to make an effort. I tell her not to cook fish (she just fries it and serves it without any sauce whatsoever, so that it has that awful stinky fishy smell) because I don't eat it for instance. But she always cooks that dish and calls that plus a plate of oily vegetables DINNER. I tell her- as I have one million times already- that I don't eat fish and veg just isn't filling.  She insists that other people eat it even if I don't. But there's only my brother and he almost never comes home for dinner (he can afford to because he has $$$ to eat out), so that disgusting dish is recycled for at least three more meals. WHAT IS SO FUCKING DIFFICULT TO REMEMBER THAT I DON'T EAT FISH!!!<br><br>That STUPID BITCH just fries things, so meals are always tasteless. My siblings and I are underweight and suffered from malnutrition when we were kids, all thanks to her. We bought her so many cookbooks but she never looks at them. SHE DOESN'T DO ANY BLOODY THING THE WHOLE DAY EXCEPT WATCH TV!!!! IT"S NOT LIKE SHE DOESN'T FUCKING HAVE THE TIME! THAT STUPID BITCH DON"T CARE ABOUT US. WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH HER?<br><br>My dad is always overseas because of his job. Ironically, our house is neater when he's back. Why? Because he bothers to clear up the mess, not like THAT BITCH WHO DOES NOTHING BUT WATCH TV ALL DAY. For goodness sake, she doesn't even throw away towels that have grown mould on them, and insists that they can still be used. She can't even bear to spend a few dollars on A TOWEL but fritters away $10 on a stupid Reader's Diegest.<br><br>I HATE THAT BITCH!!! SHE IS NOT MY MOTHER!!!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Starved..why don't you cook for the family instead? Maybe..you can see how troublesome it was to prepared the fish and vegetable before cooking them and serving them out for the rest to eat. Lastly..who did the cleaning and washing up?...not your mother again...I supposed?<br><br>There is nothing wrong in spending money for a good book such as Reader Digest. It can be read by other person(s) in the family too. To think that she had the fulfilled her part of the responsibilties to bring up the family for the last thirty years...what was a little oversight on her part? Correct me if I'm wrong...but I think you are too demanding. And please...don't use vulgar language to say bad things about your mum. She is still your mum.</div>

But can't resist flaming you to cool down my "angry fire".  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> I really feel sorry for your mother, why didn't she gave birth to a " cha ciao" instead of you this piece of shit. *sigh*<br><br>Sometimes, we may blame our parents don't understand us well, put too much expectations on us and ect. But we never have right to blame our dearest mum for her cooking and her laziness. I feel damn disgusted for you calling your mum BITCH because of her poor cooking. Starved, u are even worse than an animal. Your mum gave birth to u and served u for so many years, how can u call your mum bitch??  I strongly feel that u treat your mum as maid, grow up man, even to maids, you still can have that bad attitude.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Starved, I pity the situation that you're in. Although I don't really know how it's like, but I think I sympathise you.<br><br>I suggest you try discuss with your siblings, see how they feel and whether they willing to help you solve the problem. Next, you talk to your mum by yourself, no one else, coz' people gets defensive when too many people are around. If this fails, talk to your dad.<br><br>If he won't listen, summon the family for a gathering at a suitable time...not when ur dad has meeting to attend, ur mum wants to catch the tv, I'm sure you can arrange this -&gt; get help from siblings. Sometimes, the problem is that we don't talk about things and simply pretend that nothing happens. I know that the older generations are less receptive of what the young have to say, but at least you give it a try.<br><br>Finally, if all these fail, then I think look for counsellor. Don't be afraid of seeking help, because if you really care for your family, then you will not mind feeling a little awkward.<br><br>Wish you happiness.<br><br>[This message has been edited by lonewolfe (edited 16 May 2000).]</div>

He's probably better off dead or as a pest. It's easy to put the blame on others, but difficult to discover the real reason behind things. Probably starved is the one creating all the problems at home.<br><br>To starved: SHUT THE FUCK UP AND EAT WHAT IS SERVED AND TREASURE YOUR PARENTS!!!!!

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm...... I don't even think I wanna quote you Starved, and it definitely won't be my intention to flame you or anything, but I guess your mum does deserve much much more respect than you are giving now, for the very very simple reason that she is your mum.<br><br>The next thing I would like to mention is that no doubt that it doesn't seem very amicable at the moment within your family, but still, every families have their problems. Don't treat your family as the worst scenario case here. Lots of people are far worse off than you, but are not complaining about it here.<br><br>Final point. Your mum doesn't cook well, she watches TV all the time, have you ever considered why? Have you tried to understand what is going on within her? What is she actually thinking? For a woman whose husband is away most of the time, whose children are old such that they have a world of their own, to endure that loneliness, what do you think about it? And to top that all up, children who complain about her every move. Take it as her silent protest I guess, for I'm sure she have heard enough such that she has gotten immuned to it all.<br><br>This situation extends more than just bad food. It seems to be like a cold war is in place between your mum and you guys, her children, and maybe between your mum and your dad. What is required to improve the situation. More interaction between all parties. There is definitely a reason why your mum is doing what she is doing. What you could do, maybe sit down and watch TV with her, and talk to her in the meantime. I think if more love and concern is injected within this family cell, lots of things will be improved. Talk to your mum. I'm sure there are loads of things you can talk to your mum about. You spend all your time with your friends (somehow I don't think that is an assumption), so why not spare a little time with your family as well? I am sure it deserves a little more attention from you too. Not only from you, but the whole family. It might seem a little strange in the beginning, but give it time, I'm sure things will better.<br><br>Remember, what you see now of your mum are the tasteless fish and the lifeless TV box. Your mum is not going to be around forever. Don't wait until it is too late before starting to regret about your present actions, stare at those childhood pictures and realise that your mum did indeed care for you all and something did indeed go wrong along the way. Act now, give everyone a chance. If not for anyone, you deserve that chance.<br><br>"Don't fight with the sea, dance with it......"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay, Starved, u can call your mum what you want. But like Atti's remind to u, beware of the thunder in the raining days.<br><br>Maybe your mum is really bad in cooking, not a good mother to take care of you. But no matter how bad she is, she did not let you die in starve after all. She is your mother, not a chef for you. Our mothers cook for us, it is thankful enough, why so much complaints? We can give her suggestions and comments to her cooking. But remember, it is not her duty to cook for you, especially when you grow up even i know you only grow up physically not mentally.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>What do u want to get from your mother is delicious food only? Is your life only for eating? To me, eat only for life, life not for eat, can u distinguish it?<br>I think you can be a happy person easily, give you a delicious meal, u already can get satisfied. What difference to an animal? Even animals still know treasure their mothers, you????  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>YES, I WISH I'VE NEVER BEEN BORN! i WISH SHE ABORTED ME! WHAT'S THE POINT OF HAVING CHILDREN IF U DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT THEM! SOMEBODY ONCE SAID AN ABSENT FATHER IS WORSE THAN A DEAD ONE, YOU ARE REDUCED TO BEGGING FOR LOVE! WELL, IT APPLIES TO BOTH MY PARENTS. GIVING BIRTH TO A CHILD DOESN'T FUCKING MADE YOU A MOTHER! QUICK, IF THERE'S ANY LIGHTNING, STRIKE ME DOWN NOW. ANYBODY WITH A CAR? HECK, I'LL PAY YOU TO RUN ME DOWN! I DON'T CARE WHETHER I LIVE OR NOT!!!<br><br>HOW DO YOU STUPID IDIOTS KNOW I DON'T DO HOUSEWORK? HOW DO YOU KNOW I HAVEN'T TRIED COOKING MYSELF? EVERYTIME I TRY, SHE HAS TO INTERFERE, ORDERING ME AROUND, AS IF SHE'S THE GODDAMN BEST COOK AROUND. IN THE END, THE FOOD IS RUINED THANKS TO HER. AND SHE USES EMOTIONAL BLACKMAIL TO MAKE ME EAT HER STUFF. ALL THE STUPID CRAP OF LOOKING REALLY HURT WHEN I DON'T EAT HER FOOD. AS IF! IF SHE REALLY 'CARED', SHE WOULD REMEMBER NOT TO COOK FOOD THAT I TOLD HER ONE MILLION TIMES NOT TO COOK! GEEZ!!!! AND SHE WOULD BLOODY EAT HER OWN FOOD, BUT SHE DOESN'T, BUSY GORGING HERSELF WITH JUNK FOOD. I TRIED BUYING JUNK FOOD FOR MYSELF BUT THAT STUPID BITCH ALWAYS EATS THEM UP HERSELF! AAAAARRRRGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>IT'S NOT AS IF I CAN BORROW ANY MONEY FROM ANYONE. MY FATHER IS ALWAYS OVERSEAS, REMEMBER? AND MY BROTHER IS GLAD- LUCKY- TO ESCAPE.  ALL THE OTHERS HAVE 'ESCAPED' ALREADY, AFTER GETTING MARRIED. I'M THE ONLY BLOODY ONE LEFT!!! FORGET ABOUT LENDING MONEY FROM THEM! THEY CONSIDER ME A NUISANCE!!! IF I DIE NOW, I DON'T THINK ANYONE WILL GRIEVE FOR ME!<br><br>THOSE WHO TALK SO MUCH SHOULD VOLUNTEER THEMSELVES. STAY AT MY HOUSE FOR ONE MONTH, EAT MY MOTHER'S COOKING, BATHE WITH TOWELS THAT HAS MOULD GROWING OUT OF THEM, PUT UP WITH CONSTANT EMOTIONAL BLACKMAIL. THAT'S THE BEST KIND OF PUNISHMENT YOU CAN GET!!!!!!<br><br></div>
