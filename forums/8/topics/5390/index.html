            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm, I must say that the jap look and the Sing look is very different.  Each has it's own quality to it, but most people do have a jap fetish...common just take a look at how many jap porn sites are around and u should see why...compare that with this 1 site for Singaporean girls...and it's wildly popular...imagine 20,000 sites like SG Girls but with nude Singaporean women doing really vulgar things in them(yes!!!)...:-)  I'm willing to bet my right testicle that ther will be a horde of people here and elswehere with a Sing fetish.<br><br>Japanese look has a quality that bends more towards looking cute more than anything else...and not forgetting flahing white cotton panties...yummm!:-)  Which idiot wouldn't get turned on?<br><br>On the other hand, the Singaporean quality is more ephemeral...it's more delicate than the jap look, which is quite outright daring...<br><br>(It's still a mystery to me(even after all the jap sites i've been to), how they can make such an ordinary school uniform look so hot and slutty and cute!  all at the same time.)<br><br>The Singgirls look is more towards looking pretty.  looking clean and pristine and they aren't ouright open about flashing guys...Singgirls make guys wonder...they make guys imagine....<br><br>The jap look is just in your face so it's very easy to just settle for that because u don't have to do the work of imagining her naked or in a sensual pose...Man, u see them half naked already.<br><br>So that is basically the main difference between the two looks....<br><br>Why people prefer jap is because of the fetish and also because it is something exotic because it originates from a country far away...local girls are ...local.  They'll still be here while the Jap girls are rareer here...<br><br>My preference?  Both.  Depending on how I feel.  Now the only problem is how to even get 1.  ?Don't know leh. stumped.  Both also cannot get.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think jap girls appeal in their own way cos their image is like  nubile sexually oppressed and  willing (well ok horny, happy?) veiled behind a youthful,innocent and  ignorant facarde.<br><br>I realized when i was in japan that there seems to be a fetish on school girl uniforms. Ok this u already know.  But i was just thinking that with all this paid dating between working men and high school girls (for extra pocket money), jap men are having a fetish on their own daughters......<br><br>Anyway the japanese culture is a male dominated one....witness how much bondage and rape feature in the porn sites...<br><br>Lastly, if u take a walk along Shinjuku and anywhere fashionably near , u will see that (or at least dats what i saw) there are really many pretty high school girls walking by you.<br><br>I heard from a fren that the school girls fold up the waist of their skirt so that they get a shorter skirt so even in summer they wear cardigns to cover the waist area.<br><br>I've seen some local girls try the loose socks mary jane shoes thing but dun think it works coz well frankly, the skirt is not short enuf....and the image isnt the same.<br><br>Anyway our weather is too humid to wear a smart looking sweater matched with a very short skirt.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would think that its due to the fascination with Jappo culture coz its juz way so diff from ours. Japan is seen as a 'hip' and 'happening', so its not strange that some local girls are emulating their style. Besides, Japan is an Asian country like Sing, so perhaps the style is more easily accepted and suited to us rather then that of a western country.<br><br>But of course Japan is also quite interesting... I heard they even have vending machines that sell used girl school uniforms and lingerie. Where the hell are we gonna find those in Sing???  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Why? Why me?<br><br></div>

Dun believe what you see on TV all the time, but then , the uniforms they wear makes them look real chic and oh!! All those clothes too, they really know how to dress!<br>The make up too is fabby.

            <div class='col-md body'>I went to visit my ex in Saitama, about 40-50km away from Tokyo only so I hung around Tokyo lots too! Was quite disappointed the first few times I went so I didn't really expect much this June. Alot are really plain but their uniform makes them look raelly smart,dun you think?<br>Also, I have to admit, they dress better...ya...and the hairstyles too!!!(er, maybe they do go to salons!!) I may not be a Jap, but I do know that in Japan, image is very important, I have been with my ex's frens who I know will rather not eat so they can go to fashionable boutiques to buy clothes and makeup.<br>But then ah, like I mentioned, I started to miss the Sing gals and our Orchard Road.<br>For all you people who have been travelling ard the world, I am sure you must agree wif me that after all that travelling, coming back to babewatching at Orchard is still the best.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I've been to Japan quite a few times already. There really is a lot of pretty girls walking the streets. I believe that the girls there are at the extremes(they're either pretty or ugly). (No Offence).<br><br>Til now, I haven't seen an average looking girl. If I did, she probably wasn't Japanese. I guess the reason why is because they really do know how to put on makeup and look pretty.<br><br>About the Japanese school in SG. There are a few cute ones if you watched closely. But then again, you can't expect much from a Japanese population of only about 30,000 compared to the 3.3 million people here.<br><br>Cheers.</div>
