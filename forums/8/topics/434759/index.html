              <p>Of cuz, the insurgent in iraq and taliban in afganistan r using guerilla warfare. They r not stupid, because they cannot stand the might of usa forces. They use IED to ambush the american convoys. Very effective because it demoralises the americans. How would you feel if you see your buddy in NS torn to shreds by IED? And then it slow down the supply convoy to supply the bases. Very effective because for every IED, the taliban can kill 5 americans with no loss of taliban combatants. They can plant their IED anywhere and anytime, it is almost impossible to detect them. Also, america has to rely on mobile thin armored humvees to transportation because they cannot transport tanks by air into landlocked afganistan. So IED could easily penetrate the armor of humvees. Moreover, afganistan terrain is very rugged and mountainous not practical to bring tanks in.</p>
              <p>The taliban also resort to assasinations of local afgan government leaders to weaken the government. And they infiltrate into the afgan national army and then later relay confidential potential military operations to their taliban counterparts. Sometimes these spies who enter the afgan army will engage in suicide missions while doing patrols with NATO troops to kill as many as possible.</p>

People who said Vietnam won the war, I mean, some of the babies were born with defects after the war, these damage last generations... I know about US debt levels but I can talk about that all day and it'll be out of topic so I won't... but country debts are different from individual debts, remember country can print money to pay off debts, individuals can't, but printing money to pay debts have other sets of problems, but i won't dwell into that to avoid going out of topic.</p></div>
