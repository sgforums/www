NUS one is the only one that would be more or less seen as the "true" law degree in singapore. but then again from a lawyer's point of view, define "true"... hahaha... ok ok. i don't intend to be part of a law society anyway, so this degree wld still be considered a qualification even in other proffessions.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>don't forget, although not recognised by the so-called law society, it is still recognised in the civil service, in other words, part of Commonwealth Universities, approved by the Public Service Division, which is to me the only thing that matters, since i'd rather work for the government in the civil service than be a lawyer, and this qualification is relevant.. (like i said, i've checked it 3 times, i can't be wrong that this one's recognised, so i'm going for it.)<br><br>BUT... "real deal NUS lawyers" may see this one as a fag qualifaction, a poppy paper, a wannabe cert, given to incompetent legal students with incompetent legal skills...  i mean, the external UoL degree does not prepare graduates "enough"... no moot court room, no debate clubs... so if you truly wanna be a lawyer, work for it @ NUS... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>for me, this one's enough. i don't need iron-law-qualification from NUS to have had recieve some knowledge that is valuable and relevant in future.. it's good to understand in-depth of the law, even in business or in police work. no one likes lawyers that much anyway.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
