            <div class='col-md body'>i'm not that good a write but i try to write some short stories now and then. dont laugh at my story pls. here it is:<br><br>Twist<br><br>It was just like an ordinary day with the sun out blazing and scorching the back of the necks of tedious workers like me. I remember it clearly. I was tugging my briefcase with the documents inside when I first passed her on that busy street. If IÂ’m not wrong it was Fegen Street. The light brown hair, the soft black eyes which could get you lost in them staring straight into space in the clear marbles of her face.<br><br>My heart skipped a beat, my eyes immediately took her image in and sent it to my brain which processed it and matched it with words like cute and pretty. IÂ’m a lawyer if I havenÂ’t mentioned it and I pride myself on judgement of character, she was perfect. My hand was raised slowly to form a hello sign, halfway through I pictured how stupid I would look on that street with my hands up waving at a person I never knew.<br><br>I knew she was made for me, my mind told me so. It just seemed so right for us to be together. I could feel the soft sand on Soon beach sifting through our feet and smiles on our faces under a cool shady palm. It was all too perfect.<br><br>Nevermind I knew I had responsibilities to fulfil like feeding my parents and giving us a good home. When I saw her I never had a doubt in my mind she wouldnÂ’t be mine. I couldnÂ’t care less, she was just so angelic, words cannot describe her. She was more than a picture, even if it can paint a thousand words it just could not paint her.<br><br>Everyday I passed her my heart grew fonder and I grew more impatient to be with her and one fine day I pulled up my socks and went up for her. She was worth my effort. She soon grew to love me and me to her vice versa. It was like she was my missing best friend in school, my motivator. When I come home from work tired she would accompany me and she gave me a reason to be off work. I adored her. She was growing prettier and prettier everyday. They say absence makes the heart grow fonder, even though I was always not far from her I liked her more and more.<br><br>We went practically everywhere together. She was everything I hoped she would be, if not better. We went to the beach very often, she loved the ocean. We would swim and bask and have fun times. I always gave her my warmth in return for her love and loyalty. Everything I ever dreamed of was in her, this small being in this small earth. She was my life.<br><br>Day by day passed and I became a successful man with a high paying job and a big house. My parents were now rich and happy. I did not have a worry in the world. She was getting older and older like everyone does how I wish time would slow down.<br><br>She died when I was 45 just when I had just retired, my heart still aches for her. I will remember you forever my dear pet dog.<br></div>
