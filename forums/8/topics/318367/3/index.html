              <p>To: Angel7030 and qIqq9</p>
              <p>Well ladies, what u all have just said make complete sense to me (being a guy though). However, I should say there are some rare gem out there which is really hard to find. As a song goes:"ten men, 7 are stupid, 8 are ..., 9 are bad and 1 is out there for grab"</p>
              <p>As i had said earlier, men can hardly control their lust and this coincides with what Angel had mentioned.</p>
              <p>Before i finished, I will like to say something about generalisation.</p>
              <p>I think the perception which u all developed can be primarily attributed to the bad experience u gals have with men. Like I have said, it is "perception". Now putting yourself into my shoes, won't multiple rejection from girls makes me feel demotivated in seeking soulmate?</p>
              <p>Therefore, i shall end my word with:"should this perception hinders me from seeking my happiness? Always remember sweet come after bitterness."</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br>The ideal scenario in love is to make sure your soulmate loves you more than you love him/her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And dear uncertain,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As you righly put it, "sweet come after bitterness" but in Love, sweet can become bitterness again. You can study and work hard/smart to get what you want, you can earns lots of hard earned money to purchase what you dream of, you can pursue your golden years in life, all these came from bitterness, endurance, loss of youth, sacrification etc etc to attain your desire goal. As you sow, it shall bear.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But love is different, at time, even if you sow and attend to it nicely, it may not bear any fruit and worst, at time it can be fatal.</p>

              <p>so far we are just getting ROM and we have already spent:</p>
              <p>ROM venue: 300 (you don't need to pay this if you are doing it in the ROM office, but I would advise you to apply for a date as early as 3 months before your ROM date, otherwise you won't be able to get a place)</p>
              <p>ROM dinner (one table for close relatives and frens): 400</p>
              <p>ROM dress for me: 400</p>
              <p>Accessories, make up, shoes, flowers: 300</p>
              <p>Wedding band (1 pair): 1100</p>
              <p>Proposal ring: 1100</p>
              <p>Photographer: we getting a friend to help us take, but if you want a professional photographer, be prepared to spend around 200 - 300 for a day...</p>
              <p>so altogether for ROM, already spend nearly 4k...</p>
              <p>for banquet, most restaurants need you to have a minimum of 15 tables and above, and one table usually cost around 500 and above...so be prepared to spend around 10k to 15k to the dinner and also the photography plus bridal gowns...</p>

              all depends how much you, your potential ball and chain and the families are willing to spend and stomach.
              
              Could be as cheap as just go ROM register and the other half move intothe room. end of story in which case will be very cheap( i forgot the money we get extorted of to comply witht eh govt. regulation of registering marriages but i think less than hundred)

              <p>believe me, the wedding itself is the least of your worries...if you've not decided to apply for a flat, it's ok...but if you do, there are more to worry about...renovations, shopping for electricals and electronics stuffs, funitures and such...these costs more than the wedding...plus, you most probably can recover some money from the dinner, and probably even make some profit if you chose not to hold it at hotels...unless you have many many rich friends and relatives...</p>
              <p>when my wife and i ROMed in 2004, we just got our keys and were renovating the flat at the same time...so, our reception was held at Dragon Gate...dim sum buffet for about 40 plus relatives and friends...less than $1k...our wedding bands costs less than $1k too, with my wife opting for one without diamonds...we had to do that as our savings were all thrown into the new flat cos we did not take any loans...after moving in to the new flat, our savings dwindled from 5 digits to 3 digits...it took us another 2 years to save up for the wedding...i was lucky my wife was understanding...my first diamond ring for her was a cheapo $199 one...and she never complained as we were both eager to set up our home...but now that we are financially stable, she has kept the $199 ring and now has 2 bigger ones on each hand...</p>
              <p>my advice to you if you do not come from a rich family is, start with the basics first...and along the way, you get her better and better things...imagine if you gave her a ring that costs $5k now...it'll be tough to top that every year...</p>
