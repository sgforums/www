              <p><br>Oh maybe, but i can said that men are born unfaithful, it is the discipline that tight them down to faithfulness. How long can that discipline last, i dunno, i agreed that many young guys or middle age ones are faithful to their wife but in later age, even at 60yo, you can see the unfaithfulness bearing out of the cave.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, i am surrounded by unfaithful men, men as teacher, police, managers, CEOs, bosses, ah bengs, ah sengs, ah nehs, ah mats etc etc in all walks of life, beneath them lies their faithful wife waiting for them to come home. And one of the basic skill in men is that they know how to clean well before entering their family.</p>

              <p>I do agree with u to some extent (being a guy myself).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just look at Sun Zi Bing Fa, there is Beauty Plot.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Look at chinese proverb,  there is "hero can hardly control his lust"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, this only applies to some men, not all. Minority if i should say. **Seriously, how many men can tahan a Lin Chiling alike babe?**</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Good man are hard to come by, just like good woman. It is the inner beauty that attracts them and not outer. Angel, if u want a good hubby or faithful bf, change your inner self. And not ur bust and whatsoever.</p>

              <p><br>Couple with a liberal sex society here, men can easily betray their wifes and family. how then can I, be faithful to my man.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Every move he makes, take a clue of suspicious in my mind. Therefore, i rather choose to be single, hang around with them and let their wifes explore for themselve if they are still remain in a naive state as i heard an aunt of mine saying, "my husband is very faithful to me, he is so innocent" wow! the other day, as i drove past,  i saw him with a sexy low cut gal at Geyland Road. </p>

              <p>actually, it all boils down to your budget...service standards are better at hotels, the ambience is nicer but the food may not be as good as some reputable restaurants...i attended a dinner at Grand Copthorne Waterfront, the food was slightly better, but mainly because the guests included several Ministers and MPs...but after the dinner, i woke up at 3 feeling very hungry...some of my other friends had to buy food on their way home too...the servings kinda small...</p>
