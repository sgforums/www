            <div class='col-md body'>Today's papers again brought forth scandels of sexual abuse by Catholic priests, wonder how many more are swept under the carpet. Then there is this church robbed of 100K! OMG, why does a religious org have so much liquid assets on hand in the premises! In US$? Hmm, definately NOT takings from the weekend.<br><br>So, they're building a brand new 33 million church! 33 MILLION. U know, there is such thing known as renovation, upgrading. BUT all over S'pore, I've seen spanking church buildings being demolished and rebuilt! what happened to giving to charity? Seems like bulk of the takings simply goes BACK to glorifying the churches at a tremendous waste of resources. Honestly, after squandering 33million, how much more is left for charity? Corrupt? U decide.<br><br>Of course, there are those dinky lil' churches, but few youngsters go to those, and it seems the cycle of splurging is partly to entice the young who dun like dinky lil' churches.<br><br>I have a problem with christianity today, not christianity per se. Sure, pple have right to belief, but when it starts infringing on others, becomes commercialise, tainted and unpure with scandels and in-fighting, wield political power, and stir up tension, I say NAY.<br><br>It is not your good deeds that have impact, it is the dirty linen. Some house cleaning will make yourself much more credible. Btw, it is not unique to Christianity, Thai monks also kena alot of flak, but Christianity today takes the cake. Just look at Bush Jr go shooting his mouth abt 'axis of evil', tell me that is not a blatant exploitation to rake up religious fervour. Lo and behold, it works, his popularity is at 80%!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>at least fervent religious practices have been condemned to the past.. with a few remnants here and there..<br><br>take for example northern ireland, where the power of they chuch seemed to transcend from the past..<br><br>people tend to drag reality and religion together.. is religion reality? is religion explaining reality? is reality explaining religion..<br><br>from the past, europe for example, people based their lives on the one church, the 'cathedral', the central apex of their life. everything on earth can be explained thru the church. often, their decisions and those of the state are ruled soely by the church.. ie.. the monarch is 'god' chosen and has the absolute power..<br><br>but as technology advanced, we see 'thinkers' emerged. This is when the 'enlightenment' started. People start to see other forms of thinking, they dun see the church as the one and mighty.. There was doubts to the absolute monarch..<br><br>The protestants were so called cos they were people who protested!<br><br>Religion has always been an issue through history of civillised time... and wil stay as long as history stays..<br><br>But one must seek to remember that, not everything can be explained by religion alone, not is everything explainable. Everyone has his/her own mind, you can decide how your world to be explained. But dun try to impose 'PERSONAL' thoughts on matters of religion when there isn't a demand for it cos there isn't any right or wrong.<br><br>Does 'god' allow profiteering and scandals?<br><br>Is this even a valid question.<br><br>DO u think he exists?<br><br>If he does.. you must follw his way.. then you can use terms such as profit and scandals.<br><br>If you dun tink he exist, u can think about profit and scandals as being the nature of man.<br><br>I ask u, are u really interested in why 'god' allow it(do u believe in him in the first place). are you trying to disprove him in front of others?? think b4 u post such material. It serves no purpose cos there isn't a fixed way to see this issue.

It is a question, not a statement. ie, how do u reconcile what is preached, and what is actually happening?<br><br>"from the past, europe for example, people based their lives on the one church, the 'cathedral', the central apex of their life. everything on earth can be explained thru the church. often, their decisions and those of the state are ruled soely by the church.. ie.. the monarch is 'god' chosen and has the absolute power.."<br><br>The problem here is that the church has always, and continue today, to exert control and influence over the people within its wings. To the people who truly believe, the church is still the one answer that shld not be refuted.<br><br>"But dun try to impose 'PERSONAL' thoughts on matters of religion when there isn't a demand for it cos there isn't any right or wrong."<br><br>But this so untrue, christian doctrine insists they're right and all others are wrong. What do u mean? I assume u a believer, how do u reconcile such double standards?<br><br>I admit religions are critical, but the way christianity is structured, changes and evolution only serve to demonstrate that truth and perfection is not what it is, yet it is a central claim which it is built upon.<br><br>"at least fervent religious practices have been condemned to the past.. with a few remnants here and there.."<br><br>Do u not see, to the people in that age, it is the accepted way, just like 300yrs from now, pple may refer to our age of religions as fervent, overzealous and misguided.<br><br>I think very well and thorough before I post, end of the day, u're unwilling to affirm the factual observation that a)Scandels rock religious organisations, from cults to churches alike. b)Lots of money is involved, much of which goes back to benefit the churches rather than to do good as preached by christianity. Also, there is lack of accountability, if sex scandels can exist, I don't see why not a 'lesser evil' of corruption, the conditions are perfect.<br><br>"Axis of evil".....pls, from day one of 911, reference to 'evil', 'crusade against evil', 'war against evil'. I see more references to evil than Nazi Germany, a word with religious/mythical connotations. 'Axis of evil' is the newest version. If I see Axis here, Axis there, from day 1 of 911, I'll believe u, try to think objectively rather than what u want to percieve. We know that US is the largest christian country, and basically, religion has become another tool to fan the fires, difference to Osama?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with you CS. Why the church had so much money and not put to good use but used for renovation, upgrading etc etc? Luckily my 10% not inside contributing to their stupid cause. These resources can otherwise be used for alot of meaningful stuffs saving more pple or indulging in technology that will ultimately save the mankind instead of glorifying a human belief that has no concrete proofs.</div>
