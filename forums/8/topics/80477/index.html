            <div class='col-md body'>My side of the story, anyone???<br><br>Well like I mentioned in one of my last few post, no one ever bother to know my side of the story. Guess it is not as exciting as someone getting booted out from the Forum, namely me.<br><br>I have thought about it long and hard, if I want to post them up in sgForums as my last message before I leave, or should I just disappear from sgForums totally and assume the blame that everybody already impose on me and some of the fellow forumites. You might not really get to read this message because I should be banned by that time, and hopefully some righteous person can continue the legacy and let anyone who is interested in knowing my side of the story read them.<br><br>I guess the plot of the story is pretty simple, as many girls as possible stand up and accuse me of wrong doing, the rest of the crowd join-in and chase me out. Then all settle down, enjoy and have fun over at Madam Wong, celebrating among themselves a job well done.<br><br>The story starts simply as Me having a secret relationship with EM... Secret because only a handful of people knew about it. Started out as a no commitment relationship because we didn't want the pressure of me assuming the role as a replacement for SnH, ex-lover of EM. We have wanted it to go with the flow. Despite the condition of EM at that moment, where a relationship with her is dangerous and may jeapodize some paperworks that she is currently processing. And prior to that period, EM also had some adhoc relationship with some of the forumites, Zee? Who else? You know who you are. (Oh and why did I mentioned names? Because some of the personal issues I shared with her, she has to share it with the world and was used against me. Sorry EM, my fault to confide in you.)<br><br>How did con sex issue happens? Well I dunno, having sex the first time with her, and her hamsters sleeping just right beside us, I don't believe I force her into submission. The rest is history.<br><br>Con Money? Yes she bought me a gift that I very much appreciated, A foot massager, which I never asked her to get it for me, but too bad, last tuesday during their pullout mission, she pull it out. And I have to ask, does that make me con money? If yes, what about the dildo I bought for her? Maybe it is just 2nd hand, but it still worth more than a foot massager I pressume. And when you pull out the foot massager, how come you didn't leave the dildo behind? Since you want things to be clear out and nothing to do with me?<br><br>Con feeling, well I admit, there were feelings involved as time past. I am not as heardless as some of you may think. I still have the log file of the last few days of February, where you totally not talking to me while I am still trying to establish a communications. If anyone is actually interested in the logfile, let me know. I am sure you guys know how to find me.<br><br>So shall we move on?<br><br>HK... I will follow the format used to explain the issue with EM, and to be apply here as well.<br><br>First, Con money... Yes HK did issued me a Sub card with her DBS Platinum credit card, and I am grateful about it because it is not easy for me to go around always settle everything in cash, she had been really thoughtful. But when you want to brand me as con money, have you consider that I pay 1,000USD, directly into her Citibank account for her to settle some of her old payments, for two purpose, one, so the credit limit will be loosen up, two, as prepaid to things that I will be purchasing.<br><br>And yes, right after that, we purchased a few items from Harvey Norman in Millenia Walk, and yes the amount may be somewhere between 1,000 to 1,200. But from that point till now, the one month circulation period had not lapse, and the billing hasn't arrived yet, therefore no way of knowing how much I need to settle on things I used, and will that also qualify as in cheating people's money?<br><br>Secondly, Con-sex... How did it all began? We had lunch? Then was about to give her a massage, she had all her clothes off, as she mention in her own words, "I am not ashame of showing of my body." And the rest is history, right after that, we are more or less consider as an item. But why was it in secret again? Well as she mentioned again in her own words, "I don't want people to know that I am with you, or else no guys will be interested in me anymore."<br><br>Con-feelings, yes there were feelings involved, and I admit on this aspect I am at fault. May not have handled the feeling part properly. But in no way cheat-feelings as some of you claim.<br><br>Next, Ah Ma and FireIce, I have no idea where they fit in the picture, as of the moment, I am still clueless, wanting to know you, talking with you, joking with you, if those are all consider as SIAN, then I am at fault. And I am sorry to cause any inconvenience.<br><br>JB, well I just know that you know alot, and also know that your fiance loves you. So don't try any stunt with fellow forumite ladies again. And yes, you know who you are.<br><br>Jake, I really have no idea what ticks you off, and what is your involvement in all these, as I can see, sgForums is your domain, and if some of the member in here gets hurt, you feel you are responsible, and wish to take action, that is a great spirit. But please, don't play games/politics if you are not familiar with it. Don't just listen to your friend's complain and you assume you know it all. And some of the things I revealed to EM was very personal and confidential, and I trusted her enough to share them with her, and now was being used by you guys against me.<br><br>Two of the greatest mystery figure in this forum I need to help clear their name with whatever is left of my credibility, is Estee and sgboy2004. Estee is a totally innocent bystander, who said the wrong thing at the wrong time, and wanting to stand up for some of us at the wrong place. Thank you anyway. She just happen to be playing pool with me a little too often and people starts to frame her up with issues. I have to apologize for that.<br><br>sgboy2004. Yes, I guess this is what everyone really wanting to know. What is really with sgboy2004. sgboy2004 is a really close friend, and someone I can confide with. Nothing more. This might sound disappointing for most of you, she needed a shelter for a couple of days to settle some personal issues, I provided her. Anything more than that? Well if you consider, water, electricity and food as part of it, yes I did offered her those. Her issue? Well simple, as most of you should know by now, Croco was her Ex-BF for the past 4 years, so she is not really as naive in the relationship, recently, he proposed for a breakup again for the nth time, and without hestitation, sgboy2004 agreed, she had enoughed. I am sure he regretted after that, which he shows up in sgForums posting all those hoping sgboy2004 will read it and will change her mind, unfortunately she didn't.<br><br>The whole incident didn't happened as most of you would hope it should have happened, sgboy2004 didn't want to admit being cheated in a relationship with me because there wasn't any relationship, and we don't think we need to justify everything we do to everyone who wants to know. So everyone starts guessing. The rest just followed the crowd, crying foul play.<br><br>Well I am off to do real world stuff as some of you has suggested. Good luck to all.<br></div>
