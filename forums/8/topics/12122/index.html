            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think I'll be reading this book firstly because I read Chinese books like a turtle, and secondly, because I don't like the author too much from what I've read about her. She has this higher-than-thou attitude towards both Chinese and Singapore women. What she says about Chinese women, I think all should know already. I also remember her saying that Singapore women are shallow and not very well-read at all.<br>And I don't agree with her on her opinion about Chinese women coming here only to seek money or find rich husbands. Pls correct me if I'm wrong and that this isn't what the book is about - I don't really follow Chinese literature that much.</div>
