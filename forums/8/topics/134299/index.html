            <div class='col-md body'>they ask us to take public transport leh!!!<br><br>but hor what is public transport? is Taxi considered as public transport? When I take taxi, I am consider a innocent pedestrain correct? BUT WHY DO WE INNOCENT PEDESTRAINS HAVE TO PAY ERP WHEN WE TAKE TAXI?<br><br>maybe i stupid, cos i onli had PSLE level, but is taxi not considered public transport meh? In the first place, why izzit buses and taxis have to pay ERP huh? their numbers not controlled meh? If so, why must ERP be imposed on them?<br><br>cos i study very little, so i wan to ask : does it mean that if buses and taxis are exempted from ERP, then all the buses and taxis will rush into ERP areas? i think its very funny lor. or they scared that if taxis are exempted from ERP, everyone will scrap their private cars and all switch to driving taxis?<br><br>i really dunno lor, but when im at orchard hor, i very hard to take cabs lor. the ERP areas are devoid of taxis especially during peak hours. u try to take a cab at pargo bugis junction taxi stand lar and see how frustrating it is to take a cab. No cab driver will want to pay ERP to go in lor. so i always wait long long. sometimes more than 3hrs leh and always long queue. LTA dun want to attract tourists to come here to shop izzit?<br><br>if yes, then why are they not making it attractive for taxis to go into ERP areas huh? Why must taxi taking passengers pay ERP huh? We are not car owners leh but hor we are being penalised for that lor.<br><br>soli my english very poor cos i study till psle onli.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>ERP hours to be extended for Orchard Rd, CTE areas<br>By Dominique Loh, Channel NewsAsia<br><br>SINGAPORE : The Land Transport Authority is adding new Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) gantries along the Central Expressway (CTE) and Orchard Road in an effort to ease peak hour traffic flow in those areas.<br><br>ERP operating hours at Orchard Road will also be extended by an hour and into the weekend.<br><br>The LTA wants to cut the link between Orchard Road and the rest of the Central Business District.<br><br>This is because its own survey had found that about 30 percent of motorists bypass Orchard Road without stopping to shop.<br><br>And that adds to the traffic snarl towards the end of each day.<br><br>Dr Chin Kian Keong, Chief Engineer of Transportation at LTA, said: "What we want is to have Orchard as a distinct cordon from the CBD and so we can introduce different charges at different times of the day. The intent is to benefit genuine shoppers so those who are using Orchard to bypass the CBD will be discouraged from doing so."<br><br>Two gantries will be added near the former Cathay Building and near the YMCA.<br><br>From October, the Orchard Road gantries will charge between 50 cents and $2.50 during weekdays and 50 cents on Saturdays.<br><br>All the Orchard Road ERP charges will end at 8pm.<br><br>The ERP charges at Orchard will be independent from the charges going into the CBD.<br><br>This is because of the difference in traffic patterns in both areas.<br><br>In October when the change takes effect, at least it would not cost motorists anything to go into Orchard during the morning hours.<br><br>Reactions from motorists are mixed.<br><br>"What? I have to pay again to get out?"<br><br>"I think it's better."<br><br>For motorists living in the northern parts of Singapore, going home may cost them a little more when they use the Central Expressway.<br><br>From August 1 on weekdays from 6pm to 8pm, motorists heading north along the CTE will be charged between 50 cents and a dollar.<br><br>LTA said initially, it had deferred using ERP charges to control traffic jams.<br><br>In 2002, it widened the expressway with one additional lane.<br><br>The opening of the North East MRT line also provided alternatives for commuters.<br><br>Dr Chin added: "That helped but did not help for very long. Six months later, and today it is just as congested as before. So the ERP gantry is to help manage traffic conditions so that the CTE will be optimised and traffic will flow at its optimal condition."<br><br>Apart from revamping the ERP system from time to time, the LTA is also encouraging commuters to consider using alternative routes and public transportation to help ease Singapore's traffic woes.<br><br>Last year, the LTA collected about $77 million from ERP charges alone. It maintains the latest ERP changes were not designed as a revenue generating exercise. - CNA/de<br></div>

Instead they are implementing it on weekdays evenings too lo! Poor drivers who live in the north will have no choice but to pay for it when they go home from work. Its not alleviating the traffice jam problem at all as these people die die will have to take that route home. The problem lies with the increasing development of the northern area (more people living there in new estates like Sengkang and Punggol) but no new infrastructures to facilitate north-south travelling, hence the govt should open up more roads or e-way to allow these people to travel north-south instead of implementing the ERP which is a no-brainer short-cut "solution".</div>
