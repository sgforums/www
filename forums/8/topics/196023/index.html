            <div class='col-md body'>The Village That Disappeared<br><br>An individual that vanishes is one thing, but how about an entire village of 2,000 men, women and children? In November, 1930, a fur trapper named Joe Labelle made his way on snow shoes to an Eskimo village on the shores of Lake Anjikuni in northern Canada. Labelle was familiar with the village, which he knew as a thriving fishing community of about 2,000 residents. When he arrived, however, the village was deserted. All of the huts and storehouses were vacant. He found one smoldering fire on which there was a pot of blackened stew. Labelle notified the authorities and an investigation was begun, and which turned up some bizarre findings: no footprints of any of the residents were found, if they had vacated the village; all of the Eskimos' sled dogs were found buried under a 12-foot-high snow drift - they had all starved to death; all of the Eskimos' food and provisions were found undisturbed in their huts. And there was one last unnerving discovery: the Eskimos' ancestral graves had been emptied.<br><br>1918<br><br>USS Cyclops: the navy coal ship, used to deliver fuel and other supplies to U.S. battlefleet during World War I, disappeared while en route from Brazil to Baltimore. The ship docked briefly at Barbados on March 3Â–4. When it failed to arrive in Baltimore on March 13, a search was made, but neither her wreck nor any of the 309 people aboard were ever found, and the cause of her loss remains unknown<br><br>1928<br><br>KÃ¶benhavn: five-masted Danish steel barque, a sail-training ship with a crew of 75 including 45 boy cadets, sailed from the River Plate for Melbourne, Australia, on Dec. 14. The last radio contact with the ship was made on Dec. 22 and all was well. The KÃ¶benhavn and its crew disappeared without a trace and no one knows what happened to it.<br><br>The Legend of David Lang<br><br>This famous case allegedly took place in September, 1880 on a farm near Gallatin, Tennessee in full view of several witnesses. The two Lang children, George and Sarah, were playing in the front yard of the family home. Their parents, David and Emma, came out the front door, and David headed off across a pasture toward his horses. At this time, a buggy carrying family friend Judge August Peck was approaching. David turned to walk back to the house, saw the buggy and waved to the judge as he strode across the field. A few seconds later, David Lang - in clear view of his wife, his children and the judge - disappeared in mid-step. Emma screamed and all of the witnesses rushed to the spot where David once was, thinking perhaps he had fallen into a hole of some kind. There was no hole. A thorough search by the family, friends and neighbors turned up nothing. A few months after the unexplained disappearance, the Lang children noticed that the grass on the spot where their father vanished had turned yellow and wilted in a circle measuring about 15 feet in diameter</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i can shed some light on the USS Cyclops.<br><br>1stly, the design of the USS Cyclops as a collier meant that she had a certain degree of flex allowed in her design. Of course we know now this isn't a good design, as not only did USS Cyclops was lost at sea, 2 of her 3 sister ships were also lost at sea, although they were presumed sunk(but not for certain) by German U-Boats.<br><br>Anyways, it was theorized that she could have run into a storm which flexed her hull so much she got torn open. Although technically there wasn't any wreckage found, there was an oil slick and a lifevest off that was later found close to each other.<br><br>n his 1975 book The Bermuda Triangle Mystery Solved, author Lawrence Kusche investigated this mystery. Kusche has soundly demonstrated that the Cyclops most likely went down between Cape Hatteras and Cape Charles under a heavy gale that struck the east coast on the 9th and 10th of March. During the raging winds and high seas, the ship's cargo of 10,000 tons of manganese probably shifted and she rolled over and sank without warning or time to send an SOS.<br><br>The Cyclops still remains the largest navy ship ever lost without leaving the slightest clue to her fate.<br><br>No clue turned up until 1968 when master navy diver, Dean Hawes, descended on a large hulk lying in 180 feet of water about 40 nautical miles northeast of Cape Charles. Hawes was stunned. He found himself standing on a vessel unlike any he'd ever seen. The bridge sat on steel stilts above the deck and huge arms stretched upward along the main deck into the liquid gloom.<br><br>Hawes finally surfaced with the intention of going down again with his dive team, but bad weather forced the navy salvage ship to abandon the wreck and sail back to Norfolk. The dive exercise was rumored to be a searching for the then missing nuclear submarine, Scorpion that was later found on the bottom west of the Azores, and the navy felt no need to spend unnecessary time investigating the wreck further.<br><br>Years later, Hawes happened to read an article on the mystery of the Cyclops. Included was a picture of the ship, exactly what Hawes had explored.<br><br>Hawes managed to convince the navy to return and check out the site again, but a different wreck was located and nothing resembling the Cyclops was found.<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>So, bermuda triangle mystery or explanable loss? I believe its a good thing to keep an open mind to all theories, thus I leave it up to you to decide.<br><br></div>

That is roughly the concept of transdimensional physics.</div>
