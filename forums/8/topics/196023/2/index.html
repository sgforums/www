            <div class='col-md body'>interesting topics as always expected from u ... u remind me of a sci-fi geek though. i tink parallel dimensions are damn cool and all that aliens stuff. hopefully we'll know one day  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>

THEORATICALLY, if we travel so fast that the time taken is 0, thats the "boundary" between our current time space, and another one. If we travel faster than that, then we would have reached out destination before we started. You would now be in a parallel universe with a different position in time space.</div>
