Go Hong Lim Park and speak up, go take part in election, oh yes, you will start to claim you not Singaporean, that is non of your business blah blah blah. Like what I said many time, no guts to stand out and talk, only good in gek seh online. If you are not that good, don't come here and make a fool out of yourself.
