A such, people became self-centered, interested only in knowing what's happening in their immediate circle of life.<br><br>I ca'nt help but feel that there's some truth in this statement. Take a look at this forum and you'll notice that most of the topics are centered on personal interest like  sex and girls.<br><br>Yeah, no doubt sex and girls are the number one topic among teenagers, but surely there are more rewarding things out there to be achieve.</div></blockquote>So what if ya know or ya don't...?

Well, for starters, you and I know who they are in your topic. Other than their occasional same postings of idiotic laughter coupled with mindless insults, they are nothing more than brainless stupid idiots who are unable to hold a logical and mature discussion. Maybe they craved for attention so badly, they just had to stick their thick numbskull in any topic. They think that they are "cool" and original without knowing that they are actually making a fool out of themselves. When they can't win an argument. they will resort to getting all their "buddies" together and harped on brainless totally unrelated things thinking that they can piss you off. Not that it work at all. Why, because if it did work, I would have left this forum, isn't it?<br><br>Sad to say, being a public forum, the possibility of hearing brainless orifices sprouting nonsense will always exists. Take it in your stride. Ignore them, no point wasting your energy to argue with them. At the end of the day, they are the one losing out. Let's just keep our fingers crossed that maybe one of these days, their smart alec attitude will get them into hot soup.<br><br>Well, after saying this, I know there will be noisy, maybe spontaneous and definitely brainless response from that particular group. What have I to said except that if they do that, they have proven my case beyond doubt. If they keep quiet, at least that will make the world a little nicer place than before.</div></blockquote>Thanks Pal, your statement sums up what I basically feels about these people.</div>
