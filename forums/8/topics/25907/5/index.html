But as you 'll probably realise by now, not only are they not interested in it but they also flood this topic with irrelevant comments. Out of the hundreds of posting in this topic, only a couple of people like you and me are really addressing the issues. Does this proves my point?<br><br>Well, maybe some people have taken my comments too seriously. But in general there is some degree of truth in it. My statement is'nt meant to make a mockery out of singaporeans. But instead, it's intention is meant to be a reflection on themselves. I want them to ask themselves are they ignorant as claimed by the foreigners?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>rudyiskandar<br><br>Apologies as I am not here to discuss your topic but rather to share my dislike for the very same group of people you prefer not to have in this forum. Well, for starters, you and I know who they are in your topic. Other than their occasional same postings of idiotic laughter coupled with mindless insults, they are nothing more than brainless stupid idiots who are unable to hold a logical and mature discussion. Maybe they craved for attention so badly, they just had to stick their thick numbskull in any topic. They think that they are "cool" and original without knowing that they are actually making a fool out of themselves. When they can't win an argument. they will resort to getting all their "buddies" together and harped on brainless totally unrelated things thinking that they can piss you off. Not that it work at all. Why, because if it did work, I would have left this forum, isn't it?<br><br>Sad to say, being a public forum, the possibility of hearing brainless orifices sprouting nonsense will always exists. Take it in your stride. Ignore them, no point wasting your energy to argue with them. At the end of the day, they are the one losing out. Let's just keep our fingers crossed that maybe one of these days, their smart alec attitude will get them into hot soup.<br><br>Well, after saying this, I know there will be noisy, maybe spontaneous and definitely brainless response from that particular group. What have I to say except that if they do that, they have proven my case beyond doubt. If they keep quiet, at least that will make the world a little nicer place than before.</div>
