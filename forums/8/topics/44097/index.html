            <div class='col-md body'>Well the song "Hotel California" was a song written about the drug scene and a specific place which they named Hotel California where people took drugs. Thats why you see lyrics..."'We are all just prisoners here, of our own device'  and also "You can checkout any time you like, but you can never leave!"<br><br>The word 'Colitas' meant 'little buds' of the marijuana plant, which can be made into drugs.<br><br>There are many songs which outright promotes Satanism, like Ugly Kid Joe's God Damned Devil where it sings "Rape, D.U.I., assault and battery. Those are the things that will bring you to me.............I'm the Goddamn Devil, this job pleases me...........We'll make a deal, you'll grow your hair. As Satan's child you'll start a band. And spread the word across the land"<br><br>There are many other songs like Led Zep's Stairway to heaven or ACDC's Highway to Hell.<br><br>What I insist that if you are not into it, dun touch it, these are things you do not know, dun mess with it. If you are into it, please show some common sense, music will be music, dun do what they ask you to do. The musicians can be just expressing their frustrations, not asking people to die. So though the musicians share the blame, the people who committed suicide has to take some of that discredit too.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah... i agree some of the songs's lyrics haf hidden meaning, which may be promoting satanism, or encourage death or other unlawful act e.g, rape, kill etc...  these type of song one got to listen n understand e lyrics, then do they truly understanding e meaning...<br><br>there r also other type of songs tat oni haf melody but no lyrics... songs like fifth element by sarah brightman... (not taking into consideration of classical music)....everytime i hear tat song, esp e chanting part, mades me wan to rock.... can't really describe e feeling...<br><br>things is, i feel tat songs wif no melody opens up e listener's mind with no boundaries... watever state of ur mind is in when u listen to tat kind of music, u think or react according to ur state of mind.... sad melody song will probably haf no effect on a person with no worries while it might made e person's feeling worse if he has a relationship problem when he listen to tat sad melody song...<br><br>(wat i wrote above is juz oni my view)...<br><br></div>
