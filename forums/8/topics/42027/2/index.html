Kind of..should have gone to Aussie and straight away enter Uni there.<br><br>I want to work in this industry of course. For how long? i Dont know.. maybe 7 years? my ultimate and final career would be as a lecturer. Good Money.. kinda easy job.<br><br>I never thought of changing courses but i want to add another course into my qualifications. Something like Business or Marketing. You gotta be more versatile in the future i guess.<br><br>Well, i dont think u can pursue all that ur interested in. Im interested in IT, Business, Marketing, Mass Comm, Film and Media Studies, History, Design stuff.. many more. But i had to make an ultimate choice, and i chose IT. Never regretted it.<br><br>But Singapore has such a small industry. It sucks. Gotta look at the world. Id work in Malaysia, Thailand, or vietnam if i have to. At least im going to take home expatriate's pay.</div>
