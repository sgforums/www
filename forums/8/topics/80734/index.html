            <div class='col-md body'>SYDNEY: Singaporean Ram Tiwary has appeared in court in Australia over the killing of two fellow students in their Sydney apartment last year.<br><br>Fellow Singaporeans Tay Chow Lyang and Tan Poh Chuan were in the final year of their engineering courses at the University of New South Wales when they were bludgeoned to death last September.<br><br>25-year old Tiwary was remanded in custody and charged with their murder on Saturday.<br><br>Police had described the crime as savage and brutal and set up a special task force to track down whoever was responsible.<br><br>The identity of the killer and the motive had remained a mystery as detectives interviewed dozens of friends of the dead men.<br><br>There was no sign of a forced entry, raising speculation that the killer had probably known his victims.<br><br>Then, on Friday detectives swooped on another apartment just down the road from the original murder scene.<br><br>A few hours later they arrested Tiwary who had been sharing a flat with the victims.<br><br>The accused had told police that he had slept through the attacks.<br><br>Tiwary's appearance in the Parramatta Bail court on Saturday lasted barely 30 seconds.<br><br>Dressed in a beige jacket and jeans, he didn't even have time to enter the dock before the magistrate remanded him in custody until Monday to appear at Sydney's Central Court.<br><br>Tiwary had been studying mechanical engineering at the University of New South Wales, but quit his studies this year.<br><br>Police said the families of the murdered Singaporean students were clearly relieved that an arrest had been made.<br><br>Their only reservation, a spokesman added, was that the Australian legal system, which does not have capital punishment, might not be able to impose a severe enough penalty if the accused is found guilty.<br><br>The deaths of the two young men, who were well-respected and regarded as exceptional students, sent shock waves through the university, which has a high proportion of Asian students.<br><br>Early fears that it was a racially-inspired attack were quickly discounted but the perceived lack of progress in identifying the killer only added to the mystery surrounding the crime.<br><br>One of the senior officers leading the task force said forensic evidence and thorough detective work had aided their enquiries.<br><br>If found guilty, Tiwary could face life imprisonment. - CNA<br><br></div>
