            <div class='col-md body'>Last week my gf wuz walking home from work and this stranger just pulls up next to her in a noisy beng car and said something like " Hi, do u live around here? do u want a lift?"<br><br>Of course she said no but the stranger even went to the extent of reaching over and opening the passenger door for her and asked again in a its-ok-u-can-trust-me-everybody's-doing-this-in-Singapore-i-just-want-to-give-u-a-lift-nothing-more kind of tone.<br><br>Am i missing something here? Are we such a close knit community of 3 million people that you will give lifts to fellow Singaporeans on the streets?<br><br>Of course i know his other intention ......but the nerve of pulling this off ........probably think that his oh-so-confident/reassuring tone will win girls trust...<br><br>comments pls?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well giving people a life used to be a friendly guesture done years ago when there were kampongs ard in Singapore.<br><br>Use to have to walk for miles just to get out to the main road and if a car pass they would usally give a life to those walking. But then everyone knew everyone.<br><br>In this "advance" city of Singapore now. I am surprised that someone would actually stop. With cars doing 80 in a 50 zone. hmm does Singaporean know wat are brakes anymore. So take it as a compliment to your friend. She must be a real looker. Cheers<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well it all depends really. Maybe he was really genuine? Or thenagain, he could have just been thick skin.<br><br>But this brings me to another point. I find that Singaporeans are pretty suspicious of each other. To the extent it becomes hard  to actually do nice things for a fellow person.<br><br>Like I was in a life and I could have gone out first, but there was this old lady behind me so I thought I'd let her go out first. It would have been easier for me to get out first but Ithought one should hold the door open for ladies and odler folk. So i backed up a bit to allow the lady to go out and I think I pissed off other ppl who wanted to get out fast.<br><br>And when u open the door for ladies a whole stream of ppl will come out too.<br><br>So maybe we shouldn't be so supicious. I mean in the West, ppl freely chat up others and they don't find it weird. We do.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>to zippo<br>i agree that we shouldnt be too suspicious<br>but lemme add some more details to wat happpened<br><br>I think that if it was raining heavily or if there was a cylone or tidal wave approaching then maybe i was too suspicious.<br><br>But it seems that this guy pulled up alongside her once, drove off, and when she turned into the next street, she saw him drive past slowly on the other side then next thing she noe, he stop for her<br>Also, while my gf didnt take the lift, the guy handed her his namecard and asked her to call him.......<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Probably a fucker out to score no matter what!!!  Assholes...I really dtest these kinds of people...<br><br>My thinking has always been that many people who own cars here in Singaproe think that they are GOD because they have one..Just because they have one, other people should kowtow to them and do things for them, and things should be theirs by rights....Look at the news lately...all these idiots getting angry on the news and papers because their right to park wherever they feel like it is being "taken" away(it's not like they never knew what the lines in the roads were for)...<br><br>Why they get angry...because they think their owning cars gives them this right to do whatever they want...Why is it that I only ever hear about people getting killed in Singapore on the shoulder of the road where it is only reserved for cars that broke down...(never drive on this lane).  If I remember correctly, a few people got hit and runover and they died because some fool with a car thinks that he/she can drive wherever he damn well pleases.  Oh God...get a life man, not a car...<br><br>I've met a lot of ok people who drive cars and bikes, but a lot of them got some kind of gaping prsonality flaws that they cover up by buying these expensive toys...ie, their dicks are too small.<br><br>I realise that a lot of people here buy cars for the prestige of it...I say this because we all know it...When people tell me that they *need* cars, i totally don't believe them.  Singapore is so small, u can get to wherver it is u wanna go by public transport..Don't tell me, public transport is too slow...blah blah blah..<br><br>The fact is that Singapore public transport is the envy of almost all Western nations...and most Asian ones...not to mention 3rd world countries...:-)<br><br>Talking from someone who can compare...It only takes what....15 minutes longer, max...to reach where u wanna go by bus than by car.  I did this experiment once to check the feasability of owning a vehical in Sinagpore....I took a cab the whole day long...Going from my place to town and then another part of town...blah blah blah..<br><br>The next day I did the same thing...and u know what?  Few minutes difference only...and cheaper...and in most instances, faster because traffic doesn't stop MRT.:-)<br><br>And the cost of ownership makes it really a pleasure toy thn anything else....Of course those business people need them for whatever it is they use it for, but the normal guy?...and more importantly young guys?<br><br>Singaporeans are one of the worst group of drivers in the world.  When we first came here, we almost got sideswiped coming home from the airport and I almost got ran over many times by idiots who think they own the road.<br><br>Back to the point....It seems that many youths who own vehicals are basically juvenile punks who haven't matured enough yet to be driving....It's a big responsibility...so big that most people here can't meet up to it...<br><br>WE all know that a lot of BENGs!!!...like to use their cars as tools to fuck chicks with. Let me just point out that it's the car that the chicks are fucking and not the guy...of course to idiots like this one who tries to get fresh with ur GF, they don't care and don't understand this....brain too small eh...Brain ah.  uhhhhh....whatsh that?<br><br>It was most likely that he was planning on raping her if she did get in.  I've been in Sinagpore long enough to know that people don't offer lifts to strangers unless the circumstances arises...and even then most wouldn't offer.<br><br>In the west, we don't offer lifts to strangers walking home...it doesn't happen. While we are more openm and friendlier with people in general, there is a line that isn't crossed....<br><br>Driving up to  a complete stranger...and a young girl...offer a lift...slowly lurking around....<br>...shouldn't this be ringing any alarm bells?  KLANG KLANG KLANG!!!!! Hello!!!I see batard using his car in an attempted rape case....<br>Don't be too sure that it wouldn't happen.  It could...and i'm glad for ur GF and u that she didn't take the lift.<br><br>If u ever find out who it is and want the hammer of God to slam into his shiny car...hint, hint....let me know...I gots some ideas.....<br><br>BTW-I've been in the cars of some young guys I know and they drive like maniacs who think that Singapore is one big race track...idiots...even tried to challenge a bus and a lorry....fucker...ever see what happens to a car after it hits a lorry?  U see what I mean?  Not matured enought to know the consequences of what happens when u don't use the car properly.  I for one, think that the driving penalty for crashing/breaking road rules/ and killing someone with ur car is too little.  It gives the wrong message to idiots who shouldn't be behind the wheel.  In the USA, if u hit someone with ur car, they charge u with assault witha deadly weapon and can land u 10 years jail....If u end up killing someone or causing someone to die with ur vehical, it's considered murder with a deadly weapon....(something like that)and u can get 20years-to life for that.  It's like 5 years for killing someone here or using it for fucked up purposes....<br><br>A lot of CAr owners and a lot of bike owners are asshole jerks and they need to suck my ass before they can drive again...<br><br>ps-doesn't apply to the people who are responsible in their use of their vehicals...:-)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey there!<br><br>first off i think there are no two ways about it. the pick up guy is a dickhead and can clearly stoop lower than the bottom of his tyres. But I think we need to get something clear. what exactly has dickhead done wrong? was it WHAT he did? or HOW he did it? i mean would it have been more okay if he tried hitting on ur gf in orchard road or along the streets? would it have been okay in a pub? after all he didn't know she was attached. would you and i have done that to some other girl? (personally i wouldn't). the thing here is that are u pissed at what he did or are u pissed at what ALL pick-up guys do (car or no car)? you're prob extra pissed cos she's ur gf. but does that mean all pick up guys are scum of the earth? u noe how it's like sometimes.....u see a girl and then say to yourself, "heck! i've been a good guy all this time, surely santa wouldn't bypass my chimney this christmas if i hit on that sweet girl at the information counter? i mean, my frens always say that the reason i'm not attached is cos i don't try hard enuf. so well okay....just this once." if this guy i just described were ur fren, would u blame him? then of coz the dickhead seemed more like a serial picker-up....i mean circling like a bloody vulture and all. but was it what he did? or how he did it? to me, the fact that he is trying this shows that he's prob been successful before. thatz why he keeps trying. so blame not just him but also those girls who give such guys a chance by actually riding home with him, or who actually call him later with that namecard he whipped out. these are prob the same gals who would complain on a forum like this why there are no good guys out there after he screws her then dumps her just as quickly as he held the car door open. only to open the door again for some other unsuspecting lady....<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>It's not that he's a pick up artist I don't think....<br><br>There is something really insidious about driving around trying to look for unsuspecting girls...in ur car some more....<br><br>It's really insidious.  It's a premediatation (planned intention) to either pick up someone or rape them...<br><br>Fading Star, are u Singaporean?  Just wondering....because in the West, everyone is smart enough to know that anyone trying to give u a lift is probably in it to forcefully take it from u.<br><br>and it's different picking someone up oin the street or pub and in a car.  When u drive up to a girl and iopen ur door to ask her for a ride, that car can be used as a tool for really dastardly deeds...and who would see...quick get away right.<br><br>I don't know about anyone else, but cars this is what makes it different from the usual pick-up.  If ever I find that some guy with a car tried to give my GF a lift and I ever see him, he's going to get more than a piece of my mind.....And I don't mind guys trying to pick up my GF....I'm not scared...but driving around in a car looking for girls..when she's walking alone....imagine how scared she must have been.....believe me, someone tried to offer me a lift twice before at night (I'm a guy!!!), and I can tell u, it's a really eery feeling...it's a feelign that u know that if anything should happen, he can get away and no passerbys will be able to ID him...security in ur car...that's how it is...</div>
