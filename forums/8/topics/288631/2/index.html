            <div class='col-md body'>had never encountered one before. But had on some instants could be beside one but didn't realized.<br><br>One is during NCC camp in sec sch. Was outfield, was peeing at the peeing area at night. Friends were around, but not exactly near me.  Few days after the camp they told be they saw something above me when peeing. It sort of illuminated me.<br><br>One is in a hotel room in Hayat several years back. The room was furnished with a mixture of wood and cane furniture. At night, when the lights were off, I can hear creaking from the furniture. Mum (whole family in room) kept getting up and switch on the lights to find out where the creaking came from, but I couldn't be bother. One of our neighbour room claimed they heard soft scratching at the bottom of the door, but couldn't see anyone when they open it.<br>- Tour guide said nothing about it when asked about the incidents the next day but it was known that the hotel s not clean. Some others speculated the creaking could come from "something" sitting on the cane furniture. And the scratching could be from "something" small trying to get in.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just remembered many years ago when i was in primary 5 , one of the pri school ard jurong which was the one i attending , was rumoured to be able to hear baby crying in one of the cubicle in the gers toilet . Very soon many female students dare not use the toilet and even the light was switched off all the time making it even more errie . Once while we were trying to peep inside , one of our male teachers i think was instructed to check the toilet out walk briskly right in to do his ahem then abt 3 mins later came out using a handkerchief to wipe " water " on his face keeping quiet . Curious we went to the door of the toilet to peep in but din see or hear anything , while 2 of my male friends went in also never see anything then we went away .<br>But abt 2 weeks later , our principal made an announcement during assembly that that particulor toilet is not not haunted as rumoured to be and will take actions againts anyone who says it agn . But nevertheless noone ever dare to use that toilet n i think not long after that it was lock up ever since .<br>Anyway i also heard another rumour years later that there was a coffin of a particulor school principal coincidently was the first principal of the school situated also in the west area and his last wish was to be buried within the school compound</div>
