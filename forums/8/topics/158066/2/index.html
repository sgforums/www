            <div class='col-md body'>The reality now is that China and USA need each other so badly that they will not want to go to war with each other.<br><br>American consumers are importing more Chinese goods than ever before and this helps to drive the Chinese economy.<br><br>China is now the the second largest buyer of US T-bills. In the financial world, China is fast becoming one of the biggest lenders to America. In fact, Chinese money is keeping the US afloat. What do I mean by this?<br><br>One good example: In the year 2003 when the US went to war with Iraq... Obviously they need a lot of money to go to war. Where did the $$$ come from? Apparently to finance the Iraq War the US sold government bonds. Who bought them all? Japan and China. Why? To protect the value of those US dollar reserves.<br><br>Here's an interesting article on Sino-US relationship:<br><br>http://www.davidmcwilliams.ie/Articles/view.asp?CategoryID=-1&amp;CategoryName=&amp;ArticleID=108<br><br>In fact the US is already one of the most indebted countries in the world with over 7 trillion dollars in debt. Here's a related link:<br><br>http://www.toptips.com/debtclock.html<br><br>The last thing US wants is a war with China and vice versa.<br><br></div>

Still, the Americans were still able to defeat them, but I believe the American lost quite a lot of soldiers as well (Full Metal Jacket, Hamburger Hill, TigerLand, Forrest Gump). Probably, I believe it has to be the forest condition and jungle fighting. Besides, there was an outcry to bring their marines back because it was not their war anywayz...<br><br>Mel Gibson who played a famous lieutenant colonel quoted his words in the movie and said that he didn't want to go to their country and attack them to send them back home, because they are already home.<br><br>Till now, I donno whether should the American be considered to have won the war.<br><br>The same went to North Korea, lines of soldiers from that country are used as human shield against the machine gun. This goes to show their love for their country. After one line fall, another would come up. This line was endless, and the marines fought until their minds were disturbed and disrupted.
