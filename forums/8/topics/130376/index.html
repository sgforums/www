            <div class='col-md body'>Andy, a rookie teenager had been staying in this warm and peaceful neighbourhood of Toa YoYo for 5 years. He loved the people and the food, but he hated school. After dropping out at Sec 3, he worked part-time selling handphones at one of the ah beng handphone shops at Toa YoYo Central. One day, his boss told him that there was a more important task for Andy. The boss had decided to venture into selling VCDs and he felt that Andy is trustable and hardworking, so he let Andy run the stall situated at Lorong 6. Andy was very keen to take up this challenge. Commission was high and better still, he could preview the VCDs!<br><br>Business was good. VCDs were in high demand and Andy made a lot of sales, especially the P-series VCDs. Soon he had his own pool of loyal customers. The crowd grew and word got around. Customers from all over Singapore flocked to buy VCDs (P-series and otherwise) from Andy.<br><br>Issac from Tenpenis heard about this stall in Toa YoYo and was very interested to go take a look. He was shy so he dragged his best friend, Leon along. The both of them took the MRT to Toa YoYo and finally found the stall at Lorong 6. Issac and Leon browsed the titles and were amazed that they were very updated and the price was very reasonable. At first they only buy movies, but as curious teenagers, they started to buy the P-series VCDs. They made their weekly trip to Toa YoYo to stock up their collection.<br><br>Back at home, Issac and Leon watched the VCDs together. They even took screen captures of their favourite busty actresses to post at their favourite website sggurls.com to share. Their hobby became their indulgence.<br><br>One day, Leon got an SMS from Andy that there was a new hot P-series episode that was just released. (excellent Customer Relationship Management!)  Leon and Issac happily went to Andy's stall to purchase. They could not wait to check it out since it was touted as one of the best "home-made" P-series in town. They took a cab back to Leon's house in Peeshan and eagerly played the VCD on Leon's laptop.<br><br>A few minutes into the scene, Issac gasped and banged the table. "Hey! That's me and my girlfriend Kelisa! Remember on her birthday we took video of us having fun? I uploaded to our sendtoyou one. Who took my video and make into P-series VCD?!"<br>Leon was shocked too. But he asked Issac how he knew the couple in the video was him and Kelisa when the faces were mosaic-ed? Issac replied "It's my video of course I know lah!" He was fuming and yelling vulgarities at the top of his voice. "Let's find Andy!" Issac said and grabbed Leon out of the house, flagged a cab and rushed to Toa YoYo to confront Andy.<br><br>Andy was seated beside his stall, smoking when he saw the 2 angry boys stomping towards him.<br>"Kaninah! How come you have me and my girlfriend's P-series video?" Issac spewed as he throw the VCD at Andy. He shouted so loud that other patrons at the stall heard and all gave him weird stares. Leon pulled Issac to one side, "Shhh, now they also know is you liao lah!"<br>At that moment, Issac realised he had exposed himself to the crowd that had gathered around the stall to watch the commotion. Andy coolly said, "All these are from suppliers leh, and I got watch also. Mosaic already, I also cannot recognise it's you leh, bro"<br>Not wanting to embarass himself further, Issac told Andy to recall all the P-series VCDs of him and his girlfriend and destroy them. Then he walked off. Leon, wanting to stand by his friend, gave Andy an angry stare and said, "For God's sake, stop selling these VCDs" and quickly followed behind Issac.<br><br>After closing the stall, Andy went to find his boss and told him about the incident. The boss traced to the supplier, Benny. Benny said his assistant found the video clip on the web. He found it to be of very good quality and confident it would sell well, so he burn it into VCD and supply to the resellers. Andy, not wanting to blow up the matter, told the boss to stop selling that particular P-series episode. Boss said okay.<br><br>Andy sent SMS to Issac to tell him the matter resolved already but Issac did not want to let it rest. He and Leon went around Toa YoYo telling people that Andy was a bad guy and invaded people's privacy by selling "home-made" P-series VCDs. Andy, being magnanimous, did not let such rumours bother him and continue managing his business. However, Issac and Leon still harped on the matter, making things difficult for Andy. After a few weeks, Andy decided that he should take preventive measures in case such things happened again. He did not want to be pointed at for something caused by others' own carelessness. So he switched to selling Cartoons and Animation VCDs, something for the whole family and general audience. Titles like Shrek, Little Mermaid, Lion King, Finding Nemo, The Incedibles sold very well and nobody complained. Some of Andy's old customers requested for P-series VCDs but Andy rejected them and told them to look elsewhere.<br><br>Issac, seeing that the VCD business was doing well, wanted to start his own too. He rented a stall in Tenpenis, and started selling VCDs with Kelisa. Occasionally, they dropped by Toa YoYo to check on how Andy was doing. Still bearing the grudge, they continued to spread rumours about Andy in Toa YoYo. However, with Andy's good reputation and company policy to abide, he was not afraid. He knew that to survive, one got to be mature and cool-headed.<br><br>And he lived happily ever after...<br><br><span class="small"><span style="font-style: italic;">Characters purely fictional.
