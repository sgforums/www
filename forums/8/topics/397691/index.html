              <p>A professor stood before his philosophy class and had some items in 
              front of him.  When the class began, wordlessly, he picked up a very 
              large and empty mayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with golf balls.
                He then asked the students if the jarwas full.  They agreed that it 
              was.<br> <br>The professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured 
              them into the jar.  He shook the jar lightly.  The pebbles rolled into 
              the open areas between the golf balls.  He then asked the students again
               if the jar was full.  They agreed it was.<br><br>The professor next 
              picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar.  Of course, the sand
               filled up everything else.  He asked once more if the jar was full.  
              The students responded with a unanimous "yes."<br> <br>The professor 
              then produced two cups of coffee from under the table and poured the 
              entire contents into the jar, effectively filling the empty space 
              between the sand.  The students laughed.<br><br>"Now," said the 
              professor, as the laughter subsided, "I want you to recognize that this 
              jar represents your life."<br> <br>The golf balls are the important 
              things-your God, family, your children, your health, your friends, and 
              your favorite passions - things that if everything else was lost and 
              only they remained, your life would still be full.<br> <br>The pebbles 
              are the other things that matter like your job, your house, and your 
              car.  The sand is everything else-the small stuff.<br><br>"If you put 
              the sand into the jar first," he continued, "there is no room for the 
              pebbles or the golf balls.  The same goes for life. If you spend all 
              your time and energy on the small stuff, you will never have room for 
              the things that are important to you.<br><br>Pay attention to the things
               that are critical to your happiness.  Play with your children.  Take 
              time to get medical checkups.  Take your partner out to dinner.  Play 
              another 18 holes.  There will always be time to clean the house and fix 
              the disposal.  Take care of the golf balls first, the things that really
               matter.  Set your priorities.  The rest is just sand.<br><br>One of the
               students raised her hand and inquired what the coffee represented.  The
               professor smiled. "I'm glad you asked. It just goes to show you that no
               matter how full your life may seem, there's always room for a couple of
               cups of coffee with a friend."</p>
