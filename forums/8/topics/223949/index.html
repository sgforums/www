Plus the fact that the begger is poorer than you, it better to donate some.<br><br>As for bankok beggers, it is better not to cos once you donate, the rest beggers will come follow you and expect donations......</div>

Its quite shocking to see someone knocking one head against the floor only to realise he is only "shaking his head quickly". I am against his marketing tatics of "hurting" oneself to elicit sympathy.<br><br>i also didnt say keeping his earned money is bad, but i wanted to highlight his is actually very smart. He left 1 coin in the cup everytime he keeps the money. This show he has business sense as people would not donate to a cup that is full.<br><br>The reason i said he was fake because he gave me the first impression that he was really knocking against the floor. No one would know he is not knocking unless you stare and observe him from the sides.<br><br></div>
