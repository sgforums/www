U will probably end up in an old folk's home.... That is a foolish thing to do.<br><strong>DO u want to be married as a fool?</strong><br><br>My advice for u is:<br><br>1)lower yr expectations and go for a sincere average loyal guy who  has the same goals and ambitions as u do...leave SIngapore and make a better life migrating....Yr children will also be loyal to u as they carry his genes<br><strong>Dont be a fool in any way</strong><br><br><strong>Pissed off</strong>:<br><br>U god damned women, why dont u get it....U CANT BE LIKE THOSE RICH RICH ANG MOH driving limousines SO LONG U ARE LIVING HERE!!!!<br><br>1)U are meant to stay in HDB becos there is a serious lack of land here....<br>2) Cars are so ex cos there is a serious lack of roads here........<br><br>GET THAT IN YOUR PEA BRAIN LAH&gt;&gt;&gt;WAKE UP &gt;....U ARE NOT LIVING IN AUSSIE,SWISS..........WAKE UP HARD and what did yr school taught u?<br><br>TO think rite?......u sg women call yourselves "educated" poly/uni grads when u cant even think and analyse your surrounding, environment and people...<br><br>U want a car go buy yr own car...work for it...and dont leech on guys......What if the guys think the same as u...Want a gal wit the car? huh? what will happen to u.....<br><br>THINK THINK THINK....ENLARGE YR PEA BRAIN!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>I feel that it is not fair to blame the girls out there. Just let me start somewhere. Ther is a saying, one of my friend told me this,<br><br><strong>If a guy is rich or successful, he can choose how beautiful his wife or gf is.<br>If a gal is beautiful, she can choose how rich or successful her bf or husband is.<br>no doubt about, sad reality of life.</strong><br><br>I too have been told by my mum to study hard, don care about gf and in future girls will like me..<br>so imagine this idealogy has been there since i was only a few years old and maybe even in our parents' time.<br><br>one point is that the so call, "materialistic girls" usually belong to the above average looking type. one consolation point is that the ratio of beauties to the ratio of rich guys is higher, meaning there will be some left for us.<br><br>another point that i want to ask you is that don guys also go for more better looking girls?so that that means we have to be like you say be re-educated?go for all those that cant make it one? just admit it man. 90% of humans are superficial.</div>
