They are fine, upright people to be with but maybe a touch inhabited, need a little of the oomph factor. (X factor) Would not hestitate to be in the company of SG men. Don't be like a viper, one little brush and you start some serious hissing.  Here we go, another one of my jokes: can you imagine a world without men? no crimes and lots of happy fat women.</div>

Obviously he didnt mean the best of the best of the best in the world.  He meant "best from a group".  So supposing his mom hung out in a group of like 15 good friends and married on of them - he'd obviously be the "best".  "Best" is also subjective, so shut up.  Obviously your mom didnt hang out with very good company.<br><br>Imo, nature's instinct is to survive, not reproduce - granted reproduction is a part of survival - but not the whole picture.  Please feel free to start arguing about another un-related topic because its funny.<br><br>Natural selectivity obviously hasnt worked on you yet.

            <div class='col-md body'>im quite agree with u guys.. not only in singapore.. but most (if not all) women in  all other parts of asian countries are TOTALLY materialistic. Compared with last decades, in general the world is not as what happen it was compared to today.<br><br>The reasons are:<br>1. BRAINWASHED BY TV.. with those shows... reality TV shows or mushy fairy tales like in romantic movies featuring rich characters or celebrities... Women are very easily manipulated with these.... Did u guys n gals notice how good are business that sell products to women? cosmetics... expensive clothes... bags shoes etc etc.... because they think women are easily manipulated... with brainwashing medias (like TV showing rich celebrities) keep telling the world "beautiful girls will get rich husband and live 'happily ever after'....So what are they goin to do about this? Of course they try to be beautiful...and hunting Mr.Right for them (which means have to be rich). So guys... We enjoy watch Hollywood, Hongkong movies etc.. but without we realise... the world will keep changing and changing...<br><br>2. GIRLS WANT TO HAVE FUN. The beautiful they are.. the more spoiled they are... It's the TRUTH! Anybody Can't argue about this.... A gorgeous lady will prefer a slight (or quite) ugly businessman... rather than handsome and charming lorry driver (even though if both of them have the same educational background.. like college graduates). If it happens.. mostly becoz: he knows the guy very long (like maybe since secondary school), introduced by friends that "hey.. your bf is sooo kind... im jealous at u for having such a good guy" or she just have low self esteem and maybe got problems with dating since young.<br><br>3. GIRLS ARE GETTING SMARTER AND SMARTER NOWADAYS. Where is that "ethics in dating comes from?"... Where is that the norm come from which teach guys to be " a gentle men, have to act cool, have to open a door to women, have to kill spiders to impress her, to carry her shopping bags no matter how light is that" Of course these are from women!. They read books like "how to get rid of your boyfriend.. how to spot his flaws.. how to test him" while what guys read are about "cars, sports, sex, computer.. sex again"... Guys' world will be totally controlled by women in the near future!!!</div>
