              <p>Whatever your nationality, calling people of another nation 'Sillyporeans' does not make you less 'silly'. It does not make you seem any greater (not saying you meant to be anyway) and in fact reveals your immaturity in such name-calling. Besides, every literate person would notice that there is hardly a pun between Singaporeans and Si-lly-poreans. What limited vocabulary you've got. Try attending one of our many local schools. I suggest you visit one of Primary level. That is, for children aged 7 - 12 (in case you're not aware, given your scant knowledge and appreciation of our nation). English is certainly a core subject, but you could suggest to relevant authorities (The Ministry of Education) that we focus more on deliberately moving away from a particular spot and shifting chairs of other people during the allocated periods of Civics and Moral Education (CME, or you could also rename it to CUM if you wish).</p>
              <p>You would probably be far too old to attend Primary School, but I guess they'd make a deliberate exception since you wouldn't be able to enroll into secondary school. Immature people unable to think for themselves would join you. You could request for a switch to the now-defunct Woodbridge or IMH (FYI, Institute of Mental Health), you would feel more 'at home' there. It is certain.  </p>
