              <p>Is it you have to slowly go through all the stages from beginner to intermediate, than bronze, silver, gold, gold star and than take up lifeguard course before you can become a lifeguard?</p>

              <p>Thos are the swimming certificates. You do not need them to take up the lifeguard courses, but some instructors will prefer their students to have them.</p>
              <p>For the lifeguard courses, you must have a lifeguard instructor to teach you the techniques and the basics. You will start from life-saving 1, 2 and followed by 3, before you take up the bronze medallion. During my time, from the Bronze medallion, you will be able to take up the Patrol lifeguard or Pool lifeguard cert and become an official lifeguard.</p>

              <p>So according to this website i will have to first take up the Preliminary Module (PLM) of 10 sessions to get my Lifesavings 1, 2 and 3.</p>
              <p>Than I take the Standard Module(SDM) of 10 sessions to get bronze Medallion and Cardio-Pulimonary Resusciation.</p>
              <p>Than I take the Specialist Module(SCM) of 6 sessions to get my Pool Lifeguard certificate.</p>
              <p>After this 3 courses I will than qualify to be a lifeguard?</p>
              <p>There is no need to take the rest of the Advanced Module 1 and 2, Open water module 2 and 3, Coporate CPR, Senior Resusciation and Oxygen resusciation?</p>
              <p>Anyway, after I get the certificates to be a lifeguard will it be difficult for me to get a job as a lifeguard?</p>
              <p>I think Singapore should have a lack of lifeguards so it should not be a problem for me to be a lifeguard once I get all the necessary certificates right?</p>

              <p>The advanced certs are not a must for you to be a lifeguard. But you must have the bronze medallion, and volunteer yourself as a lifeguard for the Singapore LifeGuard Corps, before you can take the Pool Lifeguard Cert and be a full-time Lifeguard.</p>
              <p>There isn't really a lack of lifeguards, despite the fact that most lifeguards work as part-time lifeguards. All full-time lifeguards whom I know, especially my previous instructors and their friends, will give swimming/ lifeguards courses as another source of income.</p>
              <p>This may not hold true for private swimming pools' lifeguards, but you definitely need someone to introduce you for you to work in those areas.</p>
              <p>Anyway the modules thing are usually not followed, and the students would go for a lot more lessons and trainings than the minimum requirement. Just to let you know in case you are interested.</p>

              <p>The advanced certs are not a must for you to be a lifeguard. But you must have the bronze medallion, and volunteer yourself as a lifeguard for the Singapore LifeGuard Corps, before you can take the Pool Lifeguard Cert and be a full-time Lifeguard.</p>
              <p>There isn't really a lack of lifeguards, despite the fact that most lifeguards work as part-time lifeguards. All full-time lifeguards whom I know, especially my previous instructors and their friends, will give swimming/ lifeguards courses as another source of income.</p>
              <p>This may not hold true for private swimming pools' lifeguards, but you definitely need someone to introduce you for you to work in those areas.</p>
              <p>Anyway the modules thing are usually not followed, and the students would go for a lot more lessons and trainings than the minimum requirement. Just to let you know in case you are interested.</p>

              <p>So I must take Preliminary Module for my lifesavings 1, 2 and 3. Than take the Standard Module to get Bronze Medallion, Volunteer as a lifeguard for the Singapore lifeguard crops and finally take the Specialist Module to get my Pool Lifeguard Certificate than I can qualify as Lifeguard.</p>

              <p>That is correct.</p>
              <p>The pay rate depends a lot on where you are working, and whether you are working at public swimming pools or private swimming pools.</p>
              <p>For public pools, the part-time rate is only $7-15 per hour, and for full-time it is only slightly over $1k.</p>
              <p>For private pools, it can hit over $3k a month, but you will have to have connections to actually find someone to hire you, as most private pools depend on groups/companies like this :</p>

              <p>That website shows just one of the many companies in Singapore who provide lifeguard services to private pools. It is to show you that it won't be easy if you want to get a job at a private pool.</p>
              <p>If you want to be hired as a lifeguard at the public pools, the best way is to talk to your instructor. Ask him nicely and he will help you out. There is no point in trying to apply now since you do not have any life-saving cert yet.</p>
