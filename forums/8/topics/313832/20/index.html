              <p>School time and growing up during the 80's to 90's</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. You grew up watching He-man, MASK,Transformers, Silver hawk and Mickey Mouse. Not to forget, Ninja turtles, My Little Pony and Smurfs too.<br><br>2. You grew up brushing your teeth with a mug in Primary school during<br>recess time. You will squat by a drain with all your classmates beside<br>you, and brush your teeth with a coloured mug.The teachers said you must<br>brush each side 10 times too.<br><br>3. You know what SBC stands for.<br><br>4. You pay 40 cents for Chocolate or Strawberry MILK every week in class.<br><br>5. You watch a very popular Malay dubbed Japanese drama on RTM1 about<br>schoolgirls who possess powerful skills in volleyball called Meoro Attack.<br><br>6. You find your friends with pagers and handphone cool in Secondary<br>school.<br><br>7. SBS buses used to be non-airconditioned. The bus seats are made of wood<br>and the cushion is red. The big red bell gives a loud BEEEP! when pressed.<br>There are colourful tickets forTIBS buses.The conductor will check for<br>tickets by using a machine which punches a hole in the ticket.<br><br>8. Envelopes given to us to donate to Sharity Elephant every Children's<br>Day<br><br>9. You've probably read Young Generation magazine.You know who's Vinny the little vampire and Acai the constable.<br><br>10. You were there when they first introduced MRT here. You went for the<br>first ride with your parents and you would kneel on the seat to see the<br>scenery.<br><br>11. Movie tickets used to cost only $3.50.<br><br>12. Gals are fascinated by Strawberry Short Cake and Barbie Dolls.<br><br>13. You learn to laugh like The Count in Sesame Street.<br><br>14. You longed to buy tibits called Kaka(20 cents per pack),and Ding<br>Dang(50 cents per box), that had a toy in it and it changes every week not<br>forgetting the 15 cents animal crackers and the ring pop, where the<br>lollipop is the diamond on the ring.<br><br>15. You watched TV2(also known as Channel 10) cartoons because Channel 5<br>never had enough cartoons for you.<br><br>16. Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew, The Three Investigators, Famous Five and<br>Secret Seven are probably the thickest story books you ever thought you<br>have read. Even Sweet Valley High and Malory Towers.<br><br>17. KFC used to be a high class restaurant that serve food in plates and<br>let you use metal forks and knives.<br><br>18. The most vulgar thing you said was asshole and idiot and THE MOST<br>EXTREME WAS 'super white'...you just couldn't bring yourself to say the<br>hokkien relative.<br><br>19. Catching was the IN thing and twist as the magic word.<br><br>20. Your English workbooks was made of some damn poor quality paper that<br>was smooth and yellow.<br><br>21. CDIS were your bestfriend.<br><br>22. The only computer lessons in school involved funny pixellised<br>characters in 16 colours walking about trying to teach you maths.<br><br>23. Waterbottles were slinged around your neck and a must everywhere you<br>go.<br><br>24. Boys loved to play soccer with small plastic balls in the basketball<br>court.<br><br>25. Teng-teng, batu lesung, chapteh, hentam bola and zero point were all<br>the rage with the girls and boys too...<br><br>26. Science was fun with the balsam and the angsana being the most<br>important plants of our lives, guppies and swordtail being the most<br>important fish.<br><br>27. Who can forget Ahmad, Bala, Sumei and John, eternalized in our minds<br>from the textbooks. Even Mr Wally &amp; Mr. Yakki. What abt Miss Lala??? And<br>Zaki and Tini in Malay Textbooks?<br><br>28. We carry out experiments of our own to get ourself badges for being a<br>Young Zoologist/Botanist etc.<br><br>29. Every children's day and national day you either get pins or penswith<br>'HappyChildren's Day 1993' or dumbfiles with Happy National Day1994'.<br><br>30. In Primary six you had to play buddy for the younger kids like big<br>sister and brother.<br><br>31. We wear BM2000, BATA, or Pallas shoes.<br><br>32. Your form teacher taught you maths,science and english.<br><br>33. The worksheets were made of brown rough paper of poor quality.<br><br>34. You went to school in slippers and a raincoat when it rained, and you<br>find a dry spot in the school to sit down, dry your feet, and wear your<br>dry and warm socks and shoes.<br><br>35. School dismissal time was normally around 1 pm.<br><br>36. There would be spelling tests and mental sums to do almost everyday.<br><br>37. Your friends considered you lucky and rich if your parents gave you $3<br>or more for pocket money everyday.<br><br>38. You see Wee Kim Wee's face in the school hall.<br><br>39. You freak out when the teacher tells you to line up according to<br>height and hold hands with the corresponding boy or girl.<br><br>40. Boys like to catch fighting spiders.<br><br>41. Collecting and battling erasers was a pastime for boys<br><br>42. Autograph books were loaded with "Best Wishes", "Forget Me Not", and<br>small poems like "Bird fly high, hard to catch.Friend like you, hard to<br>forget".<br><br>43. Class monitors and prefects loved to say "You talk somemore, I write<br>your name ah!"<br><br>44. There were at least 40 people in one class.<br><br>45. Large, colourful schoolbags were carried.<br><br>46. You brought every single book to school, even though there was one<br>thing called the timetable.</p>

              <p>i remember all the kids would urinate in the samd, the cover...</p>
              <p>there was one afternoon me and my brother have nothing to do, so go down and dig a biggg hole infront of the slide, depth is around 1 4-5 yrs old child height, purposely choose that height.</p>
              <p>after digging, cover the surface with some newspaper, and watch the teacher from the nursery bring the 2-3 yrs old kids play playground, DAMn nice to see children falling in the hole.</p>
              <p>come to think of it, should have fill water, or cement...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>
