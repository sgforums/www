            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I met Lin, a thai at pattaya disco (golden mile).. I was 19 then and an awolist.. I worked part-time at the disco to earn some money for everyday needs and she was there working as a Fl.. Soon, I got to know her as days passed.. we click on pretty well and soon we are together..<br><br>Lin did not want to do overnight bookings because she wanted to wait for me after finishing work and go back together.(I was staying in her rented room at Gl).. that time, I honestly told her my situation, that I was on awol and could be arrested anytime.. I cant work full time and don't earn enough to feed the 2 of us.. She said she wouldn't care all these, she just want to be with me and will share all hardship together.. Lin was so young at that time, but her maturity really impressed me or should I say touched me..<br><br>One fine day, she was caught by the anti-vice and will be deported back in a week.. So both of us did not go to work and spend the remaining hours with each other, we talked about everything and the more I understand her, the more I begin to love her.. On the night before departure, she asked me what  I planned for the future? She did advised me to surrender to the army and she will wait for me to finish my national service.. If not, she told me to follow her back to Hatyai and stay with her.. I was in a dilemma and wish for some times to think about it.. She left me her address..<br><br>I sent her to the taxi as I am not able to see her off cause there will be officers around.. We hugged so close to each other before I bid her goodbye.. We both cried..<br><br>I move back home after that.. Got no mood to work anymore so I lied to my boss that I'll stopped work for awhile to settle some matters.. Weeks past, and I think of her day and night and yet I cant contact her(no phone)..  Mentally I am equally stressed as I am worried the military police might come for house arrest.. At that point of time, I made up my mind to flee the country, knowingly is risky as the checkpoint might had my awol records.. Being young, I decided to take the chance, without my family knowledge(except my younger sis), I packed some clothings, took my passport and gathered as much money as I could and  booked a bus ticket to Hatyai.. I went through the custom that faithful day...<br><br>After 18 hours of travel, I finally reached Hatyai in the early morning.. Got a tut-tut to take me to the address Lin gave me.. A lady answered the door, I show her the paper and she confirmed it's the right place.. I asked :"Lin Yu Mai?" She told me to wait while she go and call Lin down.. She came, she saw me and we were like lovers again...<br><br>In order to save cost, Lin suggested I stay in her room with her 3 room mates.. I was worried her friends might not be happy but to my surprise they are all very understanding and kind person.. Since that day, I changed my views on these working ladies.. The money I brought over was not much and soon drained up..<br><br>I told Lin about it but she assure me not to worry on it.. Lin and her mates are working as FLs daytime like the cat40 at Gl.. Every morning, after taking breakfast, she will send me to her uncle's fish farm to kill my time fishing there.. Around evening time, they will come and pick me back home for dinner.. During night, I will follow them to the disco and the girls will continue to work.. As usual, Lin wont take overnight bookings when I am around, so if she does not has any short-time customers, she will join me till the disco ends.. everyday was like a routine and I started to wonder : am I going to spend my life doing nothing and just live on Lin? never return to home again?<br><br>What can I do in Hatyai if I intended to stay on? I started to worry again and evantually I fell sick....very sick..... Lin thought I am not used to the living condition of the room(is not good), so without my knowledge she booked a hotel room and I moved in with her.. She has been paying for my lodging, foods, in fact everything since i was there.. I was thinking I need to do something, so I rang up my childhood friend and asked him to look for my dad that I need cash here..<br><br>My dad called me the following night and I explained to him my situation and he agreed to get the money to my friend and he will see me in Hatyai.. I told Lin about it as I could see she started to worried about the expenses too, but she just kept to herself.. Two days later, someone knocked on my room, Lin reached for the door and to my greatest shock I saw my mum and sis there!<br><br>Once inside, my mum started to leture on Lin, she thought I was cheated by her and she's the reason I awol and left home.. Lin did not uttered a word, she swallowed everythings thrown at her, she did not even defend for herself.. I was so fed-up that I retailated.. Told my mum off saying she's being too unreasonable, telling her that her precious son me would have been dead on the street of Hatyai if not for this lady..<br><br>We cool off gradually and I took the chance to tell her more of what Lin has done for me... My mum was so touched after hearing it, she told me honestly she never expect a working lady would have done these, thought she was cheating me that's why I called home to ask for the few grand.. Finally, all mis-understanding cleared but then their turn to gang-up against me.. After discussion on my matters, I agreed to my mum to go back and surrendered to the army and complete my NS.. But I requested my mum to let me stay for few more days and she agreed..<br><br>Lin get along well with my mum and sis and we visited many interesting places.. We are so happy everyday.. No worries finally.. The night before we returned home, my mum took out 3k(Sin) and passed to Lin.. As a appreciation for Lin for taking care of my needs during my 3 months stay there.. She insisted she don't want the money and tell my mum to use it on me.. I persuaded her but she was just too stubborn.. I then write Lin my house no. and told her to call my mum or sis if she needs anything when I am not around.. She only had one request:"I just want you to come back &amp; look for me". My heart sanked... We cried to sleep that night..<br><br>The day to leave, that morning her mates joined us for breakfast together.. We then waited at the hotel lobby for our airport taxi.. Then Lin came to me, she hold my hand tightly and tell me she cant send me off at the airport.. She said she got a very important matters to attend to.. She give me a kiss and bid my family goodbye and she left.. I was wondering what the hell was it? Is there anything more important? I was sad... One of her mates send us to the departure hall, we exchange well wishes and I beg her to take good care of Lin..<br><br>Then her friend told me this:"Lin got nothing on at all, she just could not take it to leave u &amp; see u off, and she's afraid I might changed my mind to go back if I see her broke-down.. And she has promised my mum something(till today, I don't know what is it.).. My eyes turned red as I board the plane....<br><br>I was sentenced for 11mths in detention barracks.. To live in a closed-up cell is not as bad as I've thought, but to think of Lin everyday is very torturing, I have countless sleepless nights..  I always asked my mum during parent's visiting day whether did Lin called? But my mum say she did not and asked me to forget her.. I was wondering why.....till date.. After my released, we shifted house and I continue to serve my NS for another year till ROD.. I kept asking my mum did she say anything to Lin but she insisted she never..<br><br>I went Hatyai and look for her, my friend who I called last time accompany me there.. We went, but the room we used to stay in was emptied.. we went to several places I used to go but all to no avail... since then, I never get to see Lin again...<br><br>Well, it's been over 10yrs now and at times I still think of her.. Not hoping to be back with her honestly as I am married now.. Just want to know she is living well and she's safe &amp; sound.. I just want to tell her:<br><br>Lin, thank you..<br></div>
