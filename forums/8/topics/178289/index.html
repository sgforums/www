            <div class='col-md body'>From Discovery Channel webby<br><br><strong>DRAGONS: A FANTASY MADE REAL imagines dragons as real animals. Using stunning computer-generated imagery from the same graphics company that made creatures for Walking with Dinosaurs and Walking with Prehistoric Beasts, as well as the Harry Potter films, viewers see dragons from the inside out. The special imagines how dragons would have evolved into a number of different species through the ages and around the globe, and how each dragon species was endowed with physical adaptations and behaviors specialized for its environment. In this story, dragons find a mate, raise young, protect their territory and struggle to survive human encroachment, just as animals have done throughout history</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.bugsincyberspace.com/bupmate2.jpg"><br><br>The ability of this species to defend itself with a particularly odiferous secretion was reported as early as 1835, when Gray in describing the genus quoted an account by Thomas Say "...that when taken they discharged a milky fluid from two pores of the thorax, diffusing a strong odor..." Albert (1947) also described it as a "...rather thick, tenacious white material..." Blatchley (1920) described it as having "...a peculiar, though somewhat pleasing odor, which has been likened to that of the common everlasting, Gnaphalium obtusifolium L." MacAtee (191<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> reported a second hand report "...that Anisomorpha buprestoides discharges a vapor from the end of the abdomen and that the discharge is preceded by a peculiar crepidation..." He noted, correctly, that this report differs from almost all others.<br><br>Eisner (1965) reported, "The secretion is produced and stored in two elongate, sac-like glands situated in the thorax and opening just behind the head." Happ et al. (1966) presented detailed information on the structure of the glands. The glands open in notches at the anterolateral angles of the pronotum (Littig 1942). The glands are functional from birth and Eisner (1965) reported newly-hatched nymphs successfully repelling attacks by single ants. Meinwald et al. (1962) identified the active ingredient as a terpene dialdehyde related to catnip and named it anisomorphal.<br><br>pronotal gland<br><br>Eisner (1965) reported that the stick insects generally discharged the secretion as a result of certain perceived threats. They can aim up to 30 to 40 cm with accuracy: "Anisomorpha discharges instantly in response to mild traumatic stimulation as, for example, when individual legs are pinched with forceps, or when the body is tapped or persistently prodded . . . Marksmanship is precise: the spray invariably drenches the particular instrument used for stimulation." Although most discharges required actual physical contact, Eisner (1965) found that the stick insects often would discharge at birds before being contacted by the bird. In trials, Eisner (1965) found the secretion to be an effective defense against ants, beetles, mice and birds; mouse- opossums (Marmosa sp.), however, managed to withstand the spray and consume the stick insect once its reservoir was depleted after up to five discharges from the larger females. One to two weeks are required to replenish the depleted reservoirs (Eisner 1965). Carlberg (1985) found that rats (Rattus norvegicus (Berkenhout)) initially were repelled, but some individuals managed to overcome the defense in subsequent attacks.</div>

They existed from the late Triassic to the end of the Cretaceous period (228 to 65 million years ago). Pterosaurs were the first vertebrates to evolve flight. Their wings were formed by a sophisticated membrane of skin stretching from the torso to a dramatically lengthened fourth finger. Earlier species had long, fully-toothed jaws and long tails, while later forms had a highly reduced tail, and some lacked teeth. Most pterosaurs were moderate sized, but some reached very large sizes.It is believed that competition with early bird species may have resulted in the extinction of the pterosaurs. By the end of the Cretaceous, only large species of pterosaurs survived. The smaller species were extinct, and replaced by birds. At the end of the Cretaceous period, the larger animals all died, including the pterosaurs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i strongly believe dragons are dinosaurs (pterosaurs flying reptiles) or their fossils and nothing else. people in the past like to make up stories..<br>if u do a search u will find many reports from people seeing strange huge birds spottted flying in the sky over Texas &amp;  Illinois<br>which look like pterosaurus in the last 50 years:, think one encounter was with miners who saw something huge fly out from the underground into the sky ... they call it the "thunderbird sightings"</div>
