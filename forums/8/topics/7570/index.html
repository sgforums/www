Everything is over.  If I was to regret later on, I will make the move to call the guy up and explain, but then again...it all depends; on the situation and the relationship of the girl and the boy.<br><br>But then again...girls are girls...and we girls like guys with thick-skinned.  Some will want the guy to give her more attention and affection.  It all depends on the stiutuation and the girl.<br><br>Snafu:  I love your reply!!!!!!

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe because we are stronger than girls,so when we slap a girl,we could end up injuring her physically in addition to their loss of pride while guys who get slapped by a girl,the most they lose is their pride and ego only mah,so that's why i never approve of guy slapping girl,but scolding is a different matter altogether  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">))</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>call me a relic from the dinosaur age, but i think guys should never hit a gal no matter what the provocation, within limits of course. i do know that some gals can be very one kind, but sometimes guys do not know their own strength and can hurt a gal badly if he slaps or attack her.<br><br>i also very one kind, i do tend to provoke guys whom i like very much sometimes (may once, twice or thrice max) to see if they're potentially physically abusive. no point getting hitched to a potential abusive man. i've a friend who broke off with a guy whom i thought was a good guy the few times i met him, i even tried counselling her about reconciling with him every time i had a chance until she finally told me off and let on that he hits her!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> slapped her and a bit more. agreed with her decision and advised her stick to her decision to leave him post haste because i believe physically abusive people seldom change.<br><br>i hope i'll have the strength to give the man of my life the boot should he ever get physically abusive even if we are married, such people seldom change, they can only get worse.<br><br>[This message has been edited by colette (edited 28 May 2000).]</div>
