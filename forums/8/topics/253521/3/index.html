            <div class='col-md body'>I'm glad you started this thread coz i just happen to be an expert of zombie survival.<br><br>First thing you do is assess the nature of the outbreak. Consider things such as the amount of zombies loose, the concentration of zombies in the area, and whether or not the nation is doing anything about it.<br><br>Once you have considered those factors, look for an appropriate place to barricade yourself in, or, if your area if the outbreak in your area is too severe, you may need to move to a safer location. One of the most important things you have to remember is safety in numbers. Stick with your friends, family, and pretty much whoever isn't a zombie. However, picking some random to stick with may not always be a good idea as that person might backstab you to save himself/herself so try to get people fairly trustworthy.<br><br>Next step is to find yourself some supplies, if your chosen area you wish to barricade is a convenience store of some sort, which I highly recommend, then supplies wouldn't be much of a problem. But, if it's not, you'll need to look for such items as bean bags to pile, wire (preferably barbed), canned food (those that don't require cooking may be a good idea), a supply of clean drinking water if you don't already have access to it, a radio or portable TV and things most people tend to forget: batteries and a can opener. Anything else you might find in a hardware store could be useful. Be creative.<br><br>Depending on your situation, you may want to perform this step before the previous one but I'll leave that for you to judge. Considering it's relatively hard to find firearms in Singapore, I highly recommend long, heavy, blunt objects to use as weapons. A perfect example is a golf club or bat. Knives are no good as you'll have to get in close to a zombie to kill it and getting close to a zombie is not a good idea as they could easily bite you and pass on the infection. When in combat with one of the undead, remember to aim for the head as the only way to destroy a zombie is to damage the brain. A few bashes to the head with a golf club would easily do the trick. If you think you've killed a zombie but it's brain is still intact, don't be fooled as you have only incapacitated it for a limited period of time. To be absolutely safe, destro its brain even if it's lying on the ground seemingly dead. But remember, only use your weapon as a last resort. Zombies are extremely slow and it's always better to run away than to fight. Do not engage in close combat unless absolutely necessary i.e. you're surroundered or cornered.<br><br>After barricading your chosen area, be sure to leave your radio or TV on because at any time information crucial to your survival could be broadcast. If lack of batteries or power is an issue, turn your radio or TV on for an allocated amount of time at regular intervals. If you need to leave your safety shelter for any reason, never do so alone. It is crucial that somebody else knows where you are at any point in time and that you're with at least one other person. Another important thing you need to remember is DO NOT GO OUT AT NIGHT unless of course it is absolutely necessary. This is a very common and possibly very fatal mistake. Zombies are far more active at night than in broad sunlight. All activities whatever they may be should be done during the daytime. Also, if you're going to be travelling a fair distance away from your zombie shelter, be sure to bring some supplies with you as you might not be able to make it back before the sun sets and if that is the case then you should start seeking a temporary shelter for the night at least an hour before the sun goes down.<br><br>If you have any further questions please post them and I'll gladly share some survival tips with you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just watched 28 weeks later.. Damn I think it bloody rox.. (pun intended) But the zombies in this movie is helluva freaking fast.. I think there's gonna be a part 3.. "28 years later" maybe? spoilers ---&gt;<span style="color: white;">The ending shows that the infection has spread to Paris.</span><br><br>I think if zombie in SG cannot hide already.. Too small, zombies too fast. Must fight them. Get some thick clothings or hard clothings.. So won't easily bitten I guess.. Travel by water.. Hide in the middle of sea... Zombies can't swim eh? Lol unless zombie shark come attack me..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In the event of an international zombie outbreak, we are dead meat. Consider this:<br><br>(1) Singapore is an island without natural resources, we cannot quarantine ourselves from the rest of the world without causing mass starvation.<br><br>(2) By not closing our borders (i.e. shut airport and seaports....and also barricade off the Causeway), the chances of an infected person slipping thru' are very high.<br><br>(3) Should even 1 infected person slip thru', the consequences will be very severe due to Singapore being the most densely populated country in the world......and as any epidemiologist will tell you, diseases spread best in dense populations, especially urban ones like S'pore. All it takes is that 1 zombie to bite another, and the 2nd victim to bite another, then the 3rd biting more and so forth....increasing their numbers exponentially.......<br><br>(4) Citizens have no access to firearms to protect themselves. Worst way to deal with zombies is by close combat......an ax or knife is difficult to use against someone who is only vulnerable to brain trauma (you cannot kill a zombie by whacking other parts of his body), plus you have to prevent bites.<br><br>(5) Our police and soldiers are not well trained to deal with the type of threat zombies can pose. Read the "Zombie Survival Guide" and "World War Z" by Max Brooks for more on this issue. I got my copies at Borders bookshop.<br><br></div>
