              <p>Raffles Hotel, one of the icons of Singapore, which had won so many awards, overseas as well as locally, and a hotel that Singaporeans are supposed to be proud of. But I was absolutely disappointed on my visit there today. My friends and I were chilling out at the open section of LongBar when we saw a bat caught in the net that is placed on the hotel's exterior! It was a real surprise to all of us. A closer look and we realise that the bad has somehow got its wings entangled in the net. It struggled hard to escape but its wings were totally binded by the net. My friends and I pointed this out to the bar's waiter in the hope that the waiter can free the bat. However, we were again surprised at the waiter's response.</p>
              <p>"That's what the net is supposed to be for," he said with a grin.</p>
              <p>Overwhelmed with disbelief, we tried to borrow a pair of scissors so that we can cut away the net around the bat. However, we were stopped by a waitress who said that the housekeeping section will take care of the matter. We trusted that a reputable hotel like that will not fail us. However, for the rest of the 45 minutes we were there, there was no one to attend to the bad.</p>
              <p>A few others tried to cut the net using a nailclipper that brought with them, but were unfortunately stopped by the waitress and assured that the housekeeping section is coming to attend to the matter.</p>
              <p>We were extremely disappointed at how poorly the management has dealt with this matter in several aspects. Firstly, the bat must have been caught in a torn net to have been entangled in the net. Secondly, I would like to believe that the hotel's intention is to deter the bats from flying too low and as such disrupt the guests and not to capture the bats. Thirdly, to achieve the goal of deterrence, I thought that the hotel would have chosen nets with smaller holes so that the bats will just bump into the net, rather to be entangled in the net. Lastly, the management did not respond to the matter quickly and the poor bat might have died from the ordeal due to their slow response.</p>
              <p>I feel absolutely ashamed that the hotel is so closely associated with the country.</p>

Raffles hotel didnt win any Animal rights award, what they are recognized were for the excellent customer service and the highest standards they provide for visiting patrons, not for visiting Bats. if it's a customer, it will blemish their reputation , however, a bat being caught in the net is due to the bat's fault or if u want to put it  that way, it's the net's fault. Come on  la , why is that just because the *waiters* failed to untangle the net to free the bat, you 're already lambasting the whole of the Raffles Hotel management? </p></div>
