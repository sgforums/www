              <p>Police have arrested a 22-year-old female student who is
              involved in several cases of Forgery of Medical Certificates.
               </p>
              <p>It is believe the suspect had sold forged Medical Certificates
              to other students, who in turn submitted them to their respective
              schools to skip classes. The students had contacted the suspect
              through social media and subsequently arranged to meet up with the
              suspect to purchase the forged Medical Certificates (MCs), which
              had the letterheads of legitimate clinics fraudulently printed on
              them. The forged MCs were detected when the teacher of the school
              in the east became suspicious and verified the students’ medical
              records with the respective clinics, which then exposed the ruse. A
              police report was then lodged.</p>
              <p>Through protracted investigations and extensive follow-up,
              officers from Ang Mo Kio Police Division managed to establish the
              identity of the suspect who sold the MCs to the students. On 22 May
              2013 at about 10.30 pm , the suspect was arrested in the vicinity
              of Ang Mo Kio Avenue 9. A stack of forged MCs was also found at the
              suspect’s house and seized as case exhibit. Preliminary
              investigations revealed that the suspect had sold the forged MCs to
              at least 30 students between March 2013 and May 2013.</p>
              <p><strong>Investigations against the suspect as well as the
              students involved are on-going. The offence of Forgery for the
              Purpose of Cheating under Section 468 of the Penal Code Chapter
              224, carries a maximum jail term of up to 10 years’ imprisonment,
              and shall also be liable to fine.</strong></p>
              <p>Commander of Ang Mo Kio Police Division, Deputy Assistant
              Commissioner of Police (DAC) Keok Tong San, commended his officers
              for their good investigation which resulted in the arrest of the
              suspect and protected the integrity of the affected clinics.
              <strong>He also cautioned that forging Medical Certificates in
              order to skip school or work is tantamount to a criminal offence
              and the Police will not hesitate to take such persons to
              task.</strong></p>

              <h1>ICA officer jailed for forging medical certificates</h1>
              <p>An Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officer was sentenced 
              to four months' jail on Friday for forging medical certificates.</p>
              <p>Mohammad Saqib Mohd Ghalib, 34, a staff sergeant, had admitted to 
              five charges of fraudulently making the MCs issued by Kao &amp; Tan 
              Family Medical Centre &amp; Surgery by cancelling the period of his MCs 
              and altering the dates without lawful authority.</p>
              <p>He committed the offences at Telok Blangah Post Office between December 2010 and March last year.</p>
              <p>A district court heard that Sadiq, attached to the Woodlands 
              checkpoint for the last seven years, would tell the doctors at the 
              clinic that they would need to stamp and sign on the MC three times so 
              that his office would believe that it was genuine.</p>

              <p><strong>Woman investigated for filing false police report to cover work absence</strong><span class="date"> <br><em>10 Oct 2013</em></span><em><span> | </span><span class="author">By Channel NewsAsia</span></em></p>
              <p>Police are investigating a woman who is believed to have lodged a 
              false police report of snatch theft to cover up her absence from work.</p>
              <p>Her boyfriend, who is believed to have instigated her into filing the report, is also being investigated.</p>
              <p>In a statement, police said the woman, 22, lodged the report on October 9 at about 11.25am.</p>
              <p>She
               reported that an unknown dark-skinned man riding a bicycle had snatched
               her handbag at about 6.15am that day at Sembawang Drive.</p>
              <p>She claimed her bag contained an EZ-Link card and personal items.</p>
              <p>Police
               said they investigated the case, and established that the woman had 
              made a false report on the instigation of her 27-year-old boyfriend.</p>
              <p>She had apparently used up her leave entitlement, and lodged the report as an excuse to be absent from work.</p>
              <p>Police said investigations against the couple are on-going.</p>
              <p>They
               warned that anyone convicted of filing a false report or abetting to 
              such an offence can be jailed up to a year and fined up to S$5000.  -
