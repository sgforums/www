            <div class='col-md body'>You all do not bluff me, LittleMan. I have been in the industry for years, and there is no way you can convince me that B2C ecommerce is going to take off the way you erroneously envision.<br><br>The fact is, all your crooning about wider access to a wider public makes sense, but you made that comment without considering a very important factor - cultural and social barrier. People are not used to buy stuff over the Net. Besides most people prefer to visit shopping malls to view and feel the stuff by hand before buying it. The legal constraints to overcome is a big hurdle to B2C ecommerce.<br><br>And in case you do not know, all those crap Ecommerce companies that you are talking about are ALL losing money, with the exception of Pornographic related ecommerce companies, which is making a huge profit.<br><br>Ecommerce ideas have already been started in Singapore for a long time, but an important question has to be asked, why is it not taking off? Do you people even know about <a href="http://www.shoppingvillage.com.sg?" rel="nofollow">www.shoppingvillage.com.sg?</a><br><br>If however, you are talking about B2B Ecommerce, I will bet my last underwear that it is definitely going to take off.<br><br>B2C Ecommerce, sorry pal, it still has a long way, after overcoming all the political, financial, banking, operational, marketing, cultural and societal hurdles then you come and talk to me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>before any retort, I will only accept hardcore numbers.

            <div class='col-md body'>ngkaihoe:<br><br>I agree with your posting on B2B.  That will boom.<br><br>Your comments refer to just Singapore or do they refer to the entire B2C industry in this world?<br><br>If you're just referring to Singapore, then I agree with you that it'll be slower to take off in Singapore and the region for the reasons which you mentioned.  But I see no impediment for future growth.<br><br>If you're referring to the West, eg USA, then are u also predicting that all the B2C companies will collapse soon and that consumers will reject B2C and continue to happily shop in traditional stores?  You think that B2C has no future??<br><br>Unfortunately I've not been reading much lately on hard facts and figures.  But in case you want to know what i've been reading, try<br><br>'Information Rules' by Carl Shapiro and Hal Varian (1998 Havard Uni Press); wealth of examples;  and for more technical current stuff try the bank of england website which churns out current research regarding anticipated effects of the Internet on Britain and the West.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>By having business moves it entire supply chain over on the net, it really does speed up trading times.. BtoB is a tradition business convention on a newmedia.<br><br>Companies providing application services and infrastructure for this interaction to take place will grow and prospere...<br><br>But then again, trying to speed up your development and drifting away from basic system development concepts, and trying to bring exponential growth by driving up your revenue instead of PROFITS and you might just fall back to where online retail is now.<br><br>Oh yes..given a correct approach, it will grow. And its something entirly different from online retail...which will never grow, even if its given a correct approach (personalization, content, blah blah)<br><br>The intended message goes out to those who might be starting a dot.com, or joining one now.. think carefully.. or YOU might be the next layoff.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I personally am in the trade too, for years, may I add.<br><br>I am not saying that B2C ecommerce is going to die off. The time is not ripe for B2C Ecommerce yet. The infrastructure is not there for it to flourish like nobody's business.<br><br>The step before B2C ecommerce booming will be after WAP becomes more mature, and legislation allows it to boom.<br><br>B2C will boom, but not until 4-5 years from now. And anyone who thinks of going into B2C Ecommerce business thinking of earning big bucks, go and fly kite. All ecommerce companies I know now are losing money like nothing. That is a fact, and as you say, ignorance is bliss.<br><br>And please do not look at the turnover of Ecommerce alone, 85 billion looking front the grandscale of design is nothing. Besides for every sales they make now, they are losing money. You are actually being paid to use Ecommerce services. How long can this go?<br><br>On the other hand B2B ecommerce is all set to take off. All barriers to B2B ecommerce are gone. This will take off before B2C Ecommerce.<br><br>So guys and gals, do not try to act smart, soylent and littleman are probably students who know nuts about the industry. Notice why people in the industry has lesser hopes on B2C Ecommerce? They know what is involved. Soylent and littleman do not.</div>
