              <p>LOVE?   Based on a post <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQJVSOh7cEc">here</a></p>
              <p>In the old days, people says that as long as there is love everything is possible.  But when one look at the divorce rates, money was one of the reason why a couple heads different direction.</p>
              <p>I always feel that there's nothing wrong for a woman to leave a husband who's a loafer that expects his wife to bring home the bacon.  The only exception is when he was once a breadwinner who was disabled by an accident.  What's your view on the case of a woman leaving her disabled husband who was once the breadwinner to fend for herself?</p>
              <p>Love just can't fill hungry stomachs.</p>

              <p>well, people are nurtured thru the society upbringing, if the society is a money minded one, then we cannot blame the people, naturally they were taught to the need of money, so the value system need to be alter inorder for people to deviate from money and concentrate more on love and relationship which in the first place do not and should not involve money.</p>

              <p><br>Well society is a very big word. Is it about immediate society or society at large?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I agree that values make a very large part about how people view money. However, how do we actually get our values? you and me, and stooky all belong to the same society. But I believe if we were to place what are the most important values we have - we may place certain core values in very different positions, including where money stands in our grand scheme of things.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That's not BAD - we need people who think about money a lot to make our economy work so that the rest of the people can think about money less and just work for the economy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think it is very much about... exposure and opportunity too. If a person had been given the opportunity to learn that happiness can be gained through other important factors beyond money. Some people never have a chance to experience this, and eventually it is far more difficult for them to understand how to achieve self fulfillment using other routes.</p>

              <p>that would really depend on what is your take on the definition of a "job"</p>
              <p>to you, a job maybe is something for you to earn some money so that you can live.</p>
              <p>for me, a job is something for me to earn money, to live and provide my future family with the basic level of needs and fulfil some level of wants.</p>
              <p>quite simply put it, in singapore, we are considered better off, in the material aspects of living, as compared to other asean countries, where there are people surviving with USD $1 or USD $2 a day. even if you are willing to give up the PC that allows you to surf sgforums, or the television that brings you the news from all over the world, having USD$1 can hardly fetch you anything in Singapore, maybe just a packet of toufu. Compared to the lesser economically well off country where USD$1 can be a basket of food for the daily needs.</p>
              <p>so, to me, if the basic needs are not even met, it's almost impossible for me to fufil my level of wants.</p>

              <p>that would really depend on what is your take on the definition of a "job"</p>
              <p>to you, a job maybe is something for you to earn some money so that you can live.</p>
              <p>for me, a job is something for me to earn money, to live and provide my future family with the basic level of needs and fulfil some level of wants.</p>
              <p>quite simply put it, in singapore, we are considered better off, in the material aspects of living, as compared to other asean countries, where there are people surviving with USD $1 or USD $2 a day. even if you are willing to give up the PC that allows you to surf sgforums, or the television that brings you the news from all over the world, having USD$1 can hardly fetch you anything in Singapore, maybe just a packet of toufu. Compared to the lesser economically well off country where USD$1 can be a basket of food for the daily needs.</p>
              <p>so, to me, if the basic needs are not even met, it's almost impossible for me to fufil my level of wants.</p>

              <p><br>actually... err.. i think both of you are saying the same thing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Essentially a job is for you to make money so that money can be used to get what you feel you NEED and a reasonable level of wants.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It isn't MONEY itself that you are pursuing but rather the benefits of having some money which is essential and is a tool to maintaining a reasonable living standard.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course the big question is - for some people a simple CRT TV means they already fulfil their want of watching TV and for others, they are not happy without a Plasma TV.</p>

              <p>yeah.. and if those are met by your job, do you need to strive for a bigger car, a bigger house, more stuff to throw into your house, a bigger screen TV, a more powerful computer.. all those things?</p>
              <p>again, if the needs are met, and a few luxuries can be afforded, why do people want to strive and work so hard for more?</p>
              <p>and at what price?</p>
              <p>i've seen people work so hard "to provide for their family" that they never see their family and eventually, that family breaks down because they are not around.. and another whom i don't think has a life outside work.. he arrives at 7:15am every day and leaves the office at 9 or 10 every day... sometimes he turns up during the weekends... he monitors everything... calls people at ungodly hours to get status (my organisation has shift workers)..</p>
              <p>he has a daughter.. i wager the daughter would not know who he is because he's always in the office...</p>
              <p>now.. that's they thing i was talking about...</p>
              <p>do your work.. put in your hours.. collect your wages and use them as a tool..</p>
              <p>money is not and should never be the goal of life...</p>
              <p>i had a little badge once which said "Money is how people with no talent keep score"</p>
              <p>i should have changed it to "Money is how people with no life keep score"</p>
              <p>but if you want to strive for your family, it's a good thing.. just don't overdo it.. most children would rather their parents be with them sharing a good time than a missing parent throwing money at the child...</p>

              <p>Well, it simply doesn't make sense to compare two extremes.</p>
              <p>Obviously, no one can survive without money, but the key to the debate, in my opinion, is how much emphasis we should place on money (or love) in a relationship.</p>
              <p>In today's context, when a person is willing to give up a high-paying job for the love of his life - be it a man/woman or simply a passion like music, he or she would have already proven that he values "love" more than "materialistic assets".</p>

              <p>At the end of it, all boils down to each individual's feeling and views about money, whether is money a slave or a God.  But then, we still need it to live in a world that is driven by it.</p>

              <p>I don't think man can survive solely based on the idea that "love conquers all". Starting a family is dependent on many factors such as having basic security. Basic needs ought be fufilled for survival.However, I don't think you needs lot of money for happiness. Contentment does not derived from lots of wants.</p>
              <p>I do believe the types of values that one accepted will influence the path one will tread on. If you think money is god, most likely you become a slave to this god.</p>
              <p>It's might be a misconception that most of the successful entrepeneurs work for the love of money. While infact most of them had mentioned in their books that they are working for things that they had believed in, things that will make a difference, for the passion of it, in short, for many other reasons. Love of money is just some way below in their ranking. They are, in the sense highly-evolved beings who know how to utilize the money tool.</p>

              <p>In the olden days, it may b possible to survive mainly on love (minus the fact tat humans need food + water + air + [sex &lt;-- optional] ). </p>
              <p>Look at the world now...how different it is now compared to then, i shall not comment as all can see. </p>
              <p>So, sad to say, love may not be everything now...money is.  Love is neccessary to nuture a human tho'. </p>
