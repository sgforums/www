Yet, they are alarmed by tests that are finding acrylamide in hundreds of cooked foods - from bread and potato chips to almonds and coffee.<br><br>The dilemma is heightened in California, where voter-approved Proposition 65 is supposed to trigger public notices on substances 'known to the state to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm'.<br><br>State officials deemed acrylamide such a substance in 1990, long before it was found in food. It was then known mainly as a chemical useful in treating sewage water.<br><br>California scientists are now reassessing its risks. The Attorney-General's Office has urged caution, saying too little is known.<br><br>Nonetheless, private lawyers have filed a flurry of lawsuits, alleging that food vendors from McDonald's and Burger King to KFC and Wendy's should be warning the public about acrylamide.<br><br>If the lawyers prevail, California could end up with warnings in countless restaurants and grocery stores saying that french fries and other foods with acrylamide might cause cancer.<br><br>'You know the thick paper containers in which they give you fries over the counter, where McDonald's has the arches and the pictures of Ronald McDonald? To me, the warnings should be right there,' said Mr Raphael Metzger, a Long Beach, California, lawyer who is suing McDo- nald's and Burger King.<br><br>The lawsuit is pending in the California Superior Court.<br><br>Since the discovery of acrylamide in food two years ago, researchers around the world have detected it in dozens of foods.<br><br>By some estimates, it might be present in as much as 40 per cent of the food people eat.<br><br>But it is particularly prevalent in starchy foods such as potato chips and french fries, which are so popular that the average American gulps down about 13kg a year.<br><br><span style="color: red;">The simple act of cooking, scientists have found, causes acrylamide to develop naturally in carbohydrate-rich foods.<br><br>Frying, baking, roasting or otherwise cooking at high temperatures releases the organic chemical.</span><br><br>California officials say some warnings might be inevitable. 'We are trying to move responsibly, but we have to work within the requirements of this law,' said Ms Joan Denton, director of California's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment.<br><br>'Some businesses that have acrylamide in their food may be required to notify customers.'<br><br>Proposition 65 is the reason California has so many warning signs - in bars, hotels and parking garages, in the packaging of products such as video game joysticks and fishing rods - that advise of possible cancer risks.<br><br>The many critics of Proposition 65 predict that the pending decision on acrylamide will finally make a mockery of environmental health labelling, resulting in warnings so common they will be meaningless.<br><br>To make that point, a sceptics' organisation, the American Council on Science and Health, announced plans to sue Whole Foods Market, saying the supermarket chain should post warnings because some of the organic bread it sells contains acrylamide. <span style="font-style: italic;">\-- Los Angeles Times </span></blockquote>So how, what's your take? With all the increased warnings that come with the advancement of science, are you going to heed the warnings and become more selective of what you eat? Or are you just gonna go ahead and eat like you used to?<br><br>I think I'll just continue with the way I ate. My ancestors ate the way I did, and nope, they didn't have an exceptionally high rate of diseases. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
