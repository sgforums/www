            <div class='col-md body'>sigh these people are quite spas. i mean if u can't afford it then don't go overseas. if u can't make it to uni here, there are always many other different ways and means to go about doing things. going overseas is not the only way. unless of course your mom has a spare 100k to give then its ok. if not than don't. plus the added fact that the economy is really very bad now... i suggest you ask your mom to think it through very well.</div>
