              <p>Speaking of guys pretending to be girls, you seem to have the most potential.</p>
              <p>Troll you lack imagination, try harder.</p>
              <p>In fact, I pity you. You seem to think that any girl with male friends is prostituting herself. Maybe being a loner has really screwed up your mind. Do you even have any friends? Do you know what it's like to have a friend?</p>

              <p><br>Not to worry. I have lots of friends in real life. I do not need to flirt/seduce desperados in forums to make friends.</p>
              <p>Now, if you had used another nick that shows that you are a guy, I wonder if you are going to get all these 'friends'. These 'friends' of yours are just anonymous opportunist sex predator looking for free sex.</p>
              <p>But I think they will get a shock when the big day comes. They are going to realise that a 'woman' whom they have fantasised and yearned so much is actually a tranny in disguise.</p>
              <p>But not to worry, like what parn said, you can just lie that you are putting a banana in a panty to scare off the rapist. Let's just hope that those guys would continue to be conned by you  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png">  </p>

              <p>Or if you're really in a hurry then just simply flash a smile and tell them you really have no idea, definitely beats just walking away like that.</p>
