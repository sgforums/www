              <p>I am a driver and pedestrian myself, I have crossed zebra crossings as a driver and pedestrian alike. It is common sense to slow down at zebra crossings as pedestrians have right of way. I have met my fair share of inconsiderate drivers who zoom by crossings and nearly knocking pedestrians down. However the bad eggs make up like 3/10 encounters. Hence, as a driver, you should slow down approaching zebra crossings, and as a pedestrian, check traffic before crossing.</p>
              <p>Being a driver, as much as I do not like being obstructed by unforeseen circumstances at traffic lights even when they turn green. I am still obliged to wait till it clears or manuever away from it as possible. I might honk from impatience, but I will not resort to knocking pedestrians off the road to get my way.</p>
              <p>No, I do not drive a benz nor have obscene amounts of money or a regular attorney at my disposal as my time is more precious dealing with more important things in life than pedestrians being held up in the middle of the road's traffic lights and needing to knock them off their feet.</p>

However the bad eggs make up like 3/10 encounters. Hence, as a driver, you should slow down approaching zebra crossings, and as a pedestrian, check traffic before crossing.</p>
              <p>Being a driver, as much as I do not like being obstructed by unforeseen circumstances at traffic lights even when they turn green. I am still obliged to wait till it clears or manuever away from it as possible. I might honk from impatience, but I will not resort to knocking pedestrians off the road to get my way.</p>
              <p>No, I do not drive a benz nor have obscene amounts of money or a regular attorney at my disposal as my time is more precious dealing with more important things in life than pedestrians being held up in the middle of the road's traffic lights and needing to knock them off their feet.</p>

              <p>If every sg driver is like you, I will be happy and glad to hear that.</p>
              <p>But unfortunately, some bad egg don't think like you and I might be the unlucky one if I am not alert and encounter one...</p>
              <p>As I say, I don't want to take the risk. Its human and survival sense.</p>

              <p>''common sense'' So how do you know they have no ''common sense''. Fact is, they may not even know that the light is turning red. As you said, they are<strong> tourist. </strong>It may be just a harmless question of asking for directions. You know the light is gonna turn red, so okay ignore and run, or better say something like lights gonna turn red then run together with them. No ones gonna blame you for ignoring. But calling them idiots.</p>

              <p>I think I have prove my point since someone finally agree to my view.</p>
              <p>I know many forumer like to troll and gloat at other people's plight,its ok.</p>
              <p>As long as you all understand what I am trying to imply even you don't like my style or not. Basically , most will react the same way like me.</p>
              <p>You may all type no and rebuke me whatever. But I know in yr heart, you all agree to the idiotic way of the tourist. Its late and I have make my point. If I offended anyone, all I can offer is 'Sorry'.</p>
              <p>But I will still stand by this thread. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
