              <p><br>It's all right Bhw33. I apologise for my earlier posts about you too.</p>
              <p>Hmm.. There's a misunderstanding somewhere. Rest assured that I'm not a SPG la. I look down on them (SPG) too. These immatured women are still having the old mindset that whites are superior!</p>
              <p>How did you get the impression that I'm a SPG? I like guys of my own race. Okay? Haha!!</p>
              <p>When I first saw your post, I thought you misquoted my name. I thought you meant SOME other person. But that person does not qualify to be a SPG. It's a SPT(Tranny) instead!! </p>
              <p>Yup.. I must apologise for the hurt and humilation that I caused onto you for naming you a clone of SPT <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"> </p>

              <p>I have to say, of all the countries I have been to, Singaporeans are the rudest, least helpful, least sympathetic, money grubbing place I have even been to. If the country is filled with people like BHW33, it is going to increase the stress and drama between the locals and expats. Couple of things to think about BHW</p>
              <p>If you are not nice, how can you expect in return? Why would you go out of your way to be mean and rude to someone you do not know? If there was a white woman with kids and groceries, would you so rudely slam doors, push them aside on buses, and hit the close elevator button? I would never do that to anyone regardless of their skin color, clothes, or whatever.</p>
              <p>As for "whites" being the devils here... look at the companies that are employing the locals - most of them are not Singaporean companies, look at the people taking care of the local charities, its not local people, and I dont know one local who is fostering a child that has been neglected or abandoned or abused... its all expats. So why again am I so bad because I have lighter skin? I am not white by the way, but Native American.</p>
              <p>So if you want to judge me, and be rude and mean, and a jerk because of my skin color, should I then assume, that you -</p>
              <p>1)abuse your maid</p>
              <p>2)ignore your children for said abused maid to raise</p>
              <p>3)yell and scream at your children and wife because you had a bad day</p>
              <p>4)only care about money and nice car</p>
              <p>5)that you ignore the poor, hungry, homeless, handicapped, or mentally challenged?</p>
              <p>6)abandon your parents in a home and never see them again?</p>
              <p>7)abuse animals</p>
              <p>8)pick your nose in public</p>
              <p>9)smoke like a train</p>
              <p>10)have a small penis?</p>
              <p>Maybe YOU should stop stereotyping. I try every day to be a good representative of my country, my culture, and the HUMAN race in general. I give to charity, I volunteer with charities, I clean up trash on your filthy beach, I recycle, I am taking care of 2 local children who were abused and neglected by theid SINGAPOREAN parents, and I am nice and friendly and helpful to strangers.</p>
              <p>If you wanna the world to change you have to first.</p>
