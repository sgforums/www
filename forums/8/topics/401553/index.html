              <p>The green man was flashing and a Benz was waiting for us to clear and turn right in another direction. This group of idiot want us to all get killed in the middle of road.</p>

              <p><br> You seem to have poor understanding of simple english.</p>
              <p>Sometimes Singaporean are slam for being rude and inconsiderate
              by foreigner, just like the recent report of some Australia
              report.</p>
              <p>Imagine the tourist are Australian ,asking direction in the
              middle of the road. As a sinaporean with basic common senses,
              trying to save yr own life and ignore his question and walk away
              quickly.</p>
              <p>The Australian thinking you are rude and go back start to label
              Singaporean as rude or inconsiderate. I wouldn't say all the thing
              reported by them as false. But definitely some of the news reported
              are questionable and they need to review their own action
              first.</p>
