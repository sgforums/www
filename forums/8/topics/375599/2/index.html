              <p>Now I want to talk a bit about insulting ads.</p>
              <p>The first one is the one with Good Mental Health promotion.....</p>
              <p>You know, one giraffe, one elephant, and one monkey.....</p>
              <p>The monkey said....."got peanut still better than no peanuts...."</p>
              <p>This is highly insulting.</p>
              <p>The first time I watched it, I was already uncomfortable....</p>
              <p>Second, third, and subsequent times I got more annoyed and irritated....</p>
              <p>It seems that the ads conceptor just want to equate people with monkeys and animals, and we should just better be thankful if we have peanuts to eat, meaning, we should lower ourselves to the standards of animals. As long as you have some basic neccessities met, you should not starve and so on, you should be happy.</p>
              <p>I find it very insulting, looking down on people, deliberate cheapening of human lives, crude, low class, no IQ, and stupid ads.</p>
              <p>Also, I can understand if some messages targetted towards children use cartoons and animals, that I can understand. But for a message targetted towards adults, struggling with economic crisis, it is highly patronising and insulting. Not only do they use kiddie method of using cartoon and animals, but they use a very crude and rude inference or message or principle.</p>
              <p>And then there is another one.</p>
              <p>In many public places, you can see Graciousness Campaign...</p>
              <p>They use Pua Chu Kang and Rosie in posters...and sometimes in songs and in videos..</p>
              <p>This is very insulting.</p>
              <p>I dont know what the conceptor of this ads was thinking when he was dreaming one night. Did he think it's such a good idea? No.</p>
              <p>PCK and Rosie are basically caricatures and stereotypes and examples of classism.</p>
              <p>I also notice Good Graciousness using PCK and Rosie are mostly aired in public places such as MRT, Bus stations, in other words, to the working masses, middle class and lower-middle-class.</p>
              <p>So this ads conceptor one night must be thinking, "Haha those poor people, I teach you good manners with your cousins, PCK and Rosie, who look exactly like you all"</p>
              <p>It's insulting, patronising, crude, rude, insensitive, no class, low-IQ, ads.</p>
              <p>The PCK and Rosie are depicted in typical low class manners according to their charicatured stereotypes typified by them, and the song also use the typical made-up not really Singlish but worse, "Gurmitlish" fictional accent, and so on.</p>
              <p>I think those two ads should be banned, completely.</p>
              <p>Please let me know what you think, and also are there any other ads you have found to be offensive?</p>

              <p>In the world of advertising, grabbing of attention is the most important thing... Not really the content(though I know this might be controversial)...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm sure everyone still remembers the Gatsby ads rite? N the McD ones?<br>That is becoz it has grabbed ur attention. That is advertising win. Public relations fail becoz the result is negative image portrayed to the client.</p>

              <p>In the world of advertising, grabbing of attention is the most important thing... Not really the content(though I know this might be controversial)...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm sure everyone still remembers the Gatsby ads rite? N the McD ones?<br>That is becoz it has grabbed ur attention. That is advertising win. Public relations fail becoz the result is negative image portrayed to the client.</p>

              <p>In social promotion advertising, it is different from profit generating organisation advertisment, those that lure you to buy and spend.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Social promotion expect no profit return but just a general reminder of our situation and what we are expected to behave and live within our situation and culture.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Animated advertisment include all, not only you, even the rich and the govt, they can be represent by pig or donkey. It tends to get the attention from both the childrens and adults. It is an expression with no real personalities and names involved. If you watch those american animated movies, it is both entertaining and it does send a message across.</p>

              <p>No la.. I think you missed the point of advertising. Advertising is to sell something. Can be a service or a product. Its not just for publicity. Lets say you are disgusted by a ad selling some kinda drink, will you be more likely to buy that drink? No, on the contrary, you will be less willing to buy the drink. And in some countries, people will actually boycott the product all together.</p>
              <p>Publicity does not equate to profit for the companies. Good publicity equates to profit, bad publicity equates to loss.</p>
              <p>We are the public. We are able to bring down entire companies by just speaking bad about it or we can make someone a billionaire by just speaking good about the company. So no, what you said is wrong =)</p>
