              <p>Now I want to talk a bit about insulting ads.</p>
              <p>The first one is the one with Good Mental Health promotion.....</p>
              <p>You know, one giraffe, one elephant, and one monkey.....</p>
              <p>The monkey said....."got peanut still better than no peanuts...."</p>
              <p>This is highly insulting.</p>
              <p>The first time I watched it, I was already uncomfortable....</p>
              <p>Second, third, and subsequent times I got more annoyed and irritated....</p>
              <p>It seems that the ads conceptor just want to equate people with monkeys and animals, and we should just better be thankful if we have peanuts to eat, meaning, we should lower ourselves to the standards of animals. As long as you have some basic neccessities met, you should not starve and so on, you should be happy.</p>
              <p>I find it very insulting, looking down on people, deliberate cheapening of human lives, crude, low class, no IQ, and stupid ads.</p>
              <p>Also, I can understand if some messages targetted towards children use cartoons and animals, that I can understand. But for a message targetted towards adults, struggling with economic crisis, it is highly patronising and insulting. Not only do they use kiddie method of using cartoon and animals, but they use a very crude and rude inference or message or principle.</p>
              <p>And then there is another one.</p>
              <p>In many public places, you can see Graciousness Campaign...</p>
              <p>They use Pua Chu Kang and Rosie in posters...and sometimes in songs and in videos..</p>
              <p>This is very insulting.</p>
              <p>I dont know what the conceptor of this ads was thinking when he was dreaming one night. Did he think it's such a good idea? No.</p>
              <p>PCK and Rosie are basically caricatures and stereotypes and examples of classism.</p>
              <p>I also notice Good Graciousness using PCK and Rosie are mostly aired in public places such as MRT, Bus stations, in other words, to the working masses, middle class and lower-middle-class.</p>
              <p>So this ads conceptor one night must be thinking, "Haha those poor people, I teach you good manners with your cousins, PCK and Rosie, who look exactly like you all"</p>
              <p>It's insulting, patronising, crude, rude, insensitive, no class, low-IQ, ads.</p>
              <p>The PCK and Rosie are depicted in typical low class manners according to their charicatured stereotypes typified by them, and the song also use the typical made-up not really Singlish but worse, "Gurmitlish" fictional accent, and so on.</p>
              <p>I think those two ads should be banned, completely.</p>
              <p>Please let me know what you think, and also are there any other ads you have found to be offensive?</p>

              <p>This is wat we call government sponsored ads.<br>We can't do anything about it. The government basically pays advertising firms or they do pro-bono work and since the paid sum is low(or maybe even none at all), this is the result of the 'quality' work...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>What do I think of it? I think its a good message being spread. The part where you thought we're being lowered into the animal ecosystem, well that's your opinion, but how else can the point of 'Be thankful there's peanuts' if it ain't a monkey saying it?</p>
              <p>I think it's an interesting ad. A tongue-in-cheek that should be viewed as the govt's relaxed state of advertising -- why be so strict and rigid? (No, not refering to TS or anyone in particular, but rather towards a mindset where we shouldn't get worked up over trivial matters).</p>
              <p>Loosen up, take it in your stride. As for the ad being a possible case of bad publicity (for anyone~), well, any publicity is gd publicity right?</p>
              <p>Chill, I think the ad is funny. Plus it's good to be content with whatever wealth that we have in our hands.</p>

              <p>From what I learn, the tongue-in-cheek method of advertising is one of the most likely to backfire.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is because many people intepret things different(as very evident from this thread) and some people might take offence.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But then again, for government ads, the main objective of the ad is to inform the key publics about governmental policies and to educate the key publics on why they should be aware of such policies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is a great sense of nonchalence of the people towards government policies, thinking that many of the policies do not concern them. The important part of such messages(in ads) is that the public must be interested in such policies.</p>
