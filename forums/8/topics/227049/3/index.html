            <div class='col-md body'>Ok give you all another one...<br><br>Agent A is suspected in leaking top secret information to another country..... So after much analysis we had already found out that he had only possibly leaked it in a restrauant where agent A eats for lunch. As only during this time when anget A is eating, Agent B ( From enemy country ) also sit in the same restruant. But the problem is both the agent had never talked to each other or sit near each other. Beside that something was noted by us is Both Agent A and B always wear the SAME Shirt, Pants, Hat, Tie and Shoes. Same Design and Same Color. The intinery of what they do is.<br><br>Agent A would comes in Put the hat at the door side hat holder in the restruant then proceed to the table at the far end of the corner and sit. Lift his hands and call the water. Order his food proceed to the toilet and comes back to finish the food. Agent B would do exactly the same but only siting right at the other corner. After Lunch they would left the place one by one. In between them there are like 5 tables, they never greet each other, never sit near each other, never talk to each other, never had ANY forms of physical contact and communication with each other at all... but just eat their food and left...the toilet is searched but Nothing at all was found.
