I wanted to ask her for a dance but was too shy to do so.<br><br>After the night ended I saw her with her friends again, sitting outside. After much pondering I finally pick up the courage to walk over to her...<br><br>Me: Hi... Will it be ok if I have a few seconds to tok to you?<br><br>Sweet Girl: Huh?<br><br>Me: (Repeat)Hi... Will it be ok if I have a few seconds to tok to you?<br><br>Sweet Girl: (stern face, straight tone)Ummpphhhh.... I'm leaving soon.<br><br>Me: (Dumbfounded and stammering) It's ok then. Thanks.<br><br>I GOT OUTRIGHT REJECTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>This is my very first time that I summon enough courage to talk to an unfamiliar face, but this has to happen!<br>I feel so embarassed (right in front of all her friends) and demoralised.

            <div class='col-md body'>hoho - some gals are going to get offended, but, i guess practice makes perfect. if you try doing it over a few more times, you`ll probably have a couple of better lines. maybe you`ll also somehow recognise the situations when they are more receptive to you.<br><br>i mean, if the dance is over, its 3, she wants to go home, she`s probably not going to talk much. next round, go talk to her while she`s sitting and looking at you. or when she`s at the bar having a drink.<br><br>on the downside, the gals will also have more practice at learning how to deal with guys coming up to them, with wit, tact and finesse.<br><br>wish you good luck for the next time you see someone you wanna befriend.</div>

If a guy were to ask a girl for a chat after the disco lights come on .. or when she's about to leave.. she might feel that the guy is after something more. If you try to waltz your way closer to her while you're both still dancing... then she might have given you a more favorable response.<br><br>In any case, even if she were to spurn your advances while you're still in the disco.. it would be easier to smile and just fade back into the masses.<br><br>BTW, after a whole night of sweating.. unless you look like some Baywatch hunk who's utterly droolsome when he's covered with sweat... you'd probably look a bit unpresentable and might even look a tad bit drunk to the girl.<br><br>------------------<br>Don't like what I'm saying?
