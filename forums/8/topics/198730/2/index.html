            <div class='col-md body'>I support the north korean move. Please dont listen to the western media, you are being brainwashed and pulled into their sphere of interest.<br><br>firstly, north korean is a sovereign country. It can do anything it wants within its own jurisdiction. Technically it is their right.<br><br>secondly, please understand the reason why north korea launched this missile. In order to understand this, you need to go back and see the fundamental reason, to know why north korea kept one of the largest armies in the world, and tried to develop nuclear weapons. You need to go to the roots, the background.<br><br>It's not because they have nothing better to do, it's because they feel they are besieged and threatened by USA and Japan. They are under constant worry. They have a deep sense of insecurity, that their nation is vulnerable.<br><br>Perhaps this feeling is a similar situation like in Singapore, where there is a underlying constant worry, and as a result there is military conscription in Singapore. Why do countries like Singapore have military conscription while some countries not? Why does north korea keep a large army and test missiles and develop nuclear weapons while some countries not? In order to know the answer you have to understand their situation and their mentality, what are they facing, what kind of conditions and challenges their country is in.<br><br>Right now north korea wants to negotiate directly with US. Why? because this is the root of all the insecurity and mistrust, this is basically a problem between north korea and US all along, a long lingering legacy problem from the past, resulting in the present regional setting. North korea has asked for bilateral negotiation directly with USA, apart from the six party talks, to fundamentally and strategically sort out their differences. USA has avoided and rejected any bilateral talks, it insists to use six party talks only. USA knows that if it gets 'to the real business' and not just the superficial talks, its strategic position may be jeopardized in the region, and it can lose some of its stranglehold and influence in the region. USA doesnt want to change the status quo, or its power.<br><br>now i have explained some background information. It is only a part.<br><br>Whatever you read, please dont dumb down your brain by following whatever is written. Firstly, western media is biased. Secondly, Singapore falls under the western sphere of influence. Whatever AP/ AFP/ Reuters write and their views will be parroted and re-broadcasted, since Singapore leaders had decided to allay themselves with Western blocs. This is the same like how Saddam or Iraq, or Iran is the case now, is always portrayed badly in the news in Singapore. Dont adopt their world view blindly.</div>

Nationally, their country is imporvished; their people are starving. Economically, their GDP ranks as one of the worst in the world, no doubt helped significantly by their closed door policy to trade. It seems the only thing they trade in is arms and weapons deals.
