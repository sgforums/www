              <p>dont make all girls sound superficial. we dont always go for
              looks and cash.</p>
              <p>isnt it good news they reply u in the shy manner? that means
              they bother about the way they present themselves in front of
              you.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Sorry I don't understand why going for looks and cash equates to superficialness? I mean, assuming that you are a highly attractive female, why is it superficial to want to hook up with someone who's attractive as well? considering the fact that your looks are above average, i do not think its superficial to want to consider a better looking partner. The reason why diamond cost more graphite is because diamonds look better on a ring than graphite, no?</p>
              <p>Why would requiring your partner to be financially stable considered superficial? Barring the occassional 'gold-digger' cases aside, it's ok not to be rich or wealthy or top 100 richest in sg, but do you not want your life long partner to be at least financially solvent, to be able to maintain a reasonable lifestyle, and to provide for your children's education? When I say go after a guy with $, i do not mean trying to hook up with someone who is rich just because you can 'benefit' and get the 'LVs, Guccis, etc etc'. Its ok not to be rich, but not ok to be completely broke. Because you can't survive on love.</p>

              it is inevitable to consider other factors. like education level or family background. i believe this is what makes up that someone we fall for as well. 
              
              i think i should say everyone comes as a package, we all look for whats in the package overall to decide if we want that package or not. in there may be the good and the not so good.
              
              we should like someone for who he is and not what he is. to me, things like $$$ belong to the what factor. you cant survive on love, neither can you survive on a relationship built on material stuff right?

              <p>Yes, sometimes love can make a person change for the better. But at the end of the day its still up to the person to change his mindset/attitude. I'm not saying that money can buy love or happiness.. but like the saying goes you cannot buy happiness, but without money, it sure is hard to be happy.. note, 'happy' is different from being 'content'. There's a difference between being contented with a certain lifestyle and having to worry about where or when the next meal is going to come, or living on the streets etc.</p>

              <p>Yes you are right, when we fall for someone most of the time we look at the whole package, which is the whole point of what we are trying to prove to TS. Sure TS may be good looking and physically attractive, but there are much more factors that make a gal 'fall' for you, etc etc.</p>

              <p>Well, I guess that's life isn't it? you can't please everyone, and whether you like it or not, there will be people who will love you for who you are, and similarly there will be people who will hate you for who you are. You can't please everyone, so i guess there's no point really in getting angry at your detractors.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You posted here seeking for help as to why, despite your above average physical attractiveness, has so far been unable to have a relationship with a gal. Instead of reflecting on your own character, you choose to focus instead on the gal thinking that the gal does not know how to 'appreciate' your physical attributes. Let me tell you, there are tons of guys out there who are fatter, balder, less fit, uglier, etc than you, but they have gfs, some of which you might deem their gfs in the 'chio bu' category. If they can do it, so can you. So you might be fit and good looking, but this in fact has been your downfall because you are so focused on YOU, YOURSELF, and your LOOKS and BODY, that you neglect what gals really want and look for in a guy, for a relationship.</p>
