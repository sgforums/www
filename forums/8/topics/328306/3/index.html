                                      and whether you like it or not, there will be people who will love
                                      you for who you are, and similarly there will be people who will
                                      hate you for who you are. You can't please everyone, so i guess

              <p>You posted here seeking for help as to why, despite your above
                                      average physical attractiveness, has so far been unable to have a
                                      relationship with a gal. Instead of reflecting on your own
                                      character, you choose to focus instead on the gal thinking that the
                                      gal does not know how to 'appreciate' your physical attributes. Let
                                      me tell you, there are tons of guys out there who are fatter,
                                      balder, less fit, uglier, etc than you, but they have gfs, some of
                                      which you might deem their gfs in the 'chio bu' category. If they
                                      can do it, so can you. So you might be fit and good looking, but
                                      this in fact has been your downfall because you are so focused on
                                      YOU, YOURSELF, and your LOOKS and BODY, that you neglect what gals
                                      really want and look for in a guy, for a relationship.</p>

"tall , slightly muscular and lean guys".  yeah u have that 6 pac n 2 protruding chest. but they dont really look nice, you need board shoulder and huge biscep to complement them. And ur so call tall is how tall, comparing you with the warerobe doors, u can only be qualify as "not short" or "slight taller than average".  I see that you have abit of eurasian looks, maybe u do have that exotic look. why not u post a clearer pic of urself.

              <p>Dude, We are al trying to help you with the issue but if you choose to get personal than all I can say is: "Good Luck to those you are dating."</p>
              <p>Point 1: If you think this is a platform to advertise yourself ,than you have succeded but not in a positive way.</p>
              <p>Point 2: Birds of a feather flock together, how do you expect to have a deep relationship when you are going on and on about how good you look? If you have spent more time finding beauty in the people around you instead of staring at your own bulging muscles, you will realise that looks r not forever. People age...... years later, all our skin will be shrivelled and dry, bones more brittle than a porcelain vase.</p>
              <p>It is not how good looking the VASE looks but what it holds.</p>
              <p>Point 3: Have you ever asked yourself why women come up to you and tell you that you are cute and all but meaningful relationships never does come as a result of that?</p>
              <p>A case of Good to see...but once the mouth opens...... that's it!</p>

              <p>huh is that really u ? not that as gd as the topic sounds leh.
              "tall , slightly muscular and lean guys".  yeah u have that 6

              board shoulder and huge biscep to complement them. And ur so call
              tall is how tall, comparing you with the warerobe doors, u can only
              be qualify as "not short" or "slight taller than average".  I
              see that you have abit of eurasian looks, maybe u do have that
              exotic look. why not u post a clearer pic of urself. No offense

              <p>It is pretty obvious you started this thread for self-aggrandizement purposes.  Ok, so you are better looking than the average joe.  Big deal...it only means you are blessed with good-looking genes from your parents.  That does not mean you are special or better than others. </p>
              <p>From your sacarstic remarks "to all the fatties, ugly, mongoloids...", you definitely has  narcissistic personality disorder, and you look down on people whom you think are not as good looking as you.  Just because you are good looking does not mean you deserve more to life than others.  And by the way, we don't use the term "mongoloid" any longer, "people with down syndrome" is the politically correct term.  I dare you to use that term in front of people from Mongolia.  To me the "people with down syndrome" are better than you; at least they don't judge a book by its cover only.</p>
              <p>No, I don't think girls hate guys who are "tall, slightly muscular, and lean guys"...but they do dislike arrogant, air-headed, guys who look at themselves in the mirror all the time.</p>
