            <div class='col-md body'>The compulsory education issue came to light when the New Paper and other major news publishers started to write articles on the children who were deprived of a formal education. There was also the question of the viability of Islamic schools and their role in our modern society.<br>(damned i'm starting to sound like a GP essay  :p)<br><br>I guess the education system was designed from ground up to enhance the country's survivability way back after independence. Then we needed manpower with rudimentary skills...fast. So more or less our parents came out of the same factory, from the same mould of mass-produced stuff.<br><br>How about now? Is such a system still competitive in this fast changing world where globalisation is key to reaching out to the world. Can it pull our country out from spiralling into tomolo's case studies and obscure history texts? i dunno...but so far we've been able to benchmark ourselves quite favourably against students from other countries...<br>(if it ain't broke dun fix it??)<br><br>6yrs of compulsory education allows all kids to start on a more or less level ground. may also let some poorer families be able to pull themselves out of the poverty cycle..<br>With the liberalisation of markets and globalisation, the sad fact of a free market economy is that the poor will get poorer and the rich richer. ie. widening wealth gap. May pose a major problem to the harmony and balance of society next time.<br>At least imbue them with some sort of foundation i guess.<br><br>aiyah most of ot will depend on the implementation...how they decide to enforce this compulsory education. if done inappropiately, the best intentions can end up doing more harm also mah<br><br>(hi peiyi!!)<br><br>------------------<br>*~*~*~*~*~*~*~**~*~*~*~*~*~*~**~*~~*<br>"To see the world in a grain of sand,<br>and the heavens in a wild flower; to hold<br>a flower in the palm of your hand, an<br>eternity an hour..."</div>

I remember seeing 2 children selling curry puffs near an MRT station every day. I reckon that they should be of age 12. And I'm wondering what are they doing there instead of studying at school. Thus I believe that compulsory education is good as it will make those family of low income send their children to school, however, the government will need to have special education funds for these special cases.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wahhhhhhhhhhhh, what a surprise when I read this topic. What is 6 years of compulsory education? Does it mean compulsory for all the parents have to send their children to school at least from primary 1 to primary 6? OhhhhhhhÂ¡Kwhat a good policy!!! hehe<br><br>But do you guys know that our government ( hong kong government) enforced 9 years compulsory education from 198x? and it is free too. how many steps your sg educational policy behind ours in this aspect? haha, don't get me wrong, I am not showing of what, just showing my support to the compulsory education. I have to thank for our government, if there is not free and compulsory educational policy, I wouldn't have a chance to study in university now, might be I was force to work after primary school as I come from a poor family. And sure there are many poor students like me get benefits from it. So I feel amazed that Singapore enforce compulsory education so late, and only onlyyyyy 6years.<br><br>Why does the government enforce compulsory education? Ensure everyone have a chance to receive a certain degree of education to survive in this competitive society? If for this reason, 6 years primary education is definitively not enough. How many students drop their studies after primary 6 nowadays? is this policy useful? I think it just like setting a price ceiling which is higher than the market price, haha, anyway, better than doing nothing, after all.<br><br>Is compulsory education for forcing parents to send their children to school? If there are still have not a small group of parents not sending their children to school in Singapore in this 21 century, another surprise to me. Why don't they send their children to school? Are they poor and can't afford the tuition fee? Or they are low educated and don't know the importance of education? For whatever reasons, the children should have the chance to be educated. If the children are stayed at home for the former reason, then I can't imagine how wide is the gap between poor and rich in Singapore, as it is such a wealth country. Anyway, government has to give some financial supporting to those poor families at the same time of compulsory education. . (I suppose the education is not free in Singapore, am I right?)<br><br>Feel free to correct me if I am wrong, as I know not very much about the education in Singapore. thanks<br><br>FireIce: referring to your first question, I think both parents and government's business for whether let the children have an education. the reasons already mentioned above. hehe<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, I don't think compulsory education conflict with the democracy. What the government did just want to ensure everyone has a chance to receive basic education, how can illiteracy survives in this knowledgeable economic society?<br><br>Just think of the kids who selling curry puffs, do they choose democracy or education? oh, maybe they even don't know what democracy is. Democracy to them means nothing.<br><br>It is ironic that in such a wealth country, there are still a group of people even can't support their children for basic education. Maybe that is nobody's responsibility but theirs. But it is truly sad that the next generation becoming the victims. No education means no future. So the government should take over this responsibility inevitably.<br><br>Yeah, education is not cheap in everywhere, just treat it as an investment, the same to the government.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just how many of us are guilty of mugging 10 year series questions to the point that answering questions in the exams is nothing more than an attempt to regurgitate?<br><br>It seems that no matter how glamorous we present our education model, it all boils down to 1 fact. When we study, do we get interested, excited about what we read and discuss? Or are we merely memorising, regurgitating facts and formulae?<br><br>The system will always categorize you based on how 'intelligent' you are (to them that is) When the system tells you that you are only mediocre, then you are. And you category will come back to haunt you wherever you go.<br><br>I know, because I sell laksa now.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>KTE shrugs.<br><br>I think learning how to read, write, speak, do simple Maths are important. Just the basics you know? I don't know if the kids are smart enough to question why they need to study this, why they have to study that. If they don't want to learn how to read and write, well...?<br><br>A PSLE ain't no big deal at all. Just six years to learn the basics, is that too much? Sure, the government's being pushy by making it compulsory, but I'm sure every parent who cares about their children would want them to learn at least the basics.</div>
