Furthermore, grades is also not that impressive.<br><br>No choice, nowadays seems that having degree is a must in order to proceed further in your career. No degree and have experience the employers dun even bother to consider promoting you.

Certain modules, esp mathematics related modules, have their syllabi different/modified/reduced from the ones the full-time students study. Consequently the part time students and the full time students sit for different exams. Most of the other modules are pretty much the same and the both types of students sit for the same exams.<br><br>Now, here comes a very important difference between the NTU and NUS part-time courses. In NTU your grading will be done together with the full time students, meaning, you will be competing with some 400 odd students for your grades. Consequently, even though you might have done well your grades might get pushed down(i don't expect any part-time student to be able to compete with a full time student on equal terms). In the NUS version, the grading is restricted to just your cohort of part time students, meaning, you will competing for grades only with other part time students (say about 100). Naturally your chances of getting better grades are higher at NUS.<br><br>I know of people who studied at NTU for 3 sems only to quit and join NUS. The reason.....how much ever effort they put in their grades can never be high.<br><br>Another downside of the NTU degree is that, since it follows the full-time curriculum exactly, you will have all those enrichment modules to study for (and sit for exams). And the total number of these enrichment modules turns out to be about 6!!! Thats almost 2 semesters and $6000.0 worth of modules that isn't going to be of any practical use. The part-time students have to study modules like genetics, economics etc etc.<br><br>On the upside................hey you get a degree exactly like the full time students!!! You won't fall victim to the stigma that some people seem to attach to part-time students.<br><br>I am not too sure how the employees look at the 2 degrees but NUS Btech is accredited by the PE board of Singapore as well IEEE.
