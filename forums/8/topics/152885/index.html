Here she displays one of the sexy outfits she will wear for the event. Her designers are Anita Dongre, Ritu Kumar and Ashley Rebello. By Vimla Patil<br><br>Mumbai: April 18, 2005/Sawf News Service/ -- Bollywood is truly going global! After the super successful visit of Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao to India, news says that Chinese superstar Jackie Chan will introduce Mallika Sherawat at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2005 as the heroine of his film The Myth. Quentin Tarantino and Robert De Niro are scheduled to be there too! And Mallika is excited already. To avoid the fiasco which Aishwarya Rai had to face from the media because of her unfortunate choice of designers for her wardrobe for the various events during the Cannes Film Festival when she went there some while ago, Mallika is being choosy and asking top designers Anita Dongre, Ashley Rebello and Ritu Kumar to design her Cannes wardrobe. <br><p>“Jackie has asked me to wear clothes which are very glam, very sexy and very Indian for the big party,” enthuses the sex symbol actor, “And I’m going to wow the world!” Her new release in India, Bachke Rehna Re Baba teams her with Rekha, the diva of Bollywood. But Mallika hopes to oust her and take over the title of the Indian diva. “I don’t care what people say about me as long as I deliver success in my career,” she says, “After all George-Bush-bashing has been a popular pastime worldwide. Does he care?” she laughs.<br><br>more about the film here:<a href="http://www.monkeypeaches.com/themyth.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.monkeypeaches.com/themyth.html</a></p></div>
