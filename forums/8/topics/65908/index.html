Before many cancers happen, usually the Liver will be the first to get sick.<br><br>Liver filters out the poisons and it attacks all other viruses in the<br>body.<br><br>99% Chinese have weak livers as they eat a lot of meat, and high fat foods.<br><br>The Liver's repair time is effective from 11pm to 3am. Therefore,<br>sleeping late after 11pm &amp; having late night supper 2 hours before<br>sleep especially high cholesterol and high fat foods weakens the Liver as it does not have sufficient time to rest and regenerate. Even when one sleeps in later in the morning to replace loss sleep will not help.<br><br>If U get very hungry just before bedtime, eat some fruits &amp; vegetables which is easy to digest. Meat takes about 4 hours to digest before it goes into the intestines. Meat cooked in oil takes about 12 hours before going into the intestines. This will provoke the Liver &amp; the digestive tract to overwork in filtering the toxins thus U will tend to feel very tired when U wake up in the morning.<br><br>Oil is the main culprit that will weaken the functions of the Liver and<br>damage it. Medication cannot cure Liver problem and it will damage it even further.<br><br>Cold-pressed Olive oil , carrot, cucumber, raw chili, garlic, onion,<br>little bamboo salt/ sea-salt, radish, pumpkin and small fish are good<br>for the body.

When using eye-cover during bed-time, use only pure-cotton and do not use Rubber, latex material.<br><br>A Detoxification Diet helps the Liver &amp; Intestines to recover fast.<br>Natural fresh foods are best for the Liver and overall well being. Do<br>not rely on packed , bottled or canned health foods/ vitamins as they lack a lot of natural and essential vitamins which can only be derived from pure, unprocessed natural foods.<br><br>A balance of mental/ emotional state of mind is very important to the<br>total well-being. Too much Stress of all kinds, loud noises/music,<br><br>Anger, irritation suppressed for too long, Pessimism, depressive moods, no goalsin life, feeling life has no value or blaming the World &amp; Everyone else for his life will further weaken the body system. When the Liver is unhealthy, the Person usually has a bad temper and gets easily angered or irritated.<br><br>Giving out Gas, perspiration and urine are ways of purging out the<br>toxins from the body. Do not use too much of air-conditioners as they suppress the body from perspiration. This natural way of purging helps to reduce the load of the Liver.
