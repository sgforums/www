            <div class='col-md body'>sometimes they dont catch cos they are on a case goign to somewhere. not patrolling. hmm yea. oh and they speed too. no lights, no sirens but i gave way to the wrx tp and he juz sped off usually they cruise at speed limit so i follow behind  but when i came back to the lane and resumed 90 he was gettign further so i tried 100 and 110 and he still kept going further and further away. but like i siad no lights, no sirens. speed for what.<br><br>another case. a police car (not tp but police) took the bus lane durign bus lane operation hours to cut the traffic jam on the other 2 or 3 lanes on upper serangoon road. didn't speed. no lights, no sirens. but i tot mebe he on urgent case but muz be covert ambush that kind. so he continued on the bus lane for 2 or 3 traffic light junctions and guess what.. he then turned into a shell petrol station to pump petrol. i was like.. wth? so pumping petrol is a good reason for driving on the bus lane. i got his license plate number too but didnt report cos forgot the date n time liao. oh well.. i've seen so many but close one eye la they also human being.</div>
