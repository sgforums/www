In my 5 years plus of gambling, the biggest payout for football was Man U vs Liverpool 2 seasons ago. $25 on Liverpool to win 4-1 and it came back $3750. I had spread my bets on several pick the scores so I only had $25 for 4-1. I also had a good streak of winning a few thousand dollars on soccer over many matches, however that streak eventually ended. A few months ago I won toto $3000+. However, if you think that Im lucky, you got to see the whole picture. I had really bad runs of luck too. Overall I have to say gambling made me poorer by 20+ k, and have tried to quit many times, but failed. Dont gamble your life away, find other recreational activites and other ways of income. It is not worth your time and money.</p></div>
