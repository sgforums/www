            <div class='col-md body'>Well , if there is a girl who is seen smoking, it causes others to have a thinking that she is a bad girl. So it will be harder for others to see the true nature of whether she is or not.<br>However, no matter what type of people is found smoking, they will have a HARD time to quit smoking. And gradually suffer....<br><br>Remember , Don't smoke. If you want to, do it at YOUR OWN RISK.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the number of smokers among the young in s'pore has steadily increased (guess those anti-smoking campaigns aren't really that effective huh?).  but seriously, i really don't understand why people want to smoke.  coz to relieve stress?  believe me, stress would be the least of worries should one happen to get any health problems (choi choi choi!).  peer pressure?  well, that says a lot abt friends if they pressure one to smoke.  to look "stylo"?  there are many MANY other ways to look great without a cigg in the hand.<br><br>btw, anyone heard the use of the term "social smoker"?  i heard this b4 in reference to people who smoke when they only visit nite spots.  DUHZ!  another phenomenon which i failed to understand.  these are the people who are non-smokers at heart, but prefer to light up at nite spots.  why?  maybe they want to 'fit in'?  i just can't understand.<br><br>smoking looks equally bad to me whether the smoker is a guy or a girl.  to all the non-smokers out there, please, please don't start.  for all the smokers, please, please try to quit.  its slow suicide.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously though, what's the use of smoking anyway ? Government doesn't ban it because it could get some money out of it. But it makes it clear that it is at one's risk. Cigarette Smoking may stink badly to others, and i m not happy if it gets to my nose when i got a bad cold.<br>But then again. Cigarette smoking is one thing , but attitude is another thing. Non-Smokers will NOT &lt; i repeat&gt;, NOT toletrate to smokers with stinky attitudes more. ^ ^ &lt; Teasing someone here &gt; Yes. You know who i mean ! Not being gentleman, but rather holding onto your temper ^ ^. &lt; My, do you know you can't say F word in most forums and else where ? &gt;</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Of course we all know smoking is bad for the health, and that is why I mind my g/f(furture whoever will be) to smoke although I am a smoker myself for more than 10 yrs. I will object to her smoking if she started to smoke when she is with me. But if she has already started before we went 'steadyship', I guess encourage both to quit smoking together is a better effective way. I do need encourage from my love ones to help me, especially her. But if she insist to smoke, well still it does not bother me much, I myself is a smoker do I have the rights to stop my g/f from smoking?<br><br>------------------<br>Love may not make the world spin around, but it makes a lot of pple dizzy</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Now is the time to reply after reading what everyone has said...hmmm...<br><br>REgarless of what we think...has anyone besides Anna noticed that many mnay girls smoke????  In fact I think more girls than guys smoke...Just an observation and from experience.  I been out with a lot of people here and it's usually the guys who dun smoke and the girls who do....<br><br>Now of course there are a lot of girls that don't, but smoking has become a sign of the females independence from "male  oppression and control"...Where men used to be the ones to smoke now the women are...Turn the tables around...<br><br>I think that nothing is wrong with that...The problem I have is to see 13-15 year old kids smoking and pretending they know how to smoke when they can barely hold the ciggg....so sad and eventully harmful....When  see a late teen or adult smoking I think nothing of it...It's a very asian thing to smoke....More asians smoke than Westerners if you didn't know.<br><br>And just a note...if your looking for a chio Gf then most likely she will smoke...just a fact that if they are pretty they will usually socialise more...and the more they socialise the more likely they will pick up smoking...<br><br>Like anna said, go Boat Quay, orchard, Zouk, Velvet, Sparks, anywahere and you will see that so many girls smoke...<br><br>Just remember that women who smoke are more prone to disease and complications than men...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To:anna<br>Not all people think that smoking girl= bad girl. Not because I also a smoker.<br><br>I have friends(girls) who smoke where they are now in polytechnic.They very nice girls.<br>I also friends(girls) who don't smoke &amp; they never think about the future beside playing.<br>People had this kind of idea-smoking girls=bad girls.They must not be a smoker.<br><br>IN MY OWN VIEW, I think we youngster just don't really care much about ourselves.Just like we slept late and the high sugar thing we eat.<br>So, smoking girls is not a bad girls.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i tink smokers shud b more sensitive about whether their 2nd hand smoke will disturb others non-smokers or not. i haf seen pple in the bus-stop covering their mouth n nose coz someone directly in front of dem is happily puffing away. i mean we dun fart when we r standing directly in front of pple rite?<br><br>------------------<br>wud u mind pulling mi finger?</div>
