            <div class='col-md body'>Well, i think its because of all the sterotype being placed on smokers. When you see someone smoke, won't your mind tell you that he/she is a beng or lian?? well i amit that I am the type who believes that smoking girl/boy, = to bad boy or girl. I know that my thinking is very shallow, and i hope this topic can enlighten me ^^</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anna...<br>To me, whether gender difference of guys or gals smoke does not matter. Cos the image they portray to me is the same. Smoking is hazardous to oneself as well as others. But one thing for sure, no matter how good looking a person is, once he/she lights up a cigrette, my impression of the person declines greatly, not taking into consideration his/her character.<br><br>It is actually a mental set, it does not matter who smokes. It is more of why they want to smoke.Just dun understnad why ppl smoke since they understand that there are so many hazards to it. And the excuse that it helps to release stress is purely sublimal.<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with you Rinoa. To me, smokeing not only affects your health, the financial burden is also great. 1 pack of smoke cost about $5 here.. dunno about singapore. well, some of my friends smoke 2 pack a day, that means $10 a day. think of how much you can save if you don't smoke. Image is another thing. Most people smoke to look "cool", or peer pressure. Most people I know really want to stop, but find it hard. I know i am getting off topic here, but i am just shareing my thoughts with you guys..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it's natural for ppl to associate ppl who smoke as "bad" ppl.. since most of the ppl who light behave in a certain kinda way i.e bengs,lians....<br><br>it's true that most ppl will think not too highly of a person when he/she lights up ... it's sure is a wet blanket when i see some nice girl smoking.. it's like she's off my nice girl list immediately..<br><br>well... but it's not true that ppl who smoke are bad company . My friend smokes and he's a great guy . But ppl generally see him as a bad kinda person cos he lights up.<br><br>I guess it's like (someone mentioned earlier on)a mental mindset.</div>

I feel happier and healthier now.<br><br>The main thing is to find out why u smoke. For me, its an outlet when I feel troubled and stressful. Now dun say that its the mindset, coz I feel that it is a good distraction, esp when u see the smoke curling up to the air, sortof like yur problems vanishing. Also, I juz light one when I am bored, waiting for someone, nothing to do etc. I dun do that in front of my frens though, coz they dun like it.<br><br>Once u've established the reason, juz attack from the cause. Eg. I smoke when I am bored, so find something to do, dun make yurself bored. If its the problems, find someone to tok abt it, or solve it now, dun procrastinate.<br><br>I still feel the urge occasionally, this is my fourth attempt and I am sticking to it this time.<br><br>If I can do it, so can u...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey. my $0.02 worth on this topic. I've been smokin since sec 3. Science Course, Finished Diploma in Computer Studies. And ok. I'm in Uni , doin Bach of network computin. My grades aren't *that* bad. So do you associate me as a "BAD" boy? haha. I guess not. Lighting a fag is the FASTEST stress reliever.<br><br>I'm stressed rite now.. and the longest I've gone without lighting up is 2 days. Call it a lack of willpower or anything, but I just dun want to give it up. BTW I took pure bio and got distinction.. so its not as if I dun know what goes on inside. Its I just dun care. SO what? you want to live forever? I just hate it when peeps give me that look when I light up. WTF? Dun exert your influence over me. I move away to avoid blowin smoke at other people ya know. SO WHY CAN'T I DO AS I WANT?<br><br>Sure.. perhaps I deserve it coz me gf(ex) smokes as well.. Dun kinda like the idea but *shrugs*. Its ur own life. Live it the way you want.<br><br>DO ya know HOW MUCH TAX is being PAID on a cigg? .. go figure.. 1 carton menthols $14.90 at Sg duty free. Buying from mama stall would be arnd .. $58. Multiply that by the number of packs sold a day. The figure is astronomical. the Govt ban smoking? LOL. NO WAY. I pay for what I smoke. The Roads you walk on. EVERYTHING. I contribute to the friggin govt coffers. SO WHY CAN'T WE HAVE OUR OWN SPACE? UNDERSTAND. WE ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE ECONOMY! So go take ur argument elsewhere coz there isn't one in the first place. We have our rights.<br><br>If you dun like that. . . .<br><br>Go away. . . .<br><br>Period.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>girl smoking= bad girl...<br><br>it seriously depends on the individual...<br>but most of the girls whom i saw smoking r normally those lians... so i tend 2 associate smoking with bad girls...<br><br>but it's farni tt people dun associate guys smoking as bad guys but yet they associate girl smoking as bad girls...<br>2 quote another example:<br>if a guy has many gfs, then he's macho, attractive n appealing 2 the opposite sex... but if a girl has many bfs, most people will think of her as slut, cheap etc...<br><br>basically, it all depends on the mindset...</div>
