Most gyms have these "Body" type aerobics....and I believe they are on a fixed schedule, so you'll go through the same steps at any gym anywhere in the world at any one time (they change their steps every few weeks and label it Body Attack.

Typically, Planet Fitness would be approx. $1000 per year (much cheaper if you join long-term, like 3 years at a time).  California Fitness is cheaper on an equal-basis comparison).<br><br>No idea about FitnessFirst, sorry.<br><br>As for me, I had it at a very special promotional rate last year (Planet Fitness Suntec branch for only S$150 for the whole year <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> ).  Got it through an affiliate club.  Now no more liow....<br><br></div>
