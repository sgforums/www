              <p>I was talking with a friend about this the other day, and read an article on the corpun website.  It seems that the Singapore government likes to cane people, by bodybuilders trained in martial arts, leaving scars for life, and excruciating pain.  Now, you might argue that these people deserve it because they commit horrible crimes like rape, but I have a lot of questions:</p>
              <p>(1) First, is it true that you can not only get the cane for serious offences, but also relatively minor offences such as graffiti, shoplifting, and overstaying your visa?  I read that there are over 3000 people caned for overstaying every year, which would add up to about half of the entire caned population.</p>
              <p>(2) While several blue-collar offences such as drug dealing and minor crimes like graffiti are targeted by caning, why is it that Singapore doesn't cane offenders such as spammers?  Or white collar fraudsters that rip off the poor?  It seems the caning unfairly discriminates against the underclasses.</p>
              <p>(3) With regard to the caners themselves, what is their typical age and background?  How do they get selected?  How young (or old) do they have to be?  I heard that persons as young as 16 can be caned, is it true that persons this young can become caners also?</p>
              <p>(4) Singapore prisons are pretty horrible.  So for example, if someone is caught dealing drugs, wouldn't 10 years in a Singapore prison be enough punishment, rather than making them undergo this additional agony?</p>
              <p><br>Just curious and asking some questions, I hope you can respect them.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>When Michael Fay was canned in Singapore, Larry King, in his interview in CNN, was told that canning in Singapore is held in the middle of the city square, a special platform set up, and canning is done in front of a big audience, another american said that a US aircraft carrier was actually heading to Singapore to evacuate the americans who could be canned for sympathizing with fellow american......hahahaha....</p>

              <p>Friend.....let me ask you this question....</p>
              <p>Do you believe parents should be allowed to cane or spank their children ?</p>
              <p>First you think about this first.</p>
              <p>The answer probably would reveal your ideological and philosophical bent.</p>
              <p>If your answer is no (I suspect it is a no), then I would understand if you think caning by the government is also excessive.</p>
              <p>But I personally believe parents should be allowed to cane and spank their children, and therefore I also believe the government should be having this option to cane crime offenders especially and particularly for those anti-social behaviour such as in the case of graffiti, and also for violent crimes like rape.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I was talking with a friend about this the other day, and read
              an article on the corpun website.  It seems that the Singapore
              government likes to cane people, by bodybuilders trained in martial
              arts, leaving scars for life, and excruciating pain.  Now, you
              might argue that these people deserve it because they commit
              horrible crimes like rape, but I have a lot of questions:</p>
              <p>(1) First, is it true that you can not only get the cane for
              serious offences, but also relatively minor offences such as
              graffiti, shoplifting, and overstaying your visa?  I read that
              there are over 3000 people caned for overstaying every year, which
              would add up to about half of the entire caned population.</p>
              <p>(2) While several blue-collar offences such as drug dealing and
              minor crimes like graffiti are targeted by caning, why is it that
              Singapore doesn't cane offenders such as spammers?  Or white
              collar fraudsters that rip off the poor?  It seems the caning
              unfairly discriminates against the underclasses.</p>
              <p>(3) With regard to the caners themselves, what is their typical
              age and background?  How do they get selected?  How young
              (or old) do they have to be?  I heard that persons as young as
              16 can be caned, is it true that persons this young can become
              caners also?</p>
              <p>(4) Singapore prisons are pretty horrible.  So for example,
              if someone is caught dealing drugs, wouldn't 10 years in a
              Singapore prison be enough punishment, rather than making them
              undergo this additional agony?</p>
              <p><br> Just curious and asking some questions, I hope you can respect
              them.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>1) You will get caned for graffiti, but not overstaying. Caning in school for shoplifters who are students.</p>
              <p>2)You must understand...*clears throat*, they are rich.......don't want to tranish the reputation of company.. </p>
              <p>3)I don't know, I also got see school caning before. </p>
              <p>4)Singapore prisions are horrible?? Go India or Bangladash, you see for yourself...Must wack the drug dealers to ensure that they wouldn't do it again...cos cane will break those hardden criminals.. </p>

              <p>Friend.....let me ask you this question....</p>
              <p>Do you believe parents should be allowed to cane or spank their
              children ?</p>
              <p>First you think about this first.</p>
              <p>The answer probably would reveal your ideological and
              philosophical bent.</p>
              <p>If your answer is no (I suspect it is a no), then I would
              understand if you think caning by the government is also
              excessive.</p>
              <p>But I personally believe parents should be allowed to cane and
              spank their children, and therefore I also believe the government
              should be having this option to cane crime offenders especially and
              particularly for those anti-social behaviour such as in the case of
              graffiti, and also for violent crimes like rape.</p>

              <p>If we don't cane our kids, it will turn worst. Recently there was news. A german boy called police and reported child abuse, after he was asked his mother to pick the paper in floor and put it in bin.</p>
              <p>But caning an adult is a different thing. if an adult who has established self-esteem (I don't say it is an ego) caned, after that can he be normal in the society. Say, a lion, if it is poorly treated, can it be normal. Caning for graffitti or over-staying is too much. Caning for outrage-of-modesty is ok</p>

              <p>If women offenders are not caned,their jail sentences should be extended for crimes like maid and child-abusing or other offenses that warrant caning for men.Men don't have Men's Charter but women have their own laws to protect them from caning.</p>
              <p>But women seems to get off with only a light sentence and a fine when they commit crimes here.</p>

              <p>Do you believe a man should punch a woman ?</p>
              <p>Do you believe in war, the men should go in front first, and fight ?</p>
              <p>From the answers of those question, it will reveal your social and ideological beliefs.</p>
              <p>If you believe a man should never punch a woman, and in times of war, the men should go first.....maybe it is easier for you to accept women should not be physically caned.</p>
              <p>To me it's the same idea and it flows together.......</p>
