            <div class='col-md body'>Here is an archive of the information you may find useful:<br><br>First of all, you need to assess your own potential to be an air stewardess.  Are you at least 1.58m in height and slim with a good complexion?  Do you have '0' levels and above qualifications and an interest in the service industry?<br><br>If you answer 'yes' to the above questions, then you will need to check your smile in the mirror?  Can you smile properly and sincerely, showing a nice set of pearlies?<br><br>If you are confident of your smile, then check your body for any obvious scars, birthmarks or tattoos.  They are an absolute "no-no" in this industry.  Also make sure that you are not afraid of heights. (very impt...I will explain later)<br><br>Please subject yourself to the above checks so that you do not get overly disappointed if you fail at the first interview due to what I pointed over above.<br><br>After you have done the necessary and very satisfied with yourself, then you can start looking out for recruitment advertisements for air stewardess by various airlines in the newspapers.  Another good way is to check the websites of the airlines so that you can be informed of any upcoming interviews.<br><br>The first interview is a walk-in interview.  For this interview, make sure that you have light makeup on.  Wear a knee length skirt or dress, so that you are more conscious of the way you walk and your actions.<br><br>There are a few rounds in the first interviews and what is tested in each round may vary from airlines to airlines.  The tester may ask you to read a paragraph, announcing the ETA and the weather of a country,give a simple introduction of yourself, play a team game and do a one to one interview with a person from the airline.  Just remember, even though the tests might vary, the main principles still remain the same.  Remember my tips below!<br><br>I will PM you the link for the rest of it. Kinda lengthy.<br><br>Cheers!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Few months back I was forced to go for Qatar Airways interview. Purpose is just to follow my friend.<br><br>But he told me to hand in my resume as well. Just for the fun of it. I was like, what the heck.<br><br>So, the first day, we went to a ballroom and watch a corporate video of Qatar Airways and the country itself. Then a talk by a senior stewardess and the training officer on what to expect paywise, environment everything. And finally to hand in our resume and wait for their call.<br><br>Total attendees on that day was over 300 people. Anyway, in the afternoon I got a call from them telling me to go for the next round of interview. I didnt want to go but my friend forced me too as he got in as well.<br><br>I went to the location the next day and was surprise, less than 60 people actually made it. We were separated into two groups. And we did an english test. During the test we were asked one by one for our height and weight.<br><br>After the test, we were asked to form a group and we had a group discussion. The point is to discuss among ourselves while the interviewers scan through each and every one of us.<br><br>After that we went out of the room and give the interviewers time to evaluate us. 15 mins later, we went back into the room and was one by one told who is accepted for the next round.<br><br>My friend wasnt and to my surprise I am. So I went to the next round and this time its the final one. I had a face to face talk. Talked about my family, my future and past experience. We talked about the paywise and jobscope.<br><br>Finally, they took out the contract form and I told them " Ermm can I call you?"<br><br>Then I walk out of the place. Haha cos I am not ready to be in the working industry.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by beavan:</div><div class="quote_body">nice one congrats. did u accept the contract?</div></blockquote>No. I had no intention of flying as a career. Though it seems glamourous.<br><br>I just went for the interview just to accompany my friend.<br><br>They call me up the next few days, but i declined. They were surprise that rarely someone would reject the offer. But i told them i wanna continue with my studies.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
