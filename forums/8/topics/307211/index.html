              <p>Hi! I'm new to this forum, not sure am i right to post my appeal for help here....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div id="item_body" class="bodytext">
              <p>I am currently working on a project that need to find and collect information about how to live cheap in Singapore. How to maximize the value of money by finding the right locations to shop cheap, eat cheap, to get cheap but good service, enjoy with minimum money spend, or some saving tips.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To define "cheap", it may not necessary be the lowest monetary amount, it may means "comparatively cheaper". Eg. a $30 steak is not cheap, but if the $30 steak is the cheapest in town when the nice set up and ambience element are taking into consideration.  Compartively the $30 is worth spending, then it can be considered "cheap". Or some restaurant may have some special promotion or discount during certain hours.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, I would like to seek your help here. If you have any "cheap lobangs", please drop me some information here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Secondly, if you have any saving tips, please don't mind sharing them here too.</p>
              <p>An example I can quote is: everytime we flush the toilet with full tank of water, even though we may not need to utilise so much of it. To save a bit of water, you can put a small bottle of water inside the tank, so the water fill in everytime is lesser. Thus, everytime you flush your toilet, some water is saved. This is what I learnt from an environmental talk...hehe...though I won't be able to tell exactly how much water can be saved, I guess it is still better than not doing anything...</p>

              <p>It depends, if you are cooking for yourself only, cooking at home is more expensive.     How cheap can it be in Singapore when the kind gahmen constant raise the cost of the living.</p>

              <p><br>How to define cheap?</p>
              <p>Eg if say this economy rice is $2 for  2 meat and 1 veggie choice, it is cheap. But it is located in Tuas. To go there to eat, you drive or take bus/taxi to eat but the cost of time, opportunity loss and your transport $$ spent already made that economy rice so much more expensive! </p>
              <p>Like sometimes people will queue up for half hour or more to eat a free plate of chicken rice, I would still say that is expensive because logically speaking if they worked for 1/2 hour, they would have gotten $2.50 and not forgetting the travel time, money spent on travelling etc. If they used that time to work, they would have earned more. Of course if your children is giving you money and you have nothing better to do, I agree that is cheap.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Best saving tips are recyling. Save money and save the environment.</p>
              <p>Eg. Plastic egg trays can be used as ice trays</p>

              <p>3) Dont throw away your TODAY newspaper and any unwanted papers such as magazine, letters, leaflet etc. Accumulate them and sell them to garang guni.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) Avoid buying things at shop at 7-11 or petrol kiosk</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5) Eat only 2 meals a day. Breakfast and Dinner.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>6) If you are driving, dont fill up the tank as it will mean extra weight for the car and higher fuel consumption. Please remember to remove unnecessary stuffs from the trunk.</p>

              <p>To live cheaply anywhere,</p>
              <p>1) go to council library, read newspapers and borrow books rather than buy. I discovered that I owned so many books that I have already read decades ago that I need space to store new ones. That's when, enuf oredi. Better borrow than buy cos once a book is read and pawed, I won't open nor look at it again.</p>
              <p>2) bring food from home. dunn buy from outside esp food centre (FC). FC food is expensive cos of the small serving, the cutleries may not be cleaned and proper. Only go to FC if desperate and you have "save" for at least 3 days from eating at FC. Consider this as a treat for your sanity and the need to surround yourself with clatter and people.</p>
              <p>3) buy your groceries after you compare the prices. Some stuff u can buy anywhere (back of the shop, HDB auntie shop or back of a truck) - like shampoo, soap, detergent, toilet paper and cleaning stuff. U dun care as long it works. But some stuff are a bit tricky, u must look for quality brand like facial moisturiser, deodorant, cooking oil, bread, milk and coffee. Other perishables stuff like fruit and vegie, buy only at cheap places and small quantity - shop n save, fair price at specials only. learn to know when their fresh stuff is delivered and strike at that hour.</p>
              <p>4) reduce your consumption of soft drinks and coffee bought from shop. Kopi from auntie uncle shop at 80 cents are OK once in a while but you should make your own coffee and put into a drink flask.</p>
              <p>5) YOu can make your own sandwich and eat for lunch rather than buy at Delifrance which cost an arm or a leg.</p>

              <p>Dear all,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>thanks for all the suggestions, it is very helpful :)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>secondly, i would like to ask for any specific shops or eatery places or shopping places that you would recommend?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>eg. I know you can buy very cheap and fresh salmon fish from a factory located in woodland's industrial area. their selling price is almost half of what you can get in supermarket.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>does anyone of you have this kind of lobangs?</p>
