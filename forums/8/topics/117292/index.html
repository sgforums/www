After all that is what the media, and your local church has spoon fed to the masses for years. Most people assume that Satanists embrace evil, arenÂ’t capable of loving, and that Satanism is nothing more than inverse Christianity. Nothing could be farther from the truth.<br><br>Satan by definition, it's true definition, is the Adversary, or the Opposition. We oppose the Status quo, and the closed minded herd mentality that fuels stupidity and ignorance like a social cancer. Instead we embrace Intellect, Objectivism, Individuality, and Rational self interest.<br><br>You are the only person who has control over your life, no "God" will make your life better for you. It is much like Santa Claus, we are told as children that if you don't believe in him you will be punished by not getting any presents. Religions of all kinds work in much the same way, with the exception of Satanism. We do not believe in things we cannot see, and yes that includes "Satan." Why should we, that is not rational.<br><br>I'm sure you are asking yourself, "Then why the name Satanism?" The answer is quite simple. Throughout history all religions have only preached obedience and faith while Individuality, and rational thought has been condemned and called Â“evilÂ”. It wasn't that long ago that the Churches attempted to ban books that provoke thought, and make people think for themselves instead of buying into the church scams and guilt trips. Satanism is quite the opposite, hence the term "Adversary" (The definition of Satan)<br><br><strong>A Crash Course History of Modern Satanism</strong><br>The Origin of Satanism is traced back thousands of years in various false forms. In some literature Satanism is regarded as a literal worship of various Demons and DeityÂ’s, other times it shows up as Witchcraft where practitioners make pacts with Satan and are thus granted their powers. Yet in other forms, Satanism is akin to Voodoo, and even ancient Pagans were regarded as Satanists who again were given powers by Â“Satan.Â” Nearly all of these cases are incorrect and had nothing to do with the true term Â“SatanÂ” or Modern Satanism.<br><br>Modern Satanism can only be traced back to 1966 when Anton LaVey shaved his head, performed a ritual and declared the formation of the Â“Church of Satan.Â” The religion (or anti-religion if you will) was composed as an answer to organized western religion and cultureÂ’s repression of natural instincts and desires.<br><br>Major influences of the Satanic Philosophy are as follows:<br><br>Â• The Magick of Aleister Crowley, and the works of the Abbey of Thelema.<br><br>Â• The Cynical anti-theistic viewpoints and writings of Friedrich Nietzsche<br><br>Â• The Objectivism philosophy of Ayn Rand<br><br>Â• The Comical and Social viewpoint of people like P.T. Barnum<br><br>Â• The brutal reality of Ragnard RedbeardÂ’s writings.<br><br>Prior to LaVey forming the Church of Satan, LaVey in the early to mid sixties would hold Midnight Masses at his Victorian home in the San FranciscoÂ’s Richmond District. It would attract many high profile figures from the San Francisco area which made LaVey somewhat of a local legend. This is what caused LaVey to start the Â“Satanic ChurchÂ” later renamed the Â“Church of SatanÂ” (often referred to Â“CoSÂ” for short).<br><br>In 1969 LaVey wrote the Satanic Bible which would prove to be the bedrock for modern Satanism. To date it has sold nearly 1,000,000 copies world wide and has been translated into several languages.<br><br>The Church of Satan thrived vigorously in the late sixties and early seventies attracting many celebrities including Sammy Davis Jr., and Jayne Mansfield to name a few.<br><br>In 1975 many changes occurred within the CoS, LaVey had done away with the Grotto system. A network of sub-churches setup across the country. Some structural re-organization had also been done.<br><br>It was at this time that Michael Aquino, member of the Church of Satan, broke away from the Church and formed his Â“Temple of Set.Â” Aquino maintained that LaVey had changed his stance from believing in an actual Satan to referring to it as more of a relative term. LaVey claimed that he had always referred to Satan as a Â“Dark force of NatureÂ” rather than an actual deity.<br><br>Between 1970 and 1992 LaVey had written three other books. The Compleat Witch (Re-released as Â“The Satanic Witch), The Satanic Rituals, and The DevilÂ’s Notebook.<br><br>During this period in the Â‘80Â’s there was a wave of Satanic panic as many talk shows, news media, and various papers across the country began reporting on Satanic Serial Killers, and Groups of Satanists that were opening day care centers, molesting, and sacrificing children. This sparked an FBI investigation which concluded that there was no such activity taking place.<br><br>Just after the release of the DevilÂ’s Notebook in 1992 LaVey made a film entitled Â“Speak of the DevilÂ” It was a documentary about the Anton LaVey, the history of Satanism, and the Church of Satan. It seemed to revive the Satanic movement a little but not nearly as much as it was in 1996.<br><br>A musician by the name of Marilyn Manson release an album entitled Â“Antichrist SuperstarÂ” which fueled a pop-culture trend of Goth teenagers proclaiming to be Satanists. Many of these children were nothing more than alienated teens who were simply rebelling against religion, and their parents.<br><br>This created a surge of attention for LaVey and the Church of Satan. A revitalized church had sky rocketing membership applications and a renewed interest in Satanism. Ironically in the midst of the Goth culture phenomenon LaVey would die of heart failure in his home on the night of Oct. 27, 1997.<br><br><strong>The Aftermath of LaVeyÂ’s Death</strong><br><br>Not surprisingly the death of LaVey created a frenzy in and outside of the Satanic community. Detractors came out from rocks to demystify, or debunk nearly all parts of LaVeyÂ’s personal and private life, and of course the Church of Satan itself.<br><br>Karla LaVey (AntonÂ’s eldest daughter) and Blanche Barton (LaVeyÂ’s Biographer, and mother of his Son) had agreed to run the Church together as co-High PriestessÂ’s. It was just after this agreement that Blanche produced a handwritten will and claimed that Church, LaVeyÂ’s personal property, and all rights to LaVeyÂ’s writings were the sole property of Blanche, and LaVeyÂ’s youngest Son Xerxes.<br><br>Karla had contested the will citing a Doctors statement that LaVey was heavily medicated and had just come out of a death experience when he was coerced to write the Will. The Will was later invalidated and an agreement was made.<br><br>Feeling that her fathers personal items were more important than the organization itself Karla agreed to let Blanche have the Â“Organization known as Church of SatanÂ” in return LaVeyÂ’s three children were to equally divide his personal belongings, and the rights to his works.<br><br>During this time Blanche and clergy of the Church had began a vicious campaign against Karla claiming she had not contributed to the Church, and went through long periods of not speaking to her father.<br><br>In reality Karla LaVey had gone on numerous lecture tours at UniversityÂ’s regarding Satanism. Appeared on countless television talk shows and radio interviews, promoting the Church, her fatherÂ’s work, and the philosophy itself. She was even featured on the Cover of BrazilÂ’s most popular magazine giving an interview on the Satanism, and the Occult.<br><br>Karla then decided to form the Â“First Satanic ChurchÂ” in 1999, an identical organization to her fathers old Church in order to carry on the family tradition. Her church is operating out of San Francisco just as her father had run the Church of Satan.<br><br>Blanche currently resides in San Diego, California where the Church of Satan is run mostly online, while still maintaining the P.O. Box in San Francisco.<br><br>A large number of new Satanic Churches have popped up since the death of LaVey in 1997. Most of them internet based and lacking any real substance. That just seems to be par for the course these days.<br><br><strong>A Word about Satanism Today</strong><br><br>Satanism has always been about being an individual, it therefore makes sense that regardless of organizational politics the primary focus should be on the individual. It has become a bit cliche yet it still hold true that you do not have to join any organization to be a Satanist. Only you can determine where you want to go in life.<br><br>In closing I would like to say that Satanism is the Bedrock philosophy of human existence. It is the philosophy that is your primer paint before you put several layers of other paints on the wall. It is the first stepping stone in life's journey for infinite knowledge. In the long run it's really what keeps you grounded and your head out of the clouds.<br><br>I would encourage you to do your own research and studying on the subjects of Satanism &amp; the Occult Sciences.<br></blockquote>Quite informative, we can even start our Church of Satan here <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
