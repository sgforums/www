            <div class='col-md body'>anyway, just to be on topic, satanists just simply don't believe there is a "right" and "wrong", just do whatever you like and endulge your fantasty *in this case, for a certain retard, racing video cars*<br><br>they don't believe in a hell to go to,<br><br>and i read in a book that satanism was rather popular at one stage of time, because everyone likes the idea of free sex. i forgot which period of time anyway.<br><br>but well, if you guys want to listen and follow someone who's reality is in a fantasy manga world, and thinks he is a manga character who can race cars, then go ahead. i personally thinks he's 2 bricks short of a wall, so i'll follow what i deem as the truth.<br><br></div>
