            <div class='col-md body'><br>Read this story and you may find that what you are<br>&gt; always hoping to achieve, you may already have it.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; There was once an American businessman who was<br>&gt; sitting by the beach in a small Mexican village. As he sat,<br>&gt; he saw a Mexican fisherman rowing a small boat towards<br>&gt; the shore and noticed that the fisherman has caught<br>&gt; quite a number of big fishes that is known to be a<br>&gt; delicacy. The American was really impressed and ask<br>&gt; the fisherman,"How long does it take you to catch so many fishes?"<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The fisherman reply; "Oh, just a short while."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Then why don't you stay longer at sea and you<br>&gt; could catch even more?"<br>&gt; The businessman was astonished.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The fisherman simply does not agree, "This is<br>&gt; enough to feed my whole family?" he says.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The businessman then asked: " So, what do you do<br>&gt; for the rest of the day then? "<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The fisherman reply; "Well, I usually wake up early<br>&gt; in the morning, go out to sea and catch a few fishes,<br>&gt; then I would go back and play with my kids. In the<br>&gt; afternoon, I will take a nap with my wife, and<br>&gt; evening comes, I will join my buddies in the village for a<br>&gt; drink, we played guitar, sing and dance throughout<br>&gt; the night. My day was ever so complete and carefree.?"<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The businessman does not agree with his way of life<br>&gt; and offered a suggestion to the fisherman.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "I am a PhD holder graduated from Harvard<br>&gt; University, specialises in business management. I could help<br>&gt; you to become a more successful person. From now on,<br>&gt; you have to spend more time at sea and try to catch as<br>&gt; many fishes as possible. And when you have save<br>&gt; enough money, you could buy a bigger boat and catch even<br>&gt; more fishes. As you go on, you will be able to afford to<br>&gt; buy more boats, recruit more fishermen and lead a<br>&gt; team of your own. Soon you will be able to set-up your<br>&gt; own company, your very own production plant for canned<br>&gt; food and do direct selling to your distributors. At<br>&gt; that time, you will have moved out of this village<br>&gt; and to Mexico city, and then expand your operation to<br>&gt; LA, and finally to New York city, where you can set-up<br>&gt; your HQ to manage all your other branches."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The fisherman asks, "So, how long would that take?"<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The businessman reply: "About 15 to 20 years"<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The fisherman continued, "And after that?"<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The businessman laugh heartily, " After that, you<br>&gt; can live like a king in your own house, and when the<br>&gt; time is right, you can go public and float your shares<br>&gt; in the Stock Exchange, by then you will be rich, your<br>&gt; income will be coming in by the millions!!"<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The fisherman ask, "And after that?"<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The businessman says "After that, you can finally<br>&gt; retire, you can move to a house by the fishing<br>&gt; village, wake up early in the morning and catch a<br>&gt; few fishes, then return home to play with the kids,<br>&gt; have a nice afternoon nap with your wife, and when evening<br>&gt; comes, you can join your buddies for a drink, play<br>&gt; the guitar, sing and dance throughout the night!!"<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The fisherman was puzzled, "Isn't that what I am<br>&gt; doing now??"<br>&gt;<br>&gt; So, what does one really hope to achieve in life,<br>&gt; do we really need to work so hard in life? What do<br>&gt; you hope to accomplish in the end? ...<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Expect the unexpected...<br>Have A Happy Day!<br></div>
