              <p>at least they dont any how suck ang moh d$cks like some from a particular group do.</p>
              <p>most of them will marry a man if they like him. if they like him its the final word. It doesnt matter if the guy has 5Cs or not. Indian girls marry for love, not money. because thats the culture.</p>
              <p>Though i agree some indian men as with the the case of all men marry other races like chinese for the love of money or sex . But they are men. Men , from any race will always have ulteriror motives.</p>

              <p>nothing wrong with kaimar post, but those racist here just spoil it.I remember these beauties specially the famous 2. the rest not heard of. the diya mirza whover is so beautiful from the pics. its my pleasure to meet them. these are extremely beautiful women in their heydays i believe ruled the movie and modelling industry and some rocked Hollywood as well too..</p>
              <p>some claim they get fat and all..dont be disullusioned. Women fom wherever they are , ang  moh not spared will age faster and need to take care of their bodies. if they dont, they will become trash meant to be discarded. Their husbands will  leave them for other younger women.</p>
              <p>But i do agree with kaimar about the part where indian gals being more loyal. yes they are, some bad apples as elsewhere may exist but confirmed they are more loyal than chinese or malay gals, as  much as i know . they stick with their man once their mind is made up. Theirs being small community, word of reputation will spread faster , so need to take care of their name.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> dont listen to this teen angel7030, her views are shallow and immature as her age. her posts in speaker's corner attacking uncles. angel7030, u wan to  attack uncles issit? We are attractive men who still draw chics but probbaly u will grow to be a unwanted trash after past age 30. probably she is born in the 1990s and ladies and teen girls or celebrities were much prettier and classier back then. She doesn know it</p>
