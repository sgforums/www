Especially if you're running for all you can to board a train that is going to arrive / had arrived upstairs. Esp with a bunch of fat barrel type asses slowly walking and blocking your way yah. I hate it when I'm rushing for work, then at the walking pavement of the shophouses, there's these group of aunties blocking our way by stopping to look at the "pasar malam" stalls outside the shophouse. Or simply more irritating.. these round aunties walk left when you walk left trying to overtake them.. walk right when you walk right.. and in the end still blocking your way with their slow walking and pushing their shopping carts to market. Arghh.. simply irritating. They no need to work and rush like siao to reach workplace punctuality leh. But we have to leh.</div>

Or because simply they have the selfish mindset "not my problem what". They're so irritating especially when we're rushing for time and train has arrived or coming in the next sec. Oh ya, I hate it when the whole of left side on the upgoing escalator is full, and suddenly there's one extra on the right side of the escalator. That fellow never read the "keep left" sign when go up? Wa lao have to use gongfu to pass through the less than 20cm gap in between the left and right person share on the same escalator step.</div>
