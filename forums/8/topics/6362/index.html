            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with Asure. Go and retake O'levels. Though private institutions are a cheaper alternative, some are really crap and all they are after is your money. I've worked in one before (can't tell you which one but suprisingly, it's quite well-known) and you can't believe the way the so called academics there juggle the decision between quality education and a business decision where the bottom line is money.<br><br>If you're looking to see which direction you should go, imagine 5-10 years ahead. I have a friend who is a shipping lawyer. Good choice cos it's a recession proof job. Moreover, my friend just got blessed cos foreign firms are coming in and even a first year legal assistant's pay can be as high as SGD3,900!!<br><br>All the best.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>NaiveGirl:<br>To give u a rough idea of SG Education system.<br>Kids start schooling in kindergarten, which is about 2 or 3 yrs<br>Afterwhich, they move on to Primary School whereby they spend about 6 yrs. At the end of 6 yrs, they will take the PSLE which will determine the stream that they will take -- Express or Normal.<br>Express - 4 yrs; Normal - 5 yrs<br>Next they move on to Secondary level, (by then they r around 13 yrs old). In the secondary level they will undergo 4 yrs (or 5) and take their GCE 'O' Levels at Secondary 4 (or 5). This is a very basic &amp; important qualification in which I feel is very crucial in SG. Without the O's cert, it is very difficult to survive in SG (Please dun flame me, coz this is only how I feel)<br>After which students can decide whether they want to start working or to continue studying.<br>Now they will have to make the choice of where/wat to study if they chose the later path. There r several choices:<br>1) Junior College (A Levels)<br>2) Polytechnic (Diploma)<br>3) Private Institutions<br>4) Overseas Studies<br>Usually for 1) they would complete in 2 yrs then move on to University for Degree and for 2) they will complete in 3 yrs and start working after that. Again this is depends on individual.<br>Whew, hopefully this gives you a better idea of the SG education system.<br>Anyone wants to add anything that I missed? or disagree with wat I wrote?<br><br>------------------<br>Fiddle Dee Dee! I will not think about it now, I will think about it tomorrow!</div>
