            <div class='col-md body'>Polytechnic was NEVER inferior to JC education. In fact a polytechnic education is much better than a JC education if we are comparing just at that. However the complication is that a University education is much better than a polytechnic's. Please dun flame me on this. If you are working, u will know this to be very true. If you are not, u will find out soon enuff.. now that's where the complication arises because it is much easier to get into University via a JC route than via a Poly route. That is why more people chose the JC path, hoping to make it to the University.<br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That's right. I feel that poly students are more streetwise. I was an instructor last time with BMTC. I was involved with all those new soldiers.Trust me, JC students are damn blur and ignorant, unlike poly students who are slightly ahead in terms of their awareness and adaption to a new environment.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>mAke luRvE`~ not wAR..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>some of my friends chose to go to poly 'cos they wanted to skip GP in jc !!! in the end, it took them a huge amount of effort just to make it to Uni from poly. some of them didn't even make it, and regretted their choice of poly. however, a poly cert is considered a poly cert and can earn you a professional salary. an 'a' level cert is no different from an 'o' level cert.<br>i came from a jc, and i can say it's very easy to make it to a university from a jc.<br><br>anyway, to answer the topic's question. a jc is consider pre-university education - that is, it prepares you for further education in the university. a poly is an instituition where you get professional qualifications, where you are trained in specific areas. it's wrong to even ask "whether poly education is inferior to jc education".<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well this topic has resurrected haha. Lemme say my few cents worth of opinion. Long time ago during or even before my era, Poly route was created to ensure that those people who can't make it to JC. They (gahmen) must be thinking since academic studies is not really your forte, why not train you to learn to do hands on stuff in Poly which are more practical and industry based. University education are more academic and research in nature.<br><br>However, as times passes by, some employers (private sector) in the working industry value the work rate and hands on skills Poly graduates can offer and then slowly Poly education rise in prominence and that cause some exodus of potential JC students to turn to Poly in order to have more chance of employment after graduation.<br><br>Now currently, this distinction is getting blurred as I know nowadays University are also pretty much focusing on hands on skills although they will still nurtue academic talents to do research in future?<br><br>My feel? Say in a ficticious company of strength 10, for a company to do well, I need maybe 1-3 academically inclined people but at least 7 people to do the implementation. But if I can make those 1 - 3 to do also implementation, it will be ideal.
