            <div class='col-md body'>Just recieved this in my mailbox and i would like to share this joke with u guys<br><br><blockquote><span style="color: blue;">--info removed--</span><br><br>URGENT BUSINESS ASSISTANCE<br><br>I do recognize the surprise this urgent but confidential letter will bring to you especially as it came from a stranger, but rest assured that it came with best of intentions. First. I must introduce myself. I am Mr.Michael Kante from the diamond-rich district of Sierra Leone and my father was the former Special adviser to the ousted Head of State of Sierra Leone, Major Johnny Paul Koroma. I got your address and other details from the International Chamber of Commerce here in South Africa.<br><br>During the war between our forces led by the Ex-Head of State, Major Johnny Koroma and the west African Allied Forces (ECOMOG), my country relied heavily on foreign earnings generated from diamond trade. This money was personally kept by the then President, Major Johnny Paul Koroma since our banking system had collapsed during the war. However, as the war progressed, it became apparent that we were going to loose the war to the superior and better armed West African Allied Forces (ECOMOG).<br><br>At this point, the key officers of the administration started making frantic efforts on how to leave Sierra Leone safely thereby sharing the proceeds/money from this diamond trade. In view of the fact that my father was one of the key officers of the then administration and an In-law to Major Paul Koroma, he succeeded in getting the sum of US$20.5 Million (Twenty Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars).<br><br>We made arrangement and transferred the money through diplomatic means to South Africa, where I am presently living in exile as an asylum seeker but unfortunately, my father died of heart attack after a few months of exile in South Africa and automatically, I came in total control of the said money as the only surviving son. Upon our arrival in South Africa after due consideration, we deposited the money with a Security Company for security reasons. The actual content was not disclosed to them (Security Company) pending when we see a trust worthy person who will assist us in transferring this money to his account outside South Africa, as the strict Monetary laws here do not allow asylum seekers certain financial rights.<br><br>I shall be most grateful if you can assist me accomplish this transaction and hoping too that you will remain trustworthy. For your efforts and assistance, I have agreed to give you 20% of the total sum while 10% will be set aside for all the expenses incurred in the course of this transaction.<br><br>The rest of the 70% will be for my family investment in your country. Please, note that I have made arrangements for a successful deal. As such, the only thing I ask from you is total assistance to transfer this money, complete trust and assurance that my own part of the money will be safe when transferred to your account. I would also wish you kept this proposal highly confidential and secret considering my fatherÂ’s position before his death and the source of the money.<br><br>If you are interested in assisting me, Please contact me through the above telephone number as soon as possible,Thanking you in advance for your anticipated co-operation.<br><br>Yours faithfully,<br><br>Mr.Michael Kante<br></blockquote></div>
