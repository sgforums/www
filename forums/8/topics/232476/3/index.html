Creativity and imagination are all that helps.<br>IMHO, the best way to learn english is by interacting with people who speak good, proper english.<br>I wonder why some people get their language foundation corrupted by peer pressure/influence.

Stories are easier to score than argumentative essays, imho. You just need an arsenal of vocabulary, and a teeny bit of creative juice.<br><br>Argumentative essays require making your stand, quoting evidence etc to support your stand, and sufficient command of the language to put your thoughts into words, which isn't really as easy as it sounds.<br><br>If I had any choice, I'd be writing stories when I was still in JC, hah.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wow, there is really a lot of disheartening comments.<br><br>Although i never read finish the whole thing, i manage to glance through the first paragraph.<br><br>And it can be seen that u did attempt to use a higher level of vocabulary, that is a plus point. Also, i assume that u are still under the cambridge syllabus. So, the plot can be simple and predictable, a fanciful one will lead to more mistakes.<br><br>Cambridge markers have a very huge emphasis on the grammar usage, so try to cut down on that. And never go out of point.<br><br>If you have accomplish these things, you should be able to pass. Read more storybooks to improve your english.</div>
