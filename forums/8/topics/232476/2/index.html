It was that of a monster which entered my paradise. He pierced my ears with his thunderous roar and was starting to turn my dream into a nightmare. <strong> I was suddenly jostled awake </strong> by my classmate. My teacher was staring at me , his eyes filled with fury. He had caught me sleeping during his lesson again. <strong> (relate it back to the topic again) </strong><br><br>I was sleeping in class is all because of my work in McDonald that week. My stall don't have enough crew, and called me to go back to help them. Although I had a choice to not to work that day, I chose to help my manager.<br><br>I was lacking sleep because I worked the night shift, from sunset till dawn. Sleep deprived, I went straight to school after work. A few teachers suggested kindly that I quit my work because it was affecting my studies. However , I had to earn my own pocket money to pay for bills such as mobile and internet subscriptions because my family could not afford such luxuries. <strong> (That is one heck of a lousy reason - no money don't get mobile or internet subscription) </strong><br><br>At first, it was easy to balance my study with work. I had only needed to work for two days per week. However, my outlet faced shortage of crew and I had to work everyday of that week.<br><br>It was after my end of year exams, so my worries about my studies was forgotten for that year. Life felt horrible that week.  I was so exhausted after work that I started to fall asleep without knowing it . My teacher was keeping tabs on me. Each time he saw me sleeping , he would roar at me at that opportune moment, snapping me out of my dreamland. Coffee was the only substance keeping me awake. <strong> ( write more abut coffee - and the feeling each time you drink it down)</strong><br><br>It was torturous battling my heavy eyelids in order to keep my bloodshot eyes open.  I was only allowed a peaceful sleep for two hours each day. After that precious two hours, i had to start my work at Macdonalds. My manager was nasty <strong>(expand on how nasty )</strong>. I also met unreasonable customers. I tried my hardest to keep on going.<br><br>After the third day of this torture, i couldn't take it anymore. I work with my eyes half closed, serving all the unreasonable customers with their unreasonable requests they wanted. I was trying my best to reach the 'sixty second each customer' target with my last bit of energy.<br><br>It was the toughest battle i ever fought in my life. It was more tiring than any physical training I have went through. I felt very unappreciated. My workplace just do not notice the efforts I have made to assist them in the time of a staff shortage. They even scolded me for being slow in my service and not paying attention to the needs of my fellow colleagues. I was not asking for much but a thankyou would have been nice instead of scoldings I received.<br><br><strong> (Add on what you actually did in a shift , the unfairness u received etc etc)</strong><br><br>The End<br><br>i got 450 word but the my teacher wants it 500 at least. i add alot of boring things inside to make the compo longer liao... but still not enough... and i think my ending sux... anyone can help plz? or if can add me in msn and teach me... my msn is libraoct@hotmail.com [/b]</blockquote>I suggest you concentrate on your grammar and sentence structure . It's abit whacked.<br>Plus you are going out of topic with the first paragraph .. you need to bring it in line with your compo . It still feels abit disjointed when I read it.  I agree with your teachers - quit your work. You need to concentrate on english.<br>I corrected as much as I could but I won't do your homework for you.</div>

It was that of a monster which entered my paradise. He let out a thunderous roar, which pierced my ears and started the transition of my dream into a nightmare. <span style="font-style: italic;">(wtf, lol)</span> I was suddenly jostled awake by my classmate. My teacher was staring at me, his eyes gleaming with fury. He had caught me sleeping during his lesson again. (relate it back to the topic again)<br><br>I slept in class all because of my work in McDonald that week. As my stall didn't have enough crew, I was called back to help. Although I had a choice not to work that day, I chose to help my manager.<br><br>I was lacking sleep because I worked the night shift, from sunset till dawn. Sleep deprived, I went straight to school after work. A few teachers kindly suggested that I quit my work as it was affecting my studies. However , I had to earn my own money to pay for bills such as mobile and internet subscriptions because my family could not afford such luxuries.<br><br>At first, it was easy to balance my study with work. I had only needed to work for two days per week. However, my outlet faced shortage of crew and I had to work everyday of that week.<br><br>It was after my final exams, so my worries about my studies were forgotten for that year. Life felt horrible that week. I was so exhausted after work that I started to fall asleep without knowing it . My teacher was keeping tabs on me. Each time he saw me sleeping , he would roar at me at that opportune moment, snapping me out of my dreamland. Coffee was the only substance keeping me awake.<br><br>It was torturous battling my heavy eyelids in order to keep my bloodshot eyes open. I was only allowed a peaceful sleep of two hours each day. After that precious two hours, I had to start my work at Macdonalds. My manager was nasty. I also met unreasonable customers. I tried my hardest to keep on going.<br><br>After the third day of this torture, I couldn't take it anymore. I worked with my eyes half-closed, serving all the unreasonable customers with their unreasonable requests. I was trying my best to reach the 'sixty second each customer' target with my last bit of energy.<br><br>It was the toughest battle I ever fought in my life. It was more tiring than any physical training I ever went through. I felt very unappreciated. My workplace did not notice the efforts I had made to assist them in the time of a staff shortage. They even scolded me for being slow in my service and not paying attention to the needs of my fellow colleagues. I was not asking for much but a 'thank you' would have been nice instead of the scoldings I received.<br></div></blockquote>Mmmm, took fymk's editted copy, and did more minor grammar corrections, not that it really helped much. I'd like to remind you that if you wish to use past-tense, then don't start using present tense at the latter part of the story. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
