            <div class='col-md body'>can someone help me out with this?<br>i got a compo which i need help as i am really bad in english...<br>can anyone help me edit it or saw any mistake like grammer or spelling mistake of mine? thx in advance.<br><br>the question for this compo is : write about a time when you gave your hard work but it was not appreciated.<br><br>k here it goes....<br><br>I felt a pair of evil and angry eyes staring at me. It was that of a monster which entered my paradise. He let out a thunderous roar, which pierced my ears and started the transition of my dream into a nightmare. I was suddenly jostled awake by my classmate. My teacher was staring at me, his eyes gleaming with fury. He had caught me sleeping during his lesson again.<br><br>I slept in class all because of my work in McDonald that week. As my stall didn't have enough crew, I was called back to help. Although I had a choice not to work that day, I chose to help my manager.<br><br>I was lacking sleep because I worked the night shift, from sunset till dawn. Sleep deprived, I went straight to school after work. A few teachers kindly suggested that I quit my work as it was affecting my studies. However , I had to earn my own money to pay for bills such as mobile and internet subscriptions because my family could not afford such luxuries.<br><br>At first, it was easy to balance my study with work. I had only needed to work for two days per week. However, my outlet faced shortage of crew and I had to work everyday of that week.<br><br>It was after my final exams, so my worries about my studies were forgotten for that year. Life felt horrible that week. I was so exhausted after work that I started to fall asleep without knowing it . My teacher was keeping tabs on me. Each time he saw me sleeping , he would roar at me at that opportune moment, snapping me out of my dreamland. Coffee was the only substance keeping me awake.<br><br>It was torturous battling my heavy eyelids in order to keep my bloodshot eyes open. I was only allowed a peaceful sleep of two hours each day. After that precious two hours, I had to start my work at McDonald. My manager was nasty. I also met unreasonable customers. I tried my hardest to keep on going.<br><br>After the third day of this torture, I couldn't take it anymore. I worked with my eyes half-closed, serving all the unreasonable customers with their unreasonable requests. I was trying my best to reach the 'sixty second each customer' target with my last bit of energy.<br><br>It was the toughest battle I ever fought in my life. It was more tiring than any physical training I ever went through. I felt very unappreciated. My workplace did not notice the efforts I had made to assist them in the time of a staff shortage. They even scolded me for being slow in my service and not paying attention to the needs of my fellow colleagues.<br><br>Till this day, I still feel very unappreciated. My workplace seemed to not notice the efforts I had made to assist them in the time of a staff shortage. They seemed to take my efforts for granted. If not for me, I bet that particular restaurant would have closed down long ago. I was not asking for much but more 'thank-you's would have been nice instead of the incessant scoldings I received.<br><br>Indeed, humans often reprimand people for bad things they did.<br>When things goes the way they think it should, they would not be praising the people who made that possible, but instead, take it for granted.<br><br>The End<br><br>i got 450 word but the my teacher wants it 500 at least. i add alot of boring things inside to make the compo longer liao... but still not enough... and i think my ending sux... anyone can help plz? or if can add me in msn and teach me... my msn is libraoct@hotmail.com<br><br>- last edited by combining a few people edited... hmm... i guess ok liao... very very good liao... any further my teacher will consider me cheating liao...</div>
