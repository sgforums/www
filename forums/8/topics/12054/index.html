            <div class='col-md body'>There's no doubt tat to progress in this society, u need to have connections. Whether it is the right,wrong or simply ethical ones is usually for others to decide.<br><br>The truth is nowadays, "connection" has stretched to just abt every other thing. Merit and ability doesn't always count anymore, whether in the workplace or in extra activities or staying in a hall for that matter. Becoz of this, ppl begin to backstab others to eliminate the competition and incite anger and hatred. Friends become enemies.<br><br>The result is that the victimised suffer something that is undeserved.<br><br>And the ppl in charge simply shrug it off as a obvious problem but one they say is outta their hands. "It'll always exist" they say.<br><br>The ugly truth hurts indeed....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tat's the problem nowadays...<br><br>Whatever happened to the old system where ppl based their judgements on merit and ability? When i served in NS, i was under a young Major who was extremely frank..even when speaking with superiors...nobody dared to mess with him but his superiors hated his guts. Yet, despite his attitude and bluntness, he still survived becoz of two things:<br><br>1. He was always right...(yes always)<br>2. He had enemies but also many frens in high places too...though he seldom used them.<br><br>He was a scrupulous guy and after u got to know him, he was quite a reasonable man...<br><br>I admired him for his vision and accuracy; this confounded many ppl as  they never realised that someone as stubborn as him could be right all the time!<br><br>This is something i feel is missing nowadays...ppl just use the "connection" rather than count on their own abilities...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>well good 4 ur major then!! pp like these are so hard to find nowadays - who really attempt to get where they want to go through using their compentencies - instead of through their connections...<br><br>There's only a few things that we can do about such stuff - let's just face it - the world IS like that - it IS unfair...<br><br>1) Complain about them - whether to friends, "semi-publicly" (like in this forum), or "real publicly".<br><br>2) Ignore them - and try to live with it. Accept things for what they are. (hard to do..depending on personality oso)<br><br>3) Join them (ie. "become" one of them) (yeeeucks!!!)<br><br>4) Strive to be different - and only work out your achievements/recognition through your own abilities (up to individual and circumstances - sometimes no matter how hard you try, you only get more frustrated only!!)<br><br>Whichever path you choose to take, it's all up to you. But let me just state for fairness's sake - i believe we should never keep totally quiet and stay away from choice no. 1 all the time. Cos if we do, we will only be letting all the anger and everything build up inside. Sometimes it's good to let it all out too!! (like what we're all doing here...)<br><br>and lastly, a "last" interesting way (may or may not work - depending on the situation)<br><br>5) band with all those in your situation who feel the same way as you - and are equally frustrated about things. Work to expose these people for who they are, and show them for the incompetent (if they are that) people that they are.<br><br>A warning though - you better make sure who you're cooperating with in this last one - and make sure they will stick together with you once anything happens!!<br></div>
