There are only 2 blocks of 5-room flats with limited units (100 units) but tons of 4-room flats (650 units). In my area, 3- and 4-room flats make up the majority of the population.

It may seem unfair, but as Singaporeans, citizens of the country, it is only right that we enjoy such privileges in our very own homeland. So, why is it that under SERS, PR owners can get in line with Singapore citizens???<br>The system is not fair at all.</div>

              <p>I am a Singaporean and due to some red tape, I am treated same as you, a PR - no benefits, nothing. <br><br>On top of that, I have to fork out 80,000 to 100,000 more than my neighbour in order to get my new house. Not to mention another 30,000 for my renovation next yr when I get my key.  <br><br>I served NS, I serve my reservist duties and I don't come here to bitch like the way you did.</p>

              <p>PRs and Singapore citizens enjoying the same privileges, that's as fair as you can get already.</p>
              <p>It's only not fair when you insisted for extra privileges for Singaporeans or PRs.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <div style="margin-bottom: 3px;">
              <div><strong>Hi all,<br> <br> If ur house is under SERS (SELECTIVE EN BLOC REDEVELOPMENT SCHEME),
                  better beware especially if u're living in a 5-room flat. Last year
                  my block was announced en-bloc. My parents really liked the area
                  alot as it is a quiet neighbourhood with great neighbours in our
                  block of only 80 households.<br> But our peace and dream of continuing to stay in a 5-room flat was
                  destroyed as the so-called Computer Balloting System placed us on
                  the last 5th day of the selection of flats. There are only 2 blocks
                  of 5-room flats with limited units (100 units) but tons of 4-room
                  flats (650 units). In my area, 3- and 4-room flats make up the
                  majority of the population. Under the SERS, they can choose to
                  upgrade to 5-room and with the compensation, most of them would
                  only have to top up a small amount, if not none at all, to get a
                  good 5-room flat!<br> Currently, almost all the 5-room flats have been snapped up. Reason
                  being the balloting system have put all these people who chose to
                  upgrade with us, the original 5-room owners. It is extremely unfair
                  for us, as we do not have a choice to upgrade and originally we are
                  already living in 5-room flats but yet we are unable to be continue
                  living in such a flat.<br> As we all know, PR (Permanent Residents) does not have certain
                  privileges when it comes to housing matters. For example, they are
                  unable to buy a new flat under HDB and they need to fork out more
                  money compared to Singapore Citizens when there are upgradings such
                  as addition of lifts et cetera. It may seem unfair, but as
                  Singaporeans, citizens of the country, it is only right that we
                  enjoy such privileges in our very own homeland. So, why is it that
                  under SERS, PR owners can get in line with Singapore
                  citizens???<br> The system is not fair at all.</strong></div>
