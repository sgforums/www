            <div class='col-md body'>Derek:<br><br>Yes, Indeed the world is not flat.  Once everyone on earth believed that the world is flat...except for a few and they had immense drive to stand alone facing the world telling the world that they are all wrong.  Very brave indeed!  Why is it that at the end they have succeed?!  Because it is only the truth that the world itself is not flat to begin with...<br><br>You are right, just because 10 people say one thing that doesn't make that one thing right or conformed, but you know...at the end the truth will always win...No one knows what is the truth now, and only in time we can tell...Maybe pointing figures is wrong, but everyone has their right for their own opinion...no matter how is it...at the end the truth will always shine through.<br><br>"It is just one person's understanding from the life he has led....can you flame him for his experience? He may have learnt and moved on... where the rest are here pointing fingers... self-righteousness..."<br><br>hmmm....Say, there was a person, he has grew up in a very violent family and society...he became violent himself... Indeed only himself can understand the life he has led.  Then one day, he was proven guilty for murder.  Does that make it right or okie for him to do such thing just because of the life he had?!  No rt?!  Athough he has been through a lot of violent incidents in his life, he has a mind of his own, he shld have thought abt many things before he taken the action.  He shld be able to tell the difference between right and wrong.<br><br>I may not agree with your opinion, but i will defend to the death your right to your wrong opinion!!!<br><br>Once again... *NaiveGirl sticks her tongue out*<br><br>hiak! hiak! haik!<br><br>------------------<br>Float like a butterfly...Sting like a bee...</div>
