Not what you do.<br>When the thief who was crucified alongside Jesus, had faith and asked Jesus to accept him into heaven, Jesus DID NOT SAY TO HIM,"GET DOWN FROM THE CROSS AND DO SOME GOOD WORK", instead Jesus told the theif that "Today you shall be with Me in Paradise".<br>FAITH saves us, becos no amount of good works you do, can ever save you.<br>becos measured against God's standards, your good works are nothing. not even kachang puteh. nuts.<br><br>i always have NEVER condoned Christian evangelism gatherings to masquerade as something else.<br>that is not honest.<br>i hope i hv answered ur questions.<br><br>N to ur last statement, if u r interested to learn from the Bible on how to be a good person, let me tell u that the Bible reccommends many commandments for mankind to follow.<br>but u know what?<br>it says that no matter how good man thinks he is, his goodness will never exceed his wickedness. n that is true.<br>we all hv our deepest darkest sins.<br>every1 of us.<br>only God is good. Jesus Himself said, "no one is good, save God alone."<br>the Bible is not a bk to teach u abt how to live ur life well, u can take it as that, but u will MISS OUT on its main message, which is that, all men need the one and only God, and through Jesus Christ alone, can our sins be forgiven, for no works are ever enough.<br>no need for me to define work to u, becos whatever way u choose to define it, it is still not good or many enough for God.<br><br></div>

In fact, h pointed out the truth.<br>NUMBER THREE,the focus of the Bible is the bringing of the good news. the portion that u claim to be abt the way to live ur life, exists in the LAW, but it'd only tell u more than what i've said, abt how wrong u all are. and how we as mankind have always led sinful lives.n of course, as a result we need God's graciousness all the more.<br>NUMBER FOUR, no, forgiveness is no excuse to committ sins. it is shocking how people can never understand this.<br>think abt it, if ur mother forgives u for stealing all the time, IS A VALID EXCUSE to go around stealing continuously? of course not, forgiveness must be appreciated and treasured by upholding this trust that has been given to u, so that u must try not to steal anymore!!!!!<br>NUMBER FIVE, u dont even know God. so dont talk on His behalf. Me? I do. I know Him, I know my Savior and my LORD. n I speak for Him. u? u hvnt even read His Word.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm not a Buddhist.  I'm a free thinker.  I was just giving an example there -&gt; see <strong>(for eg)</strong> in my posting.<br><br>I'm a freethinker because my mind isn't on spiritual things yet.  I'm just busy and concerned about other things now.<br><br>But frankly, even if I'm a buddhist, I don't think I'd be reading the Buddhist scriptures.  They are written in an archaic form - I wouldn't be able to understand them.  Unless with years of devote study.<br><br>Btw, if you are hoping to convince anyone to your side, I think you are not moving anywhere near that.  At least for me, that is.  Before me, I see an over-zealous fellow, who's trying to put everything else down.<br><br>Well, I guess it's also hard for you lah.  Your religion maintains that everyone is a sinner.  Who'd like to hear that?  And all the more, it can only be salvation by faith.  And that sounds like blackmail (if you don't put things properly).  Hor?  Human psychology.<br><br>As for Luther, I was referring to those people who have bought the salvation certificates, during his time.  And well... apart from them, there are also those who have never heard about the Bible - tribal natives, etc.<br><br>Ok, thank you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mahatma Gandhi is the father of India.  He is famous for his non-violence movement.<br><br>In part, this non-violence idea took root in his mind while he was studying law in England.  He had attended a Christian gathering then.  That was when he learned about the Sermon on the Mount.<br><br>He was never a Christian.
