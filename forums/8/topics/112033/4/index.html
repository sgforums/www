It is certainly intruging though. But size wise, if placed at the center of the Solar System, it is estimated to extend to the orbit of earth. This is similiar to the size of Denab, one of the brightest stars in absolute magnitude, known to man. The size of Beteleuse, if put at the center of our solar system, would extend to 45% to 70% of Jupiter's orbit! That is larger than the Pistol Star.<br><br>BETELGEUSE (Alpha Orionis). The great star Betelgeuse is one of the two that dominate mighty Orion of winter, the other Rigel, the pair respectively called Alpha and Beta Orionis. The name Betelgeuse is a corruption of the Arabic "yad al jauza," which means the "hand of al-jauza," al-jauza the ancient Arabs' "Central One," a mysterious woman. For us, it marks the upper left hand corner of the figure of the Greek's ancient hunter (and since he is facing you, his right shoulder). One of the sky's two first magnitude supergiants (the other Antares of summer), Betelgeuse is one of the larger stars that can be seen, indeed one of the larger stars to be found anywhere. At its most likely distance of 425 light years, its measured angular diameter yields a radius 630 times that of the Sun, 2.9 astronomical units. If placed at the Sun, the star would go 55% of the way to the orbit of the planet Jupiter. The star is so large that it is the first ever actually directly imaged as a disk from Earth (by the Hubble Space Telescope). From its size and temperature, allowing for its infrared radiation, Betelgeuse shines an amazing 60,000 times brighter than our Sun. The distance, however, is so great to be subject to some uncertainty, the possible radius ranging from 45% to 70% of Jupiter's orbit, the luminosity from 40,000 solar to 100,000 solar.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>as for the brightest star, taking apparent<br>magnitude, it would have to be Sirius.<br><br>To clear up a few terms in this post, the last one, i shall give a glossary of terms<br><br>Apparent Magnitude: Apparent magnitude is the brightness of a star as seen from Earth.(as compared to Absoulte magnitude)<br><br>Absolute Magnitude: Absolute magnitude, however, is the brightness of a star supposing that it was located exactly 10 parsecs (about 32.6 light years) away from Earth.<br><br>First Magnitude Stars: The brightness of a star is usually expressed in terms of magnitudes. This scale is based on that devised by the second-century BC Greek astronomer Hipparchus who labelled the brightest stars as "first magnitude," the next brightest as "second magnitude," and so on with the faintest stars visible labelled as "sixth magnitude." This scale was placed on a mathematical basis in the nineteenth century when it was shown that a difference of five magnitudes corresponded with a factor of about 100 in brightness. Therefore, the magnitude scale was defined so that a difference of 100 in brightness exactly corresponded to a difference in five magnitudes.<br>A few stars are actually brighter than first magnitude so the scale was extended to zero and then to negative numbers. The smaller the magnitude is, the brighter the star. Thus, a star of magnitude -1 is brighter than one of magnitude +1 which in turn is brighter than one of magnitude +6. The faintest stars that can seen with the naked eye on a dark night are sixth magnitude, but the very best telescopes can see stars to magnitude +24.<br><br>IF we were talking about absolute magnitude, then perhaps Rigel, in the same constellation(Orion) as Betelgeuse, would be it.<br><br>RIGEL (Beta Orionis). Like its rival in Orion, Betelgeuse, Rigel (Beta Orionis) is a supergiant. Its name comes from the same root as Betelgeuse's, originally "rijl Al-jauza," meaning the "foot" of al-jauza, the Arabs "Central One." For us, the star represents the left foot of Orion, the mythical hunter. It is usually pictured as perched upon a fainter star, Cursa (Beta Eridani), which represents the hunter's foot stool. Though Rigel is Orion's Beta star, it appears to us somewhat brighter than the Alpha star, Betelgeuse, perhaps suggesting that Betelgeuse was somewhat brighter in times past. Rigel ranks 7th in apparent magnitude, just behind Auriga's Capella. At a distance of 775 light years, Rigel actually shines with the light of 40,000 Suns. It is a "blue supergiant," a fairly hot star with a surface temperature (11,000 Kelvin) about double that of our Sun. Its warmer temperature gives it a bluish-white light that contrasts beautifully with Betelgeuse(Red). If the hot star's invisible ultraviolet radiation is considered, the luminosity climbs to 66,000 solar, the radiation pouring from a star 70 times the solar size. Rigel is accompanied by a fairly bright, seventh magnitude companion nine seconds of arc away. Normally such a star is easily found in a small telescope, but Rigel's brilliance nearly overwhelms it. The companion, at least 50 times farther from Rigel than Pluto is from the Sun, is itself double, the components much fainter and much less massive class B main sequence stars that are fusing hydrogen into helium. Rigel is a part of a large association whose stars are related by birth. The group includes the stars of Orion's Belt, the Orion Nebula of Orion's sword and its illuminating stars, and many of the other hot blue-white stars in the constellation.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok Rigel is among one of the brightest Stars in absolute magnitude, but I have found one listed as having an absolute magnitude over 30% higher than Rigel. That star is called Deneb. Ufortunately due to the great distances involved and thus, margin of error involved, most, if not all, astronomers measure brightness in terms of apparent magnitude rather than absolute magnitude. In terms of apparent magnitude, Deneb lies 19th.<br><br>DENEB (Alpha Cygni). One of the truly great stars of our Galaxy, Deneb serves a three-fold role among the constellations. Its very name tells the first. "Deneb" is from an Arabic word meaning "tail," as this first magnitude (1.25) star, the 19th brightest as it appears in our sky, represents the tail of Cygnus the Swan, a classical figure seen flying perpetually to the south along the route of the Milky Way. As the constellation's luminary, the star is also Alpha Cygni. The reversal of Cygnus makes the asterism of the Northern Cross, with Deneb now at the top, the cross seen rising on its side in early northern summer, standing upright in the west in early northern winter evenings. Deneb also makes the western apex of the famed Summer Triangle, which also incorporates Vega and Altair. All three of these white class A stars (Deneb an A2 supergiant) have similar surface temperatures, Vega, at 9600 Kelvin, the warmest, Deneb radiating at 8400 Kelvin. Though Vega and Altair are really quite luminous, they are first magnitude primarily because they are close to us, averaging only 25 light years away. Deneb, on the other hand, may be as far as 2600 light years. Based on that distance, its awesome luminosity of 160,000 Suns makes it about the intrinsically brightest star of its kind (that is, in its temperature or spectral class) in the entire Galaxy. If placed at the distance of Vega, Deneb would shine as bright as a well- developed crescent Moon. Deneb is a true supergiant, its diameter, calculated from its temperature and luminosity, is 200 times that of the Sun. Direct measurement of its tiny angular diameter (a mere 0.002 seconds of arc) gives a very similar value of 180 solar. If it were placed at the center of our Solar System, Deneb would extend to the orbit of the Earth. While far from the largest star in the Galaxy, Deneb is one of the biggest of its kind. It is evolving and has stopped fusing hydrogen in its core. Just what it is doing, however, we do not know. Having begun its life as a star of some 25 solar masses, its fate is almost certainly to explode sometime within the next couple of million years. The star is constant in its light, but its spectrum, its light as seen when stretched into a rainbow, is slightly variable. Blowing from its surface is a wind that causes the star to lose mass at a rate of 0.8 millionths of a solar mass per year, a hundred thousand times the flow rate from the Sun. Deneb is among the most magnificent stars you can see with the unaided eye. (6/19/98, 8/2/02)<br><br></div>
