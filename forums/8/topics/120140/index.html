            <div class='col-md body'>Meditation usually refers to a state of extreme relaxation and concentration, in which the body is generally at rest and the mind quieted of surface thoughts. Several major religions include ritual meditation; however, meditation itself need not be a religious or spiritual activity. Most of the more popular systems of meditation are of Eastern origin.<br><br>Another form of meditation is more closely akin to prayer and worship, wherein the practitioner turns spiritual thoughts over in the mind and engages the brain in higher thinking processes. The goal in this case is the receipt of spiritual insights and new understanding.<br><br>From the point of view of psychology, meditation can induce Â— or is itself Â— an altered state of consciousness.<br><br>Meditation generally involves discounting wandering thoughts and fantasies, and calming and focusing the mind. Meditation does not necessarily require effort and can be experienced as "just happening". Physical postures include sitting cross-legged, standing, lying down, and walking (sometimes along designated floor patterns). Quietness is often desirable, and some people use repetitive activities such as deep breathing, humming or chanting to help induce a meditative state.<br><br>Meditation can be done with the eyes closed (as long as one does not fall asleep), or with the eyes open: focusing the eyes on a certain point of an object or image, and keeping the eyes constantly looking at that point.</div>

Or something that's continue to make a constant sound. Music was not recommended because you will be bought away by it.<br><br>Body must feels comfortable at ease without inducing sleep/dreaming. All the mentions positions for body is basically not to let the meditator to be over relax &amp; induce into sleep state of mind. These positions are tried &amp; tested over thousand of years. It's wise to follow.<br><br>Thoughts will come continuously. Key is to let it pass without clinging onto it.<br><br>Meditative state of mind is very close to state of sleep/dreaming. The only differences is there is a state of concious. You will be still alert in the mind "Only". When you start to feel too relax &amp; comfortable, mostly you are falling asleep. If things comes to your mind &amp; not very clear. You are dreaming or day dreaming. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Sometimes just pay attention or look after your own mind &amp; don't let it wander also works to concentrate.<br><br>Our mind are very funny, my own experiance. It tries to "Jump Start" itself when I cut off all external informations "feeding" to it. Example cut-off sense of sight, earing, touch,....  The "Jump Start" are feelings of moskito bites, feels falling, sense of coldness on the body, sense of fire burning my body, Weightlessness .....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Different people will feel differently. Don't take it as you will have such feelings of "Jump Starting".<br><br>Not "flick your tongue against your upper mouth".... more like touch the mouth's roof with the tip of the tongue.<br><br>Also before meditations prepare yourself. Don't engage into high active stuff. Like jogging, swimming, ... Clear you bladder &amp; bowel. Let your meal digest first before meditating. Recommended 2hrs after meal. Wear comfortable &amp; loose clothes. Clean yourself. Don't wear watch, necklace, wrist band... this is to ease your body. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Happy Meditating!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>

Surfer has earlier taught you what you should do in the meditation state. "Zuo4 chan2 and Jing4 Zuo4" are two different things don't mixed them up. Becos, nowadays, ppl seldom have the power to "chang1 chan2" anymore.<br><br>It just helps to ease your daily life and stress so you can attain more peace and "see" things better.<br><br>when you stop meditating, roll your body and head, stretch you legs, then you stand up.</div>

Basic stage is for you to clear your mind &amp; enter into a stable state of mind. Not like now, needing too many informations from external. Mind need not have those disturbing informations. Only when you are stable in your meditations. Then proceed to next step. Still better ask around or be guided. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>2) Yes legs gets numb &amp; painful when starting. After some practice these will reduce but still will be there. Do some stretching excise to reduce it further. Food &amp; your lifestyle also plays a part. When during meditations, those numb feelings come, I "Cut-Off" these message from passing to my brains/mind.<br><br>The more you do it the easier it gets. I still get numb legs everytime. It recover fast &amp; less pain.<br><br>The reasons you feel it's very pain because you are still accepting external informations feeding into your brains/mind &amp; to complain on the slightest miscomfort. It's normal don't worry. We are born to do this ever since. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> Use this: treat those feelings same way the clothes let you feel. It's always there. Only you start to accept &amp; notice then you "Actually" feels it. But this is not constantly this way. Much more of the time is you don't feel also you don't ignore it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Also same as you continue to breath thru out 24hrs, but you don't really notice it everytime. It's there &amp; you know it's there working for you. It's not ignored nor clinging onto it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Cutepixie,<br><br>If you believe, Once you attain the stable state of meditation, u will enter a realm of " Chu1 Chan2 Xiang3". {It takes approx 5-6 years of practice}<br><br>That's the most basic stage of "Zuo4 Chan2". However, which is during this stage most illusions will come in. Do not be distray as these illusions all seem so real but they are merelt decpetions. But to attend 2nd stage of you will need to break your "self". { This it takes another 15 yrs mininum to attend }<br><br>Many ppls suffer during the 1st stage of "Chan2 Zuo2" . Becos when they see "things" in their training, they got conceited and cling on and finally all effort of practice when into drain.<br><br>When you reach the 2nd Stage, u will be able to Perceive 3 things "Da1 Xin1 Tong1" Knowing what other's people is thinking, " Tian1 Yan4 Tong1" Seeing what most common ppl cannot see and "Tian1 Er2 Tong1" Hearin what most common ppl cannot hear.<br><br>Another 2 gifts you will get is only when u break 2nd stage and go onto the 3rd stage.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Do not input your own idea/thinking/rules to break thru "Self"<br><br>Too often we "See" things base on "Ourself" outwards. Anything bearing your input of mind is un-true. Like a curve mirror, out of perspective of "Truth".<br><br>It's pretty difficult to attain since not even felt once before. A good way is checking back, like "Have I input my own thinking with or without my own knowing?" "Have I sided with or without knowing?"... "Have I been absorbed into it?"  A good sense is, we can't induce dreaming but we dream. We are being absorb into dreams at "that" time. Why? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  See? Ourself did not go dreaming but we dream. Many times it's our own mind is playing on us. Minds did not stop when we go rest/sleep so we dreams. Have your mind stop in your meditations? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>The time frame stated above is only a guide. Most people takes much more that that ... may be 2~5 times more without guide or even never gets it.<br><br>A high tendencies is mind get absorbed into issues of "Seeing" things. Really it's much MORE exciting then watching TV (into the future/history of yourself &amp; other people)!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  And it's equal effort as watching TV .... Nothing is attain &amp; no effort is done.<br><br>Move away from "Seeing" it.<br></div>
