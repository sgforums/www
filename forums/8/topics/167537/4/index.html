Yes, I have already back all important documents up. Going to clean up my HD as last resort.

All the best then. Looking forward to hearing good news from you. Should the problem persists after your re-installation of OS, I would think that its time you call in the professional.

If it does.. it can mean two things. the file is corrupted or the hardware is spoilt. Conduct a defragment of your main harddisk. Is there any bad sectors? If no, I am sorry to say that your hardware is giving you trouble. My suspicion lies with the motherboard. Get a professional to look at it. Save time and money. You may want to try a re-installation of OS first though.</div>

Here goes..<br><br>After not shutting down my PC for a few days, and shutting it down again, it went on fine, so I had not reformatted my HD and reinstall everything.<br><br>However, just a few moments ago, when I boot up my PC, my monitor simply refuses to show any images while I could heard the Windows start up from my speakers. On my monitor, it reads "PC video resolution setting is out of range. Change Setting to 1024 x 768 @ 60Hz."<br><br>Well, I did a cold boot, and this time, it works again with Windows start up successfully, only with a message showing "Unable to start driver for hpo****.exe" (I cannot remember the file name". Went to check my system video resolution). It was 1024 x 768 after all, and I have also checked that the scree refresh rate was at 60Hz.<br><br>Interesting eh? Any advice from anyone? Perhaps some info on my PC system may help? My PC system is an Intel Pentium 4 2.53GHz, HP Pavilion t142d, ATI Radeon 9000 with 64MB DDR video memory. 512 MB DDR SDRAM. My monitor is hp pavilion f1503, a 15" LCD Panel.<br><br>By the way, GSL, I have done that - everything is normal; there was no device that was marked with "!" and nothing yellow or red. Thanks.</div></blockquote>Looks like your computer decides for once to work for you, and then fail you again.<br><br>After so many replies, I am suspecting that hardware could br the cause of your problem.<br><br>Anyway, before you get a new motherboard, reinstall and see if the problem happens again. If it happens again, I suggest you get it replaced, since your computer is still under warranty.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>as above if still under warranty.<br><br>but i would like to know if u ever did changed your graphics card? like maybe the HP PC comes with a nVidia card and u swapped it with an ATI without a complete removal of the drivers from the initial card?<br><br>i used to have this problem of cold and hot boot up thing with a Pentium 3 but after changing to a new unused graphics card...the problem's fixed. usually when suspected graphics card prob during boot up there will be a series of beep sounds.<br><br>as for hdd i guess not really a faliing one...u can check with some programs if u want but when the hdd fails...it just fails. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agreed, hard-disk fails when it cannot be detected by BIOS....<br><br>Probably bad connection, or Northbridge chip gone. (maybe bad sectors also)<br><br>For the GFX part, it is bad graphics drivers. Go to Safe Mode, remove your GFX drivers and let Windows use its own. Report back to SGF Camp with results.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i have a 14" LCD (very old model, porbably one of the first LCDs manufactured and pushed out) and nd newer 17" LCD. Sometimes i do trouble shooting and connect one PC to the 17" set to 1280x1024. when i connect the same set up bcak to the 14" LCD, the initial resolution is too high and the 14" LCD cannot read it at the right frequency...so the computer still runs but the 14" LCD just display "out of range" and goes to standby mode.<br><br>so, i will connect the display back to the 17" LCD set it to the native 1024x768 for a 14" set up, save changes (although now it looks weird on a 17") and shut down. reconnect to the 14" aggain and power on...done no more issue.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
