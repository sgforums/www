Brilliant! Brilliant! Cannot believe that such a movie could be made in Hindi cinema.Complete Kudos to the screenplay,director,actors and the whole team for producing such a brilliant movie.<br><br>It would be a mistake according to me not to support such movies and label them as preachy or patriotic movies for mocking reasons. Reality is it is a sensible movie which talks to all walks of life.<br><br>The balance between ideologies,reality and humor has been taken care off in the most spectacular manner; never making the audience feel small,blamed or negative.<br><br>The characters are very real and they do make a lot of sense. The issues that have been touched are topics which we choose not to talk about or act on but at the same time it is no lecture and the light heartedness of the college environment makes you feel nostalgic and calm.<br><br>The movie is all about hope. Once again awesome job to the rang DE bas anti team! Peace<br></div>

It sure made my day !!!!!!!!........and the days to come !!!<br><br>Rakesh Omprakash Mehra's movie 'Rang De Basanti' is a must-watch for reasons that the length of this review may not suffice to express. More than just a technically brilliant flick, 'Rang De Basanti' has a story that entertains you, makes you think and stirs you deep inside in the end.<br><br>The most remarkable part of the movie is the parallel that Mehra draws between the freedom fighters and DJ and his group of friends. The movie keeps transposing the same actors into characters from the past. And then, as the story draws to its conclusion, even these differences in the characters disappear. The modern, city-bread 'young guns' of the twenty first century become one in spirit with the revolutionaries who sacrificed themselves for the country's freedom.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1 out of 1 people found the following comment useful :-<br>A piece of cinematic brilliance!, 30 January 2006<br><br>Author: A P from Switzerland<br><br>Rang de Basanti- A Generation awakens, marks Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's return to direction after a hiatus of nearly five years. As with his earlier venture Aks, Rang de Basanti stands out for its technical brilliance. Yet, this time Mehra also proves that he is an excellent story-teller and brings out magnificent performances from all his actors.<br><br>The title Rang de Basanti is inspired from the legendary song of the same name that the Indian Freedom Fighter Bhagat Singh sang, while he and his comrades were being taken to the gallows, way back in 1931. That is essentially what the movie is about, the awakening of the "MTv" generation to the problems faced by modern India, just like a generation of young Indians awakened in the 1920s to take proactive measures against a tyrannical imperial rule.<br><br>When a young British filmmaker comes to New Delhi to make a documentary about the lives of the Indian Revolutinaries, she is shocked at the apathetic and indifferent attitude of the young India. This generation is consumed by materialism, is cynical to the core, and the sacrifices of their forefathers for the country's freedom seem to matter little to them. Yet deep inside, lies a sense of frustration and helplessness against a system so wrong that little hope exists of correcting it. As she ropes in a bunch of college going youngsters to star in her documentary she realizes how hard her job is going to be. Slowly however, she notices a change in the attitudes of these young students. And one event changes everything.......<br><br>Rang de Basanti is filled with poignant moments that truly force the viewer to think. Rang de Basanti is filled with excellent performances, especially that of Aamir Khan. The man is in excellent form and the viewer is awed watching his realistic and convincing performance as the effervescent DJ. The support cast does exceedingly well with stellar performances from Kunal Kapoor, Siddharth and Sharman Joshi. This is a movies that one doesn't come across everyday, and kudos to the makers for attempting a different and refreshing film. Rakeysh Mehra, take a bow, you have made a gem! This movie works all right!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>More reviews i think this will soon reach rating 10/10 @ IMDB!. It is also taking the US movie audience by storm.....<br><br>More Than A Wake-up Call, A Thought Provoking Movie For Our Times, 31 January 2006<br><br>Author: skfazli from United States<br><br>If I wait any more to say all the things I want to say about this great soul-stirring movie I will never be able to say it.It is the best use of the film medium that I have seen in a long long time.Here in the west we have virtually abandoned good cinema.Where are our Capras,our Wilders, our Hitchcocks, our David Leans? We make trivia now that neither entertain nor enlighten.To put it very bluntly, we make utter trash.Good work in the world is being done elsewhere, especially in India where a Bhansali stretches the limits of cinematic expression, where a new Wilder emerges in the shape of Anees Bazmee, where Shaad Ali springs a surprise with a Bunty Aur Bubbly,where out of nowhere comes a Guru Dutt in the garb of Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra and takes us to a new level of awareness and self-discovery through cinema in a stunning masterpiece called Rang De Basanti.<br><br>I challenge anyone to name a film made anywhere in the last fifteen years or so to hold a candle to this one.It is simply awesome.As an entertainer it is superb, as purposeful film it goes even further.As a fearless, bold crusader for just causes it is beyond compare.The whole team deserves to be congratulated.<br><br>Apart from the tremendous contribution made by the writers and the director of the movie, the people who need to be singled out and applauded for the high quality of their work are Aamir Khan(his best role yet),Soha Ali Khan(who finally claims our attention with this role and is destined to be as distinguished as her mother Sharmila Tagore). Waheeda Rehman makes you feel that Guru Dutt is back directing her from heaven.Kirron Kher who is improving with every picture.And all the boys from Kunal Kapoor to Atul Kulkarni.All have turned in amazing performances.After Devdas and Munna Bhai MBBS, Binod Pradhan has once again shown that as an ace cameraman he is second to none.And what can you say about A.R. Rahman?This time he even sings like a pro.He is paired here for the first time with Prasoon Joshi who makes you think of Majrooh Sultanpuri.But before I forget, I must mention Alice Patten. She is a joy to behold.And she makes a great pair with Aamir.<br><br>The film does not have a single dull moment in it.It can be repeated again and again with increasing returns to the viewer.It is a crossover film and needs to be seen by every one in the world.Its publicity and promotion should be geared to that.It should be sent to every international film festival in the world and should be India's entry to the Oscars this year.</div>

It is beautifully directed, flows well, raises issues and suggests courses of action to give direction to youth........... all without heavy philosophizing.<br><br>It brings to our attention the corruption of some of the politicians and how the consequences of their greed destroy lives but they refuse to accept responsibility. It raises issues of the fears of the youth to step out of the shelter of 'safe' college environment and their comfort zone to actually face life and take on the responsibilities of earning a living and marriage and family........ going from being 'somebody' whom everyone knows and respects to being a 'nobody' in the real world.<br><br>All this is done in a humorous, poignant and subtle manner. Leaves you with hope, desire for action and a sense of direction. History repeating itself with a different cast of characters. Three hours well spent!</div>

The way the story has been told is just unbelievable. I could not find any fault in the movie. Amir Khan is great!!! But all the actors were superb. I give a full credit to Director and I could not thank you enough for bringing this kind of movie. The film does not need an Oscar Lable. The movie is above the level of any kind of cinema.<br><br>I have just come out of theatre and decided to write my first comment on IMDb. Will go out next weekend to watch it again!! Missing this movie will be real loss on your part. Don't miss it..Don't listen the story line up from friends..Experience yourself!!</div>

It is extremely well made, has an intelligent script that reflects the transition of its characters and comes full circle with an emotionally charged finale. One of the selling points of this film is its ensemble acting effort. It is by no means an Aamir Khan film. Every actor stands out with finely etched out performances and characters. I will not go into the plot, because if you don't have much of an idea about it, the more powerful the impact of the film is. Suffice it to say it is an entertainer with a strong message and top notch production qualities. Enjoy!</div>

After a detailed meeting with the IAF in Delhi, the producer UTV and lead star Aamir Khan have rumouredly returned to Mumbai victorious, as no cuts were ordered.<br><br>The film will now go through the usual evaluation procedure by the Indian censor board.

            <div class='col-md body'># re: Rang De Basanti: Rocks!<br>Folks,<br><br>This movie is perhaps one of the finest movies ever made in Indian Cinema. Trust, the movie has the potential to change the perception we have about today's India. I'll be honest, I used to one of the very vocal critique's of India and it's system, but the movie has taught me that it's sooo superficial and hypocritical to pass on critique's without actually doing anything about it! No more India bashing now. RDB simply rocks....2 thumbs up! Pls ask your family, friends &amp; well-wishers to go out and see the movie in theatres. Such movies need everyone's support! The movie is doing pretty well here in Toronto &amp; elsewhere in N Americas. Hope it turns out to be a thundering success commercially everywhere as well!! Aamir you rock man....<br><br>PLS GO AND WATCH THE MOVIE AT LEAST ONCE.....IT MIGHT CHANGE YOU AS WELL!<br><br>2/1/2006 3:25 AM | Mahan Sodhi<br># re: Rang De Basanti: Rocks!<br>Great Movie.<br>Great way of story telling, potraying the impulse of the great patriots and reflection of the same in the modern youth is phenomenal.<br>Good message for youth.<br>A new generation of movie errupts from RDB.<br>Full credit goes to the entire unit.<br><br>1/31/2006 1:06 PM | Shouvik Mitra<br># re: Rang De Basanti: Rocks!<br>xxx is trying to get funny a bit too much.Maybe that's the way mice behave when they are shown the mirror.Not his fault.Take heart.<br>1/31/2006 11:32 AM | mayor<br># re: Rang De Basanti: Rocks!<br>No, this was not a movie, not a documentary, not a history lesson, and not even reality. This was a dream, a dream that today's youth should see to change India, do away with this "Parliamentary Imperialism", make a pledge to clean Bharat...Mera Bharat that has been contaminated with evils of communalism, regionalism, corruption, and the so called legislative/executive/judicial organisms. Learn from our glorious history, sacrifices that patriots of the past made.<br>In the beginning, I said that RDB was not even a reality because in REAL India you lose, you don't win like the FIVE did in RDB. If this were reality, we won't have sat quiet when Prof. M. C. Puri was shot dead by so called terrorists last month. In fact, were they really terrorists or a result of dirty politics of contemporary India? We don't need to tolerate these atrocities. Why don't we have our governments and leaders to change things. We don't want their resignations, we want them to suffer the same way, we want them to feel the pain, we want them to value our so called "DEMOCRATIC" lives. Can we trust them? I WISH I COULD SAY YES!!! And that's what RDB teaches, and makes us DO THE REVOLUTION...<br><br>Mera Bharat Mahaan if and only if we could cleanse our motherland...Hats off RDB for making us feel our guilt...</div>
