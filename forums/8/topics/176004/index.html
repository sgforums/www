An engrossing entertainer from a genre that’s still young in Indian cinema. A film that fiercely eyeballs you, grabs you by the solar and rattles the nonchalance out of you. A glorious tapestry with layers upon layers of the moments and decisions that make the lives of beautifully defined characters. Engrossing entertainment meets taut social comment with perfect timing in Rang De Basanti. Wake up India, Rang De Basanti is here!<br><br>The film revolves around a group of five friends played by Aamir Khan, Soha Ali, Kunal Kapoor, Siddharth and Sharman Joshi, who go through an entire roller coaster ride of changes. The changes aren’t the ones youngsters usually encounter - these are changes that are very concrete and change their lives completely. The central character or sutradhar of the film is Sue McKinley (English actor Alice in a wonderful portrayal) who is a young documentary filmmaker who comes to India armed with her grandfather’s diary and a mission to make a documentary film based on the freedom fighters of India. This diary has the personal experiences her grandfather encountered while dealing with Indian revolutionaries like Bhagat Singh. It also tells her about the lessons he learnt about life and living.<br><br>Sue comes to India after quitting her job in London. Her friend Sonia (Soha Ali Khan) welcomes her and makes all the arrangements for her to shoot the documentary. After scores of fruitless auditions, she is desperate to find the actors for her documentary on the freedom fighters. And suddenly, she realizes that she need never have looked any father than her friend Sonia’s gang of Aslam (Kunal Kapoor), Karan (Telugu movies’ superstar Siddharth), Diljeet or DJ (Aamir Khan) and Sukhi (Sharman Joshi). Aslam is a mast maula poet and is very secular in his outlook, and hence very different from his parents and family. Karan is the not-so-spoilt son of a rich businessman (Anupam Kher) who deals in MIG aircraft parts.<br><br>DJ is an amazingly lively character full of energy and enthusiasm. He is the only son of dhaba owner Mitro (Kirron Kher). Beneath his enthusiasm lies a fear of not making it big in the world outside his college campus. Sukhi is another heart-on-sleeves character. He is also DJ’s soul mate. Laxman Pandey (brilliantly played by Atul Kulkarni) is a political party worker who is a firm believer of his party’s principles which, however, he later realizes are all fake. He is the kind who considers all Muslims as traitors and Pakistanis as people who have only hatred for India.<br><br>In the first half, the film develops these characters and precisely tells the audience how close they unconsciously are to their characters in the documentary. The first half is rocking and bombards the audience with comedy, a pinch of romance and good foot tapping numbers (AR Rahman) with lyrics (Prasoon Joshi) that acquire even more beauty when seen in the film.<br><br>In the second half, suddenly, the carefree lives and attitudes of DJ’s gang changes due to a huge twist. Ajay (Madhavan) who is an Air force pilot, a good son, a patriotic Indian and Sonia’s fiancee, and also the ideal of DJ and his gang, is killed in a plane crash. This incident rattles the happy-go-lucky friends who so far had been resigned to Fate and the fact that corruption is far too deep-rooted in India to be eradicated. But the loss of Ajay jolts them and they decide to take things in hand, realizing that if they are to make a difference and make the youth of India wake up to reality, they will have to take up the challenge.<br><br>The transition, the speed at which the film moves, and all the sequences fall in place very well without boring the audience for a single minute. You literally watch the film from the edge of your seat, waiting to see what happens next. However, it does have a utopian ending, though with a welcome positive feel to it.<br><br>The film has an intricate screenplay that unfolds layer by layer, and grows upon you with moments that slowly and imperceptibly weave themselves into a fine, taut tapestry. And the tight editing, excellent cinematography, dialogues and performances achieve a high degree of class. All parts of a sum total that equals excellent direction. The film has a north Indian feel to it which comes through effectively in the form of dialogues and scenes shot in and around the capital.<br><br>The film comes off really well and is the kind you take home after you’ve walked out of the cinema hall. Binod Pradhan’s cinematography is first rate. And not one of the songs is out of place. Their presence is quite with the film and they give the feel of the youth. The director has been just to all the characters. Nobody steals the frame from the others. Here, the screenplay is king - each character receives its due weightage and prominence, and very sensibly so. Aamir Khan is at his brilliant best, as always, and Kunal Kapoor’s restrained intensity is a revelation. Soha should be delighted she finally has a role to sing about, and Telugu movies’ hotshot star Siddharth, who had 2004 biggest Telugu hit to his name, was absolutely first rate, as was the simmering performance from Atul Kulkarni. A breath of fresh air amongst female performances in a month of Sundays has been that of Alice, who plays Sue. Kirron Kher as Mitro and Madhavan as the sort of son every mother dreams of, were memorable. As, indeed, is the music. Above average on the album, but so very apt and beautifully evocative in the film!<br><br>But the real hero of Rang De Basanti is its director - Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra. Kudos!<br><br>A pure delight, Rang De Basanti is a cult film - the sort that comes along in a long time, and will raise the bar for everyone.<br><br>Rating: ****<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not new. Even spice girl appear before<br><br>Emma Bunton (Pyaar Mein Twist)<br><br>After Spice girl Emma Bunton failed internationally, she came to India. Unfortunately for her, the film in which she made a special appearance was also a failure.<br><br>There were high hopes as everyone assumed Rishi Kapoor and Dimple Kapadia would resurrect the magic of Bobby at the box office. Bunton shot for three nights, wearing traditional Indian costumes, with jewellery and mehendi on her hands.<br><br>"For a pop star of her international stature, she was very down-to-earth. She had no airs, and no hang-ups while working with us. She gelled with everyone. She was professional to the core and very obedient. The whole Indian film experience was new to her -- the number of people on the sets, everything," said Hriday Shetty, the director of the film. "She told me she wants to come back to India and stay longer next time."<br><br>Then, the film disappeared from the box office. As did Emma from Bollywood</div>

Oops;.that's suppose to be Rang De Basanti;.. Well that's exactly the director tries to convey. Its about today, us and our present, yet the similarities we have from the Pre-independence era. The Gen-x who knows Mac-D but still prefers the Dhaba Paranthas with sweet Lassi. However they restrict their national values only to food and nothing more. Its not a run of the mill stuff with 6 six romantic songs, couple of foreign locales and then finally some emotional drama".. No no no";.. Rang De"is a Cult movie. It is more of an introspection, a food our thought process. It makes us think, as to how should we actually celebrate our freedom. I was really moved by some of the ending lines by the narrator, "I thought there are 2 types of people in the world, one who die crying and other who move away in silence but today I learned there is third genre, people who go laughing". That says it all";<br><br>Rang De.....; is definitely a very brave and innovative attempt by the director and for that matter he has selected a near perfect cast. However veterans like Om Puri and Anupam Kher looked disposed. All the characters grow gradually in the film and make you think their way. Everyone is given enough space to justify their talent. Rakesh Omprakash Mehra is a director of the new emerging Indian cinema, he always tries to bring in something very different. I was really impressed by his last attempt in 2001 for Aks (Amitabh Bachchan and Manoj Bajpai ), and he definitely has succeeded in making another fabulous master piece. The highlight of the movie is the great use of cinematography techniques. Its probably for the first time in Indian cinema that juxtaposing has been used with such a great effect. The way each character gradually immerses into scenes from the past leaves you fantasizing about the hard work that has gone in the background to create this, both technically and on the part of the actor.<br><br>The movie starts on a very high spirit reflecting today's youth mindset who believe that patriotism is something that looks good in history chapters and today's world is far ahead of all that, they would prefer to go boozing and dancing rather than thinking on any of those lines. The way the campus scenes are shown really makes everyone go down the memory lanes of beautiful college days. This is followed by some intriguing drama and events which turns the life of a group of buddies upside-down altogether.<br><br>The film grows on you gradually. The director has made sure that there is a clear message in everything he presents, even the group of boys represents different sects of society and religion. Hence creating an appeal for everyone watching it. Music is another high point of the show, its foot tapping and very much with the mood of the subject. The songs give you a sense of freedom from within, a freedom to think in one's own way. A.R. Rehman doesn't need any introductions and he is surely one of the most original music directors we have in the country.<br><br>The brilliance of Aamir Khan is something very difficult to narrate, he has proved it umpteen number of times that he is truly the most versatile actor in the industry. His comic timing in the first part is better than anything seen in recent past. He is extremely fluent even with difficult Punjabi tongue twisters and the acting prowess he has shown would be very difficult to match by anyone around. He appears so natural and his complete look with new hairstyle (which is now part of his every new movie) gives a very striking combination.<br><br>Well the most wanting part of the whole thing has been the script to certain extent, it appears very loose in the second half and at times gives a droning feel. Few new ideas presented by the author looked half-baked. However it has been the technical expertise of the director who managed to save the things with some outstanding camera work and editing.<br><br>Rang De'; is for sure a must watch movie, it doesn't have any preaching but still it will force you to think once. As they say it "There are two primary choices in life, to accept conditions as they exist or take upon the responsibility to change them". I believe most of us want to bring about the changes without doing anything, so its time to think again folks and take some responsibility, lets Paint It Yellow ';</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>More  review<br><br>Aamir Khan shows his true talents in a film that takes viewers on a journey that truly changes one's perspective of what really is freedom and democracy.<br><br>Rang De Basanti is one of the best Hindi movies I have ever seen. And one of the reasons that it is so good is that it sheds light on the true political state in current India while at the same time reflecting on the the revolutionaries and freedom fighters of pre-independent India and their fight to death for the sake of independence.<br><br>Aamir Khan stars as D.J., a fun loving, outgoing guy who loves to party. After Sue McKinly, an English woman whose job is to do a documentary on Chandrashekhar Azad, Rajguru and Bhagat Singh, comes to India and asks D.J. and his friends to act in her documentary, she changes their lives forever.<br><br>The film is somewhat based on a true incident that occurred in Punjab about 5 years ago. As the shitty Indian government imports cheap Russian parts for their MIG-21 jets, 78 pilots have lost their lives in the last 15 years. This has served as the momentum to make this film. And as the horrifying reality behind all the political lies that we face is surfaced, it has created an awe and desperation in the minds of the viewers for revenge. This is the greatest movie of the 21st century would be an understatement. Praise Aamir Khan yet again.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Several cinemas in India are said to be giving a standing ovation to the UTV-produced 'Rang De Basanti'. The long weekend has immensely helped the film (also Republic Day being a bank holiday) and while some trade analysts say the film has not lived up to expectations, a large section of the media and almost every audience member seems to be enormously impressed by the film. These are the general observations:<br><br>a) A.R. Rahman's music grows amazingly - 'Paathshaala', 'Roobaroo' and the title song are the clear winners<br>b) English actress Alice Patten is a revelation and speaks Hindi proficiently<br>c) Every actor has performed exceptionally - Siddharth Suryanarayan who replaced Arjun Rampal is the surprise package of the film<br>d) The photography and editing are first-rate, so is the dialogue track and execution of the comic and intense moments<br><br>While 'Family' was an unfortunate bomb, 'Zinda' tanked pretty badly at the box-office as well, contrary to what its makers have been saying. With the strong opening for 'Rang De Basanti', it has rained early in 2006 in the film industry!</div>
