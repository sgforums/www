            <div class='col-md body'>I remembered when I and my previous gf broke off, she cried and insist on a patch up for 2 months. 2 months!! I lived in nightmare for that 2 months!! And at last, I couldn't bear it any longer and I scolded her in the harshest tone I ever had. It hurt her pride badly.<br><br>And after a few nights, she tried to "commit suicide" (I dunno if she's acting or wad). Isn't that stupid?! I mean, to commit suicide is a VERY silly thing to do so. And many people even tried to call up that person and say, :"You must take care of yourself in future." And HANG UP!!!<br><br>What the fucK is that huh?!<br><br>Are they trying to win sympathy or wad? I remembered that nite, its was around 3am and I received such a call from her. I rushed there although I was damn irritated and annoyed by her.<br><br>I wasn't afraid of blood at all. And I often tease those guys who faint on the sight of blood. But on that very night, I saw how the blood oozed out from my ex-gf wrist. And how deep and disgusting the cut is. From then on, my hands feel weak when I saw blood.(Not those kind of wounds..I'm refering to streams of blood)<br><br>Useless hor? Haha.. Though the cut on my ex-gf wrist is very deep, but until now I still ponder about her intentions of doing that. IF she didn't call me up, perhaps I will be convinced.</div>

I lived in nightmare for that 2 months!! And at last, I couldn't bear it any longer and I scolded her in the harshest tone I ever had. It hurt her pride badly.<br><br>And after a few nights, she tried to "commit suicide" (I dunno if she's acting or wad). Isn't that stupid?! I mean, to commit suicide is a VERY silly thing to do so. And many people even tried to call up that person and say, :"You must take care of yourself in future." And HANG UP!!!<br><br>What the fucK is that huh?!<br><br>Are they trying to win sympathy or wad? I remembered that nite, its was around 3am and I received such a call from her. I rushed there although I was damn irritated and annoyed by her.<br><br>I wasn't afraid of blood at all. And I often tease those guys who faint on the sight of blood. But on that very night, I saw how the blood oozed out from my ex-gf wrist. And how deep and disgusting the cut is. From then on, my hands feel weak when I saw blood.(Not those kind of wounds..I'm refering to streams of blood)<br><br>Useless hor? Haha.. Though the cut on my ex-gf wrist is very deep, but until now I still ponder about her intentions of doing that. IF she didn't call me up, perhaps I will be convinced.</div></blockquote>haiyo y rake up the past.since it's an unhappy thing,forget it clean lor<br></div>
