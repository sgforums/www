Granted, neither the girl nor the guy should lay hands on each other, but surely one party must have pissed off the other to cause the other party to get pissed off enough to lay hands, right? It could be that the guy has a problem and a bad habit of hitting other people, but most guys don't just start fighting with other people for no reason.<br><br>I always get a little upset when I see guys getting vilified just because they lost control and hit someone. My own parents always used to get into fights often, and my mum always used to try to make it seem like my dad was in the wrong, just because he hit her. And as a sidenote, a slap has very very different implications and connotations from a punch, kick, etc. My mum would betray my dad's trust by selling the car without telling my dad, selling one of the properties by abusing the power-of-attorney thing my dad gave my mum, wreck my dad's precious antique collection, and a lot of other stuff and my dad would still be in the wrong just because he slapped her, which in my opinion, she deserved. In short, my dad did hit my mum, but my mum provoked my dad by emotionally and psychologically abusing him. In everyone's eyes, my dad still is at fault. The moment a guy hits a girl or has sex with her, the guy is at the girl's mercy. It doesn't seem to matter what she first did to provoke the guy hitting her, and even though it was consentual sex she can just cry rape and the guy will take the fall. After getting accused of physical abuse or sexual assault, the guy can't even cross-examine the girl on the premise that she's "too terrified and traumitised" to face the guy. Isn't the girl given too much of the benefit of the doubt in such cases? My dad didn't even stand a chance when he was given a warning by the judge after my mum hauled him to court.<br>Fair? I don't think so.<br><br>Whenever encountering cases about guys hitting girls, always look at the details, find out the real story and please...hear out the guy before jumping to the conclusion that he's in the wrong.

            <div class='col-md body'>"Chamenos : If the guy is pissed,he should possess enough self control to note lay his hands on a girl.Hitting a girl is wrong no matter what the reason.It doesn't help to start whacking someone whenever you are pissed,ehehe" - moose<br><br>Again, no offence, but if self-control was so easy, we won't have so many problems today, right? The Israel-Palestinian conflict wouldn't be getting so bad if it was so easy for the leaders of both countries to just possess enough self control to not bomb the crap out of each other.<br><br>Hitting a girl is wrong no matter what the reason? Just for curiosity sake, do you think hitting a guy is wrong as well, no matter what the reasons? The courts in Singapore certainly don't think so. Men get caned for every stupid thing and women will never get caned no matter what they do wrong. Protecting women like that just because they're female is really nothing more than misguided chivalry. To show chivalry is to think with your balls, not your head. Whether male or female, right is right, and wrong is wrong. Your gender can and should never will make a wrong more right, or a right more wrong. This form of blatant sexual discrimination is fucking disgusting but sadly, it will never change, or at least I'll probably never live to see it change.<br><br>Again, I really mean no offence to you but I'd like to see you being put in a position where a girl really pisses you off so much that you hit her, and then you'll see that it isn't really so easy to just hold back. Lets say this ex-girlfriend is so upset that you didn't buy her a $10,000 diamond ring for her 2 week aniversary, that she accused you of rape, murdered your mother and framed your brother for it, then blew up your new car and made it look like you did it yourself to claim the insurance. Lets say somehow the case goes through and you and your brother are both found beyond reasonable doubt to be guilty. After that, you get thrown in jail for 2 counts of aggravated assault with sexual intent (she accuses you of molesting her grandma too), arson, forgery, and your brother gets hanged for a crime he didn't commit. To add insult to your injury, she comes to the prison to see you weekly, to laugh at your bleeding asshole caused by your gay cellmate who ass-rapes you 4 times a day, and lets his friends ass-rape you for free ciggarettes. I know this is a very far-fetched example, but the point I'm trying to make is that everyone has a snapping-point. Self-control is a relative thing and the same standards don't hold true for everyone out there. There is no such thing as unconditional self-control, the same way there is no such thing as a perfect peace process, or an unhackable secure computer code. To assume otherwise would be being unrealistic and foolishly optimistic.<br><br>As for me, I have certain limits, and if seriously pushed far enough and off the edge, I'll fight back. And it definitely doesn't matter whether the person is male or female. Btw, if you study biology, you'll realize how similar men and women are, contrary to what society has you belief. I don't see how women can be so different as to render them more morally upright, socially immune to physical abuse (I still think caning is nothing more than state-sanctioned physical abuse), and exemptable from NS. In olden days, an aristocrat is someone who has a better life laid out before him/her as a birthright due to his/her lineage. Doesn't it seem like modern western society is creating an aristocracy out of women?<br><br>ok sorry I'm going out of topic here but I think you all got my point, right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>"thank u really thanks 4 the effort to comfort me thank u other than thank u dunno how to express my gratitude" - queenie<br><br>you're welcome  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>"i know wat u r trying to say... when i was younger, my parents fought.. and it was alwyas my father who got blue-black skins and tore clothes... kekekee" - bigdeal<br><br>Hey, its nice to know someone who can see my point of view and understand what I'm getting at  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
