            <div class='col-md body'><strong> Sunderland 0 - 1 West Ham United</strong><br><br>A single Frederic Kanoute goal was enough for West Ham to progress into the Quarter Finals of the FA Cup, as Sunderland were disappointing.<br>Sunderland got off to a bright start in the first few minutes, but a break from Frederic Kanoute in the 4th minute could have given West Ham a dream start. He broke, as the Sunderland players assumed it must be offside, KanouteÂ’s pace beat the trap and was through.<br>His touch let him down and pushed the ball too far away from him, he had done all the hard work and should have done better.<br>It was Kanoute again in the 9th minute when he had the ball, a better first touch, but the defenders closed him down, forced an early shot and the ball went just wide of the goal with the keeper beaten.<br>These chances brought West Ham to life and the forward players were now particularly eager to have the ball.<br>Kanoute beat the defence and reached the goal line almost with a ball crying out to be crossed square, but his pace had also beaten his teammates and there was no one up to support this golden opportunity.<br>Sunderland were feeling the pressure, but as always were still dangerous.<br>They broke and won a corner, only for Stanislav Varga to head straight in to the arms of Shaka Hislop.<br>In the 21st minute, Varga had to be replaced by George McCartney after he was fouled by Kanoute as he pushed clear towards the goal once more.<br>A handful of difficult offside decisions were given against Kanoute before half-time and the frustration for the young star was telling.<br>A 27th minute Phillips freekick looked promising but was hit straight against the wall.<br>John Oster made a great skipping run through in the 30th minute and shot, but the ball was weak. Hislop failed to pick it up though and Phillips charged in to shoot from a tight angle, but could only find the side netting. It was the best Sunderland move of the match.<br>Darren Williams was booked on the 32nd minute and gave The Hammers a great chance just outside the box. Frustration at the decision was obvious and Emerson Thome also found his name taken after a light tap across Sebastien SchemmelÂ’s face. The resulting Stuart Pearce freekick, though, disappointed and hit the wall.<br>Tempers were raised.<br>In the second half, West Ham started as their finished the first and Joe Cole found himself with the ball in the Sunderland box after a lovely little drag down only for Paulo Di Canio to take on the ball and hit the side netting. Cole should have shot himself.<br>Sunderland were unlucky not to get something in the 50th minute when Nigel Winterburn was seen to have his arms all over Niall Quinn in the box, but the referee Alan Wiley decided not to give a foul.<br>Sunderland increased the pressure with neat skill from Oster, but nothing could come from an excellent cross.<br>On 65 minutes Quinn followed a floated ball into the Hammers box, but his touch to bring it down deserted him and no goal.<br>Sunderland were enjoying their best spell of the game.<br>Another chance was made and wasted by West Ham in the 70th minute when a fantastic pass down the middle was picked up by Frank Lampard, but the ball was hit straight at the keeper.<br>West HamÂ’s defence, and Stuart Pearce particularly, stopped Sunderland taking the lead, but a break by The Hammers in the 75th minute finally broke the deadlock.<br>Kanoute was finally not offside and ran down the middle. Pressure was on from the defenders, Thomas Sorensen came out, when he perhaps should have stayed near his line, and Kanoute slipped it neatly into the open goal.<br>It was nearly two aswell straight after when Kanoute broke on the right of the box, but dragged it wide of the post.<br>Stuart Pearce again was magnificent in the 81st minute when Oster was blocked in the box.<br>All of Sunderland's attempts were in vain though as the clock ran down and West Ham were worthy winners and progress into the Quarter Finals.<br>The game was a case of Kanoute fighting with the offside rule up front and a superb performance at the back from Stuart Pearce.<br>The Hammers deserve their win and look forward to whatever the Cup now holds for them.<br><br>USairways..dun sad ok??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> FnU  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>------------------<br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums_display.php3?number=196" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/forums_display.php3?number=196</a><br>^<br>||<br>||<br><strong> CLICK HERE AND STAND A CHANCE TO WIN $1,000,000 ONLINE!!!</strong></div>
