            <div class='col-md body'>Did Zhao Ziyang die on January 8 or did he die on the morning of... ...<br><br>Did Zhao Ziyang die on January 8 or did he die on the morning of<br>January 17? That is a million yuan question!<br><br>On the same day in 1976, another Chinese leader, its Prime Minister<br>Zhou Enlai, passed away.<br><br>When Zhou died, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution had just<br>ended. Modern China had gone through its 10 most tormented years.<br><br>During previous months, Mao had refused to provide treatment for his<br>premier who had cancer; the Emperor wanted Zhou to die before him.<br><br>Even in Communist China, there is protocol!<br><br>In fact, the problem was that the premier was more popular than the<br>Great Helmsman with the masses. Zhou's death was observed by Dr Zhisui Li,<br>Mao's private physician who commented: 'What worried me most was the<br>power struggle to follow.'<br><br>In Beijing, memories of the Cultural Revolution purges were still fresh<br>in the populace's psyche. Though resentment was growing, nothing could<br>be done openly as yet.<br><br>At that time, the Chinese New Year was approaching. When Mao decided to<br>celebrate the event with firecrackers, the crowd outside Zhongnanhai<br>(the residential enclave where Politburo members live) thought the<br>Chairman rejoiced over his premier's death. Anger mounted, but the people of<br>Beijing had to wait a few more weeks to express their respect for the<br>deceased leader.<br><br>Dr Li wrote: 'Beginning in mid-March, knowing that the Qing Ming<br>festival for honoring the dead would be celebrated on April 4, the citizens<br>of Beijing began going to the Monument to the Revolutionary Heroes in<br>Tiananmen Square to place mourning wreaths for Zhou. The movement was<br>spontaneous, and the crowds grew larger by the day. The country had not<br>witnessed such an outpouring of popular sentiment since before the<br>Communists came to power in 1949.'<br><br>As April 4 approached, Dr Li visited Tiananmen clandestinely: 'The<br>Square was filled with tens of thousands of people singing, making<br>speeches, and reading poems. The mourning wreaths stretched from the Monument<br>to the Revolutionary Heroes in the centre of the square all the way to<br>Changan Avenue just in front of the Gate of Heavenly Peace, and<br>thousands of banners were flapping in the breeze. It was impressive and<br>moving.'<br><br>A similar event occurred 13 years later.<br><br>In 1989, though Hu Yaobang had been sacked as the secretary general of<br>the Chinese Communist Party in January 1987, he was still a member of<br>the Politburo and entitled to attend important meetings. On April 9,<br>after uttering some strong words on the Communist Party's failures, the<br>respected Hu Yaobang had a stroke. A week later he passed away.<br><br>Zhao Zhiang, then secretary general of the Chinese Communist Party,<br>made the customary brief assessment of Hu's life: 'Comrade Hu was a loyal,<br>tried and tested Communist fighter, a great proletarian revolutionary<br>and politician, an outstanding political worker for the army.'<br><br>It was agreed that Hu would have a national funeral service with the<br>norms of standing members of the Politburo. The plan was accepted by all<br>the party's senior leaders including Deng Xiaoping. During that<br>meeting, Zhao requested Qiao Shi, No 3 in the party and responsible for<br>security, to 'keep a close watch on how Comrade Yaobang's death might impact<br>society.' Qiao Shi is said to have replied: 'At the moment, society is<br>in pretty good shape, Things are fairly stable.'<br><br>In the afternoon of April 17, 600 students of the Chinese University of<br>Political Science and Law marched into Tiananmen Square with mourning<br>banners and wreaths. They were 10,000 by the evening.<br><br>The next day, students and onlookers poured in from Beijing University<br>and other places. Wreaths accumulated in front of the Monument to the<br>Revolutionary Heroes.<br><br>The rest is history.<br><br>It was the beginning of the largest spontaneous student revolution<br>since 1919.<br><br>During the following days and weeks, the students demanded freedom of<br>speech and the press, democratic elections, greater transparency in<br>government dealings.<br><br>The pretext for the explosion of the students' ire was the fact that Hu<br>Yaobang had been sacked though he had followed 'correct' policies. They<br>demanded that the government 'should affirm as correct Hu Yaobang's<br>views on democracy and freedom.' When the People's Daily termed the first<br>spontaneous demonstrations as 'turmoil', the events took a new turn.<br>For the students, the word 'turmoil' (dongluan) had a strong meaning in<br>Chinese reminiscent of the black days of the Cultural Revolution.<br><br>One man played a major role in the Tiananmen events -- Zhao Ziyang.<br>Having the same conviction as Hu Yaobang, he thought that a possibility of<br>political reform existed in Communist China. During the following<br>weeks, he constantly tried to negotiate a compromise with the students. This<br>could have changed the Middle Kingdom's fate.<br><br>One of his collaborators, Wu Guoguang, remembered in Time magazine: 'In<br>the wrong place at the wrong time, Zhao Ziyang did the right thing. It<br>was close to midnight on the night of May 19, 1989. China's leaders<br>were finalising their plans to declare martial law and crush the Tiananmen<br>Square democracy protests that had, in the preceding 48 hours, swelled<br>to include more than a million demonstrators.<br><br>Zhao, then general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, might have<br>remained with the commissars inside Beijing's Great Hall of the People<br>as they called in the troops. Instead, stooped with fatigue, tears in<br>his eyes, he waded into the throngs of students and in the gathering<br>darkness pleaded with them to abandon their vigil before it was too late.'<br><br>Three days earlier Zhau had received Mikhail Gorbachev, then general<br>secretary of the Soviet Union Communist Party. Was Zhao trying to emulate<br>his Soviet counterpart when he spoke to the students? The Chinese<br>leader told Gorbachev, 'Some young people now had doubts about the<br>superiority of socialism, that these doubts arose from genuine problems with the<br>Party leadership and certain entrenched habits, and that the only way<br>out for socialism was continued vigorous reforms.'<br><br>This view was certainly not shared by all in the standing committee of<br>the Politburo. Just after Zhao had met Gorbachev, an important meeting<br>was held, the verdict was split: two members were in favour of using<br>force against the students, two were for a continuation of the dialogue<br>and one, Qiao Shi, abstained.<br><br>The next day, the matter was referred to Deng Xiaoping. Zhao had told<br>Gorbachev: 'Even though Deng Xiaoping had retired from his Party posts<br>in 1987, the Party had recognised that his wisdom and experience were<br>essential and that for the most important questions he would still be at<br>the helm.'<br><br>Deng decided to use force. On May 20, the martial law order was signed<br>by Prime Minister Li Peng. Two days later, Zhao Ziyang was sacked and<br>Jiang Zemin was called from Shanghai to replace him.<br><br>During the night of June 3, Li Peng ordered the tanks to roll on the<br>Square. Between 3,000 and 10000 students lost their lives that night. The<br>Party was saved and the fate of China was sealed (at least for the next<br>few decades). One of the many ironies was that Li Peng was Zhou Enlai's<br>adopted son.<br><br>On October 17, 2004, Zhao celebrated his 75th birthday. The Human<br>Rights in China group reported: 'In the past three days large groups of<br>people have been gathering outside Zhao's Beijing home, requesting<br>permission to see him. The groups, which range in size from a dozen to upwards<br>of 100 people, seem to be made up largely of Zhao's former subordinates<br>and his close friends and relatives.'<br><br>On the same day, a group of senior Chinese citizens and Zhao's<br>supporters wrote to President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao about Zhao's<br>continuous detention: 'We strongly urge that you unconditionally and<br>immediately release Mr Zhao Ziyang from house arrest, restore his freedom,<br>and resume all his civil rights!<br><br>'No matter how the CPC (Chinese Communist Party and its government<br>would now judge the 1989 political storm and whether Mr Zhao was right or<br>wrong at that time, as a citizen of the People's Republic of China, his<br>civil rights ought to be respected and protected. Without due legal<br>procedure, his freedom and civil rights are not to be deprived. We believe<br>that you share this common view with us, and with all those who respect<br>the constitution and laws of China.'<br><br>On January 8, 2005, the media reported from Hong Kong that Zhao had<br>died. This was denied by Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan as<br>totally untrue: 'Zhao Ziyang is an old man who is over 80. He fell ill,<br>but after attentive treatment, his condition is currently stable,' he<br>told reporters. However, one can doubt the veracity of this declaration<br>(Zhao's daughter admitted he was in a coma).<br><br>Probably, like Yasser Arafat, the announcement of his death will be<br>stage managed to ensure that all arrangements for his 'non-official'<br>funeral are complete.<br><br>Already news from the BBC says, 'A thousand policemen are to be<br>deployed every morning on Beijing's Tiananmen Square to escort visitors to the<br>flag-raising ceremony. The new rules may be designed to prevent any<br>dawn protests on the square, scene of a bloody pro-democracy crackdown in<br>1989.'<br><br>All this coincides with the publication of a Gallup report which<br>concluded: 'The people of China may be far wealthier than they were a decade<br>ago, but they are not very satisfied with their quality of life, a<br>survey showed.'<br><br>In the meantime, the European Union prepares to lift the arms embargo<br>imposed after the Tiananmen events.<br><br>This will be the third time Zhao died. Politically, he died at<br>Tiananmen Square in May 1989; he probably died in a Beijing hospital earlier<br>this month; and the principles he fought for will be buried for the sake<br>of selling a few weapons more.<br></div>
