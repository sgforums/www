              <p>Perhaps getting to know her better first might help overcome the "we don't have any common hobbies" problem. Then ask her out later on if you still want to, go to her house and so on.... </p>
              <p>If you don't see someone just because they live on the other side of the island, then that might be a sign in itself.</p>
