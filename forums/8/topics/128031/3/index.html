I didn't see any..I'm getting really interested in it now..</div></blockquote>Hiya again.....<br><br>Erm.....the answer is yes and no.<br><br>Where there are animals or humans, there will always be some sort of hierarchy (is that how you spell it?).  Like me....always right at the bottom of any ladder. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I've never seen any actual ranking system in Thailand, but I've never seen any real ranking system (no belts, no colour system, no grading/testing, etc).  The only test they have is in the ring.  However, it is Thai culture that younger ones respect the older ones.....and that is quite obvious.  The older ones are the trainers too, which may help in reinforcing respect from the younger ones.<br><br>However, Thai boxers do wear head gear (like a big hoop) into the ring, which is removed just before the fight.  They also wear arm bands on their upper arms.  These are coloured and are supposed to show ranks (student, fighter, master, etc.).  But I noticed that the Thais don't give two hoots about this.  Never heard anyone talking about these coloured staff at all in Thailand.  In Thailand, everyone trains together at the same time....its freestyle and very messy, with everyone cramped in a space, all doing their own thing.<br><br>The only time I've heard of these coloured bands is in overseas muaythai schools (eg. in USA), some run by Thais.  And on websites (I guess ranking does attract people, and thus money).<br><br>At BXG, they have divided classes into 3 categories for some very good reasons:<br><br>(1) Basic - for max. concentration for beginners.  Teaches you how to strike, block, move, etc....boring!  Like doing karate kata.<br><br>(2) Intermediate (they call is FITT or something) - this is where basic techniques are put into applications, including some sparring.<br><br>(3) Advanced - Free for all....the instructor himself is a member of this class. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  There are no instructors and they just work on bags, pads, run, spar, etc.  This is like training in Thailand.<br><br>I've never taken classes at BXG, so I could be a bit wrong...but the general picture as given above should be right.  So any BXG members, please feel free to correct me.<br><br>Maybe a better person to ask would be bo liao.....I think he was a muaythai instructor before.<br><br>For your info, Samadhi_Fire has trained in some gyms in Thailand too (please correct me if I'm wrong about the coloured head and arm bands in Thailand).<br><br>Well, strike when the iron is hot.  BXG is quite a friendly place.....ask for an appointment and look around.  Visit the gym and see how they train for yourself before making any decision.  Best is to go on Tuesdays at about 8+ pm (thats when basic and intermediate classes run concurrently).<br><br>Lastly, please don't misunderstand that just because one trains in muaythai here, he can be of professional Thai fighter's standard.  Its quite impossible because Thais train very differently from us (they start training at 6-8 years old and retired at 25.....and they train 6-8 hours EVERY SINGLE DAY during those years....its 2 million times worse than NS here).<br><br>Please remember I'm a noobie nad hobbyist.....so my views may be sort of frog-in-well syndrome type.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry, I should make myself clear and summarise.....<br><br>There is no strongly observed ranking system in Muaythai.  However, where humans exist, there will always be some form of hierarchy....just whether its obvious or not and this greatly varies from gym to gym.<br><br>Comparing between different Asian martial arts.....muaythai has the least obvious ranking system.  Other Asian arts, as you know, have their members separated into belt colours, etc.<br><br>My advice is not to go to any muaythai or boxing gym which makes you bow to them or call them grandmaster, sir, etc.  Its all rubbish and erodes creativity and freedom.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>PeRsEuS,<br><br>There're pretty much alot of martial arts you can pick up for self-defence, in fact too much. Haha but ultimately, training method is important. Like bo liao pointed out, there are good TKD people out there and as coffeeortea countered,  there are also bad TKD people out there.<br><br>It all depends on how that particular school trains. Muay Thai schools generally have sound training methods, same for Kyokushin Karate and Judo Schools. All these have sparring against resisting opponents incorporated into their training. Some schools like TKD and other Karate schools have that too but have an overemphasis on point/touch sparring which might work to their detriment.<br><br>So ultimately, make sure that the school that you pick has realistic sparring and training methods, i.e. strong basics and realistic form of sparring against resisting opponents. These will give you a good assurance for your self-defence abilities.</div>
