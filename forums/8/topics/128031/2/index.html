            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by gentlerock:</div><div class="quote_body">Hey Perseus,<br><br>You portray yourself as a novice, but you've got good eyes.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  I'm a hobbyist and amatuer....but I'll air my views anyway.<br><br>Honestly and sadly, there is no such thing as self-defence.  "Self-defence" is a term invented by lawyers for court cases.  Like it or not, this is often how a street situation is won:<br><br>- Hit first (the one who hits first usually wins).<br>- Hit from behind.<br>- Have some reliable friends with you, even in a so-called "one-to-one" fight.<br>- Run damned fast - only an idiot will stand around after a fight. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I'm not kidding....the above DO happen and no martial art can teach you how to handle them.<br><br>Coming back to the arts.....its not really the art that counts, but the person.  Give a Ferrari to a lousy driver, give a Honda Civic to an expert driver......let them race through a difficult circuit.....after the Honda crosses the finish line, the novice in the Ferrari will still be wondering what the appropriate gears are for each part of the track.<br><br>Being a not-so-bright person, I favour arts which are simple, easy to grasp and definitely without all those complicated fancy helicopter acrobatics.  The simplest ones are also usually the free-style ones which leave a lot to your own creativity (eg. boxing, kickboxing, Judo, etc.)....which makes them not so monotonous.  Having said that, if you've trained hard and smart enough....any common art (TKD, Karate, Judo, etc.) can be good.<br><br>Importantly, there must be that element of human-to-human interaction - ie. contact sparring.  The closest thing you can come to fighting is contact sparring (although they're still very different).  Here's some places which have it:<br><br>- Muay Thai at BXG (<a href="http://www.bxgfitness.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bxgfitness.com</a>).<br>- Wing Chun (there's a Kiwi teaching, quite rough, but no website).<br>- Boxing at Kadir's (http://sgboxing.tripod.com/).<br>- any other place with contact sparring, regardless of the art.<br><br>I've recommended only stand-up styles this time because its best to learn stand-up fights before going into groundfighting.<br><br>Lastly, please realise that this is something you can't learn by watching, reading, etc.  You have to be out there sweating it out, drilling, training, conditioning....<br><br>Hey, if you don't mind, after your decision is made, let us know which direction you're headed. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div></blockquote>Hey I got that BXG link last night while doing research too..I think I might go for that one..although a bit expensive, after you get the moves you can always practice for free on your own somewhere.. I think most likely I'll go for Muay Thai, but am going to search around a bit more first...thanks for your information. And I agree that most fights always end up on the floor sooner or later.</div>

Look for Joe - he the friendly and humble guy who owns the place, is an enthusiast and is into other martial arts too (ie. he's not "blinded" by one art and try to promote only muaythai), and has professional fighting experience in Thailand too.<br><br>And I'm sure he will tell you exactly what I've written in my previous post about being mentally prepared for streetfighting (we've discussed it before in length during one of our bored afternoon gossips).  And he reads this forum too (which means I can't say anything bad about him <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> ).<br><br>BXG also has BJJ (groundfirghting) sometimes....in fact, they may have it tonight, 7 pm.<br><br>I drop by there sometimes to have a drink and chit-chat....so maybe I'll see you around one of these days, if you've decided on there.<br><br>My advice...just anyhow pick one and join lah....if don't like, move on lor.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, i feel that taekwondo is more for show than anything else... this is especially so if u are learning for fun and not the go-for-competition type.<br><br>U're expected to memorize and execute "patterns", which are nothing more than a combination of choreographed moves that are showy but have no practical purpose. Candidates are promoted not by their ability to overpower their opponents during free sparring, but by their ability to execute these "patterns" without making any mistakes. So it's more memory-work than anything else.<br><br>Kinda odd to see 10 year olds who are still learning to read the newspapers holding the rank of Junior Black Belt.<br><br></div>

Ultimately, as long as it gets you out alive in a middle of a fight, it is effective.<br>Take note, martial arts is not like what you see in the movies. One man wacking up 20-30 people.It is more of a case of run if possible.If not try to decieve and imobilise the enemy before he gives you any grievious injuries.<br>In fact, most martial arts, i believe will tell their students on the first lesson that their martial arts is not something for you to flaunt about or to hurt your enemy.</div>

Seniors can mean senior belts or senior in age. Hmm... there are some "senior in age" seniors who are pretty good you know, esp the more senior belt ones. Junior belts of course not very good lah - still learning the basics what. Haha the black belts instructors, besides "flip here flip there" can compete on the same level, if not higher, than the gurkhas!</div>
