One Martial art on it's own usually isn't enough.<br><br>You take up different Arts then you start to see the pros and cons of each... you can probably even start to come up with your own effective methods rather that just what's thought.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Perseus,<br><br>You portray yourself as a novice, but you've got good eyes.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  I'm a hobbyist and amatuer....but I'll air my views anyway.<br><br>Honestly and sadly, there is no such thing as self-defence.  "Self-defence" is a term invented by lawyers for court cases.  Like it or not, this is often how a street situation is won:<br><br>- Hit first (the one who hits first usually wins).<br>- Hit from behind.<br>- Have some reliable friends with you, even in a so-called "one-to-one" fight.<br>- Run damned fast - only an idiot will stand around after a fight. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I'm not kidding....the above DO happen and no martial art can teach you how to handle them.<br><br>Coming back to the arts.....its not really the art that counts, but the person.  Give a Ferrari to a lousy driver, give a Honda Civic to an expert driver......let them race through a difficult circuit.....after the Honda crosses the finish line, the novice in the Ferrari will still be wondering what the appropriate gears are for each part of the track.<br><br>Being a not-so-bright person, I favour arts which are simple, easy to grasp and definitely without all those complicated fancy helicopter acrobatics.  The simplest ones are also usually the free-style ones which leave a lot to your own creativity (eg. boxing, kickboxing, Judo, etc.)....which makes them not so monotonous.  Having said that, if you've trained hard and smart enough....any common art (TKD, Karate, Judo, etc.) can be good.<br><br>Importantly, there must be that element of human-to-human interaction - ie. contact sparring.  The closest thing you can come to fighting is contact sparring (although they're still very different).  Here's some places which have it:<br><br>- Muay Thai at BXG (<a href="http://www.bxgfitness.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bxgfitness.com</a>).<br>- Wing Chun (there's a Kiwi teaching, quite rough, but no website).<br>- Boxing at Kadir's (http://sgboxing.tripod.com/).<br>- any other place with contact sparring, regardless of the art.<br><br>I've recommended only stand-up styles this time because its best to learn stand-up fights before going into groundfighting.<br><br>Lastly, please realise that this is something you can't learn by watching, reading, etc.  You have to be out there sweating it out, drilling, training, conditioning....<br><br>Hey, if you don't mind, after your decision is made, let us know which direction you're headed. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>
