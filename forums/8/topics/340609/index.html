              <p>People do evil <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in the name of </span>religion; by itself, religion doesnt make people do stupid things. Jesus Christ rebuked Peter, who resorted to violence, and healed the Roman soldier's ear; Buddha is a pacifist, and Islam is known as religion of peace.</p>
              <p>For those who think religion causes violence, don't be dogmatic or narrow-minded. The atheistic totalitarian states (Stalin's Russia and Mao's China) have perpetrated more mass murder than any state dominated by a religious faith. Nobody's going to claim that atheists or a general lack of belief in the afterlife / supernatural / theism are the cause of violence or murder. Religious beliefs or the lack thereof isn't the problem; humans are.

              <p>People do evil <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in the name of</span> religion; by itself, religion doesnt make people do stupid things. Jesus Christ rebuked Peter, who resorted to violence, and healed the Roman soldier's ear; Buddha is a pacifist, and Islam is known as religion of peace.</p>
              <p>For those who think religion causes violence, don't be dogmatic or narrow-minded. The atheistic totalitarian states (Stalin's Russia and Mao's China) have perpetrated more mass murder than any state dominated by a religious faith. <strong>Nobody's going to claim that atheists or a general lack of belief in the afterlife / supernatural / theism are the cause of violence or murder.</strong> Religious beliefs or the lack thereof isn't the problem; humans are.

              <p>Oh i was convinced after reading a book called 'The revolution - A manifesto' by Ron Paul</p>
              <p>Heres are quotes from the book which also took findings from another book called 'Dying to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism' by Robert Pape</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>...the strongest motivation, is not religion but rather to compel modern democracies to withdraw forces from the territory the terrorists view as their homeland<br><br>... Until the US invasion of 2003 iraq had never have a suicide terrorist attack in its entire history. Between 1982 and 1986 there were 41 suicide attacks in lebanon.<br>once the US france and israel withdrew their forces from lebanon, there were no more attacks. the reason the attacks stopped, according to Pape, is that the Osama<br>Bin Ladens of the world can no longer inspire suicide terrorists, regardless of their religious beliefs ... the longer and more extended the occupation of muslim<br>territories, the greater the chances of more 9/11 attacks on the United states</p>

              <p>But ulquiorra87, why havn't we seen Tibetan Buddhist blow themselves up
              in other countries? And rioting in your own city is totally different
              from committing terrorism in other people country. Surely the Tibetan
              have been oppressed by the Chinese. Their   grievance surely must be as great if not greater than the muslims, since their homeland has been completely occupied.</p>
              <p>The difference is between Tibetan Buddhism focus on compassion and Islam focus on Jihad.</p>
              <p>And don't go telling me that we deserved to be bombed for being mean to terrorist.</p>
