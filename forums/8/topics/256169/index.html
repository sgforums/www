Lots of problems on my hand.  For example:<br><br>My girlfriend of 3 months dumped me after she found out her sister has been making advancing towards me behind her back.  I felt sad, but got back on my feet soon after, thanks to my motobike.<br><br>Then i realized, my 400cc motobike (RVF400), is terribly underpowered.  I even fixed an illegal full system but it doesn't statisfy me anymore. I want something powerful and affordable, like a CBR1000RR or perhaps a Blackbird (I like Honda bikes), but I only passed my 2a licence.  SG motobike licence system sucks.<br><br>I have no girlfriend, my only mode of transportation stinks.  What else? My finances.<br><br>All of my friends live in bungalows or condo's.  I live in a pathetic 5 room flat.  My sis and my parents both has a plasma TV and all I got is some stupid 17" tv.  I heard my parents might upgrade soon and thus I will get their's.  That's another issue; I am ALWAYS treated like second hand goods.<br><br>My bro gets to drive an Evo, but I only get to drive my dad's Mazda 3 every now and then (he wun get me my own car). Blah.<br><br>Anyway, I dun feel like sharing somemore.  ... Makes me puke.</div></blockquote>F.CK ....<br><br>Get a life.<br><br>The problem with you is that you are materialistic and too unappreciative of wot you have.<br><br>A cleaner who has less than you could live happily.<br><br>Goddamn such a person as you are.<br><br>If only you're parents had thrown you to indonesia or something and dun provide anything at all.<br><br>That should've thought you a lesson.<br><br>I dun have gf, a car, etc. yet i could live.<br><br>Live with wotever you have.<br>never expect too much or you will regret.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Your ignorance has cause u alot of negative feedback.. well pple from different background brought up differently... u should consider veri lucky to have more then wat basic needs pple had.. wake up!!! u should look around you with pple less forunate.. If u think that u are getting second hand item tried using your own strength to own one.. Taking from pple is easy, to work hard and earn yourself is another thing...</div>
