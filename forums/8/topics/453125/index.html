              <p>When travelling to more developed countries such as Japan, Taiwan, New Zealand, Europe and etc. Foreigners usually have such perception of Singapore:</p>
              <p>1) No chewing gums</p>
              <p>2) Extensive use of Capital Punishment</p>
              <p>3) Extensive use of Corporal Punishment (scrutinise by media on recent Oliver Fricker and Taiwan's loan shark runner)</p>
              <p>Look at the Japanese reaction when being informed of our strict(home corporal punishment) system: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Npd4bApF6qo">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Npd4bApF6qo </a></p>
              <p>Do
               you feel embarrassed about it? Don't you feel that the citizens(Taiwan 
              and Switzerland after extensive media report) would think negatively about us? Do you proudly present
               ur passport in their countries?</p>
              <p>I know Sg have good points too: clean and safe city; good 
              business environment(cuz low wages for skilled labour?). But are these 
              enuff to conceal our disgraceful practices?</p>
              <p>Do strict laws equal safe city? From this report: <a href="http://artmatters.info/?p=2397">http://artmatters.info/?p=2397</a>,
               out of those countries, none(except Singapore) have controversial tough
               laws. Fyi, China have SUPER strict laws; death penalty can be 
              implemented for tax fraud and many other minor crimes. Is China a safe country?</p>
              <p>Please don't misunderstood; I do like Singapore, but I owaz feel 
              that there are room for improvement, esp on our international image. Hopefully, one fine day, I can flash my passport proudly in front of any foreigner.</p>

              <p>I don't have alot of overseas frens, but I do have some; I know them from World of Warcraft(a online game). The truth is that most do not have good impression of us - Singaporean. Similar to us, we do not have good impression of China people either.</p>

              <p>To feel proud of urself, u need to have some prerequisite. If the world is criticising you, u can't possibly feel proud. It does not simply come from urself. Of cuz, you can hypnotise urself, creating a psuedo sense of supremacy.</p>
              <p>Take Osama bin Laden as an example, the whole world is condemning his actions. He obviously does not has any inferior complexity. In fact, he probably felt superior - winning a war against the world. Is that true-superiority? Can u be truly proud of him? If I were to be him, I can't possibly truly feel proud.</p>
              <p>Making a more realistic comparison: you can't feel proud of ur O level results if ur L1R5 30+. Why? People are going to criticize ur result. I don't mean he has to be embarrassed as a human, but in terms of results, it is not someting to be proud of.</p>
              <p>Similarly, I don't feel inferior(i am quite happy wif myself) as a human beings. I juz felt a liitle awkward when ppl ask me what country am I from. I cannot reply with a sense of pride.</p>

              <p>Looks like you do not have any. It is because you do not look for it in yourself.</p>
              <p>You think the Taiwanese, the Japanese and others look down on you because of your Singapore passport. It is what you think. But if you really get a census from the Taiwanese and Japanese and others you would find they approve of Singapore. If someone from the US post something like Singapore sucks, you'll take it as gospel truth. It it you who sucks. You are a tuned to what you are.</p>

              <p>It's unfair to compare Singapore(developed country) with India(developing country). Give India another 40 yrs before we attempt to compare with them.</p>
              <p>It is not about 16 inch dick. As human being, we are in no way inferior. I am assessing Singapore's image in foreigner point of view.</p>

              <p>It's not simply a random individual posting 'Singapore sux' and I take it as a hard truth. I got my conclusion from asking foreigners: ''what you know about Singapore?'' Our famous caning + chewing gum ban are first to come to mind. Of cuz, there are positive things like a safe city, efficient governemnt etc.</p>
              <p>Human Rights VS Economy which is more important? For me, human rights first, economy second.</p>
              <p>No doubt, they approve Singapore strong economy and efficient government. But are our human rights record respectable? Would u respect a country with strong economy but bad human rights?</p>
              <p>Yes, I am a perfectionist, I want to be perfect in everything. I want the world to recognise me(and us) with all positive thoughts and little criticism. I dun think there is anything wrong with that.</p>
              <p>I reiterate myself: I NEVER felt inferior as a human beings but I cannot proudly claim that I am from sg.That's all.</p>
              <p><strong>Proud of yourself and proud of ur nationality are two different things.</strong></p>
              <p>BUT I would fight war for Singapore. Why? Not proud does not mean I don't like Sg.</p>

              <p>Instead of asking others, "What do you know about Singapore," ask, "What would you like to know about Singapore?" Their impressions of a country are formed by their interactions with individuals (like YOU) as much as what they see on TV.</p>
