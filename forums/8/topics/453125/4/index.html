              <p class="MsoNormal">I remembered doing a survey on Singapore's mandatory death
              sentence. I have a pretty much mixed reaction. My qns was: 'What do you think
              of Singapore's Mandatory Death penalty?' I specifically highlighted some of the
              offences which constitute to mandatory death penalty. Many agree the law is too
              harsh; the judge should be given more discretion. Thinking back, if I rephrased
              my qns as: 'Foreigners labeled Singapore's death penalty as barbaric, do u
              agree?' My feedbacks might be very different. While many Singaporean appreciated
              some of the inappropriate practices, they cannot accept criticism from
              foreigners.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> Just recently, a PRC described(I didn't agree) us 'gangsters'
              and 'dogs' which caused an outrage over the internet. <span> </span>Singaporeans over the net were quick to unite
              and condemned actions of that PRC. If a Singaporean rephrase and ask a qns: 'Are
              Singaporean generally rude?' The feedback might be very different. Furthermore,
              I seen much more terrible criticism against PRC from Singaporean, Why are they
              unpunished?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I am not unique but I am open to criticism; regardless from
              foreigners or fellow Singaporeans. As long as there are constructive, I am very

              <p>When my topic is 'embarrassed to flash passport(identify my 
              nationality),' clearly I have the intention to bring out negative things
               about Sg. How can I be embarrassed without any negativity. Yes! u guys 
              gave me an answer(thanks alot), but it want to noe more; it didn't not 
              satisfy my curiosity. I honestly wish to noe more of ur opinion. I assumed that what forum is for. Acutally, I have alot non-political or nationality related qns to ask(not asking for help, just views), but I dun want create to many topics at the same time</p>
              <p>The passport thingy isn't a scam, It's honestly how I felt.</p>
              <p>Lastly, I am not here to create any hostility
               - I am not agitated(in case u misunderstood) in any way, in fact, I am 
              very happy to noe all of your views. Seriously, I look forward(lol) to 
              browse through this thread at times. If any of u guys feel very 
              offended, inform me, this will be my last post in this topic</p>
