              </p><p>I travel to the Republic of Korea ever so often and I can assure TS that the Singapore Passport is very well recognised and respected there.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ever so often, I might meet some Koreans that do not know where Singapore is. But once they know that Singapore citizens are from one of the very few countries in Asia that do not require visas to R.O.K., their impression of Singaporeans differs from our other Asian compatriots. Don't forget, the R.O.K. is a country where racial and country profiling/typing is still conducted on a large scale, so this is a big deal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, in the People's Republic of China, Singapore Passport holders are one of four nations not previously in the Soviet Bloc (or are post-Communist countries) that can enter P.R.C. visa-free, albeit for 15 days or less. In China, once you mention Singapore, you would likely be told "Oh, LKY", or "Singapore, oh very clean!". To them, Singapore is a post-colonial success story.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My current Singapore Passport has the stamps of entry in Paris CDG, Zürich Klöten and Milano Malpensa. I also have the exit stamps of Frankfurt (am Main), München FJS and Zürich Klöten. At all the Schengen border control points, the visa-free status of my Singapore Passport is one that I am very proud of when I see people around me who require them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While as Singaporeans, we may or may not agree with how some things are run. However, my red Singapore Passport is something I truly value. On a personal note, it does things which even the other green Korean (R.O.K.) Passport cannot do.</p>

              <p>Perhaps I didn't phrase my topic properly.</p>
              <p>My main concen is 
              not whether Singapore passport is recognised or not, is more of how 
              people view Singapore as country. Do we give a positive image to the 
              world?</p>
              <p>Why we have easy access to countries? Singapore maintain a 
              neutral standpoint(very understanable) on most contentious issue + low 
              crime rate + our open economy + export-led gdp. Therefore, it 
              necessitates our government to foster good relationship between all 
              countries. If we have easy access to their countries, they have easy 
              access to our country too. I am not criticizing it, but this isn't 
              something I am proud of. It is juz necessary for our economy.</p>
              <p>I rather boost about my clean and safe city. I am grateful about it too.</p>
              <p>Anyway it's good to know that alot of Singaporeans are proud of themselves.</p>

              <p>Bcuz I am going overseas soon, and today I was packing and trying to find my pp. Usually when I am going(or about to go) overseas then I start thinking whether am I genuinely proud to be a Singaporean. To me, the 'flash passport' part, is more of identifying ur nationality than considering usefulness my passport.</p>
              <p>I typed the opening thread with my pp beside me. Thinking back, 'Are you proud to be Singaporean?' is indeed a more appropriate title.</p>

              <p>Are strict laws the main and only contributing factor to low crime? Saudi Arabia has strict laws, there isn't anywhere safe.  Japan has low crime - lower homicide rate than Sg according to wikipedia - but no tough laws. Are we undermining other factors - good education, strong economy, efficient police force, efficient government - contributing to low crime?</p>

              <p>Nigho, when you are overseas please tell everyone you meet you
                  are from Singapore, they will  be happy to meet you and want
                  to know more about Singapore.</p>
              <p>I know for sure. I have been overseas and they all know a little
                  of Singapore. And most have high regard for Singapore.</p>
              <p>The problem is you, not the passport or Singapore or the
                  people's perception of Singapore. There are more reasonable people
                  in the  world than silly people.</p>
              <p>And if you talk bad about your own country, only then they will
                  look down at you.</p>
              <p>If someone condemn Singapore and you say nothing, that person
                  will laugh at you, and the on-lookers will pity you.</p>

              <p>I have been to many major cities around the world, those that aren't close to me, have nv ever utter a word of criticism against Sg. Only those who are reasonably close to me, would tell me what they truly feel.</p>

                   someone criticises Singapore, I will only defend if his statement is
