              <p>I just came back from the Yeosu Expo 2012, where pretty much every country in the world had its pavilion or exhibition space at the Expo. While the theme of the Expo was about water (and water conservation / saving / or whatever you call it) and the Koreans wanted to show off their supposed excellent water retention abilities, the three countries with the highest number of visitors to their pavilions were the Russian Federation, the United States of America, and Singapore.<br><br>The queue for the Singapore Pavilion was more than an hour long!

              <p> </p>
              <p>But the point I want to make here is that at the Yeosu Expo, tiny Singapore could compare with the mighty two superpowers in terms of visitors. The Singapore "brand" is very, very well respected out there. While I can't speak much about the perception of Singapore and Singaporeans in America, Australia and Africa, I'm pretty darn sure the Singapore "brand value" is quite high in North-East Asia. As I said earlier, Singapore is viewed as a post-colonial success story — a global city without natural resources but built through sheer manpower and FDI itself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For all that, I give STB (Singapore Tourism Board) the due credit, though personally I f**king hate that organisation. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              <p>It's the "me versus other Singaporeans" mentality at work again... typical. What makes you think that people like yourself are rare? If there's another thing about Singapore that I do not like, it's delusions of superiority like this.</p>
              <p>Every country has its skeletons, including those you mentioned, it's just that you don't know them intimately. Every society has an aspect its people are ashamed of. If everyone thinks like you no one would dare show off their passport.</p>
