            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I read rich dad poor dad recently and I find it quite interesting. Below is a summary of what it is written<br><br>Differences between a rich person and a poor person<br><br>The poor person has a habit of putting his brain to sleep when it comes to money matters, the rich person had a habit of exercising his brain when it comes to money matters.<br><br>The poor person thought that the rich should pay more in taxes to take care of the poor.<br><br>The rich person say taxes punish those who produce and reward those who don't produce.<br><br>The poor say study hard so you can find a good company to work for.<br><br>The rich say study hard so you can find a good company to buy.<br><br>The poor say when it comes to money, play it safe, don't take risk.<br><br>The rich say learn to manage risk.<br><br>The poor is concerned about pay rises, retirement plans, medical benefits, sick leave, vacation leave and other peaks. the idea of job protection and job benefits seems more important than the job.<br><br>The rich person believe in total financial self-reliance.<br><br>The poor struggle to save a few dollars.<br><br>The rich simply created investments.<br><br>The poor is always thinking about how to write a better resume so that he can find a good job.<br><br>The rich thinks about how to write strong business and financial plans so he could create jobs.<br><br>The poor say he is not interested in money.<br><br>The rich say money is power.<br><br>If you are a person with no guts, you will live all your life playing it safe, doing the right things, saving yourself for some events that never happen. You die a boring man. You will have lots of friends who really like you because you are such a nice hardworking person. You spend a life playing it safe, doing the right things but you know in your heart that you let life push you into submission. Deep down you were terrified of taking risks. You really wanted to win but your fear of losing was greater than the excitement of winning.. deep inside you will know you didn't go for it. You chose to play it safe.<br><br>Its fear that keeps people working at work. The fear of not paying bills. The fear of being fired. the fear of having not enough money. The fear of staring over. That is the price of studying to learn a professional or trade and than working for money. Most people become a slave to money and than become angry with their boss.<br><br>An asset is something that puts money in my pocket.<br><br>A liability is something that takes money out of my pocket.<br><br>A intelligent person hires person more intelligent than him.<br><br>The middle class find itself in a constant state of financial struggle. Their primary income is through wages and as their wages increase so do their taxes. Their expenses tent to increase in equal increments as their wages and hence the term "the rat race".<br><br>Wealth is a person's ability to survive so many days forward or if I stop working today, how long could i survive?<br><br>The rich buy assets. The poor only have expenses. The middle class buy liabilities that they think are assets.<br><br>The mistake in becoming what you study is that too many people forgot to mind their own business.They spend their lives minding someone else business and making that person rich.<br><br>The rich focus on their asset column while everyone else focus on their income statement.<br><br>The ideas of "I need a increment. I need a promotion. I am going to study more so I can get a better job. I am going to work overtime. I need a second job" focus on the income column and will only help a person become more financially secure if the additional money is used to purchase income generating assets.<br><br>Keep your expenses low, reduce your liabilities and build a base of solid assets. Start building a solid asset column before getting married, buying a house, having kids etc and getting stuck in a risky financial position, clinging on to a job and buying everything on a credit.<br><br>Real assets fall into these categories:<br><br>Business that do not need my presence. I own them but they are managed by other people. If I have to work there, its not a business. It is my job.<br><br>Stocks.<br><br>Bonds.<br><br>Mutual funds.<br><br>Income generating real assets.<br><br>Keep your daytime job, be a hardworking employee but keep on building your asset column.<br><br>Rich person buy luxuries last while poor and middle class person buy luxuries first.<br></div>
