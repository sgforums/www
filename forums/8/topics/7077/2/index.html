            <div class='col-md body'>Today, I thought abt him again...And I became depress.  I was depress because I miss his company, I miss hearing his voice, but I didn't feel any pain and I wasn't hurt.  I asked myself, what will make me happy?! Why am I so hang up on this situation?!  I pondered about this for couple hours and I finally came to a conclusion.  I love him w/ all my heart.  When you love someone you want that person to be happy.  I once told him that I want him to be happy with or without me.  Therefore, I will be happy if he is happy.  Until now, I am still very unclear on the reason why things ended up this way, but I have faith in him.  I trust him to do the right thing.  So, if being friends will make him happy, then I will become his friend.  If he was to break up with me because he found someone new, I am okie with it.  Why?! HECK! What am I thinking?! This person cheated on you and you are okie with it?!  Yes, I am because if he did choose the other person over me then it must mean that she is more suitable for him.  That we are having problems with the relationship.  I know he will be happy with someone more compatible with him.  Someone that can give him what he needs and someone that can be there for him as needed.<br><br>And even if he didn't break up with me cuz of someone else, the he must have been uncomfortable while he was with me and it caused him a lot of heartache and pain.  So, if ending things will make him feel more confortable and happy, I am willing to support him nontheless...<br><br>I guess I am pass the stage of blaming him for what happened already.  I was hurt before because I feel betrayed, I feel cheated, and I can't believe he has the heart to hurt me like this.  I am now in a stage of reasoning...where I am not hung over why this relationship didn't work out, I am in the stage where I know what I need to do, I know what I want to do to be happy.<br><br>------------------<br>Float like a butterfly...Sting like a bee...</div>

Love should be both way, I agree, otherwise the relationship will never go far. To me, I want a long and lasting relationship, and to rush into a relationship is not going to help in anyway. I know where I had gone wrong, and I am willing to change my mindset.<br><br>Yup, I do not want to buy love, what I want is sincere love from her. If she can't give me that, maybe she is not the girl for me. I feel I need to have a good talk with her, about the whole issue, she had not been clear with me on this, it's about time I know how she feel.<br><br>I dun think I am afraid of losing her to another guy now, she is not mine.. she is free to choose who she want to be with. I told her before, if she is not happy with me, she should let me know and I will be happy to let her go but she never tell me she wanted that.. so I assume she is happy with me.<br><br>Unconditional love.. something I want to explore for now.. to find out if it's within my means to attain.<br><br>I do not feel hurt or sad now even though I make myself not to call her. Yes, I miss her voice, her touch, and her fragrant. But I believe I need to find myself first before I can progress.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>NaiveGer, I think the harder you try to forget certain things, the more they will come back to haunt you. I really *pei-fu* your open mind in not blaming him for whatever reason he choose to give up this relationship. Remember that it may not be your loss.<br><br>As for now, you need to carry on with your life. Family and friends will be your best support now. Try picking up some new interest to occupy your mind. Fill your life with meaningful activities, like volunteer work? sports? work? leisure... you are bound to think of him at times, or get reminded.. but this is only natural.. time will take care of everything... meanwhile if you dont want to face him, then dont.. do everything at your pace  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>You are my first star at night, I'd be lost in space without you<br>I'll never lose my faith in you,<br>How will I ever get to heaven if I do</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dearest Naive,<br><br>It has been at sometime since I post something in the forum serously, but was life always serious? *smiles* I still apologise for the neglect I have shown during this time, work does take my mind off the forums sometimes, but not off you people.<br><br>Anyway, all big brother here can say is that life is always the ups and downs, with each up we learn how to get up there, and with each down we learn how to handle it. Those who can't get up from the down pharse will remain confused and unhappy for longer periods of time, that's all. I normally dun give advice...for I believe that woman like you, knows what to do, and dun need meddlesome man like me to teach and nag at you. But I believe there are two things you need, time and a listening ear. The latter I am sure you have many as we can see from the posts up there and you have all the time that you need. Perk up, like Ju said, go do something that will make you happy. You do not forget the pain, you just grow numb to it and laff it off later. I always do, and all the "scars" I have gathered, enriched my life with experiences I am proud of. And I like it that way.<br><br>Well, better not be lenghty, least you find me a bore...just say hello when you next see me around online, or when you come to Singapore, I just like to know that you are still around, it lights up my life.</div>
