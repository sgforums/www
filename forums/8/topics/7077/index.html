            <div class='col-md body'>hmmmmm....I dunno how to start this thread...but I just feel that there is many thots inside of me...bursting out...I just feel like telling someone or at least letting someone know abt it...<br><br>Something happened to me lately (I do appreciated it if you ppl don't guess what happened..thanks)  I have felt that my world was slowly falling apart...After the incident, I have asked myself a lot of questions...some I found conclusions for...some not...<br><br>I was upset becuz I felt betrayed by someone I really care abt...someone that was very special to me...Until now, I still do...I was talking to my dad and I asked him, why do ppl lie?!  He replied, Lying is only a tool ppl use, it's the intention they have that is most impt.  There are many kind of lies...everywhere in the world, ppl lie.  But lying w/ a good intention is different from those w/ ulterior motives...Someone might have to lie to you to keep you from getting hurt, and some might lie to you just to get you do do what he wants you to do.  So, the question I asked myself was, would I want to have the person I love lie to me to prevent me from getting hurt?!  It really depends...if the relationship is over, i would appreciate that the person tells me the truth...<br><br>"date as if he's not the last guy on earth"  I was told that this will increase self-confidence.  If I was to do this I will not hope or expect for anything from the other person or from the relationship.  I won't make plans for the future and live it day by day.  If there's no hope then there's no depression.  The higher I get in a relationship the harder I fall.  This might seem a bit pessimistic, but it's how I feel. I will not allow myself to get to this point again.<br><br>I feel that love is not everything.  Before I used to think that my meaning for life is to find someone I truely love and to shower him w/ all my love.  Start a family w/ him and do everything like the fairy tale.  But, I feel it's wrong now.  There are many things in life that I should treasure besides my love.  I have family, the wonderful world, green grass, beautiful flowers, the ocean, the sky, stars, everything...every little thing...<br><br>Why is it so hard to recover from a broken heart?!  For me, I feel that it's because I truely loved that person, I trusted him with everything, including my fragile heart.  I put in so much effort to keep the magic, but at the end the love turns sour and I feel that I have been betrayed, been cheated of my feelings, and I am left w/ nothing.  Someone once told me love doesn't turn sour, what sour is when the one is out of love.  I totally agree!  If the love is there things will have a way of working itself out, but if it is not, then there is nothing we can do about it.  If it was never meant to be yours then it will never be yours no matter how hard you try...<br><br>Today, I did some volunteer service.  I feel very good abt myself, very useful, very  proud of myself.  I feel we are all very fortunate to have what you have.  Take some time, sit down, and look arnd. Look at everything you have, your computer, internet access, clothing, food, family, everything!  There are many ppl out there that don't even have half of the things we have, and here we all are wanting something that is not necessary, here we are fretting abt what we want or what we don't have, fretting about a sour relationship, fretting abt being lied to, fretting abt feel betray...<br><br>Many ppl ask me if I am really naive.  If you know me and understand me you will know the answer.  Lately, I have also ask myself that question.  I am very naive at times.  When it comes to ppl I trust, I am.  I trust them to make the right decision, I trust them with my heart, my feelings, and to some even my life.  I will believe everything they tell me.  I can't find a reason to doubt them or for them to lie to me.  To them I am very vulnerable.  So, I guess until you understand me, you won't know...<br><br>Gosh! I feel like I am just babbling on and on...I really dunno if you guys even understand me, but I guess if you have gotten this far you must be confuse to death! =P  anyways..thanks for lending me an ear or an eye, since this is the interent... =P<br><br>PS: I would like to ask you a favor and don't guess or confront me of what happened...I was really hurt by it and I don't want to be reminded of it again...thanks!<br><br>Yearning for familiarity, comfort,<br>yet... the search for an unknown continues...<br>Reloading, as a blank is dispensed...<br>Refreshing, as the quest never ends...<br>Counting, as memories fade to the next...<br>Hoping, to prove the myth of perfection...<br>Discovering, it was all just a  d-r-e-a-m . . .<br><br>------------------<br>Float like a butterfly...Sting like a bee...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Naive,<br>Well, I might not in the best of position to advice, but there are some thoughts I would like to share with you.<br><br>I never felt good about lying, even hiding my feeling is deem to be insincere to me. I want to share my ups and downs with the person I love. Some of my sorrows might be related to her, and it's tough whether I should let her know or not. Letting her know might cause more hurt to her and myself, not letting her knows will mean that the relationship just carry on as per normal, till maybe one day I can't stand it anymore and just burst out. I do not want that to happen, so I chose to let her know, and now I end up hurting her and she want me to cool down and think for myself. In future, I might be a bit selective on sharing my feelings.<br><br>Yes, having hope on something is one thing that can crash a person hard. The more you hope for, the more you will be hurt. Sometimes I wish I can live each day by itself, not wanting to hope for more. Yet subconsciously, the urge just surface.<br><br>I still have the idea that meaning for life is to find that special someone to shower my love and care for. But there are other things beside that. This is a beautiful and sad world. Some people live in luxury, and able to enjoy every bits of their life, while others have to struggle just to survive.<br><br>I used to do volunteer also, and I really enjoyed myself. I feel that I am a useful person, and I am playing a part in making someone else happy, and the best part is I dun even have to know the person, just the thought that I had made the day for someone is good enough.<br><br>Life is short, how much more time do I have left in this world? I dunno, but one thing I do know is in this very limited time available, I want to enjoy my life.. to make my heart contented. To know when the moment arrive that I have lived a meaningful life.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Luf,<br><br>I was like you too.  I feel that I shld always tell the person I love what I am feeling, wheter it's happiness or sadness.  I don't believe in hiding my feelings to the person I want, to someone I want to spend the rest of my life with.  He may or maybe be the source of the happiness or sadness, but I would like to tell him nonetheless, and I ask for him in return to do the same.  I feel that lots of misunderstand occur when the couple lacks communication.  Anyways, now I feel differently, I feel that I shld not let go of all my feelings to someone, cuz it will only make myself more vulnerable to pain.

I believe a lot in communication and understanding for a relationship to work.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi NaiveGirl,<br><br>it is 7.00 am now in the UK and i have not slept ! haha but i think you are not only hoping someone to read your post but also to reply you as well ? At least if i were u, i will like someone to reply me as soon as possible. So i decided not to keep you waiting.<br><br><blockquote>I have felt that my world was slowly falling apart...<br></blockquote>[/b]<br><br>don't worry, things have to fall apart before you can rebuild them. You heard of this phrase :<br><br>si(3) er(2) hou(4) sheng(2) ?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>i would appreciate that the person tells me the truth...<br></strong></blockquote>yes, truthfulness is the most important. I always make sure that i am truthful.<br><br>In the past, i discovered that lying is a great tool (like your dad had said) which can get me what i want easily. But gradually, i discovered that i am just weaving a HUGE web and things get more and more complicated everytime i lie. And lying is not only for that instance it is for LIFE. You have to keep on lying .... new lies to cover your old lies ... it is never ending.<br><br>Truthfulness sets me free.<br><br>It truly hurts when our loved ones lie to us. And they can hurt us more than anyone else because we do not have any defence against our loved one, we are so fragile and vulnerable to them.<br><br>I myself have been "betrayed" by a close friend before and i can understand how you feel. You wish things have not turn out this way but reality proves you wrong and you are so helpless about it and all you can do is to reflect on your own life.<br><br>The hurt is done and the lesson learned. But I hope you do not give up on people.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>If there's no hope then there's no depression.<br></strong></blockquote>yes, you are right. But you will have no true happiness too. What is life without hope ? It's like a well without water, dry and empty.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>This might seem a bit pessimistic, but it's how I feel.<br></strong></blockquote>I understand, i felt this way too when my fren betrayed me.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>There are many things in life that I should treasure besides my love.  I have family, the wonderful world, green grass, beautiful flowers, the ocean, the sky, stars, everything...every little thing...<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>yes ! there are many things around us which we always neglect. One is our parents, know them before they are gone for good ..... I have never really tried to know them well, i am trying to now. They are the ones who brought me to this world and yet i know so little of them.<br><br>And yes, every little thing matters. I am glad you have realised that  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Why is it so hard to recover from a broken heart?!<br></strong></blockquote>because it is broken and it is a <span style="font-style: italic;">heart</span>.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Today, I did some volunteer service.  I feel very good abt myself, very useful, very  proud of myself.<br></strong></blockquote>that's great ! I always think that the person who benefit most from social work is the volunteer herself. There is a spiritual gain.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>There are many ppl out there that don't even have half of the things we have, and here we all are wanting something that is not necessary, here we are fretting abt what we want or what we don't have, fretting about a sour relationship, fretting abt being lied to, fretting abt feel betray...<br></strong></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> yes, life is wonderful isn't it ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Sometimes we need some setbacks to bring us back to basics.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>I am very naive at times.  When it comes to ppl I trust, I am.<br></strong></blockquote>well, i will just like to say that the amount of trust we put in people should be directly proportional to the degree of understanding we have of them.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>I really dunno if you guys even understand me, but I guess if you have gotten this far you must be confuse to death! =P<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>yes, i do understand and i am not confused though i am extremely sleepy now ! hahah!<br><br>Lastly, i will like to add that no matter what happens in your life, good or bad, they are still part of your life. <strong>Accept ALL of them</strong>, then your life can be complete. With a complete life, then you'll be able to enjoy complete happiness.<br><br>Good luck to you  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Everyone,<br><br>Just some of my views as well.<br><br>I have always thought that honesty after lying is the best policy for yourself only. In the course of telling the truth, you MIGHT hurt someone else, although you alleviate the guilt inside you. None the less, some situations and people are worth bearing this burden for, so you still go ahead and lie. You also have to take into account what sort of person you are dealing with, whether they are those that can handle the whole truth or those who really prefer to remain ignorant despite saying that they want to be honest.<br><br>As well, I sometimes think that hope is overrated. Still, try as much as I want to be rational, logical, down to earth whatever, I will still hope, because often its the only thing that gives us strength to go on. If its not meant to be, fine. The important thing is then to recover from this hurt and disappointment, hopefully being much the wiser to handle similar situations in the future.<br><br>I would also like to say that being thankful for things around you doesn't preclude wanting to look for a good relationship. To borrow a word usually used for IRC and ICQ, you can "multitask." By all means, treasure the things in life around you, but I don't think treating love/ relationships with less than the respect and effort that it takes to make it work, is not the right way to go.<br><br>Naivegirl,<br><br>These are just my own views. Feel free to disagree. I won't pretend to know the answers to your problems, but I hope reading another viewpoint, even a one different from yours, can help you better deal with life in general in the future.<br><br>I hope you recover soon.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by pacman (edited 24 April 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thank you all for the words of encouragement, but you all shld know that it's easier said then done.  Time and time again I tell myself that it's not worth all the pain and suffering, but time and time again I can't get over the fact that I was/felt betrayed...it's just take time.  Time can heal all wounds rt?!  Actually my view on that is that it can't!  I can only give to time to recover but the scar will always be there...<br><br>Alex: Yes, setbacks will only inspire me to be stronger in the future...but it just seems like time and time again, this happens...<br><br>Carrots: rainbow?!  Is there a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow?! ahahhahaha<br><br>Luf: Yes, I do believe we share similar views on this topic.  I have learned a very harsh lesson b4, so from that time on I have shared my feelings w/ the person i love. My ideal relationship will be one where we can talk forever! abt anything...nonsense, sweet nothing, feelings, regardless sadness or happiness.  In my previous relationship, I have always told him what I am feeling, if i am hurting, if he is hurting me, or even ask him if i am hurting him in anyway...I guess not everyone is like us...it's very hard for someppl to express themselves, At times it's hard for me also, but I then will find another way to express, it might not be in person or on the phone, maybe jsut a letter or an email...to me a relationship is not only based on trust and love, but also communication...<br><br>Jub: kekekke!!! Yeah, I did go to LA and visit the theme park.  I went to Magic Mountain and scream as loud as I can, my throat damn sore now.  I was scream so loud that even my friend said I was hurting his ear.  I feel screaming helps a lot, it let out the anger and frustration.  I also visit Disneyland...saw many happy cheerful kids there...it made me feel good since kids so carefree and innocent, at times i wish i can turn back the hand of time and be a kid again...<br><br>LittleMan: Thanks for staying up and cheering me up!  =D  It's good to know that even ppl that doesn't know you care for you..you gave me a warm feeling in my heart! Thanks!  I know my parents too well! ahhahaa so well you won't even believe it! =P  Yes, I have accept all the ppl in my life regardless.  They are those who made me who I am.<br><br>Pacman: yes, you are rt! Lying can actually be a good thing.  Like my dad said, it's all abt the intention that one has behind the lie.  Hoping, I still hope, and I won't stop hoping cuz like you said, life is meaningless if one stop hoping.  What I learned is that I will not expect from my partner.  I will not expect him to treat me the same way and I won't accept it for him to hope or at least tell me what he hopes that the future have in store for us cuz only time can tell.<br><br>Moose: True Love,  I think it does exist, but one will only know on the day he/she dies.  True love doesn't mean the one you spend your life time with, it can be someone that you know for just a short period of time.  The most impt thing is that you were true to yourself and you have no regrets on whatever you did when you where in the relationship.  Maybe it's possible to have more than one true love...<br><br>Asure: Yes, I know you and you know me...very well indeed.  I know it's just a passing stage for me now, but it's just hard to cope w/ it just now,  I know I will be better soon, and I know you know I will be better soon also! hahahahha you know...i know...we all know... =P  I still believe in true love, just cuz i haven't find it in this relationship doesn't mean i will never rt?!<br><br>Tet: YES! I am a strong girl! I will be able to get through this, but it will just take time..Thanks for your concern.  *NaiveGirl shares her lollipop with Tet*<br><br>Today...I did spend time thinking abt what happened...it depresses me, and I asked myself how can I keep myself away from thinking abt it?!  I keep myself busy, but every little thing reminded me of what happened...<br><br>------------------<br>Float like a butterfly...Sting like a bee...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Naive,<br>I am into my 2nd day of cooling down.. something she suggested and I set for myself. I want to spend these 5 days thinking what went wrong and basically to give myself some time to think things thru.<br><br>After talking to my friends and having some time on my own to think. I have sort out something I hadn't seen myself. So far I had done quite alot of things for her, but sometimes when I do things for her, I expected something, either wanting to see her happy, to win her heart or to ask for a status. This is not sincere, not totally true love. The problems arised becoz I had expected something and when I didn't get what I want, I am disappointed and hurt. Ideally, I would have done those things and be happy about them, either she appreciate it or not. What matters is not to expect things, and be happy doing things for her.<br><br>There is absolutely no way I can always be sweet and nice to her all the time, what will happen if I cannot meet her due to work or I did something that disappoint her. It will depend how deep our love and understanding for each other is. It might be a good thing to know her more, to let us discover each other first before actually commiting to each other. Why the hurry?? If it's to be, it will be.. if not, so what if we are attached now.<br><br>How I wish I can be so rational everytime. A new concept just strike me, unconditional love. How to love someone and not expect anything in return? That seem to be the ultimate love a person can give.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Luf,<br><br>Yes, I do believe problems starts to develop once a person feels like he/she<br>is the one giving in more than the other partner.  In a relationship, one<br>shld give and take.  It doesn't work if one person just take and the other<br>just give.  Love is a two-way street.  I don't believe in mutual love, but<br>in your case i feel like you like her more than she does.  It's just an<br>opinion...<br><br>When you decided to give someone something, don't expect to have something<br>back in return.  If you were to expect something in return, expect to be<br>happy, cuz you like this person and you have the chance to show her your<br>feelings for her.  You can't win someone's heart by giving her things and<br>even if you can she is too materalistic rt?! Why would you want someone like<br>that? A status...Like said above, Love is a two-way street she also must<br>have feelings for you to give you a status.  Many guys asked me before to<br>give them a chance...to me, giving someone a chance means to take<br>responsiblities, maybe to her, she's just not ready to take the<br>responsiblities yet...Did you have a talk w/ her abt this yet?  Ask her,<br>what are you to her now? in there any possibities in the future? If she<br>tells you that she doesn't feel the same way towards you then don't pursue<br>the relationship, just stay as friends, it's hard i know, but it's better<br>this way.<br><br>There is no hurry to rush into a relationship, but i think the problem you<br>have is that you are afraid to miss-out.  That one day she will fall for<br>another guy instead of you, it's the fear of lossing what you have...<br><br>Unconditional love, it's hard to acheive that, but I am sure if you love<br>that person enuff you can do it.  It hards, but it's something you will do<br>subconsciously, so at that point you won't even be thinking that you are<br>hurting or suffering...get what i mean?<br><br>------------------<br>Float like a butterfly...Sting like a bee...</div>
