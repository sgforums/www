Those 2 guys just go yaba-yaba non-stop - what makes them think we are more interested in listening to their often dimwit opinions than listening to songs?  Throw in those hopelessly uncreative commercials they're paid to repeat every half hour, selling lies about how they're going to book this condo unit, how wonderful is that breath refreshening oral strips, ... etc, etc, and you get really turned off by their running commentary on anything and everything.<br><br>OK, so FD's not half as bad as GO.  This morning GO's trying to tell pple that Singapore's going to have a casino, just becos he dreamt about it.  The whole gawdamned country knows we're going to have a casino, so stop all these personal and self-glorifying trash talk, OK?  And what's that he said this morning?  Yeah, right - if people are stupid enough to gamble their lives away then they deserve it, right?  Just becos it wouldn't affect him or his loved ones, right?  What about the families, the children, especially?  Should the innocents and the defenceless suffer?  I'm not here to start another casino debate, but the way he dismissed concerns and worries about social costs of casino is just plain selfish and pathetic!<br><br>At least FD takes criticisms on the chin, whether or not they're justified.  GO is just so full of himself it's beginning to irritate the hell out of me every time I tune in in the morning.

At least they could have invited more callers, but everythingÂ’s on sms nowadays, and you just get so sick of their voices and especially GOÂ’s cynical and derisive comments.<br><br>The alternatives?  P10 and P98 not really my cup of tea, guess itÂ’s the oldies at 90.5 thenÂ…<br></div>
