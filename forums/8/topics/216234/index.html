            <div class='col-md body'>Army unveils plan to equip infantryman for tomorrow's wars<br><br>The plan, termed 'F-INSAS' (Future Infantry Soldier as a System), is based on the prevailing trends which indicate 'infantry-centric' pattern of warfare will predominate in the present and even for the foreseeable future at all strategic, operational and tactical levels, the Director General Infantry Lt Gen K Nagaraj said here.<br><br>'F-INSAS' is designed to enhance the survivability, lethality and the mobility of a soldier,' he said, n a presentation on the concluding day of the Army-Industry Partnership Meet-2003 here yesterday.<br>A modular weapon system, an integrated helmet assembly, a portable computer-radio, protective clothing and other individual equipment form the components of the F-INSAS, Lt Gen Nagaraj said, stressing that a basic postulate of the plan is the soldier's interest.<br><br>''We do not intend to burden the soldier. We are looking at a maximum total weight of 20 to 25 kg for all this equipment,'' he pointed out.<br><br>Listing the other infantry modernisation programmes being undertaken globally like the US 'Land Warrior: the First Integrated Soldier Fighting System for Dismounted Infantrymen,' the German 'Future Infantryman System' (IdZ), the French 'Fassin a equipment et liasons integres' (FASIN) and the British 'Future Integrated Soldier Technology' (FIST), which differs from the previous in focussing on an infantry section in the dismounted close combat role than an individual soldier, he said all these sought to use 'cutting edge technologies' for the automated, electronic battlefield of the future.<br><br>Quote:Scientific advisor to the defence minister has indicated that a project to implant chips on soldiers will be demonstrated in two years.<br><br>Quote:He said this entire kit would not cost very much and would enhance the performance of the soldier operating in low intensity conflict scenario and save his life in case of injury.<br><br>This would be achieved by a vest, fitted with communication systems and mini-radio network, now being developed by the DRDO.<br><br>Similarly, the US had shown keen interest in learning from India's experience in bio-medical sciences and environmental physiology.<br><br>India was perhaps the only country in the world where its soldiers performed military operations in as varied terrain as burning deserts and freezing glaciers.<br><br>The two countries had also agreed to cooperate in the development of a vaccine for biologicial warfare.<br><br>The DRDO had developed the expertise in countering chemical warfare, including detection kits and personal and collective protection for soldiers in a nuclear environment.<br><br>A high-powered Government body had given the go-ahead to the DRDO to store such chemical agents at designated spots all over the country. However Dr Atre refused to divulge details about their exact location.<br><br>Elaborating upon the advances made by the DRDO in the field of life sciences Dr Atre said the DRDO would offer 18 pharma products to the country's pharmaceutical majors on Wednesday with free technology transfer.<br><br>These products include carbogen, a mixture of oxygen and carbon dioxide gas to minimise adverse effects of noise on the hearing system, herbal protector against radiation and processed food products, he said.<br><br>Quote:ndian troops to go hi-tech soon<br><br>April 07, 2004 22:13 IST<br><br>Under an "aggressive" modernisation drive, the army is acquiring latest gadgets so that it can be on par with the armed forces of developed countries.<br><br>Ballistic helmets, equipped with infrared night-vision devices and strong torchlights, are currently under trial and can soon become a part of the soldier's dress, Director General of Ordnance Services Lt Gen R S Shahrawat said in New Delhi on Wednesday.<br><br>The army is also contemplating equipping soldiers with global positioning system on watches, which will help in identifying soldiers' locations.<br><br>The overall uniform and footwear of the troops will also be upgraded, Gen Shahrawat said.<br><br>"Some of the equipment planned to be inducted is under trial to check their performance and see whether these meet our requirements," he said.<br><br>The government has also cleared acquisition of more bullet-proof jackets and helmets for troops involved in counter-terrorism operations in Jammu and Kashmir and the Northeast, he added.</div>
