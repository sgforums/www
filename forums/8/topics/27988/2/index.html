            <div class='col-md body'>sound quite nice..for people who listen to the music for the first few time.. quite catchy too ..<br>but for your recording.. erm . i think when u do your recording rather too 'airy' meaning too much reverb into the music when u sing.. u should try to make it sound 'cleaner'....<br>for your structure of your music .. the verse and chours should be more define ... maybe u repeat your lyrics the wrong time or i cannt make out which one is the verse again ... add a bridge will be good to change the mood.. .. 3 mins 11 sec  erm abit too short...but maybe the contest allow u to send in a 4 mins demo .. this i am not too sure ...<br>maybe can add a light 4 bar guitar unplug solo in the music.. so to let people fall into the music.. ..<br>if i am a judge of this contest... i feel like this song have put in effort.. but still very hard to commercialise it.. music is about commercialising .. will people listen to it... and can sing with it..  abit cannot catch up with the time... rather bring me back to collin raye time again with the structure of your chords...<br>good for those 'ming ge chan ting stuff'<br>all this is just my thinking lah ... take it easy and wish u can get thru it.. cause writing song is very hard... i done so many song before also .. but most of the time fail too ..  but i play in the band that a different thing.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Just that i repeat that part twice and later move on to another. Well, actually for this song, i wanted to make it more like a story telling music rather than a<br>( Verse1, Verse2, Prechorus, Chorus, Bridge)<br><br>*hah* anyway, thanks for your feedback. *hah* I will see it as a way to improve myself next time. *hah*<br>One more thing. There are actually three vital characters in this song. Thats firstly God (Surprising ah ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  ), that girl and lastly myself. Well, I would say that this song is one that ministers to me. I'm a christian you see. During the breakup, it was really an extrememly painful period for me. (Cuz she's my first anyway) But there is this God who kinda changed the way I felt, the way I perceived things and made me secure as time passes. So most certainly, God must be in this song! I know this may sound really weird and 'duddd' to you but its a personal and very intimate experience for myself. Yah. =)<br><br>I realised that i would write songs, quotes and draw weird pictures during my post-breakup period. And this song is written when I'm kinda recovering and being able to see a bigger picture about love and relationships. What about you guys ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

I used sound forge to record this. *hah* I downloaded the program from KazAA ( The orginal one cost about 400 bucks ! Too expensive liao !!!)<br>I agree that it sounds airy. But that was after i modified it because i felt that the first recording sounds very mono and dull so i decided to input a little bit of effect.
