              <p>It is the latter 1. The card was already used by some1 else even before i used it. And it has always been in my possession all this while. Neither did I give 2 some1 else or disclosed my PIN to anybody.</p>
              <p>I agree with u IceBoy. By right, the bank should be responsible but I am not optimistic about the compensation. </p>

              <p>i've read abt ATM fraud in some emails some time back. they say the fraudsters will insert a device into the card slot, and then it in turn cause your card to get stucked. but they could easily retrieve your card without u knowing.</p>

              <p>the fraudsters could have peeped at you keying in the pin number, and once they have your card after you left, they can withdraw the money.</p>

              <p>Hi S0nic, </p>
              <p>It did happen in Singapore before, and that is the reason why a green-coloured external device has been installed on some ATM machines a few months back.</p>
              <p>As for CarterM, I am sorry to hear about your loss, but unfortunately, it is highly unlikely that you will get your money back, even if the fraudster is caught. I will strongly suggest that you change your PIN to prevent any further mishaps from happening.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>Did the bank or police ask you for the last few transactions you did with your ATM card before it was retained?</p>
              <p>Most likely your card was cloned.</p>
              <p>By the classic, fake card slot at ATM with camera overhead.</p>
              <p>Or during NETS payment the cashier, secretly swiped your card at a magnetic reader and watched you key the PIN.</p>

              <p>Get a printout of your account (easier if you have internet banking) and you can trace down which particular ATM or store that the culprit used to withdraw or purchase items.. Check the surveillance camera in that place and Bob your Uncle.... you got your man(or woman).</p>

              <p><br>Since yr card is clone and u did not reveal yr number to anyone. It is the bank's security lapse. U shall not be responsible for the loss.  U can file complain and ask bank to be responsible for it.</p>

              <p>Veggie Bao, it is an ATM card. Normally used for bills payment at AXS and SAM. </p>
              <p>mlmersrlosers, 1 way to prove the card is cloned is the bank managed to retain 2 similar cards (mine and the cloned), provided the fraudster tried to withdraw $$ again after my original card was retained. </p>
              <p>As for CannyOng, I am not sure chances of getting back d $$, but will try to. :)</p>
