It is different for every people, those who are smart, of course they don't really need to study study study as you mentioned, these type of people probably has a more relaxed childhood but not necessary happy though. Those sadly to say, 'not so smart' ones will indeed have to study, probably taking up more of their playing time which might result in lesser playtime during childhood, henceforth maybe lesser funtime.<br><br>As for your part on morality, sadly, morality can only be thought within one's home since young, hardly I have seen schooling education change any person to become a better person in terms of moral.<br><br>Sadly, I never thought the education to be a marvellous system, good but definitely not to the extend of marvellous.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thanx everybody for bringing up very good points which boils down to this question...is the education system responsible for our morality??<br>if singapore wants to be a cultured and gracious society shouldn't the govt be doing something about its education to inculcate better morals into the young now?<br><br>whats the point of building a multi-million dollar opera house equipped with world class acoustics and inviting world class performers to come perform in them when you probably have a few hundred not switching of their handphones...<br>than leaving the more intiated ones to tell off the inconsiderate one which could probably lead to a fight a la the lawyer and the ns men in the cinema last year??? singapore would be a laughing stock...<br>if u are a performer i think you would rather perform in a normal theatre without people disrupting your performance than in a damn posh theatre but having morons whom let their phones ring and ring only for them to answer with a loud annoying "HULLO? IM in the middle of a peroformance LAH...dun disturb can??"<br><br>what bear said is true... it is the responsibility of the parents to educate their kids but what if their parents are incompetent...shouldn't society lend a helping hand? shouldn't this be viewed in the same way as how the judicial system takes over the responsibilty of disciplining the child when the parents fail to do so??<br><br>and how many times have we all sat through a whole hour of civics and moral education where a disinterested teacher tries to teach morals in a dull and boring way...furthermore, this same teacher is the one that cuts your queue in the canteen during recess..<br><br>i feel that moral education in school shouldn't be restricted to the classroom and a specific time slot...moral and civic education should be taught at all times esp. exemplified by teachers and staff of the school....and peiyi, teachers and parents need not follow their kids around 24/7 teaching morals but teachers, parents IN FACT EVERYBODY should be excercising good morals 24/7...and fireice, how the hell am i going to do that... im doing my bit by giving up my seat someone who needs it more than i do but how am i supposed to go around telling ppl what to do?<br><br>btw delerium...my attitudes fine its just that when i meet ppl with stupid mentality and screwed up attitudes do i have a lousy attitude get the POINT? and if u got nuthin intelligent to say than but out and dun give me no monkey crap on "this is a forum im entitled to my views" true but i would advise you to take your non-intellectual view and shove it straight up your candy ass<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>and this is about how to teach children manners and who's in charge?  everyone is, and a spoilt child is a bad reflection of first, the family, then the surroundings.<br><br>I was thinking more in the lines of "what are we lacking [in terms of intellectual content] in our educational system".<br><br>think what is most apparent is the simple lack of the "Arts".  We leave school equipped for basic skills, we all can do maths, science, English...but how many of us know about History (not just Malayan History), Music (in depth knowledge not just how to play the recorder), dance (not what you do in Zouk or Venom)...etc, etc...<br><br>We are lacking in all those things...sometimes I have this ideal that if these so-called finer things were taught, maybe basic human-kindness, humility and manners would come through as well.</div>
