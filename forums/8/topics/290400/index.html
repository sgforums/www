            <div class='col-md body'>I believe that teacher is also at fault, a good teacher will cultivate good student.<br><br>Some teachers i knew only support and pamper the good students and left the bad ones to rot, such mindset should change, in reverse, they should take care of the bad students, bring them to their best and ask the good ones to help out. The good are already good, no need much taking care of, but many teachers are blinded to it. This lead to unethical mentoring in our education system.</div>

It all starts in the home....parents giving too much leeway to their child.....child learns not to respect elders..but to demand more!! Hence, child learns that they can abuse elders...any elders...and that includes their teachers.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  It's like the child feels the world belongs to their fancy and the world owes them a living........fcuk to these kinda kids.!!<br><br>This kind of children will noe they can't get away with it.....when they go into the real world.....when they start working........using abusive words against their superiors at work will get them nowhere....just becoming a rolling stone that gathers no moss.........<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
