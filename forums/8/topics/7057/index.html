The woman(acted by Meg Ryan) didn't even get to see the guy(Tom Hanks, I think), and she was already in love wif him. Such thing always happens in the movies. But for me, haven't had the chance to meet one. Anyway, love is blind....<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, anyone heard of the urban myth involving such kind of cyber love? It goes something like this:<br><br>There was this college gal who juz broke up with her bf. She was quite upset, and wanted to do something outrageous to take her mind off the breakup, so she went online to try out cybersex.<br><br>She found this guy called Dave who said he was 23 yrs old. They chatted a little and then proceeded to have cybersex. The gal thought she quite enjoyed that. Subsequently, she logged on frequently from her college hostel room to find this Dave. After a while, the two of them progressed beyond cybersex partners to being close friends and eventually cyber lovers.<br><br>Then one day, the gal suggested they meet and the guy agreed. They planned to go to a motel under a certain assumed name so that they could find each other, whoever went there 1st. The gal got to the motel and found that she was the 1st one there, so she booked a room under the agreed name. She went into the room and waited for the guy. But she thought maybe she should undress and give the guy a surprise. So she went into the bathroom. While in the bathroom, she heard someone come in - Dave!<br><br>So she went out of the bath stark naked. She saw Dave and screamed. Dave was -- her father!<br><br>[This message has been edited by BluErf (edited 23 April 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In my opinion it all boils down to fate and luck. If you are fated to meet on the net.. den u are fated to meet lor!<br>Erm.. and it depends on wether you have the luck to be fated to meet the rite person.<br>I'm really not too sure if I would express my love for a person on-line. I belive that maybe I will crush or like the person alot.. but not love them. Love takes time to grow. I learnt it the hard way.. sighz<br>But it would be best to meet the person first. I dunnoe why, but sometimes when you meet the person, you can tell if he or she is the "right one" for you. He/she doesn't have to be yandao or chio.. its just something they have (x-factor possibly?) in them that just make it seem as if they are made for you.. once again i ask ... do i make sense?<br><br>~Peiyi<br><img src="http://www.geocities.com/channelrgs/girlkid.gif"><br><br>[This message has been edited by peiyi (edited 24 April 2000).]</div>
