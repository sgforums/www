            <div class='col-md body'>Hopes dashed as Korean hostage is killed<br><br>BAGHDAD - Iraqi militants have beheaded their South Korean hostage, Al-Jazeera television reported yesterday.<br><br>It said it had received a video tape proving that 33-year-old Kim Sun Il had been executed.<br><br>Al-Jazeera said the execution was carried out by an Al-Qaeda-linked group that calls itself Monotheism and Jihad.<br><br>The group had threatened to execute Mr Kim, a translator for a South Korean company in Iraq, by Monday night if Seoul did not pull out its troops from the country and scrap a recent decision to send more. Their demands were rejected.<br><br>Hopes were raised earlier yesterday that Mr Kim would be spared following reports from mediators that his captors had decided to give more time for talks on his fate.<br><br>They were also reported to have dropped their demand that Seoul pull its troops out of Iraq and not send more.<br><br>But no deadline was set to replace the one that lapsed on Monday night.<br><br>Amid the uncertainty, the South Korean government said it would evacuate all remaining civilians in Iraq.<br><br>Iraqi mediator Mohammed al-Obedi said yesterday: 'The kidnappers have said they are willing to negotiate as long as the South Korean government stops making provocative remarks and softens its tone on troop deployment.'<br><br>Mr Obedi, who works for the South Korean security firm NKTS in Baghdad, said Iraqi clerics were in talks with the militants.<br><br>Mr Choi Seung Gap, president of NKTS, said the abductors had made other demands that were acceptable. 'It is highly likely we will see a resolution,' he added.<br><br>Mr Kim was shown pleading for his life in a video sent to Arabic satellite channels on Sunday night.<br><br>His captors have identified themselves as members of a group led by Al-Qaeda operative Abu Mussab al-Zarqawi.<br><br>A South Korean MP, Mr Kim Sung Gon of the ruling Uri Party, told reporters yesterday that the clerics found the captive alive and well.<br><br>'To my understanding, the Iraqi religious leaders are trying to persuade the captors to release Kim by letting them know that South Korea's troop dispatch to Iraq is aimed at helping reconstruction work and not to attack it,' he told Yonhap news agency.<br><br>As negotiations got under way, Korean authorities said moves to evacuate the remaining 22 businessmen still in Iraq will be completed by early next month.<br><br>Mr Kim, who worked for a private contractor, had planned to return home next month. His sister, Ms Jung Sook, 34, described him as a devout Christian who had degrees in Arabic, English and theology and hoped to become a missionary in the Middle East.<br><br>-- Reuters, AP,Los Angeles Times,Washington Post</div>

Becoz i believe no religion would teach ppl to do something bad, like killing. But do u know these terrorist always quote verses from quran. Are thier version of quran different from those used in asia? They really use the verses from quran to gain support of thier act. The question is y are they still seen as non muslim terrorist for they use the quran to back them up. For eg, Koran 5:51, Koran 9:29, Koran 2:191, Koran 9:5, Koran 9:123. Unless thier quran is a different version. I am just asking for the sake of knowledge..not arguing. As i had mention, i had done quite a number of readings about this issue..and i just wan to find out the truth, not arguement nor disagreement. Pls enlighten me for i do not wish to percieve a wrong idea.  Thx<br><br>For those who do not read the content of quran, or trying to find out more ...pls do NOT  giv ur own judgement. No war pls.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
