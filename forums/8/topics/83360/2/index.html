            <div class='col-md body'>for me, what i see is that most religions are grown in religion, whether buddhist, or muslim or wat. children are brought up to do certain rituals from young, without knowing its purpose. they just do it, because they are told to.<br><br>but for me, christianity is a choice. i chose to follow it, because of my own personal experience with God. and my own reading up about it. finding facts and stuff.<br><br>anyway, that aside. muslims believe in violence la. whether its in defense, or watever, violence is violence, it doesn't matter if they are provoked into it, or they are the provoker.  they just don't understand that.<br><br>whereas christianity, Jesus speaks of turning the other cheek, forgiveness. and service. and love.<br><br>every preacher of Christ's love, never shown signs of aggression as revenge or watever. usually, they died, murdered for their faith. different from muslims version of dying for their faith, which is borned of violence.<br><br>look at the apostles, peter, paul and all that. they were all executed in history for their faith. and you compare that with muslims' terrorism, violence. and their excuse is that they were provoked, and they are defending themselves and their believes.</div>

But can u help me to do these readings "Koran 5:51, Koran 9:29, Koran 2:191, Koran 9:5, Koran 9:123. ". Could u tell me what ur quran say about these verses.? As I had stated in my previous post, i ask for the sake of knowing. Crusader are extremely wrong, for in the bible , there are no teaching about killing is right. Killing will never be tolerate in Christianity no matter wat. But as u said...i do believe there is one bunch of jokers around to defame thier own religion. Well, if u could kindly tell me what ur quran say about those verses i would be very glad to hear. I will not make any personal judgment or attack, for this is not my aim. I just wan to know what is it that they wrote only, nothing wrong about it right?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  thx<br><br>[/b]</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, i would like to say i'm not an Islamic scholar or anything and can't read arabic.<br><br>As for the translation, i got it from http://cwis.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/<br><br>Anyways,<br>002.191<br>And slay them wherever ye catch them, and turn them out from where they have Turned you out; for<strong> tumult and oppression are worse than slaughter</strong>; but fight them not at the Sacred Mosque, unless they (first) fight you there; but if they fight you, slay them. Such is the reward of those who suppress faith.<br><br>Take note the word oppression. Yes it does say that... However, right before that.....<br><br>002.190<br>Fight in the cause of Allah(SWT) <strong>those who fight you, but do not transgress limits</strong>; for Allah(SWT) loveth not transgressors.<br><br>005.051<br>O ye who believe! take not the Jews and the Christians for your friends and protectors: They are but friends and protectors to each other. And he amongst you that turns to them (for friendship) is of them. Verily Allah guideth not a people unjust.<br><br>Yes it does say that to but.....<br><br>005.082<br>Strongest among men in enmity to the believers wilt thou find the Jews and Pagans; and nearest among them in love to the believers wilt thou find those who say, "We are Christians": because amongst these are men devoted to learning and men who have renounced the world, and they are not arrogant.<br><br><strong>So basically, you can't just lift verses directly and try to understand them. You have to read the whole thing. Also, these are direct translations and much of the meaning has been lost. Ppl usually study for many many years before they can really understand the meaning behind the words. Which is why there are many many books writen by scholars to explain the meanings and these books are usually very thick. Lastly, i would like to remind u i'm not a scholar. If you are really interested, you should ask someone more qualified  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </strong><br><br></div>

But i just never thought of y we cant lift up the verses like that, becoz chrisians normally just " lift" up the verses from the bible to preach ..any verses are fine....Now maybe from ur statement, i began to realize that to understand the quran, it requires a different method, which is not just lifting up verses.

And moreover we're the only Muslim in the family.<br><br>As far as i've known, my religion doen not teach or tell people to kill others.<br>If they related to the term of Jihad, You die in Jihad if you fight in the name of Allah. Of course if ur country is on war, you have to fight people who fight you. In that case, I can say that people who kill in order to defeat his country is Jihad.<br>And Jihad is not only about killing people, fighting people, and all the cruel things. As far as i've known, if u teach others ur knowledge (a good one of cos), u help other in needs, that's also Jihad.<br><br>But this terrorist kill for wad ? For their own sake. That's not Jihad.<br>They really defame the religion. And i doubt if they're really Muslims ??? They live in Muslim countries, yes. But are they one ?<br><br>And yes, you cannot just quote something fm Al-Quran and make excuses from it. You have to read them thru, because they all related to one another. And it's not an easy task to read all thru. And eventhough u've read all, also doesn't mean u understand all it contents. Very complicated, huh ? Yeah..i admit. Even me should learn more now. Thanks for the reference. I'd ask someone who's eligible to explain to me about the matter.<br><br>As for the korean guy, i agree with tare. They din kill him bcos he's a Christian (and how do u know if this Korean guy is a Christian / not ?). That's in order to threaten the S. Korean to prevent them to send 3,000 troops into Iraq.<br><br>I also hope they'll vanish all terrorist in the world to its roots.<br><br>Btw...have u guys ever think that terrorist is actually only after US ? (well..that's my thought)<br>What's the relation between US and terrorist ? Anyone has an idea ?<br>And this time..leave the religion. Dun mix that US = Christians and terrorist = Muslim.<br><br>Cheers and Peace !<br><br></div>
