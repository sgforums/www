              <p>I would like to take this opportunity to expose the various loopholes found in corporate insurance all along and hopefully bring about some awareness in the general public.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Loophole number 1</span></strong></p>
              <p>If you are a staff in an established local company or MNCs, most likely you, your spouse and dependants (kids) are covered by your company insurance. This means that employees are entitled up to $1,600(just an example, actual coverage might varies) in their outpatient medical claims per policy year, which includes GP, Specialists visit etc.</p>
              <p>The loopholes is that if you and your spouse are working in different MNCs, both of you can claim for each other or your kids at the same time! Especially true if the insurance company is different. Simply submit a claim on your side and after a month, call up the clinic again and informed them that you have visit them last month and are now trying to make a claim but you have lost the original receipt, they will give you one "original" receipt in no time and let your husband claim this time! The extra reimbursements will be your performance bonus for the month! LOL</p>
              <p>It's a common sight to have specialist consultation incurred up to a few hundreds per visit, so it's really not an insignificant amount that people cheat. I've seen people who manage to use up all their entitlements every year!  I'm really disgusted to see people who are taking advantage of this channel, especially since they're earning quite a lot themselves monthly.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Loophole number 2</span></strong></p>
              <p>Before we go into number 2, let me tell you how insurance works, it is a business, and a business is to make money.</p>
              <p>It take into accounts of the chances that you might be down with cancer or illness etc, and only those illness or stage of disease that less than 50% of the total amount of buyer will be infected will be claimable. In other words, for every 10 people who buy the insurance, only less than 5(or maybe less than 3) will down with cancer. People buy because everyone scared that they might be the unlucky 3 fellows.</p>
              <p>It's not a problem though. I'm just highlighting this fact to let people know that this is the reason why medical screening/checkup is never being covered, since they're all carried out "voluntarily" by people.</p>
              <p>The loopholes appear when people go to a GP for a medical checkup,such as blood test, urine test etc, and go claim as a GP claim! The receipt will not show if you're visiting the doctor because you're sick or if you're going for a checkup. If it shows too much information, simply change to another clinic! This is a reason why people are able to claim something which they are not allow to. If every employees use this method and hit their maximum entitlements every year, the insurance company will fail, as it is suppose to ensure that only less than 50% of the total supposed coverage/entitlements figure is paid to employees in reality.</p>
              <p>It is not hard to see that you can actually use both loopholes together, do a medical checkup at some clinic, and claim both side. Bingo! Money comes! Or just see a specialist for some minor problem, and bingo! money comes!</p>
              <p>More to come when i have the mood to type....</p>
