What is a medical board review?????</div></blockquote>Medical Board..is to review the condition of your surgery.. and it is most likely to make you go back to your unit at a earlier date..which means to reduce your medical leave.<br>Regarding your deferment..there is no way that they can force you to defer if you are injured due to training..you have not mentioned how were you injure...during training?<br>As as you have already said..he is a retired major..so there is really very limited things that he is really able to do..and that to defer someone due to such cases is really a very tedious case which i doubt that they will perform.<br>Do not worry too much abt that...just remember not to sign any documents with regards to defrement issues and they will not be able to do anything to you..dun really know much detials abt your case.. but toking to your immidiate superiors abt it and highlighting to them your concerns might help..gd luck</div>
