            <div class='col-md body'>I'm a full-time NS personnel and got enlisted on the Voluntary Early Enlistment Scheme.  I have an injury that happened before being enlisted, thus resulting in a few months of Hospitalisation Leave from surgeries in my 10 months of National Service.  A few Officers aren't happy with me and initially wanted to extend my ORD according to how much Hospitalisation Leave I've taken.  Now they want to defer me till August!  Is there anyone here that can advise or comment on this issue?  Thanks.</div>

I don't think they can charge me for malingering because it's surgury we're talking about.  But can you please also advise on the deferment issue?  The reason why I volunteered to be enlisted earlier is to study overseas after NS.  Now that they want to defer me till August this year, I'm really upset.  It eliminates my purpose of early enlistment!<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From what I know (I've a relative in the army), they have a right to hold you back if they can account for it e.g. if they say that your job has not been done well during your period of service and you are responsible for certain serious matters, etc. But I think this applies only if the matter is of great importance or might affect the security of Singapore or result in some big undesirable consequences.<br><br>However, if they want to extend your service because of your mc, I think it's not likely that they will succeed because when you were enlisted, you were supposed to be certified by the MO (at CMPB) that you were fit to enter the army.  So, logically, any medical leave you take during your NS days should not be an reason to extend your service.</div>

I'm wondering what to say to my superior so as to change his mind to defer me...<br></div>

Surely that is sufficient reason for extended durations of leave during NS?<br><br>There is only one reason why so many officers would want to make ur life so difficult. Forgive my impertinence but i suspect that u may have been a trouble-maker in NS. U've likely ducked and covered way too often to the extent that many label u as "chao keng".<br><br>If that is truly the case, then u shd reflect on wat u have done, not how to avoid these actions against u. These things r aready out of ur hands.<br><br>No officer in NS would wanna penalise u if u've performed ur duties without problems, even if u've had long term surgical leave on NS expence. But if u've been neglecting ur vocation often, then i can understand why they wanna chalk up 101 reasons to keep u ard.<br><br>Gd luck.</div>
