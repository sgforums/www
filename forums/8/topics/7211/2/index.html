Why bother so much about how other look at you?</div></blockquote>Yeah, we don't have to bother about how other people look at us. But if you want to leave a lasting first impression on people, your outer appearances like dressing style, posture etc do matter, don't you think so? This sounds shallow but it is a hard cold fact. This good first impression should provide with you some opportunities to meet gals at social functions. After the first impression has been made, then other factors like confidence and speech will come into play as stated by Manhunt. Thus, if you want gals to take notice of you at a party, gathering or when you are shopping, put in some effort into dressing nice. It works. BTW, I don't think a collar shirt over a plain T is unbearable in Singapore's weather. Come on, we are in air-conditioned place most of the time! If it really gets too hot, just unbutton the collar shirt all the way or just take it off.<br><br>In case I sound too superficial, I would like to add that dressing nice will only get you this far. I still believe that factors like good character, romantic, humor are the way to go if you want to get your dream girl. Outer appearance is just a complimentary factor.<br><br><blockquote><strong>And by the way, since the topic started from "Only pretty gals gets attached?" ended up to "Guys dressing".

If I were to attend some special function, regardless whether I like the shirt or not, I will still wear it. Simply because wear according to function require or like what you said leave a good impression. Therefore there is no need for us to discuss what should we wear for function. Or one good example, you are invited to go chalet, most likely you will get to know a lot of friends there, don't forget that going chalet most people would wear as simple as possible, don't tell me you dress up to go chalet just to leave good impression for those people you going to meet? I always believe in dress according to situation require.<br><br>Since you don't get my point well, I stress my point one more time. There is no need to dress up when going to Orchard or town central for jalan jalan or have my dinner just for people to think I am being fancy or interesting. I believe behaving what myself is.<br><br>Maybe you didn't get manhunt point well, he is trying to say that if a person is very well dressed, however the moment he opens his mouth, all those !@#$%^&amp;* came out. So whats the point. I believe not everybody goes for a person looks. All depend on a person character. 1st impression is important, however it is the person character that play an important part in long run and not the dressing that count in a long run.<br><br>You could be the type who don't sweat much, but not everybody is like you. Some people sweat very easily even when only wearing a T-shirt walking on the street they can sweat a lot. You still expect them to wear a shirt over it? If you were to take out the shirt if weather is hot (as you mention), than what is the difference from just wearing a T-shirt with a jeans which is sloppy as you mention previously. If you were to unbutton the collar shirt (as you mention), I think you would leave a worst impression compare to just T-shirt and jeans.<br><br>As for your last point, ok you are just being polite, that is a mistake in my part. No offence ok?<br><br>[This message has been edited by millennium (edited 09 May 2000).]</div>
