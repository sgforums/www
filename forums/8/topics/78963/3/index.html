            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Ironically, Scripture says just the opposite. 1 Corinthians 1 - 21For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe ... 27But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong. 28He chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things -- and the things that are not -- to nullify the things that are, 29so that no one may boast before him. </blockquote>A correction... from the official american standard and king james version, 1:29is "that no flesh should glory before God"<br><br>http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/1corinthians-asv.html<br><br>If u ask me, from corinthians 1-21, some christians say tat preaching was foolish. And god was happy about it since common knowledge point to the direction tat god doesn't exists. He was happy tat people keep being foolish so tat they can believe in him. Is this interpretation wrong ?<br><br>And wat is the justifications ? IMO relatively poor... the reasons why he do tat is because he just want to be the most glorious person, the most proudest person, the only one tat can boast around.<br><br>If u like such a being tat want to be boastful by opressing people to remains foolish, then so be it.<br><br>BTW before I answer your million dollar question, why don't u tell me whether u r considered foolish or wise first ?<br><br>ANyway thanks for coming up with ridiculously grammatical error prone long sentence from the bible to confuse the people. I don't think just coming out with "cheem" passage to confuse people is "clever" or "witty". My impression is u r trying to smoke only.<br><br><blockquote>Yours is a fallacy of false dilemma. Easily countered by the life and works of people who started science in the first place, ie. Copernicus, Galileo and Newton. </blockquote>Why don't u refrain from using silly terms and tell me wat is the significance of using the name of Copernicus, Galileo and Newton ?<br><br><blockquote>This is rubbish. He doesn't have the onus to prove God exists even if you can prove science exists, since the two are not mutually exclusive. The onus is on you, SIS. </blockquote>No no no... it is always the case of the person to prove a being exist and not for others to prove it doesn't. As said before about the UFO, I claim I saw it in orchard rd. It will be easier and relatively conventional tat I prove my claims instead of other people looking for evidence tat proves otherwise. Since u guys claim tat something as ridiculous as god exists, then the onus of proving it lies on u. If u insist tat the dis-proving has to be done instead of proving it, then please try to counter tis claim I have<br><br>"G-- look like a purple hippo with fat ass and fart all day long. He is brainless and like to deceive people and sad to say  many people believe in it"<br><br>Now try to prove me wrong. Come out with proof to say I am wrong lah ! If no one can proves me wrong, then I am correct ?<br><br>SO I should prove to u tat god doesn't exists or u guys who claim he did prove to me he do ?<br><br><blockquote>If you want to argue, at least get your argument right.<br><br>People go hell not 'cos they don't believe in God, but rather by their own sins. </blockquote>Then let me ask, when u r a baby and just born to tis world, have u sinned ? In christian context , amazingly they do (from your favourite christian sources <a href="http://christiananswers.net/q-eden/edn-f006.html" rel="nofollow">http://christiananswers.net/q-eden/edn-f006.html</a>). Tat is why they claims tat only believers of christ r washed from their sins. Even if u r a baby or watsoever it is just too bad. Since everyone sin when they r borned, then wat is the point of classifying people into sinner and non sinners?<br><br><blockquote>What kind of God is this - for He so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son for us? Ask yourself in your heart ... what kind of God is this? </blockquote>Wat kind of god is tis ? He kill and torture his son to convince himself to forgive men. He do not sacrifice his son to the enemies or to nature, he sacrifice it to himself ! Take note of the words, he SACRIFICE HIS SON TO HIMSELF ! Ask yourself in your heart wat kind of sadist do tis ?<br><br><blockquote>People like SIS are just too stunned by God's love for us. Simply too stunned ... until he feels sorry for the Son and questions why the Father has to sacrifice the Son</blockquote>I am stunned about why people r foolish into believer stories tat doesn't speak head or tails and everything the bible claims must be correct and everythign else is wrong... doesn't the story of jesus christs sounds silly ?<br><br><blockquote>since do not believe that God exists and ask the christians to prove it. then i ask on their behalf that they do not believe God does not exist, please prove it. </blockquote>Sorry boy, u believe in the existence of god. So u prove it. Someone in another place may believe in the existence of a purple hippo god, should he prove it to everyone or everyone else have to work and prove it does not exists ?<br><br><blockquote>and if you prove that God doesn't exist, then the 'evil acts' that you quoted does not stand. something that doesn't exist cannot commit such an act even if He has reasons to do so. it's like you heard that the Loch Ness monster is a human-eating creature and you embark on a mission to condemn the monster. but the fact is that you do not know whether the Loch Ness monster exists or not.</blockquote>If u believe in loch ness monster, then u have to prove it to be true to everyone else. Not the rest of the world trying to prove it do not exists.<br><br>And without proving whether god exist or not, I still can say tat the evil acts exists to prove tat the god christian believe is still "seriously flawed". Lets say some scientists say gravity doesn't exists. Do I have to fully believe him <strong>FIRST</strong> in order to criticise his ridiculous ideas ? Lets say someone believe in a purple hippo god, do u <strong>have to believe </strong>in the existence of this purple god before u can comment on it ? No ! I don't believe in it, and I just tell him why I don't believe in his ideas. DO not try to twist psychology or words towards me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>what Stupidissmart said is very very logical, and until someone can prove that GOD exist, no one can say that it does...<br><br>wat really puzzles me is how religions like christianity don't condemn violence but instead uses violence to promote it... Maybe that's the reason why the stupid Americans are going to war with everyone who opposes them...<br><br>I can't think of the last time a country like Thailand which can be classified as a Buddhist country, resort to violence in any political situation or any other situation... i think it is due to the fact that Buddhism condemns violence...<br><br>Another thing that puzzles me is that in Christianity, people who don't believe in GOD will go to hell, does it mean that If my you killed 10 children and believed in GOD, you still won't go to hell. Whereas if i saved 10 children and didn't believe in GOD, I would go to hell? Err... is there something seriously wrong with the rules?<br><br>Take a look at Buddhism, which has a totally opposite WAY OF LIFE to that of Christianity. In buddhism, there is such a thing called "KARMA", which can be roughly translated to as: "What one gets for his/her deeds during life" Example would be: if you killed 10 children and believed in Buddha, you will still go to hell due to your BAD KARMA. Whereas if i saved 10 children and didn't believe in Buddha, I will not go to hell becos I have GOOD KARMA and buddha recognises that even though i don't believe in Budhha.<br><br>I'm not trying to say which religion is better, i'm just trying to state the obvious difference between the two different religious WAY OF LIFE.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

If you know history, the [Catholic] Church and State last time did used violence to promote the religion. Hmmm, not promote, they literally shove up people's arse. Choose conversion or death.<br><br><strong>Maybe that's the reason why the stupid Americans are going to war with everyone who opposes them...  </strong><br><br>The reason is political rather than religious?

The pig is the reincarnation of a baddie. So the butcher is commiting evil (accumulating bad karma) or the instrument of fate? Ok, maybe this reason not good enough, since the job of butcher is to slaughter pigs .. haha .. but you can find similar scenarios.<br><br><strong>buddha recognises that even though i don't believe in Budhha.</strong><br><br>I don't think Buddha is some transcendental non-corporeal mind somewhere right?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>I see.  Okay, traditionally in proving something, if you have a hypothesis of anything, say any scientific crap like e=mc^2, etc.. you empirically prove it first, then if someone else wants to dissolve this theory, they have to offer a better alternative which also must be proven. </blockquote>U want prove ? Ever heard of the big bang theory ? Wat other question do u have ?<br><br><blockquote>Now it seems like both sides want each other to prove whatever they said beforehand. The thing is, when you want to offer a claim of something, you have to empirically prove it first, the person who defies that something need to point out the errors AND provide an alternative something else. </blockquote>I have stated my alternative and they do have some proving and mathematically derived. SO now it is your call.<br><br><blockquote>If the world is not made by God, who, what, why, when made it? Yada..yada..yada.. This is the minimal.<br><br>Meanwhile, the chguy should also give examples of Godly acts that can relate to a non-believer, or more practical ways of proving the existence of God. I know He exist because He does, does not make any difference to the rest of us even if it is true. There is no point preaching to the non-believer when all you know is how to communicate and share with believers.</blockquote>Why don't u give the examples yourself ? Wat godly act r there available ? Do these godly acts occur for other religions ?<br><br><blockquote>You know this will never end until either the world comes to an end. Or your life comes to an end. Then you'll know the truth, but you know that by then you'd have either wasted your not knowing the truth or reap the rewards of your beliefs. </blockquote>So wat is the best thing to do now ? Explore both options fully to know the truth. Tat is the most important thing. Why do u want to put it as though it should be a gamble and not doing some research of your own ?<br><br><blockquote>As for proving God's existence, for the non-religious, you should disprove His existence. For that's the basic criteria to your argument, if He doesn't exist, then there's no argument. If He doesn't exist, then the Bible is not the truth and nothing from it should be quoted to discredit God. And this is so because you've proven He does not exist. </blockquote>Tat is again a repetative of wat u r trying to say all along. WHy do I need to do it when u can't even prove to us god exists ? How to dis-prove somethign tat doesn't exists or where u doesn't give any evidence of its existence ? Why can't u prove ? Is it because it doesn't exists ? Tat is the only reason why it cannot be proved isn't it ? If it is true, then show it to us ! EVeryone will be convinced of it and convert to christainity isn't it ? If the evidence is overwhleming, heck, I may even be a believer myself ! I thought some christain always encourage people to believe in christainity ? Isn't tis an excellent opportunity ? Face it man ! All these theological crap just highlight to everyone tat THERE IS NO EVIDENCE POINTING TOWARD THE EXISTENCE OF GOD, aka THERE IS NO GOD<br><br>Another thing is, if God exist, then why does he have to hid as such ? Why does he have to make life after death a secret ? WHy don't he appear once in a while to lead people to the right direction ? U state tat u havbe to believe in it first before u know the "wonders" of god. Why shouldn't he show us the "wonders" now so we know tat we should act as such. Doesn't all these point to the fact tat it doesn't exists ? Is it some fairy tales made by some people centuries ago ?<br><br><blockquote>For the religious, they do not need to prove His existence because their belief is on the basis of faith. Because they belief in His existence, so they don't see a need to prove it. They made a choice to believe it. They believe in a god that is infallible so it's really no use trying to disprove it. </blockquote>Talking about blind faith, don't u realise tat it is illogical ? No proving needed ? Then why don't u believe in the buddhist or hinduism or muslim ? Faith doesn't tell u wat is right or wrong, truth or lies isn't it ? Isn't tat the same as children believing in Santa Claus or Tooth fairies ? Wat is the difference between these children and u ? Why do u believe in a god tat gives u the brain for reasoning and do not let u use it ? It is like the emperror new clothes. All the people have faith on wat the tailor had said was true, tat is only smart people can see the clothes on it. They never question tis fact at all. Only the kid tat apply "seeing is believing" saw the truth tat the emperor is naked.<br><br><blockquote>Like I said, issues like this never goes anywhere. Believing in something or not believing in something is a personal choice.</blockquote>Since u believe in it, then u surely can answer the many question I have asked isn't it ? Why can't u answer the doubtful point on the bible ?<br><br><blockquote>Sure sure. No wonder Thailand is fittingly labelled "The Land of the Free". They too peaceful liao. That's why when the Japs invaded SEA .. the government chose to co-operate rather than resist like the British and Dutch. Hahahah ... </blockquote>So u expect thailand to fight in a war tat they will surely lose ? U want to country to fight and result in the lost of many lives ?<br><br><blockquote>Anyway you're wrong to say they don't resort to violence in "any other situation". You read the papers? Clash between militants and the government. </blockquote>I think it is good to realise tat the militants are not buddhists. SO when militants attacked the civilians, u want thailand to remain "The Land of the Free" and let they do watever the militant want ? SOund a bit contradictory between the first and second paragraph...<br><br><blockquote>I think you're making it very simplistic. For one, how do you know someone believe in God? How do you know he/she is saved or not saved? </blockquote>The one making things simple r all the poster and banners fixed outside churches writing. Isn't tis view the view of common christians ?<br><br><blockquote>Read the parable of the ten virgins. You don't understand ask Neon to explain to you.  And it is written in Matthew 22, "For many are invited, but few are chosen." </blockquote>U can come out with tis single line but throughout the bible there r tons of material tat suggest just believing in christ will entitles u to heaven.<br><br>"They, like all humanity, can be saved only through Christ. "<br><br>from your favourtie website again<br><br><a href="http://christiananswers.net/q-eden/edn-f006.html" rel="nofollow">http://christiananswers.net/q-eden/edn-f006.html</a> <strong>num 2</strong><br><br>Such is called "bible contradictions".<br><br>In the past I thought u say it is gift ?
