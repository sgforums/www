            <div class='col-md body'>I'm Christian and I can say I follow "God"...but to be fair to people of other beliefs, the real question is which God/Goddess/god/gods/goddesses and what denomination/religion/creed/faith/sect/belief.....<br><br>And which "Satan" are u talking about.  "Satan" means "one who opposes"...and even in the old Christian tradition (from ancient apochryphal texts), there are many demons and fallen angels of which Lucifer is but one amongst many (Moloch, Astaroth,Beelzebub, Lilith, Asmodeus, Belial, Azazel, etc, etc) in the Legion of Hell....and in other religions, the distinction between good and evil are not clearly defined, with some demons being recognised as possessing godhood (eg. Ravana) too.....<br><br>And moreover, in the past, many deities of other faiths (which were gods to their believers) were demonised and as a consequence purged (e.g Mithra) by the Christian church.</div>

Nathan u better be careful u know. God is one of the most cruel thing ever existed in the face of mankind. Below r listed the cruelty of God from the bible itself<br><br>Instances of cruel and unjust behavior by the God of the Bible are seen in even the most basic teachings of the Christian religion. Some well-known acts of the biblical God that are in fact immoral because they resulted in the suffering of the innocent include the following: he damned the whole human race and cursed the entire creation because of the acts of two people (Genesis 3:16-23; Romans 5:1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">; he drowned pregnant women and innocent children and animals at the time of the Flood (Genesis 7:20-23); he tormented the Egyptians and their animals with hail and disease because pharaoh refused to let the Israelites leave Egypt (Exodus 9:8-11,25); he killed Egyptian babies at the time of the Passover (Exodus 12:29-30); subsequent to the Exodus he ordered the Israelites to annihilate the men, women, and children of seven nations and to steal their land (Deuteronomy 7:1-2); he killed King David's baby because of David's adultery with Bathsheba (II Samuel 12:13-1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">; he required the torture and murder of his own son (e.g., Romans 3:24-25); and he promised to send to eternal torture those persons who do not accept Christianity (e.g., Revelation 21:<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">.<br><br>The God of the Bible also displays his sadistic tendencies by employing a variety of other methods to torment the innocent. He opens the earth so that it swallows entire families (Numbers 16:27-32); he causes fire to devour people (e.g., Leviticus 10:1-2; Numbers 11:1-2); he sends wild animals such as bears (II Kings 2:23-24), lions (II Kings 17:24-25), and serpents (Numbers 21:6) upon people; he sanctions slavery (e.g., Leviticus 25:44-46); he orders religious persecution (e.g., Deuteronomy 13:12-16); he causes cannibalism (Jeremiah 19:9); and he requires the killing of animals as expiation for the sins of their owners (e.g., Exodus 29:36).<br><br>In addition to causing the innocent to suffer, another type of cruelty that the biblical God is guilty of is the infliction of punishments that are grossly disproportionate to the acts for which those punishments were administered<br><br>In the Old Testament, the Lord prescribes execution as punishment for the "crimes" of working on the sabbath (Exodus 31:15); cursing one's parents (Leviticus 20:9); worshiping other gods (Deuteronomy 17:2-5); enticing a friend or family member to worship other gods (Deuteronomy 13:6-10); being a witch, medium, or wizard (Exodus 22:18, Leviticus 20:27); engaging in homosexual acts (Leviticus 20:13); and not being a virgin on one's wedding night (Deuteronomy 22:20-21). Certainly, to require the death penalty for such acts is to completely reject the notion that the severity of a punishment should bear some proportion to the seriousness of the offense.<br><br>from<br><br>http://members.aol.com/bbu84/biblicalstupidity/why.htm#9<br><br>so nathan better be careful u know.... but thankfully u do not worship in such a ridiculous thing so the cruelty of god doesn't really apply to u  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
