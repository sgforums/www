            <div class='col-md body'>Well, to begin, I am new to forums in general. I'll try to avoid the cross fire, pardon my ignorance on some religous doctorine if I do get them wrong.<br><br>First, I would like to point out the misunderstanding about the karmaric nature in Buddhist phy. It is too simplistic to assume the cause and effect arguments. Also, there are no "fate" involved here since the inpermanace argument also applies.<br><br>Analogy: E=MC^2 is the most popular and well known equation and it is also wrong. It should be E0=M0C^2. The full equation is E^2=(PC)^2 + (MC^2)^2.  The energy-mass relation in special relativity. e=mc^2 is just the rest mass energy.<br><br>Second, I would like to say that in Buddhist phy, Gods do exist but not as the Almighty, the creator, etc.. But as a being in a different realms of existance and is also subjected to Karma. There are a number of realms of existence plus a number of other worlds in existence. Taoist had a different phy. But Taoist also belived in the creation from nothingness, not a God , a sole creator of all things.<br><br>Third, it's just Faiths we are talking about. It's either you believe or you don't. I do not believed in the existence of an a creator, thus my rejection of the Christain Faith, no hard feelings there. Bottle up all your emoions and stop critising all other Faiths. I'm not a Buddhist y the way. I believed in Physics. Period.<br><br>Please don't reply if after reading my post, makes you says fouls things because you've got to cool it first.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Icemoon:<br><strong><br><br>Which preacher or evangelist use violence to promote christianity?<br><br>But you have a point. If you know history, the [Catholic] Church and State last time did used violence to promote the religion. Hmmm, not promote, they literally shove up people's arse. Choose conversion or death.<br><br>[b]Maybe that's the reason why the stupid Americans are going to war with everyone who opposes them...  </strong><br><br>The reason is political rather than religious? If you think US wanted the oil fields in Iraq, that's greed and not love for Christ right?<br><br><strong>I can't think of the last time a country like Thailand which can be classified as a Buddhist country, resort to violence in any political situation or any other situation... i think it is due to the fact that Buddhism condemns violence... </strong><br><br>Sure sure. No wonder Thailand is fittingly labelled "The Land of the Free". They too peaceful liao. That's why when the Japs invaded SEA .. the government chose to co-operate rather than resist like the British and Dutch. Hahahah ...<br><br>Anyway you're wrong to say they don't resort to violence in "any other situation". You read the papers? Clash between militants and the government.<br><br><strong>Another thing that puzzles me is that in Christianity, people who don't believe in GOD will go to hell, does it mean that If my you killed 10 children and believed in GOD, you still won't go to hell.</strong><br><br>I think you're making it very simplistic. For one, how do you know someone believe in God? How do you know he/she is saved or not saved?<br><br>Read the parable of the ten virgins. You don't understand ask Neon to explain to you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> And it is written in Matthew 22, "For many are invited, but few are chosen."<br><br><strong>Whereas if i saved 10 children and didn't believe in GOD, I would go to hell? Err... is there something seriously wrong with the rules?</strong><br><br>You got the rules wrong. The rule is, you're punished of your own sins. Ok, this is another can of worms. SIS will protest like hell .. haha<br><br><strong>Take a look at Buddhism, which has a totally opposite WAY OF LIFE to that of Christianity. In buddhism, there is such a thing called "KARMA</strong><br><br>Karma also has problems. For example, how do you deal with the butcher who has to slaughter the pig? The pig is the reincarnation of a baddie. So the butcher is commiting evil (accumulating bad karma) or the instrument of fate? Ok, maybe this reason not good enough, since the job of butcher is to slaughter pigs .. haha .. but you can find similar scenarios.<br><br><strong>buddha recognises that even though i don't believe in Budhha.</strong><br><br>I don't think Buddha is some transcendental non-corporeal mind somewhere right?[/b]</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Each people have their own way of thinking and way of choice to decide. In bible, it say God create the heaven and earth, also create human in his own imagination and for the buddism, they believe human was form after monkey. People also believe that Earth was create because of Mother Nature, believe whatever your mind tells you to believe.
