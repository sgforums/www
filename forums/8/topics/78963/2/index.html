God is one of the most cruel thing ever existed in the face of mankind. Below r listed the cruelty of God from the bible itself<br><br>Instances of cruel and unjust behavior by the God of the Bible are seen in even the most basic teachings of the Christian religion. Some well-known acts of the biblical God that are in fact immoral because they resulted in the suffering of the innocent include the following: he damned the whole human race and cursed the entire creation because of the acts of two people (Genesis 3:16-23; Romans 5:1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">; he drowned pregnant women and innocent children and animals at the time of the Flood (Genesis 7:20-23); he tormented the Egyptians and their animals with hail and disease because pharaoh refused to let the Israelites leave Egypt (Exodus 9:8-11,25); he killed Egyptian babies at the time of the Passover (Exodus 12:29-30); subsequent to the Exodus he ordered the Israelites to annihilate the men, women, and children of seven nations and to steal their land (Deuteronomy 7:1-2); he killed King David's baby because of David's adultery with Bathsheba (II Samuel 12:13-1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">; he required the torture and murder of his own son (e.g., Romans 3:24-25); and he promised to send to eternal torture those persons who do not accept Christianity (e.g., Revelation 21:<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">.<br><br>The God of the Bible also displays his sadistic tendencies by employing a variety of other methods to torment the innocent. He opens the earth so that it swallows entire families (Numbers 16:27-32); he causes fire to devour people (e.g., Leviticus 10:1-2; Numbers 11:1-2); he sends wild animals such as bears (II Kings 2:23-24), lions (II Kings 17:24-25), and serpents (Numbers 21:6) upon people; he sanctions slavery (e.g., Leviticus 25:44-46); he orders religious persecution (e.g., Deuteronomy 13:12-16); he causes cannibalism (Jeremiah 19:9); and he requires the killing of animals as expiation for the sins of their owners (e.g., Exodus 29:36).<br><br>In addition to causing the innocent to suffer, another type of cruelty that the biblical God is guilty of is the infliction of punishments that are grossly disproportionate to the acts for which those punishments were administered<br><br>In the Old Testament, the Lord prescribes execution as punishment for the "crimes" of working on the sabbath (Exodus 31:15); cursing one's parents (Leviticus 20:9); worshiping other gods (Deuteronomy 17:2-5); enticing a friend or family member to worship other gods (Deuteronomy 13:6-10); being a witch, medium, or wizard (Exodus 22:18, Leviticus 20:27); engaging in homosexual acts (Leviticus 20:13); and not being a virgin on one's wedding night (Deuteronomy 22:20-21). Certainly, to require the death penalty for such acts is to completely reject the notion that the severity of a punishment should bear some proportion to the seriousness of the offense.<br><br>from<br><br>http://members.aol.com/bbu84/biblicalstupidity/why.htm#9<br><br>so nathan better be careful u know.... but thankfully u do not worship in such a ridiculous thing so the cruelty of god doesn't really apply to u  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>i wonder why people prefer to read one side of the coin without seeing the other side. God is wrath..yes i agree....why? Because His people are unrepentant and rebellious. The punishments you read in the Old Testament is indeed harsh and seems merciless on the surface. But careful study we realise that in each and every case God send prophets to warn the people about their sins and wickedness before the judgments fall. Fire dun come down from heaven without warning.<br><br>Jesus Christ is God's mercy and love demonstrated. In Him the sins of the world is atoned for...and do we continue to say God is mean and cruel?</div>

Why is every living thing punish just because adam and eve eat a fruit when the tree has more ? Let me ask when God create a flood and killed off almost the whole human kind and all animals, r they all truly guilty ? Is the baby in the womb of mothers innocent then ? Is the monkeys tat lived in trees "guilty" and deserevd to be drowned ? In christian sense, when u r just born u have already sinned. Is tis fair ? When Job is being tested, god killed off all his family members. R they guilty of anything ? When god kill off all the first born in egypt, does he also kill off many innocent people who cannot defy the pharoah's order ? If god told u to kill off LKY now otherwise u will die, wat can u do ? Where is your element of "unrepentant and rebellious" in these cases ? Warning ? Wat warning ? This is not just the surface, it is everywhere. Chapter and chapters of homicides and homicides followed by hideous death by being swallowed into earth or attacked by bears. If u still justify his actions, then u might as well justify hitler when he killed off the jews. god acts just like the emperor and killed off people just because they r not "obedient". R u a dog tat need to be obedient to be pet and killed off if u just become "disobedient" by sh!tting around ?<br><br><blockquote>Jesus Christ is God's mercy and love demonstrated. In Him the sins of the world is atoned for...and do we continue to say God is mean and cruel?</blockquote>Yah right. When he die, wat difference do u see physically ? People still die and everything remains the same. How do u know the sins r atoned ? When it is "atoned" wat happened ? Nothing ! Everything remains the same !<br><br>He is mean and cruel if he ever exist based on his past actions ! Is hitler mean and cruel ? god is much much more cruel and mean than he is. He is even cruel enough to torture and kill his "only son" jesus christ just to make him himself" forgive" men. Why ? Why do he have to do tat ? Why can't he just directly forgive ?</div>

There r many many people, famous philosopher, scientist, and noble people being free thinkers or men with other religons. R they encourage sins or hating love ?
