            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>For whose people who worshipped other gods may be against God but some don't even know who is the true God so how can we blame themselves by our own judgement and judged them as satanist. </blockquote>Aiii.... how do u know your god is the real god ? Up till now nobody has given me a satisfactory answer on tis issue. The only answer given is just... blind faith... "Our god is true because we believe it is true". Alas... if things were so simple then all the believers of other religion have god which r true. All the principles Aristotle had claimed would also be true. He had claim many principles of physics without actually proving them or conducting experiments. Some principles are a heavier object will fall to the ground first then a loghter one. He just think about them and came up with an answer which he think is reasonable. Most of his theories r proven wrong now.<br><br><blockquote>God himself is kind, his constant love and mercy are often awaiting us to ask for forgiveness and he will forgive us as we have forgiven whose who sins against us.</blockquote>Another question which I have been asking is in the bible, wat deeds of love does God exhibits ? He freed the people from the slavery of egypt forcefully by killing a lot of egytians. He warn Noah to build an ark only to kill the rest of the population. Please tell me some of the kind, peaceful or good deeds he had done.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Your belief tat god is "kind and merciful" may all be just some priest or church propangada. Propanganda which was spinned out from humans.</div>
