Then just last friday when i open whatsapp, he was gone from my favourites list. I rolled down my contacts and his status and whatsapp picture was missing. When I clicked his contact info, it writes "Invite to WhatsApp, Email Conversations, Clear Conversations." His profile went missing D: Was I blocked or did he deleted whatsapp or is this a bug? I don't even talk to him that much because I do not want to seem clingy but he is a really good friend. He talks alot, listens alot, very likeable. While everyone talks about relationships and stuff, he was the only one talking about haunted movies and his hobbies. He is so unique and I really like him as a friend. I really need help with my Whatsapp issue. I don't dare to ask him if he blocked me though. I didnt bothered him or anything. The last message I sent him was "Good luck for the examinations!" and he replied " Oh ok!"</p></div>
