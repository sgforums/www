            <div class='col-md body'>by Mamak Cock and Nyonya Kway<br><br>The Gahmen is reporting a roaring success at the various stalls it is operating at the Chinese New Year Festive Bazaar in Chinatown.<br><br>This was a repeat of the success it reported at the Ramadan/Hari Raya Geylang Bazaar held last year.<br><br>The first stall is run by DPM (soon to be PM) BG Barry Lee, who was letting go firecrackers, seen for the first time in Singapore since the early 70s.<br><br>Â“Who better to run a fireworks stand?Â” said the Gahmen press attachÃ© Mr. Gerry Mandhir. Â“HeÂ’s a real hot shot now.Â”<br><br>Fireworks were allowed again to conjure a certain nostalgia, Mr. Mandhir said. When asked if it was to perhaps conjure nostalgia for another 70s era event, such as a dominant Lee prime ministership, Mr. Mandhir merely cleared his throat extravagantly.<br><br>Meanwhile, an attempt by opposition politician JB Jeyaretnam to set up a similar firecracker stall was stopped by the police, on the grounds that Mr. Jeyaretnam was committing Â“inflammatory acts.Â”<br><br>The National Solidarity PartyÂ’s Steve ChiaÂ’s striptease show was also denied a permit.<br><br>Some former MPs and old guards of the PAP had also set up a stall selling kites. Former Minister David Lim was on hand, demonstrating his kite skills while telling others, Â“See? You can still be a high flyer even after being told to go fly kite.Â”<br><br>Meanwhile, Minister of State for Mat Affairs Mr. Jacob Abraham had taken a break from operating his halal bak kua stall, to fly his own kite for members of the Malay community, as part of a inter-community bonding exercise. Â“You see? Our kite was made with much less money, but it still flies as high as Mr. LimÂ’s! That is meritokrasi!Â”<br><br>When someone pointed out that his kite was actually stuck in a tree and nowhere near Mr. LimÂ’s, Mr. Sniff said, sniffily, Â“ThatÂ’s because your perspective is just to look for excuses to keep yourself low, and are not aiming high enough.Â”<br><strong><br>The Gahmen had also set up a wayang stage, presenting a traditional Hakka opera titled, Â“The Heavenly KingsÂ”. It was a classic tale of how a sleepy fishing village was transformed when lightning struck them, and were ruled by two successive heavenly kings. One day, the village faced a lot of trouble, but the second heavenly king told them, donÂ’t worry, all will be better when the Sun arises. And true enough, all was better when the Sun arose.<br></strong><br>By most accounts, the opera was a success. Onlooker Mr. Kuah Wah Yang said, Â“There was only one small cockup. <strong>It was when someone missed a cue for the Sun to arise, and kena slap by the person playing the Sun.Â”</strong><br><br>Other stallholders were generally supportive of the Gahmen doing business side-by-side with them. Said waxed sausage seller Madam Boey Lap Cheong, Â“They a bit the inconsiderate, lah, because their stall all very the spiak and get a lot of customer who might otherwise come to us to buy things. But you know, I see it as the Gahmen holding my hand to teach me how to compete in the free market.Â”<br><br>Â“Except this market not free, because the stall rental damn high,Â” she added, after a pause.<br><br>Â© http://www.TalkingCock.com 2001-2003.
