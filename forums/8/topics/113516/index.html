The only advantage to it is a cheaper MRT/Bus monthly concession pass. While we have to pay more for our transport, the JC students are still paying 45 cents!

            <div class='col-md body'>Shade343,<br>From Pasir Ris to Toa Payoh by MRT, it would cost you $1.49 per trip. Assuming that you can take bus 88 from Pasir Ris Bus Interchange, it would cost you $1.43 per trip but the time taken would be much longer.<br><br>It would cost me $1.33 per trip to get from Toa Payoh to one bus stop after Tanah Merah MRT station and then I have to walk to work via Bedok Park connector. The return trip would cost me $0.63+$1.23-$0.25=$1.61 if I take another bus to Bedok interchange before changing to bus 26 which would be much faster than taking bus 31 only.</div>
