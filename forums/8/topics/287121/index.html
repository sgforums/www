            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone.<br><br>I'm inquiring on the admission into NUS via category A (ie A level holders). So far, I achieved a median result for my BBCB, GP A2) and I hold an international degree in economics. I was wondering, in regards to the competition of vacancies, how will I fare? Will my degree be of any help (since I'm applying via category A) ?<br><br>I realise I did badly for my A levels, but my degree is currently honours 2(i) (second upper division), and I was wondering if they will take that into account (aside from the university computation scores).<br><br>Thanks!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No offence alright TS - but I think you're an absolute loser. You are the very kind of guy that girls stay away from - so old already no career, with retarded thoughts about going back to school; it is highly contradictory to what you assert - that you chase the dollar.<br><br>You've got to be pretty old; given the way you speak, and the fact you have already finished your undergraduate studies.<br><br>I know many people with external degrees (offshore) who have gone on to really successful careers.<br><br>Provided you ace your interview (not some beng beng lian lian who can't speak proper, fluent English etc.), your econs degree will take you places - private banker (relationship managers), even managerial positions. R'ship managers have a decent base, + the potential for alot of commission - not uncommon for the successful ones to make $8k/mth; provided you are driven, and ambitious enough ... but looking at the way you are, probably not.<br><br>If you siad you wanted to do an MBA, that would at least make sense to me, because you're moving one level up, and building upon your degree. Even then, going full time ... you must either be a spoilt rich kid, or grossly successful in the first quarter of your life and thus, able to take a break to pursue further studies.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just like Medicine. Many people doesn't have the A level grades or Poly grades to make it to Medicine. So what do they do? They went study for Biomedical Science or some related Bachelor degree and use it for Medicine Admission.</div>

You are the very kind of guy that girls stay away from - so old already no career, with retarded thoughts about going back to school; it is highly contradictory to what you assert - that you chase the dollar.<br><br>You've got to be pretty old; given the way you speak, and the fact you have already finished your undergraduate studies.<br><br>I know many people with external degrees (offshore) who have gone on to really successful careers.<br><br>Provided you ace your interview (not some beng beng lian lian who can't speak proper, fluent English etc.), your econs degree will take you places - private banker (relationship managers), even managerial positions. R'ship managers have a decent base, + the potential for alot of commission - not uncommon for the successful ones to make $8k/mth; provided you are driven, and ambitious enough ... but looking at the way you are, probably not.<br><br>If you siad you wanted to do an MBA, that would at least make sense to me, because you're moving one level up, and building upon your degree. Even then, going full time ... you must either be a spoilt rich kid, or grossly successful in the first quarter of your life and thus, able to take a break to pursue further studies.</div></blockquote>First of all, you're highly contradictory too.<br><br>You called me an absolute loser with retarded thoughts of going back to school who girls stay away from who might be spoilt and rich and unambitious and undriven but you meant no offense? Am I suppose to feel like that is some non-offensive mumbo-jumbo?<br><br>You gather I am ''old'' just by the way I speak - so tell me, how do I speak? Can I also make the same assumption by the way you speak - that you're just a boy filled with angst looking for an outlet for all that anger? Is it fair for me to make snap judgments over a single post (or two)? You seem to derive joy from shooting arrows to people you don't know from the safety of your computer screen.<br><br>I don't see how it is fair for you to make such statements to me. I'm asking an honest question in the forum, am I not?<br><br>Explain how right you are in saying what you did.</div>
