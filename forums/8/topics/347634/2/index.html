              <p>boring, i remember there is saying about PHD, permanent head
              damage, engineering is too far away from life. You learn
              engineering, you cannot talk about it with ladies.</p>
              <p>And i feel the lecturer in NTU, some of them , when giving
              lecture, they are sweating, some already lose the function of
              chating,</p>
              <p>With all the money in the world, they will not be happy,</p>
              <p>There do have some brilliant lecturer, but cannot ignore those
              "bore you to death"  killers.</p>
              <p>Some people are not good at engineering, they are attracted by
              the money there, they want a steady job, if you are not the
              material , don't do it.</p>
              <p>I once work  for a company, when i was do the wiring for
              the machine, i saw the sales, dress suit, drinking coffee,
              chatting,</p>
              <p>i realize, the money is not good enough, see those sales,
              talking here and there, making good money,</p>
              <p>above all the factor, the most important, thing is engineeing,
              refrain your thought.</p>
              <p>You engineer, don't think engineering make the world more
              beautifull, you also build weapon, there is where the most advance

              <p>boring, i remember there is saying about PHD, permanent head
              damage, engineering is too far away from life. You learn
              engineering, you cannot talk about it with ladies.</p>
              <p>And i feel the lecturer in NTU, some of them , when giving
              lecture, they are sweating, some already lose the function of
              chating,</p>
              <p>With all the money in the world, they will not be happy,</p>
              <p>There do have some brilliant lecturer, but cannot ignore those
              "bore you to death"  killers.</p>
              <p>Some people are not good at engineering, they are attracted by
              the money there, they want a steady job, if you are not the
              material , don't do it.</p>
              <p>I once work  for a company, when i was do the wiring for
              the machine, i saw the sales, dress suit, drinking coffee,
              chatting,</p>
              <p>i realize, the money is not good enough, see those sales,
              talking here and there, making good money,</p>
              <p>above all the factor, the most important, thing is engineeing,
              refrain your thought.</p>
              <p>You engineer, don't think engineering make the world more
              beautifull, you also build weapon, there is where the most advance
              technology goes.</p>

              <p>As a local uni grad, i disagree with the OP's generalistic comment... I do believe local undergraduates need more exposure... But i do also know that the local unis are stepping up in that aspect by providing better exposure for students...</p>

              <p>However, what matters is still the individual... If a person is content confining him or herself to a space, there's no amount of exposure than can change their perspective or horizons...

              <p>ok i put this way, engineering thought is different from the commonly adopted thought,</p>
              <p>sometimes, when you are doing computing, when your thought are fleeting, it really cannot work out,</p>
              <p>1+1=2, is made by man, you have to remember it, someone think math is important , because the 1+1=2, you cannot observe and learn from nature, it's purely man made, and they think it's higher than nature, it's derived by logical and philosophical training.</p>
              <p>in your system you could make 1+1 equal to anything</p>
              <p>of course i am not talking about 1+1, the college math is much difficult.</p>
              <p>Killing me.</p>
              <p>Sometimes you have fun in reading, in painting,</p>
              <p>seldom you see someone enjoy doing engineering, the candidate qualified for being engineer, i think at least there is one factor, they are not so bored in doing it,</p>
              <p>no one having fun doing it. it's only bunch of job , work, do it for money,</p>
              <p>eagle said you could learn some analytical skill. Maybe, i think maybe you could learn it by logic, engineering is only bunch of tools, making money , yes, whatever other thing you want to learn from engineering, you could learn it somewhere else.</p>
              <p>By reading.</p>
              <p>Some one are computer fan, like i did, but engineering, is totally different, i tell you</p>
