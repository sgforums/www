              <p>Its not like it got bad memory, its just that my recollection has a habit of "resetting" while im thinking of something or trying to remember something.  Eg, when I'm trying to recall the themes or concept of something... suddenly there is a pause in the thought process then -BLANK-.  </p>
              <p>Thankfully, some of my friends know that, and will casually remind me of what I was thinking about in the first place.</p>
              <p>Still, when it comes to maths, its easier.  Practice always makes perfect.  But when it comes to thematic and conceptual applications, its a lot harder.  </p>

              <p>Agreed!</p>
              <p>That way... you are dead before the battle begins...</p>
              <p>Another thing about students is that.... why score 90 marks when 70 marks can already give you an A? I had classmates like these before.... telling me when I scored 90 and above... Now I think back... it's like... wtf? Why limit yourself, limit your potential? Why don't just aim for 100 and allow yourself to have a buffer of 30 marks for careless mistakes? Isn't that better?</p>
              <p>And another bad attitude that some students have.... This question/topic is too hard. Let's skip and move on to an easier one... BS la... The tougher the topic, the more you should do to train yourself up in that area...</p>

              <p>Yes i agree with you on that... but this is life, without people to make up the masses, it won't be that simple to get 2nd upper and above...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Reconciling eagle's point with the OP's comments, the question to ask ourselves or our education system is, are we rewarding people who work their asses off to get that first class honours (whom according to the OP goes on and makes bad decisions at work later on), or should we be putting our focus on those with the potential and capabilities to excel...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It all boils down to the question of innate talents/capabilites vs. effort-derived results... From the point of view of an "elitist", i am inclined to implore our education/scoring system to move towards picking out the "true elites" and developing them... How that will be done remains another question of course...</p>

              <p>Actually I think... we shouldn't think of being developed by the education system... It is tantamount to being reared and raised like a prize bull!</p>
              <p>My opinion is, if you are good, society will reward you sufficiently... Getting a first class honours doesn't necessary mean that the person is good.... Not being a uni grad doesn't mean the person is bad...</p>
              <p>Development or grooming by the govt is actually a term used by them to "snatch" what they think are "smart" people to the civil service, and give them scholarships, etc, to bond them to the civil service for a long time. If you can't survive, you will be cast aside, and find it even harder to be "rewarded". Yet if you are very good, it might take donkey years to be "rewarded".</p>
