              <p><br>What's this?!<br><br><strong style="color: orange;"><a href="http://lwb.lawnet.com.sg/legal/lgl/rss/subcourts/65923.html"><span style="color: #ff9900;">Previously sentenced to 6 weeks of jail for driving without a licence</span></a></strong>, Catherine Peter (wife of a commercial pilot, housewife, and mother of 2) has gotten her jail term dropped in her latest appeal.<br><br><strong><em>"<a style="color: orange;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V._K._Rajah">Justice V K Rajah</a> decided to set aside the jail sentence, saying that <span style="color: cyan;">Peter was not likely to repeat the offence</span>. He added that "this decision does not signify the present judicial status ... but it is a one-off case that commands a departure from the norm". "</em></strong><br><br>Fwah! So special for her... <br><br>Please! She's obviously recalcitrant!<br>Know why she was driving <strong><em>without</em><em> licence</em></strong> on 29 Aug 2009? Coz her licence had been previously suspended for <em><strong>drink-driving</strong></em> on 9 Apr 2009, <em><strong>just 4 months ago</strong></em>! If this is not being recalcitrant, what is? Simpy no regard for our laws.<span class="txt-body"> </span><br><br><span class="txt-body">She claims that she had to drive without a licence to the mall coz she couldn't find a cab and had to get to the mall to buy her sick son a toy. Guess where her husband was while their son was ill? </span><span class="txt-body">The commercial pilot was not overseas flying, but was in Singapore. He had gone to the SIA Sports Club that afternoon. Was her son really sick? Or perhaps she's a self-suffering wife holding the family together on her own? Hence, having to make unthinking decisions such as driving without licence just 4 months after getting caught for drink-driving?</span><br><br>While the report avoids mentioning the nationality or immigration status of Catherine Peter, it's quite obvious that her husband is a Foreign Talent and these are probably a couple of PRs or even New Citizens. This would explain why the judge had decided to drop the jail term, because by default for PRs/foreigners, who have been sentenced to jail in Singapore, cannot step foot in Singapore again. (Though it may be possible to appeal for re-entry to be granted on a case-by-case basis.)<br><br>Hence, if this woman were to be sentenced to jail as decided in the district court earlier, she would have to leave Singapore after serving her jail term. This would mean that she would not be able to take care of her kids, while her husband was overseas for work. This would also mean that Singapore might altogether lose her husband, i.e.<span class="txt-body"> a Line Instructor and Pilot of the A380 fleet, Flight Operations Division of Singapore Airlines.  </span><br><br>Even if the complications arising from their immigration status were disregarded, it makes one wonder if we had ever jailed a mother of young children, rendering these children 'motherless' for some time. Is it more ok then to jail local mothers coz their kids could be taken care of by the extended family in Singapore?<br><br><span class="txt-body">Will the Prosecution be appealing against the appeal decision?</span></p>

              <p><span class="txt-body">Just a few days ago, I put up a blog entry, lamenting that if we ever got into trouble with non-Singaporeans, <a href="http://blinkymummy.blogspot.com/2010/04/who-will-fight-with-us.html"><span style="color: #ff9900;">how unlikely it was for fellow Singaporeans to fight along side with us in Cambridge</span></a>. <br><br>'Good Fren' suggested that the only time such 'support' by Singaporeans would be possible was if we got into a fight during a sports meet where Singaporeans from Oxford and Cambridge played against one another, i.e. è‡ªå·±äººæ‰“è‡ªå·±äºº.<br><br>You would think 'Good Fren' was exaggerating. <br><br>Then over the weekend... <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><span style="font-size: large;">TA-DAH!!</span></strong><br><br></span>We get a real-life example, i.e. <strong style="color: orange;"><a href="http://www.asiaone.com/News/Education/Story/A1Story20100413-209958.html"><span style="color: #ff9900;">front page news of Singaporean school boys bashing one another up during and after a Rugby match.</span></a></strong><br><br>Meanwhile, few have learnt about the latest sports news that <strong><a href="http://blinkymummy.blogspot.com/2010/04/ah-lian-will-never-make-it-in-singapore.html"><span style="color: #ff9900;">our foreign talent Olympic Silver Medalist joining the team in her former hometown</span></a></strong>, because the same mainstream papers have not mention any word about it.<br><br>Hello?!! Wake up! Wake up!<br>Stop wasting energy on mindless competition amongst ourselves! While we were busy fighting ourselves, the aliens have come and left with bags of gold oredi!!   <br><br><strong style="color: cyan;">Related note:</strong> If the online community is guilty of '<strong style="color: cyan;">astroturfing</strong>', i.e. creating false impressions of certain views, by spamming formal channels, the mainstream media ain't that much better either.<br><br>Omitting significant pieces of news (and/or only highlighting partial truths) is just another way to create false impressions</span></p>
