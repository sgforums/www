            <div class='col-md body'>Meaningful ~ Learn 2 accepts him/her d way he/she<br>is!!!<br><br>A man and his girlfriend were married. It was a<br>large celebration. All of their friends and<br>family came to see the lovely ceremony and to<br>partake of the activities and celebrations. A<br>wonderful time was had by all. The bride was<br>gorgeous in her white wedding gown and the groom<br>was very dashing in his black tuxedo. Everyone<br>could tell that the love they had for each other<br>was true.<br><br>A few months later, the wife comes to the husband<br>with a proposal: I read in a magazine, a while<br>ago, about how we can strengthen our marriage."<br>She offered. "Each of us will write a list of the<br>things that we find a bit annoying with the other<br>person. Then, we can talk about how we can fix<br>them together and make our lives happier<br>together." The husband agreed. So each of them<br>went to a separate room in the house and thought<br>of the things that annoyed them about the other.<br>They thought about this question for the rest of<br>the day and wrote down what they came up with.<br>The next morning, at the breakfast table, they<br>decided that they would go over their lists.<br><br>"I'll start," offered the wife. She took out her<br>list. It had many items on it. Enough to fill 3<br>pages, in fact. As she started reading the list<br>of the little annoyances, she noticed that tears<br>were starting to appear in her husband's eyes.<br><br>"What's wrong?" she asked. "Nothing" the husband<br>replied, "Keep reading your list." The wife<br>continued to read until she had read all three<br>pages to her husband. She<br>neatly placed her list on the table and folded<br>her hands over top of it. "Now, you read your<br>list and then we'll talk about the things on both<br>of our lists." She said happily.<br>Quietly the husband stated, "I don't have<br>anything on my list. I think that you are perfect<br>the way that you are. I don't want you to change<br>anything for me. You are lovely and wonderful and<br>I wouldn't want to try and change anything about<br>you." The wife, touched by his honesty and the<br>depth of his love for her and his acceptance of<br>her, turned her head and wept.<br><br>In life, there are enough times when we are<br>disappointed, depressed and annoyed. We don't<br>really have to go looking for them. We have a<br>wonderful world that is full of beauty, light and<br>promise. Why waste time in this world looking for<br>the bad, disappointing or annoying when we can<br>look<br></div>
