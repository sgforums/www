            <div class='col-md body'>Musharraf calls for jihad against Islamic militants<br>By Sam Knight, Times Online<br><br>The President of Pakistan has called on his people to undertake a jihad, or holy war, against religious extremism in a speech about the wave of arrests that he has ordered in the aftermath of the London bombings on July 7.<br><br>"I urge you, my nation, to stand up and wage jihad against extremism and to stand up against those who spread hatred and chaos in the society," said President Pervez Musharraf in an hour-long televised address.<br><br>Security forces in Pakistan said today they have arrested 228 suspected militants and extremist clerics in a series of raids on religious schools and private homes over the last week after three of the four London bombers were found to have links to the country.<br><br>General Musharraf expressed regret that the investigation into the July 7 bombings had shown strong links between Pakistani militants and the British men that carried out the attacks, but he also stressed that Britain must tighten its control over its own fundamentalist groups.<br><br>"There is a lot to be done by Pakistan internally," he said. "And may I suggest there is a lot to be done in England also. The current strategy to deal with this is to encourage and support each other rather than speaking against each other and blaming each other and weakening the overall cause."<br><br>General Musharraf condemned the July 7 bombings in strong terms, saying that he doubted that the "perpetrators of this act can be called human beings," before reiterating his request that British authorities do more to close down extremist groups in the UK.<br><br>"There is Hizb Ur-Tahrir and al-Muhajiroun, who operate with full impunity in that area," he said, referring to two radical Islamist groups in Britain. "They had the audacity of passing an edict against my life and yet they operate with impunity."<br><br>General Musharraf said that the campaign to gain control over fundamentalist groups in Pakistan would continue, and that all Islamic schools, or madrassas, would have to register with authorities by December.<br><br>Madrassas, especially those that impose strict, spartan regimes of Islamist teaching on young, impressionable men, are seen as important sources of recruitment to radical Islamic groups in Pakistan. Two of the London bombers are thought to have visited a series of madrassas when they visited Pakistan earlier this year.<br><br>The President also announced measures to increase government control over unauthorised weapons and provocative literature designed to spread religious hatred. He also promised that prohibited militant groups would not be allowed to re-organise under new names or to raise funds.<br><br>The Times reported today that Haroon Rashid Aswat, a man wanted by British authorities as the possible organiser of the attacks, was arrested at a madrassa at Sargodha, 90 miles from Islamabad, in the last few days.<br><br>Speaking at a memorial service to mark the July 7 bombings, the British High Commissioner in Pakistan denied that report.<br><br>"Let me take this opportunity to clarify that there have not been any arrests in Pakistan since July 7 related to the London bombings," said Mark Lyall Grant.</div>
