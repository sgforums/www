It's due to the whole environment being opened up. The majority of people are introduced to different parts of the world where we can see we have different choices. That's why we're opening up.'<br><br>So it's inevitable that Singapore will become more relaxed?<br><br>'Yes, it's inevitable. We have to go along where the whole world is going, but we have to pace ourselves, not too fast. If it's too fast, there's going to be chaos.'<br><br>But will young people have the patience to wait?<br><br>'Well, you have different opinions... erm... there's no right or wrong. It's basically about your own opinion. So I don't know. I'm okay with that. I don't touch politics.'<br><br>However, she gave Peschardt the impression that security is so strict here that they may be chased out of the shopping mall - even though they have papers that grant them entry to film.<br><br>It got him curious - he even asked in jest 'Will we be sent to jail?'.<br><br>But the walk was so smooth that Peschardt joked that he felt disappointed not to be thrown out.<br><br>Having been to Bollywood where he met mega stars like Aishwarya Rai and Preity Zinta who get mobbed if they leave their homes, he was pleasantly surprised Fann received only curious stares.<br><br>Even if there were fans of hers in the crowd, he noted they were almost too shy to approach her.<br><br>Fann explained that Singaporeans are shy of cameras, but they are 'much more better now' and slowly opening up with the introduction of cable and the Internet.<br><br>As for Singapore's reputation of being a clean city, Fann had no fresh perspectives to offer either.<br><br>When asked if our orderliness and cleanliness is 'almost so perfect', she quickly waved it off but added she appreciates the smooth traffic and clean environment.<br><br>But doesn't she find it a bit artificial, pressed Peschardt.<br><br>A LITTLE FLUSTERED<br><br>Looking a little flustered, Fann paused for a good six seconds before she finally said: 'No, but I have friends who say that it's artificial. But no, I'm grateful to be here.'<br><br>But the actress was able to offer some insight into how Asians are more tolerant of violence while Europians have higher threshold for nudity, based on her experience from the German film, House Of Harmony.<br><br>She also shared how it was tough working with Jackie Chan on the Hollywood flick Shanghai Knights, because he was a perfectionist and she had to train 'really hard' on her fight scenes.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>FANN'S ANSWER<br><br>Do young people approve of Singapore being too restrictive or do they want greater freedom?<br>Fann: We don't really have a choice, but a lot depends. It's due to the whole environment being opened up. The majority of people are introduced to different parts of the world where we can see we have different choices. That's why we're opening up.<br><br>So it's inevitable that Singapore will become more relaxed?<br>Yes, it's inevitable.

It's basically about your own opinion. So I don't know. I'm okay with that. I don't touch politics.'<br><br>Everything works in Singapore. There's a resort feel and there's cleanliness. But does it ever get on your nerves? Because it seems almost perfect?<br>Fann: 'Perfect? No no no, if you live in Singapore you'll know that it's not so perfect. You ask her! (Points to manager beside her.) But I really appreciate the smooth traffic and how it's clean.'<br><br></div>
