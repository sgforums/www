            <div class='col-md body'>Being the first Singaporean to be featured on the BBC World documentary series Peschardt's People (above) last Saturday, she really shouldn't have done so. Maybe she didn't knwo what BBC was, ahem, sorry, it's not like Channel 8 where you see flimsy shallow dramas. She actually thought she was on BBC to talk about herself, perhaps explaining the non-sensical answers. Does she really think she is Nelson Mandela that the BBC would invite her to actually talk about <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">herself</span></strong>??<br><br>Look at her answers.. they make no sense at all and seem to be verbal diarrhea.<br><br>Q1: Do young people approve of Singapore being too restrictive or do they want greater freedom?<br>A: We don't really have a choice, but a lot depends. It's due to the whole environment being opened up. The majority of people are introduced to different parts of the world where we can see we have different choices. That's why we're opening up. (But will young people have the patience to wait?) Well, you have different opinions... erm... there's no right or wrong. It's basically about your own opinion. So I don't know. I'm okay with that. I don't touch politics.<br><br>Q2: Everything works in Singapore. There's a resort feel and there's cleanliness. But does it ever get on your nerves? Because it seems almost perfect? Don't you find that a bit artificial?<br>A: Perfect? No no no, if you live in Singapore you'll know that it's not so perfect. You ask her! (Points to manager beside her.) But I really appreciate the smooth traffic and how it's clean.<br><br>Artificial? (pauses and thinks for 6 seconds) No, but I have friends who say that it's artificial. But no, I'm grateful to be here.<br><br></div>

Forget the excuse about being busy - surely there are other people who are busier and can come up with better answers than this without even trying.<br><br>Like I said, her expectations are caused by a very mistaken conception, i.e. why would BBC be interviewing her to talk about her when she is no great businesswoman nor politician. Neither is she going on Entertainment Tonight or something.<br><br>I don't think it is a valid reason that just because one is an "artiste" he/she is uncapable of discussing such issues intelligently. For one, I think Ix Shen is pretty intellectual. There are tons of actors and actresses who are able to discuss issues intellectually, e.g. Edward Norton. We rarely have actors/actresses in Singapore who have had tertiary education in they field (eg, drama) etc. It is really no excuse at all. But perhaps it is an accurate picture to get Fann Wong on BBC to embarrass SIngapore on international TV, for this is how most people here would respond...unfortunately.</div>

The ang mohs tend to have this perception of Singapore as some kind of dictatorial police state where everything works but political expression is not allowed. Many Singaporeans studying in the UK and US do get asked this kind of questions very often.<br><br>From the interview transcript it does appear that Fann Wong handled these questions quite poorly. Perhaps she's really not very intellectual and just never thought about such things before, but a good PR manager would have been able to anticipate these problems and prepare her for them beforehand.</div>

Maybe she didn't knwo what BBC was, ahem, sorry, it's not like Channel 8 where you see flimsy shallow dramas. She actually thought she was on BBC to talk about herself, perhaps explaining the non-sensical answers. Does she really think she is Nelson Mandela that the BBC would invite her to actually talk about [b]<span style="font-style: italic;">herself</span></strong>??<br><br>Look at her answers.. they make no sense at all and seem to be verbal diarrhea.<br><br>Q1: Do young people approve of Singapore being too restrictive or do they want greater freedom?<br>A: We don't really have a choice, but a lot depends. It's due to the whole environment being opened up. The majority of people are introduced to different parts of the world where we can see we have different choices. That's why we're opening up. (But will young people have the patience to wait?) Well, you have different opinions... erm... there's no right or wrong. It's basically about your own opinion. So I don't know. I'm okay with that. I don't touch politics.<br><br>Q2: Everything works in Singapore. There's a resort feel and there's cleanliness. But does it ever get on your nerves? Because it seems almost perfect? Don't you find that a bit artificial?<br>A: Perfect? No no no, if you live in Singapore you'll know that it's not so perfect. You ask her! (Points to manager beside her.) But I really appreciate the smooth traffic and how it's clean.<br><br>Artificial? (pauses and thinks for 6 seconds) No, but I have friends who say that it's artificial. But no, I'm grateful to be here.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Walan...<br><br>MediaCorp, please tell Fann next time to shut up if don't know what to say.<br><br>At least just say No Comments!<br><br>Better than all those rubbish!!<br><br></div>
