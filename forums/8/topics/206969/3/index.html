            <div class='col-md body'>The standard of general knowledge from our Mediacorp artistes is definitely lacking, more so when you realise you are about to get interviewed on BBC. Anyone who was preparing for such an interview would surely have been better prepared.<br><br>This only enhances the West's preception of Singaporeans and Asians as a backwater culture, too conservative and 2nd best to western practices.<br><br>Fann's response to the political question was 'decrepit' to say the least. She should have expected a robust line of questioning from the BBC, rather than naive dialogue.<br><br>This reminds me of Ms Singapore Universe 2001 when Mark Van Cuylenberg (Flying dutchman) had to prompt one of the contestants over a line of Q &amp; A becuase she couldn't understand the question.<br></div>

No thanks to the govt having done such a wonderful job........in restricting the media and political podcasts over the internet. There are a number who are dissatisfied with the tight rein this govt has held and are looking forward to a change. Sad to say, this is very unlikely for the next 10 years at least. Awareness of politics amongst the young is growing though.</span><br><br>So it's inevitable that Singapore will become more relaxed?<br><br><span style="color: blue;">It will.....but not that much....as long as the ruling party is still at the helm. They always have a way to right the wrongs and wrong the right, so...we are in a bit of a political and social retardation, if you know what I mean.</span><br><br>But will young people have the patience to wait?<br><br><span style="color: blue;">We don't have a choice! It is this long wait which forces a lot of us into political apathy. One cannot really voice netizen views via the media and cannot organise talks crtiticising the govt. Only option is to join an opposition party and await their chance every 5 years of election. To even dream of an opposition party seizing power in our lifetime..... may after all, be only a dream.</span><br><br>Everything works in Singapore. There's a resort feel and there's cleanliness. But does it ever get on your nerves? Because it seems almost perfect?<br><br><span style="color: blue;">You bet! It does get on my nerves. It's really a joy filming in other countries, seeing student demonstations and unorderly roads etc, just reinforces my belief that this world finds beauty in imperfection. Just take a cab out of Changi Airport and you will see this long....long....long stretch of road where the trees are all of the same breed and the same size. It's not coincidental but done on purpose to impress. Well, nothing wrong, just that it irritates me hahaha.</span><br></div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
