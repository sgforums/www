            <div class='col-md body'>Power 98 DJ's remarks 'extremely offensive'<br>I WAS tuned into the Power 98 Double J Morning Jam on Sept 14 at 7.30am on my way to work, when DJ 'JA' noted that 'four out of five marriages are initiated by men and four out of five divorces are initiated by women'.<br><br>He triumphantly concluded that 'men build marriages and women destroy marriages'.<br><br>I found this extremely offensive.<br><blockquote><br>The DJ demonstrated an irresponsible use of statistics, showed complete insensitivity to the difficult subject of divorce and displayed a chauvinism that was shocking (aggravated by an additional comment that his fellow DJ's fiancee should be kept in line by being told to scrub the floors).<br><br>It was clearly not meant as a joke as not the slightest apology was made in the next 10 minutes.<br><br>Public radio stations (especially one representing Safra) and their DJs have a certain social responsibility. The DJ's comments could be hurtful to anyone going through a divorce.<br><br>Furthermore, perpetuating such stereotypes is irresponsible. How does one explain this to impressionable young children who hear the programme on their way to school?<br><br>I hope Power 98 will take action to ensure its DJs act in a more socially appropriate manner.<br><br>JO-ANN TAN (MS)</blockquote> - <span style="font-style: italic;">taken from ST, Sep 20 2004</span><br><br>knn, last time chubby got the boot coz he tok abt undergarments now JAmmy gonna kiss grass coz he cracked a joke abt marriages? pls lah...SUA KU poreans, if ur so bloody sensitive dun listen to the bloody leh lio, little bit oso buay tahan go die better!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>At the rate things seem to be moving, we need foreign talents to replace our local DJs pretty soon, if our local boys say something crude or just not socially accepted in Asian culture we are lambasted with labels that state we are insensitive or just plain rude/ low crass. BUT if an angmoh were to say it, everyone would think his a cheeky fella and laugh along with him because its in their culture to be more naturally open and speak more freely. So what gives?<br><br>Why set double standards for ourselves? We are using the same sort of mentality the SPGs have. We belittle ourselves when some of us try to express themselves, and when others do it we congratulate them. Whose the one hiding in the hole here? Its high time people start accepting that there are others who talk more openly, think more openly and have a sense of humour. For peteÂ’s sake this aint the HAN Dynasty, we donÂ’t walk to towns, we speak English not dialects when we converse.<br><br>If the listener who wrote in found the comments insensitive, I think she should open her eyes a little wider, JAÂ’s line pales in comparison to what TV talkshow hosts like Jay Leno or Letterman have sprouted thus far, u want a taste of the media? Go listen to Howard Stern, his antics on US national radio has earned him notoriety worldwide.<br><br>What the listener is doing is limiting creativity, how can we progress if backward mongrels like her continue to dog the system with prehistoric ramblings? As long it is done in good taste I donÂ’t see the point in apologizing for what he said.<br><br>In fact there was nothing to sensitive about. If people going through divorces are that easily affected by a DJÂ’s comments, I suggest psychiatric help immediately. JA simply added his 2cents is that so hard to accept? If a government body were to state that, then a inquiry would be called for.<br><br>Hakiel had to go because the lewd remarks he gave were uncalled for, that was understandable, but this? This is pure absurdity. As a former student of Mass Communications I find this disheartening. If DJÂ’s were to watch every word they said, pretty soon we would need scripts instead of spontaneous banter on air. Live Radio broadcasts were pretty much be dead done in by Dodos like Miss TanÂ…<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Power 98 sorry about DJ's remarks on divorce<br>I REFER to the letter from Ms Jo-Ann Tan ('Power 98 DJ's remarks 'extremely offensive'; ST, Sept 20). The Double J Morning Jam show was delivering a factual report on divorce statistics.<br><br>The statistics were taken out of context by JA and used inappropriately. We apologise if his statement caused offence. His interpretation of the statistics was a misjudgment on his part.<br><br>Fellow DJ Jeremy Ratnam ended the discussion on air by giving an alternative point of view. He said that women should not be blamed for failed marriages, as there could be valid reasons why they filed for divorce.<br><br>Power98 DJs have always been reminded to stay away from offensive material, and not to break the Media Development Authority's code.<br><br>We will continue to be careful with our treatment of sensitive topics.<br><br>SHAREEN WONG (MS)<br>Programming Manager, Power98FM<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I REFER to Ms Jo-Ann Tan's letter. I agree that radio stations owe the public a certain measure of social responsibility.<br><br>However, Singaporeans cannot, on the one hand, clamour for less media regulation and more social freedoms and, on the other hand, take offence at the slightest hint of impropriety.<br><br>The comments by the DJ were meant as a joke and should be taken in that light. The vast majority of listeners would not, for one moment, have construed that comment as fact and to suggest otherwise grossly underestimates their intelligence.<br><br>I for one certainly hope that Singaporeans will not have to live in times where every comment must be qualified and every piece of humour accompanied by a disclaimer.<br><br>If the fabric of our multi-faceted society is to remain intact, we need to take ourselves less seriously and be less sensitive. There would be a lot less friction if all of us could simply learn to take a joke.<br><br>ADRIAN WEE HENG YI</blockquote>Forumites u have just witnessed the end of democracy as we know it...</div>

And they will be quietly sacked the following week. Confirm plus guarantee and chomp!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

There's a distinct fine line drawn where a person can be joking and for a person to be replusive.<br><br>I believe, everyone should take offence if a DJ or someone on the street was to shout racist remarks... or crude remarks...<br><br>How abt basis remarks? Would be it be similar to crude remarks?<br><br>There are several forms of media, newspaper, tv... radio is also one of them. Yes we should have freedom in our media and radio, but you do not hear TV boardcasters or media journalists racking off abt what they think and giving basis views?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think Singaporeans are too ignorant...not open, too many prudes. Technology advance, buildings grow taller but people don't advance. If what other people say offend you and you cannot just listen and bo chap, then either something wrong or you wake up looking to get pissed anyways. I believe you don't like what people say just ignore, why must complain. At this rate Singapore is gonna to turn into the great oh America, where majority of the country is suburban red necks every little bit complain, sue and blame on government.</div>
