            <div class='col-md body'>Lonewolf,<br><br>you're very kind   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> but you don't have to worry about my significant other. There's no deception or illusion on either side.<br><br>Bear,<br><br>i think you're cool too   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I concede that I used a sweeping generalization, but I do sincerely believe that most men will cheat, and only a rare few will be able to be faithful throughout their lives. If you're one of them, that's great. I have nothing against faithful people, and nothing against faithfulness.<br><br>I must however protest against the allegation that I tell women to do the same - ie cheat. That's a personal choice, one must be able to live with it. I cannot live with it, and I do not advocate it as a means of revenge. I do however feel that women too must look after their own interests, and be more "selfish." there are many women who put up with a lot of flaws for the promise of faithfulness and character. If they indeed find a guy with these two respectable qualities, my heartiest congratualations. But becuase I believe that such men are rare, I have nothing against women who instead go for looks and money in a man. It may appear shallow to some like yourselves, but for many others, the emotional turmoil of a relationship brings more unhappiness than happiness. Instead they look for fulfillment in other places, like their children, going travelling with friends, etc.<br><br>2. Yes, a person can meet and break up with several partners before meeting the ones - for a great variety of reasons. what I'm refering to here are those that are damaged by infidelity, though I would also put domestic violence on the list of irreparable damage.<br><br>3. Love is a choice, I agree. We are not machines, we need to love and be loved. That too I agree. However I do not agree that ROMANTIC love is the ONLY thing that makes life fulfilling and worth living. This is a complete fallacy, and one which all of you here subscribed to, judging by the assumption that if I reject the myth of relationships, I am automatically heading down the path of being a dried-up sour old person.<br><br>All the "miserable", "lonely" people you see are in the state becuase of either one or both of the following - 1)they have lost their passion for life, 2) they think that they can only be happy if they find The One.<br><br>To this I say no! Life is more than romance and BGR!<br><br>4. yes, a man who cheats hurts the very one he professes he loves. But many women will still console themselves that at least he is a good father, or provides well for the family, and that she's still luckier than neighbour A or B whose husband comes home drunk and break furniture. And for SOME women who grew up with unfaithful fathers (just an example), faithfulness is not always the first quality they look for nor expect.<br><br>Of course I'm not saying that the hurt can be "erased." If you want the personal best of your partner, you have to give your personal best too. But due to various circumstances, faithfulness do not always come first for everyone.<br><br>5. "a woman who gives herself to someone she does not love sells herself short." - I know what you mean, but what about giving herself to someone whom she doesn't love, but who loves her? What about arranged marriages in which love gradually grows over the years? I'm sure many of us have grandparents who are extrememly loving, but whose marriages were arranged.<br><br>What about the rich man who loves his mistress (who doesn't love him) and spends all his time with her and their kids? She doesn't love him, and she doesn't shed a drop of tear when he dies. But she's happy - she has her own house, she's comfortable, she has her circle of friends and she dotes on her children. This is based on real life.<br><br>The first wife incidentally, had to raise 8 kids in his absence, and they all cried buckets when he passed away.<br><br>Who's selling herself short?<br><br>[This message has been edited by Gine (edited 16 May 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Gine,<br><br>1. I agree wif u tt there're MANY men who do cheat, n I've witnessed it wif my v. own eyes.  These men haf affairs wif women, chase skirts even tho they haf families, etc etc etc.  But really, sometimes it isn't fair to juz point fingers @ the men.  Haf the wifeys themselves done somethg to hurt their hubbies?  Haf the wifies screamed n demanded so much tt the hubbies felt unloved n had to seek for attn elsewhere?  BOTH wld be wrong in this case...  A r'ship is Give n Take.  BOTH parties shd make the effort to give their partner attn, love, n Happiness.<br><br>2. Ur argument is based on the assumption tt since Men cheat, we shd do the same, or we shd look for other areas to focus on, like his $$$.  Again, u may haf seen the Tip of the Iceberg.  Sometimes the wifeys may haf done somethg so Hurtful, the men really give up n look elsewhere.  Of cosh if the wifey is a gd 1, n the silly man is unfaithful, HE is the 1 who's broken Marriage Vows, he'll rec' his Mortal Consequences n his Punishment which is GUILT.<br><br>3. If the wifey has been Beaten, Cheated On, etc when she has done NOTHING to warrant it, there is ONE option --&gt; LEAVE.  They might oso choose the softer option which is to go for Marriage Counselling.  If this option fails, then Leaving wld be the best alternative.<br><br>4. I used to think tt it was better being alone, tt Men were Disgusting Insects, but then afterwards Love found me, n Life cldn't haf been Fuller.  Some pple can go on thinking they dun need Love.  Others do.  That's wat The Bear's saying.  When u say tt All Men cheat --&gt; the generalisation, u r saying tt ALL women NOW, shd look for materials to satisfy wat they can't haf.  But then they wld lose out cosh there're still SOME gd men in the world.<br><br>Lastly, as I noe The Bear personally, I definitely agree wif ur Statement tt The Bear is 1 cool guy  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  He's totally Committed to his girl, n he pampers her wif little thgs tt matter.  It's pple like him n My Guy who give Hope to someone who was as Cynical as I used to be.  Cheers!<br><br>RP</div>
