            <div class='col-md body'>kinda nice to see all of you throwing brickbats at me actually - shows that some idealism is still alive  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>princess,<br>ahh, your soft-heart warms me, but no need to feel sorry for me. You're still young and idealistic, I hope you find someone like Bear.<br><br>bear,<br>why do I need to "look cool" for you or anyone on the forum?? besides, not a very good way to "look cool" right, going by the reactions so far? I'm simply stating an observation from colleagues, peers and past relationships. I've seen female colleagues being two-timed, and decieved by married men. I've seen male colleagues who openly bragged about mistresses in China, some even having a few mistresses in different countries. These are all well-educated people with good incomes.<br><br>I do not think women should lower themselves, but they should certainly not see life through rose-tinted glasses because it's them who will lose out. On the other hand, I've known some very faithful men whose girlfriends either cheated on them, or became restless.<br><br>Of course I've also seen some very loving couples, but these are a small minority. And there are a few cases where what I thought was a beautiful fairytale (sigh) turned out to have a crack within. Like a friend's aunt whose husband visited a prostitute when she was pregnant. She was devestated but they stayed together even though it took 2 long years for the emotional scars to fade.<br><br>These are all real experiences I know, sad but true.<br><br>Still, good for you if you're the faithful kind, I sincerely applaud you and wish you well.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>bear,<br><br>you made quite a number of assumptions in your post that I must refute<br><br>1. that life can only be fulfilling if one is attached. That is a fallacy.<br><br>2. that to acknowledge the high proportion of flawed and broken relationships is automatically a sign of cynicsm. We should call a spade a spade. Acknowledge the truth, THEN decide what you want. I don't discourage people from entering relationships. I do however stress that one must go in with eyes wide open.<br><br>3. that when one party "chooses love", the other party automatically does as well. Just take a good look around.<br><br>4. that a man who cheats is automatically a pig with no redeeming values. He could be a kind fella, with the fatal weakness for women. what about Mick Jagger? Bad partner but good father?<br><br>5. that a woman who decides to value her material wellbeing over love is automatically "lower than a sow." What about the poor university students who are part-time prostitutes to pay their school fees? What about those pretty PRC Chinese girls who rather be a mistress, build a house for their family, than slog in a factory for pittance and marrying a man who treat them as doormats and baby-making machines?<br><br>6. did I say you, the Bear, shouldn't seek joy and happiness with the one you decided to devote yourself to?? *scratch head*<br><br>7. that choosing love automatically brings happiness, and that a person who choose otherwise is "unwise." (related to 5.)What about people who really NEED money more than they need love? Or people who decides to focus on money FIRST before they seek love? Or the divorcee who decided that she/he has had enough of cheating spouses and will instead just focus on money to guarantee the well-being of dependents??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To gine:<br><br>Yes, sad but true. Most often, we tend to remember the bad incidents than the good ones. I have encountered incidents which you have described as a third party. I have also seen true love with my own eyes, not those on silverscreen.<br><br>The thing is that how you look at things. If you have started out thinking that all men are cheaters, then that's the way it will be for you. If you think that all women are sluts, then chances are it is for you. Perception plays an important aspects. Not that I'm saying you should think that person is good when he/she is really bad - that would be cheating yourself.<br><br>What I'm trying to say is that, there are good and bad people around and it will stay that way. Sometimes, I think it is very lucky that you meet someone whom you can trust and he/she is able to guarantee that trust.<br><br>Another thing that worries me is that, are you implying that you won't be faithful since your world is full of unfaithful people?</div>
