            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">by Pak Cham Kai</span><br><br>Minister of State for Affairs with Foreigners Mr. Hong Kan Seng says that in order to win more business from mainland China, CHEE-na Singaporeans must be BI-cultural, i.e. a Â“Chee-BiÂ” for short.<br><br><strong>Minister</strong>: ItÂ’s not enough to be bilingual anymore. We must be bi-cultural, otherwise weÂ’ll lose out to Americans or Europeans in winning mainland Chinese business.<br><br><strong>TalkingCock</strong>: But If Westerners are winning the game without having to adopt a culture different from their own, why should Singaporeans?<br><br><strong>Minister</strong>: The fact is, Chinese people are willing to suck up to ang mors because they all hope to get visas to resettle in the West. You think anyone in China except hard luck prostitutes want to relocate to Singapore? The fact is, they actually look down on overseas Chinese as inferior. So we have to be more like them so they wonÂ’t look down on us so much.<br><br><strong>TalkingCock</strong>: Chope, chope, chope. Let me get this straight, Minister. If weÂ’re to be more like them, are you saying we must now look down on our own culture in order to get more business?<br><br><strong>Minister</strong>: Well, I wouldnÂ’t put it like that.<br><br><strong>TalkingCock</strong>: But thatÂ’s what you mean.<br><br><strong>Minister</strong>: Come on, you must admit our local Chinese culture has grown quite different from mainland Chinese culture.<br><br><strong>TalkingCock</strong>: But we are a different country! With a different history! And a different population mix!<br><br><strong>Minister</strong>: WouldnÂ’t you want to restore our Chinese culture to a purer, more refined form?<br><br><strong>TalkingCock</strong>: IsnÂ’t the purity of a culture a subjective thing?<br><br><strong>Minister</strong>: Well, whether thatÂ’s subjective is itself subjective, and we believe that objectively, it isnÂ’t.<br><br><strong>TalkingCock</strong>: (pause as reporter untangles brain)<br><br><strong>Minister</strong>: Admit it, Singaporeans of Chinese descent canÂ’t rightly call themselves Chinese anymore. Nowadays weÂ’re only Â‘cheenaÂ’. ThatÂ’s why we have to be bi-cultural. Ergo, we must be Â‘chee-bisÂ’. Catchy catch-phrase, isnÂ’t it?<br><br><strong>TalkingCock</strong>: Yes, thereÂ’s lots of things one can catch from a Â‘chee-biÂ’.<br><br><strong>Minister</strong>: As part of the same initiative, weÂ’re also organizing networking lunch meetings for businesses who want to promote Singapore-China ties. WeÂ’re calling it Â“Lunch-QiaoÂ”, i.e. using lunch to build a bridge (or qiao, in Mandarin) to China. We hope it will improve our biculturalism.<br><br><strong>TalkingCock</strong>: So you want Singaporeans to go to a lunch qiao to learn how to become better chee-bis?<br><br><strong>Minister</strong>: Clever, isnÂ’t it?<br><br><strong>TalkingCock</strong>: With your push to make our local Chinese culture closer to that of the mainland, and the drive to wipe out Singlish, our homegrown English vernacular, in favour of the QueenÂ’s English, what do you think remains of local, indigenous Singaporean culture?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Minister</strong>: Well, we arenÂ’t advocating that the Malays or Indians become bi-cultural too.<br><br><strong>TalkingCock</strong>: But surely thatÂ’s only a matter of time before you do that, when their economies become more attractive to us.<br><br><strong>Minister</strong>: Look, weÂ’re confident that no matter what we do, Singaporeans will still hold on to their local culture and take it wherever they go. Why, just last month, I was in Perth and I met several quittÂ… I mean, former Singaporeans, and they still sounded really Singaporean, using Singlish and everything!<br><br><strong>TalkingCock</strong>: It doesnÂ’t occur to you that this might be because theyÂ’re beyond your jurisdiction and control?<br><br><strong>Minister</strong>: Well, I look at them as failed Singaporeans; those who couldnÂ’t make it in Singapore, so they had to go somewhere less dynamic. Come to think of it, their continuing to use Singlish and behave like regular Singaporeans probably has a correlation to their inability to succeed in Singapore.<br><br><strong>TalkingCock</strong>: In summary, then: Singaporean Chinese must shy away from our own indigenous Chinese culture to be more like mainlanders in order to attract their business. Meanwhile, all Singaporeans must shy away from our indigenous English vernacular and sound more like Americans and Europeans in order to attract their business. In other words, neither of the two cultures you want us to have is our own. But itÂ’s okay, because local Singapore culture will still thrive Â– because itÂ’s preserved by those quitting the country<br><br><strong>Minister</strong>: That sounds correct.<br><br><strong>TalkingCock</strong>: And you see noting wrong in telling people the only place you can find true Singapore culture is Perth?<br><br><strong>Minister</strong>: No. We believe to survive in todayÂ’s globalized economy, you have to send your homegrown stuff abroad, and invite the foreign stuff home.<br><br><strong>TalkingCock</strong>: I can see why your concept of biculturalism produces Â‘chee-bisÂ’.<br><br><strong>Minister</strong>: Thank you.<br><br><strong>TalkingCock</strong>: And you are a stellar example of a chee-bi.<br><br><strong>Minister</strong>: YouÂ’re too kind.<br><br><strong>TalkingCock</strong>: And since weÂ’re in Singapore, according to your logic, I have to sound more European, so allow me to bid you an Italian farewell.<br><br><strong>Minister</strong>: Go ahead.<br><br><strong>TalkingCock</strong>: Ciao, chee-bi!<br><br>from <a href="http://www.talkingcock.com" rel="nofollow">www.talkingcock.com</a></div>
