              <p>I am not doing my A levels, and i'm simply stating a fact given that the comparison predicates on academia. While I concede that polytechnics have improved, the whole idea of high flying poly students being newsworthy material shows that the phenomenon is still extraordinary. You don't see the straits times telling you how many RJ students make it to the ivy league every year, because its so common and expected that no one even cares.</p>

              <p>I read in Straits Time that of the cohorts of student entering poly.. 25% could have made it to JC if they had wanted. This means 75% of poly students got L1R5 of 20 and above.</p>
              <p>I hate to say this but doesn't it mean that majority of students in poly are less capable (in terms of academic performance) then Jc peers. A large group of them can't make it to Jc. The majority of the better performing students are in Jcs. This translates into stiffer competition for Jc kids. If the government increases poly intake into uni this only means that some of the more capable JCs kids would be denied a chance in local uni. That isn't fair to them. If the govt decides to increase % of poly students admitted into uni due to pressure then I'll view it as similar to the new economic policy in malaysia.</p>
              <p>The weaker community is given additional help for them to succeed in life at the expense of stronger community. You can see the repercussions in malaysia today. The better performing indians and chineses chose to leave.

              <p>Some of you might have argued that Jc students are only book smart while poly students are better in hands on stuffs. How do you all know that Jc kids can't do better than the poly guys if they had decided to join polytechnics. Remember, JC students had a choice while majority (75%) of poly students don't. In fact, i believe that if the Jc system was to be scraped and replaced with polytechnics. The same group of people (those in elite Jcs) are gonna to top in poly as well.</p>
              <p>Let's face it. Many poly students chose poly for they felt that they have problems with english and are fearful of GP.

              <p>Good job well done, you've done extremely well in turning this whole issue and changing the context.</p>
              <p>Might I remind you that this issue isn't about Poly students asking for more spots in University but rather, some guy who suggested that Poly should not be given spots in University.</p>
              <p>So because some the JC students aren't performing in their A Levels, suddenly poly students are at fault even though we only take up 20% of the yearly intake? Isn't this society about meritocracy? Don't we always talk about equal rights and chances? No one forbided you to select the poly route when you have the chance, neither did another stop you from going JC. Who are you to decide that Poly students should just stop at Polytechnic?</p>
              <p>If you're a JC student, I'm utterly disappointed as to what kind of education JC is giving you. I can't even start on your stupidity, actually if I were you, I would not even reply to this.</p>

              <p>This is what I've observed in my workplace.</p>
              <p>About 60% of the JC guys I've seen cannot follow simple instructions given to them, such as: "Go to ______, outside make a right turn." Instead, they always make a left turn, even though instructions are given to them 5 minutes ago.</p>
              <p>And I've seen a JC guy even more powerful. There are CLEAR instructions on the turnstile that the entrance is specially for pass holders (security card). And yet he forcibly turn the turnstile, making a din "How do I get through here?"</p>
              <p>Sometimes I wonder, do they study to the extent that they are not street-smart, or simply, no common sense? If that's the case, how are they going to survive in this world?</p>

              <p>"Let's face it. Many poly students chose poly for they
                                      felt that they have problems with english and 
              are fearful of GP. It

                                      shelter with less capable people, what gave them
               the right to
                                      ask for more uni places at the expense of the 
              more capable
                                      ones in JCs?"</p>
              <p>Well, let me tell you this. Most of the polytechnic entrants are around 16-17 years old. As this age, they have seen the value of the polytechnic diplomas when they graduated; more working experiences, being a professional in specialising in certain areas, higher pay than their A level counterparts when they graduate. And more importantly, they are mature enough to make decisions relating to their future because it is a 3 year specialising course. As for those entering JC, they are simply a bunch of people who wish to buy time during these 2 years because they simply cannot decide for their future at this age, and they need someone to depend on (parents helping them to decide on JC route).</p>
              <p>If I am a boss, frankly speaking I would hire someone with a polytechnic diploma cause he has the relevant skills and working experiences prior to entering my company. Thus, less time is spent on teaching him or her all the basics, and this valuable time can be used for something else (cost-savings).</p>
              <p>This is Singapore. The system is shaped from long long time ago so people will naturally think that JC is a "superior system" to enter university. Don't forget, in other parts of the world. Having a diploma is like having a degree where it is highly sought upon, cause the population value the practicability aspect of that diploma and how it can improve the economy.</p>

              <p>Wow. Reading this part of your post was such an eye-opener. 20 pointers go to JC because they have nowhere else to go apart from ITE? What a joke. Their 20 points are calculated based on their L1R5. If you apply for a poly course, it's your L1R4 that's taken into consideration. So I daresay that many of those 20 pointers who went to JC could easily have made it into quite a number of the poly courses available.</p>
              <p>"8 pointers are snatching up the poly places".</p>
              <p>While I don't deny this, 8 pointers are hardly considered the cream of the crop in the first place! And this has been the case ever since the introduction of the Integrated Programme.</p>
              <p>"Do you know that Cut off point (COP) for almost all courses in polytechnics are below 15 these days? Certainly not for a lot of people.... I got a shock when I saw my youngest brother's COP booklet, where my time it was like 20."</p>
              <p>Like I said earlier, my dear, it's the L1R4 that's taken into consideration when you apply for a poly course, while it's the L1R5 that's taken into consideration when you apply for JC. Many people make the mistake of comparing the cut-off points of JCs and polys directly, and you're no exception.</p>
              <p>"But think about it, Jc students do play a lot too much when they are in J1.... and ended up staying back already in JC and there are lots of them who have been getting too much involved with their CCAs, that they have forgotten about their academics.<br><br>Many are also being "forced" by their parents to go there... and seriously could not cope with their studies.... They are just trying their best to remain their mentality that they are more "superior"....<br><br>If you are lazy, why should the local universities enrol you into their schools?<br>Meritocracy - Think about it.<br><br>Seriously, that is just being a "loser" to suggest and demand a place when your results are inferior."</p>
              <p>You're over-generalising. It's as simple as that. The JC curriculum is a challenging and demanding one and many people work hard to cope with its demands. What's with the insinuation that people in JC are lazy? In case you're wondering, Bs and Cs in the A-levels are unlikely to get you a place in the local universities anymore.</p>
              <p>So wake up and smell the coffee! Stop living in your own world where you think that "so-and-so is inferior, blah-blah-blah is better"! If you haven't realised by now, I didn't make any digs at poly students and only stated the plain facts, while you had to resort to making baseless accusations against JC students. I can't stop you from making your own opinions known, but it would really be good if you could be more careful with the things you say.</p>
              <p>For the record, I'll be moving on to JC next year, so you are free to think that I might be biased in my evaluation of the issue.</p>

              <p>Good job well done, you've done extremely well in turning this whole issue and changing the context.</p>
              <p>Might I remind you that this issue isn't about Poly students asking for more spots in University but rather, some guy who suggested that Poly should not be given spots in University.</p>
              <p>So because some the JC students aren't performing in their A Levels, suddenly poly students are at fault even though we only take up 20% of the yearly intake? Isn't this society about meritocracy? Don't we always talk about equal rights and chances? No one forbided you to select the poly route when you have the chance, neither did another stop you from going JC. Who are you to decide that Poly students should just stop at Polytechnic?</p>
              <p>If you're a JC student, I'm utterly disappointed as to what kind of education JC is giving you. I can't even start on your stupidity, actually if I were you, I would not even reply to this.</p>

He merely said that JC students deserves priority in going to local university. Does this equates to saying polytechnic students should not be given any places? To make things easier for you to understand. Let me quote some of the stuffs he wrote..</p>

              <p>Agenda, tell me when did he ever say that poly students should not be getting any places in local uni?</p>
              <p>In fact,the main point of his article is that JC students should deserve more priority and poly students should not persistently demand for an increase in % of uni places allocated to them. This is the point which I have tried to address in my previous reply. In what way have I turned the whole issue and change the context as you have so confidently claimed in your post. I would love to hear your argument. That is if you can provide one =D</p>
              <p><strong>If you're a JC student, I'm utterly disappointed as to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">what kind of education JC is giving you</span>. I can't even start on your stupidity, actually if I were you, I would not even reply to this. (By agenda)</strong></p>
              <p>Haha. Why are you bashing the JC education system now? Are you trying to draw me into a mudslingering against the Poly education system? Sorry. You are not going to succeed. I would love to find the reason for your disdain towards the JC education. I seriously hope it's not inferiority complex at work again!!!</p>
              <p>Anyway,you mentioned about equality and meritocracy. These ideas can only work if everybody is competing on equal grounds. Don't bring out these terms and use them indiscriminately when you did not even use your smart brain to think whether they are applicable in the first place.</p>
              <p>Let me give you a simple analogy. Two students were the top students from their respective schools. One from RI or HCI while the other guy was from YJC. The top student from RI/HCI was given prestigious scholarship but not the top student from YJC. The YJC student then decided to bring out the lofty idea of equality and meritocracy (just like you Agenda)  and demanding his rights to the prestigious scholarships because he's also a top student too, albeit from YJC.</p>
              <p>Now Agenda, was there any proper basis for EQUAL comparison in the first place? Did the YJC students compete on equal grounds with the RI/HCI students? Unless you can tell me the RI/HCI/YJC students are of the same calibre...</p>
              <p>Just to find out more. Agenda, you were a poly students right? Did you manage to get the 'precious' slot in our fantastic local unis? If you have succeeded would you mind sharing the course you got? I really love to see more poly students in the law/medicine/dental faculty.

              <p>I as a poly student read liao also dulan. My L1R5 less than 16 also go poly. No point writing an article asking us to reflect on our own choices. I'm not viewing diploma as my final destination.</p>
              <p><em>"Polytechnic graduates cannot have it both ways. They must know the

              <p>Poly students also pay more for sch fees and we spend 3 years in education. Even transport fees are against us. I just hope for an increase in allocation % into uni and not exactly the same priority.</p>

              <p>Well, let's see</p>
              <p><em>Nothing should stop them from pursuing their dream overseas, but they cannot expect greater access to local universities just because it is costlier to study abroad. <strong>by LBT</strong></em></p>
              <p>Okay, let's first highlight some things</p>
              <p><strong>1)</strong> A Levels is only seen on same level as Diploma in SG &amp; SEA, basically out of SEA, this cert is almost worthless in the real world industry.<br><strong>2)</strong> Poly students must at least achieve 3.5 <strong>Cumulative Grade Point Average</strong> to "guarantee" a spot in a local Uni, this 3.5 must be maintained throughout 3 years - 6 semesters.<br><strong>3)</strong> Why should Poly grads be the ones to go overseas?</p>
              <p>First point, do you realise that A levels is practically a worthless certificate out of SEA and the commonwealth nations? Even in SG, do you expect to be paid the same as a Diploma Holder for the same job or even more? Diploma is a professional certificate, why should the unis NOT allocate more slots for holders of a professional certificate over students with qualifying certificate? This brings us to the 2nd point.</p>
              <p>Do you realise for poly students, we must maintain our results for 3 years? How does that make us "less capable students" if we can constantly maintain our cGPA over 3 years when JC students basically just take some combined examination in 1 go and they can always retake if they fail. Mind you, there is no such thing as "retake" in poly, if you fail a subject, having a D will just bring your cGPA down to 3.0 which immediately disqualify you from local uni. I don't see how a student who has to maintain good result for 6 semesters is less capable and is taking the easy way out.</p>
              <p>Last point, Why should poly graduates be expected to go overseas so that their JC counterparts can have more slots in a local uni? Yes, government gave us a lot of subsidies for Poly education, but can JC students choose to have taken this?</p>
              <p><em>Let's face it. Many poly students chose poly for they felt that they have <strong>problems with english and are fearful of GP</strong>. It gave the impression that poly is a 'shelter' for them to hide from the stiff competition in Jc.

              <p>Firstly, how do you know many poly students took your so called "sheltered path" because of english and gp? I have many friends in poly who took GP and they scored A.</p>
              <p>Less capable people, hmm, I won't accuse of elitism but read my above points.</p>
              <p>Does being in JC automatically = more capable than poly students? Mind you, there is no limit in the As, Bs &amp; Cs that can be given in poly. They don't have a quota to meet, so the students have to earn it themselves and cannot do 80% and hope their coursemates do not thus automatically granting them an A.</p>
              <p>Plus my above point about poly students having to maintain results for 6 semesters.</p>
              <p><em>Now Agenda, was there any proper basis for EQUAL comparison in the first place? Did the YJC students compete on equal grounds with the RI/HCI students? Unless you can tell me the RI/HCI/YJC students are of the same calibre...</em></p>
              <p>This is basically because, it's the mindset set in that RJC is better than YJC. But between JC and Poly. That's a whole different story.</p>
              <p>Yes, JC students scored better in O Levels, but ever heard of the term "late bloomers"? And just because you are better in studying academic subjects doesn't mean that you will automatically function properly in the real world.</p>
              <p>Plus, JC is considered Secondary while Poly is Tertiary. It's totally different from secondary school and is a step up. Include my previous points, tell me, who is competing on shaky grounds between JC and Poly students. And considering the fact that, poly students only get about 15% to 20% slots in local uni despite having more students. I don't see it being too much to ask for more slots.</p>
              <p>Let's say you have a Poly student whose cGPA is 3.60 and a JC student who got DDD/B. Who would you choose? A student who has consistently scored As &amp; B+ or a student who scored Ds in 1 go.</p>

              <p>Good call multipleviews, let me just hammer this freaking nail deeper into the coffin that is the ultimately futile vendetta that some disillusioned poly kids have against a clearly superior JC system in a meritocratic context.</p>
              <p>I'd safely say that 99% of Singapore's politicians, doctors, lawyers, bankers and captains of industry are JC graduates. So the rest can just shut up about their precious poly certs. The only poly kids who really succeed are the top 5% of their cohorts or lucky punks who set up ridiculously successful bubble tea shops and fish farms. So to whoever: better go start honing your fish handling skills now =)</p>
              <p>Oh and for those who say that poly certs are more valuable than A level certs, walk down to any secondary school and ask a random sample size of kids whether they'd like a 3.5GPA or 5 'A' Level distinctions more. And then shut the hell up</p>
