              <p>Woah! Chill guys. No point getting so fired up over this.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, I personally feel that the Poly students deserve more places than what is currently being allocated in the local universities. If they got a good enough GPA, I don't see why they don't deserve the right to enter the university! And this is coming from a JC student who didn't do well for his A levels. Similarly for the JC students, the universities should keep the numbers entering constant. I don't want to go into the part of foreign talents because that would spark off another huge debate. But by increasing spaces for both the Poly &amp; JC students, everyone would be happy as more people from either Poly of JC can enter our local universities!</p>
              <p>But that is easier said than done! Because the unis would have to factor in the larger influx of students and cater to all of them with their present resources and the appropriate scheduling and planning of timetables. But ultimately, it points down to whether the uni has more professors, more rooms, more equipment, etc.</p>
              <p>As to which side has obtained the better skills or better knowledge in their respective institutions, my observations come from my poly friends all struggling with the engineering modules because their foundations in Math is not that desirable. As for the JC people, we suck at the lab portions because the poly people have done it before and are more hands-on back then when they were earning their diploma. I can't tell about the other students in business, science, law, etc faculties because I'm not in them. But there are certain trade-offs to the different paths you have taken. Different ways of obtaining skills, different techniques of acquiring knowledge. But one thing is certain. When you go out to the working world, what you learnt will either be forgotten or will not be applicable. But that is another story altogether...</p>

              <p>For one, ALL JC peeps have a choice to choose b/w Poly and JC, and you chose JC. If you flunk your A's, you can only blame yourself for not working hard and dont accuse the Poly students who performed better in the GPA to "steal" your seat in Uni.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I think every Singaporean deserves an equal chance to receive a university education. We should not be asking whether priority should be given JC or Poly students. Like what eagle has said, we can not compare an apple against an orange. I think the only question is this: how many foreign student do we want to take in to our university. Inviting foreigners here to study no doubt create a competitive edge in our education system.. NUS is able to achieve a decent ranking among other university in the world because of the proportion of foreign students from a diversified range of countries. However, Increasing the competitiveness is one thing, and providing to our very own youth is another. Our government speak of building more university in the hope that more of our youth is able to obtain at least a degree qualification, except that is not entirely true. As the number of students that NUS, NTU and SMU take in increase over the years, so does the number of foreign student, and I personally believe the latter has increased greater in proportion - that is depriving some of us from our admission to local university. If your parents are wealthy they may send you abroad, but what if they can not afford?</p></div>

              <p>Did you even study in NUS or NTU before? I guess not. The failure rates are not high if you put in the effort. And if an overseas degree is so much easier to get, I see no point in going to that uni to study. It defeats the purpose and challenge of true education. Taking the easy way out is not an option.</p>
              <p>And if it's that easy to get a overseas degree, what's the point when many others will get the same as you? There wouldn't be any distinction between different people otherwise.</p>

              <p>Yes I have no choice but to study there. I qualified for Cornell, but my family finances were insufficient for me to study there.

              <p>I dunno about the students there, but I found it rather easy to secure my first class honours from NUS, on top of 2 awards for my final year project <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
