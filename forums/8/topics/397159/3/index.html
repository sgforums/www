              <p>no, no, youre not getting my point. let me put it simply. If I ask you now, what are the odds that you'll be earning 50K a month in 20 years time, you probably wont be sure right? But ask that to someone who's training to be a brain surgeon in medical school, and he'll probably be quite sure. </p>

              <p>Erm chill guys...</p>
              <p>Currently, I feel that the quota for uni entry for poly students is a little low and should be raised.</p>
              <p>However, that does not devalue the standard of an A level education. The issue here is not that poly students with a GPA of less than 3.5 are completely unable to get into local universities. Actually the cut of point for courses in NIE and certain engineering and science courses in NTU is around 3.1-3.2, which is achievable by an average poly student. It's that these poly students with average GPAs are trying to get into courses like business and chemical engineering, which require an A level grade of AAA/A( chemical engineering) or AAB/B(business). Of course, there will be no shortage of qualified A level applicants there and poly students have to prove themselves to be outstanding in order to get in. Which the A level students have already done by getting outstanding A level results that would actually qualify them to enter most UK universities.</p>

              should know why. Just look at all your rubbish replies and
              thoughts. Compare it to ppl like hoto and HyperionDCZ.. It's
              painfully obvious right? LOL. So, who can you look down on? That's
              pretty obvious. Look down on the other 85% of the losers from
              polytechnic la. Like people such as TTFU. You must be very happy to
              see his post asking abt private degree right? HAHA.</p>
              <p>So you can use this failure in life to boost your own self
              esteem =D</p>

              <p><br>dun ask so much la. i hate to say this but just to let you know that a degree from a pte school is worthless and no point getting la. the 3 unis are churning out so many graduates evey year. they are facing problems getting job. why would employer hire someone with a degree from a pte school? Ppl from local uni will just be a farmer who works long hour with little pay. What abt ppl with a not so recognised degree like a pte school? A cow? Just there to help farmer with the ploughing of land? Lol. Actually this is what I observed for many with only a diploma. They are subordinates to some exploited and lowly paid local Uni graduates (a farmer). What does this says abt the poly graduates? A cow right? haha. Just a tool in the farming process... </p>

              <p><br>As the TS of this thread, it is sad that a constructive discussion has turned into a ugly battle between Jc and Poly Students. haiz. This is not what I hope to see when I started the thread.</p>
              <p>To be objective, quoting gigabyte14, a particular idiot has gone and touch on the sensitive topic. This discussion should be about uni admission.  But somebody had to post imflammatory remarks that caused so much scoldings in this discussion. The trigerring statement made by the particular idiot.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>No matter how I look at it, the poly student is still the star here.. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>and about A level certs being worthless..</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">This statement started the quarrel. Haiz. Hope people like this would not come again and derail the course of discussion. The only aim of this people is to drive the thread off track... If individual TS can decides on the post that are allowed to be made in the thread, I would have removed all the posts made by this person...</span></p>

              <p>lol. maybe instead of wasting time here you can sign up as a private A level candidate. prey that u can get a place in the local uni tat ur peer agenda values so much.lol.</p>
              <p>actually cant blame u all la.</p>
              <p>students from elite jcs view local uni as dumping ground for their less capable peers and also for the students from non-elite jcs. ppl from non-elite (the middle ranking) jcs find it a breeze and a norm to enter local unis. while ppl from the lower ranking jcs will heave a sigh of relief as long as they can step into local uni.</p>
              <p>but for poly students, they would behave as though as they have struck lottery if they were to make it into local uni. i am not talking about popular courses like medicine or dentistry, but maybe some courses meant for jc students with CCCC grades in a levels.. like some engineering courses or media design. lol.</p>
              <p>Isn't it obvious which education system is better now?</p>
              <p>You poly graduates kept talking abt ur technical and hands on work experience as an advantage to jc peeps. but anybody who have done management science during their undergraduates time (or at higher level) would have told u tat in any organisation.. the leader (jc kids) is the one with the necessary management skill... they are in charge of critical issues like manpower allocation (ensuring poly students are allocated to jobs that best match their specialties) and planning for the company's future. Who'll be the ppl doing the ground work? It's those with the technical skills.They will take instructions from the leaders and specialise in the area that the leaders assigned them. This is the primary reason why govt set up institutions like ITE (institute of TECHNICAL education) and polyTECHNIC. Observe tat majority of the secondary school leavers will head to these 2 institutions. The reason is clear. You need more ppl at the ground levels than at the management levels. The technical education provided at poly and ite is to gear the graduates for ground level work..</p>
              <p>While for JC kids, they are commonly divided into 3 different levels. Top Jc students would most like be in the top management levels. like the ministers, perm secs and military chiefs we see. Middle ranking jc will be in the middle management levels like manager of a dept, supervisor etc. Of course, some from bottom jcs will be in the lowest management level or would join their poly/ite counterparts in doing the ground work.</p>
              <p>It's a cruel fact in singapore tat everything is planned based on one's paper qualification. Of cours, not all is able to accept the fact. Some stubborn ass like Agenda would continue to insist on the merits of his diploma. LOL. </p>
