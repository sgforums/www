              <p>Such a simple logic also, want to argue for fcuk?</p>
              <p>Lemme just say this: <em>ceteris paribus</em>, I would far rather let in a talented poly student than to reserve a place for a mediocre JC student who messed up his A Levels. I don't see what the problem with admitting poly students is provided they meet the standards.</p>
              <p>So long as you work hard and do well for your A Levels, then there should be no issue at all about entering uni. If you screw up your A Levels and lost your place to some poly dude who did better than you, then it's entirely your own fault. Simple, right?</p>
              <p>And before anyone throws profanities or make any assumptions about me, let me just say that I was a JC fella whose father is a taxi driver, and whose mother is a housewife. So don't give me any bullsh*t about me being an elitist prick or anything like that, okay?</p>

              <p>lol. maybe instead of wasting time here you can sign up as
              a private A level candidate. prey that u can get a place
              in the local uni tat ur peer agenda values so much.lol.</p>
              <p>actually cant blame u all la.</p>
              <p>students from elite jcs view local uni as dumping ground
              for their less capable peers and also for the students
              from non-elite jcs. ppl from non-elite (the middle
              ranking) jcs find it a breeze and a norm to enter local unis.
              while ppl from the lower ranking jcs will heave a sigh of relief as
              long as they can step into local uni.</p>
              <p>but for poly students, they would behave as though as they have
              struck lottery if they were to make it into local uni. i am not
              talking about popular courses like medicine or dentistry, but maybe
              some courses meant for jc students with CCCC grades in a levels..
              like some engineering courses or media design. lol.</p>
              <p>Isn't it obvious which education system is better now?</p>
              <p>You poly graduates kept talking abt ur technical and hands on
              work experience as an advantage to jc peeps. but anybody who have
              done management science during their undergraduates time (or
              at higher level) would have told u tat in any organisation.. the
              leader (jc kids) is the one with the necessary management
              skill... they are in charge of critical issues like manpower
              allocation (ensuring poly students are allocated to jobs that best
              match their specialties) and planning for the company's
              future. Who'll be the ppl doing the ground work? It's those with
              the technical skills.They will take instructions from the leaders
              and specialise in the area that the leaders assigned them. This
              is the primary reason why govt set up institutions
              like ITE (institute of TECHNICAL education) and polyTECHNIC.
              Observe tat majority of the secondary school leavers will head to
              these 2 institutions. The reason is clear. You need more ppl
              at the ground levels than at the management levels. The
              technical education provided at poly and ite is to gear the
              graduates for ground level work..</p>
              <p>While for JC kids, they are commonly divided into 3 different
              levels. Top Jc students would most like be in the top management
              levels. like the ministers, perm secs and military chiefs we see.
              Middle ranking jc will be in the middle management levels like
              manager of a dept, supervisor etc. Of course, some from bottom jcs
              will be in the lowest management level or would join their poly/ite
              counterparts in doing the ground work.</p>
              <p>It's a cruel fact in singapore tat everything is planned based
              on one's paper qualification. Of cours, not all is able to accept
              the fact. Some stubborn ass like Agenda would continue to
              insist on the merits of his diploma. LOL. </p>

              <p>I don't really understand your point here...</p>
              <p>For your information, around 70%-80% of A Level top scorers stay in local universities pursuing courses like business, engineering, medicine and law.</p>
              <p>It's actually easier for a A level holder with mediocre grades (read= not perfect) to get into courses in UK/US as compared to local. The students that are studying overseas are actually mostly those that are able to afford it, or willing to sign a super long bond for a scholarship.</p>
              <p>Please do some research before speaking...</p>

              <p>Actually to be fair, both courses of action have their own merits.</p>
              <p>I can't comment on poly... but for JC students (and in uni as well), it's not about what subjects you study that matters. On top of subject matter, one needs to learn to handle 'extreme' stress, manage time, meet seemingly impossible deadlines, take charge of projects, manage pple in CCAs and classes, while still staying optimistic and focussed on the ultimate goal (of A levels) throughout. I believe poly studies won't be much different. All these are lessons and skills in life that we should train ourselves in.</p>
              <p>Education is a holistic approach; and we should all look at it from a holistic viewpoint... If society needs someone who can only study well and regurgitate from the textbook, then might as well get a dictionary or computer. If society needs someone who can do hands-on very well, they might as well import cheaper workers from neighbouring countries.</p>

              consistently scored As &amp; B+ or a student who scored Ds in 1

              <p>3.60 gpa is considered above average for a poly student. and it is definitely not comparable to a DDD/B jc student. very unfair comparison you have here.DDD/B will not get anyone into any uni. Do you really think that JC students have a "guranteed" place in local uni? hell no.</p>
              <p>lets not be delusional. we all know that although poly students have to put in consistent effort throughout 3 years to get a gpa of above 3.5, we all know that the tests, (technical knowledge aside), are of a lower difficulty level than the JC test papers. Just compare a poly math paper alongside a JC math paper, and it will be obvious.</p>
              <p>the theoretical depth of poly syllabus is also not as deep as the A level syllabus.</p>
              <p>for most courses, entry requirements for local uni are higher than that of top uk uni such as imperial, oxbridge.</p>
              <p>to quote a real-life example. my friend was offered a place in Cambridge (BSc. Chemistry) provided that he gets AAB for A levels. they only require 3 subjects for consideration, and does not even require straight As.</p>
              <p>in the end he chose to study in singapore, because he is unable to secure a scholarship, and thus can't afford the cost of oversea degree. BTW, he is a straight A student, with AAA/B.</p>
              <p>also, as we can all see from figures released by the 3 unis, the top popular courses all demand a minimum of straight As.</p>
              <p>medicine and law aside, even for more "mainstream" courses like chemical engineering, pharmacy, the minimum grades are AAA/A.</p>
              <p>and does agenda really think it is so easy to score straight As without consistent hardwork, despite the A levels being an one-off exam?</p>
              <p>CCC/C is the bare minimum for uni, and will only qualify a student for the "dumping grounds" of any local uni.</p>
              <p>the road to uni for jc grads is not as even as you think it is.</p>

              <p>"To JC students, university is and has always been their final destination. To poly students, their end point, in Singapore at least, should be their diploma."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How can he say that! Everyone in the<em> right mind</em> will know that there are a lot of polytechnic students who wish to further study after getting their diploma. Doesn't mean that just because some people want to get a diploma only mean every polytechnic students have this kind of mindset too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And he continued saying that people who really want to get a degree should go to JC. He himself mentioned earlier that polytechnic students recieve more hands-on training.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just because people choose to recieve more hands-on....it might be because people prefer doing that more. How can he say that this category of students should have lesser opportunity for university education? Mad man.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>In my opinion, JC students should be given priority over poly students since they were already differentiated from the rest during the O level exams as most people with a good L1R5 score would choose JC because it is a more guaranteed route to university, unless their aim is not entering university. JC students are taking a much bigger risk than poly students. If JC students fail to enter university, they do not have a diploma to fall back on. And yes, there should be meritocracy as most of you say. Most polytechnic students have not achieved an L1R5 deemed good enough to enter a JC, but everyone from JC can opt to enter a polytechnic.</div>

              <p>lol...  this topic is still so active among students...</p>
              <p>in my opinion...JC is a place where those doctors,lawyer, psychiatrist ect study because poly dosent really have the str8 course except psychology .</p>
              <p>at the same time..if JC's wanted go go for banker or business after the A level thats really a moron and "Gong c'b " to complain that "the poly F**kers stole my place".use your brain and think..if you want to do that after your A's go for private if you dont get a place and dont complain..^^ </p>
              <p>CONCLUSION: dont WHINE if you choose to take up the courses that poly offers AND choose those course(doctors , lawyer ect.) that poly does' nt offers so that people dun snatch your place in uni^^</p>

              <p>JC is not a more guranteed route to poly. it is the tried and tested route. don't choose JC just because more people from JC go to uni as compared to poly.</p>
              <p>and honestly who does not want to enter uni if he/she plans to move up in their career.</p>
              <p>JC students choose to take the risk because again it is the tried and tested route. statistics show that more people from JC go to uni as compared to poly. but is it a guranteed path? no. JC students merely believe that going to JC will provide a higher chance of going uni but who is to say that if they were to rest on their 'laurels'.</p>
              <p>Again most polytechnic students. if we were to compare two 6 pointers for Os, one going poly and the other JC and only one person can enter the uni, can you rightfully say that the JC student should go if both were to achieve similar standings comparing GPA and A level results?</p>
