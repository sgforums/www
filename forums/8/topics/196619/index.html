            <div class='col-md body'>Article on CNA. Thought the article was interesting enough, what was somewhat glaring was the line that states that Japanese Toilet Cleaners are earning 3-4 times more than their Singapore Counterparts, whose pay are between $600-$800. Taking the tip of both scales, the highest paid japanese toilet cleaner would be a whopping $2400.<br><br>Other interesting facts would be of course, training would be conducted at Singapore Poly - your premium poly for Business, Info Tech and Toilet Cleaniness.<br><br>---------------------------------------<br><br>Singapore Toilet Record:<br><br>Sg Toilet/Pee Track Record<br>- Clean Toilet Campaign<br>- NeWater<br>- Professor Chew S**t Fun<br>- Golden Taps<br>- Pee to generate power by local scientists<br>- Toilet College<br>- Professional Toilet Cleaners<br><br>------------------------------------------<br><br>SINGAPORE: Singapore's toilet cleanliness is lagging behind Japanese standards by 15 years, and the Singapore Restroom Association, Workforce Development Agency and National Trades Union Congress hopes to change that by getting toilet cleaners to go professional.<br><br>Cleaners must identify urine crystals hidden in hard to reach places and learn how to get rid of it using different chemicals and equipment.<br><br>Cleaners must also study the different toilet bowl designs as bacteria are trapped in different places for different structures.<br><br>These are just some of the things that these 50 cleaners will be learning in Singapore's first Restroom Cleaning and Maintenance course which costs about $100,000 to organize.<br><br>"Most Singaporeans look down on cleaners, but I think after I attend this course, I will appreciate myself and will be proud a cleaner," said Shanti Chethi, a Restroom Specialist.<br><br>More courses like this will be conducted at the Singapore Polytechnic, and the aim is to eventually train 5,000 of the 22,000 toilet cleaners in Singapore.<br><br>"We want to raise the standards of cleanliness in toilets for our users. The side benefit is that we can also raise the professional standard of the workers so that they can earn more and have a meaningful job they can be proud of," said Zee Yoong Kang, Director of Job Re-creation Department, National Trades Union Congress.<br><br>Toilet cleaners currently make about $600 to $800 a month. That's 3 to 4 times less than their Japanese counterparts.<br><br>It is hoped that with the job creation programme, they can make about $950 a month.<br><br>Though no employer has committed to raising the salary of these Restroom Specialists, the programme's organizers are hopeful it will happen.<br><br>They say it is because restroom specialists are plumbers, toilet maintenance technicians and supervisors all at once, but they also add that demand for these specialists is necessary to drive wages up.<br><br>"Currently, the public does not like the state of toilets that they have, but they are not vocal. In the future, we need to be like the Japanese, who's demand for toilet cleanliness is very, very high. The increase in demand will drive the owner of the building to put their act together, and then these cleaners are there to fit the demand," said Jack Sim, founder of the Singapore Restroom Association, World Toilet College.<br><br>The Restroom Association also hopes to work with architects to design more ergonomic toilets. - CNA /dt<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think training the cleaners is not enough. Look at other countries such as Thailand or Taiwan, their toilets are far more cleaner than ours. I think educating our people on how to use toilet properly should be in place at the same time. Afterall, we all want a better environment.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That was an interesting news clip.  So, the students in the class would get a certificate/diploma/degree in Toilet Bowl Cleaning? Wow...that's a first.  Either the students really do have a burning desire to learn to scrub, or they're incredibly bored with their lives.<br><br>But, I guess as long as there's shit, there's going to be the market for these classes.

            <div class='col-md body'>well. most of the cleaners had little or no education background at all. so giving them a chance to better themselves is indeed a good start. with that cert/training, they would be able to command higher $$ and even become a supervisior. also giving a person who had little edu a chance at school again can boost their esteem.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>More toilet news. They got a 'native' toilet cleaner to come and give a brief on toilet cleaniness. The guy must be the one who earned $2400 one. One thing strikes out.. didn't know that we can gana fine $30 if we don't flush.<br><br>----------------------------------------------<br>Japan's toilet ambassadors help Singapore scrub up<br>--------------------------------------------<br><br>SINGAPORE : The classroom erupted in delighted cheers at the teacher's vigorous thrusts into a toilet bowl.<br><br>The plunger-wielding "professor" from Japan, Atsuhiro Katsumata, was in Singapore to help the city-state's toilet cleaners brush up their skills.<br><br>Despite its reputation as one of Asia's cleanest cities, Singapore, it seems, has yet to take its seat among the ranks of those with the most sparkling urinals.<br><br>Enter Katsumata, 44, who gave a class of 51 local cleaners tips on dealing with choked toilet bowls.<br><br>The recent four-day seminar organised by the World Toilet College (WTC) aimed to pass along advanced scrubbing and other skills to boost productivity and improve morale of Singaporean toilet cleaners, WTC founder Jack Sim told<br>AFP.<br><br>WTC is the educational arm of the Singapore-based World Toilet Organisation, which Sim said has members from 40 countries, and organises the World Toilet Summit which will be held this year in Moscow in September.<br><br>"Japan is famous for its clean toilets and their culture demands clean toilets," Sim said.<br><br>Saiko Sakamoto, an expert on toilet aesthetics who is part of Katsumata's clean-up crew, said toilets reflect a person's grooming.<br><br>"If the toilets are clean, people's manners will improve," she said.<br><br>While some Singapore loos pass muster, other public washrooms "look very dirty," she said.<br><br>"In shopping centers and hotel toilets, the styling is very attractive," Sakamoto said.<br><br>Japan needed 15 years for its toilets to shine and Singapore's toilets will require five to seven years of work before reaching that standard, she said.<br><br>Katsumata, who has organised similar seminars in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Malaysia, urged toilet cleaners to uphold Singapore's squeaky-clean reputation.<br><br>"Tourists who visit Singapore have the impression that Singapore is very beautiful and clean, so don't disappoint them," he said through a translator.<br><br>Singapore imposes a 30 Singapore dollar fine (18 US) on those who fail to flush public toilets.<br><br>"We are a rich country and we have everything. Our image is that of a clean and green city. We can't have dirty toilets," Sim said.<br><br>The pilot course was funded by Singapore's trade union and the skills-development agency. Sim hopes that with funding, the course will be converted into a 64-hour training programme by October.<br><br>"Once we professionalise the job of the toilet cleaners, they will take pride in their job and their salaries will increase, so everybody wins: the cleaner, the user and the owner of the building," Sim said.<br><br>The course has left Santhi Cheti, a toilet cleaner for the past decade, feeling flush with success.<br><br>"Now I take home 750 dollars but (after the course) I can take home 900-950 dollars because now I know how to do some repairing," Cheti said of her monthly salary.<br><br>"I'm very happy because I learnt a lot."<br><br>The curriculum taught by Katsumata and his two Japanese assistants includes a history of toilets, and how to dismantle urinals. They even learn to use hand mirrors to check for urine crystals which lead to bad smells, Sim said.<br><br>Cheti, 34, is keen to pass on her new-found knowledge.<br><br>"I'm very happy to be in this toilet cleaner line, and after this course I will share with my friends everything I have learnt!"</div>
