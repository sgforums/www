            <div class='col-md body'>.... after deadline expires.<br><br>SINGAPORE : A hundred and five students are still holding on to offers from both the National University of Singapore and the Nanyang Technological University, even after the deadline to choose one offer has expired.<br><strong><br>There was an earlier outcry that these students were denying others on the waiting list a place at the universities.<br><br>But they will not face any penalties and places will still be kept for them.<br></strong><br>Some 1,500 students were supposed to have responded to the two universities earlier this week; most did, except for 105.<br><br>NUS and NTU say they will be extending the deadline for this group; they now have to reply by the end of the month.<br><br>But will there be penalties if they don't?<br><br>"We are quite hopeful the 105 will respond this time round," said R Rajaram, deputy director of the NUS Office of Admissions.<br><br>"In any case they're not impacting students on the wait list. We are going to go ahead and offer because we have the flexibility in varying our intake a little," he said.<br><br>From next Tuesday, the universities will also be making offers to suitable candidates on the waiting list.<br><br>About 1,300 are on the list.<br><br>To streamline the process next year, the universities plan to have a more coordinated approach.<br><br>One suggestion is to explore a common acceptance deadline.<br><br>"Students for example can accept online through the Web and if they make one acceptance then they are blocked off from making other acceptance. That's one possibility," said Mr Rajaram.<br><br>There will be another round of offers and acceptances as universities turn their attention to those on the waiting list.<br><br>But the universities believe that their enrolment figures will only stabilise sometime in August or September as some students may pull out from the local universities to head overseas. - CNA<br><br>[/quote]<br><br>typical kiasu singaporean behaviour? think only for of themselves and fail to think that what they are doing penalises someone else - ownself win, dont care others win or lose attitude.<br><br>hopefully these students will be penalised in some way - a stern warning letter will do something.<br><br></div>

The others will be taken into consideration when he is sentenced.<br><br>Police prosecutor Ting Ngee Kong said that after Madam Umadevi Krishnasamy, 29, placed an obituary for her late father on May 8, Shankar telephoned, claiming he was an insurance agent with Great Eastern Life Assurance Company.<br><br>He told her she could get a $46,000 payout on her father's insurance policy if she paid Shankar 'legal fees' of $381.<br><br>That afternoon, he collected the money and the death certificate from her two brothers at a bus stop in Tampines.<br><br>On May 4, Shankar tricked Madam Chelliah Kalaiarasi, 37, the same way, claiming she was due a $58,300 insurance payout.<br><br>Both women realised they had been cheated when the insurance company told them that their relatives had not been insured by Great Eastern.<br><br>Shankar also conned Madam Saudray Marimuthu, 45, on May 20 over a supposed $62,000 payout on her husband's death.<br><br>He got 'legal fees' twice from one family. First, Mr Thiruvalluvan Ganesan, 41, transferred $381 into Shankar's bank account on Sept 16, 2002, believing his dead brother-in-law had bought a $25,000 policy from American International Assurance.<br><br>Hours later, Shankar got another $381 from Mr Thiruvalluvan's sister, Madam Gnanambal Ganesan, 30, to process the claim, and she, too, transferred the money to him through an ATM.<br><br>Two years ago, Shankar convinced a woman and her daughter that he was a StarHub debt collector.<br><br>Miss Revathi Sinniah, 18, gave him $12 and a pair of gold earrings worth $55 as she did not have the $438 Shankar said she owed.<br><br>On Aug 26, 2002, she put the money and earrings in an envelope and left it at a flower pot outside her home in Serangoon North Avenue 3 and he picked it up.<br><br>Six days later, he called her mother, Madam Supolegeme Karuppan, 44, claiming that Miss Revathi owed StarHub more than $500.<br><br>Madam Supolegeme did not have enough to pay him, so she gave him her POSB ATM card and PIN.<br><br>He used them on Sept 7, 2002, to withdraw $680 from her account.<br><br>When Madam Supolegeme found out that StarHub had not engaged any debt collector, she made a police report. Four other people reported Shankar's bids to cheat them.<br><br>The prosecutor pressed for a custodial sentence because of Shankar's two previous convictions for cheating.<br><br>District Judge Aedit Abdullah postponed sentencing to July 9 pending a report on whether Shankar should be sent for corrective training.<br></div>
