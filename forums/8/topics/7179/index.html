            <div class='col-md body'>jquarts: regarding to your story, it was a stroy that occured many years ago in my company.I was in charlie com (the last charlie com as I was told)and the story was that this guy happened to be marching along with his platoon but went back to bunk as he was unwell.However, when his mates came back they could not find him and thus a search was on.Then finally they found him on the side of the road with all his fullpack items properly arranged as if ready for an inspection and along with it was his guts and all nicely arranged too.To make itmore of an enigma, the supposed autopsy states that he was kileed by a knife wound that was created from the inside of the stomach.As a result of this case, thur nights were kept free and not used for any night training.The room where they placed body was order by a taoist priest to have another extra door so that his spirit would be able to leave the place and thus the infamous 3 DOOR BUNK.When I was a recruit there, there were workers who were trying to renovate the bunk where they placed his body after the incident into our company line and b4 they started work, they hired a taoist priest to do a ritual to cleanse the room.CREEPY!!!!!wonder how mine instructors felt doing duty alone in there????????anyway that's my version handed down to me by my seniors.Anyone wishes to correct me?</div>

He (wisely) decided to roll back to sleep, but he was woken up again.. and again..<br><br>next morning, he was about to complain, but he realised that no one, esp if its a sergeant, will wake up in the middle of the night to disturb the recruits. He kept mum about the whole thing..<br><br>not much in terms of hair raising stories..<br><br>my advice: just siam them. and between a ghost and a wild boar, run away from the boar first.<br><br>archer<br><br></div>
