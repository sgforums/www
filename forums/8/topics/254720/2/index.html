As the box was nicely string-wrapped, I assume that it is okie. When I reach home and open the box, discovered that the 2 CDs for installation were badly scratched, and it looked like it has been used. I suspect that it could have been used before, or it is a 2nd-hand CD. I went back to the shop in the same evening with the game for an exchange. The middle-aged woman manning the shop was very rude and accused me of scratching the disk after installing the game into my computer to get a new set. I explained to her that I cannot play the game without the CD2, but she refuses to listen. Then another older man who was sitting outside the shop approaches me and told me that goods sold are not refundable, and shouted at me to get lost. And all this time I was calmly trying to convince them that the CDs were already badly scratched when I opened the box. Then the middle-aged woman starts to use vulgarities on me, and thats where I decided enough is enough, and I storm out of the shop. This is a lesson learnt for me to just stick to reputable retailers like Challenger.<br><br>Please be careful when you patronise this computer shop.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Rainforest88<br></div></blockquote>Ts too soft liao. They hurl vulgarities at u. This shall open the flood gate. SInce they are only auntie and old man. I will curse his children,family,ancestor and just stand outside the shop and shout 'Hei Tia' loudly and attract a scene and stand to shout out all their evil deed...<br><br>This type of people need to be treat nasty. U may not get yr money back or new CD. But at least u teach them a lesson and next time they will not be so arrogant and no respect for other.
