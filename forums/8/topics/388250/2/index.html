              <p>if it affects business in what way???????how many millions of dollars lost due to that verbal assault??and are there further people vebally assaulting company for incurredlosses???and whyt werent they included???its called discrimination!a criminal offence by singling a single person out from a swarm of other people doin the same thing as he is!</p>
              <p>and company has to prove due to that reason and not other factors from services being obsolete,recession,poor products from company to other media response thats affecting business!</p>
              <p>losses in company may be due to fact that u advertised in straits times and sent email with yer address to the customers or talked personally to the other person of product concerned.as long as there is taped recorded evidence and multiple witness of non-related 3rd party links will u be in hot soup.</p>
              <p>in or off the heat of battle, with gathered evidence u must think clearly and say yes or no for survival!</p>

              <p>that remind me of a  spore comic company sueing a boy for  $500,000 for selling or buying some comic book over the internet many years ago.dont know what happened to boy.</p>
              <p>then there was the case where this fresh  spore poly girl got sued for $1million by company when she didnt turn up for work on first day.the company said they needed her services and then the losses.case was thrown out and judge scolded company and gal didnt need to pay  a cent for that.</p>
              <p>they all have alot in common these 2 companies...bully youngsters and make spore a dangerous place to live and work.such companies and entities should and will not exist!!!</p>

              <p>if it affects business in what way???????how many millions of dollars lost due to that verbal assault??and are there further people vebally assaulting company for incurredlosses???and whyt werent they included???its called discrimination!a criminal offence by singling a single person out from a swarm of other people doin the same thing as he is!</p>
              <p>and company has to prove due to that reason and not other factors from services being obsolete,recession,poor products from company to other media response thats affecting business!</p>
              <p>losses in company may be due to fact that u advertised in straits times and sent email with yer address to the customers or talked personally to the other person of product concerned.as long as there is taped recorded evidence and multiple witness of non-related 3rd party links will u be in hot soup.</p>
              <p>in or off the heat of battle, with gathered evidence u must think clearly and say yes or no for survival!</p>

              <p>Basically, there are many of their customers/future and potential customers, staff/ex staff of the company who saw my post in the forum with the company's name.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I did not advertise in straits time. Read carefully my 1st post. I only posted online in a forum.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I don't think they will be able to calculate the losses but they may say craps like some customers and people who might be interested to buy their products/join the company may change their mind when reading my post</p>
