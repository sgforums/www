              <p>I am currently facing some defamation lawsuits by a big organisation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I do not qualify for free legal lawyers provided by the government as my income is $11k+ a year which their cap of income is at $10k a year to qualify for free lawyers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyone have any good recommendations of affordable lawyers? If have can message me or email the details to <a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:daveteoteo@yahoo.com">daveteoteo@yahoo.com</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lawyers charging $500 a hour is too expensive for me to afford.</p>

              <p>Hi Daveteo,</p>
              <p>Please do not be panic. Stay calm.</p>
              <p>When a company says that it wants to sue you, it does not mean that it will really charge you in court.</p>
              <p>The company will first send you a letter by its lawyer stating its charges and the damages over you and requests you to reply within a given period of time.</p>
              <p>You will just acknowledge the recipt of the letter and ask them for documentary evidence to back up for its charges against you and just wait for its reply through its lawyer.</p>
              <p>If the company refuses to provide the evidence and only keep stating the charges, you can then reply in your letter to them that a charge must be supported by evidence and just wait for its letter. If you do not hear from them, then the case is considered over.</p>
              <p>Next, bring the documentary evidence to the lawyers providing free legal services at the community centres and ask them whether there is any legal ground.</p>
              <p>The url link for Singapore Law Society is</p>
              <p> <a href="http://www.lawsociety.org.sg/directory/Default.aspx">http://www.lawsociety.org.sg/directory/Default.aspx</a></p>
              <p>and you can call up the lawyers to check on their fees for your case.</p>
              <p>Daveteo, the actual legal process only starts when the company files a charge with the court and gets a writ of summons and serve the summons to you in your home address.</p>
              <p>It is to be noted that the company might not really go to the court and files the charge with the court as it will defnitely cost it more than $20,000 (likely to cost $100,000 or more) if the case is really heard in the court and the company gets only $20,000 from you if it wins the case.</p>
              <p>Daveteo, it might not be advisable to get a lawyer to fight the case in court as it will definitely cost you more than $20,000 (likely to cost $100,000 or more) if the case is really heard in the court. It will be better if you represent yourself in court, the lawyers providing free legal advice at the community centres will be able to help you on this, if the company really goes all the ways and the case is really to be heard in the court.</p>
              <p>Hope this will be of help to you.</p>
