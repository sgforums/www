We want to move out, but no money to move out.<br><br></div></blockquote>The grass isn't greener on the other side. Ever been an immigrant &gt;WORKER&lt; in another country? You will have to work 20 hours a day and if you have a university diploma you might get to clean toilets.<br><br>Singapore is very rich per capita. You will do better in Singapore.<br>If people want to move in to your nation and work, it means it's better than their nation. I've been to nations that have no immigration, you don't want to go there. 80% unemployment. 4000 in inflation. Stores have to move together to last a little longer.</div>

Its considered pretty low compared to other countries.<br><br>But if you are coming to Singapore just to relax, i dont think its your place. Singapore is a fast moving country. And by fast, other then economy, its also the walking pace of Singaporeans.<br><br>read somewhere that Singaporeans are the world's fastest walkers. yeah, and if you are too slow or you are blocking anybody, chances are, you will be cursed ONLY.<br><br>Also, moving to Singapore cost ALOT. Getting a place to stay is just freaking expensive. For a five room HDB flat here in Singapore, i can get a 3 storey bungalow in France. So think about it.<br><br>But you can be promised that this country is very safe. Albeit ppl do get murdered/slash. but generally its much much lower then other countries. Rule of thumb: Dont antagonise large groups.<br><br>Also, Our healthcare is relatively cheap. So you decide! Oh, and we are actually a bustling youth city.
