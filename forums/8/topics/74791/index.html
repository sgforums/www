For instance, if he asks for advice, and I share my opinions wif him (Simply telling him tat he shld do tiz to prevent certain things fr happening - Juz my opinion &amp; not by FORCE), he'll think likewise.  If tat'z the case, he shldn't hv asked for advice and kept grumbling in the 1st place. There's also another case, where he quitted his job to look for a job of his dream.  When we simply chatted &amp; I share my interview experience wif him, he felt tat I'm boastful. What kind of world is tat??
