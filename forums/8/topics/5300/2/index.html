With the money in the world, I would go around and collect back every single object that we both shared together. From the simplest chopsticks to every single pebbles that cross our paths. I would keep all these things in in a time capsule and every year I will continue to increase my collection even after marriage. For I want to remember every moment spent with her. Every special song that we both share.<br>As for the wedding ring, I can travel the world just to get the right stone for her wedding ring. It may not be the most expensive stone curved. But it must be something we both loved.<br>As for the proposal, I would announced to the world. I want everyone to witness this day. Unless she prefer the tone down, peaceful and quite little chapel.<br>I would fly to the end of the world to get her something just to make her smile</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, actually the money doesn't really come into the picture when talking about the ideal senario... the money just makes things more ideal... the mood is more important.<br><br>I will like a pool-side wedding at Sentosa. It will start when the sun is setting and the setting sun will bring that kind of beautiful bloom to my face [imageine Julie Roberts in Runaway Bride...the very last part on top of a hill].<br>There will be a jazz band performing blue jazz. The lights will be soft and flowers or plants will be all over the place. There will be some suitable flowers floating on the surface of the pool, and possibly lighted floating candles. All the tables will have candles as centrepiece.<br>The guests will be casually dressed, hawaiian -style. I won't be in a Vera Wong's gown even though I can afford it. There will be champange flowing around...everything is so light and casual... I will be stealing kisses every now and then with my husband.<br><br>Fast forward...<br><br>And when every guests has left, my husband and I will stipe and jump into the pool and make unforgettable love in the pool  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>The honeymoon will be on a cruise to some Caribbean islands. We will dress and dine, but I guess we will be in the cabin most of the time.<br><br>Well, the rest of the money... just keep it for future honeymoons.</div>
