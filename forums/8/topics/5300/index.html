            <div class='col-md body'>Me... simple... I would want a quiet wedding reception in Australia first, with a few close friends, maybe in a garden or something. We'll then take off to Hong Kong, his home country, and have a proper wedding dinner with all his relatives and friends, most probably at a really, really posh hotel, and pray that no 'gu wa zai' will come and spoil our dinner.<br><br>Come morning, we'll take a plane to SG, and have a wild time....maybe not the usual wedding dinner? Haven't really thought of what would be wild enough... maybe a yacht party.... exchange our vows for the THIRD time during sunset... soooo cliche, but anyway, it'll be a really wild wedding party, with no boring traditions, since his parents would most probably want that to be done in Hong Kong. My parents are quite open, so I guess they wouldn't really mind.<br><br>Honeymoon..... Around the world!!!!! No finance limit here, rt?? So, our honeymoon will last for a year, and we can explore every bit of the earth for a whole year... most probably not enough time, but we'll try, or just keep taking leave from work.<br><br>But, wake up to reality, my husband-to-be might not be Mr. Millionaire, and that doesn't really bother me. I guess just as long as I'm legally married to him, and he loves me, no matter how cheap the wedding ceremony may be, I wouldn't mind. I think that if we were to exchange our vows at a church with no designer dress or suit, I'll still think that's romantic.<br><br>Please note... this dream might be changed anytime, if things do not work out for us in the future... then I'll have to start dreaming of another wedding reception.<br><br>Details, I'll provide another day........ till then<br><br>[This message has been edited by blur (edited 29-11-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1. I would rent the Good year blip and 'pay' (bribe lah...with 10 million can do almost anything)Singapore Government to let me land the blimp on Orchard Road with me starpped onto the center of the blimp by ropes pulling my arms and leg...thus causing tension to keep me up against the side of said blimp...Then the lights on the side of the blimp would blip continuously..."MARRY ME RINOA!!!"...:-)While my sillhuette(is this how it's spelled?) is used as the substitute for the letter "I" in Rinoa....or better yet, I would pay Pierce Brosnan to be up there...:-)<br><br>2.  After which, I would fly out of my ropes(if I am tied up), or fly out from the control booth(if Pierce Brosnan is tied up)...using my space age, personally designed  by Nasa with an intel inside Pentium IV processor personal rocket boosters strapped to my back.  I would blast by all the chio girls on Orchard with my Million dollar rocket boosters on overthrust while they swoon and whisper among themselves ,"why didn't I ever accept his advances...He's so cool(now that I have money..hee hee)"...<br><br>I would snatch my Girl Friend up and into my arms while we balst towards Heaven...and I would lift her up to me in a vertical position and ask her to marry me again...After which i would kiss her and tell her I have loved her since before I was born...<br><br>Then as we are kissing with her safely in my arms, we slowly descend in a slow spiral to land on the Pavement in front of HMV where I would signal Pierce Brosnan (if he was tied there) to signal Kitaro, who is now standing on top of the blimp, to play the wedding song on the Japanese flute with a full complement of musicians that only Kitaro can command...<br><br>then I would ask Rinoa to marry me right then right there and ease myself away from her embrace to slip a Maltese Diamond Bought from the London Museum for a cool 5 million dollars onto her finger and get down on my knees right after Aaron Kwok bows down and slips a genuine antique persian rug under my knees...<br><br>Then I would lightly place my lips upon her ring finger and say, "Rinoa, I am eternally yours through lifes every imbalances.."...........and the Good looking guys observing from spinellis cafe and Starbucks from across the street would throw their cappucinos in digust and Jealousy onto the ground and stamp on their emporio Armani Jackets knowing that even though they have tons of money, they would never go to such extravagance to ask for a womans hand in marriage...and then they would drop to both knees, regardles of whether they have a GF or not, and break out in tears for such a beauty being taken away from their future grasps.<br><br>After which we would sit down at a table at Spinnellis and order ourselves a cup of expresso with wich we would drink to anoint ourselves in front of the cashier boy who was a priest hired to play the cashier boy part...and the cashier boy would say, " I now pronounce you man and wife!"<br><br>and I would embrace Rinoa and kiss her gently....then after, I would whipp out my designer 3COM Palm Pilot 100 with a 900 Mhz AMD K17 mini processor with a 300 Mhz system bus and jot down the exact moment and time that we kissed our first kiss after being married...and then I would instant messenger an email to the SAF SQuadron with my built-in T-1 mobile data connectivity kit...(from the PDA)<br><br>and a full SAF squadron of FA18 Hornets would fly overhead dropping gift vouchers for Takashimaya to all "attending" the open ceremony.....<br><br>...and I would switch my blaster pack to full throttle and blast off into the sunset towards the coming moon....to live happily ever after....<br><br>hee hee...I hope you like the idea Rinoa...:-)..but I think I may have exceeded the 10 million dollar limit...:-)...by about another 10 or 20 million...:-)<br><br>[This message has been edited by firewire (edited 29-11-1999).]</div>

Maybe somewhere in Hokkado or South Africa.<br><br>The dinner will be prepared will be a mix of Japanese and Chinese. I'll get a few bands, both classical and modern, from Singapore and have them play throughout the night.
