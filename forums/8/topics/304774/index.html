            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys,<br><br>I was thinking about to take up a MBA course in these couple of years.<br>However, i would like to seek your opinion of these issues.<br><br>1) Is there a demand for for MBA in the market right now? If so what are the prospect for MBA holders.<br>If so, will it benefit a fresh person or it will most likely to benefit one which has more work experience.<br>So where will the fresh one usually be allocated should they get employed.<br><br>2)Is there any traits in a person that will benefit from it?<br>Should they be like knowledgeable, good communication skill, good network etc? Sometimes a person who is fresh may not be able to excel better than one who had exposal.<br>Should we prepared ourself to possess leadership skill and need to do a lot of self studies before we actually start the course?<br><br>Any tip on what we should do before we are considered rdy to embark on this path?</div>

              <p>Currently, i have a  degree in business and management studies specialise in marketing. So far, what i have seen is that, it is already a very common thing to possess degree, and sometimes it is "tough" to seek a good job. As the higher you go,  the less position there is available for you.</p>
              <p>I had a friend working in SMU, so he was asking me to join him in getting an MBA as it helps in the future, In which degree holders my stop at a manager lvl whereas MBA may hit anywhere from GM to dircector lvl.</p>
              <p>He has told me all the beauty of MBA, but personally i ponder is there such a market. and what kind of ppl will actually benefit from it. And what kind of course will there be a demand.</p>
