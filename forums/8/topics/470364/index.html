              <p>Hi all. </p>
              <p>Forgive my ignorance ar. I don't know anything about credit cards. I must be calculating something wrong or missing something.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I called DBS to asked about loan and credit card. I wanted to buy a new computer, laptop, sofa and some smaller furnitures. I thought of borrowing $5000-$7000</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am quite a money consious person. Everyone I know all owns a credit card. I only have a debit card. I don't understand. I am currently earning $20,000-$25,000 annually. No car. No house installments. Only got M1 SP S&amp;CC Bills. All other entertainment. Cash. Haha. No debts currently.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The minimum amount paid per month for credit card is $50 or 3% which ever is higher. The outstanding amount is charged at 25% per annum. Wah lao. I know so many people use credit cards but I am sure they understand 25% is a lot. If I use to buy $1000 item I pay $50. The remaining is $950. After interest 25% it has become 25% x $950 = $237.50. That means I still got $1187.50 outstanding. Siao bo.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If I loan $1000 and pay annually. The interest is 10%. I pay finish in one year. Total cost to me is $1100. siao...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I must be calculating something wrong. I must be missing something. Can someone explain the benefits/purpose of credit card? A detailed mathematical explantion is much appreciated! Thank you!.</p>

              <p>Basically, you are taking a loan from a bank every time you use a credit card. The loaned amount goes directly to the shop. Then you have to pay back the loan with interest. </p>
              <p>On my part, I don't have a credit card even though I am already 30 years old and earn a decent wage.</p>
              <p>Instead, I have two debit cards (one Visa, one Mastercard). This makes sure that I can only spend the money that I already have.</p>

              compiled from different credit providers.<br> <br> As most lenders will check your credit file to assess your credit
              worthiness prior to making a decision, a good credit repayment
              history will make it easier for you to obtain credit and to qualify
              for loans.<br> <br> By reviewing your credit report regularly, it allows you to be
              aware of any information that is uploaded on your credit
              file.<br> <br> The other advantage of monitoring your credit file is that it
              protects against possible fraudulent use of your personal details
              to obtain credit.<br> <br> CBS’ ‘My Credit Monitor’ service checks your report daily and
              notifies you by email when key changes are detected. Early
              detection is key to minimising the damage that ID theft can have on
              your credit.<br> <br> You can subscribe to ‘My Credit Monitor ’ service at any Singapore
              Post branch or visit the CBS office to make an application.<br> <br> Your credit report also helps credit providers to make faster and
              more objective lending decisions. By providing credit data to its
              members (credit providers) under authorised conditions, CBS helps
              them to determine whether or not the person applying for credit is
              a good credit risk. In doing this, lenders can make better lending
              decisions quickly and objectively.<br> <br> This will also contribute to a more competitive credit marketplace
              among the credit providers. With the Bureau in place, responsible
              customers can expect faster and more competitive services from the
              credit providers.<br> <br>  <br> <br> 1. Pay your bills on time As far as possible, strive to pay up in
              full and on time.<br> <br> Late or missed payments will certainly lower your credit
              worthiness. Therefore, be sure to check your bills to see when
              payments are due. Late fees and interest penalties add up quickly
              and make it hard to pay the balance. Payment history is an
              important factor in determining your credit worthiness. Since
              recent history carries more weight than what happened five years
              ago, getting in the habit of making on-time payments is an
              incredibly powerful way to improve your credit worthiness.<br> <br> 2. Pay down your debts and consider charging less<br> <br> Lenders like to see plenty of breathing room between the amount of
              debt reported on your credit cards and your total credit limits.
              The more debt you pay off, the wider that gap and the better your
              credit worthiness. When you pay the full balance on your bill each
              month, you are taking advantage of an interest-free loan from the
              card issuer. If you make only the minimum payment on a significant
              balance, it can take years to pay off the full debt. If you are
              unable to meet the payment deadlines, let your financial
              institution know and the reasons why.<br> <br> 3. Limit the number of credit cards you own<br> <br> Avoid multiple sources of credit. It is more manageable to keep
              track of 2 credit cards than 10. Opening a new credit line may
              reduce your credit worthiness, especially if you do not have a long
              and favorable credit history.<br> <br> 4. Cancel any unused cards<br> <br> If you have many credit card accounts but are only using a few, it
              is a good idea to close out the unused ones. However, it is
              advisable to keep the cards that you have had the longest and
              cancel the new ones as a long record of prompt payments will
              improve your credit worthiness.<br> <br> 5. Stay out of bankruptcy if you can<br> <br> Bankruptcy is the most catastrophic impediment to your good credit
              reputation -- far worse than delinquencies, loans or collections.
              Its impact, however, is dependent on how many defaults you made on
              your credit before you filed.<br> <br> 6. Don’t be afraid of credit counselling<br> <br> Most of us want to pay our bills on time and as agreed. However,
              there could be unforeseen circumstances such as loss of employment,
              business failure etc, which makes it impossible to settle the
              minimum payments on the due dates stipulated by the bank. If you’re
              overloaded with high-interest debt and are in danger of falling
              behind on your payments -- or you already have -- consider working
              with a nonprofit agency such as Credit Counselling Singapore to set
              up a debt repayment plan. They can help you to reschedule payments
              with the creditors, negotiate lower interest rates and help you pay
              off your bills within a few years.<br> <br> 7. Get your credit report<br> <br> Your credit report is a record of your credit payment history
              compiled from different credit providers. As most lenders will
              check your credit file to assess your credit worthiness prior to
              making a decision, a good credit repayment history will make it
              easier for you to obtain credit and to qualify for loans. By
              reviewing your credit report regularly, it allows you to be aware
              any information that is uploaded on your credit file. The other
              advantage of monitoring your credit file is that it protects
              against possible fraudulent use of your personal details to obtain
              credit.<br> <br> 8. Know the differences between Debit Card and Credit Card<br> <br> When you charge a purchase on your credit card, you have a minimum
              of 30 days to pay the bill. If you do so, it will be to your
              benefit as you’re taking advantage of the card issuer’s money as a
              no-interest loan, provided you pay the balance in full each month.
              On the other hand, when you charge a purchase on a debit card, your
              bank will deduct your deposit account immediately. If you do not
              have sufficient funds in your bank account, the transaction will
              not be accepted.<br> <br> 9. Don’t close accounts if you still have debt remaining on
              them<br> <br> Closing accounts before they are fully paid can hurt your credit
              worthiness. If you are planning on not using a certain credit card
              anymore, you should wait to close it until after you have paid it
              off. In order to keep yourself from charging, simply cut up the
              card into pieces and keep it in a drawer.<br> <br> 10. Don’t apply for lots of credit at once<br> <br> People are bombarded with new credit card offers all the time.
              While it may be OK to sign up for a new credit card here and there,
              it is a bad idea to sign up for several at once. This sends a
              signal to creditors that you are desperate for credit and are a
              risk to loan to. Resist the urge to sign up for many credit cards
              at once and don’t overextend yourself.<br> <br>  <br> <br> Credit is an integral part of everyday modern life. From buying
              movie tickets, to paying for a meal at a restaurant or buying a
              car, credit is used. The most common use of credit is through
              credit cards. Knowing how to use credit wisely is a critical part
              of managing your finances and key to your financial health.<br> <br> Advantages of using Credit:<br> Able to buy need items now<br> Don’t have to carry cash<br> Creates a record of purchases<br> More convenient than writing cheques<br> Consolidates bills into one payment<br> <br> Disadvantages of using Credit:<br> Interest (higher cost of items)<br> May require additional fees<br> Financial difficulties may arise if one loses track of how much has
              been spent each month<br> Increased impulse buying may occur</p>
