              <p>I am not a chinese chauvinist but i must say that the chinese or Han culture,tradition and influence are very strong and powerful. As long as a place is populated by many of these chinese Han eventually the culture and traditon of locals, especially those weaker and less established one like that of our unique singapore culture will eventually be annihilated and being 'Hanised' or at best integrated with strong elements of Han culture.</p>
              <p>Looking into history and we'll see that. The emperor of Qing dynasty, though were from manchuria, many of their tradions and living habits(especially the later emperors) were eventually influenced and became almost like the Han people. Manchurians starting from third emperor Yongzhen has already lost so much of their original identity after their almost hundred years of stay in central plain that the emperor remarked that manchurian cannot even ride a horse now let alone fighting aggressively in the desert like their ancestors. He reasoned tat the manchurian lifestyle has been significantly altered by the Hans even though they were supposedly to be stronger culturally and in military power since they defeated Ming dynasty Han empire. Eventually it turned out that the 'conqueror' got conquered by their prey instead, in terms of tradition and thinking. This is also evident in the mongol Yuan dynasty.</p>
              <p>Looking at singapore, we are only a very young nation. How strong and established do you think is our so called unique culture and multiracial identity? With the mighty onslaught of PRC chinese and their culture, eventually in essence we might just be another SAR of china like that of Hong Kong even though we can call ourselves an independent nation with an elected govt aka PAPPY and elected president..</p>

              <p>the real reason is becoz they know the people here hate them more and more and young people not afraid to vote opposition so they're bringing new citizens that will vote for them................</p>
              <p>those that are not new citizens can also help prop up the gigantic CPF ponzi game................including more GST collection for PAP..................</p>
              <p>PAP is now like the CEOs of a corporation, the citizens are the workers................it doesn't matter who are the workers as long as the Ceo is the same.............</p>
