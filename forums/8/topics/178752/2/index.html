            <div class='col-md body'>Harlequin type ichthyosis (also harlequin ichthyosis, ichthyosis congenita, or keratosis diffusa fetalis), the most severe form of congenital ichthyosis, is characterized by a thickening of the keratin layer in fetal human skin, appearing as massive, diamond-shaped scales. In addition, the eyes, ears, mouth, and other appendages may be abnormally contracted. The scaly keratin limits the child's movement, and because it is cracked where normal skin would fold, it is easily pregnable by bacteria and other contaminants, resulting in a serious risk of fatal infection.<br><br>Sufferers are known as harlequin fetuses, harlequin babies, or harlequins.<br><br>The harlequin type designation comes from both the baby's apparent facial expression and the diamond-shape of the scales (resembling the costume of Arlecchino), which are caused by severe hyperkeratosis. Seventeenth century entertainers known as jesters, or harlequins, wore costumes with diamond patterns on them, as well as a particular style of face paint. The features of the harlequin fetus resemble this stylized makeup, and their faces are often pulled tight into grim parodies of a clown's smile. The disease can be diagnosed in the womb by way of fetal skin biopsy.<br><br><img src="http://www.xs4all.nl/~stgvisie/VISIE/untitled03.JPG"><br><br><img src="http://www.xs4all.nl/~stgvisie/VISIE/untitled05.JPG"><br><br><img src="http://www.xs4all.nl/~stgvisie/VISIE/untitled06.JPG"><br><br><img src="http://www.xs4all.nl/~stgvisie/VISIE/untitled15.JPG"><br><br><img src="http://www.xs4all.nl/~stgvisie/VISIE/untitled18.JPG"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i was right...its indeed a genetic mutation<br><br>wiki:<br><br>Mutations in the ABCA12 gene cause harlequin ichthyosis. The ABCA12 gene makes a protein that is essential for the normal development of skin cells. Although the protein's exact function is unknown, researchers believe that it probably plays a major role in the transport of lipids (fats) in the outermost layer of skin (the epidermis). Mutations in the ABCA12 gene lead to the production of an abnormally small version of the protein that cannot transport lipids properly. The loss of functional ABCA12 protein disrupts the normal development of the epidermis, preventing the skin from forming an effective barrier and resulting in the hard, thick scales characteristic of harlequin ichthyosis.<br><br>This condition is likely inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means two copies of the gene in each cell are altered. Most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder are carriers of one copy of the altered gene but do not show signs and symptoms of the disorder.</div>
