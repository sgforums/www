              the fees for foreign worker to work in singapore is extraoridinary expensive because there is too many middle man. singapore agent sometimes give shop $ rebate when they sign a worker china side need to make money too.
              
              but the govt is doing something alr, there are strict rules and laws to cut down the number of foreign workers.
              
              but think back if we do not have foreign workers taking all the tough job like washing, cleaning etc who will do all this, will you be one?

              <p><br>Just thought you should know that i think it make matter worst.</p>
              <p>Govt levies has partly created the problems. I think govt need to look at income withholding tax directly from foreign worker rather than levies.</p>
              <p>There are too many middle man when you charge high levies the agent basically eats into workers salary.</p>
              <p>Currently sub con to main contractor black market is $500 per head pocket Cash. 10 worker 5K cash pocket.  These 5 k will be deducted from worker salary. As such worker get less than 50 bucks a day. maybe as low as $35 - $25 a day.</p>
