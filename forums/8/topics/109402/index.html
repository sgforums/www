I tend to forget that Rome wasnt build in a day. But if you hunger for success is not there, how can you ever hope to be successful? Already my colleagues at the new job are a bit wary of me. They can sensed that im too eager to earn $$$ and I wanna start as soon as possible. I just unwittingly portrayed myself as an eager ass. But the thing is, thats nothing bad what?</div>
