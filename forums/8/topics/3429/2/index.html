I try to avoid for as long as I can not to go on bed with a girl &amp; I often will refuse them, cos I know that I do not love her dearly, so if I have sex with her, It will not be fair to her.<br><br>From your name which is "bobo" traditionally is given to girls with big breasts &amp; who are without any brains... fits u perfectly. doesn't it?<br><br>stop criticing me cos u are pissed that I am offering someone the hand of friendship &amp; love.<br><br>I said already that as soon as I realize that I can acquire a girl, I loose interest in her.

So its "No beauty no hump" huh?<br>"If u are nice enough i might marry u straight..."  wat a heap of bullshit! Look here mf i've said it b4 n i'll say it again: GET A LIFE! Dun be such a hypocrite!<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by galvaniZer:</div><div class="quote_body">Osama is a CIA AGENT. it was the jews &amp; the americans who killed &amp; arranged for the terrorist attacks. whether or not osama was involved is a different story. The main reason is simply that americans can dig for more oil in Afghanistan, so their target was afghanistan from the very beginning &amp; the second reason is that their economy takes a dive in every 10 years. REmember bush's father attacking Baghdad? then also their economy revived cos they created demand of weapons by creating insecurity among countries &amp; the same thing happened now &amp; we can all see that their economy<br>is already recovering... If you say that Osama did it &amp; al Qaeda did it, then please forward ur proof...??? I have not seen a single proof that says Osama did it. Every citizen of this world must see the proof that Osama did it. &amp; then if he did it then was War the only option &amp; killing thousands of Innocents Taleban? It is built in taleban tradition not to ask their guest to leave their home. Simple......</div></blockquote>Hey dun go hiding the fact that u r a extremist mat from malaysai... (no i din spell wrongly... to me the country is run by a bunch of SAI... ooooooh sorry if i've belittled ur beloved mahathir) No offense to malays nor muslims or Islam..... all my shit are only on extremists... on pple like u; my seriously fu****-up fren. Kindly stop corrupting pple's mind here, kindly go back to malaysai and spread ur extremist shit there since u said before ur beloved mahathir and ur press have the right to say wat they please.<br><br>One last point my SFUF, if u can't stand pple disagreeing to wat u say... DUN POST IN A FORUM!!! Go to the Speaker's Corner in spore and do all your bullshitting there! No one will give a damn to wat u say... or maybe u should not speak out too loudly... cos SFU extremists like u might just end getting a free tour package of spore prison..courtesy of the ISD. Puuii! Wasted so many precious minutes of my life talking to scum... gd day to u my SFUF!<br><br>P.S. If u reali not a malaysain kindly drop a line to ISD cos i'm VERY sure they would like to hold a very lengthy interview with u.. for ur very unique views of certain things happening around the world..</div>
