I heard it was from another fund ...<br><br>the HQ is not bad, I went before...<br><br>CEO I meet him before ...<br><br>as for money ... you still have to pay for treatment the only support some ... my friend is one of them using the fund...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I never bothered to watch any of these shows. The reason being I am not sure where the money I am donating will go to. I have heard that only a very small sum actually goes to the patients. Why can't NKF tells us where the money is going? I dun want to see my hard-earned money go into the pockets of the CEO and for his expensive trips, and all. Until the day when a clear report is out, I will never donate at all.
