            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">Seriously, I want also Singapore's people to help me from Tokyo, Japan.</span><br><br>On Nov 7, 2006 I gave Ms Charmine Hiroyo Koda Â�KÂ“cÂƒVÂƒÂƒÂ�[Âƒ~ÂƒÂ“ÂŒÃµÂ‘Ã£, UNIC (United Nations Information Center) Tokyo Director my letter.<br>From Aug 27, 2006 I'm posting my SOS letter to politicians' homes by my bicycle, not through post office. By Dec 12, 2006, I went to 131 politicians' homes.<br>On Nov 30, 2006 I could talk to the Counseling for Crime Sufferers of Japan's Metropolitan Police Department ÂŒxÂŽÂ‹Â’Â¡Â�EÂ”Ã†Â�ÃŸÂ”Ã­ÂŠQÂŽÃ’Â‘ÂŠÂ’kÂ�ÂŠ and I could give my crime sufferer's documents. Although on Sep 5, 2006 Mejiro Police Station ÂŒxÂŽÂ‹Â’Â¡Â–ÃšÂ”Â’Â�Â� caught and question me for 30 minutes to 1 hour for security at Yasuhiro Nakasone Â’Â†Â‘]Â�ÂªÂ�NÂ�O's home.<br>On Dec 4, 2006 I posted the same documents to Human Rights Division, Tokyo Legal Affairs Bureau Â“ÂŒÂ‹ÂžÂ–@Â–Â±Â‹Ã‡Â�lÂŒÂ Â—iÂŒÃ¬Â•Â”.<br>On Dec 14, 2006, 8:30 am, a police man came to my home to question about me to my parents not to me against my SOS letters. Japan's Police doesn't help me like on the Toshiba side.<br>No one help me in Japan.<br><br>From Oct 25, 2006 I'm posting my SOS letter to also foreign media's Tokyo offices like UPI, CNN, South Korea's KBS and German's ARD and German, French, British, Finnish, Netherlands and Swedish chambers of commerce in Japan and American state Tokyo offices by my bicycle, not through Japan's post office.<br>I hope foreign agencies inform my message to their embassies for their brave justice and kindness. I believe them more than Japanese politicians. But they also are mind-controlled by Toshiba Corp in Japan ?<br><br>I went and left my letter on posts or embassy's areas to Lithuania ambassador on Nov 2, 2006, Czech ambassador on Dec 11, 2006, Vatican ambassador on Dec 15, 2006, Luxembourg, Belgian, Finnish, Norwegian, Swiss and Danish ambassadors on Dec 16, 2006, Canadian, Austrian, Australian, Italian and Netherlands ambassadors on Dec 20, 2006.<br>(I also went to Malay Embassy but I still don't go to Singapore Embassy.)<br>In the letter I asked them to inform about me to Amb Thomas Schieffer.<br><br>Couldn't my letters reach Amb Thomas Schieffer and the others under the Toshiba Corp's mind-control interruption ? I sent my letter to South Korean ambassador on Dec 12, 2006 and American, French, German and British ambassadors on Dec 15, 2006 through Japan's post office through Japan's post office.<br>I knew the embassies have Japanese security police and I can't reach them. I think, at the entrance of British Embassy in Tokyo on Jul 8, 2005 Japanese police caught a Japanese man refugee (Katsumi Ariyoshi Â—LÂ‹gÂ�ÂŸÂ”Ã¼, 58, jobless and homeless) like Chinese police in the North Korean refugee case and Japanese Government unfairly labeled him 'trespass' and 'schizophrenia'.<br><br>On Jan 23, 2007 I sent my letter from Tokyo, Japan to US Sen Barbara Boxer of San Francisco, USA. Only she, maybe not auto responder, kindly e-mailed me back once on Feb 14, 2005.<br>I asked her. Can I meet her in Washington DC in Apr 2007 and when ? Even if her answer is 'Yes' or 'No', I wanted her answer by letter. Therefore I set her letter with an international stamp in my letter.<br>If my letter could reach her under the Toshiba Corp's mind-control interruption, I believe she kindly sends her answer letter to me.<br>I will send my letter also to US Rep Duncan Hunter, US Sen Richard Shelby, Mr Richard Perle of AEI, Mr William Triplett of Variety, President George Bush and some other US senators in Jan 2007.<br><br>I need to be a refugee from Japan to America, South Korea, France, Germany or a humanist country. Because I have been a Mind-Control Victim by Toshiba Corp Â“ÂŒÂŽÃ… since 1997 in my unconsciousness and since Dec 1, 1999 in my consciousness and Japanese Government persons haven't helped me since I asked to help in Mar 2003 the first. Toshiba Corp and Nishida Atsutoshi Â�Â¼Â“cÂŒÃºÂ‘Â�, the Toshiba-Ogikai Â“ÂŒÂŽÃ…Â�Ã®Â‰Ã¯ leader, will label me 'neurotic' the last.<br>(For illegal microwave in Japan Japan's Ministry of Public Management, Home Affairs, Posts and Telecommunications Â‘Â�Â–Â±Â�Ãˆ claimed to China around Dec 8, 2006 but it couldn't claim to Toshiba Corp 'the crazy microwave criminal'.)<br><br>- My important thing ; On Sep 21, 2006 I found book 'Â�}Â‰Ã° Â�Ã´Â”]ÂŒÂ‚Â‘ÃžÂƒ}ÂƒjÂƒÂ…ÂƒAÂƒÂ‹' (1995).<br>On the book medical Dr Shingo Takahashi Â�Â‚Â‹Â´Â�aÂŒÃ¡, an assistant professor of the Medical Department of Toho University Â“ÂŒÂ–MÂ‘Ã¥ÂŠwÂˆÃ£ÂŠwÂ•Â” and specialist of psychiatry, simply says microwave can mind-control and abuse people. -<br>And I can't ask him to help. Just like a Japan's purge, nobody knows where he is now after Aug 2005.<br><br>Takahashi's book is easy like children can understand, but no my family member can try to understand the Toshiba Corp's mind-control abuse crime to me for Toshiba Corp's mind-control interruption.<br>Like fools, on the side of Toshiba Corp 'the enemy' my father and mother constantly say "It is a big damage for Japan to ruin Toshiba Corp Â“ÂŒÂŽÃ…Â‚ÂªÂ’Ã—Â‚ÃªÂ‚Â½Â‚Ã§Â“ÃºÂ–{Â‚ÂªÂ‘Ã¥Â•Ã�Â‚Ã…Â‚ÂµÂ‚Ã¥Â‚Â¤ !".<br><br>The crazy Toshiba-Ogikai Â“ÂŒÂŽÃ…Â�Ã®Â‰Ã¯ leaders, Tomohiro Takahashi Â�Â‚Â‹Â´Â’qÂ�G (Toshiba General Affairs RMG Â“ÂŒÂŽÃ…Â‘Â�Â–Â±RMG (in Jan 2000)), Shigeru Ootsuka Â‘Ã¥Â’Ã‹Â–ÃŽ (Toshiba General Affairs Div Â“ÂŒÂŽÃ…Â‘Â�Â–Â± (in Jan 2000)), Kiichi Ogata ÂƒIÂƒKÂƒ^ÂƒLÂƒCÂƒ` (Toshiba IEG Div Â“ÂŒÂŽÃ…IEG (in Jan 2000)) and Toshihiro Sawaoka Ã VÂ‰ÂªÂ�rÂ�G (DVD Sales Sect of Toshiba IEG Div Â“ÂŒÂŽÃ…IEGÂ�EDVDÂ�Â¤ (in Jan 2000)), are there. Their crazy Toshiba group interrupts me harder everyday since Dec 1, 1999 because I only called Toshiba Corp fool on a day in Apr 1999. They watch me now.<br><br>Now only time is on my side. My family isn't on my side (for Toshiba Corp's mind-control). Any persons is visibly none on my side. Although I believe in World's internet some persons keep or read my messages as on my side.<br><br>In Mar 2006 I read Mikio Haruna Â�tÂ–Â¼ÂŠÂ²Â’j's book 'ÂƒXÂƒNÂƒÂŠÂƒÂ…Â�[Â‰Â¹Â‚ÂªÂ�Ã�Â‚Â¦Â‚Â½ Â“ÂŒÂŽÃ…ÂŽÂ–ÂŒÂ�Â‚Ã†Â•Ã„Â�Ã®Â•Ã±Â�HÂ�Ã¬Â‚ÃŒÂ�^Â‘ÂŠ' (in English, 'The truth of Toshiba COCOM affair and American information manipulation : The noise of Soviet's submarine was gone.') (1993) and I noticed US Commerce secretary Malcolm Baldrige claimed to Toshiba America President Nobuo Ishizaka Â�ÃŽÂ�Ã¢Â�MÂ—Y for the Toshiba-Kongsberg case on Jul 15, 1987 and he was killed as Toshiba Corp's mind-control terrorism like rodeo horse accident on Jul 25, 1987.<br><br>On Nov 15, 2006 I found the Yumi Shigemitsu - Toshiba trial case, http://homepage2.nifty.com/tsbrousai/ and http://kaitsbrousai.web.fc2.com. I watched the news without her name on newspaper before.<br>Ms Yumi Shigemitsu Â�dÂŒÃµÂ—RÂ”Ã¼ says she, Toshiba (R&amp;D?) employee in Toshiba Fukaya Factory Â“ÂŒÂŽÃ…Â�[Â’JÂ�HÂ�Ãª, got to be a depressive and went to a mental hospital from Apr 2001.<br>She says her co-workers 'O' and 'K' committed suiside on Jul 7, 2001 and on a day of Dec 2001.<br>Toshiba Corp really killed them as the mind-control terrorism before me ?<br>And she said Toshiba (Labor) Union didn't support her like Toshiba Corp's side against humanity therefore she asked Women's Union Tokyo Â�Â—Â�Â«ÂƒÂ†ÂƒjÂƒIÂƒÂ“Â“ÂŒÂ‹Âž to help. She also means Toshiba (Labor) Union is the same as Toshiba Group General Affairs Divisions or Toshiba-Ogikai Â“ÂŒÂŽÃ…Â�Ã®Â‰Ã¯.<br><br>I say to Japan, my family has no time rather than Yokota family in the North Korea's abduction case.<br>Yokota family knew North Korea unfairly makes abductee Megumi Yokota Â‰Â¡Â“cÂ‚ÃŸÂ‚Â®Â‚Ã� neurotic but under Toshiba Corp's mind-control my family can't even try to understand that Toshiba Corp unfairly makes me (Seitaro Kanamaru Â‹Ã ÂŠÃ›Â�ÂªÂ‘Â¾Â˜Y) neurotic. Rather, Yokota family's beginning might be Mar 1997 and from the beginning they might know North Korea's abduction was true.<br>The North Korea's abduction isn't a taboo (after Japan or Toshiba Corp mind-controlled Kim Jong Il Â‹Ã Â�Â³Â“Ãº by satellite N-Star-C on Sep 17, 2002).<br>It is also a big interruption for me that 'microwave mind-control technology is a taboo'.<br>On Jun 28, 2005 I gave Mr Shinzo Abe ÂˆÃ€Â”{Â�WÂŽO my letter on a street. But impossibly, if it's true that Mr Abe, not Toshiba Corp, has the power to lead the recapture of abductees from North Korea, honestly, I can't forgive that now PM Abe doesn't help me.<br><br>Greatly, President Bush changed Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. Mr Donald Rumsfeld, Chairman of General Instrument Corp, selected Toshiba Corp for America's ATSC system against US National Security.<br>And I really hope current Secretary of Defense Robert Gates hates Toshiba Corp 'the World's No. 1 terrorist for money'. 3 Toshiba Corp's current and future core business are all theft - important NAND Flash memory patent from Lexar Media Inc (USA), important SED TV patent from Nano-Proprietary Inc (USA) and maybe important Nuclear power system patent (for new ABWR AB1600) from General Electric Co (USA).<br>American people should recall and care Toshiba President Atsutoshi Nishida Â�Â¼Â“cÂŒÃºÂ‘Â� has an Iranian wife for Toshiba's Iran business. Naturally, Toshiba Corp can have supported Iran for Iranian nuke using many dummies. (I mean Toshiba Corp is a rogue also for the World rather than Iranian or North Korean administrations.)<br><br>- I really want strong US Rep Duncan Hunter, US Sen Richard Shelby, Mr Richard Perle, Mr William Triplett, kind US Sen Barbara Boxer and American agency to help me. I really want to be a refugee from Japan to America. -<br><br>- I hope you keep this for your brave justice and kindness. -<br><br>by Seitaro Kanamaru Â‹Ã ÂŠÃ›Â�ÂªÂ‘Â¾Â˜Y, a Japanese<br><span style="font-style: italic;">I am a Mind-Control Victim by Toshiba Corp since Nov 1997.<br>(My face is at http://www.discussanything.com/forums/showthread.php?p=838876.)<br>* My site in Japanese<br>http://jbbs.livedoor.jp/news/1301/ </span><br></div>
