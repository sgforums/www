Depending on the type of hole in the heart, the blood will travel from right to left or left to right.<br><br>With continuous left to right shunting of the blood, sooner or later, the blood flow will change its course from right to left because of a raised pressure in the pulmonary artery leading to a normal physiological constriction to protect the fragile pulmonary capillaries.<br><br>Such conversion is known as the Eisenmenger Syndrome...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So if the blood does not get into the pulmonary artery and hence into the lungs, the blood cells do not get oxygenated, instead it retains the carbon dioxide in the hemoglobin, which yields a bluish pigment and deposit towards certain area which one notices it as cyanosis...</div>

This is even worse during labor where the uterus has to contract at a great force to expel the baby out and when the placenta is retrieved, the bleeding will be often more severe as there is an autonomous regulation of blood flow back to your heart after constriction of all the blood vessels in the placenta (the placenta is an organ that has a lot of such blood vessels to feed your baby while in the womb).

In this condition, the valve may have shut it up (the foramen ovale). You can google it and have a look at the picture of how it looks like... You don't have to go for surgery, just go for a baseline check up on your heart... if it's too expensive, you can get it done in Malaysia...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
