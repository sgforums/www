The X-ray scanners at Changi Airport are not used to scan the hand luggage of passengers coming into Singapore. They are only used to scan the hand luggage of departing passengers.<br>As i said, Singapore customs did not check my hand luggage at all when i returned from Hongkong.<br><br>The turtle species i was referring to is the pig nosed turtle. It was recently listed under CITES II, hence its sale is restricted in Singapore. You need a licence to sell it here, but there are no restrictions on private ownership. It is classified as being 'Threatened', not 'Endangered'.<br><br>In Hongkong, the pignose is freely available for sale... in fact, many of them are kept in rather atrocious conditions in the fish shops. Some shops prepack them in small plastic bags and leave them under the sun. I'm sure many will perish if they are not sold quickly. I'll be doing the species a favour by buying it, bringing it home and providing it with a much better living environment.<br><br>And no, this cannot be 'another failed attempt by me' at smuggling... cos i have never attempted smuggling before.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Anyway i only want one for my fish tank, am not interested in becoming an importer for turtles... i got my own job to do.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
