            <div class='col-md body'>kiss01 posted yesterday (8 June 06) 10:55 AM :<br><br><blockquote>Really would appreciate ANY HELP, please please...<br><br>MISSING DOG.<br>My blur blur but beautiful dog went missing.<br>Anyone, please HELP if you see him!!! Pls call 9229 7375 URGENTLY if you spot him around KATONG or PARKWAY area.<br><br>Breed: Shetland Sheepdog<br>Colour: Mahogany Sable<br>Sex: Male<br>Markings: Has got a very beautiful full coat, runs with a slight gait, wearing a red collar but you might not be able to spot the collar cos his fur covers everything.. Responds to the name RU.<br><br>He's really timid &amp; shy, quite sheltered actually, and very attached to me. Follows me around the house and sleeps with me on my bed. I REALLY MISS HIM!!! Feel so bad &amp; guilty the whole thinking how i can lose him like that.. Really no mood to work at all.<br><br>I'm worried he might get run over by cars if he wander off to the busy roads. Have been searching for him since this morning 6am!!! And it looks like another rainy day today!!!<br><br><img src="http://www.myimghost.com/getimg/ru_cake.jpg"><br><br>I always walk him &amp; my other dog together, and sometimes I let him walk unleashed cos he's very obedient and obeys simple commands. This morning, I was walking them about 6am (still very dark), INSIDE the apartment building area (enclosed but has three open gates) and I let him offleash to stretch his legs a while.<br><br>I didnt see a cat crouching beside a prayer altar and the cat dashed directly in front of his nose. He got a shock &amp; gave chase and turned down a corner of one of the buildings (still inside the enclosed area). I was slowed down by my other dog who was crouching doing her business halfway. When I turned the corner, I couldnt find him and it was also still quite dark.<br><br>I spent more than two hours searching for him (inside the apartment area as well as along the route I always walked them from Katong SHopping Centre all the way to Marine Parade CC there) but couldnt find him. I worry someone might have found him &amp; kept him thats why he's unable to come back or else he might be frightened off by loud sounds / traffic cos he's quite a timid dog or he might be run over by traffic if he goes out to the main roads.<br><br>Hoping anyone who spots him to help call me. I've have posted on doggiesite &amp; pets.com.sg .. these are the only two pet forums i know of.. are there any other pet forums you can suggest? I would really appreciate it! the more ppl that sees my notice, the higher chances i find him back...<br><br>I went along Katong area frm Katong Shopping Centre to Katong Mall &amp; then cut across to Marine Parade area until the CC there.. No signs of him at all.. and my friend went in to one of the construction site canteen to look see...<br><br>I've have printed posters &amp; later after work going to marine parade police station. also called up spca already.<br><br>Anyone seen him, please please please contact <strong>9 229 7375</strong>. Really worried sick about him. Thanks a million everyone.</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>kiss01 posted an update :<br><br><blockquote><br><br>Thanks so much for the support &amp; help, everyone.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">kiss, any news on your pet yet ? Hope you find him really soon ! I lost my shetie before too and I know it feels really bad. </span><br><br>So far no news. I really fear he's been stolen and I wont ever get to see him again.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Did you manage to recover your sheltie? How did you do it? How long it took you? Is there any hope for me to find him again?</span><br><br>I've just printed 400 pieces more of the poster with clearer pic of him and will be putting into postbox of all the units at my place at Rose Garden as well as leaving on car windshield tonight.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Did you paste posters around the neighbourhood? Which part of Katong? </span><br><br>Posters left on bus stops around Katong Shopping Centre, Parkway, Katong Mall areas as well as on vacant walls. Was worried that I might get fined, so was choosing selective places to put only, but last night went home crying, so today I woke up thinking, what the heck, if I'm gonna get fined, might as well I make it worth it, so tonight gonna paste MORE POSTERS everywhere...<br><br>Hope everyone can help keep a lookout for me. Really miss my boy so much.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br></blockquote></div>
