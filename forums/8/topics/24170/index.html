            <div class='col-md body'>Shit aside.  While people are overwhelmed by ST propaganda, I wonder if anyone has read any papers on the possible danger of reclaimed water.  (Heck, some don't even know what reclaimed water means.  They thought its like reclaimed land - reclaimed from the sea! DOH!)<br><br>There are numerous elements (not even touching on compounds yet), more than those you can find on the periodic table, and even more are continuously being discovered, and as such not even the scientists can fully understand, much less neutralize any harmful effects from them.<br>This was one of the arguments put forward in a paper from a biochemist and Alzheimer's researcher at the Salk Institute, when San Diego was considering using reclaimed water.<br><br>People of the modern civilization have the most expensive piss in shit in the world.  Multi-vitamins, supplements.  Not to mention drugs, anti-pregnancy pills, and all the chemicals are passed out from their body.  Complication arises when all the different chemicals are all mixed together, causing mutations of molecular bonds, producing new compunds and chemicals of possibly unknown characteristics (now thats what i call NEWater).<br><br>While the effects may only show in the long term (like radiation), who knows if people will gradually end up impotent due anti-pregnancy chemicals in it.<br><br>As for the guys, LOL, certain chemicals act like estrogen (female hormones).  It was discovered that "numerous chemicals, including those in pesticides and plastics, are suspected estrogen mimics. In waters contaminated with such chemicals, male fish have taken on female characteristics. "</div>

I've watched some documentaries saying that there are even chemicals in the air that actually contains estrogen. These chemicals are the result of industralization, and it is slowly beginning to affect mankind!! This is part of the reason why female childbirth is increasing in comparison to male. There's one documentary that shows some baby crocs near some industralized zone having 2 sex, and even some human babies also have a weird in-between sex !!!

If we have the quantity, and there is demand, why not? This not only serves as a source of income for singapore but also means employing people. So in a sense, it will help our economy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My problem is very simple, and do not only pertain to reclaimed water.<br>Propaganda and blind faith, and of course excessive pride and arrogance that is uncalled for.<br><br>Currently, SG is paying $0.007 per 1000 gallons (3780 Litres of water) per day, and $0.63 to treat that amount of water.  For  simplicity, let's just say we are paying $1 per 3780-L of water.  And may i ask how much people are paying for a 500 ml bottle of  Evian water?  Even the new asking price of RM$0.60 for water from 2002 to 2007, and RM$3 from 2007 to 2011 is not that  ridiculous after working out the math.  Still, that is an asking price and thats what trade and NEGOTIATIONS are all about!   With tact, if both countries can offer incentives to each other, I don't see why the "package" won't work out.  Businesses  are always about mutual gains, and not a pissing game.<br>Ah... unless Newater is merely a tool to give Singapore a competitive edge in futher negotiations, while at the same time,  foster Nationalism among the blind sheep with all the propaganda.<br>Without M'sia, S'pore is still able to get water supply from indonesia or australia.  So why subject its citizens to  unneccessary risks?<br><br>Bottled reclaimed water Vs. Bottled DISTLLED water vs. Bottled mineral water?<br>Another GLC producing bottled water of our own national brand! That must be the one of the best business decisions ever!!!   Come buy our water with distinct taste of swimming pool, due to higher levels of chlorine!<br>And let's see another millions of dollars (the people's $, mind u), lost through GLCs.<br><br>To compare reclaimed water with conventional drinking water by comparing mineral content is not only simplistic but spastic  as well.  The bacterial content in sewage water is significantly higher, and higher levels of chlorine is needed.  Taste of  swimming pool water aside, chlorine can actually be detrimental to health, and THAT is why i raised the question of why only an  extremely small amount of chlorine is added to current treated water (too bad some people don't get it).  Of course, the amt  is added to kill most harmful organisms.  Most, but not all.  Even UV-rays treatment is not capable of killing off all  bacteria.<br><br>While our dear national paper ST, with the mission of "educating the public", reported that the U.S. has been reclaiming water  for more than 20 years, has it been mentioned that even until now, instead of drinking from the tap, most Americans buy  bottled water instead?  Even the poorest American i've met is refusing to drink from it, even though he is currently jobless  and on the verge of being homeless.<br><br>Frankly, I'm sick of the govt giving themselves credit when times are good, but push the blame to other countries when times  are bad.  So much for their foresight and "helicopter view".<br><br>All that I hear in response is simply<br>1) I don't wanna take any more shit from the other side, so i'm gonna drink my own shit.<br>So why should the others subject themselves to unnecessary risks?<br><br>2) Baseless accusations:  M'sia may have already been adding shit to the water all this time, so it doesn't make a  difference.<br><br>3) Best response award: "The govt say its safe, so it must be safe."<br>etc. etc. etc.<br><br>So much for all the conspiracy theories.<br>How about this for conspiracy:  The rich shall continue to drink bottled water, or cleaner water from certain reservoirs not tainted with reclaimed water, while  the rest of the poor suckers shall drink Newater, except that this time, they pay the govt for doing so. Ah, problem solved, and more $$$ rolls in too.<br>That said, theories will always be theories without substantial studies and evidence.<br>If #2 is true, that will probably show how negligent the authorities have been for not comparing bacterial content before  treatment.  But any idiot will know that the amount of chlorine added to treated water is pre-calculated based on the  bacterial content, unless of course again, the authorities don't give shit (pun intended).<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Delerium<br><br>Negotiation with the northern politician baboons, yeah right. We might reach an agreement with them now, but can anyone guarantee that few decades down the road, they will not come up with some hare-brained ideas that the price is again not as promising as before. Dependent on other countries for water is not a viable option either. As long as sg depends on other countries for water, the threat of them turning off our tap will always remain there.<br><br>I had lived in the states for close to a decade before coming back and I do have newater at where I was staying. And I have been drinking directly from the supply and there are no ill effects.<br><br>It is not difficult to see from your posting that newater issue is just an agenda for you to show your dissatisfaction with this govt. But what irks me are people like you who only complain and don't provide any solution. If I am unhappy with the purity level of my water supply, I get myself another filtering system. So what's the big deal about it? If you don't like the govt, form a political party and run for elections. If you don't like this country, then get out and go somewhere else. So for once, do something constructive and stop bitching about it. If it isn't for the present govt and her hardworking people, do you think you can enjoy the current standard of living? As sg progresses, so do people's expectation. It is perhaps your rising expectations that sowed your seeds of discontent.<br><br>"Ask not what this country can do for you, but what you can do for this country." JFK.<br><br>If you are in some backward and dry country, you will be lucky if you can get muddy water to drink. Bottomline, it is not about national pride or ego, but the opportunity to avoid a head on clash with the northern politician apes. Without the water issue as a tool for them to wield, at least there will be less noise from them.<br><br>Let me relate to you my experience when listening/ reading up experts' views. I have been to a few scientific conferences. The experts are no doubt well versed in their area of research. However, when presenting their findings, they will always bickered among each other. Why? Simple, everyone of them wants the world to know that their findings are the most accurate and they will do their utmost best to discredit researchers who show the opposite of their results. A good example will be fats. Some scientists said animal fat is more harmful but some others said that vegetable fats are worse. They claimed that vegetable fat will not break down as easily as animal fat. So who do you choose to believe?<br><br>Other than blaming all the bad economic woes on the govt, have it occurred to you that external factors beyond anyone's control do exist? Do you give the govt credit when times are good, and everyone has a job? No. Do you blame everything bad that happened on the govt? Yes. The govt is there to do their best to run this country and at times, they do hit a bad patch. Rather than doing our best to trample on her while she's down and bring more misery upon ourselves, we should work together and get sg and ourselves back to shape. And that is what I think is a true responsible citizen of any country. Sad to say, a high proportion of the younger generations does not think that way due to their affluent lifestyle since birth.<br><br></div>
