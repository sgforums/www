            <div class='col-md body'>Yea, I admit I'm overboard on this issue. Sorry for that. Ok, so I'm a punk too, but an old one.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>But I still think that you young people need to readjust your expectations. NS is not a time for you to earn $600-$800/month because you are basically nothing (yet)! You do not make any direct economic contributions, and yet your upkeep in the army costs tens of thousands every year/soldier. You cannot say the same of people who are working in private companies.<br><br>And during NS, how is it possible that you have insufficient amounts of money to spend? Unless you are talking about getting branded goods and gadgets, and cheonging everyday?  4 Weekends/month plus some nights off... Please don't say that $300-$500 is not enough. Bear in mind that you don't pay for rent or food. And if you consider the time when you are a student, please don't tell me that you are used to monthly allowances of $600-$800. If you can survive on a monthly allowance of $200 during your school years, why can't you do it during NS?<br><br>And those of you who still call SAF food shit - all those food are now catered by private catering companies. So please don't come and tell me you still have 'rubber band' noodles, 'rock-hard' rice and 'bouncy' meatballs. If you still call that kind of food shit, I think you should try what some farmers in China eat. And for god's sake, you don't even need to wash your mess tray now!!<br><br>Moose - yes, most govts give citizens subsidies, but when you consider the quantum of it, you must appreciate that the Singapore govt gives huge subsidies with respect to housing and education to EVERYONE. Talk about the US, and you have subsidies only for the poor. Talk about pensions and welfare states, you must understand that those people pay exorbitant amounts of tax that amounts to 50-60% of their pay! These young people are subsidising the old timers, and I think we should be glad that we are not doing this in Singapore. And I must point out that welfare state systems are prone to serious abuse. Even then, welfare is only given to a few people, unlike in the case of Singapore where subsidies are handed out to all except the richest people who insist on studying abroad and staying in private estates.<br><br>The chief reason why I blew my top (again I apologize for that), is that the younger people are asking for more and more and more. They do not put things in proper perspective, and they just want more! They call it human rights and what not! ha! Tell me what experience do they have with human rights?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bluerf do u know that SAf is paying $5 for each of our meals bvut what we are eating is not worth $5 at all.  It is more like $3 is put into the effort of preparing the food.  And since that is the case they might as well pay us the other $2 more per day.  Liddat at least we will feel more justified.<br><br>------------------<br>I dun wish to die i just wish for nasty people to die.</div>

Ok, so I'm a punk too, but an old one.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>But I still think that you young people need to readjust your expectations. NS is not a time for you to earn $600-$800/month because you are basically nothing (yet)! You do not make any direct economic contributions, and yet your upkeep in the army costs tens of thousands every year/soldier. You cannot say the same of people who are working in private companies.<br>[/quote]<br><br>Economic contribution,NSF do not contribute,but what about militarty contribution?Arn't the sweat,blood and tears shed worth at least an increment in pay?Not everything can be counted in dollars and cents.If the army spends so much on upkeep for eahc soldier,how about a few hundred increment more?I am not asking for 1 or 2 thousand more,but at least a few hundred more is reasonable at best?heehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><blockquote><br>And during NS, how is it possible that you have insufficient amounts of money to spend? Unless you are talking about getting branded goods and gadgets, and cheonging everyday?  4 Weekends/month plus some nights off... Please don't say that $300-$500 is not enough. Bear in mind that you don't pay for rent or food. And if you consider the time when you are a student, please don't tell me that you are used to monthly allowances of $600-$800. If you can survive on a monthly allowance of $200 during your school years, why can't you do it during NS?<br></blockquote>But now recruits are getting $240,not even $300,how to survive on $240?When you are a student,lotsa things are subsidised for tertiary education,that's why the dollar can be streched,but once you are in NS,you are considered gainfully employed and yet you are still getting $300 to $500(if you are lucky).Not all NSFs have subsidised food.i know some NSFs who are clerks and book out everyday,the transport is enough to take a large chunk of their so-called allowance away.<br><br><blockquote><br>And those of you who still call SAF food shit - all those food are now catered by private catering companies. So please don't come and tell me you still have 'rubber band' noodles, 'rock-hard' rice and 'bouncy' meatballs. If you still call that kind of food shit, I think you should try what some farmers in China eat. And for god's sake, you don't even need to wash your mess tray now!!<br></blockquote>Anyway,SAf pays SFI about $5 per meal and generally the meal standards are not worth $5,i can get even better food outside for less than that.We may not have rubber band noodles and rock hard rice,but we now have disgusting noodles and tasteless fried rice most of the time.There is no use comparing food in China with Singapore,the environment is different.A more reasonable comparison is outside hawker food and SFI food.China farmer food is not to be compared as the ingredient and their styles of cooking etc etc is different.So there is no basis for comparison,do you agree?<br><br><blockquote><br>Moose - yes, most govts give citizens subsidies, but when you consider the quantum of it, you must appreciate that the Singapore govt gives huge subsidies with respect to housing and education to EVERYONE. Talk about the US, and you have subsidies only for the poor. Talk about pensions and welfare states, you must understand that those people pay exorbitant amounts of tax that amounts to 50-60% of their pay!<br></blockquote>Our houses are subsidiesd,but we pay thru our noses and we practically empty our CPF just to repay back the loans.So the money is still going back to the government.you may not be an old timer now,but once you retire,you sure wish the government will take care of you instead of leaving you with your meagre CPF after paying for housing loans etc etc.<br><br><blockquote><br>These young people are subsidising the old timers, and I think we should be glad that we are not doing this in Singapore. And I must point out that welfare state systems are prone to serious abuse. Even then, welfare is only given to a few people, unlike in the case of Singapore where subsidies are handed out to all except the richest people who insist on studying abroad and staying in private estates.<br></blockquote>What wrong with subsidising our old folks who contributed to the nation,everyone grows old someday and don't you wish to be repaid for your efforts to the economy by having the government take care of you?I sure would,what about you?Education is subsidised to all in Singapore regardless of income.The rich have the same educational subsidy as the poor.True?Or does the government just weed out those richs kids and deny them all educational subsidy?eheh  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>[quote]<br>The chief reason why I blew my top (again I apologize for that), is that the younger people are asking for more and more and more. They do not put things in proper perspective, and they just want more! They call it human rights and what not! ha! Tell me what experience do they have with human rights?</div></blockquote>We are striving to be a developed nation and as a society progresses,it's natural to ask for more.After all this is how society progresses.Do you think irrigation would be popular if the average farmer just concentrated on farming his own plot of land just enough to feed his family?Of cos his desire to farm more lead to the popularity of irrigation.This is just to digress a bit.All in all,i am not asking for super welfare in the SAF where each recruit have a maid who runs the SOC for them,but at least a pay increment of a few hundred more than the status quo is reasonable,you think so?ehehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Theory Of Relativity<br>Eating a lot of good food will make 1 hour seem like 5 minutes while eating lotsa horrigible cooked veggies will make 5 minutes seem like 1 hour <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">~~~<br>Waiting for Diablo 2 Add-on <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Moose - ah... a fighter of words eh.      <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Knowing the disgruntled manner in which many NSFs perform their NS, I suggest you should use the 'contribution' line with caution. At any rate, we all know what happens during NS. NSFs (even reg) 'keng' and 'siam' whenever they can. Paying them a few hundred dollars more won't change that. Agree?<br><br>In addition, under what framework do you rate your military contributions? How does that translate to a justification for a raise of a few hundred dollars? Don't you people like to call SAF "S'pore Acting Force"? If that is the case, isn't your contributions a bit on the deficient side?<br><br>You mentioned a increase of a few hundred dollars would be insignificant since the SAF already pays so much on your upkeep. Lets just do some simple mathematics: $200 increment/NSFmonth X 12 months X 75,000 NSF = $180 million/year. With this kind of quantum, I hope you will change your mind on the 'insignificant'ness of the increment of a few hundred dollars. Furthermore, are you happy with just $200 more?      <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>You mentioned recruits getting $240/month. Did you know that during my time it was below $200? I past through that period with lots to spare and without taking a single cent from my parents. And now, I believe upon POP, you get $280/month. Talking about subsidies for tertiary students, I'm sure you'd agree that you actually have more living expenses to settle then. You still pay adult fare, food and clothings don't come any cheaper, etc. So, where does the stretching of money come in?<br><br>When you are in NS, you are given a special status of NSF. You are considered gainfully employed but not in the sense of doing a regular day job. In that case, you are not getting paid. Your allowance is not CPF payable. It is an allowance, so please do not compare it so! And for the NSFs who choose to book out everyday - its their choice! They didn't opt to stay in. If they did, I'm sure they will be given the same food and lodging.<br><br>If you really want to calculate effective pay, lets do it:<br><br>Allowance: $300 - $500<br>lodging:   $300 (consider renting a HDB room)<br>food:      $360 ($4 X 3 X 30)<br>Total:     $960 - $1160<br><br>As you can see it is roughly about what you can get with an 'A' level or Poly cert.<br><br>Coming to the food, I must say that the outside hawkers do not have to contend with the logistical nightmare of feeding a few thousand people three times a day everyday. As NSFs, the amount of food required is also incredibly high (we all know how much we can eat). So your $5 includes overheads and the extra portions of food you will not get outside. It is regrettable that the food does not compare with outside hawker food. My basis of comparison with China farmers is that we Singaporeans are way too pampered with good food! Not that we should all go eat like those poor people, but at least when we get slightly lower-quality food here, we are able to accept it with grace. Whatever happened to the soldier's ability to endure hardships?<br><br>Houses - why do we pay through our noses? Most probably because we do not match the house with our earning capabilities. So many people really want to 'live it up' in big houses and own cars. With those kind of expectations, I won't be surprised that people are paying through their noses. With that, how can we blame anyone else but our ownselves? We are not walking with 2 feet firmly planted on the ground.<br><br>You said you wanted the govt to take care of you - So does that mean you won't mind paying 30-40% more income tax *NOW*? Bear in mind that those extra taxes won't translate into cheaper houses, cars and life-style expenses for you *NOW*.<br><br>As to whats wrong with taking care of the elderly? Idealistically - Nothing. But if you go to the extent of paying full pensions, medical fees and whatnots, you are sure to get a lot of people who abuse the system. That is why we will never go into this kind of system. Public welfare drags the country down, and eventually everyone with it. You learn about this kind of things in public finance. The western countries are moving away from this system now because they now know its shortcoming; S'pore has no reason to go the other way!<br><br>Finally, your argument on how societies advance baffles me. Your argument seemed to bank on the fact that societies advance because people get paid more. That is absurd! People get paid more because they have progressed significantly with their skills and knowhow! And if you read through your posting, you have failed to justify why NSFs should get a few hundred dollars more. Your agruments just seemed to say:"hey, I'm getting too little, pay me more." In life, there is no free lunch; unless you are worth that much, you get only paid this much.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>[This message has been edited by BluErf (edited 30 January 2001).]</div>
