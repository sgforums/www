            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by BluErf:<br>[B]Moose - ah... a fighter of words eh.        <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Knowing the disgruntled manner in which many NSFs perform their NS, I suggest you should use the 'contribution' line with caution. At any rate, we all know what happens during NS. NSFs (even reg) 'keng' and 'siam' whenever they can. Paying them a few hundred dollars more won't change that. Agree?<br></blockquote>But what of those who do their work even if they hate it or complain about it?Hey,everywhere in this world,you will find people who keng and the SAF is no exception,but the bottomline is although they may complain,but they still get the work done rite?They may complain,but they still shed blood sweat and tears to get the job done right?So an increase to recognise the blood sweat and tears shed to get their work done is reasonable unless you think that the complaining and disgruntlement of the NSFs negate any increase in allowance?They will still do their work regardless of kenging or complaining.Isn't this contribution?<br><br><blockquote><br>In addition, under what framework do you rate your military contributions? How does that translate to a justification for a raise of a few hundred dollars? Don't you people like to call SAF "S'pore Acting Force"? If that is the case, isn't your contributions a bit on the deficient side?<br></blockquote><blockquote><br>You mentioned a increase of a few hundred dollars would be insignificant since the SAF already pays so much on your upkeep. Lets just do some simple mathematics: $200 increment/NSFmonth X 12 months X 75,000 NSF = $180 million/year. With this kind of quantum, I hope you will change your mind on the 'insignificant'ness of the increment of a few hundred dollars. Furthermore, are you happy with just $200 more?        <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></blockquote>180 million is only a small percentage of our GDP and since Singapore spends so much on defense,180 million more is ok.Anyway,the defense budget could be reduced and the money saved used on increasing the allowance of our NSFs as i have seen the amount of wastage that SAF produces each year and how much wastage is produced.All these could be reduced and the $$ saved usedto increase the allowance of ouur NSFs.<br><br><blockquote><br>You mentioned recruits getting $240/month. Did you know that during my time it was below $200? I past through that period with lots to spare and without taking a single cent from my parents. And now, I believe upon POP, you get $280/month. Talking about subsidies for tertiary students, I'm sure you'd agree that you actually have more living expenses to settle then. You still pay adult fare, food and clothings don't come any cheaper, etc. So, where does the stretching of money come in?<br></blockquote>Wrong,even as poly,you still get subsidies as poly student in form of transport,entertainment.In your time a bowl of noodles cost $1.50.Not $2 as it is now.There is no use comparing the money of yesteryear and today due to inflation.If you wanna compare,why don't you compare your $200 60 year ago when it could be a small fortune.Inflation increases the price of everything and your arguement of $200 when you were in NS fall flat due to inflation.<br><br><blockquote><br>When you are in NS, you are given a special status of NSF. You are considered gainfully employed but not in the sense of doing a regular day job. In that case, you are not getting paid. Your allowance is not CPF payable. It is an allowance, so please do not compare it so! And for the NSFs who choose to book out everyday - its their choice! They didn't opt to stay in. If they did, I'm sure they will be given the same food and lodging.<br></blockquote>Not every place where there are NSFs will there be a proper place to stay in.MINDEf is a place where there are NSFs and there is no place for NSF clerks to sleep in properly unless they want to sleep on chairs and no proper meals unless they want to eat their own cup noodles.An allowance does not have to remain at a fixed amount,but can be increased to a more reasonable amount<br><br><blockquote><br>If you really want to calculate effective pay, lets do it:<br><br>Allowance: $300 - $500<br>lodging:   $300 (consider renting a HDB room)<br>food:      $360 ($4 X 3 X 30)<br>Total:     $960 - $1160<br><br>As you can see it is roughly about what you can get with an 'A' level or Poly cert.<br><br>Coming to the food, I must say that the outside hawkers do not have to contend with the logistical nightmare of feeding a few thousand people three times a day everyday. As NSFs, the amount of food required is also incredibly high (we all know how much we can eat). So your $5 includes overheads and the extra portions of food you will not get outside. It is regrettable that the food does not compare with outside hawker food. My basis of comparison with China farmers is that we Singaporeans are way too pampered with good food! Not that we should all go eat like those poor people, but at least when we get slightly lower-quality food here, we are able to accept it with grace. Whatever happened to the soldier's ability to endure hardships?<br></blockquote>Your calculation is not really correct as most your people do not rent a flat or a room,but rather stay with their parents.You can name 1 person who does that and i can name 10 more who stay with their parents.Also,the basic entry pay for a poly or A level is 1.5 to 1.6 k,it could be more for some other disciplines.I have friends getting 2k with just a diploma.The $5 is spent on overheads and extra prortions of food?Outside hawker centers also have overheads and i get the same portion of food from a hawker stall as i get from SFI and it's even cheaper and better.I can only get exta portion of food from SFI and that is only if the auntie is in a good mood which is not often.Outside hawker centers also have logistic stuff to worry about,but their quality of food is better than SFI,care to explain?A soldier's harship does not apply to food as food can make or break a soldier's morale.As Napoleon have quoted "An army marches on it's stomach".If i get lousy food when fighting a war,i will lose morale too.What about you?<br><br><blockquote>Houses - why do we pay through our noses? Most probably because we do not match the house with our earning capabilities. So many people really want to 'live it up' in big houses and own cars. With those kind of expectations, I won't be surprised that people are paying through their noses. With that, how can we blame anyone else but our ownselves? We are not walking with 2 feet firmly planted on the ground.<br></blockquote>You seen the prices of a 4 room or even a 3 room flat lately?The price is quite shocking.Not everyone wants to own a car and car does not come into the topic as cars are expensive due to COE and nothing else.But houses leh,don't you agree that housing price have increased way more than inflation a few years ago?Now even ordinary people trying to get a small average HDB flat are struggling.Not everyone is trying to live it up,some are just trying to survive from hand to mouth.But this out of the topic of Ns allowances.don't you agree.<br><br><blockquote><br>You said you wanted the govt to take care of you - So does that mean you won't mind paying 30-40% more income tax *NOW*? Bear in mind that those extra taxes won't translate into cheaper houses, cars and life-style expenses for you *NOW*.<br></blockquote>There is no need to lose your temper in terms of using caps as an angry person won't think clearly.Cheapers cars are not part of the issue as the reason why they are expensive is due to COE and nothing else.But those extra taxes i pay if they mean i will get taken care of by the government in terms of free medical and stuff when i am old.I don't mind paying.I am not asking for cheapers cars,housing as of now,but for the government to take care of it's old folks when they retire as i have said earlier,Is this too much to ask?ehehe   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><blockquote><br>As to whats wrong with taking care of the elderly? Idealistically - Nothing. But if you go to the extent of paying full pensions, medical fees and whatnots, you are sure to get a lot of people who abuse the system. That is why we will never go into this kind of system. Public welfare drags the country down, and eventually everyone with it. You learn about this kind of things in public finance. The western countries are moving away from this system now because they now know its shortcoming; S'pore has no reason to go the other way!<br></blockquote>Every system is bound to get abused and there is no abuse free system.A welfare system can be implemented with checks and measures and i am not asking for a welfare system to be implemented without any form of checks,but to just implement it cautiously.But this is digressing out of topic with regards to NSF allowance,ehehe   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><blockquote><br>Finally, your argument on how societies advance baffles me. Your argument seemed to bank on the fact that societies advance because people get paid more. That is absurd! People get paid more because they have progressed significantly with their skills and knowhow! And if you read through your posting, you have failed to justify why NSFs should get a few hundred dollars more. Your agruments just seemed to say:"hey, I'm getting too little, pay me more." In life, there is no free lunch; unless you are worth that much, you get only paid this much.<br><br>Thank you.<br></blockquote>You seemed to have skimmed thru my posting as i have said that in lieu of the various contributions to the SAF by NSFs,an increment is not that unreasonable,do you want me to show you where i said it or you wish to read my posting carefully again?Pay increment is not only due to increase of skillsand knowledge,but also inflation,You seem to forget that.Thanx<br><br>------------------<br>Theory Of Relativity<br>Eating a lot of good food will make 1 hour seem like 5 minutes while eating lotsa horrigible cooked veggies will make 5 minutes seem like 1 hour  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">~~~<br>Waiting for Diablo 2 Add-on  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>[This message has been edited by moose (edited 30 January 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Moose - 1st thing 1st - using the caps with asterisks does not equate to losing temper. It is used to accentuate the words so that they grab your attention.<br><br>I read your argument quite carefully. In fact, I was reading paragraph by paragraph as I typed my rebuttal, so no need to harp on me skimming thru your reply. In fact, since you say that you have made some major arguments on the pay increment, pls do highlight it to me in a quoted reply.<br><br>I'd like to point out that you have not tackled my argument of: "what framework do you use to rate your military contributions? How does that translate into a justification for a raise of a few hundred dollars?" Your main point seemed to be 'blood and sweat'. Hey, a school rugby player sees a lot of 'blood and sweat' too. So what's your point again?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I am surprised at the way you feel about Singapore's GDP spending. No doubt $180 million is a small % of our GDP, but to spend such amounts just on one economically unproductive field warrants serious consideration. Supposed you do get the increment, the total sum spent on NSF's allowances alone will hit $600-$700 million. Doesn't it occur to you that such sums are astronomical? Ok, so Singapore is very rich now, but that does not warrant spending its surpluses in ways that benefit a small portion of the population in the short-term.<br><br>As to the time I received $180/month as a recruit, it was a mere 6 years ago. Given singapore's low inflation, I think the comparison is valid. Don't forget you now have a 33% increase to $240/month.<br><br>As for Mindef NSFs who stay out, might I ask how many of you are actually Mindef staff? Very few rite? In the later part of my NS life, I stayed out. But I never found myself lacking in money - I need only $50/week max, and most of the time, I get to save up some to get my discmans and whatnots now and then. What I can tell you is that I don't own much branded stuff or eat in fancy restaurants much. Ring any bells?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Ok, so most people do stay with their parents, but please bear in mind that staying-in is a necessity for an army to operate reasonably. Imagine everyone going home everyday - whats going to happen during night exercises and night range? Its unfortunate that most NSFs have to stay in, and as long as they stay in, Rent should be computed as part of effective pay.<br><br>As for the SFI food, please do appreciate the fact that hawkers do not provide food for anywhere near the number of people in the Army. Overheads for such huge logistical operations are killers, I can assure you. Hawkers - what they sell in a day you can see in the display glass or small fridge behind.<br><br>As for pay - please note that I have not computed everything into the effective pay, so don't be surprised that they are more items in it.<br><br>Hardships do not apply to food. Really? Then what does? If our soldiers lose morale so easily over SFI food, then I say our soldiers have gone too soft.<br><br>About the houses - it is a fact that our public housing compares very favourably to other major cities. The reason why prices jumped in the past few years was because of *GREED* on the part of Singaporeans. So many people are speculating on properties, including HDB flats! But at any rate, I don't see how a middle-class family can be struggling to buy a 4 or 5-room flat unless they are financing a whole slew of other expenses such as club memberships, cars and luxury items. Please don't tell me you were referring to the poor families, because Singapore is extremely middle-class heavy.<br><br>I think you don't get what I'm trying to say with cars. I don't mean subsidising cars using higher taxes. I mean that by being subject to higher taxes, prices of cars will remain the same, as will the prices of flats. My point is that you will be worse off with higher taxes.<br><br>And as to what is wrong with asking the govt to take care of the elderly - In the perfect world, nothing is wrong. In the real world, we know the system will breed overdependence on the part of the people. It will result in abuse of the systems of which no checks have ever being effective enough. I urge you to go study the welfare systems in the Western country to find out what exactly is wrong. I myself did a research project on this area, tying the Western experience to the local context. So please don't argue with me on this one.<br><br>As for digressing - I thought you were the one who 1st brought up the elderly issue?<br><br>And one last point, I have a phrase for you to think about:"Give an inch, ask for a foot".<br><br>PS: you seemed to be the one losing your temper, esp in the reply to shogun. Your sarcasm amuses me.<br><br>Deathwish, why dun u join in and argue for your stance? No point cheering Moose on, and you yourself have nothing better to say.<br><br>[This message has been edited by BluErf (edited 31 January 2001).]</div>

They feel that they have suffer before so they wants younger generation to suffer with them. They don't know the world is constant improving. There is only one word to describe them. And that is selfish. They themself think they can do it without so they demand everybody to do it also.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To make your NIGHTMARES WORSE... Before I ORD I actually heard that there would some kinda adjustments make to your salary for the fact that you have been contributing to your country for the 2.5 years and they APPRECIATES that!!!<br>But GUESS WHAT...? My HR manager is a WOMAN and she DON'T BELIEVE in whatever NS craps we did and she thinks it's our own BASHA... She SUCK UP my adjustments during an annual increment and pay adjustment... A female colleague who joined us half a year later as a fresh graduate actually gets the same pay as me..... Imagine the increment and kinda pay I should be getting now if NOT for the fact that I was serving my NS instead of working...<br>And WORSE to come... I ever wrote a letter to MINDEF regarding the matter as I've read from their documents that we (NS guys) DESERVE the adjustment for the FACT that we served our nations... BUT... The REPLY I got from MINDEF was PAINFUL... They said they can ONLY ENCOURAGE the employers to give us adjustments and not really do anything about it or it would affect the economy of Singapore... F**k the ECONOMY... What about OUR OWN ECONOMY...??? Why not they say they can ONLY ENCOURAGE us to serve NS and NOT FORCE us to serve NS...???<br>So GUYS... If you think you're actually BAD ENOUGH... It's time to WAKE UP your IDEAS....<br><br>------------------<br>ÃŸe COOL, NOT sÂ¢rrÂ¥....</div>
