            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by BluErf:</div><div class="quote_body">Yea, I admit I'm overboard on this issue. Sorry for that. Ok, so I'm a punk too, but an old one.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>But I still think that you young people need to readjust your expectations. NS is not a time for you to earn $600-$800/month because you are basically nothing (yet)! You do not make any direct economic contributions, and yet your upkeep in the army costs tens of thousands every year/soldier. You cannot say the same of people who are working in private companies.<br><br>And during NS, how is it possible that you have insufficient amounts of money to spend? Unless you are talking about getting branded goods and gadgets, and cheonging everyday?  4 Weekends/month plus some nights off... Please don't say that $300-$500 is not enough. Bear in mind that you don't pay for rent or food. And if you consider the time when you are a student, please don't tell me that you are used to monthly allowances of $600-$800. If you can survive on a monthly allowance of $200 during your school years, why can't you do it during NS?<br><br>And those of you who still call SAF food shit - all those food are now catered by private catering companies. So please don't come and tell me you still have 'rubber band' noodles, 'rock-hard' rice and 'bouncy' meatballs. If you still call that kind of food shit, I think you should try what some farmers in China eat. And for god's sake, you don't even need to wash your mess tray now!!<br><br>Moose - yes, most govts give citizens subsidies, but when you consider the quantum of it, you must appreciate that the Singapore govt gives huge subsidies with respect to housing and education to EVERYONE. Talk about the US, and you have subsidies only for the poor. Talk about pensions and welfare states, you must understand that those people pay exorbitant amounts of tax that amounts to 50-60% of their pay! These young people are subsidising the old timers, and I think we should be glad that we are not doing this in Singapore. And I must point out that welfare state systems are prone to serious abuse. Even then, welfare is only given to a few people, unlike in the case of Singapore where subsidies are handed out to all except the richest people who insist on studying abroad and staying in private estates.<br><br>The chief reason why I blew my top (again I apologize for that), is that the younger people are asking for more and more and more. They do not put things in proper perspective, and they just want more! They call it human rights and what not! ha! Tell me what experience do they have with human rights?</div></blockquote>Hi BluErf,<br>I, for one, am what you'll call the younger people. With regard to your last sentence, i'd like to rebuke by pointing out that nowadays most enlistees do have education of at least a dip. or A's. Naturally, they'll tend to ask for more, or maybe it's their entitlement.<br><br>Just my 2 cents.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all!<br><br>Sorry for the long absence... really busy lately.<br><br>Ok, Moose, I think there is little point in arguing with you because you just won't buy my argument, or anyone else's for that matter.<br><br>For the $180 million, it is simply the 'increment' amount. The $700 million is the current amount plus the increment amount. Hey, I didn't think I write that badly as to be incomprehesible, did I?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>U still don't understand what I'm trying to say with cars... but nevermind. As for the arguments on houses, if you really want to bring in the poor people living in 1-room flats, what can I say... haha!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> And for $300, u said u could get a small flat? The last I heard from friends renting rooms from people in Jurong West, they were paying $300 per month, and usually, they share it with a friend too. Going by space per person, I don't see how different it can be from a big bunk with more people.<br><br>And finally, I commend you on your dripping sarcasm on the issue of food again...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> OK, that's all - end of discussion for me. U guys can go tresh it out.<br><br>PS: for the guy who pointed out that most people now at least have poly or A level cert, I have only this to say - "entitlement" is a bad word to use in life. Are people even "entitled" to living? Sometimes fate says no... If that is so, what more can we say about NS allowance?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

I'm a stay-out personnel since my BMT. From my house to the camp, I have to take 2 bus service and MRT, which will cost me app. $3.50 per day (2-ways trips) which means about $84 per month. And that means I have only about $195 remaining per month ($279.20 - $84).
