From what I heard, there are 2 types of targets.<br><br>1) Sales quota per month is 3 times their annual salary. Therefore, if one earns 2K per month, his monthly quota will be 72K.<br><br>2) Dunno if it's true but I do heard that some banks require them to bring in "sales" of 1million per month!<br><br>If you cannot meet target for 3 consecutive months, you will be asked to leave. Of course, once you exceed quota, you get commissions. Can bank RMs enlighten us? I would like to know which one reflects the truth better.</div>

Not mentioning which one, but of those that has a strong presence here as well.<br><br>They have a basic salary, ard $2500 + handphone allowance  + taxi vouchers + entertainment expense.<br><br>They need to rake up sales according to what their managers set for them ( if they are rookie, high performer or ppl who need to work on their sales etc) usually it will be ard $30,000 to $80,000 per mth.<br><br>Usually its achieveable as they have a existing set of portfolio for them to work on. So its kinda of selling new products and services to the clients.<br><br>Payouts are by quaterly basis. If you been a consistent worker and smooth talker, a mthly average of ard $5000 to $8000(taking into account the quaterly payout) is usually possible before CPF.<br><br>The rewards are high no doubt, but so are the pressure to make u perform. 3 mths is the norm the grace period they will allow anyone not performing to pull up their socks.Usually once your out, you out of the entire banking business.<br><br>A diploma at least, relevant studies in BnF is gd, but quick wits and being street wise will get you further<br><br>Gd Luck !</div>
