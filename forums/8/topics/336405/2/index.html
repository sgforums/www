              <p>i think the problem here is not with malaysians. its with the freaking immigration policies as a whole.</p>
              <p>with local unemployment on the rise (now esp so with DBS retrenching 900ppl), it is plain dumb to continue encouraging FT and foreign workers to flood into our country.</p>
              <p>they reap the benefits (by getting a job here, which is better than no job back home), while singaporeans suffer (jobs being snatched by the former).</p>
              <p>there should be more protectionism, protecting the rights of singaporeans.</p>
              <p>singaporeans are the one who paid taxes, defend the country etc. it is just right to see that we are recognised for our sacrifices.</p>
              <p>what's the point in having a high employment rate, if all those who are employed are foreigners, while all singaporeans are sleeping on the streets? we are not just statistics and figures. ppl have local families to support, where the upkeep is much higher.foreigners only have themselves to support in singapore, plus a family back home where upkeep is much lower.</p>
              <p>FT can survive on a $1000 salary. but for a singaporeans, a family of 4 will starve to death on a $1000 salary. it is not about the quantity of jobs which ppl wants. ppl also want a decent quality of job, where the pay is enough to support their family.</p>
              <p>so the best solution is to severely restrict immigration, until there's a real need for more foreign workers. currently, there's a labour surplus of local singaporeans, which is not good for the economy.</p>
              <p>and to toyota, yes, Malaysians PR only need to serve NS ONLY if he's a second generation PR. most Malaysians at the work place came as a first generation PR, so they dunid to do NS.</p>
              <p>they come to study in singapore unis, paying roughly the same tuition fees as locals.</p>
              <p>for first generation PRs, they don't even have to serve any bond or to do NS.</p>

              <p>lol...how true...<br> i think many sporeans think of jobs as a just another thing you do
                      for money...<br> i think of profession as something you do becoz you want to do it
                      and not becoz you can do it or becoz you have to do it...thus
                      putting pride in one's work...</p>

              <p>because sporeans mostly can only get job for money and nothing else, their boss only see them as labour who can easily be replace.</p>
              <p>its had to be professional in your job if there's little respect in it. our local culture i guess? no money no respect.</p>
              <p>the prc part is too much for me, given a choice i rather they try to lure malaysians to sg than prc. i'm not totally against PRCs but to see them in everywhere i go is really too much, i can leave my house and buy a drink from a prc at jollibean on the way to the mrt or if i'm taking a bus instead my driver's a prc, dinner's probably at a food court/restaurant staffed by prc, i have to face them during work(thankfully not as co workers)</p>

              <p><br>remember the news about how 100+ foreign construction workers were denied their wages, and were fired for no reason? do u call that a "shortage of labour"?</p>
              <p>also, once the IR is completed, where would these construction workers go? they are essentially temporary workers. the construction industry in singapore is a matured sunset industry. even if u want to be a construction worker, u may not even find long term tenure at a construction company.</p>

              <p>Depends on whether there are enough citizens who are capable and willing to take up the jobs in the first place. It is because not enuff citizens willing or able to take up the jobs, employers have to look elsewhere.</p>
              <p>It is the survival of the fittest here. Not about nationality. If you are capable, then you will be able to get a job easily even if you have other Malaysians vying for your job.</p>
