              <p><br>don't blame you for that, but don't generalise. because the majority are high caste, high caste indians have the most access to india's wealth and resource. hence they are better educated. this high caste are a meagre population, they are the only non residential indians that were'nt sent to other countries by british. hence they look down on everyone including indians. I share your sentiments.</p>

              <p>basically, i can say:</p>
              <p>1) Malaysian guys are indeed cocky and arrogant, mainly those
              working in white-collared jobs. Those working in blue-collared jobs
              are like totally different breed altogether and i respect them for
              that.</p>
              <p>2) Malaysian chicks quite nice and sweet / innocent in
              personality, and considered pretty face-wise lah....the pretty ones
              really pretty like fark. Makes you regret why you're born in
              SG.</p>
              <p>3) ummm.....Malaysian accent is really funny sometimes. LOL, no
              offense, but certain msians have a much thicker accent than others.
              i don't think SGreans have accents.....our accents are
              monotoned.</p>
              <p>4) i fully agree with what Deathspark says earlier, about the
              immigration problem and how people from China, Viet etc are
              flooding in and over-numbering the locals. FT is good but there
              must be a limit and the gahmen must watch it closely and calculate
              long-term problems. At this rate it's going, it'll soon be 10
              foreigners vs. 1 Singaporean in a population of every 100
              people.</p>
              <p>The gahmen seems very obsessed with hiring every single FT they
              can find.</p>

              <p>I'm Malaysian so let me give my two cents on this.</p>
              <p>TS's sentiments is very common anywhere in the world. But I think this sentiment is particularly strong in Singapore cos the government here has a very foreigner-friendly policy and many locals feel their jobs (and even partners!) are taken away. I worked a three-month internship in an engineering firm. Discrimination? You bet. The funny thing was the SG guys didn't really like the Msian guys but they were head over heels over the Msian girls! :P</p>
              <p>So although I'm not local, I support the idea that the Government should increase the job and education opportunities for locals. It's the only right thing to do. As Elindra said, we've got a whole load of BS to deal with in our own country but our government will never place other people before us.</p>
              <p>Anyway in case you didn't know..most (if not all) Singapore's Chief Justice's hail from Malaysia. Lee Kuan Yew's first cabinet had half its ministers having Malaysian origin. SG's first DPM was also from Malaysia. The current health minister was also from Penang. So if TS doesn't like us, he's got to remember we helped build SG too.</p>
              <p>Or perhaps TS had some bad experiences with Malaysian colleagues..of course there are definitely Malaysians whom I can't stand. But bad people are everywhere.</p>

              <p>I'm Malaysian so let me give my two cents on this.</p>
              <p>TS's sentiments is very common anywhere in the world. But I
              think this sentiment is particularly strong in Singapore cos the
              government here has a very foreigner-friendly policy and many
              locals feel their jobs (and even partners!) are taken away. I
              worked a three-month internship in an engineering firm.
              Discrimination? You bet. The funny thing was the SG guys didn't
              really like the Msian guys but they were head over heels over the
              Msian girls! :P</p>
              <p>So although I'm not local, I support the idea that the
              Government should increase the job and education opportunities for
              locals. It's the only right thing to do. As Elindra said, we've got
              a whole load of BS to deal with in our own country but our
              government will never place other people before us.</p>
              <p>Anyway in case you didn't know..most (if not all) Singapore's
              Chief Justice's hail from Malaysia. Lee Kuan Yew's first cabinet
              had half its ministers having Malaysian origin. SG's first DPM was
              also from Malaysia. The current health minister was also from
              Penang. So if TS doesn't like us, he's got to remember we helped
              build SG too.</p>
              <p>Or perhaps TS had some bad experiences with Malaysian
              colleagues..of course there are definitely Malaysians whom I can't
              stand. But bad people are everywhere.</p>

              <p>Nobody cares if the old ministers born before 1960s were from Malaysia or SG because there was little to no distinction between Malayan-born and Singapore-born then. Both were under British rule anyway, and personally both were seen as ONE land, so it doesn't matter.</p>
              <p>It's the current generation that's feeling peeved. It's too easy to tell locals to 'compete'. Meritocracy can only take place in an equal footing, but how can you compare FTs who are desperate to work to feed their families at any rate and locals who cannot work on the cheap because they are desperate to feed their families?</p>
              <p>Personally, TS should probably target his foreigner hatred on two most populous nations because Malaysians have been here for long, occupying every strata of the socio-economic ladder, so Msians cannot be considered 'snatching' jobs. The higher-level Msians usually stay here, be PRs and CONTRIBUTE to CPF and other govt fund-raising schemes. The two populous nations' citizens will just run to Aussie and US/UK with the right chance, after getting jobs and scholarships.</p>
              <p>Ironic that these people despise being here so much but love to use their singapore experience to boost their CV.</p>
              <p>For some reason, this scenario reminds me of the scene in 'I Not Stupid' where the fat bespectacled boy got bullied in his own home. Maybe the fat boy is an allegory to something else?</p>
              <p>BTW, to CR, u sure they won't forsake their own people? Think of the Indons who's got bumi status and that includes those red IC-cum-MyKad holders. And think of the Chinese and Indians....'nuff said.</p>
              <p>But considering that M'sian Chinese are not seen as Malaysians by BN, then you are right about not forsaking its "own people" :P</p>

              <p>I think you need to check up your history again.</p>
              <p>Singapore used to belong to the Johor Sultanate.  The British bought/conned Singapore out of it.  Question of ownership was settled on 2nd August 1824.  Malaysia did not exist at that time, neither was the Johore Sultanate part of it.  So Singapore <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NEVER</span></span></span> belonged to Malaysia. </p>
              <p>Its one thing to say that Malays were native inhabitants of this island, but to say that it belonged to Malaysia is totally off the mark.</p>
