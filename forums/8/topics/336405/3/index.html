              <p>i think the problem here is not with malaysians. its with the freaking immigration policies as a whole.</p>
              <p>with local unemployment on the rise (now esp so with DBS retrenching 900ppl), it is plain dumb to continue encouraging FT and foreign workers to flood into our country.</p>
              <p>they reap the benefits (by getting a job here, which is better than no job back home), while singaporeans suffer (jobs being snatched by the former).</p>
              <p>there should be more protectionism, protecting the rights of singaporeans.</p>
              <p>singaporeans are the one who paid taxes, defend the country etc. it is just right to see that we are recognised for our sacrifices.</p>
              <p>what's the point in having a high employment rate, if all those who are employed are foreigners, while all singaporeans are sleeping on the streets? we are not just statistics and figures. ppl have local families to support, where the upkeep is much higher.foreigners only have themselves to support in singapore, plus a family back home where upkeep is much lower.</p>
              <p>FT can survive on a $1000 salary. but for a singaporeans, a family of 4 will starve to death on a $1000 salary. it is not about the quantity of jobs which ppl wants. ppl also want a decent quality of job, where the pay is enough to support their family.</p>
              <p>so the best solution is to severely restrict immigration, until there's a real need for more foreign workers. currently, there's a labour surplus of local singaporeans, which is not good for the economy.</p>
              <p>and to toyota, yes, Malaysians PR only need to serve NS ONLY if he's a second generation PR. most Malaysians at the work place came as a first generation PR, so they dunid to do NS.</p>
              <p>they come to study in singapore unis, paying roughly the same tuition fees as locals.</p>
              <p>for first generation PRs, they don't even have to serve any bond or to do NS.</p>
