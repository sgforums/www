            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: auto 0cm; text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">This is a story which I feel is necessary to share with you guys, in the effort to protect our consumers’ rights. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: auto 0cm; text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">My friend and I were shopping at Heeren one day. We walked passed a shoe shop named “Mimim*m*”. A shoe caught my attention and I decided to give it a try. It fitted well so I decided to purchase it. However, the one on display was the last piece. I usually don’t mind buying displayed items but not this one in particular. This was because the shoes I wanted to buy were white in colour but due to weeks of display, there was a colour contrast between the left and the right.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: auto 0cm; text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I returned the pair of shoes to the salesgirl and was about to take my leave, when suddenly the salesgirl suggested to check stocks with another store at Far East Plaza. I was then told that the other store named “Trendy XXXX” had the size I wanted and it was a new pair. The salesgirl advised me to make immediate payment so that she could get Trendy XXXX to reserve the shoes for me. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: auto 0cm; text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I nodded with thanks and paid $25.90 for my purchase. It was 8.45pm after movie @ Cineleisure. My friend and I quickly headed down to Far East Plaza to collect my shoes as the store will be closing at 9.30pm. Weather was bad as it was drizzling. It took us some effort to arrive at our destination. My friend collected the shoes for me but realised that the workmanship was bad and it looked rather old. He feedback to the boss but was told that such condition is normal. Well, the boss’s intention was pretty clear right?! The shoes were collected in exchange for my receipt. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: auto 0cm; text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Upon exiting the store, my friend noticed that the same pair of shoes I purchased was actually selling at $19.90. It was astonishingly GROSS! Below are some of my views:</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: auto 0cm auto 36pt; text-indent: -18pt; text-align: justify; "><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">1.</span><span style='font: 7pt "Times New Roman";'>       </span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Since I was collecting the shoes at Trendy XXXX, the salesgirl at Mimim*m* should be kind enough to inform me that the former is selling at a much cheaper price. Any consumer would want to pay at a lower price for the same quality and design, especially knowing that you will ultimately self collecting at the other store. This questions the integrity of the salesgirl and I felt my consumer’s rights being abused.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: auto 0cm auto 36pt; text-indent: -18pt; text-align: justify; "><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">2.</span><span style='font: 7pt "Times New Roman";'>       </span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I consulted a few friends and they unanimously feel I should request for a refund for the difference. I did some thinking and concluded that it would be futile. First, Trendy’s boss saw the price on my receipt but has intentionally refused to make any comments. This again, questions his integrity. His intention was clear. Thus, by asking for a refund, it’s as good as slapping myself. It would just create an ugly scene and answers would still be “NO NO NO!”. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: auto 0cm auto 36pt; text-indent: -18pt; text-align: justify; "><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">3.</span><span style='font: 7pt "Times New Roman";'>       </span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Some friends suggested that I return to Mimim*m* to ask for refund. However, the fact that since both stores are owned by the same boss, would it make any difference? </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: auto 0cm auto 36pt; text-indent: -18pt; text-align: justify; "><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">4.</span><span style='font: 7pt "Times New Roman";'>       </span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Lastly, the thought of paying much more for the same standard and the fact that we rushed down to self collect in the drizzle really made our shopping experience a bad one. If I was able to self collect at Mimim*m* without the need to travel, maybe I would have felt better.</span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: auto 0cm auto 36pt; text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The entire experience sucks. As a consumer, I have low tolerance for dishonesty. I believe I have every right to know what kind of service I’m paying for. <span> </span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: auto 0cm auto 36pt; text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Lesson learnt: Salespeople would coerce you to make payment first. Don’t trust them too easily unless he/she is a friend of yours. Always try to make payment only when you get to see the final product. Hope this could help maximise your shopping experience. =)</span></span></p>

              <p>much as i sympathise with your experience, let's look at it from the shopkeeper's perspective. Going through your points :</p>
              <p>1) Just as every consumer would want to pay the least possible for an item, the objective of a salesman is to sell it for the highest possible price. Just because your incentives are not aligned does not mean the salesgirl was being unethical. Besides, being a salesgirl at the first outlet probably meant she did not know the same item was priced lower at the second one. You may feel ripped off, but you did pay the amount you were willing to pay. No one pulled a fast one on you.</p>
              <p>2) You already paid for the item, yes. On that count, you cannot actually ask for a refund just because it's sold cheaper somewhere else(the second store). BUT, you really should have gone back in and raised hell over the condition of your shoes. They did not scam you over price, but they certainly did on quality. Insist on a refund unless you get a pristine pair. It IS what you paid for. Also, never hand over the entire receipt in lieu of item collection. Insist they make out a new one, in case the item turns out defective.</p>
              <p>3) You cannot ask for a refund because you already bought the shoes. You can, however insist on a replacement pair. While it most likely would make no difference in your case(you have no receipt, time has passed and you have no hard evidence), your complaint could make a difference to how they treat their next customer.</p>
              <p>4) There is nothing wrong with charging you more for a identical item. It is in no way unethical or illegal. As a consumer, the onus is on you to shop around for the best deal. No shopkeeper is going to voluntarily slash prices because they aren't the cheapest around. As such, nothing the staff at the first store, Mimim*m*, did was wrong. Any disapproval on your part should be directed at the boss of that second store, for giving you a substandard product.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hey Ohboy, thanks for the reply man! In fact, I was rather angry by the fact that I need to self collect the shoes from the other store which is selling at much lower price. I mean.... since I was made to travel that far, I shd be fed with the correct info. My perception upon payment was that both stores selling the same price. That's why one store could get stocks from the other. That was also why i willingly forked out the money as that was the kind of expectation i was paying for and not likewise. I was on the verge of leaving the store when the salesgirl stopped me. If not, I would have more time to shop ard and probably spotted better prices. Looks like it was just another unlucky day for me. =)</p></div>

              <p>Hmm i wouldnt pay for something I havent gotten. Always need to check that the product I am buying is in good condition before handing over my moolah.</p>
              <p>I thought standard procedure would be reservation with another outlet, then u go over and pay there.</p>
              <p>Anyway since its just 25+ its really no big deal and not much damage.</p>

              <p>Well, you can always ask for the availability of the stocks over there or ask them to transfer it over.</p>
              <p>Even if the shops were of the same boss, it is totally fine when the price is listed differently. For example, like SK and Soo Kee. They are of the same boss and sometimes, cross over products for sale and the price is listed differently.</p>
              <p>You can not say that you are cheated as the concept is different. I would had requested for the transfer or go over to the other outlet to purchase the item.</p>
              <p>Like the other time, I am not satisfy with the last piece in Polo located in Taka, I requested them to check and walked over to Shaws to purchase the new piece. They would reserve the item even if you do not make payment. But for your case in a small shop, they might not do the same...</p>
              <p>A lot of shops helped me to transfer the stock without prior payment too...</p>
