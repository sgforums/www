            <div class='col-md body'>Just a little bored, not willing to log off yet and has been thinking abt this for past few days...<br><br>At one time or another in life, I've seen pple go all out to nail someone down becos of one reason or another. Sometimes, it's simply just none of their business, but they kaypoh, hit back at the person, drag the person thru a lot of mud, and well, embarass the person badly.<br><br>But that makes me think. I'm just 20+++, and I've seen pple who are my age or even younger, doing these things. Have they ever had the experience of being embarrased by anyone b4?<br><br>In my short past, I was the person doing the embarassing act, not giving face to anyone and didn't give the person a chance to "get off the stage gracefully". I had my retribution, and now, whenever I can, I won't go all out and nail the person down. Whenever I do something bad, I will think "Better dun go too far... scarely the person get back to me".<br><br>Sadly, I still see my frens doing this, not giving face to the person, embarassing pple without thinking. It pains my heart to see someone trying to destroy someone out of impulse...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>200 years? No lah. At least the Ang Moh when they set their minds to do something, they can totally set aside their differences and unite to accomplish one common goal. Chinese? Wah lao, each and every one of them has their own private agenda, and then must appease their face somemore, even if they have accomplished nothing!

            <div class='col-md body'>I dunno... somehow, giving face is like showing mercy... give u a chance to get away... not crawl away...<br><br>Somehow face is important to Chinese &amp; Jap... how come Jap can accomplish so much more than Chinese?<br><br>Another thing is "show face"... it's something like "give face". For example, this person is quite important and this person gives a party... therefore, I have to attend the party, else the person will think I dun give the person 'face'.<br><br>Recently, I 'show face' until sian liao... events which I dun feel like attending, but in the end I attend becos I have to go there and 'show face' (out of responsibility too).
