            <div class='col-md body'>Hi yall. You know this past week after Tuesday has been very very different and good! Very rewarding. Because now, I encounter things and situations that would have made me really mad and frustrated, or even suicidal sometimes had it not been for Tuesday. Its amazing. I began the week as usual being depressed and all that stuff, the usual, isolation and stuff. But I admitted that my problem was this:<br><br>My suffering or percieved suffering of "isolation" was what I made it out to be. I allowed the fact that people here did not talk to me much, to cripple me and turn me into a indignant ass. But until Tuesday, this problem had always been with me. I could not change my expectations of people, I had always struggled with that even though I knew I had to modify my mindset, to not care about other people, more specifically: Not to base my happiness on others, but myself. Not many people do talk/communicate with me or even accept me, and I had always been depressed because of that.<br><br>On Tuesday, my gp teacher recognised my "evil-depressed" appearance and asked what was wrong. I explained to him and all. He and I identified my problem (being above), and he said to me, I lacked the strength to solve this problem myself. He used this analogy, "if the watch is broken, you have to go to the watchmaker". He asked me to open my heart to God. Although I was very reluctant (given the history of the Church and all), I simply did speak to God. And I believed he could hear me, well being an omnipotent being everywhere such as he is. I explained my problems and asked for the strength to not get all worked up over people.<br><br>Eversince then, I have encountered situations that would have made me all frustrated and all, but strangely I have remained calm and at peace with these situations. I can only ask myself "what the heck happened, why aren't I angry?" I cannot explain it.<br><br>But other than me not getting mad over other people. Everything else with me is normal. Example, I still quarrel with my mum sometimes, and I find it confused and perplexing why I have this block with people, and I sometimes do wonder why I have no clique like other people, but I only think about these things without any anger or frustration haha! The most important change is: I AM NOT MAD anymore! I am not frustrated. In fact I feel happier now.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
