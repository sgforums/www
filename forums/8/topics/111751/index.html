Problem is many of our talents are pre-emptively retrenched by fellow Singapore companies so that they can upkeep the salaries of the FT that they hire. Many of the retrenched local talents have ended up as taxi drivers or door to door salesmen.<br><br>I feel sad for our fellow taxi drivers and d-d salesmen as they (or their husbands) have served National Service which deprived them of 2.5 years of getting even better experience or talent. 2.5 years can also mean 1 promotion or 1 pay rise or time to study the part-time diploma/degree. That excludes the work-disrupting reservist duties they have to go through even after NS. Do the FTs do national service for Singapore? Do they need to waste 2.5 years of their time? Do they need to forgo 2.5 years of proper salary?<br><br>Dear simpleton Shelly, if you do not agree with caramon's thread, just reply why you disagree. No need to use vulgar language.</div>

And like so many other locals, I've always welcomed foreign-talent, provided they are real talents (I've met a few of these and fully respect them) and are here in the spirit of friendship and mutual benefits.  I'm also tolerant in the sense that I don't even mind foreigners who have no real talent, but are here just to live the life here, mix around and have some cultural exchange, all in the spirit of friendship.  Obviously, you don't belong to any of these descriptions.<br><br>Are you a local who blindly idolises foreigners and imported goods, in order to elevate your own status?  (just like those dogs who carried foreigners during colonial times).<br><br>Or do you belong to the great numbers of so-called foreign-talent whose only strength is your charisma, shooting off your mouth at the comparitively non-confrontational locals, trying to elevate yourself to colonial master status?<br><br></div>

Mind you, employers are not opening charity organisations. Yes, some employers are biased, then it's their loss and bad insights if employing  PRC or is far more better than getting you, which in actual fact you are far more worth every dollar employer spent on. On the another hand, those good employers who do that certainly indicate you need to do something..<br><br>I don't want to sound cruel, but if a problem happens, don't dwell on it as there's no much time in pointing fingers. Better off finding another employer. I don't know what have happened to you, but from my experience, so far the indians that I have met are no doubt good but no far better than some of my fellow singaporeans who are so far better and employers can't find better reasons to replace them with PRC or indians.</div>
