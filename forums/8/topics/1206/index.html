            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br>I must admit I have thought of this question before : Who much does a wedding cost? Being interested in wedding gowns and having cousins getting married, I tired doing a tabulation and I must admit it's quite a lot.<br><br>Basically, the wedding dinner does cost a lot, and now, you probably can't get a table for less than $500 (respectable food only) on weekends. But like what most of you said, unless you have stingy friends or relatives, the Hong Baos usually cover the cost of the banquet. And if you have generous parents who are willing to food the bill, then you get to pocket the hong baos. Do try to pay using credit cards... you might win a condo during lucky draws  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>As for rings, just get a decent one can already... I think I'm going to get a platinum band... maybe with a small diamond. No point getting a big diamond ring...the diamond will get scratch and lose its shine. Like that $1500 should be able to get a pair of wedding bands.<br><br>As for the wedding gowns, bridegroom's suit, flowers for bride and the car, etc... they usually come in a package, sometimes with photo shots included... may come to over $5000 ++ It will definitely cost more if you go for Wera Wong's gown or David Gan's hairstyling...<br><br>If it's just a simple wedding with the above specification and taking into consideration things like Ang Bao on the wedding day, 2 weeks honeymoon to Australia (just an example), costs should be around 25k.<br><br>But for fanciful couples who want the best on their wedding day, some might choose to go for body-slimming programs, nail treatments, facial, live band during banquet, exotic honeymoons, 5-stars hotel banquet, etc... the cost will be a few times more then...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well.. Rinoa, you are right, it's never easy to maintain a Jaguar. Sigh, but Jaguar more challenging mah.<br><br>One more thing, is the guy supposed to get both the rings or just one for the gal? Isn't it supposed to be a gift for each other, then the gal should get the one for the guy right? By the way, beside the diamond ring, is there also a pair of wedding rings?<br><br>Lex.. me marrying panties?? Hahaha.. no lah, at least not in the near future, I still dun have the capability to sustain a Jaguar, wait till I can manage.
