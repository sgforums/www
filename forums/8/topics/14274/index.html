            <div class='col-md body'>Today's papers... Government decides to lower Income Tax so as to ENCOURAGE more foreign talents to work here (foreign talents again..?).... They mentioned that because of the high income tax, it won't be attractive enough for the foreign talents to work here.... Ok... I GOT your POINT...? BUT THEN....<br><br>GST's going up..??! &lt;- To benefit and attract the FOREIGN TALENTS on the PEELING of our SKINS..???<br><br>Business Rule No.1 <strong>DO NOT</strong> incur LOSS or HEIGHTEN prices at the COST of your CONSUMERS but instead INCREASE the STANDARD and QUALITY....<br><br>Now my QUESTION is, after putting in SO MUCH EFFORT and PRODUCTIVITY thing into the industrial and ISO SHIT have we INCREASED our standard...?<br><br>Points to note...<br><br>1. People's living condition is GOING DOWNHILL (despite the CONTRIBUTIONS we've MADE to our country)... Pay is NOT on the raise and people are RETRENCHED... YET, Singapore's living standard CONTINUES to go UP... eg. GST... (Increase in GST??)<br><br>2. Government is ENCOURAGING people to do business and saying that they would give 'benefits' to them... YET, increasing GST is as good as putting things BACK to SQUARE 1...? What WERE they TALKING ABOUT? Such an act would DEFINITELY not ENCOURAGE business in these FRESH BLOODs....<br><br>3. The EXISTING businesses and industries that's only beginning to see that slight glimmer of LIGHT and hope...? To boost up SALES and TRADES...? BUSINESS...? I only see INCREASE in GST as a SUICIDAL move...<br><br>4. Government also mention to look into how the LOW PAY classes of Singapore can handle the new increase in GST...? I would like to see HOW are they gonna do that...? IN ACTIONS please...?<br><br>5. Besides... MOST of the LOW INCOME families are already income tax EXEMPTED... It won't make much of a DIFFERENCE to have FURTHER EXEMPTION....?<br><br>------------------<br>In LIGHT I shall FEAR NOT. FOR what I AM is CUT so DEEP inside of ME.<br>I LIVE my FLESH and SOUL ONLY to BLEED for the OTHERS.<br>FEAR ME NOT. FOR I AM YOUR 'MASTER'. GIVE YOU STRENGTH. FOR YOU ARE MY 'ENEMY'.<br>DEVIL PHRASE I<br><br>I have no 'friends' nor 'family'.<br>I hold no past and see not future...<br>These are just samples of illusions....<br>I don't exist, but I shall live ETERNITY.....  DEVIL PHRASE II<br><br>Though NOT the RIGHT thing to do,<br>This might be the ONLY NATURAL thing to be...<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Just like heat</span> is produced when work done...<br><span style="font-style: italic;">EVIL</span> is the GENERATION of SYSTEM FLAWS... <strong>DEVIL PHRASE III</strong><br><br>In DREAMS you CAN NEVER DIE.....<br>For YOUR LIFE is about the EXISTENCE of....<br>Your Happiness.... Your Sadness... Your Pain.... Your Pleasure....<br>Like a painted sky, when it rains... All CEASE to BE...    DEVIL PHRASE IV<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Through Chaos the Devil gain strength,<br>to face the lord, his Creator.<br>Through his questionings, he recovered his true existence...<br>Good &amp; Evil, Can they co-exists in harmony?</span>  DEVIL PHRASE V<br><br>When Law &amp; Rules are there,<br>they are NOT about JUSTICE.<br>While reality &amp; dreams are there,<br>they are NOT about SURVIVAL..<br><br>And Life &amp; Death NOT about LIVING...<br>Good &amp; Evil NOT about definitions....<br><br>IF truly there is EVIL, it is NOT just one of its kind......<br><br>DEVIL'S SEVENTH PHRASE<br><br>ÃŸe COOL, NOT sÂ¢rrÂ¥....<br><br>[This message has been edited by Devil1976 (edited 05 April 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I hafen read today's papers yet, but I think this helps those who spend less on luxuries. GST is hell a lot on luxuries, but basic necessicities dun haf a lot -- At least NTUC absorb the GST.<br><br>Retrenched pple can't afford much luxury anyway, so no need to pay much GST. Reduced income tax is ok if they get a job la, but the govt muz try to increase employment first. But this cannot be done in a short time.<br><br>One thing... Encouraging more enterprises means more employment a not? Increase quality of gds, wil this really increase sales? Increase in quality can bring abt increase in price, so will pple stil buy?<br><br>Y pple stil buy gds made in China? Cuz it is cheap and usable. Though quality may be slightly lower, at least it can tide over for the time being.<br><br>Foreign talent, useful? We got a large pool of undergraduates stil unemployed, y muz we stil look for foreign talent? Do we haf the monetary means to get them when a lot of pple are in need of help?<br><br>I rather the Govt try to attract more MNCs and provides a hell lot of incentives to start-ups which looks promising.<br><br>------------------<br>Thomas Edison definition of genius :<br>"1% inspiration, 99% perspiration"<br><br>************************************<br>The Eagle<br><br>He clasps the crag with hooked hands:<br>Close to the sun in lonely lands,<br>Ringed with the azure world, he stands.<br><br>The wrinkled sea beneath him crawls;<br>He watches from his mountain walls,<br>And like a thunderbolt he falls.<br>************************************</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another point to add...? I remember some time ago when the government was encouraging business and enterprise to round off the GST 3% thing as it tends to make alot of 'cents'...<br><br>Hmm... I guess this can also be PART of the government's plan to overcome this problem...? So you should expect the next GST to be 5% or 10%...? Not to mention the nowadays VERY COMMON SERVICE CHARGE which could make the price INCREASE to about 15-20% of the NORMAL cost...? Hmm... 1/5 MORE...? Go think about it....?<br><br>And Eagle's point of LUXURY and NECCESSITIES...? Few points to add....<br><br>1. Though the daily neccessities don't cost much by themselves but when you're doing your monthly grocery, try adding the sum up and do a GST % calculation on that...?<br><br>2. Neccessities don't imply to only daily little stuffs... How about getting a NEW TV? Fridge..? Flat...? &lt;- Are these LUXURY..? Ok, now talk about MORE 'luxury' stuffs... PCs, furnitures...? Hmm... DEVELOPING COUNTRY people having the PHOBIA of buying things...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Now that would be INTERESTING...?<br><br>3. The FOOD industries and RELATED separate RETAIL lines... As you people probably know the last time GST was INTRODUCED there wasn't a DIRECT increase in the price of food mainly because it's quite impossible...? How about the smaller things down the chain...? Are you SURE they're all gonna be just the 'GST %' increment in price..? Every retail point INCREASE a bit MORE than GST % ENOUGH to KILL you liao... And when companies start to make UNREASONABLE INCREASE in PRICES, I'll be WAITING for the SAME PATTERN... 1. People COMPLAIN 2. CASE study. 3. CASE issue WARNINGs. 4. FULL STOP.<br><br>GOOD LUCK....?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am not saying necessities has negligible GST, but rather in the case of NTUC, it has absorbed the GST.<br><br>As for luxuries, it depends on the household income. For someone who earns for e.g. 6000 a mth, a TV may be a necessity, for another person who brings home 2000 a mth, a TV is a luxury. Get it?<br><br>Anyway, so far S'pore's GST not tt high compared to some countries as advanced as us. Taiwan's one I forgot, but I noe it is very very high. Malaysia is at 5%.<br><br>High income tax makes us wonder if it is really worth it if we spend so little on gds, yet need to pay so much in taxes. We can see this and feel the impact directly. GST on the other hand is almost invisible. It is present within the goods, and though it adds up to a lot when u calculate it out, at the moment u pay for the gds, u dun feel as much pinch as that of income tax.<br><br>------------------<br>Thomas Edison definition of genius :<br>"1% inspiration, 99% perspiration"<br><br>************************************<br>The Eagle<br><br>He clasps the crag with hooked hands:<br>Close to the sun in lonely lands,<br>Ringed with the azure world, he stands.<br><br>The wrinkled sea beneath him crawls;<br>He watches from his mountain walls,<br>And like a thunderbolt he falls.<br>************************************</div>

Like I've mentioned as above, decrease in income tax would have LITTLE or NO implications for the lower income families and hence a relative increase for GST would act as a BURDEN.<br><br>The AMENDMENT as mentioned, is MAINLY to decrease the income tax for the foreigners as to attract MORE foreign talents. For your information, income tax for foreigners are usually much higher as they don't have much exemptions like Singaporean do... And do you really think the money would go so much into spending in Singapore than to spending in their own country? Travel? Or even for their own family? For your information, Singapore is WELL-KNOWN as a country without much entertainment...<br><br>ORIGINAL SYSTEM:<br><br>Company earn $. People with high income TAXED. People with spending ability continue to spend. Push ECONOMY. ie. Company earn $?<br><br>NEW SYSTEM:<br><br>TAX on GST seals or lower spending. Poor people no spending power, people with high income exercise spending power. Economy either topple over or subject to a rich gets richer, poor gets poorer situation.<br><br>Additional notes:<br><br>1. The switch of balance between Income Tax and GST might have stem from the fact of the ECONOMIC CRISIS. Retrenchments have resulted in many without income or a pay-cut hence indirectly LOWERING the taxing-power exercised by the government. Government may have thought of exercising its TAXING POWER focus from INCOME to DIRECT SALES. Hence, getting a BETTER TAXING ABILITY but at the venture of enterprises and companies sharing their cake with a larger sliced out.<br><br>2. The RICH gets RICHER and POOR gets POORER. The situation of 'TOLERANCE' between different STATUS and WEALTH is gonna occur. The RESULT? See INDONESIA and the like countries. The SOLUTION? A PURGE of the people with the RICH and TALENTED (Foreigners?)...? This picture would COLLAPSED when foreigners can no longer be PURGED and not so 'well-tamed' like 'topical Singaporeans'. Solution? Even more IRON-FISTED controlled country. And of course, there is another equally probable proposal. But due to its NATURE shall not be discussed here...</div>
