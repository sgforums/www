To investigate on his murder. Time is running out as new revelation were revealed day by day. Can you solve the murder before the murderer kills more people? Can you stop the rampaging before the Murderer puts you on the next list?<br><br>As the elite detective of the world. You'll need to determine 3 things.<br>1) Who is the murderer(s)?<br>2) What is his/her motive?<br>3) How did he execute his/her murder?<br><br>It could be a coordinated job or a one man show.<br><br>The mystery will be reveal when the murder is solved or you turn out to be the victim of the next homicide.<br><br>You're  in John Ho's mansion.... He was murdered less than 24 hours ago in his study room. Apparantly he was poisoned and the dead within 3 hours. There lies a bowl of bird nest soup on the table where he got murdered. Apparantly the poison is in the bird nest which is now empty.<br><br>The bird nest was first brew by the Cook at about 6pm placed in the fridge and carried to John Ho's consumption by his wife Linda at about 8pm after dinner. John Ho died at 10pm when his wife came back to check on him.<br><br>The following people are now inside the mansion.<br><br>John Ho - an inherited billionaire owns a technological company "Synergy". He was enterprising and innovative. He has a very strong educational background and live a orderly and discipline life. Morning jog, short afternoon nap and a little desert of soups in the night is a must. He had only a wife and no known Children. Did had a relationship before with a bavarian woman some says that He had a child with that woman... but little is known for now and couldn't be confirmed at present.<br>- That day he had his dinner went to the study room before his wife brings him the bird nest... drunk and died later after his wife leaves. He was discovered only when his wife came back to retrieve the bowl at 10pm. Screamed before everyone rushes to the study room.<br><br>Linda - John's wife. They met last year on a company party. And got married 3 months after. Although Linda's father who is an active service man who serve in the army as a Sargent Major strongly disapprove the marriage.  Stayed married till now. His father died last year in an army accident. John and Linda did when to the funneral. But wasn't seems to be quite welcomed.<br>- "Had dinner and went to collect the birdnest from the cook and bought to John at the time of the murder."<br><br>Alex Ho - The only 2nd Heir to Synergy. He is the nephew of John Ho. Since both John and Alex are known to be childless and there are no other descendant to the Ho family. John and Alex is the only Heir to the Synergy Empire. Alex was said to had an affair with Linda by the Talpoid news..<br>- "Watching TV after dinner alone, You wanna join me?"<br><br>Philips - Had always been a strong competitor of Synergy. He runs Offshore corporation that for years were the nail of the eye of Synergy. Eventually offshore failed the competition and was absorbed by Synergy for the past 1 year. Alex pulled him over to work for Synergy despite the past difference as He see an edge in Philips. Alex and Philips became good friends He was invited to John's mansion over the weekend for company year end party and stayed for another week before returning to New york.<br>- "taking a bathe after dinner alone, Don't you trust me?"<br><br>Cook - The cook that had been working with the Ho's for 3 months and introduced by the Butler who was from malaysia too. Little else is known.<br>- "What else? Cooking during the time of murder..."<br><br>Butler - He was serving John for at least 2 decades. Enduring his temper and whims. John Ho wasn't a very mild mannered man though. He was fired on notice 5 days ago. He had a family in Malaysia and a senile mother. The sole bread winner of the family is also a good friend of the Cook. Often people could see them chatting in the kitchen.<br>- "Taking dinner after the family had theirs. And yes I was chatting with the Cook at about 6." He said<br><br>Gardener - A young man with strong german accent. Background unclear.<br>- Gardening and had dinner with the butler and the rest of the staff.<br><br>Driver - A young man... nothing much is know else.<br>- Was car and had dinner with the butler and the rest of the staff after the family had theirs.<br><br>Finally a note: None of these shall be revealed to the police first... or you'll crush the stock market. Now we need the murderer arrested soon.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Something is not quite right though.. Since the poison killed him 3 hrs after consumption, he could have died somewhere between 8pm to 10pm. This means possibility is that the poison was consumed from 5pm to 7pm. This means, although the poison was found in the soup which was consumed at 8pm, from the facts, it is impossible that he was killed by the poison in the soup.<br>It seems that someone puts the poison in the soup to mislead and trying to put the blame on the cook unless the murderer know that it is a routine that the wife always bring the soup to him after dinner hence, trying to put the blame on the wife or the cook.<br>However, this are all assumptions but what is certain, from the facts, is that he is definitely not killed by the poison in the soup. For all we know, he might not be even killed by the poison. It's possible that he was murdered and thought to be poisoned because of the poison in the soup that he drank.<br><br>Current Highly possible suspects:<br>Wife, motive: Taking revenge on husband for cheating on her and also helping her scandal get the inheritance.<br>Nephew, motive: Inheritance<br><br>Need more clues banzie..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm.... Ok poison within 3 hours means the wife could probably be inside the second time around maybe let say... 10+ ... She could have brought the soup in by 8 its about 2 hours and 45 mins... Sorry for the misunderstanding... but that was very very observant by the detective... very promising... haha... Points out a little confusing mistake too haha. Yea he was poisoned by the bird nest No doubt.<br><br>There could be more than one murderer. Join forces.<br><br>Hmmm... Linda could also be the murderer... and murder John so that they could elope with Alex... He is the next to the inheritant list isn't it?<br><br>Alex could also be...  the murderer... Since he could control the entire Synergy Empire...<br><br>Philips is another possibility... After all he hated John.... he could have joined forces with Alex too to kill John...<br><br>What about the cook... he is The butler good friend isn't it? He could have easily put the poison helping his good old friend.<br><br>And The butler... is it him?<br><br>Or the gardener the mystery guy?<br><br>How about the driver is he really washing car?<br><br>Stay tune Tomorrow a new turn of the story.<br><br></div>
