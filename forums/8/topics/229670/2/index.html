            <div class='col-md body'>First up,<br><br>The key component in this murder is the bird's nest soup.<br>It is prepared and placed in the fridge at 6pm, taken to John at 8pm.<br>meaning someone could have doped the soup in the fridge between 6pm to 8pm.<br><br>Since the wife and cook would be highly suspected of the murder,<br>they will find ways to escape the suspicions.<br><br>Since John Ho is a high profile character, the death of him will certainly place limelight on those around him, meaning Alex (inheritance), Linda (just got married) and Butler (just got fired).<br><br>Linda: method of murder too direct, wouldn't be her. just gotten married and opposed strongly by father means she knows what she wants, killing John has no real advantage coz John MARRIED her and Alex not guaranteed. not her.<br><br>Alex Ho: even if he is the 2nd in heir, looking at him being the nephew, he most likely is younger than John. he would be enjoying his time and in no rush to succeed Synergy. and since John is enterprising and innovative, again, there is no real advantage of killing John since John could be the reason why Synergy is successful. not him.<br><br>Philips: Appears to joined the party and stayed over the week. Wouldn't have planned this out without knowing the details of John's birdnest soup consumption. not him.<br><br>Cook: helping Butler by killing John? not him.<br><br>Butler: killing John to secure his job? not him.<br><br>Gardener: Suggestive. Bavarian speak in German, he has a German accent and is young. he could be John Ho's child with the Bavarian woman.. but does it matter? would you kill your father who left you and your mother? maybe John hired him knowing he was his son? personal revenge? Since the story surrounds the heir issue and keeps suggesting Alex and John has no child and they're the only heirs. I would say the killer is the Gardener who poison the soup when it's in the fridge (he knows the soup is for John). He will come out to claim some (or all?) fortune after John's death. (blood tests and such)<br><br>Driver: so little information. nothing points to him. not him.<br><br>TIE UP THE GARDENER!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i agree wif wavesofthoughts. the gardener is suspicious..<br><br>shuld be the child john had wif the bavarian women.<br><br>but could it be john already acknowledge the child liao.. but he dun wan the alex and his wife found out the family actually has a heir so he juz employ him as a gardener.. at the same time can take care of him while wun reveal his identity?<br><br>But alex eventually found out.. so before john reveal his son's identity.. he juz killed him so as to sha ren mie kou. he collaborate wif his wife because his wife oso damn furious bout her husband having an affair.<br><br>in tis way.. even when john's son came out and claim he is john's son.. he inevitably oso become the biggest suspect.. since his motive is the most loud among the rest.<br><br>and i suspect the nex one to be killed will b the gardener.<br><br>first guess 1. the poison is nvr put during 6-8pm.. the wife wan to make sure john is the one whu eat the poison. how she allow to put the poison at 6-8pm and someone actualli drank it and died and alert everyone?<br><br>when she bring the bird nest to john.. she then put poison.. and she can control the timing to go back to the room and found his body and alert everyone. banzie sae she could go back around 10+ oso.<br><br>2nd guess. but the prob is... alex could have collaborate wif butler and cook too.. rem butler hates john and he is jobless and have a senile mother.. sole breadwinner. mayb he use $ to bribe the butler to kill john. which in turn the butler ask cook to poison john wif the bird nest. but it is highly impossible tis way.. butler will use tis to threaten alex and ask him for $ every other time.. alex rather collaborate wif someone close to him. someone who love him.. his scandal.. linda.<br><br>phillips is another suspicious character. he is invited to join over the coy by alex.. not john.. he owe it to alex. he may help alex out. he may get to a high position in the coy as a result of alex taking the reins of the coy.<br><br>the statements of the suspects is redundant. they oni sae wad are they doin when john is killed tt is 8-10pm .. but so wad.. the poison could have been put durin 6-8pm.. they shuld have give their statements as in what are they doing during 6-8pm. oni we noe butler and cook is toking.. gardener is gardening.. driver washing car. but wad is alex .. wife .. phillips doing at tt time?<br><br>eh banzie more clues la.. ur clues realli you3 de4 mei3 de4. like nv give at all one.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>heh, i agree with emre.<br><br>as on a case, we should at least know the age/gender of the suspects in the house.<br>(things that we can see and tell - clear facts) and as in all murder case quizzes, the information provided should be TOTALLY accurate. else how to guess ar.. lol<br><br>i luv your cases banzie! but it appears to have typos and loopholes in the information. i do not want to be complacent and so i based my detections on the informations (1st post) provided. otherwise please state what can be asked and what not?<br><br>however, emre.. you should really choose 1 scenario as your answer mah.. haha else unfair leh! i also know there's alot of possibilities!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wah... was really having cold sweat when reading all your deduction...Tot the mystery already solved on the first part.... some of you are close but.. must give a confirm answer lah... cannot give 5-6 answer then expect me to choose mah... But that was really good try...<br><br>And so you as the elite detective is in the mansion you sleep overnight thinking about the case. You had slept little for the night. The next morning you woke up, locked your door and ready to go do for your breakfast when you saw the gardener walk out of Linda's room. When the gardener saw you, both your eyes met for a while before he rushes down. Your detective instinct smelled a mystery. You went to Linda's room and interregate her of the incident. After years of interregations you have no problem getting her to leak the cat. She handed you a paper envelope. Inside is the photos of the Gardener and his mother. Linda had all along been hiring a private investigator to investigate on the son of John. And the gardener is the son of John with the bavarian woman. But what shocked her is that his son suddenly appeared before them applying for the job in the mansion. Although John had not be aware of his own son working under him. Linda had been devestated not knowing what the gardener is eactly up to.  After much discussion, you agree that you shall not reveal the secrets to anyone else before you left for your breakfast.<br><br>After breakfast Alex insist on volunteering to drive you around Synergy to have a look. Philips seems to have his own work to do therefore unable to join you. So Alex, the driver and you left the mansion to play alittle golf before heading to Synergy Corporation. You got to know that Synergy was created by His grandfather or John's Father. The strength of Synergy had always been their world class industrial chemical production. In fact they are the leader in the industry. Alex had join the company about 8 years ago after university. And Linda was once the employees of Synergy too before she met John in the company function. Philips was a self made billionaire and competitor of Synergy but failed in the competition. If not for Alex's ideal of slavaging philip's offshore corporation, Philips would had lost his job and his 20 years of hardwork. That's how they becomes good friends.<br><br>At the end of the day. You came back to the mansion it was pretty late now about 10pm. You reach to your room open up the door and surprised that the door is unlocked. You tried to switch on the lights but to no avail. Out of a sudden you realised a dark figurine appeared at a distance outside the window looking at you. And left immediately after been spotted. The momment of the person seems to tells you that the person is quite young. You rush to your window to had a clearer look at the figurine but he was gone. The next day, you tell the butler to change the light bulb as it seems faulty. Both of you are in shocked that the light bulb seems to contain an amount of ammonium nitrate. If only last night you had switch the light bulb alittle longer... You'll  now be dead.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Alex, Linda and the driver.<br><br>Both the gardener and driver are young.. so it would either be the driver or gardener. Since the driver had no motive, he must be instructed by Alex or Linda to kill John.. and also the detective.<br><br>Linda and Alex may have affair because Talpoid news said so.. and Alex was watching tv.. maybe to see what the news will say again.<br><br>Linda and John's marriage wasnt long. Besides, Linda's father disapprove of the marriage.. so Linda must be quite young compared to John. About 40?<br><br>It's probably Alex and Linda who wanted him dead, as Alex can inherit the company and marry Linda. So they got the driver to do it.<br><br>The gardener may be the next to die.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by banzie:</div><div class="quote_body">You're one of the most elite detective in the world and was invited to a 68 year old Billionaire John Ho's mansion in Singapore secretly. To investigate on his murder. Time is running out as new revelation were revealed day by day. Can you solve the murder before the murderer kills more people? Can you stop the rampaging before the Murderer puts you on the next list?<br><br>As the elite detective of the world. You'll need to determine 3 things.<br>1) Who is the murderer(s)?<br>2) What is his/her motive?<br>3) How did he execute his/her murder?<br><br>It could be a coordinated job or a one man show.<br><br>The mystery will be reveal when the murder is solved or you turn out to be the victim of the next homicide.<br><br>You're  in John Ho's mansion.... He was murdered less than 24 hours ago in his study room. Apparantly he was poisoned and the dead within 3 hours. There lies a bowl of bird nest soup on the table where he got murdered. Apparantly the poison is in the bird nest which is now empty.<br><br>The bird nest was first brew by the Cook at about 6pm placed in the fridge and carried to John Ho's consumption by his wife Linda at about 8pm after dinner. John Ho died at 10pm when his wife came back to check on him.<br><br>The following people are now inside the mansion.<br><br>John Ho - an inherited billionaire owns a technological company "Synergy". He was enterprising and innovative. He has a very strong educational background and live a orderly and discipline life. Morning jog, short afternoon nap and a little desert of soups in the night is a must. He had only a wife and no known Children. Did had a relationship before with a bavarian woman some says that He had a child with that woman... but little is known for now and couldn't be confirmed at present.<br>- That day he had his dinner went to the study room before his wife brings him the bird nest... drunk and died later after his wife leaves. He was discovered only when his wife came back to retrieve the bowl at 10pm. Screamed before everyone rushes to the study room.<br><br>Linda - John's wife. They met last year on a company party. And got married 3 months after. Although Linda's father who is an active service man who serve in the army as a Sargent Major strongly disapprove the marriage.  Stayed married till now. His father died last year in an army accident. John and Linda did when to the funneral. But wasn't seems to be quite welcomed.<br>- "Had dinner and went to collect the birdnest from the cook and bought to John at the time of the murder."<br><br>Alex Ho - The only 2nd Heir to Synergy. He is the nephew of John Ho. Since both John and Alex are known to be childless and there are no other descendant to the Ho family. John and Alex is the only Heir to the Synergy Empire. Alex was said to had an affair with Linda by the Talpoid news..<br>- "Watching TV after dinner alone, You wanna join me?"<br><br>Philips - Had always been a strong competitor of Synergy. He runs Offshore corporation that for years were the nail of the eye of Synergy. Eventually offshore failed the competition and was absorbed by Synergy for the past 1 year. Alex pulled him over to work for Synergy despite the past difference as He see an edge in Philips. Alex and Philips became good friends He was invited to John's mansion over the weekend for company year end party and stayed for another week before returning to New york.<br>- "taking a bathe after dinner alone, Don't you trust me?"<br><br>Cook - The cook that had been working with the Ho's for 3 months and introduced by the Butler who was from malaysia too. Little else is known.<br>- "What else? Cooking during the time of murder..."<br><br>Butler - He was serving John for at least 2 decades. Enduring his temper and whims. John Ho wasn't a very mild mannered man though. He was fired on notice 5 days ago. He had a family in Malaysia and a senile mother. The sole bread winner of the family is also a good friend of the Cook. Often people could see them chatting in the kitchen.<br>- "Taking dinner after the family had theirs. And yes I was chatting with the Cook at about 6." He said<br><br>Gardener - A young man with strong german accent. Background unclear.<br>- Gardening and had dinner with the butler and the rest of the staff.<br><br>Driver - A young man... nothing much is know else.<br>- Was car and had dinner with the butler and the rest of the staff after the family had theirs.<br><br>Finally a note: None of these shall be revealed to the police first... or you'll crush the stock market. Now we need the murderer arrested soon.</div></blockquote>linda and alex and butler<br><br>Gardener is john son so is impossible a son will kill his father and tat's no motive.<br>Driver not much information given<br>cook. the butler use him to cover out his motive so ppl wun suspent him becoz he cook the bird nest for john<br>philips is oso impossible he doesn't know john well even he wan to kill john n tat's impossible not to alert ppl.<br>left linda and alex liao alex is the only inherit when john die n they r oso on affair tat's the biggest motive to kill john and linda he only know john for 3month and already married so isn't it obvious she was eyeing on john asset.<br><br>linda put the psn inside the birdnest when she is on the way to john's room<br><br>case solved<br><br></div>

Sorry for some of the loop holes and such... but if I do write a very detailed story that will be much much longer than this... I can see some people complaining. Then again... some are redundant. Some I purposely don't tell you so that you'll have to deduce.<br><br>Firstly there could only be two suspect in part 1. Cook and Wife. Simply Cook between 6-8 is preparing food and dinner for the rest of the people. No one can really got to put the poison without his knowing...In any case he will never be innocent who ever put poison before him. Its also unlikely that someone could have went into the room and poison John.. also remember he died also the timing is not right remmeber the 3 hour thing? So it could only be the wife and the Cook. Then again if the cook wanted to kill John he will never put poison on the food he made... Isn't it quite dumb to let everyone suspect him?<br><br>Round two.... The ammonium nitrate in the light bulb... hmmm it is illegal to possess them... who have ability to get these stuff? John, Linda, Alex and Philips. They own a Chemical company isn't it? The door is locked and how could it be opened? Only the mistress or the butler has the key. The young person outside the window? Judging from Linda's father's age, we can see she is in much younger. She is the black figurine outside. Finally what is she and the gardener talking about? She actually wants him to get out of the house. You wouldn't know this until you read part 3 or 4.<br><br>Finally He will try to kill the gardener which the gardener will escape (it will be a mystery too) And eventually Alex... as Alex wasn't Linda accomplice... then again that will be in part 4.<br><br>Wah you guys very smart leh... very tired to think of very very hard quiz so fast solve liao. Think if all can write story for TCS... TCS series sux... I guess this will be the last I wrote... Fireice isn't happy about it.</div>
