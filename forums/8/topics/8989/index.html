            <div class='col-md body'>After a brief encounter wif a fiesty short grrl on Friday . I have begun to appreciate them . They are the one who put a smile on your face as they waddle past you after a tired day's worth of work . They make excellent beer can holders.. all they need is a special cup holder that fits on their head and then they become useful .<br><br>They are also an excellent source for a free treat . Since no one can be bothered wif them.. they value any form of company and would pay to keep it . By spending a little time wif them.. they'll think you're their best friend since they have no other friends to begin wif .<br><br>Short grrls are the most amusing from their pathetic attempts to become taller by wearing those high shoes... hahaha<br><br>Don't you think so Sparkle?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well qwerty, like i said, i'm not the best person to comment on this topic.<br><br>there are short people, and there are tall people.from my observations, short people are indeed nicer. they don't go around saying silly things like...<br><br>can you see the signpost? oh! i forgot, you're too short!<br><br>or<br><br>if i were so short, my view of the world would definitely be so different<br><br>or<br><br>oh, i forgot, you're nearer to the ground, so you should feel hotter<br><br>blah blah blah....<br><br>whether or not these statements make any logical sense, they're all said by people who think that they are superior simply coz they're taller. my conclusion is that tall people, or rather, tall guys, are such a bunch of insensitive pigs.</div>
