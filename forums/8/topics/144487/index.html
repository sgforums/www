            <div class='col-md body'>found this on the web:<br><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>Singapore beat Pahang 4-0 in the Final on 17th Dec 94 at the Shah Alam<br>Stadium in front of a full house of 81000 fans. The score was 1-0 at half<br>time. Abbas Saad, Singapore's Australian import player, scored a hat<br>trick, while Singapore's own soccer legend Fandi Ahmad netted the fourth.<br><br>It was a rather one-sided match, the Pahang side was depleted with the<br>absence of sweeper Alan Davidson, midfielders Dollah Salleh and Zulhamizan<br>Zakaria were out due to injury and suspension respectively. Pahang's<br>young players were overawed by the occasion. So was their custodian, who<br>is Malaysia's 1st choice goalie. His performance was below par. I guess<br>it's because that night was the first time the team played in front of<br>such a huge crowd, more than two-thirds of whom were Singapore fans.<br><br>The fans themselves were sporting...most of the time. Except for the<br>times when the ref's decision was against Singapore, every such decision<br>would be greeted with a vulgar 5-letter Malay word. The air horn would<br>hoot 9 times and the fans would shout the word in a disgusting fashion.<br>They had no respect for the FAM President, the Sultan of Pahang and the<br>Crown Prince of Pahang. Also present were Malaysian ministers. I've been<br>to other matches involving other teams. I have to admit, that, while the<br>Singapore fans are the most disciplined in the region, they are also the<br>most vulgar.<br></span></div>

The score was 1-0 at half<br>time. Abbas Saad, Singapore's Australian import player, scored a hat<br>trick, while Singapore's own soccer legend Fandi Ahmad netted the fourth.<br><br>It was a rather one-sided match, the Pahang side was depleted with the<br>absence of sweeper Alan Davidson, midfielders Dollah Salleh and Zulhamizan<br>Zakaria were out due to injury and suspension respectively. Pahang's<br>young players were overawed by the occasion. So was their custodian, who<br>is Malaysia's 1st choice goalie. His performance was below par. I guess<br>it's because that night was the first time the team played in front of<br>such a huge crowd, more than two-thirds of whom were Singapore fans.<br><br>The fans themselves were sporting...most of the time. Except for the<br>times when the ref's decision was against Singapore, every such decision<br>would be greeted with a vulgar 5-letter Malay word. The air horn would<br>hoot 9 times and the fans would shout the word in a disgusting fashion.<br>They had no respect for the FAM President, the Sultan of Pahang and the<br>Crown Prince of Pahang. Also present were Malaysian ministers. I've been<br>to other matches involving other teams. I have to admit, that, while the<br>Singapore fans are the most disciplined in the region, they are also the<br>most vulgar.<br></span></div></blockquote>Was Pahang the opposition? I remembered pahang is one of the stronger teams at that time, alongside singapore and kedah.<br><br>Not sure whether its 93 or 94, during the quarterfinal grp stage match against pahang at national stadium. Fandi scored a dramatic late winner after a fantastic assist from Sundram, to help Sg win 3-2. During the goal celebration, he cried... one of the most memorable and emotional moment of the glory malaysian cup days.<br><br></div>
