              <p>Community:</p>
              <p>As much as how Aus claims that its is a discrimination free country, it still exists in all levels in the place. Migrants are still treated 2nd class even when they possess the better skills than the locals. Many international students who studied in Aus, find themselves jobless, or end up employed as taxi drivers, supermarket cashiers or casuals. though there are avenues and help available for the unemployed or discriminated, these aren't easily accessible.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Law and order:</p>
              <p>The police isnt as much proactive as in asian countries.Usually a police report to be made takes a lot of hassle and court proceedings take a long time .Legal services are run and owned by private individuals who are doing a business.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Medical:</p>
              <p>Public medical services and facililities are not to be counted on in terms of emergency. High Medical fees for doctors are paid for just for consultation and one has to buy their own medicines</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Transport:</p>
              <p>Not as efficient as one will think and fare costs are usually high for such subpar service.Trains bd buses usually arrive every 15 mins. Finding a bus service route is usually confusing  due to lack of clear and precise information.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Education:</p>
              <p>Atrociously high fees for degrees which usually require 2-3 days attendance. Furthermore amneities fees have to be paid yearly for usually subpar and inferior campus facilities.</p>

              <p>As much as how Aus claims that its is a discrimination free country, it still exists in all levels in the place. Migrants are still treated 2nd class even when they possess the better skills than the locals. Many international students who studied in Aus, find themselves jobless, or end up employed as taxi drivers, supermarket cashiers or casuals. though there are avenues and help available for the unemployed or discriminated, these aren't easily accessible.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #993366;">Like you said, these are students. They could only work 20 hours per week under work conditions granted with their student visas. That's why most of them could only do casual jobs, e.g. in Coles/Woolsworth supermarket, waiters, in retail. The reason many can't get a decent full-time job yet is because they have not graduated.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Law and order:</p>
              <p>The police isnt as much proactive as in asian countries.Usually a police report to be made takes a lot of hassle and court proceedings take a long time .Legal services are run and owned by private individuals who are doing a business.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #993366;">How do you measure 'proactiveness'? If you're only comparing to Singapore, remember Singapore is but a small island, where every corner could be reached within the hour by car. In contrast, Aus is such a vast place, esp in remote areas, it will take longer to respond just taking into account distance and travelling time.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993366;">Re your point abour legal services, are you saying that lawyers in Singapore and other countries are not also doing a business? If anything there is at least a decent legal aid service in Australia for low-income residents.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #993366;">What do you mean public medical services are not to be counted on? As long as it is an emergency, I have not heard of any patient not given treatment. As for high consultation fees, you do not have to pay a single cent upfront if you go to a clinic that bulk-bill. As for prescriptions, whats the difference between paying for it at the pharmacy versus paying for it at the clinic together with the consultation fee? At least you know the doctors do not have a vest interest in prescribing expensive or unnecessary medications.</span></p>

              <p>Transport:</p>
              <p>Not as efficient as one will think and fare costs are usually high for such subpar service.Trains bd buses usually arrive every 15 mins. Finding a bus service route is usually confusing  due to lack of clear and precise information.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #993366;">Fare cost is high, but there is always the option of driving because it is affordable to buy a car. Trains and buses can be less frequent, but at least they are punctual most of the time.</span></p>
              <p>Education:</p>
              <p>Atrociously high fees for degrees which usually require 2-3 days attendance. Furthermore amneities fees have to be paid yearly for usually subpar and inferior campus facilities.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #993366;"> High fees applies to international students or other full-fee paying local students, i.e. they could not get a subsidized place.  I find fees are mostly affordable for citizens and PRs. Subpar standards? One can only blame oneself for not being able to get into a good uni.</span></p>

              <p>As my former CSM would say, outflow kee lan!  Can means can lah - no need to waste time to wayang so much. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>It's a whole lot of hypocritical bollocks anyway.  When people leave Singapore, it's because they CMI, but when they leave other places, it's because the place is bad.  Drop the bullshit and take your own medicine.</p>
