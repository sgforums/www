            <div class='col-md body'>u don't hve to know the diff cos pyramid is illegal and if what u are going into is illegal, then the guvment will stop it right? if it is MLM, the law has changed since june2000 to allow legitimate mlm companies in sg. the only thing is, which are the good companies and which one is fly by night. rule of the thumb is to join an established recognised worldwide ones.<br><br>also if someone say u can make fast bucks like 20k a week, u know that that is fake cos there must be work to be done. a simple response to these ppl is "show me ur cheque. how much u making." demand to see his cheque. if it is real, he wud hve zapped it as proof. if he can't show u, can u trust this person anymore?<br><br>however if u are still interested, i can tell u the diff  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> DuH<br><br>------------------<br>yeah yeah yeah, boogie woogie spit it out at <a href="http://www.my77thstreet.com" rel="nofollow">www.my77thstreet.com</a><br><br>Don't say I got lobang also never say!!<br><a href="http://www.sfimarketing.com/gateway/gateway.php3?163274695" rel="nofollow">http://www.sfimarketing.com/gateway/gateway.php3?163274695</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MLM is legal..Pyramid selling is illegal...there're some guidelines in indentifying the difference....to name some:<br><br>1) Pyramid pay out commission on asking pple to join in, unlike u get commission by selling the pdts<br><br>2) U have to pay the pdts and assume all the risk of not able to sell them away under pyramid selling<br><br>3) Eventually the base of the pyramid will be too big and will collaspe, cos the commission is not enuff for lower base..</div>

Both of them are direct marketing selling directly to consumers without overheads such as rentals, advertisements, middlemen, delivery costs, staff costs, CPF etc<br><br>They use ordinary people and by word of mouth to market the products. No sale, no pay which is a fair system instead of employing sales people and incurring the overheads<br>above, no sale still gotta pay, so companies sometimes go bust.<br><br>That being the case, they can actually market very good superior products and pay handsome commision to distributors because of the tremendous costs savings.<br><br>In the past, pyramids and fly by night companies masquerading as MLM companies exploited this advantage and conned people.<br><br>Eversince the law was ammended in June 2000 and reviewed in Jan 2002, legitimate MLM companies can now operate in Singapore subject to very strict guidelines inter alia namely :-<br><br>1) It must not be touted as a get rich quick scheme.<br><br>2) Distributors must not be coerced to be loaded with goods which they cannot move.<br><br>3) Goods must not be too expensive which one would not purchase in any ordinary circumstances.<br><br>4) The companies must be transparent in their payments to distributores and must be able to declare the average income of its distributors.<br><br>5) Consumers are protected with 100% money back guarantee within 60days from purchase.<br><br>Below are my own personal opinion why the goverment suddenly allows MLM for the following reasons :-<br><br>1) There are many self made millionaires through MLM all over the world and this is to give Singaporeans to have more opportunities.<br><br>2) As this is a virtually little initial investment start up, many people can make a living, especially those that are retrenched or are unskilled.<br><br>3) Since many MLM companies are global in nature, eg Nuskin, Pharmanex, Amway...etc, it is now for Singaporeans to gain foreign income by networking overseas too. The fear that with China's entry into the WTO, foreign investments will shift there and many Singaporeans will be unemployed and the economy will suffer. In the past, Singaporeans had suffered huge financial losses in China, now its our turn to bring income back to Singapore by our marketeer entreprenuers to go there and bring money back without having to have huge financial resourses to start off and thus carrying a little risks. Sounds simple? Yes and that is why many people do not believe in the power of network marketing.<br><br>Many people will only make a few hundred dollars or 2-3 thousand per month. However, with a great sensible marketing plan, fortunes too had been made.<br><br>As said earlier, like any businesses, money do not drop down from the sky. Some work and ingenuity is required. However, since it is almost a no risk venture, it is worth considering isn't it?<br><br>Please ask for a business plan and training syllabus before you join any company. Mark my words. Training is crucial to your success as there are many people who made it, just copy what they do through training. What for reinvent the wheel and waste all the resources until you give up?  If they only ask you to sell sell sell and recruit recruit recruit, then you can't make much, although you can make some pocket money. How many bottles of products can you sell a day? How many people can you recruit to help you sell? Limited, isn't it? Anyway, Singapore do not allow companies to pay on recruitment as that will be pyramid and pyramid is illegal. In otherwords, goods must move. So those you've recruited must also sell. How many will do that. Most of them just go to sleep, don't they?<br><br>One more important thing I must stress. When someone invites you to join him, ask for his pay cheque to see how much he earns. If he himself made little, how is he gonna teach you how to make more? If you want to join, lookout for a succesful upline, then he can teach you how to be as successful as him and with some ingenuity on your part, you may even make more than him, right?<br><br>You don't see Bill Gates selling computers don't you? He builds business. So to be very successful in any business, building it with a plan is the key. If selling and recruiting being the only activities, then one will only be a salesman and that will not bring you financial wealth.

Sad to say, the reality is slightly different.<br><br>I was "recruited" by one such MLM a few weeks ago. During the talk, the speaker said all the things about being legal and not being a pyramid selling scheme, about working hard and making the big bucks quickly.<br><br>Later on, someone took me aside to tell me everything in more detail. A few things struck me as odd.<br><br>First, she wanted to know very much my opinion of the company's products. Well, I figured that since they were hiring me to sell their products, does it matter what I think?<br><br>Second, whilst explaining the company's products, I realised that the manner in which she was doing so was not as a boss would to an employee, but as a seller would to a buyer.<br><br>Last, there came a point when she was talking about the actual selling of the company's product. She mentioned two points: Personal selling, and personal commitment. The former she dismissed out of hand immediately. The latter was heavily emphasized upon.

That is already against the law which clearly stated that people who joined must not be coerced by get rich quick schemes. Sure, there are people who have done that, but that is not a representation of the majority.<br><br>In network marketing, there is no boss or employee cos everyone is their own boss and their results dictate their income. That is why the companies do not pay CPF as every distributor is not an employee, but a business owner in their own right.<br><br>Fair enough if your friend wants to know what do you think of the products as if you do not believe the products are good, then how do you market something if you doubt that it can benefit you?<br><br>Between selling and commitment, if you are to do business and there is no commitment to the business, then can you be successful? If you want to start a business, don't you think you want partners to be committed or do you just want them to try try? It is a carreer to many people and their livelihood depends on it. They cannot just try try right? Anyway in business, try try will die die. Why else will 80% of all startups fail before 5 years?<br><br>Success do not come by chance. Even lottery you hve to queue to buy and only one in a million you strike top price.<br><br>In business or in most things one do in life,  with committment and single minded purpose to make it succeed , we then stand a better chance to get the results we want don't we?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> DuH<br><br>------------------<br>yeah yeah yeah, boogie woogie spit it out at <a href="http://www.my77thstreet.com" rel="nofollow">www.my77thstreet.com</a></div>
