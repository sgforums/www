That means no shop front, but using ordinary people to move products.<br><br>To take it a step futher, traditional business is even more pyramid.<br><br>Look at the banks and factories retrenching now. The structure looks something like this.<br><br>One one CEO.<br><br>CEO<br>8 Board Of Directors<br>20 Divisional/Branch Managers<br>50 Supervisors and asst. managerial<br>3000 workers eg. factoryoperators, tellers<br><br>Now, who made all the money? People at the top isn't it?<br><br>Who gets retrenched? People at the bottom isn't it?<br><br>If a factory operator is smarter than the CEO, what are his chances of being propmoted to one? Almost zilch isn't it? If he doen't heve a degree, being a manager could even be a problem although he may be smarter, agree?<br><br>In MLM, if the people you sponsored produce more than you, he can make more than you and even have an organisation bigger than yours. Isn't that a fairer system? What's more, if you tell somebody on top you want to make more than them, they will be more willing to help you cos they also profit from your success. That means, office politiking is thrown out of the window too.<br><br>This is also a chance for ordinary people to have a premanent income. Why? As long as somebody repeats order or make a sale under your organisation(subject to law of 6 levels) , you get paid. Forever, unless they are outlawed or the company went bust. So in order to protect yourself from the latter, do choose a strong company if you intend to join. That is why MLM companies are so fastidious  that must have good products   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> DuH<br><br>------------------<br>yeah yeah yeah, boogie woogie spit it out at <a href="http://www.my77thstreet.com" rel="nofollow">www.my77thstreet.com</a><br><br>[This message has been edited by blurblop (edited 17 February 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>blurblop is right. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Pyramid or MLM or Network marketing or what ever you call it you name it, is just a name. It is not the shape of an triangle that make it illegal, it is the things people do that make it illegal.<br><br>Stop guessing but visit the site of MTI - Singapore Ministry Of Trade And Industrial, search for multi level marketing. Mr Benjamin Tan, Chairman, Direct Selling Association of Singapore pointed out an example of illegal pyramid schemes like S888.com. Participants had to pay S$27,000 to S888 to join the scheme, and once they join, they receive a fixed commission of S$3000 for every addition member they recruited. Point to note, there is no Goods or services involve. When recruitment become harder, the bubble burst and the people below the triangle lost all their life saving.<br><br>To sustain long in this business, I choose a company that their products I like and even though without recruitment, which is not easy, I still earn through selling the products. If you have the mentality of joining MLM to recruit as many people in short time in order to earn a lot of money (or the primitive pyramid mentality), you chance of surviving in this business is 0%.<br><br>Read RichDadPoorDad, Robert Kiyosaki emphasize the benefit of MLM in the sence of character building which involve public specking, selling and human relationship etc, and not just making money where money will come along the way. Joining MLM don't put you in the I quadrant.<br><br>To be frank, I have just started not long and not very successful in this business at the moment, so I wish myself luck as well as to all of you who are in this business and who plan to join in.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

U want to sell products then u sell, if u wannna remain as consumer , then juz remain as consumer.<br><br>A little more abt my co. , the big boss  come up with a very good product and own his factories, fully paid with cash.the co. oversees the whole production process . That's why he can pass on the savings to direct consumers.This towkay likes to give people with entrepreneurial spirit but no $$$, to be their own boss.This is like ur own biz.And its products earn awards .<br><br>furthermore, this company is debt-free , unlike other co. which have high gearing ratio.<br><br>If the products are good, pple will come back for more.
