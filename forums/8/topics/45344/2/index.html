I probably was expecting something mindblowing again this time when i watched matrix reloaded ... tat's why i was disappointed when i saw reloaded ... hai ..<br>but stilll i tink matrix reloaded is good juz tat probably now the characters seem more superhuman than ever ...<br>I mean in matrix1, they could jump across buildings ... "by freeing your mind" but now Neo can "FLY" ... i juz tink it gets too incredulous and undetached from our life ...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well here is wat i see from the movie...<br><br>Key makers- he is a guy that make the so call "keys" to backdoors. The guy that contain him wanted him because he is able to access every door he wanted.<br><br>The french guy- a progamme  that defies the matrix, have a mind of his own. He desire power in the matrix thus hold the key with him. He gather all those  progamme like him  the twin brothers and those villians. He is good in coming out "evil" progamme like the  cake while he need the twins and villians to protect him from the agents.<br><br>agents-A special prmgamme to delete any intruders or progamme from the matrix.<br><br>Matrix-a progamme to lock human into a dream world. The first matrix is a failure thus the machine study the human history and start to redesign after the 5th one. They put human into a history of year 2000 where the matrix is near perfection.<br><br>Neo-So called the "the one" When matrix first design, neo role is design to destroy the whole matrix so that a new one can be reloaeded. Neo is a virus, thats why agent smith become a free agent when nero go pass him (remember the last scene during part 1)he pass his virus capability to agent smith .<br><br></div>
