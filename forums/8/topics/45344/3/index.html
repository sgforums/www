They are supposed to keep the Keymaker in place... Thus, as they are made by the program... They have more ablities that agents who are placed in the matrix by "mainframe".<br></blockquote>No the twins like the werewolves are previous versions of the agents that managed to get into the matrix even after their real form was deleted.Much like what Agent smith is now<br><blockquote><br>As for the maker of the matrix...<br>What he is trying to say that history had repeated itself for the 6ixth time... The Matrix is a system has been repeating itself... The machines need energy to live on... but they cannot  have tooo many humans... or they might juz be wiped out... thus... they created a story... a lie... "The One" to end the war...  But in actual fact... in the matrix... "The One" job is to select few person to restart the whole real world and matrix... so that the energy source will not be wiped out nor will it grow too powerful.<br></blockquote>no the job of the One is to help the matrix work out the bugs.1% of the population will reject the programming so it is up to the few ppl that survive to find those free them and wait for the next "the one" who will once again reveal the flaw in the program...thus the process will repeat<br><blockquote><br>The old lady...<br>she is the oracle... another program in the "mainframe". thus having living in the matrix 6 time... and being a programme... have the ablity to tell and read the future. Both the Keymaker and Serepah ( the white guy protecting the Oracle) are also programs.<br></blockquote>The oracle is another program(she is known as the mother of the matrix)I'm not sure what she does but i think her job is to fine the 1 and set him on the path towards finding the bug/problem that makes people reject the matrix<br><blockquote><br>There might be some confusion about Agent Smith.<br>Smith is no longer a agent... He was "freed" when Neo killed him... In terms of programming... he was deleted... however, in the storyline, programs like Smith (agents) can hide in the "mainframe" to prevent getting deleted. Smith somehow did that... AND also found a way to overwrite and copy programs. In another words, copy himself. Thus, he returned to the matrix and copied himself, trying to find back Neo for revenge and overtaking the whole "Matrix" programme.</blockquote>When Agent Smith was killed he was deemed obsolete by the creator/source and was thus repalced.But he managed to exlie himself before that happened.<br><blockquote><br>About the storyline, its basically very simple... Few points.<br>- Neo is the The One<br>- Smith is no longer a agent, able to copy, overwrite.<br>- Smith able to take over a human mind.<br>- Senitals are forcing into Zion, human race at risk.<br>- Neo need to get to mainframe to stop them. To kill(hang) Matrix.<br>- Keymaker is the only one that can show Neo the door.<br>- Programs "defy" mainframes, like virus.<br>- Neo is able to "foresee"<br>- Neo meets the "creator" of matrix.<br>- Neo is the 6th version of himself. History is repeating.<br>- Love is changing this Neo. He made the choice to save Trinity and a chance that human can survive.<br>- Neo saved Trinity, changed the history.<br>- Biological change in Neo.<br>- Neo able to control machines as though in the Matrix in the Real World.<br></blockquote>Neo did not change history by saving Trinity.It was suppose to happen that way.Neo is no suppose to crash the matrix.Cause if he did then system shut down and every1 dies but Zion is saved.If he chooses to save trinity Zion is screwed but the matrix can be rebuilt.<br>Not to sure about this though ehhe might need to watch it again to fully understand.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>SPOILER ALERT<br><br>Well here's my take on the Matrix Reloaded:<br><br>The earlier versions of the Matrix failed due to imperfections in the system. As the Architect (the old man in the tv room) told Neo, due to 1% rejecting the Matrix, previous versions of the Matrix broke down, but the Oracle came up with a new way of managing this:<br>From time to time, the imbalances result in one person chosen as The One to reset the Matrix and rebuild Zion. Maybe the machines themselves could not reset the Matrix, so needed to get a human to do that, hence The One.<br><br>Thus the Sentinels invade Zion to force The One to make the choice that will allow humans to survive as a race, in a new Zion. This is the carrot that is dangled to ensure he make the choice which the machines want.<br><br>Not sure how many earlier versions of the Matrix there were, but there were already 5 "The One" who had chosen the door on the right, which will allow them to choose the people to rebuild Zion with. Neo is different from them because of his love for Trinity which caused him to choose the other door, different from the previous 5 .<br><br>The Oracle and the Keymaker are programmes written for the purpose of getting The One to restart the Matrix so that both the machines and humans continue to survive. The French guy is a rogue program, just as Agent Smith is now a rogue program, with a mind of his own, no longer following the rules that and the purpose they were written for.<br><br>For most of the people, there is no choice, which is why the Oracle could predict what will happen. Only a few with the power have the choice: The French guy, Agent Smith, Neo. The rest just serve their purpose, human and program alike.<br><br>The lines between the real world and the Matrix are blurring, so Agent Smith could copy himself into the real world to betray the humans, while Neo can stop the Sentinels.<br><br>The "mistakes" in the plot are hooks to allow Part 3 to explain everything.<br><br>The Matrix Revolutions will probably explain everything and bring a final end to the Matrix.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i just watched the show yesterday.. i think the show can be interpreted in another as what has been posted..<br>WARNING: it may confuse you more...<br><br>the show is essentially a war between the machines and the humans..<br><br>the ppl in zion have already escaped from the machine's control.. the machines have taken over the world and they control the human minds by creating a virtual world which is the matrix.. humans are a source of energy to keep the matrix running.. the oracle's prophecy is that Neo is the one that will destroy the matrix and the machines..<br><br>the machines does exist in the real world.. but the only way, according to the prophecy (which was a lie), to destroy the matrix is to enter the matrix and destroying the source.. a direct confrontation is not possible because the machines are far too superior than humans..<br><br>the  oracle, agent smith, twins, french guy, keymaker, agents are all programs in the virtual world.. in fact everything in the matrix is a program, including the birds, the trees, and the wind, etc.. each and everything has a purpose.. and each program are interlinked.. some programs are renegades, some are controlled by the matrix..<br><br>i believe the architect is controlled by the matrix and all that he told Neo at the source is a lie.. that is to say, there are no previous versions of the matrix.. we have to look at the difference between humans and machines.. machines or even artificial intelligence must be given a set of rules to think.. even for artificial intelligence, they are still thinking within a set of data and rules.. machines/programs are ultimately made of loops and cycles.. however humans are capable of thinking out of a loop.. they live life in linear time.. the architect is trying to lie to Neo that the matrix cannot be destroyed and Zion cannot be saved and that everything he does will be in vain..<br><br>for those who stayed at the end of the movie, the trailers of revolutions started by saying, "for everything that has a beginning, has an end".. that i feel is also another essence.. that is, human history began from beginning of time and therefore there must be s conclusion and life does not go in circles.. as opposed to what the architect has said..<br><br>i think Neo fulfilling the prophecy was just a coincidence.. but the beauty is that the human race when pushed in to adversity has always risen to the ocassion.. which i think would be the main theme in matrix revolutions..</div>
