Smith saved Neo ... cause he wanted to kill Neo himself ... remember b4 the fight scene of a hundred Smiths and Neo he was talking about purpose of living ???

            <div class='col-md body'>My mainframe thoughts lie with Lurker... My idea's very much the same as his... Except a minority of the conclusion perhaps a little different...?<br><br>I think the 2 main issues quite debatable would be...<br><br>1. What happened at the 'Source' when Neo chose between the 2 doors.<br><br>2. How can Neo stop the machines in REAL world?<br><br>Before I begin, just would like to state that followings are just my PERSONAL views. At this point, many much are POSSIBLE... What we're doing here are just GENERAL SPECULATIONs...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><strong>ARCHITECT</strong> I see him most probably as an IMPORTANT program in the MATRIX. Either of HIGH AUTHORITY in the central control of MATRIX or a program playing an IMPORTANT KEY in Matrix's reloading.<br><br><strong>NEO</strong> I see him as a BUG within a mainframe program THE MATRIX. As the architect mentioned that they're trying to PERFECT the system (Matrix) time over and again. That's one of the PROBLEM with programming. The more ADVANCE you are the HIGHER the chances of a BUG.<br><br><strong>ORACLE</strong> At 1st I thought of seeing her as a MEANS of which the MATRIX would use (a program) to get NEO to the SOURCE so that he could RELOAD the Matrix. Then one thing puzzles me. So I've chosen one of my 2 assumptions. She's NOT with Matrix. Like Agent Smith and the Key Holder, she's the 'werewolves &amp; vampires' which have escaped the fate of being deleted narrowly. The reason why I thought she's not with the Matrix system is because IF she's of KEY importance for Neo to reload the system (like as if this is part of the wanted 'programme' and hence outcome by the Matrix), the KEY holder SHOULD be EQUALLY IMPORTANT and not be forced to be exterminated by AGENTS.<br><br><strong>AGENT SMITH</strong> Somehow seems to have been impaired with some 'power' of Neo. Changing this program drastically. Seems to have acquired the ability to enter the real human world too?<br><br><strong>STORY</strong><br><br>I think NEO is a BUG. Not wanted but EXPECTED by the MATRIX SYSTEM. Each time THE MATRIX SYSTEM tries to PERFECT itself, a BUG would come in. This is NOT hope for, but certainly have to be ACCOUNTED for. As such said by the Architect, "We're becoming more &amp; more efficient in handling this.."<br><br>At the CHOICE of the doors, I predict 2 scenerios ( just guesses).<br><br>1st one's like Lurker's. The door to the left REBOOTS the system and the program to restart itself. Hence, 'life' would start again with the AI updating the information to CLEAR the 'BUG'. The door to the right just ISOLATES Neo into ANOTHER 'Matrix'. Not the real one but just like a simulation? Perhaps to STUDY him or something at greater depth? In this case, the reason why Neo can stop the machines is because he's still in a MATRIX.<br><br>2nd idea is that the Matrix has ALREADY BEEN RELOADED at the point where Neo reached the SOURCE. Hence 'It's not a matter of choice, as the decision has already been made.'? Neo's choice only affects at which scenerio the Matrix would continue with after the REBOOT. In this case, the reason why Neo can stop the machines is either (1) in having contact with Agent Smith, they have both exchanged 'information'. Hence Neo has gained some form of 'access' to the manipulation of the Matrix. (2) He simply has gained this 'ability' when he reached the SOURCE. Which is WHY the Architect seemed very much wanted Neo to choose the start from 'ZERO' REBOOT. Typical computer error message I guess would read something like... "Computer is going to RESTART, do you want to save the unsaved information?" Well... Something like that...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Architect: Hello Neo<br><br>Neo: Who are you?<br><br>Architect: I am the Architect. I created the Matrix. I have been waiting for you. You have many questions and although the process has altered your consciousness you remain irrevocably human, ergo some of my answers you will understand and some of them you will not. Concordantly, while your first question maybe the most pertinent you may or may not realize it is also the most irrelevant.<br><br>Neo: Why am I here?<br><br>Architect: Your life is the sum of a remainder of an unbalanced equation inherent in the programming of the matrix. You are the eventuality of an anomaly which despite my sincerest efforts I have been unable to eliminate from what is otherwise a harmony of mathematical precision. While it remains a burden deciduously avoided it is not unexpected and thus not beyond a measure of control. Which has led you inexcerably here.<br><br>Neo: You havenÂ’t answered my question.<br><br>Architect: Quite right. Interesting, that was quicker then the others.<br><br>Neo: Others? (What others? How many? Answer me)<br><br>Architect: The Matrix is older then you know. I prefer counting from the emergence of one integral anomaly to the emergence of the next. In which case this is the sixth version.<br><br>Neo: Then there are only two possible explanations, either no one told me, or no one knows.<br><br>Architect: Precisely, as you are undoubtedly gathering the anomaly is systemic. Creating fluctuations in even the most simplistic equations.<br><br>Neo: Choice, the problem is choice.<br><br>Architect: The first matrix I designed was quite naturally perfect; it was a work of art, flawless, sublime. A triumph equaled only by its monumental failure. The inevitability of its doom is apparent to me now as a consequence of the imperfection inherent in every human being. Thus, I redesigned it, based on your history to more accurately reflect the varying grotesqueries of your nature. However I was again frustrated by failure. I have since come to understand that the answer eluded me because it required a lesser mind a mind less bound by the parameters of perfection. Thus the answer was stumbled upon by another, an intuitive program, initially created to investigate certain aspects of the human psyche. If I am the father of the matrix, she would undoubtedly be its mother.<br><br>Neo: The Oracle<br><br>Architect: Please, as I was saying she stumbled upon a solution whereby nearly 99 percent of all test subjects accepted the program as long as they were given a choice, even if they were only aware of the choice at an unconscious level. While this answered function it was obviously fundamentally flawed thus creating the otherwise contradictory systemic anomaly. That if left unchecked might threaten the system itself, ergo those that refuse the program while the minority if unchecked would cause an escalating probability of disaster.<br><br>Neo: This is about Zion<br><br>Architect: You are here because Zion is about to be destroyed. Its every living inhabitant terminated, its entire existence eradicated.<br><br>Neo: Bullshit (Bullshit, Bullshit, Bullshit)<br><br>Architect: Denial is the most predictable of all human responses. But, rest assured, this will be the sixth time we have destroyed it. And we have become exceedingly efficient at it. The function of the One is now to return to the source allowing a temporary dissemination of the code you carry reinserting the prime program after which you will be required to select from the matrix 23 individuals, 16 female 7 male, to rebuild Zion. Failure to comply with this process will result in a cataclysmic system crash killing everyone connected to the matrix. Which, coupled with the extermination of Zion will ultimately result in the extinction of the entire human race.<br><br>Neo: You wonÂ’t let it happen, you canÂ’t. You need human beings to survive.<br><br>Architect: There are levels of survival we are prepared to accept. However the relevant issue is whether you are ready to accept the responsibility for the death of every human being in this world. It is interesting reading your reactions. Your 5 predecessors were by design based on a similar predication a contingent affirmation that was meant to create a profound attachment to the rest of your species facilitating the function of the One. While the others experienced this in a very general way your experience is far more specific, Vis a vie love.<br><br>Neo: Trinity<br><br>Architect: Apropo, she entered the matrix to save your life at the cost of her own.<br><br>Neo: No<br><br>Architect: Which brings us at last to the moment of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw is ultimately expressed and the anomaly revealed as both beginning and end. There are two doors, the door to your right leads to the source and the salvation of Zion, the door to your left leads back to the matrix to her and to the end of your species. As you adequately put, the problem is choice. But we already know we you are going to do donÂ’t we? Already I can see the chain reaction the chemical precursors that signal the onset of an emotion designed specifically to overwhelm logic and reason. An emotion that is already blinding you from the simple and obvious truth, she is going to die and there is nothing you can do to stop it. Hope, it is the quintessential human delusion simultaneously the source of your greatest strength and your greatest weakness.<br><br>Neo: If I were you, I would hope that we donÂ’t meet again.<br><br>Architect: We wonÂ’t.<br></div>
