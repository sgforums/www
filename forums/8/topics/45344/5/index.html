            <div class='col-md body'>Some thoughts after the show:<br><br>Difference between humans and machines:<br>Machines and programs are created for a purpose and are content to just serve out their purpose (except for the rogue programs that refused to be deleted)<br>Humans do not have this sense of purpose, and thus constantly need to make choices to make sense of their world.<br><br>Neo has already made his choice before meeting the Architect. The choice is to ensure survival of human race or to try and save Trinity, which is probably inevitable anyway.<br>The Oracle knows this, and knows what his decision will be, but Neo does not, and though he has already made the decision, he does not understand why.<br><br>Neo's powers come because he is the result of the anomaly, and as the anomaly increases, so does his powers, explaining why he is able to stop the Sentinels in "the real world" without needing to broadcast into the matrix.<br><br>Not all machines work for the same purpose. The Agents are created to police the system and to handle the anomalies (the freed minds) and are unaware of the rebooting of the matrix, or do not wish it to happen, thus they try to stop the freed humans.<br>Other programs desire the rebooting, and perhaps had been written for this purpose (The Keymaker, the oracle) and are thus hunted by the Agents. Perhaps they will also be wiped out when the matrix reboots, but that is their purpose and they are content to die.<br><br></div>
