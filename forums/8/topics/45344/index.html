            <div class='col-md body'>Er... correct me if I am wrong...<br><br>1. The Twins is a programme made by Merovingian, who himself is another programme to "protect" The Keymaker from the Agents.<br><br>2. He blabbered a lot... I found what the Architect said rather "chim" myself... but break down his words into little parts ar... you might understand better. Basically he was saying although Neo is The One, he could only save Zion and the human spieces, it isn't confirmed that he can do it.

Neo is the 6th.<br><br>Whenever they attempt to save Zion, it "reboot" the whole system. The Matrix will restart all over again. And another "The One" will show up and play the hero again. Anyway, Neo is a failed programme from The Matrix, hence he is sort of "enlightenend" and is not blinded by what may seem real.<br><br>When the Architect told him that if he chooses the right door, he will destroy The Matrix completely and free Zion, the left to save his beloved, Trinity, he already has an answer to himself. From what I see, he is only trying to confuse Neo. He didn't give Neo the confirm results, he only gave Neo a choice. Meaning... if Neo chose the left door to save Trinity, that is still a possibility to save Zion. But choosing the right may not be true, just that Trinity will definitely die.<br><br>3. Er... there are a lot of "prophecies" in the movie ar... headache. Can't remember which one the Oracle is talking about. Anyway she is also another programme in the System to "defy" The Matrix.<br><br>But... as hard as Morpheus and gang are trying to break away from the system, they are forming a system themselves. Zion is a system. They have heads, the Counsels... and crew captains. Power is inevitable, and people will always want to surpass one another.

The Twins is a programme made by Merovingian, who himself is another programme to "protect" The Keymaker from the Agents.<br><br>2. He blabbered a lot... I found what the Architect said rather "chim" myself... but break down his words into little parts ar... you might understand better. Basically he was saying although Neo is The One, he could only save Zion and the human spieces, it isn't confirmed that he can do it. Cause even if Neo does save Zion, it simply do not mean the end of The Matrix, cause before Neo, they were 5 other "The Ones". Neo is the 6th.<br><br>Whenever they attempt to save Zion, it "reboot" the whole system. The Matrix will restart all over again. And another "The One" will show up and play the hero again. Anyway, Neo is a failed programme from The Matrix, hence he is sort of "enlightenend" and is not blinded by what may seem real.<br><br>When the Architect told him that if he chooses the right door, he will destroy The Matrix completely and free Zion, the left to save his beloved, Trinity, he already has an answer to himself. From what I see, he is only trying to confuse Neo. He didn't give Neo the confirm results, he only gave Neo a choice. Meaning... if Neo chose the left door to save Trinity, that is still a possibility to save Zion. But choosing the right may not be true, just that Trinity will definitely die.<br><br>3. Er... there are a lot of "prophecies" in the movie ar... headache. Can't remember which one the Oracle is talking about. Anyway she is also another programme in the System to "defy" The Matrix.<br><br>But... as hard as Morpheus and gang are trying to break away from the system, they are forming a system themselves. Zion is a system. They have heads, the Counsels... and crew captains. Power is inevitable, and people will always want to surpass one another. Maybe that is the reason why The Matrix has restarted the past 5 times?</div></blockquote>agree, think this is bt rite... at least i oso interpret something like this, a bit diff, small diff but too lazy to write...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agree the storyline is very complicated ...<br>aniwae just some explanation i see missing ...<br><br>Yes, the 2 twins are programs that are supposed to protect the keymaker but then again they are renegade program, something like mercenaries like tat ...<br>When i mean renegade program it means tat program that is uncontrollable by the main cpu ie the matrix ... if u tink of nowdays mabbe u can consider this pple virus ??? I dunno ... hmmm ...<br>I tink the twins not dead yet .... becuz of the morphing ability ... if they die den i feel a bit lame ...<br><br>And btw anione noes how come Agent Smith unplugs from the system once Neo puts his body in him (in matrix 1) ... and how come Neo can save Trinity juz by putting his hand in her ?<br>So now Agent Smith is another who wants to destroy the Matrix ? to free himself ? his part i a bit confused ...<br>becuz Smith becomes an enemy of the Agents, the part where many Smiths were fighting Neo, he actually "killed" the agents ...<br><br>The French Guy ??? I tink he is one of the few programs who understand what the matrix is all about ba ? tat's why he can do tat thing to the girl eating the chocolate cake ?<br><br>Matrix Reloaded i find a bit qua zhang ... becuz Neo can fly ... and then Morpheus and Trinity like suddenly become damn strong .. they can fight the Agents in combat ... remember in Matrix 1 where they alwiz run whenever they see an agent, none dared to fight the agent .... But then in reloaded, morpheus even had a combat on the truck with the Agent, pretty incredible !<br><br>Nonethless ... Matrix Reloaded effects are still stunning but i think the storyline getting too hard to handle ...</div>
