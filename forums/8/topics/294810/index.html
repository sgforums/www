            <div class='col-md body'>I always read and hear people saying things like "The company only pay me 2k a month. So low pay. What for I work so hard for them"<br><br>Many thoughts came across my mind when I hear these statements.<br><br>"2k is considered low pay? How many thousands of ppl in singapore are getting less than 2k a month and you are still complaining?"<br><br>"What qualifications and experience do you have to say that 2k a month is low?<br>If you are a degree holder with lots of experience than I agree that 2k is low.<br>If you are a degree holder and a fresh graduate I will say that 2k is ok.<br>If you are a diploma holder with lots of experience 2k is a ok salary too<br>If you are a diploma holder and a fresh graduate 2k is considered as a high salary.<br>If you are holding O level and below qualification, I will say that 2k is a VERY HIGH SALARY ALREADY<br><br>"Are you doing alot of work and free OT for the company? If not, you still got the cheek to complain that 2k is low? If yes I agree that you have the right to complain"<br><br>"What positions are you holding in the company? If you are holding a low position, than why are you still complaining that 2k is low?"<br><br>"Are you really that good? I doubt so. If you are really that good and you find 2k a month is low salary, why don't you resign to find a better job? You say 2k a month is low and yet you never go and find a higher salary job. Is it because you know that you are lousy and you can't find a better job outside so you lan lan suck thumb stay in the company and everyday complain and demoralise the other staffs too?<br><br>Perhaps it is time for these people to reflect on themself before they complain that their salary is low.<br><br></div>
