            <div class='col-md body'>HEy ppl.. think this whole issue has become quite fairly heated and we seem to be missing the point.<br><br>On my part, I feel that regardless of equality, it is a person's slef-right whether she/he would want to marry a person of the same social status. It's a choice. That's all. Not all SG girls subscribe to such a notion, neither do all SG men.<br><br>I think what Ms Low was trying to drive at is to help promote marriages within Singaporeans, and she's just probably saying it as she sees. No absolute wrong or right. It's truee that both man and woman have to market themselves well. Do we not always try to dress our best when we go for our dates? Is that not "trying to make ourselves more attractive"?<br><br>And seriously, marriage is not such a simple thing that we only need to consider love. Money does play a part too! Who's going to fund the education of the kids, the HDB flat... (and the list goes on). So rather than just calling ppl names like 'gold-digger', ask if we can trully survive on love and fresh air.<br><br>Last point I wanna make is, consider if the two ppl are of the same intellect. I'm not saying that a person who earns less has poor intellect. Not true. But remember, we're talking about first impressions.<br><br>Have a good week. Cheers!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[quote]Originally posted by Poopie-Head:<br><span style="color: blue;"><br>Yes, getting $800 per mth is very bad, nobody wants to be poor. And I think you are grossly mistaken here - it is NOT the guys who want their partners to slog for them while they enjoy life. I don't think the idea of xiao bai lian is very attractive nor is it popular to guys in general. What you are saying relates more to the typical girl mentality. It is the typical woman's idea to depend on the guy for income while she juz sits at home and be a tai tai. If the guy earns enough then all is good, but unfortunately this is not how it is for the majority, esp in SG. In this modern times, sg girls get the same education and same job opportunities as the guys, yet when it comes to choosing a partner, $$ comes in as very high or even top priority. Is this the kind of mentality we want? Nevertheless, this is the typical type of thinking our people have, and it has come to the point that it is widely accepted and taken as being the "right" kind of attitude. </span><br><br>I have to point out that not every girl wants to sit at home and be a tai tai as well. Put it this way, there are the black sheep among the girls and the guys so can we just drop this topic because we will not get anywhere. All I can say is that everyone wants to feel secure financially because with this, we can move ahead without having to think where our next meal comes from. With the high living expenses we have here, usually it has to be a fair share of both work and housework between the couple. That's the norm. Just because the media chooses to nitpick on certain individuals, we get a lets bash SG girls here in the forum.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><br>What I hear and see, it is completely the opposite of yours. Women file for divorce soon after the hubby goes bankrupt or out of work. Remember the no. of divorce cases shot up during the low employment periods? How many women will be willing to slog together with her hubby in his times of poverty? Not many. </span><br><br><span style="color: black;">There we go again, the problem with statistics is that they show part of the story. What about those who did? Does anyone even appreciate them for doing it?</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Your comment about men expecting their wives to help out, I think this is very understandable. In times of need, the guy is probably down and out, and being married and taken the vows, isn't it only right that the wife helps out for this period of time? If it is the wife who went out of job, don't you think she will expect the hubby to support the family? Or do you think it is only right for the hubby to file for divorce? Marriage means the two persons go through thick and thin TOGETHER, yet many girls will run off at the very thought of the guy being out of work. Very practical indeed. Some people can even comment to the guys to only come back to them when they have succeeded. Is this the kind of attitude we expect in our society now?</span><br><br><span style="color: black;">Like I said, drop this topic. There will be stories of the girl running away when the tough gets going, but there are also plenty of stories of girls sacrificing for the guy to find him leaving for another woman. Because with her help he is up in society and can get someone better. Again, this applies to both sexes, its only a matter of which is highlighted more often and seen. Its a never ending debate.</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">As for "Taking things for granted, cannot 'make noise', docile cow" are very bad indeed, but I think these are individual cases, it's true that these kind of thinking are very undesirable indeed. I only hope that this is not the attitude of the majority of the guys here. Also, wives/GFs (and vice versa) being encouraging instead of "rubbing the salt in" or "stepping on it" on the guys would be a better alternative isn't it? We must understand that being out of job or failing in your career is very depressing.</span><br><br><span style="color: black;">I agree with you. A relationship is like a partnership. Both parties have to respect and support each other in times of need</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;"><br>I dunno what kind of ideas you get from the forum here, but I believe these ungrateful attitude is hugely exaggerated. Where exactly did u get the ideas of guys being <span style="font-style: italic;">ungrateful</span> people from anyway?<br><br>On the other hand, from this thread alone, what I can see is that the people who voiced their views on the typical materialistic and "practical" attitudes of the women in SG are labelled as "whiners". Is commenting on the current "trend" and attitudes of our women being "whiney"? If so, I guess the gers only want to hear all the good things about themselves, much like in a marriage, they only want to be well-fed and comfy and leave at the slightest chance of poverty. Who doesn't want all the good things in life?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br></span><br><br><span style="color: black;">I have the say that if it was put in a constructive way, there will be no outcry at all.In another thread a guy put it very constructivly. It was a very mature well-written argument. However, alot of the same people who keep posting do whine. They complain about the situation they are in or we perceive they are in and just push the blame to the other party. If you don't call that whining, I don't know what else to call it. Put it this way, materialisim is rampant in any city and it does not apply to girls only. Also, the issue is also very much on what the media focuses on. </span><br></div>

Please, do read my post carefully.<br><br>If you want to hear about the comments about the current trends, there are also plenty of posts by the girls on their point of views about the guys.

It can be seen this way as well.<br><br>Like I said, both parties have their faults, so we either live with it or we live without it or marry a foreigner!

            <div class='col-md body'>Aiyoh, all stop whining lah....guys, marry a foreign girl, like me....I'm so happy I ditched my SG gf who was so whiny and expected me to buy her Prado bags when I was slogging thru NS on a corporal's pay....just leave the SG bitches alone and marry out of Singapore. If possible, migrate too....<br><br>I have my own software company and pull in about $7k a month (in Singapore currency equivalents), my wife pulls in about $5k. We save everything she earns, and live purely on my salary only, and nothing more. No disuputes, no quarrels. I suppose it is also fortunate that I found someone that is not materialistic, that works hard and supportive. She finds it heart-pain to buy a $100 bag....what a far cry from that SG bitch that bled me dry during my younger years....and she is not the only one....all the SG girls I've come across are very similar...all have this "princess" mentality...buy this for me, buy that for me, you foot the bill....makes me sick and therefore I have a very, very poor impression of SG girls and I am never going back!<br><br>I think it stems from the comfortable lifestyle that people have had in the last 20 years. With a booming economy and security, Singaporeans haven't felt the brunt of uncertainty in times of economic peril until recently. You feed a puppy canned food when it is young, it will refuse dry food when it gets older.<br><br>The solution? Everyone marry out of the country. ALL WILL BE HAPPY!

            <div class='col-md body'><br>I must say I have learn a lot from the more mature and better crowd through this discussion. However, as to someone asking about what constitude constructive feedback, I am sure you see a lot from and most are not finger pointing sort. As for the whining sort of post from the whiny sort of persons, just look at the whiner who married a foreigner and finger pointed that all local girls are whatever whatever. I wonder if he has acted like a ATM and been a jerk as well to get that kind of girls attracted to him. Everything has 2 ways and 2 sides. So may I ask the person who asked why we term people as whiners and others as contructive. Look at the post, by that guy, Is that constructive feedback or whining/finger pointing?<br><br>There are a lot of fair comments up there and the MPs are not perfect people. The blue collars are essential to our economy as the white collars and no one is better.  The choice to do what with one's life should be dictated by oneself and maybe, being blue collar is one's wish and living a simple life is one's choice. Then would it not be easier to look for a girl/guy who suits and do not look down on that kind of lifestyle. Most people look for someone and try to change and force the person to fit or even lie about many things just to get the person, get married and then leave when things are bad. I think its not a matter of social standing, sometimes its a matter of the social maturity and expectation towards, love, life, and family.<br><br></div>
