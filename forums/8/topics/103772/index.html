            <div class='col-md body'>Well said well done! Actually I find that to want better things in life is okie. Its the same for both genders sometimes. I think the problem with our local ladies is that they are too <strong><span class="large">hypocritical</span></strong> which makes them pretty disgusting from my point of view.<br><br>Many of them like you said want to act like as if they don't mind guys without money when that is not actually the case. I personally know of girls with honours degree triple timing and even worse to see who can give her a better life.<br><br>Prehaps why some of our men go for foreign ladies is that they are honest and are not afraid to say what they want in life. Example China women. Some of them are actually pretty honest in saying that they want a better life for themselves. But then again maybe our gals act like that cause they are frighten they might scare away potential "invesments"<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Marco_Simone:</div><div class="quote_body">My answer is No.<br><br>Ms Low said: 'We need to consider if they have the financial ability to start a family.'

It would only be more difficult for the man to support a family when he can barely support himself. Yes, marriage should be about love but love alone cannot sustain the day to day needs of the family.<br><br><blockquote>What's more imperative is to help them 'upgrade' themselves so that they become more attractive to women who want their husbands to be steady breadwinners </blockquote>LOL, in this day and age with women becoming more independant and striving for the same benefits as men, that statement should be disregarded.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I have not read anything on th e papers yet. But I did heard from some of my friends mentioned about this.<br><br>My perceptions are as follows:<br>1. Singapore men, being Asian, then to feel that they are the sole breadwinnder of the household. If they are not, ego problem may kick in. This has nothing to do with being chauvinistic as many do not look down on women.<br>2. Women nowadays are pretty independent and can live with or without men. Yet most I know wants to settle down instead of being a spinster.<br>3. Both men and women are materialistic. But judging from the looks of articles that can be found all around, it seems that women are of some percentage higher than men in this. This is also why when people talked about 5Cs they usually meant for guys. "Stable careers" are meant to relate to  guys but seldom to women. Most dating websites will say that women looking for love wants their men to have a stable or high flying jobs<br><br>Based on the above, or maybe more, Miss Low perhaps is trying to create some chance for the public to view these people as hardworking and loving husbands-to-be. Perhaps she is basing her view as a woman that wants her man to be in that circle of preference. That goes to show that to her, men should be the breadwinnder and women do look down on men who cannot provide for them.<br></div>

And I think the important factor should not be based on who is the 'bigger breadwinner'. That is a very simplistic view. Even ex-housewife divorcees get $$ every month from their ex-husbands, that goes to show being a housewife/hubby is still contributing to the household in another way. However, it is interesting to note that in singapore, ex-househusband divorcees will not get any $$. Gives u a good idea what kinda equal system we have currently. I guess the idea is that the househusband is not contributing to the household AT ALL.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>If women are truely obligated to serving the nation and society the same way as men, and also the laws and society are to treat both sexes equal, then yeah, I'm all for it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

This is to ensure the children's future generation do not get married to each other. When the parents's gene is similar, there is a great likelihood that their children will b abnormal.</div>

If u know the chinese way of classifying the relatives, it is more thorough than other system that i know of. I didn't make much study of this, but I believe in studying the chinese system to understand how far downline the mother's side whether marriage is possible.</div>

Chinese are patrilinear in culture unless in the old days, the girl richer than the boy - then he take her surname but he lose alot of face. Minangkabau malays, some native american clans (cherokees especially) are matrilinear - they take on the mother's side<br><br>Both sides same genetic risks when  it comes down to the mating game.
