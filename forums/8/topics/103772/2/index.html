            <div class='col-md body'><br>All You need in this site Someone mis-interprete and everyone jump into the bandwagon to female bash. Singapore is also better off without men who act like whiny immmature sour grapes. Go ask Malaysian girls who had dated Singapore guys for their honest opinion of local boys. I am sure you will not get rave reviews. For any general comments, you can only reflect weather the comments apply or not and think if it was true of oneself and shake it off if it does not apply. Obviously the local guys take everything personally as if their egos are bruised when someone mention upgrading is needed.  If someone sincerely gives a general feedback to help you improve and all the guys can say is that we are god's gift to the local women, so who should be surprised when some blah-chalors remain bachalors to the end of their lonely days.<br><br>A example: If I tell you studies is only the start of your lifelong education process would you believe me? or would you say, you do not want to study anymore and you want to stay status quo and hope the world turn around and suit you. This is the essence of the message. The message applies to the girls as well.<br><br>The local guys who marry all the way down to some village girl is playing the same game as a Chinese Landlord of the "Feng Jian" times (similar to the show : Da Hong Deng Long Gao Gao Gua) and using money due to the stronger curreny to "slap" the poorer village girl in the face and take advantage of her not so ideal situation where she has no choice but to bear with the local boars. So who is the one with the double standards and old school thinking. These guys are in every sense worse than the crappers in the parliment.<br><br>Let me swing the other way and tell you what I think of the local men. Generally, local guys want, sweet obedient house slaves for free s.e.x. and not to put any effort into a relationship but simply a trasactions to fulfil his carnal needs and take care of him like his personal maid where he do not need to provide for anything. Furthermore, now there is a requirement for the personal maid to make $ and share his financial load cause guys now like to spend $ on himself and he hopes that the maid will help defer some payments for him. When he is happy, he will find a new younger maid cause he always thinks he's the best thing that happen to women. This is true of some guys but its making a general statement of all guys. So is it fair when the same is said by the immature boys around here of the total female crowd. Can you say that your own mother, sisters, friends, nieces, coursins, etc are the shallow creatures you all describe.<br><br>The younger local people are such a protected group who had not suffered. I can only hope that life give them some challenges that they will grow up to be better people.<br><br></div>

I support myself and live on my own personal income, no support from any guy. I know other girls like me as well. So how?  Does all girls act like your sister or is it because your family brought her up to expect this kind of lifestyle from her future husband? So don't you think you play a part in her thinking as she plays a part in your views.<br><br>You mean the local men not $$-brained? Some men's life long dream is to marry a rich beautiful girl so that he can relax one corner for the rest of his life. You mean the guys don't like material things, don't like to enjoy or have new clothes.<br>Get real lah. Guys are just as materialistic as the girls nowadays. The girls admit it and simply say we have changed, life/living have changed. The guys are the real Ku Niang. Expect the girls to be like their mothers and take care of them and yet deny when people tell them, times are different and cannot take it when people inform them, they are materalistic and soft people who cannot take hardship.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>All I read from what the MP is saying is that to stay relavant in today's society, the lower educated guys will have to continue to upgrade themselves if they want to be able to find a girl who will accept them. They are not saying that if you don't have money, don't marry, but to increase your chances, its best that you upgrade yourself. It wouldn't be fair to the kid anyways if both parents can hardly make ends meet!<br><br>Put it this way, every guy or girl wants the best for their future and happiness. If the local guy/girl cannot meet your needs, please do look for foreigners. The pet peeve I have currently, is that some guys here who have a huge ego and confidence problem does nothing but keep bashing the SG girl, without some self-reflection.<br><br>Maybe its the old time saying of "Survival of the Fittest" that even when choosing partners, you look for the best, call it gene selection, whatever. You can call us girls materialistic or whatever, but assuming that you're a girl and you have two great guys going after you. One a garbage collector and the other a banker. Which would you choose??? Sure, happiness is a key to it but with everyone being used to the finer things in life, the least thing you want is to be 'hungry'. Sure, I don't mind being a housewife, forsaking my career but my husband better be able to keep up with my lifestyle. Call it selfish and materialistic but that's how the world turns baby. Its the same everywhere. Think of it this way. Why do China and Vietnamnese girls want to marry out of their country?<br><br>If the girl works, the guy has to be prepared to chip in their fair share of housework as well (which a lot are not willing too from experience), instead of plopping down in front of the TV, watching soccer,eating snacks, drinking beer and scratching their balls.<br><br>To be fair, there are really nice SG guys but its the whiners that really stands out.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Way to go, Elindra!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I have career aspirations, am pretty ambitious at times, and work very hard to support myself.  Whilst I will marry for love, and not because I'm eyeing some guy's fat wallet, I do not want to be 'burdened' by some whiner who does not work hard, complains a lot, has a bad attitude about life, does not seek to improve himself and does not enjoy learning for the sake of an innate interest in bettering himself and all he talks about day and night is 'chiobu's, neh neh sizes, and 'Zaogeng's.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>In short, in my previous career, I worked hard to reach the Self-Actualisation stage, although I wasn't earning a mega salary, I was easily contented.  Now, in my new career, I'm struggling but I'll reach there again someday.  I definitely do not want a guy who's happy to stay at Stage 1 or 2, where you're concerned with food, shelter, survival, sex.  I'm attracted to the intellectuals and those with a zest for life who aspire to be the best they can be.  To me, the mind is the sexiest organ!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Sometimes, it might seem as if Singapore girls are only going after the money.  To be fair, I know a lot of girls who have that kind of thinking, but not all of us like that.  I will marry a man for his character and values and will struggle with him to build our family (and my ex boyfriend can darn testify that I struggled a lot with him and stood by him when he decided to return to school mid-career) BUT I will not be hitched with losers and whiners and by a coincidental stroke of luck, those people, with their attitudes, happen to always be in the lower salary band.</div>

He does not earn as much as I do but he is studying and he seems to know where he wants to do in life and he is making plans for his life INSTEAD OF whining about how POOR he is. He is financially independent as he is willing to do any honest work for money while studying.<br>I respect him for that.<br></div>

If most guys get to where they are, they are usually too smart to fall for those parlour tricks. Maybe thats why some rich guys got so many women in their life. They cannot trust them and as such do not want to make the mistake of trusting them. Even our local entrepreneur Mr Sim said before that if he want to marry must open his eyes BIG BIG.

            <div class='col-md body'>i guess what the article said is taken out of context... when i read it, it seemed to me that it was imperative for singaporean men to boost their financial ability in order to start a family... not that singaporean men had to be rich to support a family, the most important thing is sufficiency. in the article, it cites examples of blue collar workers earning 1000++ a month, below the 2000 level. hw r you going to buy a hse, have kids with this kind of income? where is the financial security from marrying such income earners? some women may not look down on them -- they can still be friends, bt to start a family, that's a totally different issue altogether.</div>

Instead she is coming into a rather poor one from her own poor background. However, she does not work, cannot do housework and throws her kid to whoever's around. But she spends as if she is the richest women in the world. When the money dried up, she filed divorce and when we wanted to keep her child, she wanted to get the child she abandon with us back with her so that we have to pay her more money and sell the HDB that my family paid for and stays in.  Its not just our country that such things happen and such shallow people exists. It exists in every country.<br><br>Agree with the post above. With just $1000 (Effective take home is $800 minus CPF), the guy would have not be able to support enough his own parents much less a wife, kids and house, with current inflation and cost of living. But I am not saying the less well off guys cannot have parents, wife, kids and house but everyone has to chip in and work hard.<br>How does one do that. How our parents survived the poorer days...  Eating salted vege and porridge (porridge is luxury, some people eat barley or unpolished rice) everyday, wash clothes by hand using fab soap, use popinjay soaps for showering, don't have a heater but bathe with kettle boiled water when cold and no internet, 14 inch TV shared with everyone, shared fan, 3-5 inch mattress (mattress is luxury, usually it is wooden plank or mats) shared by everyone, live in 1 room rented flat with cement floor, $20 groceries must last 1 week and walk to work. Pure basics, no entertainment but it can be done and don't ever get sick.<br><br>How many guys will be willing to live like this themselves and yet it seems that the guys expect so much from the girls and be like their mothers be sacrificing and giving but still must go out and work to bring home the bacon. Vice Versa. So isn't it time for some of the less advance guys and girls to upgrade their thinking?<br><br>Furthermore, most folks, regardless of earning power still like to enjoy some vices, such as gambling, smoking, drinking and etc, in the name of relaxation. With the current cost of living and all that vices and temptations, most guys cannot live on their own salary without help. So if the girl comes in and help out the family and is willing to suffer with him. This is what I hear most girls are willing to do (provided that the guy is not dead broke and she has to support him head to toe and a xiao pai lian). However, what I hear of the guys is that, the help from the girl is Expected and will be Taken for Granted and the girls cannot "make noise" or say that he need to work a little to help himself, and she must be a docile cow for his pleasure and he will do as it pleases him. It is this ungrateful feeling I get from the lot of immature whiners here that really, they deserve to get hitched with the shrews and get all the crap they deserve. But when that happens, these whiners will come and announce to the world, local women are lousy and whatever. But they are whiners... that's why these whiners are unable to get the better ladies among the shrews.<br><br></div>

I don't think the idea of xiao bai lian is very attractive nor is it popular to guys in general. What you are saying relates more to the typical girl mentality. It is the typical woman's idea to depend on the guy for income while she juz sits at home and be a tai tai. If the guy earns enough then all is good, but unfortunately this is not how it is for the majority, esp in SG. In this modern times, sg girls get the same education and same job opportunities as the guys, yet when it comes to choosing a partner, $$ comes in as very high or even top priority.

Remember the no. of divorce cases shot up during the low employment periods? How many women will be willing to slog together with her hubby in his times of poverty? Not many.<br><br>Your comment about men expecting their wives to help out, I think this is very understandable. In times of need, the guy is probably down and out, and being married and taken the vows, isn't it only right that the wife helps out for this period of time? If it is the wife who went out of job, don't you think she will expect the hubby to support the family? Or do you think it is only right for the hubby to file for divorce? Marriage means the two persons go through thick and thin TOGETHER, yet many girls will run off at the very thought of the guy being out of work. Very practical indeed. Some people can even comment to the guys to only come back to them when they have succeeded.

I only hope that this is not the attitude of the majority of the guys here. Also, wives/GFs (and vice versa) being encouraging instead of "rubbing the salt in" or "stepping on it" on the guys would be a better alternative isn't it?
