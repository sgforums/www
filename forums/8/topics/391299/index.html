              <p>Angel sweet angel you are so worng. The ladies' part i have no say but i can say not all girls come from the same mold so their concepts may also defer from one to another. As for guys. you should be grateful to have one ableto provide for the family as one of his capabilities. one who puts career first priority may think for a long time when have to make a choice. a career can means a lower pay job. while putting his mind on the job should be a better alternative. As long as he has a stable job and do not put it as the first priority you can be sure he will be a good family man.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>don't worry i don't take photos with girls. i only like taking photos of potraits and people. because i know comparing looks some guys are no better. so i doubt maybe its TLC they offer better, a better actor or you know got money to spend on girls.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so sweet angel the last time you wanted me to carry your bag and stand further away i did. i have your bag and very very personal belongings. you want it back?</p>

              <p>when a man had overly concentrate themselves in their career, extra martial affair can occur, this happen when a man had reach the height or nearly the height of his career and feel lonely thereby start to look for young gals like us to taste the fruit of their success, I mean after all these of years of toiling and hardwork, dun tell me they go back and see their old hen at home nagging at them again, sure they will look for something in their life to enjoy privately, and as a man, if you got power in company, money, career settled, what more do you want,...sex lor.</p>

              <p>when a man had overly concentrate themselves in their career, extra martial affair can occur, this happen when a man had reach the height or nearly the height of his career and feel lonely thereby start to look for young gals like us to taste the fruit of their success, I mean after all these of years of toiling and hardwork, dun tell me they go back and see their old hen at home nagging at them again, sure they will look for something in their life to enjoy privately, and as a man, if you got power in company, money, career settled, what more do you want,...sex lor.</p>
