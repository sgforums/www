Or will you settle down somewhere else?<br><br>Granted singapore is cited as one of the best places in the world to live, but even then there are certain drawbacks i'm sure you're aware of when compared to North America or Europe.

This is still my homeland, where I was born and raised, so I am still very much attached to it.<br><br>As for my retirement years, I feel that Singapore is not that ideal a place to be in. There isn't much old folks can do here, at least to my concept. I would rather own my ranch and live on it.

            <div class='col-md body'>Whoops, i just saw that i forgot to post my input after the question *grin*<br><br>I was thinking of breaking my bond at one time, as someone said canada (north america for that matter) has plenty of pull. But now i figure i'll be heading back to complete my NS (althought i think 2/half years is rather long), get a job in singapore for a while and then head off somewhere else to settle down.<br><br>Granted that the singapore government is doing a good job, but i would never want my offspring (if i have any) to grow up in a 'sheltered' environment with a naive mind set (i use that term loosely) . Anyone read about the hello kitty craze? Thats an example of the type of mentality that i would want to avoid. But i also admit i'm still young and would have a lot to learn in the coming years. Who knows i might change my mind at the later date?<br><br>On a more sensitive note, Singapore is home and home is the best place to be.<br><br>p.s I think i would also miss the food  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>bis,<br>I'm ok at making generic curries but can't get specific flavours, i.e. laksa or mee siam. I'm getting increasingly frustrated! The damn "Easy to Cook Southeast Asian Delight" recipe book my ex gave me is a f**king rip-off. I followed the recipe religiously and it still came out shitty!<br><br>cheers<br><br>[This message has been edited by Terence (edited 09 February 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I sit on the fence on this topic. I've been studying in the US for 4 years now, and it's time to decide what I should do next. There are pros and cons if one wanna stay in the US or balik kampong. it'll be definitely advantageous if I stay in the US to work, after all got a US degree. gain experience also good. Pne thing pisses me off though... bladdy working visa not easy to get.<br>Back home, must compete with the other S'poreans for jobs. In the US, alot of companies take you WAY BEFORE you graduate... or at least consider you. In S'pore, alot of companies dun even wanna look at your resume until you graduate. This thing piss me off about S'pore kiasu mentality.</div>
