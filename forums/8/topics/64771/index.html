            <div class='col-md body'>hmm, but that would be similar to insurance isn't it? not just MLM, but all kinds of work or business involving sales will probably cause certain relationships to turn sour because of the pushiness to clinch that deal.<br><br>it's like this one. on one hand, the person needs to keep his ricebowl, on the other hand, people feel coerced to buy whether they need or not, but the final say lies in them of course. if they are weak, don't dare to decline, they only have themselves to blame.<br><br>in any deal, it's a 2 way thing. you can sell, but I diedie also don't buy.
