            <div class='col-md body'>First of all, I think the jcgirls website is pretty lame. I mean some people just have nothing better to do. No offence man, but, I guess everyone should be free to do what they like, just not my idea of spending an afternoon clicking away.<br><br>Which brings me to the second point, why the media and the general public so worked up by this? And what's more shocking is that some people even talk about privacy and censorship in the Internet. I mean it is supposed to be free flow of information.<br><br>We all have a choice whether we want to visit a particular site. Just because some people find it offensive, so the ISP has to remove the site. Come on, you don't have to go there if you hate the site. Nobody is pointing a gun at the back of your head and say, go to <a href="http://www.sex.com" rel="nofollow">www.sex.com</a><br><br>Sure, it corrupts the mind of those innocents. But I think they are just taking the lazy way of solving a problem, instead of educating people what's right and wrong and then leting them choose, it's like telling someone this is right, there are 2 choices but u can't choose the wrong one, so I've taken the liberty to omit the wrong choice in case you choose the wrong one.<br><br>You don't want the children to go surf porn site, just install those netnanny softwares. Parents these days are just dumping the responsibilities to those above - the government or ISP in this case. I think it's the side effects of the government for planning so much for the people - medishield, edusave, etc. Good in the sense that the nation will prosper and live in harmony. Bad in the sense that people don't think and become lazy, taking things for granted.<br><br>About the entreprenuer thingy the authority is promoting, well, I think they might not be doing things right. First of all, society here don't tolerate failure, how many people would be kind to those who dropout of school? Maybe they are just misunderstood kids and due to discrimination and all, they do bad things. And then if you fail in your business, people around you will look down on you. Unless society changes, no way is it gonna work.<br><br>Secondly, the educational system is producing more machines than human. Good thing the authority realise it and is trying to change, but I think it's gonna be a difficult task and the change seems like lip service.<br><br>Hmm...I think I can go on and on, but I'll just stop and wait for replies. Don't wanna overload you guys with information. And I'm not cynical, just been thinking about things and seeing it in different lights.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To put things back in perspective, no society tolerates failures. How many dropouts around the world do you know of who are doing well? Those who do have got something special inside them, and even then people like them are few and far between.<br><br>It's not right to blame society for not being tolerant to failures that's hampering entrepreneurship in Singapore. Rather, Singaporeans are afraid of failure. Everybody wants the security of a 9-5 job, and only a handful are willing to take the risk.<br><br>Then again you can say that the education system doesn't exactly promote entrepreneurship, with students being overtaxed in skills like engineering, business, etc... and leaving them little or no time to pursue other interests. Stifling of creativity is another major issue, with the amount of time spent burying our heads in books trying to remember pages of redundant formulas. Isn't understanding the concepts behind the subjects more important than reproducing formulas? Just think that the education system needs to be reworked.<br><br>Cheerio!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First of all, I'm not blaming the society for that. It's just that I wish people who be more kind to each other.<br><br>To me, fear is just another double-edged sword. If you learn to control it, you'll do well. If you let it control you, then you're doomed. Fear of failure is not necessary bad, it pushes you to want to succeed. But if you are very afraid of failure and don't want to try, then you have already failed.<br><br>I agree that something need to be done to improve on the educational system here, though I'm not sure what exactly is to be done. Perhaps it's more than just the educational system, maybe it's also the way the society works.<br><br>Again, let me stress that I'm not blaming the government or the society for all these, I'm merely stating the problem.<br><br>I guess there's a price to pay for being an efficient society. There's no free lunch in this world. You win some, you lose some.</div>
