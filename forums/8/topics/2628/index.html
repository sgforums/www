What is the best way?<br>Girls and guys are equal now, its ok for a girl to do a guy's job but juz wanna ask, do u prefer u daughter to grow up playing with dolls or guns/transformers? What abt ur son?<br><br>Miss purr, i agree with ur method of the child obeying u when she/he is young and setting him/her free when he/she is old. Finally we agree on something. Ke Xi Ke He <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>Then comes the hard part.... How old should the child be to set him/her free? Should we juz use age alone or do we have to settle it case by case?<br><br>Yah what will u teach ur children too?<br>Juz some thoughts.....<br><br>Mind</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What is most important, is to let the child decide what is his or her path to take. It depends on how much you could educate him or her when they are growing up to teenagers.<br><br>The hardest age to teach the kid when the kid reaches teenager stage, where the kid is exposed to many influences coming from the environment, where it becomes impossible to shelter. Well, it depends what kind of way you want. I will prefer to use love rather than fear to teach the kid. Afterall, it is better to be loved than to be feared.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is going to be interesting. I was discussing about losing virginity when I'm still untainted, and now I'm going to try to talk about raising children while not even being married.<br><br>For me, its going to be a case by case basis. Part of me says that I will protect (i.e. make decisions) my child when its required, let him/her do the thinking or even make small mistakes when I think he/she will learn from it. But I do know that real life is not that clear cut.<br><br>First of all I wouldn't be able to keep track of what the child does or learn all the time. I'll try, but its not easy. Second of all there is no clear gauge to see if I did a cockup job of allowing my descendents to make their own decisions, and then change my hold accordingly.<br><br>So, personally, I'll accept the fact that I'll worry about my kids, and try to remember to pull back when neccessary. I'll also spend time with them so they are comfortable talking to me so that they know I'm there if they need me, but not just for money of course. I'll also share the responsibility with my wonderful, beautiful, responsible and understanding wife so I can blame someone else when something goes wrong. I'll try to understand that shit happens, and whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger. I'll also have to teach them that life is tough, people are bastards, and everything else is bullshit.<br><br>I'm suppose I'm saying that I'll need to change my style as I go along, keeping to certain principles and adopting new things as I learn them. Its impossible to plan or say at this stage. I think I'll concentrate on looking for someone to make babies with at the moment.<br><br></div>
