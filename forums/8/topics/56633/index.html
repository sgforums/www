            <div class='col-md body'>The feminist movement has done its job: the gender wage gap has gone the way of June Cleaver's apron and bosses chasing their secretaries around the desk.<br><br>Women in the 2000's are now earning as much as -- or more than -- their male counterparts.<br><br>Great. This is exactly the way it should be in our society.<br><br><strong>what equal?</strong><br><br>But equal rights come with a price because true equality means equality across the board, not just equality until the check comes. The real gender gap is that women with good jobs and equal incomes are still insisting that men finance their social lives.<br><br>I'd say that's a double standardÂ… a very self-serving double standard.<br><br>Why should men foot the bill for dinner, entertainment and weekend getaways, while women happily bank their paychecks? In an age of equality, shouldn't the focus of dating be on partnership and sharing, instead of women still expecting to be taken care of financially?<br><br>Let's look at some of the excuses women use to justify forcing their "equals" to pick up the check:<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">1- Men earn more than women for the same job.</span></strong><br><br>False. Such skewed statistics as "women earn about 75 cents for every dollar a man earns" represent outdated, selected data still promoted by radical feminists who insist on portraying women as angelic victims of a "man's world."<br><br>According to the U.S. Department of Education, the U.S. Bureau of the Census, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (among others), the wage gap simply does not exist for women with bachelor's degrees, even in such "male-dominated" fields as architecture and engineering.<br><br>And many similarly-educated women aged 35 to 44 actually earn more than their male counterparts.<br><br>Moreover, studies by these same organizations show that men consistently work longer hours than women at the same job, so, in essence, women are earning a higher hourly wage.<br><br>Where a wage gap does exist can easily be accounted for by: job experience (according to The Journal of Labor Economics, full-time employed women have 20% less job experience than men); larger numbers of men in their 50s and 60s who are earning bigger salaries based on time and experience; female job choices (women often seek out jobs with less income potential such as teaching or retail, or are less dangerous than certain higher-paid male-dominated occupations, such as firefighting and construction); longer male hours at work (men work 90% of overtime hours); the large percentage of female part-time workers which distort the statistics; and the time women take off from work for child-rearing (an option not normally afforded to men).<br><br>Even if it were true that women earn 25% less than men, women still should be picking up 75% of their half of the dating expenses. Equal rights means equal rights.<br><br>This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to their excusesÂ…<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">2- If a man's a gentleman, he'll pay for me.</span></strong><br><br>Acting as a woman's version of a "gentleman" is an excellent example of how men are brainwashed by women to fulfill their self-serving interests.<br><br>Mothers train their sons to buy into this scam at an early age, teaching them to treat women like goddesses and to pay for female company without question.<br><br>No man should allow himself to become a doormat for female whims, and no man should have to pay for a woman earning as much as he is.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">3- It costs more to be a woman.</span></strong><br><br>Women package themselves for sale to the highest bidder they can attract -- you don't see umpteen magazines touting beauty tips or gigantic cosmetic counters for men. No one -- and I mean no one, needs a hundred pairs of shoes.<br><br>And as for what it costs to be a man -- try getting a date without an expensive house, an upscale car and nice clothing.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">4- It's just nice.</span></strong><br><br>Sure it's nice -- I'd like someone to give me door-to-door chauffeur service, bring me presents, and pay for my dinner and entertainment, all for the possibility of sex, but with no obligation whatsoever. Let's be honest; if we did this, we'd be in jail for fraud.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">5- It's just expected.</span></strong><br><br>Yes, it is expectedÂ… by women who have set up the rules of dating and sex by forcing men to bend to their rules. And this means, if you don't pay, you don't get laid.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">6- If you don't pay for me, you're cheap.</span></strong><br><br>I love this one -- pure sexual blackmail. It just proves that what women really want is cash.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">7- Whoever asks for the date should pay.</span></strong><br><br>This is a great example of the female double standard. How many women have actually asked you out? And yet you can hear this excuse from women on a daily basis!<br><br>Let's look at it this way -- when two women go out to dinner, does the one who asks pay? No, they usually split the bill. The same thing happens when a woman goes out with a man who's just a "friend" -- each pays an equal share.<br><br>But the second that sex enters the equation, the woman expects to be paid for. This is nothing less than whitewashed prostitution.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">8- I can get away with it.</span></strong><br><br>This is when the truth finally comes out. I've heard many women say, "I've got what you want and you're going to have to pay for it." Such arrogance just reduces dating to a whore/john relationship.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">9- My girlfriend's boyfriend pays for her, so why shouldn't you?</span></strong><br><br>This is another version of the "you're cheap" routine. What's she's really saying is, "my girlfriend gets away with sexual blackmail, and I want to get away with it, too."<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">10- I offer to pay, but guys say no.</span></strong><br><br>In these days of equal rights some women will make a thinly-veiled, half-hearted attempt -- once -- to uphold their end of the "equality" bargain by offering to pay their half of the check.<br><br>But it's all a sham -- she knows that the guy knows that if he takes her up on her offer, any hope of sex is over.<br><br><strong>bottom line</strong><br><br>As men, the best thing we can do is to put our collective feet down and stop paying for women. After all, their behavior amounts to little more than extortion and sexual blackmail.<br><br>The reason women can still get away with this behavior is because we let them. It's time to stand up for ourselves and demand equal rights as men.<br><br>There should be absolutely no question about who should pay the bill: we both should.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think a good way will be that the woman and the man pays on different dates. Let's say the woman pays for the lunch and the man pays for the dinner. On special occasions like birthdays the opposite sex can offer to pay for everything. This creates an atmosphere of giving selflessly and receiving abundantly too. There is no gain nor loss incurred. Something like a compromise.</div>
