            <div class='col-md body'>I understand that the death of Jesus was the reason for the new convenant to God for Christians but I cannot accept that they failed to actually portray the mental suffering of Jesus when he was lured by Satan. I mean, that part was featured for less than 10 minutes when it was heavily covered in the Bible itself.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Being a Non-christian, I had the opportunity to understand that Jesus actually learnt from that experience and it was his passion that prevented him from going astray then. I liked the portion where he suffered physical abuses and his determination when he was judged, tortured, forsakened.<br><br>As a whole, Mel Gibson did a very fine job on focusing on the Bible itself, but did not actually bring out important and fine details as was written in the Bible.<br><br>I would had given it a 10 out of 10 if they featured 30 mins on Satan's role. Well I think it deserved a 8.5 out of 10 for the story, action. It was indeed worth the time spent.</div>
