That implies that the government must do all it can to make the move to the island a positive one.  You and I don't know the best way or ways to do it.  That's their job.  All we can both say is whether it's right or wrong based on the little that we know.  Those people who are hit by the disease are already isolated from their loved ones.  Family and friends visits can be arranged but the government is the one with the brains and money to arrange 'the best way'.<br><br>By the way, iif it was so wrong, why did we send the TB cases to St. John's Island to recover?

I'm not sure how to read your tone, but I'll assume the negative side for this since you capitalised the word 'EQUIPPING'.  The first para of my last posting states proper planning and implementation.  That means equipping the entire island with all it needs to heal those patients as well as protecting the patients.<br><br>And according to my second paragraph, patients should be encouraged.  That means the government will take into account what a patient needs if he or she has to go.  The government isn't just going to individual beds and say, 'okay, John, your turn, mate', right?<br><br>And if I may add something, put yourself in the government's shoes.  You've been elected by a majority of the population.  Your task is to see to the welfare, well being and safety of the majority of the nation.  Basic leadership and politics here.  As the government, I'll have to do my utmost and everything in my power to convince and persuade the victims that we're not sending them there to die.  We're sending them there to get better and to minimise more casualties in the mainland should they stay there.  If you were in the government, mate, trust me when I say this.  You'll be more concerned about the ones who are living than the ones who are infected.  Unfortunate but true.  That is the price of being a leader.<br><br>MC Square:<br><br>They already did it, dude.  When the first patient recovered and was about to be discharged, they extracted some of her blood to create a serum and injected it into still-infected patients, or just one of them.  The news even reported an improvement on her condition.  But later, there was no news, thus my concern and query.<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>
