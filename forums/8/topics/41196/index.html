I don't think we'll be sending them to the island to die.  That's not logical at all no matter how you look at it, nor is it humane.  But isolating them on an island could increase their chances of recovery as well as decreasing the chances of spreading the virus in the mainland.<br><br>Suspected victims shoud be encouraged to reveal themselves by assuring them that we're not sending them there to die, but to recovery.

That implies that the government must do all it can to make the move to the island a positive one.  You and I don't know the best way or ways to do it.  That's their job.  All we can both say is whether it's right or wrong based on the little that we know.  Those people who are hit by the disease are already isolated from their loved ones.  Family and friends visits can be arranged but the government is the one with the brains and money to arrange 'the best way'.<br><br>By the way, iif it was so wrong, why did we send the TB cases to St. John's Island to recover?  Or are we going to dig up for controversial evidence that we sent them there to die?<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>

He also mentioned isolation at St. John's Island as one of the options if something like an entirre HDB block were to be infected.  I don't think he would have recommended that place just out of the air.<br><br>Speaking about vaccine...  I wonder how's the case of the patient being injected by a serum extracted from blood of recovered patients.<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>
