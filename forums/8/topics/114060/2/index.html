This is exactly what I meant when I previously wrote than when meting out punishment, it should NEVER be done in rage. Punishment should always done in a calm manner. It is pointless to rant and rage and relentlessly hit out at a defenseless child.<br><br>Caning is done in my house with the charges read out clearly FIRST, ie, the child need to know why he is caned, that chances had been given and ignored. Also the child is also made to understand what consequences would take place if such mischieve is left uncorrected. Method of punishment is then spelled out - one stroke on the palm, two stroke on the palm or a removal of privileges etc.<br>There is always a limit, either in terms of number of strokes, or in cases of privileges, a time frame. Once I banned my younger son from xbox for three weeks. His brother can play it anytime he wants but he can only watch.<br><br>I learned NOT to develop rage when punishing the kids because of my mother. The only punishment she knew was to cane, and she'd developed anger in that process.<br><br>While I respect and love my parents, I am aware that not everything they do is right. As a responsible adult, one must adapt and improve the good and throw out the bad when emulating one's elders. Caning was good for me, being angry when caning was bad for me as it does not serve to do anything but to channel all that negative energy to me.<br><br>I was once in a taxi where the driver and I were talking about child upbringing. He said that he always bring his son to the beach when the child messes up. There, he would bash the child up as he is angry. I asked him what was accomplished by that action. I question why he needed to get angry and why channel the anger to the child. He suddenly realised that he was wrong in that. Hopefully the next time the child messes up and is punished, the punishment is something more constructive.<br><br>And no, my sons are not rebellious. But like every child, they are curious. As a parent, it is my responsibility to equip them to cope with life, so <strong>no questions are left unanswered</strong>. I educated them on sex education even way before the schools do them. They are aware of all the f words that come across in the latest hip hop songs. They know that such words are not to be used. They are also taught to respect others. Each of us have our personal space, and there should not be any violation of such space. To give you an example, permission is seeked when opening personal drawers. Even I need to ask them that I need to open their drawers.<br><br>Allow me to repeat my stand: punishment is necessary, caning is only ONE of the means. It has to be controlled and purposeful. It has to be explained. Once the child knows you mean business and play ball and become responsible, caning is not longer necessary. The child, now can be seen as an equal where negotiations can take place. If the child can earn my respect because he is seen and proven to be responsible, we can all throw away our canes.<br><br>My boys, while will forever be my offspring, are also my equal in many decisions in my home. It is only when there is something critical, that my father hat comes on.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">The trick, really is, when the adult is angry, is he mature enough to handle himself?</span></strong></div>

I question why he needed to get angry and why channel the anger to the child. He suddenly realised that he was wrong in that. Hopefully the next time the child messes up and is punished, the punishment is something more constructive.<br><br>And no, my sons are not rebellious. But like every child, they are curious. As a parent, it is my responsibility to equip them to cope with life, so [b]no questions are left unanswered</strong>. I educated them on sex education even way before the schools do them. They are aware of all the f words that come across in the latest hip hop songs. They know that such words are not to be used. They are also taught to respect others. Each of us have our personal space, and there should not be any violation of such space. To give you an example, permission is seeked when opening personal drawers. Even I need to ask them that I need to open their drawers.<br><br>Allow me to repeat my stand: punishment is necessary, caning is only ONE of the means. It has to be controlled and purposeful. It has to be explained. Once the child knows you mean business and play ball and become responsible, caning is not longer necessary. The child, now can be seen as an equal where negotiations can take place. If the child can earn my respect because he is seen and proven to be responsible, we can all throw away our canes.<br><br>My boys, while will forever be my offspring, are also my equal in many decisions in my home. It is only when there is something critical, that my father hat comes on.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">The trick, really is, when the adult is angry, is he mature enough to handle himself?</span></strong>[/b]</blockquote>ahhh...That was enlightening. I suppose thats one way of looking at disciplining the child. This method is very different from what I think. I agree with you on educating the child early on cause and effect, But I still believe that the cane shouldnt be used at all to teach the child the consequences of wrongdoing.  Parents are still humans. And not every human is perfect or can control their temper easily. As such, the moment the cane is in their hands, anything can happen(I admire your ability to control your temper<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">). I suppose reasoning works best when it is practiced when the child is young. Question, reason and speak with the child when they are still young. let punishment be in the form of a verbal dialogue between the child and the parent.</div>

Unfortunately there was a person sitting on that side of the floor, she got hit by the falling wood. I made my son apologised to that person first, but I also stated that it was not a place for her to rest (the place was condoned off for some reason). A security guard appeared immediately and admitted that the barricades were structurally unsound. Still that did not exonerate my son from blame as he should not have touched those barricades.<br><br>Another incident involved a neighbour and when discovered that my son was in the wrong, I marched him to my neighbour's place, and made him apologise to her.<br><br><strong>The issue is: we cannot shield our children all the time. They will have to learn to face the consequences of their actions. Or else how can they learn.</strong><br><br>In another shopping mall another time, I saw a group of young children (around 8 yrs old) throwing little pebbles that they'd picked up from the flower pots down to the lower level. I gave chase and stupid as they were, they ran back to their moms. I proceeded to inform the mothers of their children's action and I was glad to see the mothers immediately gave these kids a dressing down.</div>

He/She has no one to turn to but his parents for guidance. As such this is a crictical stage in a childs growth. The behaviour and attitude of the child in future will be largely dependant on the parent's behaviour towards the child. If my toddler were to do that, I would calmly tell him in a somewhat serious tone that such actions are not to be done. No spanking necessary.</span><br><br>When a child repeatly commits the same mistake in spite of being spoken to, is he stupid, stubborn, or that the adult is a poor communicator or maybe the message is wrong?<br><br><span style="color: blue;">[color=green]1)My stand here would be "take out the log in your eye before you comment about the log in other people's eye". In this case, I would fault myself for being a poor communicator. Obviously my message was not clear. it could be that the manner which I conveyed my message was wrong. So in this case, I am clearly in the wrong. Dun forget that the child is innocent and would listen. This assuming I have been bringing up the child through non violent means when he/she was a toddler.</span>[/color]<br><br>Can we start equipping our children from young to learn responsibilities, even though some of these learning processes can be painful?<br><br><span style="color: blue;">2)That is possible through verbal dialogue. Of course you can also encourage the child to try it out the practical way like reminding him that stealing is a no no because it harms others. Whether this process  </span><br><br>If communication-only always work, why are there so many brats out in the streets whose parents are firm believers of the "non-violence" way?<br><br><span style="color: blue;">3)Really? So far I have opnly encountered a few brats, and they happen to be ang moh. The parent whom I spoke to before posting this thread was a firm supporter of "Love not violence". And her children were in front of me. I saw how civilised they were. The parent explained to me that Love is the most important thing in child upbringing. She emphasised alot on giving the child freedom to explore the world. Let them explore freely, and watch them closely. If they fall help them up. If they did something wrong, reason with them. If they have something to tell you, listen. no spanking or caning is needed to enforce your reason.
