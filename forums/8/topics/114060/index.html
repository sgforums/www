            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm...I just had a discussion with a parent on the difference between asian and western child upbringing. It seems that in western upbringing, Love is always emphasised in the child's life. Whereas in Asian upbringing, never listen or disobedience=caning on the butt or hands. The western way of upbringing always emphasise on reasoning rather than violence(is caning considered violence?) My parent friend says that caning has a huge psychological impact on the child. He says that caning makes the child more rebellious and unwilling to listen. But what about the sentence "spare the rod spoil the child"???? Which do you think is better? Reasoning or caning?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dr. Arun Gandhi, grandson of Mahatma Gandhi and founder of the M.K. Gandhi Institute for Non-violence, in his June 9 lecture at the University of Puerto Rico, shared the following story as an example of "non-violence in parenting":<br><br>"I was 16 years old and living with my parents at the institute my grandfather had founded 18 miles outside of Durban, South Africa, in the middle of the sugar plantations. We were deep in the country and had no neighbours, so my two sisters and I would always look forward to going to town to visit friends or go to the movies.<br><br>One day, my father asked me to drive him to town for an all-day conference, and I jumped at the chance. Since I was going to town, my mother gave me a list of groceries she needed and, since I had all day in town, my father ask me to take care of several pending chores, such as getting the car serviced. When I dropped my father off that morning, he said, 'I will meet you here at 5:00 pm, and we will go home together.'<br><br>After hurriedly completing my chores, I went straight to the nearest movie theatre. I got so engrossed in a John Wayne double-feature that I forgot the time. It was 5:30 before I remembered. By the time I ran to the garage and got the car and hurried to where my father was waiting for me, it was almost 6:00.<br><br>He anxiously asked me, 'Why were you late?' I was so ashamed of telling him I was watching a John Wayne western movie that I said, 'The car wasn't ready, so I had to wait,' not realizing that he had already called the garage. When he caught me in the lie, he said: 'There's something wrong in the way I brought you up that didn't give you the confidence to tell me the truth. In order to figure out where I went wrong with you, I'm going to walk home 18 miles and think about it.'<br><br>So, dressed in his suit and dress shoes, he began to walk home in the dark on mostly unpaved, unlit roads. I couldn't leave him, so for five-and-a-half hours I drove behind him, watching my father go through this agony for a stupid lie that I uttered.<br><br>I decided then and there that I was never going to lie again. I often think about that episode and wonder, if he had punished me the way we punish our children, whether I would have learned a lesson at all. I don't think so. I would have suffered the punishment and gone on doing the same thing. But this single non-violent action was so powerful that it is still as if it happened yesterday. That is the power of non-violence. "</div>

The teacher can't teach or the student stupid?<br><br>When a child is wrong, whose fault is it? Are the parent's too lenient or is the child too rebellious?<br><br>As adults, we should take the responsibility. As minors, they do not know right or wrong. It is our responsibility to be a good role model for the children. Sparing the rod and simply ignoring the responsibility of educating the child is not the best way. Caning without thinking of a better alternative is also not the best strategy. Proper education with patience and leading by example is the best way  to convince anybody, even adults.<br><br>My friend has a 8 yr old daughter. One day they went shopping n the daughter insisted on buying a pair of jeans which costs $100. She told her daughter not to buy here but the daughter kicked up a big fuss. So not wanting to create a scene, she gave in. The next day, she brought her daughter to another shop n showed her the same jeans selling at $30. She then explained to her daughter why yesterday she refused to buy but becos of not wanting to create a scene n not to deny her daughter of what she wants, she bought it. The daughter understood what her mum's intention n felt guilty n apologised to her mum on the spot.<br><br>I believe this will develop a trust in the child to the parents' decisions.<br><br>Of course parents cane out of love for the child becos they care but this way of expressing love thru violence can be avoided if we practice a little more patience within ourselves. After all, we're adults n children r prone to immaturity. If we cannot control ourselves, how do we expect our children to behave themsleves?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>To me, to truly love a child is not to give in but to teach the child understanding, respect, moral values and such things. To instill in the child a sense that the child is loved and yet will be taught and even punished for wrong doings. My love for a child extends to the fact that once the child is taught, the child will be able to grow up and think carefully weighing out actions and choices in one's life and choose among all the distraction, noise, conflict and mass media with guiding principles and values system that is innate to the child. That the child will be able to live independently and fulfill his life in the manner that best suits him.<br><br>Love is not withholding the cane. Its not love to withhold the cane.  To love is to use methods suitable to teach (even with canes) and teach in the loving manner.  To never abuse or be violent and respect the child and his feelings as well. To explain and practice patience.<br><br>I've seen my niece being brought up by a overstifling "loveless" environment where my brother never ever corrects his kid. And even screams that my parents 'torture" the girl when they stopped her from trashing the place. I see a brat being brought up to be just like him who is a brat and a real bastard. I am utterly sad for my parents where they have 3 kids and I always wonder what had gone wrong for my brother because he's the one who my parents gave the most to. Yet his is the one who hurts them the most with his sh|tty attitude, comments to throw them out and a long list of things he had done but blamed on everyone and everything.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Allow me to give the perspective as a father of two sons.<br><br>I believe in caning. I believe in punishment..... before someone scream child abuse, let me explain.<br><br>In the course of a child's development ie, from infancy, to toddler, to young school-going and teenager, one can correctly assume that in each stage, a child's understanding and perception of issues continue to grow. It is also a built-in mechanism of each child to test and try the boundaries. Like it or not, boundaries exist, be it a strictly regimented regime or a by-and-large freedom of choice.<br><br>Take a toddler for instance, this child has no concept of right or wrong, only what interests him. It can be pushing the buttons of daddy's hifi system or sticking his little fingers into the VCR slot.

I believe in punishment..... before someone scream child abuse, let me explain.<br><br>In the course of a child's development ie, from infancy, to toddler, to young school-going and teenager, one can correctly assume that in each stage, a child's understanding and perception of issues continue to grow. It is also a built-in mechanism of each child to test and try the boundaries. Like it or not, boundaries exist, be it a strictly regimented regime or a by-and-large freedom of choice.<br><br>Take a toddler for instance, this child has no concept of right or wrong, only what interests him. It can be pushing the buttons of daddy's hifi system or sticking his little fingers into the VCR slot. In itself, such acts are NOT morally wrong, but they can be dangerous and also socially unacceptable (eg, kids pressing all the buttons in an elevator). The child has to learn (perhaps the hard way) that it is an unacceptable behaviour.

They have to have a certain level of responsibility in educating their children's behaviour.<br><br>Just simply not caning wif a bo chup attitude will only cause the child to be bo chup too. And caning just to vent anger or without proper explanation is of the worst sort.<br><br>Definitely a very thin n fine line to handle this issue. Without the proper motivations, it becomes very detrimental to the child. But when done with love and proper guidance like bro Chin Eng, the child learns to be responsible too.<br><br>Most often pro active parents who spend quality time with their child instills confidence n responsibility in the child. The parents become their role models. Next time we see children misbehaving, look at the parents n more often than not, we see a mirror image.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One critical realisation is what the parents see themselves as.<br><br>We can be a tyrant, a playtime partner, a financial provider, etc. I see myself as a mentor. My mentor process is to enable my children to grow to be responsible for their own lifes and actions, to inspire them to strive for excellence, to motivate them to achieve more.<br><br>The process is not easy as there are too many dynamics: spouses, grandparents, peers, school authorities, environment etc.<br><br>Each of these carry a level of influence that also continues to mold and modify the child's responses. When left on their own, many of these factors can over take the parent's influences. Once this has taken place, there is very little a parent can do. Of course, some turn out alright, but many will fall on the way side, totally messing up their own lifes.<br><br>Some things I tell my sons:<br>1. You parents are not always right. Feel free to disagree and discuss, but do it respectfully.<br>2. Do not pass up a chance to do things right, even though no one is looking and no one knows.<br>3. Your environment is you own, be responsible to it.<br>4. Put back whatever you have taken out. Assume that no one else will do it for you.<br>5. What you want to be in future, begins now.

The parents cane the child. The child grows up and becomes a parent and also start to cane the child. I dont think caning can be beneficial at all. Im now personally in favor of reasoning with the child rather than caning. Ive seen how my parents cane my brother b4 and how my brother starts bursting out loud and cr when he retreats into the room. And when he is in the room, what does he do? he secretly mumbles to himself on how he hates his parents <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> he isnt even a single bit remorseful because of what the cane has done. It hurts his so much that he probably lost the ability to reason it out with himself. Caning also creates an atmosphere of unfriendliness in the house. Most of the time, the objective of making the child listen is not achieved. Like in my case, I was repeatedly cane for hiding homework in the house when I was in Primary school. What was my objective of my actions? To play computer game. But my parents cane me first b4 reasoning with me and it became a vicious cycle. I hated homework becos it cause me caning+ no games. I saw no benefits in doing homework because of this. My parents wanted me to listen to them that homework was to my benefit, but instead the reverse was achieved with the cane instead <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  Thus I believe that reasoning to the child in a mature way will make the child listen. there was once my parents reason assiduously with my brother on why stealing was wrong. he never stole again. But he still continues to hide his homework till today <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>All said and done, there is no PERFECT approach. It all depends on the dynamics of the situation. There is the offence, the perpetrator and lastly the executioner.<br><br>Some of the punishments that I had meted out does not involve the cane at all. I have never caned my sons for having unsatisfactory results in spite of hard work put in. There should be the focus of the objective of the punishment. In the above situation, good effort was put in but due to some other reasons, the desire result was not achieved. I'd focused on how to get the child to perform better.<br><br>If in the case of being punished for hiding the homework for the purpose of playing computer games, then the emphasis for me is to communicate to the child is his accountability to his school and his teacher. I would not even enter into a situation to bargain for game time after homework is done. I may even remove the chance for the child to play computer game (even permanently) whether there is homework or not. The concept of cause and effect has to be taught to a child at a very young age.<br><br>My two sons are alone at home in the afternoon and they know that their top priority is to finish off their homework. No gaming is allowed. TV can only be turned off after all work is done. They are so focused on their work that I am behind schedule marking their assessment sheets. They are not even in secondary school yet. They realise that for whatever mischieve that they can be up to, it will come back to bite at them. For every homework missed, it will eventually be discovered by their teachers and it will come back to me. When that happens I will definitely come at them like a ton of bricks. They do not wish for that to happen.<br><br>Caning is ONE of the methods for teaching the child. It is not the best, and neither is it to be used all the time. Mere talking or reasoning with the child is also ONE of the methods, it is also not the best and in some case it does not work at all.</div>
