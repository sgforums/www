              yeah ok but i guess have to see though. not all kids are over-protected, not all kids are spoiled though. i guess some mature faster than the others but in this case, as the topic stated, i do not think the kids is over-protected if the parents do not allow their kids to go overseas with their alone though. could be due to other reasons though.

              <p>No i wasn't.. I lived in Singapore all my life and i've seen
              enough.. I look at my younger cousins today and you can tell, they
              and most of their friends are spoilt.. "Oooo !! PS3, Mommy can i
              get one. Sure, mommy will buy it for u.."</p>
              <p>And when did i ever compared us to 'them' ? I'm just talking
              about the general singaporeans. And you know i'm right ! Most

              <p>i cannot say most for sure but asking a parent to buy toys for them is just part of being a kid.....if the kid performs well as the parent expects him to i dun see any wrong in rewarding them......</p>
              <p>the difference between rewarding and spoiling is that those who spoil their kids are rich and those who reward their kids can come from the two categories........</p>
              <p>if we are talking general wise......it is only natural that parent would want to "spoil" them which parent in the world would ever want to not provide with their family wot they want? i believe this natural sense always coincides with the sense of wot they need rather than only wot they want.......this in turn gives the parent ideas on setting boundaries</p>
              <p>i have to admit that i asked alot from my when i was young although i didn't get everything that i wanted and stuffs i didn't wanted......as i grow up i tend to realise by myself the hardships that my parents went to to provide food although their jobds we're not really that hard but its the thought of wanting to provide for their kids</p>
              <p>its ok rlsh07.......we're just expressing our views......no hard feelings there.......</p>
