            <div class='col-md body'>Relationships in IRC is impossible....<br><br>We can use IRC to get to know more ppl, more friends and maybe a potential gf/bf.<br><br>But in order to have a real relationship or friendship, I think it is essential to meet up... Some people might agree with this... "Your personality and character on the net is  different from what you are in reality." On the net, we can be anyone we want to be. No one really knows us.<br><br>People who IRC including myself will know that lots of ppl are calling gals dear, darling, honey or laopor, etc... But I think I can safely say that 70% are fake. They are wat we termed as cyber gf.<br><br>In short, Humans require physical contact. Only in the physical sense of the world that relationships can survive.... Even if you have a gf and dun meet up with her often but very often in IRC...I can say that 100% you will lose her....<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well irc, just like the forum here, is just another medium to know more friends...of course we can build all sorts of relationship, like love, friendship, brother/sister hood....but we should not restrict ourselves on these medium alone..if face to face conversations won't guarantee a relationship, what do u think irc can....<br>most important of all is sincerity.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I disagree.<br><br>Recently, i got to chat up wif one of the irc pals which i did not chat wif 4 quite a while. then juz one day, she asked if i could call her, and i did( because when i promise ppl i keep my promise) and when i chatted wif her, i found that she has a very nice personality, and including that, she is open minder abt most things, and she has a cute voice. I noe that this is impossible, but i really fell for her character, she even shares her secrets wif me.......and we became very close to each other.......<br><br>but sad thing is i haf not met her yet, cause of her exams, i dun wanna disturb her......<br><br>so as u can c, relationships can happen, but it depends on individual....<br><br>------------------<br>Darkness is the only solitude I have at the moment.

            <div class='col-md body'>agree wif gigalo, you can make friends with people on irc, but NEVER NEVER EVER fall in love with them, because when you meet them face to face, you might be dissapointed with them, or they with you... but it's not impossible to start a relationship, after you meet them. who knows what will happen..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> enjoy yourselves people..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>and there she was.. standing there by the<br>corner of the brick wall, a place i'll never forget.<br>And there our eyes met.

            <div class='col-md body'>Relationship is kinda fated. You can meet your love one in any situation in life and IRC is just another situation that it might arise. One can know friends thru IRC but it is not wise to use it as a courting tool. What you perceive virtually is very different in real life. The person mood and attitude is something you will never be able to guess. He/She might be the cheerful, caring sort online, but what you are seeing are actually just words. Dun you rememeber there is such a phase "Action Speaks Louder Than Words". So what if the person tell you how much they love you.. all those are just words and you dun even know if the person actually meant what they say. What is a relationship if it is maintained via such means.. does that mean that people do not have to meet and go out and do things together?? Wouldn't life be sad?<br><br>My advice would be dun use IRC as a courting tools.. trust me.. I been there, done it.. and regretted it.</div>
