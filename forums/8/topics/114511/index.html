            <div class='col-md body'>My parents actually kenah before.  While moving off from a traffic light just outside Holiday Plaza, their tyre suddenly burst.  They stopped at the roadside and while my father was changing the tyres, my mother went into Holiday Plaza to change money.  She just took her purse along, leaving the handbag on the passenger seat (she thought it was safe since my father was there).<br><br>Soon, this guy on a motorbike came long and offered my father help to change the tyres, to which my father refused, not wanting to risk facing any scams.  However, while they were talking, another guy came from the passenger's side, took my mother's handbag and ran, hopped onto a motorbike and rode away.<br><br>My father couldn't do anything because he couldn't just dump the car on the roadside.  Besides, its never a good idea not knowing what you're chasing, especially in a foreign land.  How can anyone run after a motorbike anyway?<br><br>I personally know people who have gotten into trouble there.....windows smashed while cars are parked, robberies, extortion, etc.....even just being scolded or challenged to fights just for the sport of it.  Yes, I've gotten my fair share of traffic fines too.<br><br>I've been lucky though.  I'm a very frequent traveller to JB and KL and have never really gotten into any serious trouble, except for a case a few years ago, I was going through Malaysian immigration going into JB.  I was alone and the immigration counter was on the left side of the car.  So I stepped out of the car, closed the door and walked across to the left for immigration procedures.  The door locked by itself and the engine was still running.  hahahahaha.  You should've seen how pissed off the long line of drivers behind me was - they all had to somehow change to other lines.  As for me, I had to take a cab back to my house to get the spare car key.  Took 3 hours before I went back to claim my car.  The immigration officers were very cool and polite.<br><br></div>
