            <div class='col-md body'>Ok i am a foreigner by birth and a PR. I travel quite often and stayed abroad for a few years too. Many local guys complain to me that local women are materialistic and have high expectations ect. My male colleagues also say that. By by far what is the problem u all are are facing?<br><br>The educated women out there u have to think because as u know women have a limited lifespan in a male's world. u can only look as good by age 35 and once u hit 30, men may not be attracted as much to u as to a younger girl if they know your age. As guys now are getting increasingly sophisticated Am not realli trying to bash women on this but i think local guys are ok to me. Sure there are some who may be awkward or childish in their thinking but they are men afterall, they may change after settling down, I have known a few good examples . A man can still be desired after age 40 and can still father a child. My own father is a good example. He looks like someone in his 30s although he may be over 50 now. Yah he gets glances by women my age in their 20s ect.<br><br>And the guys should stop complaining on how women are materialictic ect. Maybe they will not find u as bad as they perceive u to be.<br>In other countries i have seen couples who became high school sweethearts married and setttled down later. But seldom can we see such a trend here?This could be the best time to find a partner dont  u think? ...during school days.<br><br>So u guys and gals here hook up and be happy. Life is short. Enjoy it rather than complaining about it.</div>
