              <p>The year started on the down side...at least for me...lost a friend due to mishandling of certain issues <br><br>I got to know a fellow forumer afew months back through a mutual friend.The friendship started off with casual chats and soon realised we could clique in terms of common topics and a whole string of amazing coincidences.<br>He was recovering from a rather bad patch of relationship that ended only about 4mths back.I told myself not to judge him for what had happened and opened up to be a friend &amp; at the same time get to know him better...<br>After knowing him we have been communicating via msn,smses &amp; occasional phonecalls almost everyday &amp; before I realised mixed signals started to come in through our daily conversations. He started asking me out numerous times,suggesting meeting up even before my biztrips,updating his whereabouts,nitty gritty things happening in his daily life whether I am in SG or on biz trips,sending constant thoughtful smses ( eg: Hows your day?, Did you rest well?, Have u eaten?,Hows work? &amp; so on...just to name afew...) When I fell ill,his concerns would come numerous times daily which in no way a platonic male friend relatively new would do.He also mentioned to a friend that he feels potential in me.<br>It escalated from time to time with concern in actions and ultimately showing up all of a sudden at the hospital when 1 of my family member is gravely ill. Accompanying the whole string of signals &amp; actions, I was deeply touched.I questioned his intentions of doing so as it had caused abit of speculations among family members who have met him. He told me that he just wanted to see how I was coping and commented if my family members were helping him *score points* and if I was attracted or felt anything ... amidst many ambiguous hints that came before this...in covers of being *shy* etc...On Xmas day he even offered to meetup &amp; wanted to lend me a book of encouragement to tide through the difficult time while he was with his family in church...<br>His actions &amp; responses were obvious enough for people around me to start asking &amp; quickly assume what was going on.<br>I had wanted to find an opportunity to speak to him about it but was at the same time bogged with workload &amp; shuttling to &amp; fro the hospital to take care of the sick patient everyday.<br><br>Afew days ago I found out from him after I asked about what his achieved xmas wish was...that he is seeing someone else, alot of emotions was gushing within me when I 1st heard it and after cooling off to prevent further damage I decided to have 1 last conversation with him to clear things off before I cut off all contacts and move on as I know continue being friends is likely to lead to a vicious cycle.It was a decision best to the situation but not by choice <br><br>He denied &amp; tried to justify all his actions &amp; signals by claiming that he has all along been cheeky,just wanted to show concern as a platonic friend etc etc which was all expected even before I spoke to him.<br>No one who goes around fishing whether intentionally or not would admit to doing so.<br>I questioned why he mentioned that there was potential when we were just platonic friends? He did not further explained but merely apologized. I took it as it is giving him the benefit of doubt that he could have missed out the question.wanting to end things amiably so I left things as it was...till I was told this morning that he had a conversation with 1 of my very close pal yesterday nite...&amp; also read the log awhile ago. He admitted having messed up the friendship but repetitively evade the * potential issue * when probbed by my close pal. If he can justify for his actions so quickly by putting it off as being mere cheeky, y didnt he dare to see a statement he made in the eye? <br>To my disappointment...I can only conclude that he was just seeking options among his pool of potential girls as rebound? viod-filling? or whatever reasons he may have, I unwittedly crossed his path and ended feeling hurt &amp; upset...<br><br>I offered a sincere friendship from the start &amp; sad it had to end like that.I take it as a lesson learnt... &amp; wish him all the best in whatever he does or achieve to do in future... <br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>To make things worse after I posted this experience on another women's forum yesterday,a string of other girls who were once victim or had friends who are victim came to msg me asking if it was this particular forum user when his name/nick was not even mentioned yet.Girls or even Guys please beware of this player in sheep's clothing as he is very active in popular forums everywhere!</strong> </p>
