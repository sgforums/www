My money what!  </div></blockquote>I think it just how they phrase their sentense in a way not pleasant to others lo. They just don't have the skill to do so. Maybe you are more well-educated than them or they are simply bad at this communication ethic lo. It's just their character or hobby you are hating, I guess. Maybe they just don't know about it. Actually if you dun feel like answering just say a few words or just smile back to them to hint them lo. Soon they will be sian liao. I think they are just being "concern" about you ba.</div>

My ovaries are dead, due to stress from people pushing me to get pregnant.  Gynae say one".</div></blockquote>Nowadays ah, why people get annoyed so easily one. Just shoot back "I don't know" can liao lo and if can give them a big wide smile lo. Soon they will have no topics to go further one lo. Why have to kick a fuss at those questions mah.</div>

They should ask their parents, bro or sis or close friends lo. Maybe they are not too close to thier relatives lo. I agree, people don't like to be asked personal questions.</div>
