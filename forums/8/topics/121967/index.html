            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports is setting aside a 1.2 hectare plot of prime land in Orchard Road for youths.<br><strong><br>While most youths cheered the move, some older citizens thought it might be a waste of space. </strong><br><br>The proposed youth community space will be located behind Orchard Cineleisure.<br><br>A stretch of Somerset Road will be closed and the current carpark will also be shut in July to accommodate the new youth space.<br><br>In the past, some youngsters had never consider taking part in political forums.<br><br>But with the youth consultation process that has been ongoing since last year, they say they have changed their minds.<br><br>17-year-old Edward Chia said: "I'm happy that there are no longer any boundaries for us youths and I'll love to voice out."<br><br>17-year-old Bryan John said: "There are more avenues like political websites and forums, etc. Personally, I feel that it's happening very slowly and I would like to take part in the future."<br><br>And along with other youths, they want a say on how the piece of land set aside for young Singaporeans off Orchard Road can be used.<br><br>14-year-old Byron Kaz said: "It's kind of good to have a place we can call our own. We can have a multi-storey sports place, like ice skating place."<br><br>19-year-old Hamant Singh said: "I'm excited because the government is moving in the direction I hope it'll move. It would be nice to see more playing spaces, somewhere for people to play music without licensing, going through all the paper work."<br><br>While many young people applaud the move to seek out their views, they also say that coordination and careful planning together with the Ministry is crucial.<br><br>After all, deciding on what to do with a piece of land worth millions of dollars is a big responsibility.<br><br>"The ministry should take the overall work. For youths, they tend to make mistakes. Certain things, you can entrust to the youths, certain things, you leave it to the ministry to help," said a teenager.<br><strong><br>"If a lot of people have a lot of ideas and a lot of youngsters are going to give all their ideas, it will be too messy, so collaboration should be needed," </strong>said another.<br><br>Older Singaporeans however, had mixed feelings.<br><br>"In Singapore, land is so scarce, land is most costly, it's better for the government to consider it before giving it to the youth," said one.<br><br>"They are our leaders of tomorrow, the youth. So, we should give them more space to express themselves," said another. - CNA<br><br>[/quote]<br><br>what do our youths here think? is it going to be a waste of space? another white elephant?<br><br>and what do you think should be in that youth space? another speakers' corner, but this time solely for youths? stage and setup for anyone to perform to an audience? extreme sports setup? or simply an open space where youths can do ANYTHING?</div>
