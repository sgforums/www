The character of billionaire industrialist Charles Bishop Weyland was written for actor Lance Henriksen, a veteran of "Aliens" and "Alien3." "Alien" film fans will recognize the characterÂ’s middle and last names: "Weyland" derives from the Weyland-Yutani Corporation, the multi-national conglomerate that sent the Nostromo on its ill-fated voyage to retrieve the Alien in the first film; and "Bishop" is the name of the android played by Henriksen in the second and third Alien installments. Says Anderson: "Weyland made his money in high tech industries and he is the father of modern robotics, so when the Bishop android is created 150 years later [in the timeframe of "Aliens"], itÂ’s in the image of his maker."</blockquote>this AVP movie is never a branch off of both Alien n Predator movies..<br>it was all along related thru AVP comics n finally in Predator 2..<br>in Predator 2 a scene show a quick shot of an Alien skull(a trophy) in the Predator spaceship...<br>so its sort of like a prequel of both Alien n Predator movie..<br><br>n abt those stuff that dont make sense in the movie..its a Science Fiction movie..its was never meant to make sense.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>but if u are both Alien n Predator fans..it will make sense no matter wat.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>to sum it all up...the show sux..it was lousy directing all the way..the show is toooo short..lousy story..something like a low budget C Grade movie..<br>this is not the AVP movie i want n ive waited nearly a decade for it..this is the crap that the fans got..<br><br>Fark U Paul Anderson!!! _l_ u have ruin everything!!!<br><br>more info<br><br>the creature Alien was design by H.R Giger n use in the Alien film..<br>wat inspire Giger to design Alien..it happen when he was in the bathroom bathing n masturbating at the same time..he saw the shape of his dick n began to draw n finally the birth of Alien(im not joking)..<br><br>Alien are able to take the characteristic of its parent(or victim)...if the Face Hugger infest a bull..u will get a bull alien..if u get a shark..u will get a shark alien.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>but the most powerful mixture will be a fully humanoid alien(was cast in Alien: Resurrection)the normal Alien are only part humanoid..<br>if u see carefully on the last scene of AVP where the chestburster came out of the dead Predator...the chest burster has the feature of the predator...<br>a Predator Alien????<br><br></div>
