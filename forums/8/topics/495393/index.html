              <p>I have been wondering why someone would actually becoming a guarantor for someone who wants to borrow money from the loansharks. If you were once a guarantor, please enlighten me...</p>
              <p>1) What is the benefit that you could possibly get from becoming a guarantor? If none then why would you become one?</p>
              <p>2) As a guarantor, do you ask for any form of collateral from the borrowers as compensation for the high risks you are taking?</p>
              <p>3) After the loan is taken out, how do you make sure borrowers don't run away? Do you ask them to report you regularly to make sure they are repaying the money they borrowed? </p>
              <p>Please share your experiences with me.</p>
              <p>Every story is very much appreciated :) </p>

              It is unwise to be a guarantor due to the following reasons:
              
              1. You don't get to use the money
              
              2. You are 100% liable for the debt you have never used
              
              3. In the event the main debtors default you are liable for the full sum
              
              4. Legal action and bankruptcy may be filed against you. 
              
              Most of the time the guarantors end up having to pay for the debt that the original debtor incurred.  Ultimately,  it is foolish to be a guarantor for anyone even the next of kin!

              <p style='font-family: "Source Sans Pro", sans-serif; '>A guarantor is a person who guarantees to pay for someone else's debt if he or she should <a style="cursor: pointer; color: #005b9d;" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp">default</a> on a loan obligation. A guarantor acts as a <a style="cursor: pointer; color: #005b9d;" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/co_sign.asp">co-signer</a> of sorts, in that they <a style="cursor: pointer; color: #005b9d;" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pledgedasset.asp">pledge their own assets</a> or services if a situation arises in which the original debtor cannot perform their obligations.</p>
              <p style='font-family: "Source Sans Pro", sans-serif; '>A guarantor is also someone that certifies to the true likeness of an individual applying for a product or service.</p>
              <p style='font-family: "Source Sans Pro", sans-serif; '>Also known as a Surety.</p>

              <p style='font-family: "Source Sans Pro", sans-serif; '>A guarantor could be the same person applying for the loan. In this case, s/he acts as a guarantor by guaranteeing the loan with security in the form of any asset that s/he owns. However, in most situations, a third party guarantor is what is requested depending on the financial circumstances of the borrower.</p>
              <p style='font-family: "Source Sans Pro", sans-serif; '><span style=" background-color: initial; font-size: 16px;">A guarantor is usually required when a person is needed to either confirm that a borrower can pay his debts in the event that a loan is approved for him or her or needed to verify the identity of another person.</span></p>
              <p style='font-family: "Source Sans Pro", sans-serif; '>Usually, people or businesses with poor or limited <a style="cursor: pointer; color: #005b9d;" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-history.asp">credit history</a> can only get a loan if they have a guarantor. For example, an individual with a comparatively low <a style="cursor: pointer; color: #005b9d;" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit_score.asp">credit score</a> looking to obtain a <a style="cursor: pointer; color: #005b9d;" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lineofcredit.asp">line of credit</a> to cover unforeseen expenses may be required by the bank to find a guarantor before the bank will issue them the line of credit. Car loans, <a style="cursor: pointer; color: #005b9d;" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp">mortgages</a>, <a style="cursor: pointer; color: #005b9d;" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commercial-loan.asp">business loans</a>, <a style="cursor: pointer; color: #005b9d;" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/student-debt.asp">student loans</a>, etc. are all examples of loans where a guarantor may be required to assume credit liability in the <a style="cursor: pointer; color: #005b9d;" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/event-of-default.asp">event of default</a>.</p>
              <p style='font-family: "Source Sans Pro", sans-serif; '>The guarantor guarantees the loan by putting up his assets as <a style="cursor: pointer; color: #005b9d;" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collateral.asp">collateral</a>. If the borrower makes his payments in a timely manner and never defaults, the guarantor would not have to take any action or owe any money to the <a style="cursor: pointer; color: #005b9d;" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lender.asp">lender</a>. However, if the borrower cannot make good on his loan payments, the guarantor takes on the responsibility. In addition to making the scheduled payments, the guarantor may also be required to cover any costs or interests that were incurred from the borrower’s late payments. If the guarantor cannot cover the debt, the <a style="cursor: pointer; color: #005b9d;" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pledgedasset.asp">assets that s/he pledged</a> as security for the loan will be sold to cover the remaining debt.</p>
              <p style='font-family: "Source Sans Pro", sans-serif; '>A guarantor can be limited or unlimited in his financial responsibilities under the loan agreement. A limited guarantor is one who is limited to time or amount. The guarantor may be asked to guarantee a loan only up to a certain time at which point the borrower will be fully responsible for payments and defaults. A limited guarantor may also only secure a portion of the principal amount of the loan including interests and fees, as opposed to an unlimited guarantor who is liable for all amounts due and owing to the lender.</p>
              <p style='font-family: "Source Sans Pro", sans-serif; '>Guarantors are not only requested when the borrower has poor credit history. <a style="cursor: pointer; color: #005b9d;" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/mortgages-real-estate/08/buy-rental-property.asp">First time property renters</a> are usually asked to provide a lease guarantor by the landlords or property managers. Students are more likely to fall into this category with their parents or close relatives acting as guarantors on the rental or <a style="cursor: pointer; color: #005b9d;" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lease.asp">lease agreement</a>. The lease guarantor guarantees that in the event that the tenant is unable to continue paying his rent or breaks his lease agreement, the guarantor will assume the responsibility for the payments until the lease is over or given to someone else in a <a style="cursor: pointer; color: #005b9d;" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sublease.asp">sub-lease contract</a>.</p>
              <p style='font-family: "Source Sans Pro", sans-serif; '>In the event of default, the guarantor’s credit history may be negatively affected which could limit their chances of getting loans or any type of credit form a lending institution in the future. It is therefore, imperative that the guarantor understands what he is signing on and the responsibilities that he may be required to take on.</p>
              <p style='font-family: "Source Sans Pro", sans-serif; '>A guarantor differs from a co-signer. A co-signer is co-owner of the asset and has his or her name on the ownership document. The guarantor has no claim to the asset purchased by the borrower under the loan agreement, and only guarantees payment of the loan. The lender will normally ask for a co-signer if the borrower’s qualifying income is not up to par with the lender's requirement. The co-signer’s additional income would help bridge the income gap. Under the guarantor agreement, the borrower may have sufficient income but limited or poor credit history.</p>
              <p style='font-family: "Source Sans Pro", sans-serif; '>A guarantor is not only used in a financial context. When a person is applying for a service such as a job or a passport, a guarantor may be requested. In this case, the guarantor certifies that they know the applicant and that the applicant is really who they say they are by confirming photo IDs and signing documents.</p>
