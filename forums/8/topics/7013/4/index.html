Hmm maybe ManUtD did played better than RealMAdrid, but to me , the best bits came in bits and parts , which was definitely not enough against Real, especially so in the Champion's League. Opponents would make them pay.<br><br>To me, "Great Soccer" is about attacking and defending well. Hmm maybe ManUTd was great going upfront, but they definitely were not strong covering behind. That was why i insisted they did not played well. Hmm of course, i had seen them played better. Examples were the 3-3 draw against Barca in the nou camp, the 3-1 victory against Fiorentina. Have you seen them brush aside Inter and Juventus last year on the road to their treble truimph? Or perhaps you are just too excited about your "ass lick" liaoz??HAHAHH pardon me, i just cant bear making a cheap joke at a cheapo.Oppz pardon the pun too!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Your definition of "great soccer" and mine totally differs but that does not render you a good reason to insult me "dumbass".These are two totally different schools of thoughts.

Hmm maybe ManUtD did played better than RealMAdrid, but to me , the best bits came in bits and parts , which was definitely not enough against Real, especially so in the Champion's League. Opponents would make them pay. To me, "Great Soccer" is about attacking and defending well. Hmm maybe ManUTd was great going upfront, but they definitely were not strong covering behind. That was why i insisted they did not played well.</div></blockquote>If you watched properly, they were more or less dominating from the 20th to halftime, except for brilliant saves from Cassilas and defence of Karanka managed to save Real Madrid. After half time, Man United conceded those two Raul goals very stupidly due to disastrous marking of Silvestre. After those two goals, Man United started dominating again, and it was due to the heroics of Cassilas again which saved them.<br>So I don't know how you can say that just because due to Silvestre's lousy marking, you can blame the whole team and say they played badly? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> Especially since they had most of the possession.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by phunkY:</div><div class="quote_body">Or perhaps you are just too excited about your "ass lick" liaoz??HAHAHH pardon me, i just cant bear making a cheap joke at a cheapo.Oppz pardon the pun too!!    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div></blockquote>Hah Hah.<br>Excuse me while I replace my rib<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by phunkY:</div><div class="quote_body">Your definition of "great soccer" and mine totally differs but that does not render you a good reason to insult me "dumbass".These are two totally different schools of thoughts.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hehe cool.HS,guess what.Glad you bother to read all the shit that i wrote.Thanz bro~<br><br>Hmm anyway back to the topic.Geez i really don't know what you all want huh.Firstly,  you all were the ones who jeered at ManUTd when they got kicked out of the CL, making crude remarks and provocative comments. Retailiation arrived and verbal assaults ensued.Now it seems that im more like anti-ManuTd than all those jokers who started the threads laughing at us.Nah, definitely not. I dont wanna be like them~~<br><br>People were crying how ManUtd deserved to lose to a better team , which i think Real was, cos` plainly they defended MUCH BETTER than ManUtd. Defense was the basis of my argument with Sunny. No teams deserved to win if they didn't know how to defend as one against onslaughts.THAT was my point.<br><br>Of course i did notice ManuTD was enjoying the lion's share of possession.They were attacking like never before also.Err didn't i mentioned that?? However no one goes into a match and gives away three crap goals and hope that they can come back and snatch it all back.HMMMmm unless we are talking about the scousers lah, because ManUtd did managed to come back three goals down to draw at Anfield.It was in the 80s then. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> That's another point. They were bad at the back and if the defense continued to play as amateur they demonstrated, ANY team can win them, including ur dearest Pool.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>To conclude, defense and attack are both vital to a team's performance.Admittedly and unfortunately for all the ManUtd fans out there, maybe we should say Real is a better team because they know how to defend better.<br><br>Fans are also a team's harshest critic.We bask in their glory and criticise as and if we deem it right.Support is about acknowledging our shortcomings too. We are no blockheads who see mistakes and take them in our stride, unlike some "true fans " out there who love the team as bad as they are. You cant blame us for being harsh or ambitious.After all , im conversing with you on my beloved Manutd , not some loser teams who are more than glad to win some Coca-cola Cup.Yah blame them for lacking ambition and not up there challenging MAnutd for the title instead of the 2nd place.Pathetic.<br><br>Errr one more thing, the insults between me and Sunny is fringing on the personal side and i will appreciate if you will just shut up and enjoy.Cheerios~....<br><br>------------------<br>mAke luRvE`~ not wAR..</div>
