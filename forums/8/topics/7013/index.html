Sunny, you obviously have forgotten. He would just lurve to score against the SCOUSERS n make them go out to manUTD in the FA cup in injury time. He is no miracle worker.<br>Anyway , all the MAnuTD fans out there, i know MAnuTd played a bad game n they DESERVED to lose.LOSt we did, but hey din we beat the shit out of LIVERFOOL n the rest of the PRETENDERS as well?I dunch think other teams can fare much better than what MANUTD had achieved. Im a FAN but im oso can be the harshest critic of our team.I sure lurve to see how the rest of the english teams fare next yr in the european leagues.

Sooths your ego? It makes me laugh when people argue about "their" team when er..it's not "theirs" . So what if you support a good team? Are you good? Or only your ego is good? BTW I don't support any team. Maybe go support S-league lah(but too boring hahaah). Stop dissing other teams like you own the team like that, and let's appreciate GOOD football.</div>

Im a FAN but im oso can be the harshest critic of our team.I sure lurve to see how the rest of the english teams fare next yr in the european leagues. Hopefully, they can be THAT BETTER.~~<br><br></div></blockquote>Why the hell you want to talk about beating Liverpool(Scousers), Duh.<br><br>Did you even watch the match?!?!<br>What do you mean Man United played a bad game?!?!? Dumbass, they played an absolute blinder and it was only Silvestre's poor marking that cost those goals but of course you didn't notice.... The Real keeper also saved so many from Man United, how could you say Man United played badly?<br><br>Typical Man U fan, just liek their assed manager, can't admit that they were outplayed by a better team that day,.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>guys guys, if u ppl r really soccer fans, then shouldnt u be looking at the match itself and give credit to the team that has won???<br><br>i dun know abt u ppl, but when my team loses(which happened pretty often in the earlier part of the season), i didnt bother to defend them, cos they deserve it... in fact i'll be proud of them if they played well, even if they lose...<br><br></div>
