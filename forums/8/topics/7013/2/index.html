            <div class='col-md body'>hahahaha..<br>u of all ppl.. is at last getting it right...(aft all)  :p<br><br>juz afew quotes to add to the "debate"(was there any fight??)<br><br>Why the surprise when they are given a footballing lesson by a top draw team? Lazio did it to them in the Superwhatsit Cup and Vasco in the Club World Championship. True, they have had their moments of genuine class (beating Fiorentina at Old Trafford, beating Arsenal at Highbury) but they defended against Real as if they were playing West Ham or Boro. All credit to Real. No way were they lucky on the night - they were lucky when the quarter-final draw was made....<br><br>....Bayern would probably have beaten them, if not Barcelona would have destroyed them....<br><br>....Their defence was pathetic to let the Spaniards make three goals at home in England. I personally think the 0-0 draw in Spain hurt Man U, especially when they probably thought they had it in the bag, a figure of speech. They thought it was won. Then an idiot like Giggs shoots his mouth off. They deserved to lose after those actions....<br><br>.......As a United fan, I think this season can only be looked at as a disappointment. The decision to drop out of the FA Cup was a terrible mistake....<br><br>It's Time For A Clear Out!<br>A few players were shown up to what they are last night - not good enough. Manchester United need to spend wisely in the summer. Beckham behaved like a spoilt brat last night AGAIN...<br>Silvestre, the two Nevilles and Berg need to go. Am I the only person who thinks Gary Neville has no pace, no passing ability and has not a notion on how to time a tackle?<br>As for up front, Andy Cole has to go. United need to spend big and bring in a top class striker, Cole does OK in the Premiership but, when it comes to the big Euro matches, he goes AWOL. Either spend big or move Cole over for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Also United need a goalkeeper..(DUH? MIGHT AS WELL CHANGE THE WHOLE TEAM...)<br><br>HERES SOMETHING FOR THE TEAM FR MERSEYSIDE..<br>An Open Letter To Manchester United Fans...<br>I would like to send an open message to you on behalf of the fans of Liverpool Football Club. The last decade has seen you on top of the British game, yet when Liverpool had a decade of dominance (the 1970s firstly), we ran Europe.<br><br>This is why you are not as good as the greatest Liverpool sides, because you can still get totally outplayed at home by Real Madrid. You have done well and had some fun, but a word of advice: savour this league title, enjoy it, because it's your last for quite a while.<br><br>Don't feel bad, you've tried everything to rule Europe completely (diving, cheating, harassment, assault... and some good footy), but you are just not there are you? It's not your fault. Never mind, Liverpool have decided they will have the title back next season, and take care of business on your behalf.<br><br>By the way, thanks for taking care of the Italians recently, but leave the Spanish for us - the real English force will take them for you.<br><br>Once again, thanks for the entertainment (Keane's O.G., Beckham's beard, Taibi, Silvestre and many more chuckles) and I look forward to looking down upon you next year.<br>Steve Davies, Merseyside<br><br>laugh at others.. as others might laugh at u mistakes..<br>take it like a man.. or b laugh at by the mans..<br><br>fr a "quiet" surporter of E "Mapies" &amp; a souce of income for bookies..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

Some are, I admit...but it's so obvious from this and another thread that all the arrogant nonsense come from opposition fans. It's so obvious from the tone that those anti-Man U fans are going all out to deride and humiliate Man U after every loss. Now that's what I call provocation and if a Man U fan doesn't retaliate, he really shouldn't consider himself a fan anymore. I support Man U, but I dun go around critising or putting down other teams, and I feel that nobody should do that. Sometimes I really wonder. Are all those supposedly Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea etc fans really fans?? Or are they just anti-Man U??<br><br>As for the match, I think that the better team won. No doubt about it. Real took their chances and they deserve to advance. I salute them. This is an all too familiar feeling...Man U going out at the quarter/semi stage.

Terrific player and striker. love his work rate and sportsmanship.<br>other than that, didn't really find the others' any fantastic. and yes, Stam USED to be a good defender...came to Man U and soak in their behaviour and attitude.

What i CAN'T stand is that u guys kept on harping on ur SUCCESS! It does gets on the nerves sometimes. Didn't see me grinning and shouting "Arsenal Is the Greatest" when they won the Double few years back. That, my dear Man U fan, is humility. but i doubt u guys can appreciate the word, cos u need to brag to feel good.<br><br>they can't stand their team got beaten by man utd, they can't being thier onlt a football team and man utd is an enterprise.....<br><br>Does it makes a diff??? At least i know my money on my Arsenal jersey is well spent on Thierry Henry and the likes. Ur's most likely ended up in ur board of director's whoring expenses...in South America. opps, sorry, getting personal here. The point is, does it matter to US wether UR club is an enterprise or pure footballing club?!?!?! NOT!!<br><br>do u know why they laugh at man utd when real madrid beat us??? cos they know their team can't beat us, the only way to laugh at us is to use other team!!!! is just like using pple butt as the skin of ur face, ha wake up lah, catch us if u can, or u can invite real madrid to play in the EPL!!!!<br><br>tsk tsk, amatuerish (like some Man U players) explanation for this wave of negative behaviour. Laugh at u?!?1 We laughed at u BECOS u guys fall so FLAT on ur face, thinking that conquering Europe is so easy. If u had no respect for the team u r playing against, don't expect us to show u respect when u lose and still groan loudly that ur team is UNLUCKY. How delusional can some chaps get??? For ur info, my supporting team can best ur's anytime anywhere. So don't keep using this issue that we can't win u so we choose to support other teams. WE support the BETTER teams anytime dudes. Real Madrid to play in the EPL??? Well, this competition is for the BEST clubs in Europe to face one another and ur team FAILED to impress and progress. So STOP ur LOSER attitudes by challenging them to ur home ground and playing in ur league. tsk tsk, how childish can some fans get?!?!?!!?<br><br>there is sometime i laughed a lot, did u ppl see the players comment on man utd in the Big Match...they want man utd to be regelated!!! ha, don't they have a sense that if man utd would be to down, the liverpool, arsenal must go down earlier....remember, they are worst than us....<br><br>they are not worst than Man U. Man for man, they can match u guys anytime. but then again, this is not some Cup finals or what, but the long and tiring EPL. Some teams just can't hack it...including mine, sad to say.<br><br>and that stupid Wenger said in the soccernet that man utd had it easy this season, they went brazil for a rest...but i thought arsenal got a lot of rest too, cos they got knock out of the FA cup early!!!!<br><br>sigh, if Man U is serious in S.Amex, they wouldn't have lost and be humiliated by the Latin clubs there.<br><br>lastly to all anti man utd fans, u can hate man utd forever, but u just cannot deny they're the best in England....results speak more than everything...</div></blockquote>yes yes we know, all proud and arrogant fools. Just becos u won the EPL doesn't mean u r the all supreme football club in UK..or Europe for that matter. That last concluding sentence is enough to make us fans of other clubs see RED and can't u blame us for "hating" u guys and ur clubs?!?!<br>grow up u Man U guys...if not, u will never gain the respect of us guys...and the whole world.<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>
