            <div class='col-md body'>Guess wat? Liverpool will most likely be in the Champions League next season, unless there is some miracles. So, before you guys start proclaiming whose team is better, why not wait till next year as both of us will be in Europe playing in the same comppetition. Hopefully the Red Devils will win, of course!!!!!!!!!<br><br>------------------<br>Devilac<br><br>________________<br>MAn Utd 4ever!!<br>----------------</div>
