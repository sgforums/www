I agree with u.It all boils down to the fact that success breeds jealousy.Of course, Im not harping on the point that all of you are green-eyed.That will create more ruckoos.Heheh.I don't mind your insults.But it seems to me that its more of a provocative , baseless statement. It is like going up to one and pointing the middle finger at him.Right, Sunny?  Retaliation is expected.No one goes around starting threads like "yo , MAnuTD sUX n their FANS are cLOWNs" and expect us to keep our goddamn mouths shut.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>One thing , Sunny, you know why i keep bringing in SCOUSERS? I hate their guts the same way you hate "MAnure" or whatever you call us. But i don't go up to you and stick my middle finger up ur nose n laugh at you whenever Pool got a bad result which is more often than not nowadays. Your insults are just plain biased and provocative, you are just seeking to aggitate us.Keep your partisan views unless you are seeking a verbal assault from the irate us. However, it seems to me that its all intentional and you cant take it when i purposely bring in the fOOLs and laugh at them the way u jeered at us. Yeah, what a character you are , Sunny. Hmmmm I should stop here before someone complains of malice in my comment.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>------------------<br>mAke luRvE`~ not wAR..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am also a fan of English soccer and my favourite team is Spurs but sadly it been another poor season for them. I am more interested in my Spurs team performing well than seeing Man Utd lose.<br><br>I do not hate Man Utd but in fact I admire the team although I am no fan of the players.<br>A team that won 6 championships in 8 years deserves to be admired and respected. I do not know why so many people detest Man Utd. Could it be due to jealousy or are the fans of Man Utd too arrogant ? I am glad that my friends who supported Man Utd are not arrogant or else I might ended up hating Man Utd too.<br><br>But 4 now, I say congratulations to Man Utd for yet again winning the championship.

            <div class='col-md body'>once upon a time, we had the EPL and the Champions League thread where we had civilised discussions and debates on English soccer.<br><br>now, some joker started a flaming thread and look at the mess in this thread.<br><br>Horrible defensive errors and wasted chances caused a Man U loss. Nothing more to say about that. Man U sucks? hardly...find a team which can convincing outplay it in the Premiership. for all of Arsene Wenger's big talk, the real reason why Arsenal screwed up this season is because their defence is too old and they don't have enough cover at the back.<br><br>So, Man U isn't much better. yah...but things will change. the defence will be different next season. how different? we'll see...<br>Bossie sucks...hmm....Shay Given makes lots of errors too. any Newcastle fan or other club fan laughing at him?<br><br>Man U probably isn't the best team in Europe now as they can't shore up the defence, but they are up there.<br><br>Barca and Real have off-days too. Their silly defensive mistakes are as funny as the ones Man U conceded against Real.<br><br>to argue that Man U is the greatest is a moot pt as u can't prove it. even the best loses from time to time. what do u need to show that u're the best?<br><br>to argue that Man U sucks is a even greater joke. when Man U got hammered by Chelsea 5-0, pple said the same thing. in the Premiership, except against Arsenal and Liverpool, Man U, on a good day, can put at least 3 goals past ANY team. i wonder what the pple in this forum will be posting tommorrow morning.<br><br>if Chelsea loses and big, alex will be flaming the rest and i'll be amused to see how the rest replies.<br><br>if Man U loses (unlikely....Chelsea is NOT Real...but still..)the rest will have a field day flaming Man U.<br><br>if it's a draw...well...we'll find out the response tomolo morning<br><br></div>
