            <div class='col-md body'>Extract of some eyewitness accounts from BBC news:<br><br>We are very lucky to have survived. We left Patong for a boat trip at 07.30 to Phang Nga. Boat but the trip aborted early to avoid the tidal wave. The boat to Phi Phi we were on 2 days earlier was sunk. We were on Phi Phi 2 days earlier and now we believe many people have died there. We have been unable to return to Patong last night so we slept in emergency accommodation and heard many horror stories from evacuees whose family members are missing. There were stories of severed limbs from flying glass, narrow escapes from drowning and people literally outrunning the tidal wave from the beach to escape. The Thai people have been magnificent, providing free food and drink and accommodation very quickly for us. Today Patong town is a disaster zone. All businesses within 500 metres of the beach are destroyed, cars are smashed, power lines are down, many thousands of people will have no work for some time to come. Bodies are still being recovered. We saw vehicles taking bodies to the hospitals or mortuaries but the clean up operation will start soon. Right now, everyone is in fear of a second wave or aftershock, and rumours have led to panic at least 2 times today.<br>Malcolm Tetley and James Spooner, Patong Thailand<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Extract of some eyewitness accounts from BBC news:<br><br>I was washed away by the tidal wave but luckily I was not thrown back into the sea. I was carried into a kind of huge channel where the locals keep their boats. In a few seconds this otherwise peaceful channel were turned into a roaring inferno of boats washed ashore, plenty of fish already dead floating through this extremely dirty sewage water. I already considered myself a lost cause as I was whirled towards massive boats at high speed. Finally, I got hold of some sort of solid wooden board that was hanging down from a boat not yet washed out to sea. I called out for help and one Chinese man managed to climb down. I was still in a daze and hardly managed to utter the words thank you.<br>Felix Arabia, Penang, Malaysia</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Extract of some eyewitness accounts from BBC news:<br><br>I was sleeping in a tent near a beach in a national park on the east of Phuket airport when I started being shaken around by the sea (around 10am) I woke up as the tidal waves started to wash the tent away. I could not find the zip and had to tear the tent apart to get out. I struggled to rescue the tent and its contents but had to rapidly let go of the whole thing to save myself. As I escaped, the water became extremely muddy and the tidal wave and the forested area made the escape very difficult. Finally I managed to climb onto a tree to get some relief from the waves of mud and moving objects (cars, trees). After regaining some strength, I went to rescue a young boy that had been separated from his parents and was stuck in the branches of a fallen tree (his parents were very relieved to find us later on at a local dispensary - one of their friends had not been so lucky and had lost her two kids.) As I escaped the area, I could apprehend the vastness of the devastation.<br>Alain Diandet, Phuket, Thailand</div>

There were two houses on the beach and a restaurant, behind the beach was at least 25 bungalows they are also completely gone. I have many friends on this beach and we have already found one dead.

Just found out a short while ago that they're alive. They were lying on the beach when the tidal waves struck! They had to tie their kids to trees or they'd have been washed away in the waters. Hotels are flattened and all they have is the swimming costumes they were wearing at the time, everything else washed away.

It broke out the back windows and we were carried out. We scrambled on to walls and rooftops but within minutes the tide surged higher and 15 to 20 feet was not high enough. The buildings around me collapsed and I was thrown into the surge. When I came up there was a branch I grabbed on and held. Surviving the receding tides was hardest. Pinned against a tree by the water, debris and bodies started to pile up against me and it felt like I was being crushed. In the end, the whole resort was gone.
