I don't see why anyone should have to apologise for his/her ethnic group being more successful, economically or otherwise, than any other ethnic group. You make a statement like "Chinese chauvinism is rampant" but do not bother to substantiate your statement with any fact. What is the language medium of education in Singapore? What is the language of commerce in Singapore? What is the main language used on street signs? What is the primary language used on government forms and documents? Are the majority of radio and TV stations in Chinese? Have you been to a Malay or Indian home in Singapore? If they choose to practise their "traditional culture" in whatever form, do they suffer persecution or marginalisation of any sort?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>'but economic or ethnocentric, the result is still the same - ethnic marginalisation.'<br>'yes, but the voice of the conservative majority is appeased with the generic policies so far.'<br>'but who's voice is it, what is the ethnicity of is voice?'.we have to decide who's 'civil society' its gonna belong to.<br></strong></blockquote>Given that Singapore is a democracy (of sorts), isn't it logical that the voice of the conservative majority should be the loudest? Why don't you go live in Kelantan or Trengannu for a spell and enjoy the sweet liberty of living without ethnic marginalisation. I make no attempt to apologise for the way Singapore is run. I think most people here realise the limitations, given its geography and history. As in life, there will always be trade-offs, and I could give you a page full of situations where "ethnic" or "cultural marginalisation" occurs in many places throughout the world. But, like in Singapore's case, to take these illustrations in isolation and out of context is a pointless exercise in BULLSHIT. Singapore will evolve and improve - it has to, and the Govt has shown it is acutely aware of this need to evolve. However, non-constructive criticism, griping and coffee shop bitching (traditionally the strength of the Singapore populace) unfortunately will do little to affect or aid this evolution.<br><br>In the meantime, enjoy your tuna, whether served with mayonaise, cut chili, belachan or curry, but if it ever gets too hot for you here, there's always migration.<br><br>------------------<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Genius without education is like silver in the mine.</span><br><br>Benjamin Franklin</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>my fifty dollar per half hour worth<br><br>i think the focus on economics sits well with chinese mentality.  i don't know why, but it's just like the arabs are/were good merchants, i suppose it is part of their culture.  the malays on the other hand are not that driven to achieve what the chinese want to achieve (moneymoneymoney, perhaps  high education, too?)<br>i don't mean this as an insult, i think they just have different priorities and it's hard to be different with the way the country is run.<br><br>and as for the country speaking english, i'm sure if chinese or tagalog somehow become the lingua franca of the world at large, singapore's national language will change, too.  the usage of english is not because it's a foreign language to all, but because it helps singapore's economy.<br><br>however, i will not care to live in kelantan.  every place has its 'prosecuted' minority and if you can choose to be somewhere, why not in a place where your race flourish?  it's getting tiring to hear people say, if you don't like singapore, migrate, lor.  it's not the kind of answer fit to be part of a discussion among people who have ideas, yes?<br><br>------------------<br>Why be difficult when with a little more effort you can be impossible?</div>

MR. Testosterone made me do it! In any case, it is one of the options that sits at the back corner of my mind. As long as I choose to live in Singapore, I'll do my bit to try to make things work better for myself, family, friends, employers, community, and, yes, government. The day I feel it's not worth the hassle is the day I pack my bags and leave. "It's better to light a candle than to curse the darkness". No? I have no qualms at all about admitting that Singapore is flawed, but it always gets my hackles up when someone stands with an accusing finger and a "tsk, tsk, tsk..." while offering no constructive solutions or alternatives.<br><br>------------------<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Genius without education is like silver in the mine.</span><br><br>Benjamin Franklin</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, Terence,<br><br>It has been quite funny when I read the initial setup of your post. But I would deal with your arguments with these fundamental assumptions at hand :<br><br>1)Singapore has a population of 3 million, with the majority being Chinese, followed by Malay, then to the Indians and the other minority groups. I would label Singapore as multi-racial and multi-ethnic. Being a totally ignorant person on sociology terms, I would use multi-racial and multi-ethnic synonymously.<br><br>2)Since we have a fair share of different holidays, ranging from Chinese New Year (2 days), Hari Raya Puasa and Haji (2  days) and Deepavali (1 day), we can also label Singapore as multi-cultural in some sense based on holidays.<br><br>However, can we consider multi-cultural as just having holidays? Of course not, there are other things associated with that, like traditions and practices. For example, the chinese would celebrate Mid-Autumn festival with lanterns, even if there are no holidays. Of course, we have traditional Malay dances, and chinese dances taught in either associations or community centres. The collective makeup of a culture is dependent on how dominant such features are.<br><br>Singapore is moving towards a national identity while maintaining multiculturalism. It is trying to achieve the same balance as much as like in the issue of education, in curbing information and encouraging creativity, even though they are contradictory. It is an interesting question to ask now whether we do have a national identity in the midst of multi-culturalism.<br><br>The lucky thing is that Singapore, unlike many Asian nations do not practice racial discrimination. An example is the setting up for the Mendaki scholarships for Malays, which one could argue that it  is a political move. But if we just tread on looking on the welfare of the state, I think that the Singapore government is trying to ensure equality. There are isolated incidents like the case where LKY comment about Malay officers.<br><br>What I want to stress, is that economic prosperity  which Singapore possess is not based on just proper economic policies. It has been shown in studies, that third world countries practising racial discrimination do not flourish as much with the exception of Japan. I think that should not be taken for granted.<br><br>We used English as our medium to ensure that there is no bias, but we end up creating Singlish. So, is that an indication to less multiculturalism in Singapore? I beg not, as I think that the interaction and mixing of cultures has begun in our country in that respect.<br><br>To the others :<br><br>Terence might have strong views about people writing proper English, but that does not mean that you can personally attack him on his view. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but do not need to resort to insulting him.<br><br>Have a good day</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Proddy,<br>Thanks. With regards to your LKY comments, I hesitate to call LKYÂ’s comments isolated incidents when his position and importance are considered.<br><br>LittleMan,<br>Just a little anecdote for you. A SPH scholar friend returned last summer to ST for internship. During her briefing she was told by one of the editors to write reports/articles with the O level holder in mind.<br><br>Cal_guy,<br>*bemused smile*<br>Its interesting how the ultra right-winged always gets in a huff whenever criticised.<br>Of course you donÂ’t apologise. The dominant majority very seldom apologises for the political discourse in society since the raison dÂ’etre of such is always constructed around them. Also, the dominance of English as lingual discourse does not make a society more or less multi-cultural. It is merely the adoption of a business language. If French suddenly became the business language tomorrow, weÂ’ll obediently follow suit.<br><br>When I said SÂ’pore was not multi-cultural, I was alluding to the ethnicity of political and media discourse. The voice of which is predominantly Chinese. And when you bellowed that thereÂ’s nothing wrong in appeasing the conservative majority, well, who are the conservative majority and does that mean there is room for only one voice given the local multi-ethnic make up?<br><br>Also, could you explain why I was out of context when I brought up ethnic marginalisation? Sure, from Kosovo to Chechnya ethnic marginalisation has resulted in dire consequences, far worse than SÂ’pore has ever seen. But that doesnÂ’t mean we cannot examine or talk about it in a local context. To sweep it under the carpet the way you seem to propose to do only serves to lure us into complacency.<br><br>Substantiation of the allocated importance of Chinese culture in SÂ’pore:<br><br>1. By the late 70s, after sustained economic growth, national soul-searching and social reflection<br>infiltrated the popular mood. It was perceived that industrialisation had disrupted existing social relationships and weaken the economic function of the family (some patriarchal quarters whined that the increase in working women induced family instability). This perceived moral crisis at societal level also reflected an identity crisis at individual level. SÂ’pore responded by drawing on Â‘AsianÂ’ traditions to halt this moral Â‘decayÂ’ and perpetuation of Â‘WesternÂ’ morality. HOWEVER, these Â‘AsianÂ’ traditions were Chinese or Confucian in nature.<br><br>2. In 1982, 8 overseas Confucian scholars were invited to publicise Confucianism through public lectures, meetings with cabinet members and MPs. The two most prominent of them were Tu Wei-Ming (Harvard) and Yu Ying Shih (Princeton). Extensive coverage by Chinese newspapers (catering to conservative majority) aimed to develop a public discourse and indoctrination of ethnocentric values.<br><br>3. The pervasiveness of Chinese ethnicity has also been examined by local social scientists.<br>Â“There had been attempts to interpret the Confucian ethic as a universal moral code, as Asian or at least East Asian and hence relevant not only to the Chinese in SÂ’pore but the Malays and Indians as well.Â’<br>(Prof. Eddie Kuo, Â‘Confucianism as Political Discourse in SÂ’poreÂ’, 1996)<br><br>4.  Prof. Kuo also goes on to note,<br>Â“The characterisation also reflected a public perception that Confucianism was fundamentally Chinese. To promote Confucianism was therefore to promote Chinese cultureÂ…Now that the Confucian movement, together with the Speak Mandarin Campaign, were both being endorsed by the political leadership, the Chinese-educated population, including a small number if latent Chinese chauvinists, could safely jump on the bandwagon and promote Chinese culture by way of promoting Confucianism.Â”<br><br>5. The Â‘White Paper for Shared ValuesÂ’ in 1990 made very clear that the amassed values were compatible with all ethnic morality in SÂ’pore. However, in a section entitled Â‘Relations with ConfucianismÂ’ the White Paper praises the concept of government by Â‘honourable menÂ’ (junzi) as a Confucian ideal that fitted SÂ’pore society and needs. BUT this was a reversal of the EARLIER position held by several champions of the movement, including Goh Keng Swee, that Confucianism as political ideology be distinguished from Confucianism as ethical system. Clearly, there are mix signals on the role of Confucianism in SÂ’pore from the top Â– a struggle between political correctness and deep-seated views.<br><br>6. Evidence of Chinese chauvinism? Tang Liang How? Thank goodness he was hounded out of SÂ’pore.<br><br>7. Another interesting point. In the introduction of Â‘Religious KnowledgeÂ’ in secondary schools, Confucianism was the ONLY secular philosophy amidst major religions like Christianity, Islam, Buddhism and Hinduism. When did Confucianism suddenly become a religion?<br><br>IÂ’ve given you reasons as to why I think Chinese culture dominates the political and social discourse of SÂ’pore thus creating a potential breeding ground for Chinese chauvinism. Now, IÂ’ll appreciate if you could tell me why my first post was Â‘non-constructive criticismÂ’ and Â‘bullshitÂ’.<br><br>cheerio<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hallo there, been a loong time since i write long replies liao, time to hit the buttons again.<br><br>regarding these multi-racial and cultural issues, i wish to add on some experience regarding racial issues coming deep from the HDB enclave.<br>Few years back, there was a horrific incident involving a member of the minority race in the soccer field. He was heavily beaten up by ppl from the majority race and the next thing u knew it, he called all his fellow ethnic brothers now to settle the blood feud. The police was called in and several riot vans were arriving soon after, rounding up all the offenders. Would this be classifed as a ethnic clash? A hot news to report to the public?? The media sure didn't think so cos there was nothing in the papers regarding this incident. One old timer in the enclave told me he hadn't seen such number of riot cars since the heyday of the early 60s. In we r now in the year 2000...food for thoughts???<br><br>Could i perhaps comment on the issue of Chinese Chauvinism. As we all know, race and religion is a very sensitive issue in SG. I can hardly envision the day in which the PAP would allow the rise of C.C and their demagogues, for this directly threaten our national security and social stability. However, in this ernest to downplay this numerical superiority and tyranny, the Chinese were told not to play up issues involving their own race and culture. Low key is the buzz word. Since the post-seperation days from Malaysia, with the PAP's emphasis on economic growth and the promotion of English as our lingua franca, we witness the schism of the Chinese class, consisting of the English Educated Chinese and the Chinese Educated Chinese.<br>The first class raced ahead in this new environment and and achieved a comfortable nich in SG. The latter lagged behind due to their educational background and political inclination. (We know most Chinese schools bac in the 1950 and 60's are the hotbed of communism and the image persist up to the late 70s)<br>Would i be wrong to concluded that the latter class as mentioned before will feel resentment at being treated as second class citizen in their own majority country? Does strong emphasis on their ethnicity and culture be considered as chauvinist? What is the boundary then??? Or is this term excessively used by the ruling party to keep the Chinese in line, constantly reminding them of their precarious situation in this sea of Malay/Muslim countries? i can feel and sympathise with this group of social and ethnic class but i too, bear in mind that this IS a very sensitive issue that must be handle with care.<br>The Malays are proud of their race and culture, ditto the Indians. The Chinese??? Check out the recent survey in SG on the race they would like to be. The Chinese ranked the lowest with more chinese kids identifing themselves with Caucasians and aspiring to be like them.<br>Solutions??? More emphasis on the ground level on Chinese culture and language.<br>Effects??? Complains from within and without of a resurgent of Chinese Chauvinism.<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim<br><br>[This message has been edited by Mr Hata-san (edited 31 March 2000).]</div>

Personally I think that it's just a whole bucket of hogwash. Do you mean to say that there are actually ways and means to tell a 'race' apart from another biologically? I seriously do not think so. Well, at least the books that I've read don't tell me so.<br><br>Terence, if you're reading this, just like to clear up some doubts. Do you mean to say that there is no multi-culturalism because the dominant voice is Chinese which is associated with economic interests?<br><br>Anyway, all these race/ethnicity categories are just mere social constructs. I find it so ironic that the government can encourage racial harmony and yet say that there is racial distrust among Singaporeans. As long as it emphasises on the different 'races' that we supposedly come from, we'll never racial harmony. It becomes mere racial tolerance.<br><br>And regarding the holidays thing, cultural features that Prodigal mentioned, one would realise that even in supposedly similar nations with similar 'cultures', there is a difference in the cultural features. It is dependent on the dominant voice and what features that it chooses to accentuate to strenthen its authority and legitimise its power.<br><br>I find it similarly amusing that many would see ourselves as people without racism. WOuld you hang around Serangoon Road, Golden Mile, etc etc on weekends. If you say no, why not? Has it to do with the sense of danger? If this is not racism, I don't know what is.<br><br>What is so great about this Chineseness anyway? Why is whole month dedicated to hearing people telling you to speak in your supposed "mother tongue"? Why no speak Tamil campaign? What is this abstract idea of a mother tongue?  Does it make me less of a Chinese, Malay, Indian if I can't speak my "mother tongue"?<br><br>I certainly hope that this does not come across as coffee-bitching.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>"One of the symptoms of an approaching nervous breakdown is the belief that one's work is terribly important." - Bertrand Russell</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Terence:<br>Cal_guy,<br>*bemused smile*<br>Its interesting how the ultra right-winged always gets in a huff whenever criticised.<br>Also, the dominance of English as lingual discourse does not make a society more or less multi-cultural. It is merely the adoption of a business language. If French suddenly became the business language tomorrow, weÂ’ll obediently follow suit.</blockquote>Gee, thanks for telling me I'm an ultra right-winger. I love people who compartmentalise - it makes life so simple doesn't it. You're white or you're black, you're chinese or you're others, you're local or you're a foreigner, you're right wing or left wing etc. Now I'll know where I belong when I talk to the politically well-informed. My point about English was not that it showed SIngapore's multi-culturalism, but to rebutt your point about Chinese chauvinism being rampant here. As for adoption of a business language, why are the Japanese, Germans, Swedes, Taiwanese and Koreans all successful in the International economy? One of our perceived biggest future trade partners will be the People's Republic of China. Why then, does the Singapore Govt strongly suggest that all children enrolling into primary one should read his/her mother tongue as a 2nd LAnguage in school? Wouldn't it make far more economic sense to have these Malay or Indian children read a second language that might confer economic advantage in the future (Mandarin or Japanese for example?).<br><br><blockquote> When I said SÂ’pore was not multi-cultural, I was alluding to the ethnicity of political and media discourse. The voice of which is predominantly Chinese. And when you bellowed that thereÂ’s nothing wrong in appeasing the conservative majority, well, who are the conservative majority and does that mean there is room for only one voice given the local multi-ethnic make up?.</blockquote>Does not every government work to please the electoral majority? I absolutely agree with you that there is room for more than one-voice in the local multi-ethnic make up, and in my view it does exist. It may not be as loud as the "Chinese" voice, but that's to be expected given the dermographics isn't it? Would you expect Singapore to set up an Albanian cultural centre if we discovered a family of Albanians had decided to make their homes here? The important distinction is that no ethnic group here is prevented from enjoying it's own culture if it chooses to. To say that multi-culturalism does not exist just because Chinese culture is the most visible is like saying that only Taoism/Buddhism are practised in Singapore.<br><br><blockquote>Also, could you explain why I was out of context when I brought up ethnic marginalisation? Sure, from Kosovo to Chechnya ethnic marginalisation has resulted in dire consequences, far worse than SÂ’pore has ever seen. But that doesnÂ’t mean we cannot examine or talk about it in a local context. To sweep it under the carpet the way you seem to propose to do only serves to lure us into complacency.</blockquote>Sure we can talk about it. But have you identified a problem or offered a solution? All you say is there are so many chinese running around SIngapore, they dominate the government, therefore ethnic marginalisation occurs here. Some specific examples and constructive ideas would be most welcome. To just sit back with a knowing smile and talking down to others doesn't shake people out of complacency. It tends to make people angry and very often brings about the very worse in everyone.<br><br>[QUOTES] substantiation of the allocated importance of Chinese culture in SÂ’pore:[/QUOTES]<br><br>Thank you for the very nice summary. I found it very informative. I have no argument with you about there being an imbalance in terms of ethnic and chinese cultural representation - but the government, the chinese and I believe even the minority races don't pretend to assume otherwise. Like I said earlier in the post, it is a natural consequence of the dermographic makeup. Your argument is the Chinese dominate, therefore Singapore is not multi-cultural. Would you also say Singapore is not multi-racial? Do the Malays and Indians pretend to be Chinese in Singapore? No. Therefore, there are at least about 25% of the population going about their lives in a non-Chinese manner and engaging in whatever cultural pursuits they enjoy. Yet you say Singapore is not multi-cultural? Perhaps you can define for us your vision of multi-cultural utopia?<br><br><blockquote>6. Evidence of Chinese chauvinism? Tang Liang How? Thank goodness he was hounded out of SÂ’pore.</blockquote>There will always be individuals. If the country or the government were made up of individuals like Tang, you could bet there would be ethnic marginalisation. Thankfully, the conservative majority (Chinese as well as ethnic minorities who vote), choose not to have a country run by such people. Individuals like Tang are also a throwback to the Nanta days, I think you'll find them a dying breed in Singapore.<br><br><blockquote>7. Another interesting point. In the introduction of Â‘Religious KnowledgeÂ’ in secondary schools, Confucianism was the ONLY secular philosophy amidst major religions like Christianity, Islam, Buddhism and Hinduism. When did Confucianism suddenly become a religion? </blockquote>I hadn't realised Confucianism was being taught as a religion? Anyway, just because Confucius was Chinese, does the practice of Confucianism make one culturally Chinese? Ghandi practised a philosophy of passive non-violent protest - does that make Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, and other followers of the Gandhi philosophy Indians culturally? Are proponents of communism ethnic russian? What exactly is it about Confucian ethics that you feel will make Singaporeans more Chinese and less everything else?<br><br><blockquote>IÂ’ve given you reasons as to why I think Chinese culture dominates the political and social discourse of SÂ’pore thus creating a potential breeding ground for Chinese chauvinism. Now, IÂ’ll appreciate if you could tell me why my first post was Â‘non-constructive criticismÂ’ and Â‘bullshitÂ’.</blockquote>Your 1st post was non-constructive because you didn't bother to substantiate your points with any arguments/proof, factual or otherwise. In my view, this post of yours is much better and shows you have given the matter thought, although many of your opinions are still divergent from mine. I don't see that Chinese chauvinism will be on the rise in Singapore. I think you'll see quite the opposite. The greatest influence on our young is the media, and the dominant popular media and the pop-culture here is decidedly Western. My feeling is the Govt's tendency to overstate the multi-cultural issue is a knee jerk reaction to the threat of our young losing their cultural identity in the millieu of Boy Bands, Hollywood and the Internet.<br><br>Regards<br><br>------------------<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Genius without education is like silver in the mine.</span><br><br>Benjamin Franklin<br><br>[This message has been edited by Cal_guy (edited 31 March 2000).]</div>
