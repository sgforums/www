            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Terence:</div><div class="quote_body">cal_guy<br><br>its no point blowing hot air and then scuttling off under the pretext of pacifism. it doesn't matter one iota to me if you desire to dwell in Panglossianism or are wrought with guilt - the fact that your accusations and defence fall flat does.<br><br>cheerio</div></blockquote>Terence,<br>Just a minor clarification - I do not end my argument because of pacifism but simply a lack of energy to continue an argument that will show no outcome either way, and as you so rightly put (at least from my posts), adds no new dimensions to an age old "conflict of interests". You have made no attempt to rebutt my specific arguments apart from a few bold brush strokes blotting off all but the details you choose to see, and then putting in new points for me to counter. I have no interest for continuing in such a vein.<br><br>I made my initial posts because I felt your post gave a very one-sided streotype of the Chinese Singaporean, which I think is a big injustice to many of us. Sure there are the Chauvinists and the racists out there, but if you go through life choosing only to focus on these people and not on the myriad of others with a much more balanced view, then I fear you will grow into a bitter old man. As for "out of context Bullshit" - you allude to the influence of Islamic neighbours influencing Govt policy - right there is an example of context. Take Singapore and stick her in the middle of the Pacific and we wouldn't even need NS, much less the screening of Malays (as U claim, without evidence as far as I'm concerned). To not take these influences into consideration when criticising how the Govt handles multi-racial matters to me is an exercise in out of context bullshit. It may not be a lie, but it may not be the whole truth either. My views are more than plain to see if one bothers to read the full content of my posts (which I doubt). I have nothing new to add. In any case, you can always read about it in the Straits times.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> In the meantime, I leave you to have your last word.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Terence:  I told you before.  I have an oriental look, c'est tout.  I don't begrudge people wanting to keep their cultural heritage alive, I don't think Chinese culture is hideous or anything, I don't mind the speak Mandarin campaign posters though I don't intend to speak the language.  But I mind if someone tells me that I should do this or that <span style="font-style: italic;">because I'm a Chinese</span>.<br><br>A Chinese?  Look at me.  I don't speak the language, I don't know its philosophy or whatnots, how can I be "Chinese"?  The usual answer will be, "Then you learn them."  Oh, but if I have to learn them, won't I be the same as some Americans who learn Javanese and speak it better than many Javanese do?  Are those Americans Javanese?  If I have to learn a culture, why does it have to be Chinese?  I can learn Indian culture and I'll have to spend as much effort, right?<br><br>And Juls, exactly what I think.  Those people in Indonesia or Australia who keep saying to the ethnic Chinese to "go home to your own country", everyone forgets that China is not our own country.  I can't just sashay in there, asking to be repatriated.  They will laugh at my face because they know best that I am not Chinese.  I just look oriental and I intend to leave it at that.<br><br>------------------<br>Why be difficult when with a little more effort you can be impossible?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oh no, monamayalisa, don't get me wrong. i wasn't accusing you of being unchinese. i was just wondering what ethnicity meant to some, if it means anything at all.<br><br>i hear what you are saying. in fact its all very symptomatic of diasporas, this fracturing and dislocation. and because ethnic paradigms are intangible entities its often left open to definition. its silly, or at least too straightforward to say, hey there, you have yellow skin, slitty eyes and black hair, you must be chinese. well yeah, on one level but the mindset that's expected of a chinese is missing. and if we operate merely on the shell of ourselves then we're often off the mark when it comes to identifying ethnicity, especially of the chinese diaspora.<br><br>cheerio</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Terence, I think I wasn't answering your question, too carried away I was in the passion for "squabling".<br><br>-------------------------------<br>so what does it mean for you to be chinese then? are there necessary characteristics for chineseness at all? *wink*<br>-------------------------------<br><br>This is harder than it seems.  I may bump into some fragile egos and be accused of hating Chinese but I don't.  I don't like PRC, though.  And I wonder why there is no term for chinese beside Chinese.  I think Chinese should be reserved for people who are PRC nationals.  People of other nationality have chinese blood should have some other term to describe their ethnicity, maybe "oriental" or something.<br><br>Anyway, being chinese:  obviously he has to be chinese by blood.  then some chinese values have to be instilled in him (don't ask me which values, people say filial piety is one of those, how would I know?), then he should know and practice some chinese customs (even if it's just hong bao giving, I tried asking hong bao from my chinese granpa, he only laffed at me).  That's all.<br><br>Finally:  just wondering.  China is a huge country.  I think it should have many cultures...so which one of them is Chinese culture?<br><br>------------------<br>Why be difficult when with a little more effort you can be impossible?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I must admit I got very lost reading through the thread.  Chinese chauvinism in Singapore? Really?  Perhaps among the older generation but what the younger Chinese?<br><br>What exactly is Confucianism anyway?<br><br>Isn't the Chinese population in Singapore also extremely segmented?  Do they even have a coherent voice?  For eg, the more well-educated and successful tend to be Christian. (note I'm just observing a statistical fact here and not arguing for causation)  PM Goh even commented that there were a disproportionate number of Christians and Teochews in his cabinet for example.<br><br>And you know among the Christians there are so many different denominations etc.  Are they Confucianist too or do they subscribe more to other biblical values?<br><br>Look at our young today; materialistic, a significant number of them aping Japanese culture for example... Chinese Chauvinism?<br>Hmmmm...<br><br>I have no coherent thoughts on this issue but I find Terence's views unbalanced to say the least primarily because the Chinese population in Singapore just isn't a coherent polity.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, you wanna have a fair system, go for communism. A lot of people actually misunderstand the true meaning communism. The original idea was to allow everyone to have equal rights. This is of course an ideal system. Just a side track (and no offence to China), just look at the political system there...to me, that's not communism, but some sort of feudalism, where the people at the top and those in military force still holds substantial power.<br><br>Alternatively, listen to John Lennon's Imagine and you know that kind of idealism that we just simply cannot achieve (afterall, it's idealistic, what am I talking about!?). No religions, no nations, no identity...don't think it's gonna be possible. I think the best we can do is to remember who we are, be proud of who we are and at the same time be sensitive to others. I guess that's all I have to say to that.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>terence,<br><br>my point was that the dominant discourse requires different ethnic groups to speak their own mother tongues for instance. there lies the etablishment of CDAC, Mendaki etc. but they do not question the legibility of needing to speak in their mother tongues. it's a taken-for-granted thing that race is tied in with the language which u speak. so even when someone from their own race propose that mother tongues be given less emphasis, it is seen as "betrayal" of their race. so whatever changes that they might propose will still be accordance to the dominant discouse prescribed. i havent really thought about it regarding economic discourses though.<br><br>------------------<br>"One of the symptoms of an approaching nervous breakdown is the belief that one's work is terribly important." - Bertrand Russell</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>monamayajade,<br><br>i think the word to describe overseas chinese is chinese diaspora. its not a pretty word but there you go.<br><br>'oriental' shouldn't be used because the whole debate about orientalism as a western constuct of the orient has not died yet. too many murky areas for the term oriental to be used.<br><br>sure, you'll get a lot of reactionary people who equate language with ethnicity. they give all kinds of premises and it boils down to the deeply personal values you hold. i really don't see how being a mandarin scholar makes one more chinese than another. but then, it depends on whether you see yourself as a human being first and chinese or 'nationality' second or vice versa.<br><br>juls,<br><br>what do you mean by dominant discourse requiring different ethnic to speak their mother language? are you saying that the lingustic division will further fragmentalise the cultural mosaic thus paving the way for a monolithic ethnic (chinese) discourse, i.e. divide and rule strategy? the fear of 'betrayal' then plays right into the hands of cultural hegemony doesn't it?<br><br>cheerio</div>
