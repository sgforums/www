I received wrong info on uni$ as a result without my prior knowledge I have not claimed my UNi$ rewards in the past.  If by due date  there is no claim, the uni$ will be forefeited.   So only today then I know in the past my Uni$ was forefeited.  OH, really yuan wang !!!!   Really shit!!!!!<br><br>Calling all - think twice, thrice or consider many many times b4 u sign up for any card by UOB.  They provide very lousy service!

Anyway, I did not make any late payment and I even called and inform them I made payment by cheque one day b4 due date - I explained to them that I nearly forgot the due date so I sent cheque as I dun hv time to pay via AXS like I usually do.  So I think it is definitely not right for them to charge me interest and late charges.<br><br>furb,  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  what u mentioned is not justified.  How u expect a customer to think so much if the customer already paid b4 due date then it is not considered late payment.  UOB staff even said OK they will take note.  Come on, the bank exists to earn $$$$ to serve customers and they are to fit in to the customers' needs and convenience and not the other way round.  I stress again I did not make late payment and am not unreasonable - I was considerate to even let them know b4 the due date that I have paid  via cheque and so don't deserve such treatment from them.   If they require an earlier due date for cheque payment, then they should state clearly on the statement of account.<br><br>Furb, don't tell me if u are the boss of the bank, u expect all your customers to suit the needs and convenience of the bank.  IF this is the case , then prepare for the bank to close down.  Come on competition is so fierce among the many many local and foreign banks.<br><br>Anyway, I have made up my mind that I will stop using UOB and not have any dealing with them at all.  I find their credit card and banking services are very lousy.   Many advised me against banking with UOB or using their cards for their service is well known to be bad and UOB sucks.  A friend told me UOB stands for U OWE ME, so dats y lor they charge charge extra  to the customers !!!!<br><br></div>

Anyway, this was not the 1st time I encountered problem with them.   So nothing's gonna change my mind about their bad service.<br><br>Have u considered using other credit cards from other banks?  HSBC credit card is worthwhile to consider.  They are offering much better than UOB.  They offer $1 to $1, subscription for classic is only $36 per annum and needs 36,000 to waive annual fees.  Provide free supplement card.  When time is ripe I will switch to HSBC.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   Besides, this cardholders will be given compliment card which will allow u to enjoy benefit while shopping .</div>

Anyway, I have decided to terminate the card once the time comes.  I have enough of their bad service.  There are many other banks out there competing in the credit card business so I don't see the need to continue with them - UOB.  They don't care to improve their service, don't care about providing good service to customers - it is their loss.  There are other banks which care to provide good service, and I am giving these banks a try!!<br><br>Good luck to me and you!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
