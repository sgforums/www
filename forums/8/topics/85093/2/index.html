Fate can be planned for you in your life, but it is eventually up to your character at that point of time to make the decision whether you want to accept it or not. Nobody can force you to make a decision you don't want...except yourself.<br><br>If you keep finding yourself falling into sh|t all the time, I guess it is time for you to do some reflection into your own character/personality. Nobody can hurt you unless you yourself allows it to happen to you, it is all part of your  character at that point of time.<br><br>You are living your own life, making your own decision...that's why you are living. The purpose why you are living is to live the best possible life that you can before you eventually die.<br><br>You sounds miserable in your post and that's why I suggested that you go and find your own religion and hope that you can find peace within yourself. Life is all about choices that you make and the efforts that you put into it. Embrace life and marvel at its uncertaincies before it is too late.<br><br>I hope you will learn to enjoy life and able to enjoy life as soon as you can.</div>

U will go into another chain of fate again isn't it ? Wat if the decision u make is a part of your fate, they expect u to make tat decision. If u believes in fate fully, then u r in deep trouble.

I am just saying tat if one believes in fate fully then u r putting yourself into believing u r just part of a story and becomes less proactive, which is the wrong thing to do.
