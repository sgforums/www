The fat lady herself will find it offending as well....<br><br>There is also another case of determining whether to give up your seat to "old" people... some aint that old but they look darn weak... some are old but they look healthy.... some are more than glad that you gave your seat to them... but some will think that you are being an "extra" cos they think they are not that old what.... For muslim aunties, it's even harder to determine weather they are old cos you can only see their face.... unless it's god damn full of wrinkles...<br><br>**In short, I only give up my seat if I know exactly the condition of the person that i am giving up my seat for... I don't want to embarass myself or them, for that matter, unnecessarily...  </div></blockquote>Oh i have consider these problems before. Usually i observe them first.<br><br>For people who want a seat they will usually pay more attention in looking around for a seat instead of just glancing.<br><br>Furthermore if the person is a little weak u can sense it by the way they walk. A pregnant women will have her hands on their hips while the elderly is a little slow and deliberate with her steps. A pregnant lady usually wears baggy clothes, her dressing sense differ from those who are fat.<br><br>A classic way of giving up seat and avoid embarrassment is to give up yr seat when the person is looking at yah direction. U just stand up and walk towards the door act like u getting down soon. When they see u standing up they will usually waalk towards yah seat. Surely there will sometimes be ppl who want yr seat, to prevent this walk in their direction and block their way.</div>
