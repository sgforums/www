            <div class='col-md body'>I would also like to contribute a little incident of such similar nature.<br>i was commuting on the mrt with my wife. I saw a young chap wearing his no.4 sitting at the "give this seat up to those who needs it more" at the corner next to the exit.<br>Shortly after a pregnant(not fat but confirmed pregnant) lady came and stood next to his seat. Instantly this young soldier looked down onto the floor as if he was falling asleep with his earphones on.<br>I was pissed big time when i saw that. I was standing right infront of him and i used my leg to "tapped" his boots so that i could get his attention.<br>When he looked up and removed his earphones, i told him he should give up his seat to the pregnant lady. He instantly stand up and come face to face with me as if he was ready to pounce on me. He said that "excuse me Sir, i am an educated person, you dont have to kick me".<br>I was like "huh? U are so called fallen asleep, with earphones, how would i be able to get your attention?" And he goes on saying that i should apologies for what i did for being so rude. I did and he offered his seat to the lady. At that moment i was worried that the lady refused to sit, then wasted my effort man!<br>After the lady sat down, i swear that if my wife was not there, and he is not wearing his uniform, i would bloody hammer the shit out of him.<br>First of all, he is an able young man, serving his country, sat at that seat, actually had the audacity to fall instantly asleep when a pregnant lady was near by.....damn.....what kind of attitude is this?<br>Am i overeacted or this is trending nowadays?<br></div>
