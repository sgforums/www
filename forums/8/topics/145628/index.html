            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Beware of this conman<br>Hey ladies,this 2yrs had been a very bad year for me, due to the death of my bf late 2002(heartattack),i joined the Singaporecupid.com hoping to find new friends and so that i can forget about my pain and get on with my life. 2wks later a guy by the name of Edwin Tang Boon Hiap(nephew of CKTANGS) started to email me, after less than a week asking for my contact and started talking on the phone.He lied to me saying he pray to god 5 times a day, and everyday he will deliver food to poor ppl's home kind of bullshit.When we finally met, he was just a average looking guy.I told him later we can only be friends as there's no chemistry between the 2 of us.At that point of time, i actually got a loan from my offshore bank and wanted to venture into some biz ,after hearing that, he immediately con me into loaning him 45k saying that his Indonesian partners not in town but he needed money to buy car accessories as his client are chasing for the stocks.He promised he will repay me the next mth.Me out of gdwill loan him the money,the payment of course didn't come back,he drags and drags, alot of cock and bull stories came instead,father sick ,mother sick,sister divorcing.He lied and lied and very gd stories teller,even get the "mad lawyer" Ravi (as publish on the newspaper) to draft me a letter saying his father owed me the money instead.I still didn't suspect anything until 9 mths later 1 fine day, i suddenly decide to do a bankrupt chk on his status. i was very very devastated,i almost died i tell u,he was already a bankrupt be4 we even met.So i lodge a complaint with his official assignee,and was told he will have to go to jail as it is a very serious offence.Anyway he begged and promised to repay me saying he will use his cpf to buy a HDB flat using the cashback(illegal)method to repay me, i waited until for 9mths,i started to realised HDB only take 3mths to complete the whole selling and buying procedure(very gullible and dumb?).By then it was too late he was suddenly sent to jail for 2 mths due to a guy who the same kind of victim like me lodge a complaint to his OA and action was taken. I almost died of that again,i wrote him a letter to the jail and threaten to take legal action against him and so he won't have to be release so soon. But he replied me by telling me was under going chapel counselling there and asking me not to report him as he has repent and will settle my debt immediately after his release in OCt and will come out and touch every1's heart!!! On hearing that i decided to give him a chance to repent.But instead of contacting me,he went MIA!!! He is unreachable now,and i am working with my lawyer to reopen his case and that and will make him a second time bankrupt and hope he will go to jail again, and now the bank is chasing me to repay them the money, i am really in deep shit! so ladies out there, beware of this ******* you could be his next target...if whoever know his contact pls alert me Last but not least, i have found a new man after the death of my last bf and will be getting married next y.He is a very loving and caring and very very supportive person,we are going thru these setback together so i am not alone anymore, and i m very glad that we had found each other Hope i didn't bore u gals with my story</blockquote>Somehow I don't really understand why ppl fall for it.  Don't get me wrong.  I do feel sorry for such victims.  I am just wondering whether con man like this is really so convincing in their sad stories that women tend to fall into it.<br><br>Once upon a time, one guy tried that.  He even tried to con me into buying him a very expensive handphone (almost $1000) by talking about it every day and night.  In the end... I bought it for myself.  I stopped talking to him totally.<br><br>One year later, he tried calling me but I refused to pick up the phone.  He tried calling a few times and sms me to say want to catch up.  If I ever pick up his call by mistake, I will probably greet him with "Forget it.  I'm broke now!"<br><br>The other time, another guy tried to do that also, by telling me to use my Personal Credit to pay for his credit card and he will pay me back every month.  I told him,"My pay is less than $2000.  I don't have Personal Credit A/c.  I cannot help you."  Then I went to tell his ex gf "Why your ex bf like that one ah?"  Then his ex gf said "Wa lao.  I feel like spitting at him now"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The most shocking thing is....<br><br>The person who posted the first msg wasn't the first and only one.<br>Subsequently, there were a few replies saying that they met this guy too and he also tried borrowing money from them.  They all met him thru internet, I think.<br><br>Here's one of the replies:<br><span style="color: blue;">You are not alone. Apparently he likes to target people from the internet. I got to know him via the ICQ. I have so many friends that have gotten conned by this man, including myself. He did not start his investment scheme until about a year after i got to know him. At that time, me and my then bf wanted to start out doing property. So we consulted him as he was doing property at that time. He was very nice and he offered to print us namecards and stuff and taught us stuff we need to know for doing rental. We found him nice and so helpful. A few months later, he told us that there is this investment scheme for charity, to invest and we will get back returns on it and we will be helping his friend too as he is helping his friend to raise money for his illness or something. We thought...since he is so kind, just help him lorz and besides he does not look like he will cheat us of our money at that time. After we get back our money and returns from the charity thing, He smoothed talk us into investing more in his company and then saying that we will get more returns out of it. This happened in 2002 and it has been a long and painful 3 years. Because of greed, we borrowed alot of money from banks and etc and now we are servicing it with our hard earned money. Alot of people's money are involved here. He is really worst than a beast. He keeps coming up with excuses when he could not pay us and then started changing numbers, declared bankrupt and then avoiding our calls and then finally MIA. We went to CAD to report him but the CAD officer said that there is nothing much we can do about him as there are people who actually gotten money back from the investment in his company.<br><br>I was so naive and dumb to have invested so much money into this stupid person. He appeared to be very charitable and a very staunch and good christian. He really looked quite trust worthy then. BUT Whatever he says are a pack of lies. He keeps saying that his mother is weak and father always going to see doctor and so on and forth....crapz really....He is not even the nephew of CK Tang. Apparently he is a long distance relative to CK Tang so not directly related to him. It seems that he uses this to gain trust in people. A really big lesson learnt for me. Money lost, friendships lost. He is really a big conman.<br><br>What can we do in regards to this? Would anyone have his number?</span></div>

Going to his OA will make his life really really difficult,because if so many of us were being conned after he declared bankrupt.he will be in deep sh<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>it.He will defintely go to jail,this time much longer than before.We are able to sue him for 2nd time bankrupt,so if he doesn't want that to happened because he is already 950,000 in debt from what my lawyer told me. Perhaps he will have to think of ways to pay us, if he still wants to see the daylight. He cannot be discharged unless he has clear all his debts.
