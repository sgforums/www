              <p>You will never know till you try. You'll have to buildup courage 1st by singing to your friends and family etc since if you do not dare to sing in front of others, no matter how good your voice is, you also won't be able to do anything with it.</p>
              <p>Self confidence etc must come from within and not something others can really give you or help you with except by giving you moral support.</p>

              <p>but a min later, a beautiful and melodic voice filled the air that sounded like an angel, and i was surprised and shocked it was the blind person</p>

              <p>Well.. I think first, you need to really enjoy singing.</p>
              <p>Enjoy the music, enjoy the feelings, enjoy sharing music with your friends and don't think of singing as a performance, as something you are 'showing' to people, but just as a part of yourself. Have a GOOD TIME!</p>
              <p>Don't be a 'wanna be' - just BE someone who loves to sing, and enjoys the expression of music. Everything else will come along~ whether it is joining a music school or a competition.</p>
              <p>Then it wouldn't matter if you are good or bad (and since people have
              praised you, at the very least, you can carry a tune!) and you lose the
              consciousness and awkwardness that accompanies a  'performance'.</p>
