            <div class='col-md body'>JUST two months after he was nabbed in Thailand, Bali bomb blast mastermind Hambali, 39, is reportedly singing like a canary, revealing to his interrogators deadly plots of the Jemaah Islamiah (JI) terror network.<br><br>The former operations chief of JI, now in US custody on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia, is said to have told his captors that a Malaysian suicide cell of four terrorists is on the prowl to strike "certain targets".<br><br>In another explosive revelation, he said that Al Qaeda wanted to build a biological warfare plant in Indonesia to produce weapons to deliver anthrax, Australia's Sunday Herald Sun newspaper reported yesterday.<br><br>On the plot in Malaysia, Hambali saidb that the Malaysians have sworn an oath of loyalty to die for Al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden's cause.<br><br>He did not reveal details of the sabotage plans.<br><br>Interrogators were told that "Osama discussed their commitment to Allah with the group and told them that their duty was to suffer", the paper said, quoting from an interview transcript in which Hambali admitted JI's involvement in the Jakarta Marriott Hotel blast in August.<br><br>He told his interrogators that the Al Qaeda-linked JI "always found strong support at the grassroots level in Indonesia".<br><br>He said that many members of JI's Indonesian cells are currently hiding in the Philippines and supporting the Moro Islamic Liberation Front(MILF).<br><br>On the anthrax project, Hambali said he recruited a Malaysian, Yazid Sufaat, who has a degree in chemistry and lab science from California State University in Sacramento.<br><br>Yazid is currently detained under the Internal Security Act in Malaysia.<br><br>During his interrogation, West Java-born Hambali, whose real name is Riduan Isamuddin, boasted that the terror organisation still had widespread grassroots support in Indonesia and a strong presence in the Philippines.<br><br>But he also said that JI had been crippled by almost 200 arrests following the Bali blasts.<br><br>The transcript of Hambali's comments read: "The captive (Hambali) kept insisting that JI was breaking down because of those who had been captured.<br><br>"All the group's savings have been lost to raids and arrests. JI is now totally dependent on Al Qaeda for money."<br><br>Hambali was arrested in Thailand in August, and has since been questioned about his role in JI and its links to Al Qaeda.<br><br>The interrogation transcript reveals that Hambali's arrest has led to new insights into how the Bali bombings were planned and that JI is well-equipped to carry out more attacks.<br><br>In the interrogations, Hambali even named his brother, Gunawan, as a main conduit to Al Qaeda.<br><br>Now under arrest in Pakistan, Gunawan, 26, was a go-between for Hambali and Al Qaeda, at times even passing on cash, the paper reported.<br><br>Hambali's interrogator reportedly said: "After giving some phone numbers and addresses to his brother or vice versa, Al Qaeda's operatives began to make direct contact with (Hambali's) messenger and made specific operational actions/transactions, including money transfers."<br><br>He revealed how an e-mail from Hambali, saying, "I am starting a business and I need capital," was actually a coded request for funds to attack the Marriott Hotel in Jakarta.<br><br>Hambali provided US$30,000 (S$51,700) to fund the Marriott bombing and wanted another US$15,000 kept aside for the families of the Bali bombers.<br><br>He has also been funding MILF guerillas in the Philippines.<br><br>In June he gave them US$27,000.<br><br>On Saturday, Indonesian Security Minister Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said that Jakarta has been given permission to interview Hambali.<br><br><a href="http://www.asia1.com.sg/streats/20031013_story2_1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.asia1.com.sg/streats/20031013_story2_1.html</a><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
