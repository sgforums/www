            <div class='col-md body'>Predictions of TEOTWAWKI (The end of the world as we know it):<br><br>Near future: The American Traditional Catholic Church predicts that "the three days of darkness" will envelop the earth shortly. As a warning sign, a cross will appear in the heavens so that all can see. The family and society will fall apart. "...the gates of Hell will be opened and satan and his demons shall be released and given authority to roam the earth without limitation. There will be complete darkness for three days. " It will be as if time has come to a stand still. The only source of light will be from candles blessed according to the traditional Rites of the Church Catholic." 23<br><br>Near future: AgapePress reported that Bishop Huey Harris of the First Pentecostal Tabernacle in Elkton, MD  73-year-old  said: "What I'm seeing is the Scriptures being fulfilled right before our very eyes." AgapePress reports: "He says what he is looking for next is for the Church to be raptured, and then Jews receiving Christ as their Messiah."<br><br>1999 to 2009: Jerry Falwell predicted in 1999-JAN that Jesus could return within ten years. But before that can happen, he said that the Antichrist must appear. Referring to the Antichrist, Falwell said: "Is he alive and here today? Probably. Because when he appears during the Tribulation period he will be a full-grown counterfeit of Christ. Of course he'll be Jewish. Of course he'll pretend to be Christ. And if in fact the Lord is coming soon, and he'll be an adult at the presentation of himself, he must be alive somewhere today." Rabbi James Rudin of the American Jewish Committee suggested that Christians should be careful about making such comments. His said that Falwell's statement "plays into some latent and historical anti-Semitism from the past." 2  Rev. Falwell later apologized for his comment.<br><br>21st century: Thomas Chase 11 predicts that when the world's population reaches 6.66 billion, the war of Armageddon may occur. In early 1999, it reached 6.0 billion.<br><br>2003: Sree Vishiva Karma Veera Narayana Murthy, an avatar of Krishna will arrive to establish a 108 year reign of dharma (righteousness). This will be preceded by four years of: a rain of blood in towns and villages, circulation of poor quality coins, the appearance of male goats and oxen with mammary glands that can be milked, and the appearance of many incurable diseases.<br><br>2003-MAY-15: The Pana Wave Laboratory group in Japan believes that the world will be destroyed by a series of disasters on this date. A planet will move close to the earth and will cause "cataclysmic" changes. The earth's magnetic pole will reverse on this day, and cause tidal waves and earthquakes. In early May, they set up a camp on a mountain road 170 miles west of Tokyo. They covered their vehicles with white cloths, which they believe will protect their leader and members from "harmful electromagnetic waves," which they think originate from communists. The group was established in 1977 and has about 1,200 members in Japan. Their leader, Yuko Chino, 69, preaches a blend of Christianity, Buddhism and New Age beliefs.<br><br>2003-Late spring/early summer: Space aliens called Zetas are communicating through their earthly contact, Nancy. They describe how a comet visits earth every 3657 years. During this pass, the earth will pass through its tail. This will stop the earth's rotation for a few days. There will be "gigantic Lightning Bolts occur in the upper atmosphere, Violent Winds occur, and petrochemicals formed in the skies rain down in Firestorms; then, as the core of the Earth attempts to align magnetically with the giant comet, there is a Pole Shift with Continental Rip and Sinking and Rising land; how gigantic Tidal Waves assault the coasts, though Water Movement began when rotation stopped, and an Ocean Vortex can form; how plate shifts can result in a Sinking Atlantic floor, affecting the surrounding shorelines; but how the Other Planets will be little affected." The earth will start rotating again, but with new poles, equator, geography and climate. The ice caps will melt and the ocean will put shorelines under water. Sounds like a wild ride. 4<br><br>2004-OCT-17: Clay Cantrell computes the date of the Rapture from size of Noah's Ark with particular attention to the precise location of the "escape window" in the top of the vessel.<br><br>Late 2004: Arnie Stanton noted on 1997-SEP-16 that that evening was the fourth Jewish festival since 1996-APR-3 on which a lunar eclipse occurred. 5 He quotes Luke 21:25-26 which mentions "signs in the sun, in the moon and in the stars and on the earth distress of nations" He believes that "these recent lunar eclipses are the last known astronomical signs that will precede a 7 year (360 day/year) countdown to Armageddon/Christ's return to the Earth." He expects that Christ's return will occur within a few months of 2004-SEP-29 when Asteroid Toutatis will make a very close approach to the Earth - perhaps even a collision!<br><br>2006: Annie Stanton predicts that a 14.4 mile long asteroid will collide with the earth. Jesus will arrive and a 1000 year period of peace starts.<br><br>2006: According to the Sunday Times in England, a religious group called "The Family" anticipates the end of the world in 2006. "Members are said to be stockpiling food and planning to hide in caves in India."<br><br>2006: According to the Weekly world News for 2001-FEB-13, hydrogen bombs hidden in London, Washington and Tel Aviv will be detonated. This will be the start of the war of Armageddon<br><br>2007: According to the Weekly world News for 2001-FEB-13, the rapture will occur on the 7th hour of the 7th day of the 7th month of the Hebrew calendar year that corresponds to 2007 CE. Jesus will appear simultaneously in Jerusalem, Baghdad, Washington, Moscow and in every other capital city of the world.<br><br>2008-MAR-21: After a lengthy calculation based on the Bible, a British group, The Lord's Witnesses, has concluded that the start of Armageddon will happen on this day. Three quarters of the world's population will die during the subsequent war. This will be preceded by the United Nations taking over complete rulership of the world in the lunar month preceding 2001-APR-24. This is exactly 666 Hebrew months after the founding of the United Nations in 1945. 22<br><br>2008-APR-6: Philip B. Brown incorrectly predicted that the Great Tribulation would start on 2001-APR-7, with the appearance of the the two witnesses described in Revelation. He also predicted that the start of Jesus' millennial reign would be on 2008-APR-6. 27<br><br>1998 to-2012 Gordon-Michael Scallion predicts major catastrophic earth events: global warming, melting polar ice caps, earthquakes, volcanoes erupting, etc.<br><br>2012: Michael Drosnin, author of "The Bible Code," found a hidden message in the Pentateuch (the first five books in the Bible) that predicts that a comet will crash into the earth in 2012 and annihilate all life. As a minimum, I suspect that at least one species will survive: cockroaches.<br><br>2012: Kev Peacock predicts that the Sun's magnetic field will reverse, and induce a reversal of the Earth's field. This will cause massive geothermal and tectonic catastrophes. Something will happen to the mythical island of Atlantis.<br><br>2012-DEC-21: The Mayan calendar expressed a date in the form: 6.19.18.1.5 This means:  6 Baktun, an interval of 144,000 days,<br>19 Katun (generations) of 7200 days,<br>18 Tun (years) of 360 days,<br>1 Uinal (month) of 20 days,<br>5 Kin (days)<br>for a total of 1,007,305 days. J. Eric Thompson determined that the first day of their calendar (0.0.0.0.0) was on 3114-AUG-11 BCE according to the Gregorian calendar. 5 This was when they believed that Venus was born. Another source says that this happened on AUG-13 of the same year. Mayans also had a "Great Cycle of the Long Count" of 13 Baktuns or 5,125.36 years. Many interpreters believe that the Mayans expected that the universe would last exactly that length of time. That is, they anticipated the end of the world at the Winter Solstice. 2012-DEC-21 or 13.0.0.0.0 in their notation. 6  John Jenkins has determined that on this date, there will be "an extremely close conjunction of the winter solstice sun with the crossing point of Galactic Equator and the ecliptic." This is an event that will not be repeated for thousands of years. Author Carl Johan Calleman disagrees that the Mayan calendar predicts the end of the world. He writes that "the Mayan calendar is about the progress of evolution, not about the end of the world." 25<br><br>2012-DEC-21: Terence McKenna predicts that at "the moment of the solstice and the heliacal rising of the galactic center, levels of planetary novelty will exponentially increase." The results of this "ultranovel event" are difficult to predict, but may include "Hyperspatial Breakthrough, Planetesimal Impact, Alien Contact, Historical Metamorphosis, Metamorphosis of Natural Law, Solar Explosion, Quasar Ignition at the Galactic Core." Some of these don't sound too healthy for life on earth. 17  I am personally hoping for the latter, because it would take may years for any effects of that ignition to impact earth -- long past my life expectancy.<br><br>2012-DEC-24: A visitor to our web site predicts that on this day, one third of the Ort cloud will rain down on the earth. The Ort cloud is a incredibly large collection of comets that encircle the solar system. Devastation would be total.<br><br>2014: According to Sun magazine for 1999-DEC-21, Pope Leo IX (1513-1522) wrote on 1514: "I will not see the end of the world, nor will you my brethren, for its time is long in the future, 500 years hence."<br><br>2016: An article in Weekly World News describes a find by a Professor Lloyd Cunningdale of Salt Lake City who was excavating with his students at the site of the famous Donner party disaster of 1847. The latter were a group of settlers bound for California who became trapped by snow in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Cunningdale and students have found a time capsule left by the settlers which contains many predictions for the future. They predict that nations will abandon traditional methods of conflict and resort to the use of biological warfare. In 2016, one such disease will spread and kill all of the humans on the planet. 7<br><br>2017: The "Sword of God Brotherhood" believes that Armageddon will occur in 2017. The Prophet Gabriel has told them this. Only their own members will survive to repopulate the world. All of the others (including you and me) will "perish in hellfire." 8<br><br>Before 2018: The web site "A Nightmare for Everyone and the Countdown to 2000," predicts that an asteroid and comet will hit the earth, sometime between the re-creation of Israel in 1948 and 2018. See: http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Forum/8990/<br><br>2020s or 2030s: Bill Joy, co-founder and chief scientist of Sun Microsystems predicted the end of humanity in within 20 or 30 years, in an article in the 2000-APR issue of Wired Magazine. He wrote that leading-edge technologies such as robotics, genetic engineering and nano-tech may soon lead to the extinction of human society. 24<br><br>Before 2024: A web site titled "Fire from the sky: Meteors and Biblical Prophecy," predicts that a meteor (actually a meteorite) "could" hit the earth in the next 25 years. This would cause fireballs of debris, tidal waves, supher [sic] dioxide, a "red tide" in the oceans, and a dust cloud.<br><br>2028-OCT: Asteroid "1997 XF11" will approach close to earth. At first, scientists were concerned that there was a small probability that it might impact earth. However, data from 1990 has indicated that it will miss earth by about 600,000 miles. 21 Still, this is a near miss, as astronomical distances go.<br><br>About 2028: A visitor to this web site from Norway has analyzed biblical chronologies and determined to his satisfaction that "Jesus became Messiah [about the year 28 CE] exactly 4000 years after Creation." He believes that God created the world to last 6,000 years. Thus, the end of the world will happen about 2028.<br>Before 2038: Greenpeace predicts massive starvation due to population growth. Global warning will melt the polar ice caps and cause massive coastal flooding. Thousands of plant and animal species become extinct.<br><br>2038:  The book "The Bible and the Future" predicts that "large percentage of the world's population will die in a series of severe punishments from God" at this time. See: http://www.alltheearth.com/future/summary.htm<br><br>2047-SEP-14: According to The Church of !BLAIR!, the human race will probably be terminated at 3:28 AM (Soho, England time). The church teaches, with tongue firmly in cheek, that if the human race does not discard their plastic conformity, then the Gods will withdraw their protection. The Gods don't want us to worship them; they don't want sacrifices or even offerings. They just want us to rid itself of our excessive "Normalcy". At that point, Astro-Lemurs (extra-terrestrials similar in shape to lemurs, but with rainbow colored bodies) will attack the entire human race and beat them to death with gigantic burritos. You have been warned. ;-)<br><br>2060: Sir Isaac Newton, Britain's greatest scientist, analyzed the Bible, which he believed contained God's secret laws of the universe. He concluded that the end of the world will happen in the year 2060. According to Malcolm Neaum, the producer of a TV documentary on Newton: "He spent something like 50 years and wrote 4,500 pages trying to predict when the end of the world was coming. But until now it was not known that he ever wrote down a final figure. He was very reluctant to do so."  26<br><br>2076: Bede the Venerable, an 8th century Christian theologian computed Jesus birth as 3,942 years after the world's creation. The 6,000 year millennial week will thus end in this year.<br><br>2076: Some Sufi sects expect the end of the world in this year, which is the year 1,500 in the Muslim calendar.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
