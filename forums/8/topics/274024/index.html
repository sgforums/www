            <div class='col-md body'>BEIJING (AFP) - A Beijing television journalist has been jailed for one year for fabricating a report about cardboard-stuffed buns that embarrassed China during a barrage of food scandals, state media said Monday.<br><br>ADVERTISEMENT<br><br>Zi Beijia, a temporary employee at Beijing TV, was also fined 1,000 yuan (130 dollars) after a court on Sunday found him guilty of "infringing the reputation of a commodity", the Beijing News reported.<br><br>The court said Zi orchestrated a news report last month that street vendors in the city were selling baozi -- a popular bun-like snack usually filled with meat or vegetables -- containing chemically-softened cardboard.<br><br>The broadcast came amid mounting reports of shoddy or dangerous Chinese foods, and other merchandise and generated wide local and international interest.<br><br>It also embarrassed the government, which had been denying that China had a big problem with fake or dangerous products and had accused foreign media of sensational reporting on the issue.<br><br>Beijing TV, like all media groups under the control of the government, later declared the report bogus and sacked Zi. It said he had instructed a group of migrant workers to make the phony buns while he filmed them.<br><br>"The programme caused evil social effects and severely ruined the reputation of the relevant commodities," according to the court ruling.<br><br>The official Xinhua news agency said Zi pleaded guilty to the charges, and claimed he was "muddled-headed" when he produced the report.<br><br>However there has been some speculation that Zi was in fact a scapegoat and that the report was genuine.<br><br>Xinhua was one of the state-run news organisations that had earlier carried reports citing cynical Chinese saying Zi could have been the fall guy for the government as it tried to squelch embarrassing news.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">But Xinhua also reported on Sunday that following the Beijing TV case, at least 60 newspapers had signed a declaration "to root out fabricated news in all newspapers and rebuild the credibility of the media</span></strong>."<br><br>How ironic!<br><br><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070813/wl_asia_afp/healthchinafoodsafetymediatrial" rel="nofollow">http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070813/wl_asia_afp/healthchinafoodsafetymediatrial</a></div>
