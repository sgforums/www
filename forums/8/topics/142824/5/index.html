I'm a late starter, im 27 this year.<br><br>I'm currently taking lessons from a private tutor, the lesson course follows a book called 'Alfredo's basic adult piano course' Level one. I also recently bought a 2nd hand yamaha clavinova CLP840 upon recomendation from my tutor. On average, i spend around 1-2 hrs a day to practise, now covered slightly over half the book.<br><br>Anyone got any advise for late learners like me, on how to improve and upgrade faster or something?

Do that consistently, and you'll definitely see results.<br><br>Also, don't need to always follow the pace of the teacher. If you really mastered what you'ved learned (notes correct, rhythm correct), you can go try other songs ahead.<br><br>Better still, find some pop scores or something to spice up the experience. It could be pretty boring to be always practising exercise scores.<br><br>Actually, i think once you hit higher grades(near 8 ), it would be much more fun and inspiring experience to be able to play the songs you hear on your CDs(ie Mozart's Rondo Alla Turca, Chopin's Nocturne - take them as a challenge cos it's possible)...the middle grades were actually the toughest phase for me.
