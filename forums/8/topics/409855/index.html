              <p>2 metres tall????i think people of that height need to custom make clothes from a tailor.usually they have the tailor with bales of cloth of your choice.its rare getting clothes or even a t-shirt of that size in singapore or south east asia even.</p>
              <p>best  to get them on ebay mostly direct from manufacturer.</p>

              <p><br>If you have not already noticed, clothes here don't come in different lengths like the USA.</p>
              <p>A good bet for you would be Robinsons and Marks &amp; Spencer and Gap though expect to pay more.</p>
              <p>Worse case, you buy your clothes online since we don't have American Eagle or Old Navy here in Singapore.</p>

              <p>June 8, 2010 -- Short people have a higher risk of heart health problems than tall people, according to a new study.</p>
              <p>"The shorter you are, the higher risk you have of developing 
              cardiovascular disease," says Tuula Paajanen, MD, a researcher at the 
              University of Tampere, Finland.</p>
              <p>Short people, she found, also had an increased risk of heart 
              attacks and earlier death than taller people. Overall, she says, the 
              risk of getting <a href="http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=87976">heart disease</a> and dying from it early is 1.5 times higher for short people than for tall people.</p>
              <p>The report, in which Paajanen analyzes 52 previously published studies, is published in the <em>European Heart Journal.</em></p>
              <p>For nearly 60 years, researchers have debated a potential link 
              between height and heart disease, with the first report finding short 
              people at a health disadvantage published in 1951.</p>
              <p>So Paajanen and her team did medical literature searches, 
              selecting the most scientifically sound studies -- totaling 52 -- from 
              the 1,907 articles she found on the topic. In all, more than 3 million 
              people were included in the 52 studies they reviewed.</p>
              <h3>What's Short? What's Tall?</h3>
              <p>Short and tall are relative, of course, so for the review 
              Paajanen compared the tallest groups with the shortest groups, defining 
              each.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Short men were defined as those less than about 5 feet 5 inches tall, while short women were those below about 5 feet.</li>
              <li>Tall men were those over about 5 feet 9 and 1/2 inches, and tall women over about 5 feet 5 and 1/2 inches.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>After analyzing all 52 studies, Paajanen found an increased risk 
              for health problems and earlier death for the shortest group compared to
               the tallest.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Short stature increased the risk of heart disease illness and death by 1.5 times.</li>
              <li>Short men had a 37% increased risk for dying from any cause, and short women a 55% increased risk.</li>
              <li>Both short men and short women had a 52% increased risk of having a <a href="http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=379">heart attack</a>.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Exactly why the shortest people had more heart disease and 
              earlier death than the tallest isn't known, but Paajanen can speculate. 
              "My favorite hypothesis is that shorter people would have narrower 
              arteries, because this hypothesis hasn't been studied very much. In 
              recent studies using angiographic measurements, the coronary artery 
              diameter was correlated with height and body weight, so there might be a
               point to it," she tells WebMD.</p>
              <p>The smaller arteries, she speculates, may be occluded earlier in 
              life, leading to heart disease, due to factors such as poorer 
              socioeconomic background and poor <a href="http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=10192">nutrition</a>, for instance.</p>
              <p>Paajanen says that her results suggest that "height may be 
              considered a possible independent factor" when physicians are 
              calculating a person's heart disease risk.</p>

              <p>yes..........it's true...............becoz the heart has to work
              so hard pumping blood to the rest of the ''longer'' body
              parts..............the dick has to pay the ultimate
              price................</p>
              <p>however, shorter guys have another problem...............one
              testicle is much smaller than the other.............</p>

              <p>I'm about 193 cm tall and I'm having a hell of a time finding clothes. When I've asked some locals I know, they all give me stores downtown which are marketing to rich expats who wear suits and slacks...of which I am not. I usually shop at American Eagle (ae.com) in the US, so anything around the same style (I don't need Dockers or skinny jeans) and price range would be ideal. My shirt sizes are typically XL Long....any idea?</p>
