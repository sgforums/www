            <div class='col-md body'>Many people out there have this thought in their mind long ago.<br><br>WHY!!!!!!!!! is the first word that came out from these people mouth.<br><br>Charity shows for example like NKF have always been lucky to raise enough money for the needy patients. They are able to reach their target amount every year dispite many of us facing financial crisis. That shows that Singaporean are very generous and kind. So proud of you.<br><br>To encourage fellow people to make their phone calls to donate, the following organiser have also invited many foreign artiste to perform. Famous boy bands like 5566 &amp; Energy recently have also came to Singapore to do their bit for the charity. Their presence actually made a difference and it actually contributed alot to the amount of money accumulated. Their fans will be busy pressing the numbers whenever is their turn on the stage to either sing or perform stunts.<br><br>Not forgeting our local Mediacorp artiste. They also did many dangerous stunts to attract callers. With the glib tongue host,Mr Chao, every we manage to pull through the target being set.<br><br>One thing we question ourself all the time. Why is there a need to give away thousands of dollars of prizes away to callers ? Instead of donating this huge amount to the charity. Im sure readers are getting the drift now.<br><br>Condo,Cars,cash,credit cards....etc... these stuffs r given away every year.<br><br>When we donate money, there they are giving away money.<br>Donating is all about giving from the heart to help those who are in need and ill stricken. Personally i dont expect any reward for donating. What abt u?<br><br>I can still remember there was a kind hearted donor who won few thousand cash and he donate part of it to charity. I respect him to the core.<br><br>Living in a Kind and Generous society i believe that we dont need to be lure to donate during critical times. Take Tsunami Donation as an example.<br><br>Do we have Cars and Condos as prizes to be given away to the lucky donors?<br>In the end. Singapore have raise millions of dollars to help Tsunami affected countries. Dont you think we deserve the applause?*clap Clap*<br><br>NKF charity show should take this matter into consideration that we should try to remove the prizes in future. If the sponsors are nice, just donate the prizes to the charity. Whatever it is be it condos,cars,cash or credit cards. Im sure Singaporeans r cool with it and nevermind abt no prizes to be given away.<br><br>Those patients looks on their face are enough to sink our hearts and make our donations. Seeing them cry over the Live Telecast when interviewed made everyone go slient with tears in their eyes. Helping these people is something we are more then willing to do.<br><br>So i hope that if theres sponsors out there to give prize away the next time just tell them to donate the prizes to charity instead. Cos these amount means alot to them and it makes a big difference.<br><br>Cheers.</div>
