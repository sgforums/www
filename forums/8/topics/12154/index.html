            <div class='col-md body'>This is quoted from straits times 28 July 2001:<br><br>Panel says yes to fourth university<br>-------------------------------------<br>A high-level committee has said it should have a strong technical bent, work closely with industry and provide flexible learning opportunities<br>-------------------------------------<br><br>With the declaration of the formation of the 4th University in Singapore, I personally feel quite skeptical regarding the standard and the kind of recommendations make by the high-level committee.<br><br>Firstly, the general idea that this university will be solely for polytechnic graduates is off. It was stated by the committee: "A major consideration, the report says, would be making it easy for National Technical Certificate, A-level and diploma holders, mature students, mid-career workers and foreigners to study full-time or part-time."<br><br>What does this imply? Even a person with NTC certificate also are enrolled into the university!? Does that make people with diploma certificates from the 4 polytechnic in singapore worthless or even degrading? Then what is the worth of the degree cert?<br><br>Secondly, as compare to NUS and NTU, wouldn't this 4th University be taken as a 2nd or 3rd grade university and be considered as a dumping for people who did not manage to get into NUS and NTU?<br>Even the recently formed SMU, is not so recognised at all. Maybe in singapore but not in overseas.<br><br>Recently, I have a friend who graduated with a master course from University of Essex, and he even told me that there are students down there who don't even know what is NUS and NTU (becos they don't know where is singapore). Don't even talk about SMU and worst till, the 4th university.<br><br>Thirdly, by allowing mid-career workers or foreigners to take part-time degree, isn't it something like a open-U? Or can I say that it is comparable to SIM?!<br><br>Personally, I am a polytechnic graduate from NP and I did not manage to get enrol into NUS or NTU for twice, due to one of my subject having a P (supplementary paper). This has put me into a dilemma of going to overseas to get a degree, but I have to work a few years so as to save sufficient amount to be able to afford the expenses.<br><br>Now, with the committee delcaring the approval for the formation of the 4th University, I have to think twice again to go overseas.<br>But it seems to be that the pros are more than the cons for the 4th U in singapore, due to the above reasons.<br>This 4th university may not be that recognised as compare to NUS and NTU and it even allows NTC cert people to get in. I feel a bit pathetic about this issue.<br><br>Can anyone comment on this issue?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br><img src="http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/features/planets/jupiter/io.gif"><br><br>[This message has been edited by OrionNebula (edited 01 August 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I refer to the article, Â“Panel says yes to fourth universityÂ” (ST, 28 July), which reported the recommendations of a high-level committee that a fourth university in order to succeed, it should differentiate itself from the other three and Â“aim to produce people with the entrepreneurial drive to take ideas to the market as well as to create new marketsÂ”.<br><br>With regards to the above quotation, it coerces me to conclude that the existing three universities are not producing people with the entrepreneurial drive to succeed in the new economy. Is this statement fair to the other three universities?<br><br>While I could not agree more with the report that a fourth university would prevent brain drain of local talents, and to allow a wide spectrum of people easy access to university education by pursuing part-time or full-time degree courses, I feel that four universities might be too many for a small Singapore.<br><br>We had witnessed the merging of banks, financial companies and even opposition political parties in order to have a strong foothold in their respective areas. Why are we observing a reverse trend of opening up more and more universities? Universities too need to have a strong foothold not only in the local, but also in the regional and if possible, the global academia scene. By having too many universities, there might be duplication of resources, which is wasteful. Furthermore, our 3rd university is based on Wharton's syllabus, shouldnÂ’t that be international enough?<br><br>I hope that the committee can crusade their innovative ideas by applying it to the existing three universities. This will allow more flexibility in the universities operations such as opening up courses for the targeted students mentioned in the report, rather than setting up a fourth university.<br><br>lastly, totally agree with all above replies. Thumbs up~! (",)</div>
