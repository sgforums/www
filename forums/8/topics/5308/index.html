            <div class='col-md body'>Yep, time helps. Slowly but surely.<br><br>Another thing to do is to keep yourself busy, like talking to close friends that you might have neglected recently. Try to concentrate on what you have at the moment. That helps with confidence as well. Also, don't try cut yourself off everything else. Do whatever comes your way, like when friends invite you your for dinner or something.<br><br>All the best.<br><br>[This message has been edited by pacman (edited 28-11-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Besides time, have u turned to yur frens as well? Frens are great company in driving away the loneliness after breakups. Most pple tend to wallow in self-pity and think that its the end of the world. Then they will go out alone, or visit those places where they used to go to, to re-live the feeling. Yeah, give yurself the chance to really scream and shout and do these nonsensical things, for a while, so as to vent the frustration. But set yurself a deadline, say 1 month, after which u shld make a promise to yurself NoT 2B SaD anymore. U owe it to yurself to live fully and happily.<br><br>Life is a series of ups and downs, u are now at "down" so "up" shld come next rite?<br><br>Cheer up! :O)<br><br>[This message has been edited by tictac (edited 29-11-1999).]</div>
