              <p>I think that living in a rental house or flat is better initially, but nowadays these new couples always use all their savings and wedding gift money to buy a new flat/house. </p>
              <p>Don't you think that renting out a place is better, unless you know much about real estate and think that it is a good investment. Buying and owning a house is also good, as after all, a house is for living in, and not for trading and crap. </p>
              <p>If you are an adult, what would you do?</p>
              <p>1.Buy your own house/flat.</p>
              <p>2.Rent out a house/flat</p>
              <p>3.Live with your parents .</p>

              <p>I'm 36 living with parent. I don't see myself being a loser with that.</p>
              <p>My parent have to use my name to buy an old, small and smelly hdb unit. They have already used my name more then 2 time to purchase in the past and this time still managed to get hdb concessionary loan with tons of appeals. I doubts I'll see myself having this privilege again in the future like having my own home with my future wife..</p>
              <p>All in all i'm basically supporting them 50% and both 2 of my sibiling whom have married out, contributes in a regular basis.</p>
              <p>I honour them as my parent and with no regrats with supporting them all the way. In contrast, naither do i have any options.</p>
              <p>As for the future solution, my gf is a japanese and she deeply understand the constraint that i'm facing here in sg. We are planning a a new head start somewhere perhaps to residing in Japan or other places that are more humanity.</p>

              <p>But generally the south of anywhere away from the major city area are affordable. Geographically, the more people in a city, the more activities and the faster the pace means more expensive it get and as a result the mindset does affacted and become very compatitive individual. Unfortunately here in sg, we're all surrounded by sea water and these no where to run.. kinda scary indeed..</p>
