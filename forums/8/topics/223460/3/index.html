Three weeks ago, he broke up with his China girlfriend - of 13 days.<br><br>'Sometimes, love cannot be calculated by days,' the 30-year-old tells you in all seriousness, going on to extol the beauty of girls from China.<br><br>'Their features are so nice and they have perfect skin.'<br><br>That's not to say that he is in want of female attention here, says the showbiz wannabe whom many remember for his singularly bizarre act of stripping down to his yellow swimming trunks while auditioning for Singapore Idol two years ago.<br><br>If you missed that, you can still catch him making his moves in a video clip on his website (www.stevenlim.net), which has him describing himself as 'Singapore's and the US' most handsome guy'. In the clip, the Nanyang Polytechnic graduate is dressed in - what else - just his briefs.<br><br>Believe it or not, fame is no longer a priority with him these days.<br><br>'Last time, I would die to attain fame. Now I know what it is like to get recognised on the street.<br><br>'Of course I want more fame, but what's important to me now is money. I just want to be rich and happy and to retire early,' he says.<br><br>Apart from working as an eyebrow stylist - he is regularly spotted along Orchard Road promoting his services - he gets called upon to perform or be an emcee at private functions. He has also appeared on some Mandarin variety programmes.<br><br>Still, deliberate or otherwise, he cannot quite stay out of the public eye. A recent YouTube video he put up, for instance, has him ranting in a heated monologue against Project Superstar II contestant Averil Chan.<br><br>In an interview, she had referred to one eyebrow plucker who had run up to her at a mall and gushed over her, an incident which Lim claims was exaggerated.<br><br>But why the need to get all worked up, especially since no names were mentioned?<br><br>'Of course, (it's obvious). For example, if you say PM Singapore, who doesn't know?'<br><br><strong>Q</strong> You call yourself Singapore's famous hunky star. But where are the six-pack abs?<br><br><strong>A</strong> Seriously, I have a lot of people telling me that I am macho, good looking, and calling me a star. A lot of people, I mean really a lot of people, know who I am and request to have a picture taken with me. Six-pack abs? I counted them yesterday just before I went to bed. You mean they are gone? Look closely please!<br><br><strong>Q</strong> Stripping down to your trunks and underwear seems to be second nature to you. Ever thought of investing in a pair of Calvin Kleins though?<br><br><strong>A</strong> To clarify, I do not always like to strip. Before every act, I will consider carefully whether to strip again.<br><br>I don't go for branded goods. I go for design and durability. My current collection of underwear is both comfortable and affordable. During a recent visit to Taiwan, I ran out of sleeping shorts and just slept in my briefs. I had a good night's sleep.<br><br><strong>Q</strong> If you could play a famous Hollywood character, who would it be and why?<br><br><strong>A</strong> I would like to play the character 'Death' by Brad Pitt in the movie Meet Joe Black. I remember watching it with my first girlfriend who kept saying how good- looking and charming Brad was in the show. If there is a next life, I want to be more handsome and hotter than Brad. I want everyone to like me, and envy me for my many friends. I am a very lonely guy. I have many acquaintances but I don't have any true friends who really understand me. Boo hoo...<br>..<br>.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Q</strong> You once said that you were more handsome than Pierre Png. Err, are we talking about the same suave and gorgeous TV actor?<br><br><strong>A</strong> Did I say that? If I did, I must take those words back. But people do say I look like Pierre, and I even told him that one time when we acted together.<br><br>He is a nice guy. He just said 'Is it?'', laughed a bit, and took a picture with me using his cellphone.<br><br>I think he is a lot more handsome. But I'm just trying to be nice by saying that...trust me.<br><br><strong>Q</strong> Please explain the difference between fame and infamy.<br><br><strong>A</strong> Technically speaking, they are the same. Both mean that you are well known.<br><br>But fame means a lot of people know you and like what you are doing. Infamy means a lot of people know you but hate what you are doing.<br><br>Which one describes what I have? I have a lot of anti-Steven haters, but I also have a lot of pro-Steven supporters. My MSN has exploded with people who want to include me as their friend every day, ever since I announced I was looking for a girlfriend on my website. They post remarks such as 'Steven, you are cool, you are hot'. But of course, I have some that say 'Steven, go and die lah'. Hahaha...it's a harsh world, you can't please everyone.<br><br><strong>Q</strong> You used to be skinny but have bulked up, lost the geeky glasses and now sport a funky hairdo. Any plans to do anything even more drastic to improve the way you look?<br><br><strong>A</strong> Yah...I hate being skinny and geeky! I was like that before 2003 and I couldn't even bear to look at myself in the mirror then.<br><br>I am considering plastic surgery for parts of my body but I will not tell you where.<br><br>I also want to be taller. I am only 1.8m tall. I want to be 1.9m tall so everyone will look at me even if I am no longer famous one day.<br><br><strong>Q</strong> Please complete this sentence. 'The problem with being good-looking is...'<br><br><strong>A</strong> Is this a trick question to make me admit that I am good-looking? Well, you have it...I am good looking and I have got a good body, haha!<br><br>There is really no big problem with being gorgeous. I like it when people say that I am handsome. But maybe the problem arises when girls actually like you and are making their moves on you but they are not your type. You have to be tactful and use the right excuses to turn them down. Sometimes, I feel bad doing that but, seriously, they are very lucky because I am not as good as they think.<br><br><strong>Q</strong> You're looking for love. Why not go to a dating agency?<br><br>A Haha...Because I don't need a dating agency. There are girls coming up to me, but it just happens that I have not met the right one. I feel that I am getting old.<br><br>Just a bit of self-promotion: I make a very good lover, a very good friend, although I think I may not make a very good husband. So sad. Sometimes, I treat friends way better than my girlfriends.</div>
