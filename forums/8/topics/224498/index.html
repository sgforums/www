            <div class='col-md body'>For all people who take shuttle buses to and from IMM, pls take awhile to listen to my story here.<br><br>About an hour ago at around 9.30pm, i took the shuttle bus from IMM to JE MRT. Just as we were reaching ( at the pedestrian crossing near the back door of JE popular), there was a blangala (i presume) cycling cross the pedestrian crossing. The bus driver saw him ( I know cos i saw the driver wave to the cyclist) but to my horror just drove straight through without any signs of stopping.<br><br>A few seconds later, a female passenger let out a sharp scream and the next thing i know, all the standing passengers were thrown forward. To my relief, the cyclist was unhurt but the driver acted like the cyclist was in the wrong. He even gestured angrily towards the cyclist.<br><br>The incident left me shaken as god knows what would happen if the driver had not e-braked in time. Any1 knows where i can report this incident?<br>Btw, the bus number is PA 177D and the driver is a plumb chinese guy with a pot belly who looks in his late 40s.</div>
