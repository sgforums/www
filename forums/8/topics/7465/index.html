            <div class='col-md body'>I expected this to happen with u all sayin that u all do not know who Mike is and not giving a fuck abt it. Well thats the problem with SG radio stations, playing crap 90% of the time. If u want to check out to some gd music, check out Mike's band, Dream Theater or his side projects, Liquid Tension Experiment and TransAtlantic.<br>Btw LTE can be found at HMV, even though I personally like LTE 1, I must say LTE2 definately has more crazy and awesome technical shit! Sadly though its official that there will be no more LTE albums as Rudess is already with DT(Mike said it himself yesterday).<br>Well not everyone needs to know Mike but y does everyone knows those crappy boybands and shits?? Those guys shld be ashamed of themselves, only concerning themselves with making lots of money. Also by not playing music doesnt mean one cant appreciate gd music.<br><br>Peace,<br>SpookyKid<br><br>Love is the Dance of Eternity</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When Illegal Operation was younger.. he used to think that Ozzy Osbourne is the best vocal. Then when he got deeper into it Metal, Glen Benton (of Deicide) was the best vocal in the world. And he thought Slash was the best guitarist... and .. he writes NKOTB (or New Kids on the block) SUCKS! all over the school's desk...<br><br>Now, he looked back to those wild days... and couldn't help laughing at himself. Eventually he got over these. He exposed himself more to the different gernes of music, and realized that for years, he has lived in his well. Mike Portnoy might be a good drummer. In the hard rock/heavy metal gerne .. perhaps. And that's about all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I dont know how this thread can suddenly becomes like this. Originally I thought there would be others who did went to the clinic, well I thought wrong then.<br>Just to make things clear, I am not a 14-15 yr old prick who idolises one thing and dont give a care abt the rest. Illegal Operation, I've been through that stage too. I also used to think that Slash was the best guitarist and stuff until I went "deeper" into the scene. Now I think that Vai, Malmsteen, Gilbert,Petrucci etc... is much better in him. Technically and creatively. The reason I held my stand that Portnoy is the best drummer in the world is because after seeing his drum clinic it certainly proved that he is the best. I had great admiration for Buddy Rich, Dennis Chambers, Jimmy Chamberlain, Manukachi and even Yoshiki and I think these r one of the best drummers in the world but Portnoy proved to me that he was a cut abv these guys. He was an All-in-One guy.<br>I'm not trying to force anybody to like Portnoy, DT or watever. I'm just saying that u guys shld check him and his band out. Its like a CD reviewer giving a HIGHLY RECOMMENDED rating to a particular album. If u dont like it then treat it as a bad review, if u like it well theres more variety to ur CD collection.

            <div class='col-md body'>Boybands do not compare to Dream Theatre. This is because they are of a different gerne altogether. Its fine to compare one boyband to another and claim that one suck because it is fair. To compare boyzone to dream theatre is like comparing my laksa to my neighbour's popiah.. yup.<br><br>No drummer is the best in the world. Steve Vai might be a great guitarist in the rock scene.. its wierd to compare Vai to Wes Montgomery (jazz guitarist..supposingly the best in jazz) because they play different style ultimately.<br><br>Anyway, Illegal Operation's a drummer himself. He plays fusion.... loves syncopation. Performs orgasimically when playing with a cool bassist. Idol's Akira Jimbo, former drummer of Casiopea..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Since when did I ever made a comparison between Boybands and Dream Theater[its ER not RE  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">]?? The reason I said Boybands sux is because they r! They r nothin but products of those shrewd marketing ppl. They know looks sells so y not throw in a bunch of guys who looks gd and who can sing and dance here and there. Get some real catchy tunes and not forgetting a few ballads too. And "hey presto" u got urself a million dollars. OK to be fair then, I'll compare Boybands of today with Boybands of yesteryears lets say, Westlife and early Beatles. OK both have millions of woman fans screaming for them and played popular music. Hmm.. thats abt it rite? Beatles wrote their own songs and played their own instruments(and well too I might add). What abt Westlife?? They r totally depended on other songwriters and also the only instrument that they play is their vocal chords. Whats more they do covers crappily too. To my opinion the only Boyband that was ever talented and could at least emulate some success of the Beatles was Take That. Too bad they had enough of each other and decided to call it quits.<br>Anyway maybe is true by saying that theres no best of something in the world as one day u will find someone better than u. However diff genres of music doesnt necessarily mean that we cant make comparison out of them. Ok lets us say that Vai plays rock and Wes Montgomery plays jazz. Common instrument, guitar. The question is now can Vai play something like Montgomery or can Montgomery play something like Vai or can both of them play well let us say a totally diff music altogether?? If one of them can do those things and one of them cant doest that make the one who can a better guitarist than the other. So who says u cant compare between musicians playing diff genre of music? One day there will be someone who can better Portnoy but for now he's by far the best. During the clinic, he was playing all the diff kinds of music possible, jazz, samba, rock, metal, pop, etc.. and he played them very well I must add!<br>Its cool to see a drummer in here. I would I like to know if that do u know Portnoy or u knew him frm here?? During the clinic, I saw Kenny Hogan(whom I feel is one of the best SG drummers ard) and that bald black guy, Blair something. They were certainly in awe during the clinic. OK, looks like this thread has turn into something quite nasty.<br><br>Peace,<br>SpookyKid<br><br>Love is the Dance of Eternity</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A band is a group of people who come together to make music through the use of vocals and instruments.  So, why are some of today's boy groups known as bands?  They don't play any instruments or make music, in that sense of the word.  However, they are awfully good at putting on pained expressions when singing about lost loves.<br>Is there such a thing as man bands to define grown-up boys who make music?</div>
