I look nerdy and weak at that time,you see.<br><br>I pwned the fu-cker with 3 classic sucker punches.I still remember nutmegging him to score the opening goal.The loser had no place to hide his face...<br><br>So,I won the game 3-0.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lol, i'm pretty sure what I did when i was young was experienced by many of you people. Like firstly, some kids and in my block and others will meet up, and guess what? We would play block-catching. Everytime we play we would like choose a different block, so that the catcher would not know the hiding places since we change the block everytime. I remembered that once, i was being pursued eagerly by the catcher, so i hid at my neighbours door as they have this wall to prevent anyone from being seen. Good times..good times..<br><br>Another thing we used to do is to go all the way to the top storey of the block, then started knocking on every single door and just ran away laughing like some damn maniacs. Some housewives or people sleeping would open the door and curse at us as we ran away. The good thing? we never get caught or reported before, so we kept on doing that till we gets old and realise we have our own lives to handle.<br><br>Nowdays, kids are damn shitty. All of them doesnt play this kinda games anymore. With the technology, all they do is ONLINE GAMING. Dota, warfaraft, maple, you named it, they know how to play it. Agree? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
