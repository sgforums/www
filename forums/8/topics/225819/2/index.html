            <div class='col-md body'>Lol yeah, like what TYING and sand king said, all the eraser stuff were really hot in my pri school days. About putting stapler bullets into the eraser, I remembered having this friend who has a whole pencil case full of those stapler bullet easers just to "battle" with other people. He told me the reason for having so many different erasers because the bullets were stapled differently for different grounds(tables, cement floor etc) so thinking back, it was really lame. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>And the one about the country rubber, we did play that tons of time too. At that time, alot of boys would use brazil and england, maybe cause they are pretty famous by that time, and 2 person would play the game by trying to use only their thumb to turn and turn the eraser till it sort of cover the opponent eraser to win, same old Good times.. good times... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
