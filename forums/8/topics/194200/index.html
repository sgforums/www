Seriously people in those position are not looking at $ but more on childcare, mobility, lifestyles etc.<br><br>Like they say, different strokes for different folks, plus yes the threat of losing the position in the company is very real. I don't see that group of people having kids unless companies are more pro-family. Just the government wanting is not enough.</div>
