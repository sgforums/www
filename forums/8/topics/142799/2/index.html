            <div class='col-md body'>Well, to answer your questions, most polytechnics have rules preventing guys from having long hair but usually you'd see guys with long hair going about the campus without any problems whatsoever. It all depends on 1, the polytechnic you go to and 2, whether your school(Life sci/engineering/etc) discipline master is strict about it or not. As for crossdressing, I'm not sure, I suppose if you could pull yourself off as a female, there wouldn't be any foreseeable problems except of course, the usual ones, toilets, etc. Also note that the lecturers and other students might not take too kindly to this though. Otherwise, I guess you could just dress adrogynously or something. Don't take my word on this though.<br><br>As for hormones, how'd you get them? I heard they're prescription drugs...<br><br></div>

I doubt many staff may notice it during normal days.<br><br>About which toilet I'm to use, well, theres a problem. Cause when I'm dressing up like a girl, I'd be wearing more girlish clothes that shows my femme body parts.
