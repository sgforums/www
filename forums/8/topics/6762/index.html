            <div class='col-md body'>Errr, get a place in what?<br><br>ANywayz, I dun like informatics. It is a crap school out to suck $$$. I once signed up for a dipolma course for it and was put off by the bad experience I had with informatics.<br>Firstly, the lectures were slow. Its slow to a point where I IRC in the lecture room. I can't even be bothered to listen to the lecturer. Maybe I am accustomed to being in the same level of ppl when I am studying. But I just cant stand how "stupid" those ppl seem to me. A simple problem can be talked upon for more than half an hour.<br>Secondly, the lecturers are not up to date. Ok, not all but most if them. Even I, a student in Infomatics is better than the damn lecturer talking rubbish infront. A simple process of bolding, italicsing and mixing up the different type of fonts can take up to half a lesson. Oh, how efficent is informatics. And how money smart are them. They are just money suckers. You can learn all those computer skills by yourself. The only bad thing is that you do not have a certificate.<br>Hmmm...think I went out of point...<br><br>------------------<br>The Prince Of Death...<br>______________<br>| |Ã” NiVleK Ã” | |</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To be frank with you, Inf*****ics is not very recognised in Singapore, cos it is not good enuff.<br><br>It is alright if it is used for short term re-training of employees. But for a diploma .... not a good idea.<br><br>I went for 3 courses in Inf*****ics before. All were short-term crash courses (each last only 1 week) and to be frank, they were really lousy. The lecturers never bothered to explain in depth.<br><br>For example, when i took up Javascript and C++, the lecturer just taught us the various syntax but never explains in depth. You ended up just like a technician who just "go through motion" but dun really understand the process thoroughly. After that, i took up the same subject in a local tertiary institution and discovered the GREAT differences. Besides the poor teaching skills, they are also not very effective and efficient .... they had actually lost my 500+ pages project in UK !!<br><br>Well, if you are really good and talented, then you got to prove it. Dun expect the government to protect you like a flower in the greenhouse. This is true to everybody, not only you.<br><br>Life is hard, who says it has to be easy anyway ?</div>
