              <p><em><strong>MELBOURNE (AFP) — About 200 Australian police broke up a sit-in
                  protest against violent attacks on Indian students, detaining 18 and
                  drawing accusations of excessive force.<br><br>Trouble flared when
                  police moved in to clear the protest in Melbourne's city centre before
                  the morning rush hour, punching and dragging away individual
                  protesters, according to activists.<br><br>Several hundred students
                  protested overnight to draw attention to "curry bashings" -- alleged
                  racial violence against Indians which has left one victim in a coma and
                  strained relations with New Delhi.</strong><br><br>"There was definitely an amount of excessive force by Victoria police," protester Yogesh Malhotra told ABC radio.<br><br>"Six (police) to one guy who was sitting down peacefully, who was punched and dragged."<br><br>Victoria
                  police commissioner Simon Overland said using force was justified
                  because the protesters had ignored a final order to leave a busy street.<br><br>"There were blows, as I said because arms had been linked, and there was a lot of resistance going on," he told reporters.<br><br>"If
                  someone inadvertently got hit in the mouth and got injured I regret
                  that, but that came about on the part of the actions of the
                  demonstrators after they'd been given every opportunity to leave the
                  area."<br><br><strong>The students were demanding action after more than 70
                  assaults on their peers in a year in Melbourne, including at least four
                  in the past fortnight, attracting prominent coverage in newspapers here
                  and in India.<br><br>The issue has tested diplomatic ties between
                  Canberra and New Delhi, as well as leading to Australia being labelled
                  racist in the Indian media, which coined the term "curry bashings."<br><br>Police
                  say that 30 percent of assaults in Melbourne's western suburbs are
                  against Indians, a grossly disproportionate figure in a city of almost
                  four million with an Indian student population of less than 50,000.</strong><br><br>But
                  they deny any racial element to the attacks, arguing Indian students
                  are often simply in the wrong place at the wrong time as they travel
                  home late with items such as mobile phones and MP3 players.</em></p>
