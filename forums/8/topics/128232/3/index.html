            <div class='col-md body'>Ok i'm starting to get most point of views from you guys ard.<br><br>People who post reply in this topic are the following below:<br><br>1) People who really hates the opp race due to their attitude,behaviour...etc<br><br>2) People who are hardcore ANTI RACIST dudes. Claiming to be Singaporean and thus should be tolerant n stuff.<br><br>3) People who dun dare to say that they hate the opp race and try to act anti racist. If u r one who say in your whole darn life u never seen an opp race that makes u hate him/her alot u r so darn Mountain Turtle. Cos i strongly disagree with that statement becos they r always around us.<br><br>Im a chinese here and i do hate chinese if i ever see them acting like a A** in front of me or anywhere near my sight. I've seen this group of boys in Queensway Shopping centre who went into the same sports shop as me. They are making alot of noise and speaks lots of vulgarities. The shopkeeper too cant stand them and this is what he said. " Wah those boys ah talk like radio non stop and so loud." Another aunty shopkeeper said : " Ya la, so rude,mouth full of vulgarities no manners."<br><br>Similarly, i share the same point of view as them. The moment they step in,i hate them lots. Do you guys experience the same?<br><br>Another one which is typical. Malay girls always dress darn skimpy expecially in their school uniform. Short short skirt and walk like ermmm ah lian?<br>Im sure you can see them around your neighbourhood. Girls as young as Upper Pri already start to be like this. I find them quite Slu** in this way. I mean if your daughter is like this can u stand it?<br><br>Immitation Goods is a common sight on malays. Especially youngsters.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>U think that my topic smells of racism. Thats the angle u r looking at it.<br><br>We have our views n opinion to the question. And MOST of us share the same thing. It not abt minority but majority. Its something so annoying that we have to ask our self why is it this way. When i thought im alone facing this prob actually im not. Ask your father if he ever had this prob with the other race. Im so sure he will say he have face it b4. And sometimes it really reach the max limit of toleration in one person. But Singaporean r Singaporean. We tolerate and will never go out there and challenge them face to face. I didnt thought that this problem is so severe until frens ard mi is bringing up this matter.<br><br>We wont have any problem if u dun cause any problem. Who dun wan peace right? Dragg leave us alone to talk abt this issue and stop being an irritant.<br></div>
