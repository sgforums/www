              <p>Hi there, firstly, I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this thread, if it is not please move the thread for me and I apologise in advance.</p>
              <p>So here's my story: I have someone from Korea who will be settling down in Singapore. She's currently 28 years old and holds a degree in Design (from some Korea university). She will be graduating from a Japan arts school this coming March.</p>
              <p>So my questions are: </p>
              <p>1) Are there any trustworthy Korean based companies in Singapore that are in the Design field? I understand that she can pick up English (which she is already doing) and join any English-based companies. However, as a minority in Singapore, I suppose it will be more comfortable for her. Afterall, she will be settling down. </p>
              <p>The pay is not an issue as she can always take up a part-time job as a translator or a Korean tutor. Since she majors in Design, it's best that she does what she's good at right?</p>
              <p>2) I've looked up several websites of the Korean community in Singapore (KoreaTown, SingaporeKorean), however, according to her (sites are in Korean), they are either outdated (2005) or are just plainly spam. Therefore my question is, are there any updated websites which the Korean community in Singapore possibly turn to? (Such as forums.) These can also be websites that provide help for them on visa issues and such.</p>
              <p>I also understand that there are some Singapore organizations that can render help to her, however to be honest, I would prefer Korean organizations because afterall, they should be more willing and understanding of her situation.</p>
              <p>3) Are there any active Korean organizations in Singapore that supports them? As in, providing help to these Singapore Koreans and organizing activites (like gatherings during Korea festivals, holidays, etc)?</p>
              <p>Finally, thank you for taking the time out to read this thread. I also understand that it might not be convenient to post urls to other forums/websites, therefore, I would gladly welcome you to pm me as well.</p>
              <p>Any help will be appreciated. Thank you and have a nice day.</p>
