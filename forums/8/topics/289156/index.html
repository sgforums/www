            <div class='col-md body'>SAN DIEGO -- The benefits of flying first class are clear -- bigger seats, more leg room and food.<br><br>The biggest drawback may seem clear, too -- the price.<br><br>So, how would you like to sit in the front but pay less than someone way in the back?<br><br>Krista Rosenberg said she always tries to fly first class.<br><br>"Having a more comfortable seat, getting on the plane faster, getting off the plane faster -- anything to make it more easy is nice," said Rosenberg.<br><br>But she said flying up front is sometimes too pricey -- that is until Rosenberg uncovered a first class secret.<br><br>"I was getting to pay the same amount as someone in coach, or maybe a little bit more, but at the same time, I was able to fly in first class," Rosenberg.<br><br>What's the travel trick? While booking a flight, ask the agent about a special type of fare. It's most commonly called a YUPP. But some airlines also use codes like QUPP and Z.<br><br>"I think most travelers do not realize that these fares are out there," said Matthew Bennett with FirstClassFlyer.com.<br><br>The leading airlines all confirmed they offer this kind of fare, describing it as either a coach seat with an automatic upgrade or deeply discounted first class.<br><br>Bennett said it can amount to some big bargains.<br><br>"Full-first class can be double or more what a YUPP fare can be," said Bennett.<br><br>Rick Seaney, president of FareCompare, helped 10News see how the deals work.<br><br>For a round trip flight from Dallas to St. Louis on American Airlines, the YUPP fare is $278 -- that's nearly $1,500 cheaper than a regular seat in first class and more than a $1,000 less than the most expensive seat in coach.<br><br>"A lot of times the YUPPs are matching some sort of low-cost carrier in a particular market," said Seaney.<br><br>On a round trip Delta flight from Baltimore to Atlanta the QUPP fare was $638 -- that's $750 less than regular first class and nearly half the price of full-fare coach. That's a surprise to traveler Bill Griffith, who rarely flies up front.<br><br>"I had no idea you could actually find a reasonably priced first-class ticket," said Griffith.<br><br>Experts said it's easy. Ask a booking agent on the phone specifically for a YUPP, or if you buy online, all you have to do is search for a first-class seat. If a YUPP is available, the fare will automatically show up as the lowest rate. You can confirm that by checking the fare class.<br><br>"I would never have thought of even trying to go first class," said Griffith.<br><br>Once the flyer knew how to look, he found a YUPP in just minutes.<br><br>"My days of flying coach may be over," said Griffith.<br><br>In addition to sitting in the front of the plane, the YUPP seats offer even more benefits.<br><br>Experts said they're generally fully refundable seats, and you may get extra frequent flier miles for being in first.<br><br>not sure if Singapore Airline have anot..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
