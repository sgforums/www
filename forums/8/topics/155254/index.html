            <div class='col-md body'>If he's that poor, tell him to stop buying all those bikini to wear and shoot. And also sell his  camera phones to stop taking lousy pics of himself in those bikini to frighten little kids on the net.<br><br>And dont make it sound as if everyone who carries some branded stuff is rich. Some people actually save up for them. Others like me don't won brands and I eat colleague's dinner leftovers for lunch. So its free. Hence don't come and talk about dare or not. If you dare to ask colleagues for their dinner left overs, anything is possible.</div>
