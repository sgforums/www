BTW, some hawkers own race horses in turf club. Its not cheap to put up a horse esp in sg.<br><br>Some hawkers over charge and are dishonest and exercise unfair treatment of the customers... but so do restuarants and most places. How does one get back at these unfair hawkers is not to confront these people directly cause they will surely retailate. Its not boycott them .. if if people can.. then they can tell as many people as well..<br><br>To me life is just an acting game. Some people work hard to get a mercz and others eye green. Some people are given S class and others say they are rich what. All these are made up by humans what should and what should not...  all these are so artificial...<br></div>

How does one get back at these unfair hawkers is not to confront these people directly cause they will surely retailate. Its simply boycott them .. if if people can.. then they can tell as many people as well..<br><br>To me life is just an acting game. Some people work hard to get a mercz and others eye green. Some people are given S class and others say they are rich what.

Life is just an acting game.. everyone putting on a false front...<br><br>Btw.. if u feel offended by the hawkers.. just dun buy from him.. what for agrue with him.. and be serve with the food.. u never know what he gonna do to your food...</div>
