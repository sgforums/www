            <div class='col-md body'>There was once someone asked me, your God claimed to be the ONLY way to heaven and salvation, can you prove it to me?<br><br>I asked him "How do you want me to prove it to you?"  "What would it take to convince you?"<br><br>He said "Show me Jesus and ask him talk to me, then maybe I believe."<br><br>I replied "Then just too bad, I cant."<br><br>"Then how to believe if cant let me see."<br><br>TO that I told him "I cant see your brains too right now, but i sure believe you have one."<br><br>If you all think it is a story, it is not. I did say this to someone I met and started talking about Christianity.  In any case, the discussion ended nicely and the last part was not a dig at him but to show him that that there are many things in life we believe in but yet cant show concrete evidence for.<br><br>I believe many of you are pissed not because of Christian beliefs because about every other religion advocate that theirs are divine. Even muslims stipulate that conversion is necessary for cross-religion marriage, isnt it? I believe you are all pissed because the way you perceived christians being arrogant when they stand out there on the streets and proclaimed their God as real which implies that yours arent.<br><br>Yes, some christians are arrogant, they are insensitive, bad to the core, even worse then some non christians, deserve to be hang....but wait, is it God's fault then?  Can I blame Allah for a muslim's wrongdoing? Can I blame Buddha if a buddhist commits a crime? Can I blame Tua Pek Kong if a taoist swears at me?  So now, can I blame Jesus if a christian keeps irritating me with his preaching?  The question here is not even "Can I?", Its about "Should I.".<br><br>Jesus, Allah, Buddha or whoever you may believe as God, are unseen. I cant show you Jesus as much as I would want to. I can only tell you what the bible says.  Yes, you are entitled to believe it as nonsense, thats your basic right, but yet it would be only logical to concede that what the bible says MAY BE the TRUTH.  It has to be this way because if you HATE people insisting on their religion as TRUTH, then you cant insist that your way of thinking is DEFINITELY RIGHT.  You would be contradicting yourself then.  Either way, you have to concede that Jesus POSSIBLY, MAYBE is the ONLY GOD.  Thats only fair isnt it?<br><br>Since there is a possibility that it could be the truth, why should we just sweep it away like this just because of other people?  As I say, I am sure you wouldnt think it is fair to blame my grandpa or grandma or ancestors if I were to irritate the hell of of you.<br><br>Whatever your beliefs are, God or not, freethinker or atheist, it is still a belief.  If a freethinker cant prove to me that freethinking is the right way, then it is logical to say that no one can right now can prove God physically.  Choose what you wanna believe, but there can only be ONE truth, whatever it may be.<br><br>I wun advocate christianity here, I dun believe in that. I believe that healthy discussions can take place without christians being too pushy (so christians, take note) and also non believers just interested taking a swipe at us christians.<br><br>Sometimes, other people can be wrong. But think, what if this time, it is you who is wrong?<br><br>Cheers. Give each other a chance and i believe this can still be a democratic discussion with space for differing and diverse views.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I always believe that the right way for Christians to preach to non-Christians is to do charity, instead of verbally say "Oh my brother/sister, believe in Him and you shall be saved" blah blah blah.  Look at the missionaries in the past centuries.  Didn't they open schools, orphanage, homes etc for the poor?  In fact, in some poor countries such as China in the past, churches used to give out clothes and food and raise funds for the poor.  When people see all that the Christian charity organisation are doing, they will somehow decide to find out more about the religion.<br><br>Same applies to other religions.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello,<br><br>Whether a Christian can marry a non-Christian goes down to choice. Any couple want to marry someone who shares the most intimate and important things together. In the case of a Chrsitian our faith is the most important. Thus finding a spouse with similar faith is very important.<br><br></div>

They rather argue about who is the anti-christ, the beasts and other things(as mentioned in Revelation), speculate the signs of end times and utter some human prophecies...etc. Instead, they should return back to the basics, preaching of the gospel...only the gospel can save souls..not how well Christians verbally attack other religions and  the like"</div>

It may not be what you want, but I will go ahead anyway.  Hope you get some answers from it.<br><br>We need to ask and answer two questions. First, what is evil? It is that which is against God. It is anything morally bad or wrong. It is injurious, depraved, wicked. Some acceptable examples might be murder, rape, stealing, lying, and cheating. Second, if we want God to stop evil do we want Him to stop all evil or just some of it? In other words, if just some of it then why? If He were to stop only part of the evil, then we would still be asking the question, "Why is there evil in the world?".<br><br>Let's suppose that someone was about to commit murder. God would have to stop him, maybe whisper in his ear, or if that didn't work do something a little more drastic like have something fall on him, or stop his heart, or make his hands suddenly fall off. Anyway, God would have to do something.<br><br>What if somebody wanted to steal? God would have to stop him too, right? Undoubtedly, God's imagination would permit a more practical method than I have suggested, but the end results would be the same.<br><br>What about lying? If someone were to tell a lie, then to be consistent wouldn't you want God right there to stop that person from lying? After all, He couldn't let any evil occur could He?<br><br>Let's take it a step further. Suppose someone thought something evil. Then, of course, God would have to step in and prevent him from thinking anything bad at all, right? The end result would be that God could not allow anyone to think freely. Since everyone thinks and no one thinks only pure thoughts, God would be pretty busy and we wouldn't be able to think. Anyway, at what point do we stop, at the murder level, stealing level, lying level, or thinking level? As your questions implies, if you want God to stop evil, you would have to be consistent and want Him to do it everywhere all the time, not just pick and choose. It wouldn't work.<br><br>Evil is in this world partly because we give it its place but ultimately because God, in His sovereignty, permits it and keeps it under His control.<br></div>
