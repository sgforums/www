'cos got lots and lots and lots of other evidence to refute their beliefs<br><br>Please read the following story and let me know what u think, ok?<br><br>let's say that in year 2040 got a mad scientist create a new species.  This species is quite f*cked up.  'cos the scientist lousy like sh*t.  He calls this new species "dumbf*cks".<br><br>He tells them:"u all don't f*ck around, ok?  otherwise I will f*ck u upside down"<br><br>so the scientist keeps them in a very nice place in his house.  gives them lots of food and water and medicine to keep them healthy.<br><br>But the dumbf*cks, being the way they are created, just like to f*ck around.<br><br>They f*ck up the place.<br><br>The mad scientist damn angry!<br>"f*ck u! dumb f*cks!  i will not take care of you anymore!  You can live and you can die and u can go f*ck yourselves, you f*ckers!"<br><br>The dumf*cks start to make a damn huge mess!  They kill each other and f*ck each other like nobody's business!<br><br>The scientist just watched on and did nothing most of the time.<br><br>ocassionally he would kill some  dumbf*cks, those that did not currfavour up to him.<br><br>sometimes he would help some dumbf*cks, 'cos they carry his b*lls.<br><br>One day, 'cos he got nothing to do, he made a clone of himself.  a mini-scientist.  a 'mini-me', and he sent it into the dumbf*cks enclosure<br><br>mini-me is of course better than the d*mbfucks, and being a nice guy, he helped the d*mfucks that curryfavor the original scientist a bit.<br><br>But the dumbf*cks, being the dumbf*ckers that they are, killed mini-me!<br><br>The scientist took the dead mini-me and revived it using advanved medicine.<br><br>He sian already.  so most of the time he leaves the dumbf*cks alone, but sometimes he will kill some of them, sometimes he will help those that brownnose him<br><br>May i know what do you think of the scientist?<br><br></div>
