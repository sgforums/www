            <div class='col-md body'>On the issue of impartiality:<br><br>Well, sometimes I wonder why people have no problems taking leaps of faith like believing that the chair they are going to sit on will hold them up and that various historical figures that have influenced them largely exist, but when it comes to Jesus, they demand absolute, complete, and total proof. If Jesus is in their view, no more important o the world then say, Winston Churchill or Nero, why approach him with such demanding vigour?<br><br>I propose this trap, how can we be completely and absolutely sure of anything? I can tell you that I have a sister, and present you with a lot of evidence to show you so, birth certs, pictures, and even place here before you, but you can never be completely sure that she exists, for you could say that she could just be part of an eleborate deception, a hoax.<br><br>The truth of the matter is, we cannot be abolutely sure of anything, we cannot be absolutely sure that the car we are in has good brakes, that the food we are about the eat is not poisioned, that our friends are really our friends, that our world is not just a Matrix (tm.). To function and go about our normal lives, we take thousands, if not millions of leaps of faith that our world will somehow hold together, for we cannot be completely sure, even if it is before our eyes and we can touch, taste, see and smell it.<br><br>No, seeing is not believing, it is hardly believing. As Smith said: Apperances can be decieving. The truth of the matter is, the basis of belief is ultimately faith. Faith, and not seeing, is believing. It takes faith to believe in anything, be it christianity, buddhism, or athiesm.<br><br>Henceforth, while there may be truth in accusing some christians as biased and closed-minded, many non-believers need to also note that in their smug potshots from their ivory towers, they may have fallen into the same trap they have accused their counterparts of having fallen into.<br><br>It is easy to camp out in our respective camps and lob bombs at each other from our own high grounds of understanding, but how many of us are willing to come down to the plain and engage each other on an equal, unbiased level? A level in which we tear and test our opponent's position and see if they hold truth, but at the same time subject our own positions to the same testing. Truth will be truth, and it will remain so no matter what the athiests may say, no matter what we Christians will say, and it is truth that we intend to explore here for any sort of good to come from this, not take swipes at each other for kicks and to falsely blooster our own flawed worldviews.<br><br>I directly challange people here to put down their arms and engage each other here on a level playing field. Explore truth as truth presents itself, and not what we want truth to be. Only then can we get anywhere here.<br><br>Discovering truth does not need to have all this war, it takes the foolish to fight, but the prudent to make good and bring forth meaingful results from this.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lets set the record straight first<br><br>First, we should all treat bibles and qurans and buddhists scriptures as history books. Tat is such supernatural events actually happened long long ago. When we believe in a religion, we must totally believed tat such event had happened in the past before. For christians and catholic, it means tat Adam and Eve really do exists, Noah Ark was really built and carried all the animals in the world etc etc.<br><br>WE SHOULD NOT, I repoeat SHOULD NOT believe in a religion for 3 reasons.<br><br>1) They do a lot of charity, they help a lot of people they help u etc. Why ? Because u r just being grateful to the religion. U think tat if it teaches people good, then it should be true. Wrong. If it teaches people good, it just meant tat tis religion is supported by the Gov or ruler of tat time. It just meant it is a good religion implemented so tat Gov can rules easier, not because it is the truth.<br><br>Why do u ever think tat whoever or watever tat creates us, creates everything will wanna do good things in the first place ? It may start off with something totally neutral like the big bang. It may be some twisted Devil creating human for entertainment or food. No one knows. Truth isn't fairy tales, where there will be a happy ending or morale to be taught at end of lessons. Truth may hurts and it may be plain scientific<br><br>2) U believe religion because they will help u. They help u go to heaven, they help u pass exams, they pick u up in your life etc. Why ? Because tat God doesn't deserve any respect because he isn't perfect, isn't fair and is egoistic.<br><br>Whenever I saw posters telling people they will gain eternal happiness or be "saved" if they turned to Him, I really wanna curse and swear since it just means tat God is unfair and only help people who soothes his ego. Can anyone blame Muslim to believe in Quran and Buddhists to believe in Buddhiism ? Do they not make sacrifice to the religion ?  They r all equally pious to their religion too isn't it ? Then why does God only shows favourism to Christians and not to Buddhist and Muslim. And why not to other people who don't believe in anything ? Why must we soothes his ego before he helps us ? Why does people who soothes his ego get special "priviledges", a direct passport to heaven while the others, being totally pious too had to suffer in hell over a decision tat wasn't clear to him ?<br><br>3) Because u feel close to the cell group, u like the people there. Why ?  Let me pose tis question, if these same group of people u are close with were Buddhists while all the people u meet in all the church (lets say u r a christian) r  plain assholes, will u start switching your religion ? I don't know, I believe tat people want to have a sense of belonging. Being in the same group makes u feel better, however it doesn't mean u r close to the truth.<br><br>With tis I will end my post here....</div>

Granted I agree that evil is too wide to be classified. What is evil to you then? Is there anything evil to you that may not be evil to a GOD, regardless whether Jesus or Allah or whoever you may believe in.  Evil is not something only the DEVIL does, evil just means something that is no good.  I am sure my definitions of evil does not fall too short of anyone else's definition of evil, agree? I think that cursing someone is evil. I think that spreading lies are evil.  I think that murder is evil.  I think that malicious gossips are evil.  I think that bearing grudges are not good.  I think that adultery is evil.  Do you think the same way as I do? Or do you think that what I tot as evil are actually good?<br><br>What is moral? A moral is a standard in everyone.  Would most people agree with me that rape is evil? Would most people agree with me that slandering is evil? Would most people agree with me that lying (and I am not going into the area of WHITE LIES) is bad?  Would most people agree with me that cursing someone and bearing hatred and grudges is bad?  I believe MOST people would say YES. That is moral.<br><br>I dun think anyone will flame you, this is not about flaming but about discussing.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">Lets set the record straight first<br><br>First, we should all treat bibles and qurans and buddhists scriptures as history books. Tat is such supernatural events actually happened long long ago. When we believe in a religion, we must totally believed tat such event had happened in the past before. For christians and catholic, it means tat Adam and Eve really do exists, Noah Ark was really built and carried all the animals in the world etc etc.<br><br>WE SHOULD NOT, I repoeat SHOULD NOT believe in a religion for 3 reasons.<br><br>1) They do a lot of charity, they help a lot of people they help u etc. Why ? Because u r just being grateful to the religion. U think tat if it teaches people good, then it should be true. Wrong. If it teaches people good, it just meant tat tis religion is supported by the Gov or ruler of tat time. It just meant it is a good religion implemented so tat Gov can rules easier, not because it is the truth.<br><br>Why do u ever think tat whoever or watever tat creates us, creates everything will wanna do good things in the first place ? It may start off with something totally neutral like the big bang. It may be some twisted Devil creating human for entertainment or food. No one knows. Truth isn't fairy tales, where there will be a happy ending or morale to be taught at end of lessons. Truth may hurts and it may be plain scientific<br><br>2) U believe religion because they will help u. They help u go to heaven, they help u pass exams, they pick u up in your life etc. Why ? Because tat God doesn't deserve any respect because he isn't perfect, isn't fair and is egoistic.<br><br>Whenever I saw posters telling people they will gain eternal happiness or be "saved" if they turned to Him, I really wanna curse and swear since it just means tat God is unfair and only help people who soothes his ego. Can anyone blame Muslim to believe in Quran and Buddhists to believe in Buddhiism ? Do they not make sacrifice to the religion ?  They r all equally pious to their religion too isn't it ? Then why does God only shows favourism to Christians and not to Buddhist and Muslim. And why not to other people who don't believe in anything ? Why must we soothes his ego before he helps us ? Why does people who soothes his ego get special "priviledges", a direct passport to heaven while the others, being totally pious too had to suffer in hell over a decision tat wasn't clear to him ?<br><br>3) Because u feel close to the cell group, u like the people there. Why ?  Let me pose tis question, if these same group of people u are close with were Buddhists while all the people u meet in all the church (lets say u r a christian) r  plain assholes, will u start switching your religion ? I don't know, I believe tat people want to have a sense of belonging. Being in the same group makes u feel better, however it doesn't mean u r close to the truth.<br><br>With tis I will end my post here....</div></blockquote>I agree. Look at the bible as a history book.<br><br>1.  As you said, NO ONE KNOWS. So why couldnt it be Jesus? It could be isnt it?  And since you say no one knows, why are you so sure then to say that religions do not contain truth (in the part about government)?  And like you said, NO ONE KNOWS. So if you says that religions are not worth getting into because you said ".......not because it is the truth.", then you must have seen EVERYTHING to be able to make this bold statement because NO ONE KNOWS!<br><br>PS: In any case, I dun worship a religion. I worship Jesus.  You ask me if I know everything. You ask me how can I prove to you that Jesus is God. I can tell you I do not know and I cant because NO ONE KNOWS.  Its not called a faith for nothing.<br><br>2.  A king will only reward those who are loyal to him...you do not really foresee a king giving his land away freely to traitors.  Anyway, this only applies if we are dealing exclusively with christianity.  THis is the christian's stand.  Islam's have their stands.  Buddhism has their stands.  And to questions like "It is unfair, this person never heard of Christ.  It is unfair, this person is unclear what Jesus is talking about.", I would ask "How do you know these people are unclear and never heard of Christ?"<br><br>3.  As I said, black sheeps are everywhere. I have assholes in my church.  I was and maybe still am to some people, an asshole. But I believe in Christ not the people.<br><br>This is not to hit back at you but just my opinion on what you have stated.<br><br></div>

Everyone's views about evil is different.  Thats why i used "MOST PEOPLE".  I am sure there are people who thinks that the 911 terrorists were good people. But what percentage is that? Again, I say, most of us would think it is evil.  And we think it is evil because the moral in us tells us that taking such extreme measures just because they wanna teach the US a lesson is simply evil.  As for God would think who is good or bad? No one knows because we are not God.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okie, at least now I know when have I started pissing u off...<br><br>First, u r right, we do make a lot of leap of faith. We sit on chairs, knowing tat they can hold us. We drive a car, knowing tat it will not malfunction suddenly. However why do we trust them ? Because we all had sat on chairs many times and they don't fail. Because we had drive a car many times and it works perfectly. We have done it so many times and it doesn't fail us, tat is why we got tis trust in them. Lets say there is a new product, a new drug untested and it was suppose to make u lose tons of weight. Will u take it ? Lets say there is a new vehicle just invented, again without undergoing rigorous testing, will u drive it ?<br><br>For historic facts, why do we believe them. First, they didn't tell stories tat was unbelievable. They told of acts tat can be accomplished by human and science. Second, there were many many proof and documents about their lives, thus if we do more research, we can find out more about them. Thirdly, for me personally I believe them only to a certain extent. History is written by the victor of war or Gov. If WWII Germany had won, we would have read a totally different history now. I do give doubts to history too. I do not believe tat Sanila Utama (don't know spelling) saw a lion when he landed in Singapore since lions live on Africa.<br><br>Wat about religion ? They tell of totally incredible supernatural things, totally unachievable by human and science now. (splitting of red sea) Why do one believe in such things so easily in the first place ? If u told me a man can fly on his arms, yet without offering me proof, I will not believe it. If a man can fly, and is verified by experts can be repeated many times for other to see it for themselves, I will believe in it. Thus tis is the same as religion. They r asking me to believe somethign incredible, yet cannot offer any proof, and its bibles offers flaws and contain illogicals, how do u expect one to believe in it ?<br><br>Actually, tis is not the first time people had use the "faith" thing. WHenever I argue about religion, they will definitely say "Faith" and appears to be high up and noble after tat.<br><br>To me, faith is belief in something despite a lack of evidence (or, in many cases, belief in spite of overwhelming evidence to the contrary). If one person can use faith to justify a belief, another person can use faith to justify a diametrically opposed belief. For example, faith provides no way of discerning who is correct when someone says that they have faith that God created the universe and someone else says that they have faith that the Invisible Pink Unicorn created the universe. Since it is clear that faith cannot be used to reliably justify any belief, we have to conclude that faith is irrational. In fact, in the entire history of human civilization, the only methods that we have been able to come up with for determining whether or not some claim is true are reason and objective experimentation that is repeatable, i.e., the scientific method.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well.. leap of faith is one thing.. there's a diff between blind faith and logical faith.<br><br>let me ask u smth.. look at your table. its made of wood yes? its got interesting useful design yes?<br><br>yet how can u compare that table with a tree? a living breathing thing, which respond to its surrounding, able to replace dead branches, and leaves produce air and so much more wonderful things than the table<br><br>if you believe that that table is made by someone, you obviously haven't seen in your life. is it so hard to believe, that the tree, which was made much more uniquely and is so much complicated, has also a designer?<br><br>many facts of this world. is linked to the bible's describtion..<br><br>basically, how much do you know about this world? 20%? 50%? let me give u, say u smart enuff. u know 70% of this world. what if. God is in the remaining 30%?<br><br>do you actually believe the earth is million of years old, when there are scientific findings that contractict this statement?<br><br>scientific findings that coincidentally aligns with the bible's timing? for example, the great flood of  noah we all heard about?<br><br>fossils and stuff, all supports the great flood theory. instead of the die, and million years of dust crush it to make a fossil.<br><br>there are still enough water in the form of ice, and other states, to completely flood the earth one more time<br><br>and korean vessel researches have detertmined that the ark of noah based on the bible's description of design, it is possible for it to float and withstand against strong currents and tidal waves and house living things.<br><br>in fact just using 1 event of the bible i can explain a great deal of things related to fossils and stuff. which definitely puts down the idea of 1000000000000 year old dust settling down and forming fossils. (of course i am not a scientist, he came 3 weeks ago teaching, and i did invite u guys, just that u all didn't respond) it was really a good talk. plus Q and A where u can whack him with your doubts. that was my fav part.<br><br>describtion of dinosaurs and findings of red blood cells on supposedly million of years old fossils, which is impossible.<br><br>how many times scientists have made silly mistakes to claim that certain species were certain to die out due to the "million of years" to find them thriving somewhere else. and label them as living fossils.<br><br>hell, we wouldn't hv survived if there is a screw up in oxygen or carbon dioxide, its so pin point precise.<br><br>and what? years ago, people believed the world was flat? when its already documented that the earth is round.<br><br>is it so hard to believe earth may not be that old? its actually give or take 60 000 years old? and not million of years?<br><br>is it so hard to believe there is a God?<br><br>believing whether there is a God, isn't the issue. the evidence is around all of us..<br><br>heck there are 64 for books in the bible. a good few thousand years apart from the first book to the last book. every book speaks of Jesus Christ, the writers have no idea who the other writers are, yet, every book speaks of Jesus' coming, what He plans to do, and how is He gonna do it, the first book talks abt the last book, and the last book talks about the first book.<br><br>but knowing the real one. thats the piss off.</div>

However it can be Guan Yin or some deity from Taoist too. How do we verify then ? The best way is to go through their stories, or wat they claimed and find out whether does it makes sense or not.

I just leave some questions here<br><br>1) Do u believe in evolution ?<br><br>2) Does the bible say God is perfect ? How do u define perfect.<br><br>For second point, I got to ask u again. U have a pet dog, and u love him dearly. U ask the dog to speak in human language, can the dog do tat ? Of course not, and so we shouldn't punish the dog for tat isn't it ?

Is he any better than other religions ?<br><br>A buddhist can phrase it "U have heard about Buddha and u chose not to believe in it, tat is why u r not been treated fairly"<br><br>A Muslim can say " U have heard about Allah and u refuse to believe in it, tat is why u r not been treated fairly"<br><br>A Hindau can say " U have heard about  and u chose not to believe it, tat is why u r not been treated fairly"<br><br>(apologies to these religions, I just use them as a reference)<br><br>Goodness ! So watever I choose, I will incur the wrath of the other religions ! And I am still clueless which is correct !<br><br>Frankly, I know of buddhism and they don't condemn people if they believe or not believe in their religion. Tat should be the fair way since we all r clueless on which religion to choose ! For christian, they practise "favourtism". To me, offering such carrots as a reward already seems to have deviate from the truth, the truth of wat happened in the past.<br><br>For your last point, Point number 3 written by me before is not applicable in your sense. However it is to other people who join because of the company. I personally know people joined Christian knowing nuts about Jesus Christ and bible.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>no i don't believe in evolution. what is perfect? i'm sure you know what perfect means. the word itself describes it. in a way no words can better substitute it.<br><br>and i don't agree that if ppl aren't christian, they aren't blessed. the way i see it. its the other way round.<br><br>and yes. we don't have excuse not to make a clear decision.<br><br>there is an island, near off coast of new gunea, above australia i think. the island is seldom set foot upon due to cannabalism and stuff. there were 2 missionaries, who spent over 20 years on the island. the tribal people there, didn't have their own written language. only speech of clicks and noise. sounds.<br><br>so the missionaries started of by designing their own written language<br><br>anyway that isn't the point<br><br>the point is. the missionaries one of them, asked a kid, do you have any laws in here? the kid said yes, there are a few, the missionaries ask, oh? what are they? the kid said, you cannot kill other ppl. you cannot steal, you must respect your elders, cannot lie blah blah.<br><br>and i make these reference to the 10 commandments. thou shall not kill, thou shall steal, honour your father and mother, thou shall not bear false witness against your neighbour. blah blah.<br><br>these ppl. don't even have a written form of language. knew these laws. and it is so coincident, that it is written in the bible, that the laws of God is written in the heart of all men, so that none have any excuse.<br><br>God don't prove He is around? read the post above. take a trip to jerusalem and see the historical sites where Jesus had been, take a look at the place where He is buried. trust me, if you choose to ignore facts, seeing doesn't mean beliveving, when Jesus walked among men, not everyone believed, the jewish rabbis crucified Him. as foretold in the bible in the old testiment, the latest one would be a near 500 years difference from the last book of the old testament to the first book of the new testament<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>firstly i think you have misunderstood some things..<br><br>we incur the wrath of God not because we don't follow him, well. technically, but more accurately, its because we are sinners, we do wrong things, which get screwed up endings, which screws up other ppl's lives which in turn screws up your life. and vice versa. tts the effects of sins.<br><br>sin is present in this world, look around u, so many questions in morality, nowadays.<br><br>Jesus Christ came to get his butt kicked to remove the pentalty of sins above our head.<br><br>thats the main message. i think that "if u dun follow, u gonna get cancer 2molo" bull is your own fanciful idea. pls keep your story straight.<br><br>the main christian message has basically 4 parts.<br>firstly,<br>point 1 - God loves us sorry ass humans, and has a great destiny for us, we are suppose to be with Him enjoying life staring at the sun set. blah blah, so why are we suffering here?<br><br>point 2 - cuz we hv sinned against God, which is totally adam and eve's fault, but sin is passed down thru the blood line, which is why Jesus had the miracle birth.  if u notice our blood type is determined by the blood type of the father. not the mum. anyway, the penalty of sin is death. but God knows this sin isn't exactly our fault, and He still loves us, its all satan's fault, and God is going to kick his sorry ass later.<br><br>point 3 -  what to do? man already sin, and God did say sin = death. death must still occur, cuz He isn't wishy washy. but He doesn't want us to die, so Jesus died in our place instead, to wash away the past, present and future sins<br><br>point 4 - since Jesus died more than 2000 years ago, why are we still feeling screwed up? thats cause though Jesus did die for the sins of man kind, it is like a gift wrapped christmas present. you can choose to accept it or not. presents include, salvation from the penalty of sin, peace love joy, self control, the authority over the heavens and the earth, the power of the holyspirit, the gifts of the holy spirit..<br><br>thats basically what the christian message is all about.<br><br></div>
