            <div class='col-md body'>The reason behind this practise is not to show Christians r snoobish and dont 'inter-marry'. The purpose is to ensure that the Christian do not compromise his/her faith. It seems easy to say two person with different religions can live together...true for some cases but actually how many? If people from different backgrounds, ideas and thinking can live together...what makes us think we can go that for spirituality? unless the Christian is a label Christian and dun mind holding joss sticks, go temples and etc  with the non-believer spouse.<br><br>At the end of it all, God is not going to condemn a Christian because he or she marry a non-believer spouse. The purpose of this is simply to reduce complications in a marriage. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Only 1 of them has to be a Catholic.  But both have to attend some kind of marriage preparation course by the church or some retreat for couples before they could register to get married in church.  The topics covered during the courses or retreat include Knowing about oneself, knowing about the partner, husband and wife's problems and how to face them and many other.  I have attended the retreat one, which is quite good though very intensive (cuz they went through all the topics within the weekend for all the couples).  The topics are quite suitable for non-Catholic as well.  My partner who has never attended a Catholic church in his whole life finds it refreshing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually the choice is simple. Religion or your the ONE. If you choose religion then forsake your the ONE. If you choose your the ONE then forsake your religion. What is so difficult? Juz like computer mah 0 or 1 so simple.<br><br>Problem only exists cuz you are caught half half in between. Then for those with that religion, your faith are shaken. You are being tested. Either you succeed or you backslide. Who knows a backslider may find his/her new meaning of freedom he/she has neber experienced before as compared to his/her life in those church days.</div>
