            <div class='col-md body'>Not really fly aeroplane like you guys mention...<br><br>A classmate of mine in pri 6 - We have the same interests in pets and she recommended me a pet shop in holland which promised to bring me there.  When I was bathing, she called to cancel the outing and it was fine since it was a last minute decision.<br><br>This time, the outing finally set and we meet up at Bukit Merah Central, took a bus at the interchange(couldn't rem. the bus no.).  Was wondering how come it took so long to travel to the pet shop as holland is not really that far from the central and she told me, it's not there yet.  Fine, be patience and guess what...<br><br>The bus routed back to Bukit Merah Interchange -.- speechless...<br><br>I am no longer in contact with her for years and lately saw her on the same bus as me with her arms full of tattoos.</div>
