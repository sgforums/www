            <div class='col-md body'>1)"Only I Can Have This!!"(Title)<br>An 8 year old boy walks home from school each day past an 8 year old girls house. One day as he is passing by, carrying a football, he can't resist taunting the girl. He holds up the football and says,<br>"See this football? Football is a boys game, and only boys can have a football!".<br>The little girl runs into the house and cries to her mother, "I want a football!" Being a woman of the 90's, her mother runs out and gets her one. The next day the girl is waiting for the little boy and he rides up on his bike.<br><br>She holds up the football... "Nah Na Nah Nah".<br><br>The little boy angrily points to his bike and says,<br>"Oh yeah, well this is a boys bike and only boys get boys bikes and you can't have one!"<br><br>She runs in to mom and the next day is waiting for him on her new boys bike.<br><br>The little boy gets furious and pulls down his pants, and pointing to his most private of parts says,<br>"Look, only boys have these and your mom can't buy you one!!!".<br><br>The next day he walks by and says to her,<br>"Well, I guess I showed you!" to which she promptly pulls up her dress, points to her parts and proclaims "My mother tells me that as long as I have one of these I can have as many of THOSE as I want!!!....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>2)"The Fly That Dropped 6 Inches"(Title)<br>There was a fly flying 6 inches above a lake.<br><br>A fish in the lake thinks, "If that fy dropped 6 inches I'd get it!!!"<br><br>A bear on land thinks, "If that fly dropped 6 inches, the fish would jump out of the water, and I'd get it!"<br><br>A hunter thinks, "If that fly drops 6 inches, the fish would jump, the bear will go to get the fish, and I'll shoot the bear"<br><br>A mouse thinks, "If that fly drops 6 inches, the fish would jump, the bear would go to get the fish, the hunter will go to get the bear, and I'll steal the cheese off his sandwich!"<br><br>A cat thinks, "If that fly drops 6 inches, the fish would jump, the bear would go to get the fish, the hunter will go to get the bear, the mouse will go get the cheese, and I'll get that mouse!!!"<br><br>Suddenly it all happened,<br>The fly dropped 6 inches, the fish got the fly, the bear get the fish, the hunter got the bear, the mouse got the hunter's cheese, but the cat missed the mouse and fell in the water!!!!!<br><br>The Moral Of This Story Is..................<br><br>"Everytime time a fly drops 6 inches, a pussy gets wet!!!"....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>The Pain Divider Machine"(Title)<br>A man took his pregnant wife to the hospital to give birth. The doctor told them that he'd developed a new machine and asked if they'd like to try it. The machine would take some of the woman's pain away and give it to the father thereby easing the mothers burden.<br><br>The couple thought it was a good idea and agreed to give it a try. The Doc set it on 10% to begin with, telling the man that 10% was still probably more pain than he had ever felt. The man was surprised at how little pain he was feeling and asked for it to be increased. The doctor turned it up to 20% with the same results. This trend continued until the machine was set at 100%.<br><br>After the delivery both mother and father felt fine. The wife was relieved at having an almost painless labor and the father was still amazed at how little pain was actually involved. Later, when they took the baby home, they found the mailman dead on their doorstep....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>A girl chanced upon her father showering in the morning. Pointing at the appendage between his legs, she asked "Daddy, when will I get one of those?" Glancing at his watch, her dad said... "Just as soon as your mother leaves for the office!"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>One girl to another: "My dad's d##k's smaller than your dad's" "Yeah.
