            <div class='col-md body'>My friend, who was a mother at the age of 17, now at age of 19, her husband is planning to file divorce with her. The problem is that, her in-laws are quite well to do while my friend has a working father with CNB, and herself as a office girl in some company. Her hubby is a NS-Regular, an officer.<br><br>Problem:<br>Her husband hasn't been to visit her or the baby for nearly a year. Only his mum visits the baby around once or twice a month. Then my friend has only start working for around 5 months. She has juz received confirmation. If the in-laws were to get Private Investigators get proof of the living conditions, do you guys think can it serve as an evidence? My friend's mum looks after the baby when she is not around. Moreover, her dad is a bad tempered person, or rather, her whole family are very bad ill-tempered. She consulted a community lawyer, and he says its to her disadvantage. Cause the other party is richer. Her only weapon is that the husband hasn't been visiting the baby for nearly a year. Not even a call. But how can she prove it? Only the neighbours, but then again, who would wanna stand up for her? All this while, the baby has been staying with her since birth.<br><br>Anyone have any knowledge on law regarding this case? Please reply. Thanks.</div>

Please reply. Thanks.</div></blockquote>Custody of the child is USUALLY granted to the mother in most instances... UNLESS the father has STRONG CASE to show that the mum is UNFIT for the child... In this case, quite unlikely... Despite the fact that the young mum's family has a bad temper, have they in any way caused any harm to the child...? If they haven't, the family's temper shouldn't be much of a concern in this case.....<br><br>The FACT that the child has been with the mum for around 2 years (and properly taken care of..) would most likely render the mum FIT for the upbringing of the child, DESPITE the fact of whether she has evidence against her husband not visiting the child for 2 years... That's just ADDED BONUS if allowed for...<br><br>If the husband finds that the wife is too poor to support the child, she can always apply for MAINTENANCE in favour of the spoken child....<br><br>The MAIN CONCERN here IF permited, would be the husband's family background... As in whether they has 'ways' to get across the 'red tape'....?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>For more information and advices, you can always suggest for her to visit the Legal Aid Burea for advice... Should cost her only a $1 for that....<br><br>Regards....</div>
