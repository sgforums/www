            <div class='col-md body'>Going for a date would never be the same again if you know the type of guy you are hanging out with. Understanding his atypical character may just help to make or break the relationship. No hard and fast rules here, but rather an insight to what you may want to achieve and derive at the end of the day.<br><br>Loving the Smooth Operator<br><br>The Ladies man is clearly distinct. Friendly, smooth and sociable, he is THE man in the eyes of the female gender. Poised, cultured and image-conscious, he will never be spotted in less than a branded suit or much less a barbered hair cut. Living in an edge above the rest, he probably adorns good wine and fine cuisine.<br><br>Similarly, he will love his women sexy yet confident. Flaunt if you can in a well-tasted manner. Elegant cocktail dress with the elegant accessories and makeup will never fail to impress such a man.<br><br>Date venues obviously will not be the ordinary dinner, treat him to a classical concert or an elegant dinner. Always bearing in mind, as much as you like to be seen with him, he would like to be seen as well.<br><br>Romancing the Soccer Dude<br><br>Down to earth, this guy breathes of nothing but the boy-next-door. Fashionably casual, his wardrobe will most likely consist of jeans/shorts and T-shirts.<br><br>Balancing it, he would probably love his women to be natural and simple more than feminine. A smart casual look with Capri pants and a nice Tee or a pleasant top would be more than delightful.<br><br>A delightful romantic date would be a picnic in the outdoors with a simple menu of a bottled wine and some gourmet sandwiches.<br><br>Checking out the Arty-Farty Guy<br><br>Introspective, deep thinking, this is one guy you could never succeed to fully understand. He is probably the hippiest and upcoming profiled in the arts industry. Spotting a funky hairdo with a ear-ring or two, he always look cool in his Calvin KleinÂ’s or Levis.<br><br>Attracting such a personality can only go to extremes. Either spot a ultra sleek and sexy look in the ever loved little black dress with hard red lipstick, alternatively spot a cool look with a tube top with hipsters and boots.<br><br>Dating the unconventional is all about being conventional. A simple meal at the local hawker center or bring out the child in him to rated G movies like Walt DisneyÂ’s would be most unexpected date for him.<br><br>Dating the Mr Goodie<br><br>This is one conventional fashion setter. Most likely to be seen in polos and conservatively-cut pants, he reads and loves to keep abreast of news and enjoys doing low-keyed activities like watching a movie.<br><br>If you have a fetish for pink, do not feel ashamed to wear your frilly skirts or your wrap around dresses. Keep the make-up light and pleasant, wear you hair loose, the key is to keep that sweet girl image.<br><br>Being conventional does not mean boring. Treat your man to an adventurous meal at a Greek restaurant. He is game to try something exciting.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
