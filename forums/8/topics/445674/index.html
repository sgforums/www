              <p>what is important is what your finances can handle.. and i don't mean just paying it off.. because when the flat is totally paid off, you will be at an age where retirement looms.. what you need to do now is to sit down and figure out what kind of finances you need.. then start planning and budgeting for it...</p>
              <p>what is $1 now, inflation may cause it to be $1.05 tomorrow (looking at 2011 inflation rate which was very high but it is best to plan conservatively)</p>
              <p>factor in how much your children will cost and the cost of their tertiary education.. say, $100,000 (today's money) and factor inflation and time into that... give it maybe 7% since tertiary education costs have been going up about 6% a year (not inflation but just the numbers)</p>
              <p>then you need to factor in how much you need during your retirement.. start planning now for it because time is on your side.. what little you can put away in conservative investments will balloon over the next 30 years... that can be your nestegg for retirement...</p>
              <p>do not think of "downgrading" your flat as an option because if everything goes to shit and the bottom falls out of the market, your downgrading may not even pay for anything...</p>
              <p>then there are miscellaneous things like your insurance, your conservancy, your utility bills and if you have a car, the car loan...</p>
              <p>go sit down with a good financial manager (not the idiots selling insurance, they're useless) and plan it all out.. a good financial manager will help you get properly insured (not the bullshit "whole life" or "savings" insurance which are only there to line their own pockets).. how to budget for everything, how much to set aside, how to invest your savings, how to put away money for your children's education and most importantly how to generate enough for a comfortable retirement and be financially independent</p>

              their dreams. =)</p>
              <p>In Singapore, most citizens end up becoming a slave to their
              house, can you believe it??? Husband and wife, work 30 years, just
              to have 1 roof over their head. By the time they pay finish, you
              think they still got the energy to pursue their dreams?</p>
              <p>Moreover, during these 30 years, every month have to worry about
              being retrenched or losing job. They cannot afford to go jobless,
              so when they quit their job, you die die must need another job
              instantly, otherwise jia lak...</p>
              <p>Sometimes I think to myself, is this the life I think we should
              live? Are we giving too much credit to Singapore government who
              keeps claiming how good Singapore is?</p>
              <p>I tell you how good Singapore is... You need a job for 30 years
              to pay off "affordable" housing loan and then every morning/evening
              peak hour you squeeze in the train to kick start and end your day
              both in misery... for the next 30 years... just to have 1 roof over
              your head... =D</p>

              <p>30 yrs of funds locked up in a worthless concrete cage. So worthless that even banks dun want them as collateral.</p>
              <p>Same thing applies for car.</p>
              <p>No wonder everyone is wondering where had all the money disappeared to.</p>
              <p>It was mentioned in another thread that the cost of building an apartment is around $100k, so we are paying like $200k over the building cost.</p>
              <p>Imagine if every household have this $200k to spend. That is what I would call an economic stimulus.</p>

              <p>And to TS:</p>
              <p>Regarding what size of flat to get, ask yourself.</p>
              <p>Are your parents, in-laws going to move in with you?</p>
              <p>how many children do you intend to have?</p>
              <p>Do you really need such a big house?</p>
              <p>Afterall, there is no point in getting a 5 room flat, when you are most probably only going to use the master bedroom, and leave the other rooms empty.</p>
              <p>The price of 3 room flat seems the most stable, with little fluctuation, and is also the most value for money. $150k</p>
              <p>4 room is when you intend to have 2 or more children. But think about it. for 1 extra room, you are paying twice the amount of money of a 3 rm flat. Not very worth it.</p>
              <p>However, investment-wise, 4rm and above, the prices fluctuate greatly, and thus have great potential for returns.</p>
              <p>Have to factor in interest and the length of repayment. at 3% interest, 30 yr loan, you will end up paying a 90% interest. Unless you are confident that your house will double in price, avoid going into lengthy repayment length.</p>
              <p>Happy house shopping!</p>

              I know next to nothing about HDB prices and their spaces but here's my take on your point.
              
              You said $500k for 5 room, $360k for 4 room.
              
              You're paying $140k more for a bigger living room, slightly larger master bed room and kitchen.
              
              Living rooms are often "laced" with the same furnitures - TV, sofa, etc. Its just a place to relax and occasionally, to entertain guests. How frequently are you required to do that? Do you have relatives and friends visiting every now and then? I've got a really small living room and there are 6 people in my family. It fits us just nicely, but when guests come, we've got nowhere to sit. We will have to grab stools and manipulate whatever little space we have left. I don't know how it goes for other people but for my family and I it hasn't been a problem. Let's say your visitors want to play mahjong. You can just use a room and open a table. Its less noisy that way too!
              
              If you limit the things you are going to put in the room to neccessities, you'll probably have more than sufficient space with a 4 room.
              
              Do you really need a big kitchen? Work with the space. After all, technology is so advanced now and you can do and store a lot more with small spaces. As long as you get the right furnitures, I think you'll be fine.
              
              Just my 2cents worth. Feel free to rebut because frankly, its my first time reading about a topic like that. Would be nice to be corrected and to learn the ropes the right way, :).
              
              Good luck with your decision-making!
