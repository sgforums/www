            <div class='col-md body'>Before u ppl read on... I would like to say that this post is not directed to offend anyone... Read on at your own free will... (Day One... Chirstianity)<br><br>First... on this forum... there had been a lot of talks abt chirstianity these few... From what i had seen and read... Below is what i would like to say...<br>Of course... there are many things that i dun understand in this world... Inculding why is the humans and God, the Supreme, what ever each and other religions called it... Thus... many things i am gonna say is based on what i had seen and read...<br><br>For the past decade or so... there is a very very high amount of teens who had been converted into chirstianity... Abt this... I would say that only 50% or so of the teens are those that are really devoted to this special religion... Many had been going juz for their frenz... or go there to see "chio bu / yan dao"...  This seems to be a very disturbing trend as many of them are seeing this as a trend, to be "in"... and as our own races, we are losing our tradiotional culture. I am not saying that u cannot be a chirstian, but still, we must keep our traditional festivals, be it religious or anot... Its something that our forefathers had left for us.<br>Then, there is also a lot of talks abt CHC... I had been to their services before... and i find it utterly stupid ( No Offences to anyone)... I observed the way the ppl donate and do theiry prayer there... Someone mentioned abt " Rock music is a drug by itself" and I think that is wat CHC had been doing... Doping their believers... If CHC ever dropped their music.. I think their attendance would drop by almost 50% or more... Donating is not a bad thing... but the teens, i dun think they are working as yet and they should not juz donate all their money away... Its not their money and if they really want to donate to such a such extent... I would say, go work and "donate your harvest" and not your parents'.<br>Rock music in CHC is common... But if we do a bit more research... Go look for a series of video called " Hell's Bell"... It abt how Lucifer ( Satan ) had used music to control ppl, mainly through rocked music... I would not go into the details as how this was done... Go look it up yourself... The point i want to bing out here is that... Its sometimes very contridiciting ( i dunno how to spell  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> ) that one point, it being used as worships, praise... and the other end, seen as an medium for Satan to pass its msgs.<br>The bible.... I wonder how many people wrote it... Never really look into it... But one point i would wanna make out here is that...  What we had been reading from it is actually about what A person had said about him/her having to had hear from God etc. From my point of view... Who knows its the truth? Also, as it is deem as one of the holy book, how come changes can be made to it so easily? Old traditions can be taken out and bascially, a new book is formed? Wow... how important...  And yes, many chirstians i talked to had agured that this was recorded in history bla bla... and my ans would be: There are also many buddist and taoist events that was recorded in history etc... and they will go like "IZZIT?????"<br>This would juz go to show that many but NOT all of these ppl are ignorant... they are juz following blindly to a book... No offence... but i would deem these ppl as blind followers... * To these ppl, I would say... pls learn to understand other religions and do not always think that u are rite... and later push it to " God said it / The bible tells us so"<br>About chirstians thinking that Chirstianity is the only "true" religion... I would say that please learn to repesct other religions... Being so "true" , pls other understand that religions etc , Buddisim exisited around 2000BC or so... not least to say abt hinduisim and others... Please understand that others have their own beliefs and thinking... and not everyone is so open to Chirstianity... " God dislike followers who are fickle minded"... i forgot where i read this from... but see, if one is so fickle minded to switch convert... Go think...<br>Different kind of Chirstians, as we know... there are a lot of "branches" to chirstianity, like protestants, catholics, methodist bla bla... One thing to highlight is that they are all worshipping to the same God... but then i dun understand the differents views they have on each other and this had resulted in bloody violence so many times in history... even rite now...Is this wat a peaceful religion ever wanted? I dun think so... Learn to respect... and accept... Violence and discremination is not we need in this world...<br><br>Well, i am basically lazy to type anymore... Anyone interested to talk to me abt this is welcome to PM me... Btw, i am a buddist and taoist... My mind is sorta free thinker but then i respect all the religions in this world... As long as it for us to do kind deeds... AGAIN, I HOPE NO OFFENCE IS TAKEN... IF THERE IS... I AM SINCERELY SORRY!</div>

I dun deny that Satan do use rock musicians to spread his message but not rock music. This issue needs detailed explanation which i see no need to go on. For your info, the HYMNS or what we call boring music was once played in pubs in the older days.  Mediums can be used both ways. It all depends who uses it, dun u  agree? A TV is nothing until someone decides to put something on it. The internet is nothing until someone decides to put information into it. Is TV or INTERNET evil? I dun think so, its the people who used it in the wrong way who is evil.</span><br><br>The bible.... I wonder how many people wrote it... Never really look into it...

You already said urself that there are certain things we do not know from God, so how to explain certain things we also dun noe. The bible has 66 books written by over 40 writers over 1000 years. One thing, where did you get the idea that the bible was CHANGED? When was TRADITION taken out from the BIBLE? I was a taoist myself and i noe a bit or two but does not knowing another person's religion but knowing your own constitutes arrogance or disregards? I am sure u noe more of taoism than christianity. Same goes to some christians.</span><br><br>About chirstians thinking that Chirstianity is the only "true" religion... I would say that please learn to repesct other religions...

If you realised you have been climbing up a rambutan tree to pick durians, isnt it time to get down and climb the right tree?

We don't need religion to tell us what is right or moral - just that religion further enphasise and remind people about morals and social norms (and of course the certain spiritual principles, thoughts, etc)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>People are beast by nature.<br>People doesn't have a sense of direction in life.<br><br>And the list goes on: Religions is like a lighthouse - guiding these lost ships.<br><br>Doesn't matter if you ain't a christian or whatsoever, and would be going to hell but your morals are upright and unmatched and did a great deal of commendable good deeds - you are doing well for your own karma I believe, which is your own self.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>And the list goes on: Religions is like a lighthouse - guiding these lost ships.<br></strong><br><br>The problem starts to crop up when certain faith like to exert their stand that they are the only one *TRUE* faith and all others are fake. This is a major source of contention cuz it directly implies if you are not from that clique you are sinners and doomed to be judged when their so called Judgement Day comes.<br><br>I have no problems with their other teachings except for this particular notion they are the only *TRUE* one etc etc. Guess what ? You can't pick those you like out from that book and follow. To join their faith is to follow everything what the book says.<br><br>Remember in their faith, parents, closed ones etc are not first priority cuz afterall their Big Shot create this world. So imagine you get a wife and if she is from that faith, you will never be number 1 spot in her heart cuz that Big Shot has already ursurp the throne.<br><br>Call me anti-christ or sinner in whatever way you want. I have been told, in touch with that faith and I refuse to accept it. So according to their teachings I will burn in the lake of fire. No worry I'm now storing enuff urine to douse those flames when I'm down there hahahhahha....</div>

Nice book about her struggles as finally she make it good.<br><br>another good book is China Cry:Nora Lam story, abt how she was persecuted and tortured in China during the communist period  as  a christian.</div>

It was just a T-shirt i saw and it writes what my siggy wrote. I find it interesting because I do believe that the devil is always right beside you trying to find an opportunity to bring you down and that makes him sort of like my neighbour hehehe, sorry if you are offended but i dun really think that makes me a bad  christian (not that i am claiming to be a real good one.)</div>
