It is also this blood that protects them from the destroyer.<br><br>In Romans 5:9 (NKJV), we are once again assured that "having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him." Let us now take refuge in the blood of Christ in which we have complete protection and be fearless in facing the challenges of the world for truly<br><br>No weapon formed against you shall prosper,<br>And every tongue which rises against you in judgment you shall condemn.<br>This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD,<br>And their righteousness is from Me," says the LORD.<br><br>Isaiah 54:17<br>(NKJV)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi five!<br><br>i think so too!! :-) i haven't had the honour of seeing the miracles you said you did. but i too believe that there is this remote possibility that there is an almighty being above or around us. it is just that different religions call him by different name that's all.<br><br>just a thought that's all... shucks. am i gonna get slammed by this now?<br><br>anyway i too agree that people should remain sensitive to others. =) my lifelong goal.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by rckong:</div><div class="quote_body">free thinker here...<br><br>but oso believe in many religious existing on earth... cos seen some miracles happening before...<br><br>e.g. years back got hinduism miracles if all of u remember... the elephant god is able to consumed milk, regardless wat material it is made of and where the statue is... lasted for 3 days...<br><br>so why not take it such that different religious exists at different timing, so that they can be a choice to different ppl and lead them to their final destination...<br><br>we cannot say christians means will be totally perfect or totally craze over jesus... afterall, there are mature and good christians, there are oso naughty and rules violating christians... one kind of rice can feed and turn out different kind of ppl...<br><br>so instead of spreading ur religious around, its more mature to respect other existing religious...<br><br>of course when one shares... its out of good intention, but do remember watever u do, dun insult other religious unless u like ppl to insult ur religious... the world is so big, anything can exist... so can god in many different forms... and who knows, Jesus and Mercy of Goddess might be the same existing God that appeared in differnt forms to enlighten different ppl... ;P</div></blockquote></div>
