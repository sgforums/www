            <div class='col-md body'><br>As an advance birthday celebration, I invited my<br>friends to Sakae Sushi (Marina Square) on the 15th<br>March 2003. I must say that I am absolutely impressed<br>with the staff of this branch for presenting me with<br>such an unforgettable experience.<br><br>My friends and I were in the queue at about 6.45pm and<br>there were only 2 groups, of less than 5 each, before<br>us. Assistant Manager (trainee) Hong Jie was recording<br>down the number of people of each group so that he<br>could make the seating arrangements. When we told him<br>that we need a table for 10, he replied that there<br>weren't seats for us at that moment but we would get<br>our seats by 7.20pm. Fine, we thought, understanding<br>that it isn't easy to get seats when there's so many<br>of us. We don't mind waiting, since we (except for 2)<br>don't have any programs after that. We stood by the<br>side, chatting as we wait.<br><br>7.20pm - Groups had been leaving and others entering,<br>but no staff approached us to let us know if we could<br>go in. A few of us approached Assistant Manager<br>(trainee) Hong Jie again. He pointed to the second<br>table near the entrance, mentioning that the guests<br>there would be leaving soon and we would be sesated<br>there. As the table seemed a bit small, we enquired if<br>it could accommodate the 10 of us.  He argued that the<br>table is big enough and could take on 11 people as per<br>a past experience. In the midst of our enquiry, he<br>left to bring other guests to their seats.<br><br>10 minutes passed. The guests, whom he said would<br>leave soon, were still in their seats. We approached<br>him again (not that we wanted to, but he's the only<br>one we could grabbed hold of). We once again expressed<br>our concern that we don't think that particular table<br>could accommodate the 10 of us, and as all of us were<br>very hungry (which we weren't initially), we hoped to<br>get a table ASAP. We also suggested that he could get<br>us two smaller tables that are next to each other. He<br>grumbled that he had specially arranged that table for<br>us and only now that we told him we don't want to be<br>seated there. I felt accused. We did not state that we<br>did not want that table but that we had waited long,<br>and we seriously do not feel that we could all fit<br>into that table. And for goodness sake, anyone who had<br>brains could easily think of alternatives without the<br>customers making suggestions, and not insisting that<br>we should sit at that particular table he arranged.<br>Moreover, all the staff kept hustling around and no<br>one paid attention to our call for them. Nevertheless,<br>he said no problem confidently and went back into the<br>restaurant (seemingly making the necessary<br>arrangements).<br><br>Some time later, one group of customers left to pay<br>their bills, and another group at the table next to<br>theirs seemed to be preparing to leave. Just when we<br>thought that we would be getting those two tables, Mr<br>Hong led a couple at the queue to one of those tables<br>(when there were other seats available by the conveyor<br>belt!). Soon, he approached us and told us we would be<br>getting two tables, diagonal to each other. We<br>rejected the offer straight away, once again insisting<br>that we do not want to be separated that far. He<br>looked frustrated, but we couldn't care less. We had<br>indicated our preferences right from the beginning and<br>he should have planned better. What's the point when<br>my friends are celebrating my birthday and we wanted<br>very much to sit together so that we could chat? After<br>all, we hadn't met up for quite some time. He went<br>off.<br><br>Then, the guests at the table (which Hong Jie had<br>painstakingly reserved for us initially) left.<br>Finally, we thought, we could be seated. BUT, Mr Hong<br>brought a group of three customers into the restaurant<br>and gave the seat to them!!! After much effort, we<br>managed to get hold of him. His explanation was that<br>the table COULD NOT accommodate all of us due to the<br>lack of space! He also told us we would be getting<br>those tables at the back whereby it's bigger (when<br>they were of the same size!!).<br><br>Two of my friends left. They had an appointment at<br>8pm. They had tried to stay as long as they could.<br>They weren't given any choices then, they were already<br>late and HAD to take a CAB down to Tampines without<br>any food.<br><br>We managed to get hold of another manager in the store<br>and told her that we only need a table for 8 now, and<br>please get it ASAP for us. She's more sympathetic and<br>polite to us. She tried to help. Nevertheless, it was<br>only at around 8.45pm that we managed to get a table,<br>one of those at the back that Mr Hong said was<br>'bigger', but we need to pull extra chairs before all<br>the eight of us could be seated.<br><br>Our nightmare had not ended.<br><br>We wanted food that weren't on the belt. It took us a<br>great deal of effort before we could get someone to<br>serve us. All the staff seemed to be just walking<br>around. We were being asked to 'WAIT' a couple of<br>times by the busy waiters/waitresses (inclusive of Mr<br>Hong), but they never came back. Finally, one came and<br>took our orders, three plates of fried tofu and six<br>chawamushi, to be specific.<br><br>I guess the kitchen were waiting for the beans to<br>ferment (to get tofu) and begging the hens to lay eggs<br>(to make the chawamushi). A really tough process I<br>guess, for it took donkey years before our orders<br>arrived. I also strongly believe that Sakae must be<br>very successful in their innovation of using cold oil<br>to fry the food, for the FRIED TOFU was COLD. Economy<br>is bad; perhaps, this innovation could help Sakae save<br>on its gas and thereby cut cost?<br><br>Another painstaking effort was made before we could<br>get a waiter to place our order for some ice water. 6<br>glasses of ice water and 1 can of diet coke. The<br>waiter hurried off and returned soon. He apologized<br>politely, telling us that they had ran out of glasses<br>and asked if we could wait. ASAP please, was our<br>reply. One point to note, the restaurant was not fully<br>occupied then.<br><br>A few minutes later, the can of diet coke arrived,<br>with a glass containing ice. Our iced-water never<br>arrived till the time we left. We did not bother to<br>remind the waiter. I have to assume that Sakae had<br>used all its funds for its expansion plans and left<br>none for buying glasses? I also assumed that Sakae had<br>this policy that different types of glasses are<br>strictly meant to contain the specific type of drink?<br>No other glasses can be substituted to contain<br>iced-water?<br><br>Sometime later, one of my friends ordered fried maki<br>stick (fried crabstick), hoping that those ordered<br>would be hot as compared to those taken from the belt<br>(despite our previous experience). Fried maki stick<br>arrive... cold... ICED-COLD! (Somewhere must have gone<br>wrong with our orders, we wanted iced-water and fried<br>maki stick, but the waiter gave us a combination of<br>both! Iced-fried maki stick... another new recipe?)<br><br>We requested for the plate with one and a half maki<br>stick left to be heated up. The waitress reluctantly<br>took it away, and as usual, it took ages before the<br>maki stick returned. Hot this time, but left with one.<br>Come on, this is the kind of QUALITY food that I<br>should be getting for paying $1.90 for a plate of 2<br>tempura maki sticks when I could have gotten a pack of<br>12 maki sticks, costing only $1, and fried myself at<br>home! Furthermore, even if the maki sticks are not<br>replaced with freshly fried ones, the plate should<br>also be returned with one and a half sticks!<br>(Seriously speaking, I would never order such a dish<br>if not for my friend who is crazy about it.)<br><br>Two concerns I have to raise here.<br>Â·Is Sakae really COMMITTED to serving QUALITY food to<br>its customers as mentioned by the founder when he won<br>the Entrepreneurship award?<br>Â·Is this the kind of service that customers should get<br>for paying a PREMIUM PRICE for such common<br>MACHINE-MADE sushi that could be easily bought in<br>supermarkets and enjoyed in the comfort and better<br>ambience of one's home?<br><br>That evening was definitely one of my most<br>disappointing dining experiences ever. I had enjoyed<br>some of my past dining experience at Sakae Sushi and<br>have no qualms about recommending friends and overseas<br>visitors to the restaurant. But, with the episode on<br>the 15th of March, I do have second thoughts about it.<br><br>Pxxxx Sxx Mxx<br>-------------------------------------------<br><br>Anybody got such experience?</div>
