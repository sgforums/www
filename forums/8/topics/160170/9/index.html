Am I right, errr, nulife, and momof2?<br></div></blockquote>u're not convinced because maybe u're straight and u can't understand why gays feel the way they do?  ok i was being a bit mean in labelling everyone who has problem with gays as being closet gays in denial(although this is still often closer to the truth than u'd realise). but seriously u won't understand how a gay feels the way he does so u aren't convinced about the reasons one is gay. If u were gay u'd see the sense in it. I mean, some straight people get it, some don't. Personally , me and majority of my friends get it, and we're not gay, so maybe im just perplexed that there are some of you who don't. Then again, to gay people they wouldn't understand how u could be straight too. They just don't feel the need to be too particular about it because people are people.</div>

I just realize I am debating with a rude child.  I myself have gay and lesbian friends.  One even tried to date me when i was younger.  They told me everything from relationships to sex.  We still treat each other as "sisters" or "brothers" but I still believe that it is not normal to be homosexual.<br><br>Don't think you know so much about being gay that you have a right to say people are stupid. Go ahead and trash it out.  You are probably losing your marbles.  Grow up and learn some manners before you write again.</div>
