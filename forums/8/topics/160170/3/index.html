i guess it does. as you know, the brain has the left and right side...one is for maths or whatever....the other is for creativity...? and the way the brain distributes stuff is different in males and females, and therefore males are better in subjects like maths and physics? well...something like that anyway...<br><br>anyway, hormones cause the brain to either distribute stuff in the male or female pattern, so in a way, your right.<br><br>however, hormones DO NOT change your thoughts. i should know...i had an extremly high amount of testerone, which is the male sex hormone in case your didn't know, in me. much, much higher than your average male. you'd think with so much male hormones i'd end up extremly masculine? wrong. i was a sissy. i absolutly hated everything about being a guy, and i so desired to be a girl. the changes in my body during puberty only made me want to puke.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by NuLife:</div><div class="quote_body">have to make it clear else misunderstood.<br><br>transverstite = ok<br>gays = disgusting<br>sissies = could be gay or transverstite in the making. also disgusting.<br><br></div></blockquote>gays are perfectly normal males, except they are attracted to the same sex instead. i dont see why you should be disgusted by them because they should, in almost every way be similar to the average way, except for, like i said, that they are attracted to the same sex.<br><br>so unless they're the kind that would kiss their lover right in front of everyone to see, i dont think there should be much to get disgusted about. i doubt many would actually do that though....like how many straight guys actually go around making out with their lover in front of their friends?<br><br>transvestites....are you sure your not just saying that? cause i really dont think you mean it. transvestites are perfectly normal males who find it sexually exciting to crossdress.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">but when if u see a big guy dancing n walking lik a gal in the gym,<br>u wil really puke. i had seen b4...<br>i cant help it.. i really wanna puke...<br>its jus lik when u see a fat lady dancing... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> [/quote]<br><br>i mean, this really big guy could be a transvestite too, you'd never know. so if just walking around like a gal in the gym would disgust you, i think if you saw him in a dress you'd faint.<br><br>sissys...i guess you could say they're just men who are more effeminate, due to a higher amount of female hormones. however, no reason why you should be disgusted by them either, since they're perferctly normal males too. they're not gay, they dont crossdress, whats there to be disgusted with? they're just born physically a little more feminine. no reason for them to turn out gay or transvestite.<br><br>curious though...this is about views on gays. why the hell are transvestites being discussed about here? let me make this clear...a 'normal' transvestite IS NOT GAY, and DOES NOT WISH TO BECOME FEMALE. they just find it sexually exciting to crossdress.<br><br>[quote]Originally posted by vito_corleone:</div><div class="quote_body">sorry hor...HE is not female.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>vito, i don't see why i don't deserve to be called a female.<br><br>i'll only go so far to admit that i was born physically male. but that was due to some cruel joke by nature. psycologically, i've always have been a female. maybe im physically male, but i certainly do not feel like one, nor could i ever be one.<br><br>anyway, this is the cyber world. whether your physically deaf, mute or whatever other physically problems you may have, it is not important since it should not affect you in the cyber world (unless your blind or paralyzed). i think its more of your mind that matters here, and since im psycologically a female, i should deserve to be called a female here.</div>
