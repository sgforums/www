Maybe singapore don't dare to show it because they are afraid of learning truths. But it is a very sure thing that being gay is very much due to genes.<br><br>finally, to be honest, gay people are often more open-minded and thus don't feel the need to actually try to discuss straight people, because there is nothing to discuss. u're gay, u're gay. u're straight, u're straight. thats something they can see, unfortunately, many straight people seem to have trouble opening up to this simple wisdom. Or maybe they really are gays in denial which is why its so hard for them to see and accept anything. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Gays have become more vocal about having greater participation in society. But if gays want greater acceptance, the biggest mistake is to put society on the defensive. We live in a relatively conservative society which is much more religious than many western nations.<br><br>It is a fact that adherents of two major religions believe homosexuality is contrary to the teachings of their faiths. They do not seek to convert homosexuals, but do not want gay people to turn their children against the teachings of their mosques and churches either.<br><br>Instead of reassuring religious Singaporeans that gays will respect their religions, I have seen gay people attacking religious teachings and trying to ridicule revered religious texts. That is the worse mistake they can make, for they have magnified the fears of the conservative majority in so doing.<br><br>My views on gays? I have no issue with they do in the privacy of their homes but it is the arrogance and complete disregard for the cultural and religious sensitivities of the majority that irks me.</div>
