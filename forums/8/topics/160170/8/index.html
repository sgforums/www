            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by mumof2:</div><div class="quote_body">Why get so uptight and abusive?  Every unsatisfied criticism is confronted by your "bigoted" comments.  Everyone seems to come out from a cave and is retarded.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Face criticism objectively!<br><br>Convincing a Chinese he is black?  If a Chinese is borned to be a Chinese, there is no need to convince he is black.<br><br>Even if humans may evolve from animals, why are you still in a cave behaving like them?  Humans are humans.  There is no relationship with "thinking of ourselves highly" with being homosexuality.  Animals and human may in some form in some time be linked with each other.  But why pull this off with homosexuality?<br><br>Do not assume that the new century will condone homosexual as the latest fad or the norm.  Only homosexuals are accepting themselves.<br><br>If everyone starts to "mate" with the same sex in this world, what would happen??  Ageing homosexuals, confused, without offsprings and probably dead due to sex diseases.  Birth rate will be absolutely out of sight.<br><br>Yes, I do agree that there are other sexual activities that are considered unnatural just like the man mating with the man.<br><br>I believe this psychological problem can be reversible because it did change some of their minds after many years.  In Australia,  a gay and lesbian couple are willing to be counselled (by a non profit organization) and met together.  They tried very hard to turn "straight". But they did fall in love and later married and has kids.  This case was shown in a programme years ago about homosexuality on cable if I can remember.  The couple was interviewed and talked about the process.  There is definitely a choice.  They are one of those who have chose to lead a normal life!<br><br>Now what evolution?  </div></blockquote>1stly, do u know how much unnecessary suffering your sort of ignorance is causing others?<br><br>2ndly, the defination of bigotry is given by the dictionary not me.<br><br>3rdly, if a chinese is born chinese, no need to convince him. hence if a gay is born a gay, no need to convince him he's straight either. Alternatively, those people born straight but turn gay, will not be happy in life. In my opinion those are the people who need to be convinced they're not gay.<br><br>4thly, Do not assume that Singapore society represents the new century. A lot of straight people overseas have no problems accepting homosexuality. Nobody is seeing it as a latest fad or norm. They're accepting that thats the way nature works: with diversity.<br><br>5thly, this is once again a stupid argument. I've said b4 and i'll say again, the "What if everyone mates with the same sex" argument is sooooo stupid that to say it shows how much u lack in intelligence. No species will every be 100% gay. Its hardwired into the genetic make up. Just as there will always be homosexuality in ANY given species on this planet, so there will ALWAYS be a percentage of ANY given species on this planet being straight. I don't see the point of taking extremes like "IF everyone was gay" for arguments do u? Thats something that just won't happen because nature's diversity rules it out. To try to argue with this line of argument, thats just dumb.<br><br>6thly, I would like to hear u swear u've never used a condom in your life because it is unnatural.<br><br>7thly, I said up there there are straight people who somehow think they are gay. They benefit from counselling perhaps. But counselling has also led to many suicides among homosexual people. Honestly, are u 100% sure they are satisfied with their lives now? Or are they pressurised into thinking they have to show the whole world they are "ok" now because everyone has put so much effort into them? So many new underlying factors introduced into that case that it is hard to take as a good judgement of whether it is possible. U should quote cases where gay people realise they aren't gay and turn straight on their own. But in any case this argument also reminds me of the past when chinese people squeezed their foot into shoes too tiny for the sake of beauty. There's a choice because they probably weren't gay to begin with. Thats something u fail to see.</div>

Did I say it came from you? If I did, when did I say that? Your friend is your friend. Does not concern me. Still, who is this friend? Some master of theology? One dumb view the probably disagree with 99.99% of all biblical teachings and you go listen.... Let's just say that you agreed to that view because it fitted your own world view.<br><br>I guess it does not matter if you use the word Bigot, then I guess it does not matter if I call you b-itch would it? After all you fit the bill.... Er maybe butch? I can't decide whether it's the letter U or the letter I.<br><br>At the end of the day it does not matter because no matter how much I say that I am not really against gay, you would still conclude that anyone with just an inkling of question is against this life style and you would still call this individual a bigot. So Ok lah bigot, bigot lah..... so you b-itch lah <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
