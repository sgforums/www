I mean it is all for sex isn't it?  Sex between a man and a man.  It is not natural and normal.<br><br>Just like the female human's body is designed for expecting only a maximum of one to two fetus in its 9 months of gestation, a male and female human body are designed by nature to fit each other.<br><br>Yes, there are other animals which has a heterosexual nature.  But we are humans.  Unusual sex disease is one of the result of going against the nature.<br><br>Gay or lesbians, I believe this thinking can be reversible and nurse their minds back to where they should be and where they are originally - if they are willing.  A normal human being is physically and mentally balanced.  </div></blockquote>well judging from your bigotted thots, then u must be a physically and mentally unbalanced individual. Got make appt to see shrink already?<br><br>Gay and lesbian thinking reversible? U think its a choice ah? The only choice they have is to be in denial, or accept themselves. U might as well try to convince a chinese that he is black. In any case, SEX is a subset of love, not the other way around. Of course u get the sluts, but in any case, there is no such thing as its not natural or normal.<br><br>Humans are just another species of the animal kingdom, dun think too highly of yourself. We may be able to make wonderful things, but lots of things like understanding ultrasound/sonar at a basic primal level, we cannot do. We cannot see in 3D triangulation(machiam like GPS but even more accurate) the way dolphins can. Dun think we are so special that something other species in nature have, we cannot have. THAT sort of thinking is REALLY going against nature. U know what else? By your argument, if u indulge in foreplay, in any other forms of sex like oral, or u use any sort of copntraceptives esp condoms, U're also not normal n not natural.<br><br>So b4 u want to shoot off bigotted ideas, make sure u dun have double standards.<br><br>in any case, can i also ask u which cave did u crawl out from, and how did evolution miss out on u?</div>

And in case u dunno, humans DO display the alpha male trait too. Why do u think we wage war? To annilihate other tribes of course. Other things like clothes, they are simply tools to make our lives better, and if monkeys employ tools, why not us? Give u 1 ex: chimpanzees use sticks as tools to get ants out of anthills to eat.<br><br>finally, i will ask u again to stop being daft, because just because i consider other species equal to mine, doesn't mean i have to mate out of species. I don't think u will see lions attempting to mate with zebras. But they're all animals. Mating within species doesn't prove any one animal species(including us) any more superior than others. This is a very simple logic, if u can't understand, then I will have to wonder if somewhere along the way u took a wrong turn down the evloutionary road. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>gawd i wish people who were homophobic were at least a bit more evolved mentally (altho thats impossible because if they were they wouldn't be homophobic anymore) Lidat keep going me stupid arguments that are so easy to rebute because they dun have logic. No challenge one. Somemore they get annoyed becos nobody likes to be told the sad truth that they're either mentally less evolved or that they might be gay in denial(esp gays in denials). Oh well... so boring. I go n do my tutorial liao. its a bit more taxing mentally.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>just thought of one more point while toasting cheese. Humans desire companionship, not procreation. If that was so, humans would get together, have sex, have kids, and then go their seperate ways. The fact that many humans stay together till old, shows that companionship, not procreation, is top pirority. Many couples stay together till death do them part, but never have children.</div>

U might as well try to convince a chinese that he is black. In any case, SEX is a subset of love, not the other way around. Of course u get the sluts, but in any case, there is no such thing as its not natural or normal.<br><br>Humans are just another species of the animal kingdom, dun think too highly of yourself. We may be able to make wonderful things, but lots of things like understanding ultrasound/sonar at a basic primal level, we cannot do. We cannot see in 3D triangulation(machiam like GPS but even more accurate) the way dolphins can. Dun think we are so special that something other species in nature have, we cannot have. THAT sort of thinking is REALLY going against nature. U know what else? By your argument, if u indulge in foreplay, in any other forms of sex like oral, or u use any sort of copntraceptives esp condoms, U're also not normal n not natural.<br><br>So b4 u want to shoot off bigotted ideas, make sure u dun have double standards.<br><br>in any case, can i also ask u which cave did u crawl out from, and how did evolution miss out on u?</div></blockquote>Why get so uptight and abusive?  Every unsatisfied criticism is confronted by your "bigoted" comments.

If a Chinese is borned to be a Chinese, there is no need to convince he is black.<br><br>Even if humans may evolve from animals, why are you still in a cave behaving like them?  Humans are humans.  There is no relationship with "thinking of ourselves highly" with being homosexuality.  Animals and human may in some form in some time be linked with each other.  But why pull this off with homosexuality?<br><br>Do not assume that the new century will condone homosexual as the latest fad or the norm.  Only homosexuals are accepting themselves.<br><br>If everyone starts to "mate" with the same sex in this world, what would happen??  Ageing homosexuals, confused, without offsprings and probably dead due to sex diseases.  Birth rate will be absolutely out of sight.<br><br>Yes, I do agree that there are other sexual activities that are considered unnatural just like the man mating with the man.<br><br>I believe this psychological problem can be reversible because it did change some of their minds after many years.  In Australia,  a gay and lesbian couple are willing to be counselled (by a non profit organization) and met together.  They tried very hard to turn "straight". But they did fall in love and later married and has kids.  This case was shown in a programme years ago about homosexuality on cable if I can remember.  The couple was interviewed and talked about the process.  There is definitely a choice.  They are one of those who have chose to lead a normal life!<br><br>Now what evolution?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i wish to point out that a lot of people who went through the counselling session, which u described is from a certain church from queenstown, are actually more depressed than ever. guess what was said to them? homosexuality is a SIN! U must never sin or u are not going to heaven or receive god's forgiveness. these are the things said to them. if u think counselling is ok, why need to invoke religion? and the only people trying to change gays to straights are christians.<br><br>in the first place y are u anti gay? it's not like straight ppl are free from sexual diseases? go to the DSC clinic and u see more straights.<br><br>and if u think gayness is going to spread to people like a cultural thingy, think u are super myopic.<br><br>asian culture had always been very tolerant towards alternative lifestyle. it is because of the advancement of americanism that we have changed. religious beliefs have also influenced the minds of many.</div>

I just do not see the relevancy of your reasons.</div></blockquote>well, I still think Paul was a bigot, and yes I think that since it is prevalent in other animal species I see no reason why it shouldn't be prevalent in the human species. We wear clothes, but animals don't. That doesn't mean our species are above animals. Many species do things particular to their own. Elephants use their noses as hands. No other species does that. Does that mean they are above other animal species as well?<br><br>Lets face it. Your reasoning that we MUST do everything animals do to be considered part of the order of living beings is ridiculous. At a cell level, we're basically the same as other mammals. In big cats, their strength and their senses are highly developed. In many birds of prey, their eyesight are highly developed. In humans, their brains are developed. Its just different development of each species that leads to them being what they are, doesn't mean that just because humans developed this way, we're completely seperate from animals as a category. Last I recalled, the category of mammals sit under the animal kingdom and we sit squarely inside the mammal category. Unless of course, u would like to declare yourself as a cold blooded being, in which case, U might be eligible to be considered out of the animal kingdom. Sucking blood every night to stay alive for eternity would be quite sucky for you tho, wouldn't it?<br><br>My point is humans are animals. Animals are often different from one another, but u seriously THINK that we're so different that if other animal species exhibit homosexuality, we shouldn't? Last I recall, human desire is for companionship 1st, love, then finally reproduction. There are straight couples who decide to never have children, so why is it considered 'wrong' for gay couples to exist? They are sharing that one sacred thing which is so sorely lacking in this world. Love. Lets forgo all talk about slutty people who indulge in ONS. They exist in straight people, they exist in gay people. The point is that love is more important than all your theories about why people should not be gay.<br><br>Finally, Im sorry but I didn't call u a bigot. The dictionary did. If u're against the reasons why humans are gay, even if you're not bothered by them, it's still a prejudice against them because u think they are 'wrong'. And that, by defination from the dictonary, is bigotry.<br><br>And u'd be hard pressed to condemn me, since im not gay.</div>
