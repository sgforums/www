Religious beliefs have proven to be wrong time and time again. Earth at the center of the universe, earth is flat, it is right to kill in the name of (insert religion name here)'s God. Sounds familiar? Just because they don't believe that sexuality is diversified in all living beings, doesn't make that a fact, and the fact also remains that those gay people who were born into a religious family, will end up suffering. Should they be allowed to suffer due to ignorance? Is religion a good excuse for discrimination? There are some things u have to speak up against, even if it means speaking up against religion. The problem with too many people is they THINK the world revolves around their religion, to the extent they don't even respect other religions. I can name at least 2... C*******ns and M****ms. IF u wanna talk about religious sensitivity, maybe u;d do well to start off from them.</div>

Is this natural?<br><br>You think you are trapped in a man's body and you feel like a woman.  Or a trapped in a girl's body and feel like a boy.<br><br>You feel, you think but physically you are what you are!  That is the fact.  Many probably let their hearts rule their head.

What can a man and another man produce?<br><br>I personally feel it is abnormal to be attracted to the same sex.   You have flings, or you may have sex diseases, or live this way until you are old.

Since singapore is a multi-racial society, combating  bigotry is important to the society. So why do u have to differentiate between racial bigotry and sexuality bigotry? Or do u mean they should take bigotry lying down just "for the sake" of society?<br><br>The way I see it, its the people who indulge in bigotry to begin with who are at fault for marginalizing others. The way I see it, its a no win situation. U either take bigotry lying down n get marginalized, or u speak up against it and get marginalized for speaking up against bigotry anyway. Meanwhile the REAL culprits don't get any blame. What stupid logic.</div>

I think bigoted people are even more mentally challenged. They seem to have trouble understanding simple concepts or be open minded about them. They must be all retarded, bigots.<br><br>or perhaps they're so insecure of themselves that they must belong to a group and then label themselves as 'normal' and anyone else who don't belong in the same group as being 'abnormal'<br><br>so take your pick bigots. Are u retarded, or insecure?</div>
