Not all PI will do it, but you can try "cham-sionging" with him to book our test with only a few practical lessons.<br><br>Half a yr back, it was $22 per hr on weekdays and $24 / hr for weekends. Way cheaper than BBDC or SSDC man...<br><br>Ok average to pass with a PI is $1000-1500, school being min $2500... double man!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anybody kind enough to explain to me how the system works?<br><br>Can you just show up at the test centre and tell them you want to go for a road test and tell them you are ready for it? (Like in N. America provided you've got your learners)<br><br>OR is it that in Singapore you must somehow show documentary proof you have learnt driving thru a government certified instructor?<br><br>Can't your parents/friends teach you? (akin to N. America, provided they have full 2-axle privilege license)<br><br>Finally.... good question....  maybe we can start a thread on this.<br>Why do some countries drive on the right and some drive on the left?<br><br>It just confuse me easily whenever i go back Singapore to drive. Maybe some of you experienced the following when you go to a foreign country or return to singapore.<br><br>1. your left(right) hand grabbing the empty air and wondering where the Tranmission stick is.<br><br>2. turning left(right) and seeing opposing traffic towards you.<br><br>3.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm... I don't think it's possible to get a class 3 lic. in 2-3 mths time. It's just that all driving centres are almost overflowing with students. Anyway, got my lic. way back in 1995 when in JC. I was lucky as the govtn. only amended the age to 18 yr old that yr.<br>For u guys who are learning at BBDC, pray that u don't "kanna" the Malay tester who spots a beard. I'm not being racist but this guy is nuts. Seems like it's almost IMPOSSIBLE to pass the driving test if he is u'r tester. I passed BBDC's final prac. test with only 6 demerit pts but this #$@^%* gave me 48 demerit pts for my first test. Finally got my lic. on the second try.<br>So GOOD LUCK to all future drivers.<br><br>REMEMBER: If u DRINK, don't DRIVE!! My friend was killed by a DRUNK driver.<br><br></div>
