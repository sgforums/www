            <div class='col-md body'>Not sure what the preoccupation is with cars because I am a woman and I don't really care for cars. We need to have cars here in the US for convenience's sake. I don't care what kind of car or the size of the car you drive as long as it works. Cars depreciate in value really fast and I don't believe in spending tons of $$$ buying a brand new BMW or Ferrari. I'd rather save the money for something else.<br><br>I guess it must be a status symbol thing for singaporeans but I remember when I was growing up in singapore, cars were no big deal to me. We had a chauffeur driving my grandfather's car and people think we were loaded (we weren't loaded but were just doing fine).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Haha all this car talk...anw abt that rich part? I guess its really up to the individual. My dad's car is an old...i mean really old '86 model Honda. He doesnt seem intent on changing it even though its so old simply becuz it still works. My mum wanted to buy him a new car too but he stopped her. He just doesnt want to spend money on a new car that'll do the same job as the current one. Also, he pointed out that many young people these days take HUGE loans to buy things that they don't need to impress people they don't know. Whats the point?<br><br>Personally i feel the same way too. If i live in a larger country, a car becomes a neccessity. But the transport system here is good enough that you can get along well enough without one. Also...if i really am that rich that i can buy the car(s) that i want with cash then its something. I guess even in singapore there's a place for such cars becuz the owners worked real hard for them and besides, life is short...reward yourself if you really can.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Oh and about the 200k at 10% per annum? I say this...i would rather buy a Merc or Beamer. Not a new one but an old beat up one then use the rest of the 200k to rebuild. If u buy those rare enough and do it up well enough...it won;t be 10% per annum returns...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For me as a male answering on behalf or if I was in the shoe of the majority females who live on average income, I would answer no. Anyway, with the slow recovering economy, itÂ’s hard to earn a decent salary as compared to the ninety. Females who know the Singapore Economy condition now wants males to bring in stable income or even better income to sustain the living expenses in Singapore. A male being able to provide a stable and decent lifestyle is of primary importance to the Singaporean females. A male having a car is secondary.</div>
