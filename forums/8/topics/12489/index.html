I can<br>be very "on" in doing things. One thing for sure you would definitely go for<br>reservists. Come on you think I would knock you down, I would recommend some<br>extras for you to do, as you know it is very easy to get extras in the army.<br>If fact you can get extras for no reasons. I think you must also be aware<br>that I could charge people as well. SO BEWARE<br><br>-----Original Message-----<br>From: Teo Huai Wei [mailto:teo10131@pacific.net.sg]<br>Sent: Sunday, August 26, 2001 09:13 PM<br>To: 'evage@singnet.com.sg'<br>Subject: RE: Testing, testing, 1 2 3<br><br>Frankly, I don't know why I bother carrying on this silly conversation with<br>you, but since we've come thus far, maybe I'll just give a bit more of my<br>two cents' worth.<br><br>First and foremost, u seem to possess a strange tendency of putting others<br>down. You apparently attach a very high value to that rank of yours, but may<br>I remind you that it is but just a rank as an NSF (versus a regular) in the<br>SAF (versus Israel's). Big deal? I don't think so. Hey, I mean, how many<br>times are you compelled enough to go home from camp in your full uniform<br>just to show your rank to the general public during your NSF days? And if<br>you do, you expect the public to look at you with respect? Please face<br>reality, friend. This is Singapore, not Taiwan, where armed forces personnel<br>are treated as national heroes. So with that misplaced pride on something as<br>mundane as two small patches of string, you expect others to regard you with<br>fear? Oh man, I'm so scared....<br><br>Second, I find it rather incredulous that I have to remind you that rules<br>and regulations in the SAF exist for the cohesive running of the various<br>forces, not as an instrument to whit the appetites of a lone man's selfish<br>ego and ambitions. You desire to abuse the rules hinges on the brink of pure<br>childishness. And I have some things I need to bring to your attention, in<br>case you face embarrassment in future: 1. Sure, the army can be extremely<br>unfair, especially in the days of full-time NSF, but (oh no!) the reservist<br>period is a completely different story. There, ranks count next to nothing,<br>and if anyone tries to play stupid tricks on me, don't expect me to sit back<br>and accept whatever is meted out without question. 2. Charge? Yeah, they are<br>only fines actually. Peanuts when you compare with your future pay. And of<br>course you need a heck of a damn good reason to put me in the cell, if you<br>insist. And finally, you can't charge, only recommend. Do not assume others<br>do not have assess or don't read military documents.<br><br>Third, I do not see any reason why you need to mention about being "on". And<br>yeah, of course I'll do reservists, but not necessarily so in the Army. And<br>can you stop me from downgrading in future if I have to? And finally, I<br>almost laughed when you claim that your supposedly "Very high" rank is going<br>to mean that you will excel in the civilian work force. Naive indeed. Please<br>enlighten me regarding this claim. And please tell me what you will do if I<br>happen to be your superior. As for me, I will love to invite you to my<br>office and listen to all your oh-so-interesting talk about the way you treat<br>your subordinates during<br>reservist. I'll love to see just how much joy you can derive from that.<br><br>And come to think of it, it makes me wonder how someone with such<br>"articulate" use of the English language can expect to rise up to the<br>pinnacle of<br>society. Still, I wish you well. Good luck.<br><br>Yours,<br>Huaiwei<br><br>p.s. But if you are just talkin cock, then just pretend that whatever I've<br>said above are meant for someone else. Okie? :<br><br>-----Original Message-----<br>From: evage@singnet.com.sg<br>[mailto:evage@singnet.com.sg]<br>Sent: Monday, August 27, 2001 09:36 PM<br>To: teo10131@pacific.net.sg<br>Subject: hahaha<br><br>Oh so you are saying that my language is lousy. Look you are from Serangoon<br>Junior College which is not RJC, NJC not even ACJC. So why talk about<br>language, if you are really that good then you won't be in Arts and Social<br>Science. Cut the crap of telling me that you wanted to study subjects<br>from this faculty. The fact is your results sucks just like your junior<br>college.<br><br>Next according to chapter 295 of the mindef directive a NS officer could<br>charge people but first have a valid reason and next he got to discuss it<br>with his immediate superior. Note I put it as discuss because it is as good<br>as the guy would be charged, the only reason to inform superior is only for<br>"show". Sorry I forgot to tell you before I commissioned I was once out of<br>course and was appointed as a clerk and all this directive stuff, I know it<br>at the back of my<br>hand.<br><br>Moreover don't count your chickens before the eggs hatches, who knows that<br>you may be earning a lot. You may fail your first year in University, you<br>may get retained or this are possibilities that might happen. Once again<br>don't tell me this would not happen. For people from RJC I think not but for<br>people from SRJC it would be hard to say.<br><br>In addition just for your info if I sign on, even by the time I retire, I<br>would be guaranted a place in the civil sector. The pay would somehow be the<br>same as what I earn. But for you, you won't sign on because you don't have<br>the rank, next I doubt you would have the physical ability to endure lastly<br>as you are from SRJC, I doubt you have the capabilities.<br><br>Lastly, charge, extra duties and confinements are very common among NS MEN.<br>In fact it is very easy to get these punishments. So I don't understand why<br>you are saying, I can't punish you. Try complaining in the army and see what<br>happen. Wow, are you thinking about downgrading, I think you better not,<br>becos I do not want to have a friend that wanted to escape reservist by<br>downgrading WHERE ARE YOUR BALLS.<br><br>I find it insulting and time consuming actually to be talking to you. Yet<br>there are some facts which I wish to highlight to you.<br>1. I am an officer while you are not<br>2. You may not be as successful as what you think<br>3. You can't escape the fact of having reservist unless YOU HAVE NO BALLS.<br>4. I do not wish to say this again I am an officer while you are NOT. This<br>is already the fact which can't be changed.<br>Yet what you had told me all the while was only what you intend to do but<br>not exactly the fact.<br><br>I certainly hope that you must accept the fact that I am an officer and you<br>are not. So what if I am a NS man, THE FACT IS MY RANK IS HIGHER THEN YOURS.<br>Be in army for so long even for people from Yishun Junior College they<br>should be able to understand that rank counts in the army so I see no reason<br>for someone from SRJC not to understand it.<br><br>Regards Denan<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>HA HA HA!!! Devan, so sad that you need the army to have self-confidence. Without it, what are you? There are certain people who are very well suited to the army. They need it for their own self-confidence. They need rank to know who and what they are. Army is good for this kind of people.<br><br>In Singapore, the rule of law is by civilians. Civilians hold the power, civilians control the army. Army is to serve the people, not the other way round. So Devan, I think you'd better migrate to maybe North Korea, Pakistan, or any country that is ruled by the military. In those countries, yes, rank and being in the army is very important! But here, where the rule of law is by civilians, your attitude just doesn't work, HA HA HA!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
