We focused on the owner because it was stupid to leave it unsecured.<br><br>The punishment should also depend on what the kid did while tapping into the connection. It depends on whether anything is 'stolen'. If he's just surfing the web, then nothing important is actually 'stolen' only the bandwith. He is just then trespassing which means he sees ur house open and  used the toilet. He didn't really steal anything except the water he used to flush. U want to prevent him from using ur toilet, then lock ur door. No harm is done.You don't need to call the police when there's nothing to 'recover' unless you really wanna recover the flushed water, then I really dunno what to say. Jail for using toilet suckslah.<br><br>If he looked through private information or did something malicious then you can consider that something has been 'stolen' or 'vandalised'. Anyway, the report suckslah...it's lacking in detail. </div></blockquote>As said, nothing in the report states whether the owner secured it. If it's secured and the kid went in, he would still be charged under Computer Misuse Act Section 6.</div>
