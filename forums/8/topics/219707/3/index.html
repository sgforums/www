I said that it would still have been wrong of the boy to do what he did even if the neighbour didn't encrypt his network. To quote my own words:<br><br><blockquote><strong>I mean, it would still be wrong of the boy to steal the network if the neighbour didn't encrypt it.</strong></blockquote>I was just wondering whether the neighbour had taken reasonable steps to encrypt his network and prevent unwanted intrusions. While it would still have been wrong of a thief to steal an unguarded wallet (and he indeed should be punished), the owner should have taken steps to safeguard it in the first place.<br><br>I'm not condoning what the boy did; I'm just asking if any reasonable safeguards were put in place by the neighbour.</div>
