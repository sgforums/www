            <div class='col-md body'>The crusades, the spanish inquisition,salem witch trials, the european wars of religion,nobody denies that these things happened. Men have definately used the name of God to kill and massacre. But why not look at it from another prespective. Look at how religion has inspired many. Look at Mother Teresa. Do you think she would have done the things she did without religion?Look at Florence Nightingale, Do you think she would gone all the way to the Crimea without her Catholic background? On a more local scale, look at the Salvation Army. Look at the TOUCH Community Services, one of the largest charities in Singapore, charity arm of FCBC. I don't deny that men have done evil deeds in the name of God but have a more balanced view of situation.</div>
