But in a few years, as it develops more of its own degree courses, its intake will be 2,000.<br><br>Modelled on open university programmes around the world, including those in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong, it will cater to working adults who want to study part-time to upgrade their qualifications to a degree.<br><br>As is the case with the courses SIM runs in collaboration with the UK's Open University, the students will learn at their own pace, studying online as well as by attending lectures and tutorials in the evenings at SIM's sprawling campus in Clementi Road.<br><br>The new university will offer a range of degrees, including arts and social sciences, business, computer science, biomedical engineering and tourism management.<br><br>Education Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam, who announced the set-up of the university in an addendum to the President's Address, said the new SIM University would add to the diverse university landscape already developing in Singapore.<br><br>He said the university 'will provide greater opportunities for working adults who are keen to acquire new skills and knowledge...'<br><br>SIM, with 10 years' experience running British Open University degree programmes, has so far graduated 4,500 students, one-third of whom are teachers.<br><br>Students have between four and eight years to complete the degree programme, although most complete it as quickly as they can.<br><br>Tuition fees will not be subsidised by the Government; but the fees, amounting to about $21,000 for the whole course, are similar to what other local university students pay over four years.<br><br>In the first few years, students will have the option of receiving a British Open University degree or the SIM University degree. But once the university has developed its own courses, the degrees will carry the SIM name.<br><br>Professor Cham Tao Soon, the former president of Nanyang Technological University who has been named chairman-designate of the SIM University Board of Trustees, said he is not losing any sleep over whether the degrees will be recognised by employers.<br><br>'People know the Government sets high standards. It wouldn't grant SIM University degree-awarding status if it wasn't confident of the standards,' he said.<br><br>In his addendum to the President's Address, Mr Tharman spoke on the plan by his ministry to introduce greater choice and flexibility.<br><br>The new A-level curriculum which will be offered from next year, the wider choice of subjects for Normal stream students, and the specialised secondary schools, have all opened up the choices for young Singaporeans to discover where their talents lie.<br><br>He said his ministry would build on these initiatives.<br><br>Working Singaporeans interviewed yesterday welcomed the new set up.<br><br>Mr Raja Selvam, 44, a supervisor in an IT company, said: 'SIM is already unofficially known as Singapore's fourth university and the second-chance university. It is appropriate for it to be granted official status.'</div>
