              <p>Does Botox get into the brain? Troubling research contradicts earlier findings about the treatment.</p>
              </div>
              <p>The
              way it usually works is, the rats and mice die first. Or at least get
              sick first. Or at the very least, show some adverse effect first—as in,
              before people do. The reason countless lab animals have given their
              lives during the testing of experimental drugs is to allow
              manufacturers and regulators to see that a compound might be toxic,
              even deadly, before millions of people use it. And if the compound does
              look a little dodgy, the lab-animal tests uncover the reason—how the
              compound affects the liver, say, or reaches the brain. Not
              surprisingly, these "preclinical tests" (that is, those performed
              before testing on humans) were especially rigorous for botulinum. One
              of the deadliest poisons in nature and a possible bioterrorism agent,
              this neurotoxin reached the market, in very dilute doses, starting in
              1989 as Botox. A big reason Botox and its cousins, such as Myobloc,
              were OK'd was that preclinical testing showed that after being
              injected, they did not travel along the body's highways—nerve cells—to
              the brain and spinal cord. Yes, there was some evidence the toxin
              slipped into the bloodstream or the lymph system, but Botox in the
              bloodstream cannot enter the brain, says its manufacturer.</p>
              <p>Oops.
              In a reversal of the usual sequence in science, researchers have
              discovered, after millions of people have received the drug, something
              fundamental about how Botox can act. Contrary to what turned up in
              preclinical testing, botulinum toxin can travel along neurons from the
              injection site into the brain, at least in lab animals. Researchers at
              Italy's Institute of Neuroscience injected rats and mice with botulinum
              neurotoxin A in doses comparable to those used in people. (Strains are
              named A, B and E, depending on where the common soil bacteria that
              produce them live; A is Botox, B is Myobloc, which is used for severe
              back pain.) Neurons at the injection site—the whisker muscles—absorbed
              some of the toxin and passed it along to other neurons they connected
              to, the researchers report this month in The Journal of Neuroscience.
              Within three days, the toxin had migrated from the whisker muscles to
              the brainstem, where it disrupted neuronal activity. "The discovery was
              quite serendipitous ... and surprising," Matteo Caleo, who led the
              study, told the journal Science. "A significant portion of the toxin is
              active where it's not intended to be."</p>
              <p>That stands in
              contrast to the findings of earlier studies, which suggested that the
              neurotoxin is completely broken down at the injection site into
              innocuous compounds and does not migrate beyond it—or if it does, only
              into the bloodstream or lymph system. Botox's manufacturer, Allergan,
              thinks those older studies are more credible. "This study is not
              conclusive," says spokesperson Cathy Taylor, "and other published
              studies using botulinum toxin type A contradict these findings."
              Contrary to Allergan's statement that the Italian scientists "injected
              the material directly into the brain," however, they injected the
              neurotoxin into facial muscles—and from there it found its way to the
              brainstem. "This is a new pathway, and we need to think about the
              implications of this," says Edgar Salazar-Grueso, chief medical officer
              of Solstice Neurosciences, which makes Myobloc. The new study, he says,
              means the original preclinical testing of Botox and its cousins "can be
              interpreted in a different light."</p>
              <p>Something else that
              can be seen in a different light is the hospitalizations and deaths
              that have been reported following Botox injections. In 2005 scientists
              at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration analyzed 1,437 such "adverse
              events" between 1989, when Botox was approved for eye spasms, and 2003.
              Most came from people who got Botox to erase their wrinkles, but the 28
              deaths occurred in people who had received it for medical purposes. The
              FDA didn't do much in response, but since then it has been getting new
              reports of serious adverse reactions in people receiving Botox, and
              launched a safety review. An analysis of the FDA's database by the
              advocacy group Public Citizen found 16 deaths from Botox or Myobloc.
              Most involved children with serious diseases like cerebral palsy, who
              got the injections for muscle spasms (an unapproved, though legal,
              use). But the agency has "evidence that [serious reactions and even
              death] can happen in a broader population," said the FDA's Russell
              Katz. "Is it possible with cosmetic use? Possibly."</p>
              <p>Those
              unapproved uses are another concern of the agency. Last month Allergan
              revealed that federal prosecutors were investigating it for promoting
              the non-FDA-approved use of Botox for headaches, though doctors are
              free to prescribe a drug as they see fit. Allergan says it's
              cooperating.</p>
              <p>Botox and Myobloc carry labels warning of
              possible adverse reactions near the injection site such as drooping
              eyelids, and of severe difficulty swallowing in patients with
              neuromuscular disorders. The FDA's Katz said that people getting Botox
              for cosmetic reasons should "make their own personal best judgment
              about this" and "be aware that there's the potential for" the
              neurotoxin to spread. With the new evidence that Botox can spread to
              the brain in ways that preclinical tests failed to turn up, it's enough
              to bring back those Botox-erased frown lines.</p>
