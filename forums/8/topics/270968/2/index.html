            <div class='col-md body'><br>I take up your challenge.<br><br>* Let's say (hypothetically) there is a bullet, which can shoot through any barrier. Let's say there is also an absolutely bullet-proof armour, and nothing gets through it. What will happen, if such bullet hits such armour?<br><br>1. Either the bullet cease to become a bullet by going beyond or the armor ceases to become armour by going beyond.<br><br>* Can a man drown in the fountain of eternal life?<br><br>2. Eternal life is not invincibilitiy but immortality. Immortality means that you will live forever if you arent destroyed. Invincibility is way beyond man.<br><br>* Your mission is to not accept the mission. Do you accept?<br><br>3.   Yes I don't .<br><br>* This girl goes into the past and kills her Grandmother. Since her Grandmother is dead the girl was never born, if she was never born she never killed her grandmother and she was born.<br><br>4. Therefore going back to the past is impossible. (: Scientists now acknowledge this.<br><br>* If the temperature this morning is 0 degrees and the Weather Channel says, "it will be twice as cold tomorrow,".... What will the temperature be?<br><br>5. 0 degrees celsius is 273.15 kelvins, therefore twice as cold is 136.575 kelvins<br><br>* Answer truthfully (yes or no) to the following question: Will the next word you say be no?<br><br>6. "truthfully (yes or no)"<br><br>* What happens if you are in a car going the speed of light and you turn your headlights on?<br><br>7. Doesnt matter if your headlights are on, you're gonna crash into something real soon.<br><br>* Let the God Almighty create a stone, which he can not pick up!<br><br>8. Let the Immortal God become mortal and die for the mortals He loves so much, that mortal can become immortal, He's already done it. No issue with the stone!<br><br>Now, i issue you a challenge.<br><br>1. I have an infinite number of chairs, each with one person on it. Now, I have an infinite number of customers coming who wants to sit on the chairs. How do I seat all my customers?<br><br>2. Very possible in the future, you die. Your grandparents are alive then because of advances in cloning and bring you back through cloning. But one day you meet your grandchildren and they tell you they also brought you back through cloning. Then you meet your clone. Which one is you?<br><br>3. I have an ordinary light switch connected to a light. When the switch is closed, the light is on. When the switch is open, the light is off. At two minutes to noon, the light is on. At one minute to noon I flip the switch, turning the light off. At half a minute to noon I flip it again, turning the light on. At a quarter of a minute before noon I flip it again, turning the light off. I continue in this way, cutting the time between flippings of the switch in half each time. Now this will be an infinite series of flips. The switch flippings will occur closer and closer to noon, but will all be completed before noon. Will the switch be on or off at noon?<br><br>4. One day the professor came into the class and announced, "Next week I will give you a surprise test. It will be a surprise, because you won't be able to figure out on which day it will occur until the class meets on the day of the test. It could happen on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday, but I won't tell you which day." The class were clever. They reasoned as follows: "She can't give the test on Friday, because then it wouldn't be a surprise; we'd know after class on Thursday that the test hadn't yet occurred, and hence we'd figure out that it would have to be on Friday. So we know the test can't be on Friday. But then it can't be on Thursday either, because if it were, we would know after class on Wednesday that it would have to be on Thursday, since it wouldn't have happened yet, and we have already shown that it can't be on Friday." Reasoning in this manner, the students concluded that the test could not occur on Wednesday either, nor on Tuesday, nor on Monday. Having concluded that a surprise test was impossible, the students didn't study. They were very disappointed and very surprised on Wednesday when they got a test. Where did the students' reasoning go wrong?<br><br></div>
