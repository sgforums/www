            <div class='col-md body'>Well seems it's a interesting topic to be discussed.<br><br>Actually I would like to quote this word, "Kiasu", to describe BOTH SINGAPOREAN AND PRCs. This is bacause we came from the same root, just that grew in the diff environments. Maybe it is the common identity that can be found in these two groups of Chinese, in fact all the Chinese around the world.<br><br>I dont know if you are 3rd 4th or even 6th gen of Chinese Singaporean, but one thing that I am very very sure that is, sometimes you may think your father or grandfather's behaviours and habits are totally unacceptable to you.<br><br>WHY?<br><br>It is the reflections of diff in cultures, level of education, and environments.<br><br>Back to this issue, I do agree with you that some PRCs do not wish to queue up, and it is obvious. However, how many of you've noticed that actually Singaporeans' driving manner is also quite aggressive? Certainly not all but partially. Aren't the two cases the same?<br><br>I bet you have already seen hell lots of the ugly sides of Singpaoreans, but under this culture, this environment, this kind of education system. Everything seems to be just fine. Sometimes foreigners dont understand why we have to queue up for donuts for hours, isnt it strange? Ask yourself.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The peoples of the Chinese diaspora exhibits many different behaviors, reflecting the diversity of the Chinese people and their geographical extent. To attribute certain traits to someone of Chinese descent based only on his race is quite racist. It is quite popular to say Chinese are like this or Chinese are like that but such sloganeering is often a matter of propaganda to achieve a certain political outcome. If anything is common in the Chinese people, it is only the tendency to be able to speak Mandarin and have asiatic features, although to these too there are exceptions.<br></div>

This is bacause we came from the same root, just that grew in the diff environments. Maybe it is the common identity that can be found in these two groups of Chinese, in fact all the Chinese around the world.<br><br>I dont know if you are 3rd 4th or even 6th gen of Chinese Singaporean, but one thing that I am very very sure that is, sometimes you may think your father or grandfather's behaviours and habits are totally unacceptable to you.<br><br>WHY?<br><br>It is the reflections of diff in cultures, level of education, and environments.<br><br>Back to this issue, I do agree with you that some PRCs do not wish to queue up, and it is obvious. However, how many of you've noticed that actually Singaporeans' driving manner is also quite aggressive? Certainly not all but partially. Aren't the two cases the same?<br><br>I bet you have already seen hell lots of the ugly sides of Singpaoreans, but under this culture, this environment, this kind of education system. Everything seems to be just fine. Sometimes foreigners dont understand why we have to queue up for donuts for hours, isnt it strange? Ask yourself.</div></blockquote>They are in Singapore now.<br>Learn Singapore culture.<br>Learn Singapore rule.<br>Do things that a Singaporean will feel normal enough...<br>We might be strange to others, but still, what is more important is that we live in harmony here in Singapore. Doing what other's feel strange together...<br>Unity is the word...<br><br>Don't tell that they can't change...<br>If not, they won't be able to follow Singapore Law...<br>I'm sure there are a bit of differences in their Law and ours...<br><br>And... A small percent of Singaporeans are too like them...</div>
