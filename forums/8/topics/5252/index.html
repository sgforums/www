            <div class='col-md body'>hi, was writing the chinese culture thingy... and along the way of writing, another issue pop up in my topic, which I decides to post as another new topic in order not to distract.<br><br>many S'poreans(most of my frens are chinese, and frens fm other race hv never done it infront of me!) seems to be looking down on native chinese working in s'pore... which in my opinion, is getting a bit out of hand... like "eh... that guy fm China ah... eeeee...." stuff like that, which makes me a bit sad, cos they are your own race... and you're looking down on your own people...<br><br>Or these people are more nationalist in outlook and also say "eee...." on other foreign workers (indians, blangadeshis, etc) also... why dun these people say "eeee... ang-mohs ah...."? Are they looking down on themselves as asians? I know europeans and americans are more affluent and thus will not be "unwelcome" so to say, but lets put it this way... those less educated people are here to build your buildings, do the work that s'poreans do not want to do, and you r discriminating them?<br><br>While I'm someone who loves chinese culture very much, I'm not a racist person in the sense that I like to talk to people fm other races and learn about their culture, history, politics, etc...  hv not talked to europeans and americans on such topics, but did talk to some myanmans(or burmese), thais, indians and blangadeshis... u may wonder why I get to see these people, well, I live in near industrial estates...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I do admit though that I'm more comfortable dealing with chinese due to the language factor. I'm not very good in english lah....<br><br>I know my post is going to be a bit controversial, but what I want is just pure and friendly discussions, not flaming like some people are doing in the forum, and seems like chief hv started claming down by locking those posts... thks chief!<br><br>------------------<br>Whens the end coming?

            <div class='col-md body'>I also have friends like Bochup's....making discriminating comments about Bangadash or Chinese immigrants....actually I dunno why they have to discriminate between people...regardless of whether he/she is a Singaporean Chinese,Singaporean Malay,Singaporean Indian,China immigrant,Indian Immigrant,etc.....All are human wat....The only difference is that we lucky..born in Singapore....U see those Filipino maids....16..17..18 yrs old already come all the way here to work as maids...some even have diplomas/degrees from their country of orgin....True..they work as maids here..but are they any less intelligent or less hardworking than us?...Nope...I personally dun think so...it's just the place that they happened to be born..that working as a maid in a foreign country becomes a course of action for them....<br><br>In retrospect...when we were about their age(late teens)....wat kind of lives were we leading?....Maybe as singaporeans,we enjoy too much from the fruits of economic success that we have became less tolerant towards other races....<br><br>------------------<br><br>Action may not always bring happiness, but there is no happiness without action.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Ah-BLuR (edited 06-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i would say quite a number of singapoeans are guilty of making racist remarks/acts (including myself).<br><br>jus take any bus that passes through Little India during weekends and u'll see pp slaming their bags on the empty seats besides them jus when a Blangdesh worker is about to sit; pp explicitly pinching their noses whenever a Blangdeshi walks past or parents talking ill (expletives included sometimes) of these foreign workers in front of their children...the list goes on.<br><br>funnie, always hear pp saying NS will make one more tolerant of other races. dunno about u guys but i find that quite a no. of my army friends become more racist after NS (maybe we didn't have much contact with other races - almost all are Chinese).<br><br>sad.<br><br>[This message has been edited by stranger (edited 06-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'll admit that I'm biased against some races. My experiences with them in the past made me think that most of them act in the way that they do, and when I don't like that, I develope the thinking that they are all like that. I guess you can say that thats steorotyping.<br><br>It takes an effort on my part to not to revert to any of my preconceptions of people from different countries. Take HK people FOR EXAMPLE. I have an idea of how they act. Doesn't matter if its right or wrong, but the majority of my experience with them, limited as it is, gave me the impression that all of them are like that. Of course, when I got to know some of them better, my ideas of that particular person change, but my impression of HK people as a whole still remains. It doesn't help if the majority of HK people act like the way I think they should act.<br><br>I do agree that living free of want makes us look down on people who have to struggle to live, especially when they work so close to us. I can only say that my impressions can change once I get to know them, and I am willing to change my view on them. That doesn't mean that they are all pleasant. Its like saying that all Singaporeans are pleasant.<br><br>So, I guess the bottom line is, I'll try to treat everyone individually and don't jump to conclusions.</div>
