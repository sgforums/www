            <div class='col-md body'>they shldnt have the final say<br>but we shd take their opinions into account...cos when u marry ur eventual wife, she's gonna be part of the family, and it wld be awkward if they cant get along. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm, most of the time, our parents do have very legimitate concerns about who we marry, they're afraid it may be the wrong person and what so ever.<br><br>I think the balanced approach here is not to ignore their advice or just give them a "few says", but to work out those concerns with them cooperatively along with your prospective mate, to allow both sides to have a better understanding of each other.<br><br>Of course, in cases where parents dun agree becos of not really rational reasons like race and stuff like that, that'll be a harder sticking point. But I dun think most parents are like that. After all, they dun wan you to marry a useless good for nothing bum who gambles and take your money.</div>
