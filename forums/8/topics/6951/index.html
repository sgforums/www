            <div class='col-md body'>Ok....I dun have much experience with dirty dancing, for there are not many females who would dance dirty with me...*laffs* but what ever experience I have, is too wonderful to forget.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> And I been wondering if I should share my experinece for it would destroy what ever image I have left. *laffs* But then again what the heck!<br><br>Last year, I was at Studio East, went there with 2 friends, and met a long lost secondary school friend who have went to Hong Kong for many years. She came back to Singapore for a Holiday. Anyway, we had a few drinks, and she was a little high, and the song "Horny" was playing. The dance floor for studio east is pretty big, and there ain't much  crowd. So we were swinging to the music, and suddenly I felt like dancing, really dance...then the DJ, was asking people to dance "Horny". *laffs* So I asked if she mind, and she gracefully put her hands around me and sportingly said "Show me!" Wow, what an intense stare she was holding, I can still recall... Anyway, I pull her by the waist and hold her close...I smell her hair, my hands move....to almost every inch of her bare skin...she even lick my fingers...<strong>WOW hot!</strong>....she is good...I turn her around suddenly and with a bit of force, I am holding her by her waist with her back to me with one hand, and holding her shoulder with another...while moving up and down to the music...she threw her head backwards and showed me a creamy fair neck, my instincts told me to go ahead and bite! but I resisted, and only nibble on her ear...I can feel her melting man! *laffs* She lead my hands to her thigns...smooth...by then I think she is very very high.....cos she suddenly turned around, trap me by jumping up and wrapping her legs around me, and french kissed me...ok...it was only for something like 10 15 seconds...but the kiss was still there...  :p *laffs* then the song ended soon... If I am not wrong, I was too surprised to recall anything after that from her... *lol*<br><br>WOW....my friends were thinking that I'll be laid by her  that night...*laffs* but nah....we both laughed it off and the 2 of us were blsuhing after that... I think it is her first time dancing like that but one thing for sure...we truly enjoyed ourself.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Ok so much for the ego trip...but frankly it was a great experience....but I suppose you got to have the chance to meet a sporting partner and one who is wild enough too. If he/she can lead you, then it would be a lot easier for first timers. Well hope you all have fun and the chance to do it...for it is really great!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>good one there Callan...<br><br>I dirty dance a few times wif some chiong frenz but non as intimate as urs..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I mus say it is really more of a "spur of the moment" kind of dance for mi... like u hear the music and jus feel like dancing and u see her and next thing u know u are dirty dancing.. I still wonder how I ever got the courage to do such dance... I guess when u are high, nuttin can stop u... hehee<br><br>But I mus say its a wonderful feeling, I consider it a way to express myself.. thru the dance..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i tried (or rather "we) tried it at a chalet last year...with the portable cd player blasting at full volume...it was not THAT intimate (refer to callan) but it was definitely "dirty" (hiaK~...i spare the details...) then me and him tripped over the rug and fell onto the bed...and we laughed so hard that it was impossible to continue (with the dancing of cos)...</div>
