            <div class='col-md body'>Why marry just coz your girlfriend's pregnant? WHy should we conform to society? If we are not ready for marriage and the girl is pregnant, a couple can still have the child and lead normal lives. As and when the couple feels strongly that it is time to make that commitment, marriage comes into play. Issit just our asian society of 'mian zi' and family honouring that couples have to 'force' themselves to get married?<br><br>This is just a frank opinion.....feel free to comment.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think that being committed to another will ensure commitment towards the upbringing of the kid.  There are instances of couples who hates each other and would tear each other apart but they love their kids to death.<br><br>Divorce rates are so high.  Every minute, there's a divorce case.  THe child suffers more than the parents themselves who are going through the divorce.  Wouldn't it be just kind to the child to let him know that there's a mummy and a daddy for him/her but mummy &amp; daddy's not married?<br><br>No doubt that being in a nuclear family with papa and mama would be nice.  But if the couple is not sure about marriage, it would save a lot of heartaches, pain and infidelity.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  Hence, a pregnancy should not be the be-all &amp; end-all reason for the couple to get married.  It's the worsssst excuse in the whole entire world.<br><br>Enigma:  YES....I do agree that protection must be taken to prevent this unforseen mishap, but accidents do happen, don't they?  It's no use crying over split milk.

That they hope to make up for their mistake by kinda "forcing" things to turn out the normal way and of cuz there will be cases where this works.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think I've mentioned something like this before, that I truly believe that having your dad and mom living under the same roof doesn't necessarily make an ideal, happy family. What matters most in any family is love, whether it's that from a single parent or both parents. And if you don't have that, just remember to love yourself as an individual and not waste away just because you think no one cares.<br><br>Having a child is never meant to be a fun-filled, trivial affair and all that is clearly emphasised in the labour of childbirth. Before you actually have a baby, you'll have to ask, if you're financially stable, if you're ready for it, and is your partner ready for it, mentally and spiritually, whether or not you're engaged or married. You'll have to clearly weigh the pros and the cons, to understand your circumstances and be wary of the consequences, even though you may be the compassionate softie who believes that ridding of the growing foetus equals killing off a part of you.<br><br>Then there is the question of social ethics. But would you rather have a child out of wedlock, or to deprive an innocent life a chance to live out in this world? Which is the lesser of two evils? Would your rather bear the brunt of gossip or suffer the backbreaking guilt of killing your own flesh and blood? Of course, the ultimate ethical advice is not to get yourself pregnant until you're married. But that's certainly not the kind of preaching you'd like to hear if you happen already to have that little life in you. I'd say, if you love your child, if you're financially stable, if you're ready for it, just go for it. And it's good if you have a boyfriend who still cares for you. If he's the one rushing through the marriage plans, consider yourself blessed. And if you get ditched, go on, shed your tears. But life still goes on and that little life in you needs to go on. If it's anything you should be wiser now.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>You really can't stop tongues from wagging. And if a couple gets married just so they can avoid verbal lashings is going to be grievously disappointed. People are still going to talk about you. I mean you could've done some other things, bad things, and you'd still get people talking about you. Why bother? Is reputation all that matters? Certainly not. It's happiness. And if you decide you're going to be sad just because you're on the tip of everyone's tongue, you're going to have a hard time pleasing the whole world, 'cos you can never please everyone all the time.<br><br>Of course this may seem like bullshit to you, like you heard it a million times and that the bitter, blatant and prevailing truth is that everyone cares about their reputation you know... but try to get an alternative viewpoint, reach out beyond the superficial. If you don't care, that's when you realise there are people who don't care either and they live much happier lives. They got lambasted, were terribly misconstrued but they knew better not to build their hopes and dreams on what others think of them, and when they got dissed and flamed, it's only a matter of getting used to. They did not see themselves as mutants, as fools as a disgrace, just because of what people say or think about them. Different yes, but never warped, inferior or undeserving of a life. Almost like a curse, there's always this temptation to really be full of ourselves, to prove ourselves and conform to other people's expectations. But you'll never know -- your most critical opponents may just conform to your expectations just because you believe strongly in who you are -- that just 'cos if you're an outcast doesn't mean you don't belong to society. That wields power and respect, more than you can ever wish for if you were mindlessly copying from others the way to handle unplanned pregnancies, et al. If the Manchus, considered barbaric by the Han Chinese, can make half a billion of their southern neighbours wear pigtails, you can jolly well do something out of the blue, get condemned, and eventually get accepted by the same people who damned you to their last breath, at the first place.<br><br>Uhm ok, blabbered enough... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>------------------<br>J A S O N N E X<br>http://jasonnex.cjb.net</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well said Jasonnex. Speaking for myself though, I'd love to be able to say that I am my own master and I make my own decisions. I'd love to be able to declare that I don't care what other people think. But if I know myself, some part of me would not be able to confidently say that, because its not just conformity towards your social circle or even society, it also has to do with a sense of belonging.<br><br>Maybe I'm reading too much into the topic. It does indeed seem stupid to make your decision based on what others think rather than what you think, but I think in some cases the need to have that sense of belonging is so bad that you don't do what you really want. Its not just "other people". Its your father, mother, friends who have been with you for years, relatives, brothers, sisters, cousins etc.<br><br>Still, you were right on about assessing the situation and then make a decision based on that. Its achieving the least destructive outome rather than the best outcome.<br><br>I have to disagree that bringing up a child involves love and nothing else. Its important, but if you are going to bring up a functional human being, love is neccessary but not enough. You also need a sensible and proper environment for the child to grow up with. Some people need another person around to help with that, some can handle on their own. I'm not infering that single parents are deficient compared to the traditional family. I'm saying not to be overconfident and think that bringing up someone by yourself is that romantic and easy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let's review what is a marriage.<br>Marriage is a commitment between 2 soul mates ( a man and a woman ), living together until death. This is a serious commitment and both parties must be willing to stand for and keep on loving each other in times of happiness and troubles.<br><br>Marriage also requires both soul mates to tender each other with lots of communication and affection and attention. Most marriages turn into divorce because ..... couples aren't as active as they used to be when they are still steads.<br><br>However, marriage due to have a child is like a forced marriage. And Adoption is definately like MURDER. So rather see if there is any couples who cannot concieve a child on their own and then pass the child to them.<br><br>If the world acts bochup , woe is the world.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Erm....guys, I'm NOT pregnant.<br><br>I do agree with you, Jason, that one would have to face inner turmoil when a situation like this arises.  To abort, or to adopt?  To marry or have the whole town talking about you?  To access the situation is the most rational thing that we can do since we're given the ability to rationalise.  However, if every single action is broken down to cause and consequences, we would be perfect to the point of being saints.<br><br>I would think that when a girl faces a situation like this, her homones would be surging and she probably can't think straight herself.  The first question would be:  Do I want the baby?  Then all else would not really matter to her.  What society's standard or yard stick should not play the slightest role of her decision.<br><br>Homosapiens are creatures of habit and they need to socialise.  To look upon their peers for advice and comfort and companionships.  However, that is all there is to it.  I'm not trying to change society as it is as such whereby people are just conforming to their own kind's rules and regulations.  However, if it is going to make them miserable, I pray for those who will eventually see the light that conformity is not what they want.  That's how psychos come about....repression.  Maybe I'm one.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>BTW, I'm not one of those rebels without a cause.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let's face it- whether you get married or not, people will still talk about you. The fact remains that you've had pre-marital sex and got caught for it in a conservative society that doesn't condone this.<br><br>If you don't marry, (1) your child will live the stigma of being a bastard (2) he/she may be deprived of the other parent<br><br>If you marry, (1)your marriage may break down in a couple of years because of the strain and/or you didn't each other well enuff b4 that (2) you may have to postpone your studies/career for the baby. You may not even finish Uni or have a career in the end.<br><br>There is no best solution.

            <div class='col-md body'>i would say that marriage isnt the only choice, but rather, an option. the smartest thing of course, is to practice safe sex, or the safest of all, masturbation.. doh. but, if your hormones are really raging, then be prepared for the possible consequences. if you really get pregnant, you can abort, put the kid up for adoption, or keep it.. but, if you choose to keep it, why cant you remain single? getting married wont solve everything. those "san gu liu po"s have enough fingers on both hands to count, everyone knows when it's a shotgun wedding. the older generation would say it's the "right" thing to do, morally, yes, but how many of us now, with SO, will actually want to get married to him/her? esp at such a young age when you barely know each other. you'll never truly know the guy(or girl) till he starts working.. cos that's as permanant as you'll ever get. shotgun weddings usually have disasterous results. most likely divorce. so why get married in the first place?<br><br>personally, if i can into such a situation, i would choose an abortion.<br><br>------------------<br>I believe in the sun, even when it is not shining.<br>I believe in love, even when i do not feel it.<br>I believe in God, even when He is silent.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Damn.. i thought this was a "resons not to get married" thread... anyway as mentioned in earlier posts, its a no win situation. I'm just wondering why araven insists that an abortion is not an option? There are two sides to every coin, and altho i admit that its cruel, if you think abt it, its even more cruel to bring a child into this world knowing full well that he/she will not be getting the most ideal family conditions/ love/attention/finances that a child is entitled to! If you decide on a shotgun marriage, have the baby and get a divorce 4 or 5 yrs down the road, think abt the trauma the child has to face! It has been shown that divorce has an adverse effect on children which can only be combatted if the parent he/she is living with makes the effort to create a "normal" family environment (i.e. love, care, communication) and we are talking about TEENAGERS here, teens who are still adjusting to hormonal imbalances, who can't even deal with their own emotions let alone the childs!! Its quite ridiculous to say "lets get married and sort things out" cos you have to be sorted out before you take the plunge to get married. Its a lifetime commitment cheapened and trivialized by the ease of divorce! what i think: Don't marry!<br><br>so araven, please do realize that i repect your pro-life stand on the issue of abortion, but a zealot approach to this is hardly desirable, because as i've mentioned, there is always two sides to the coin, and abortion does not necessarily equate to murder.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i totally agree with Ms.Suess.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> though i understand your prolife attitude towards abortion, and RESPECT your decision and views, please do not simply condemn everyone else who does not share the same point of view.<br><br>these are young kids we're talking about here. immature teen-agers who can barely take care of themselves, let alone be responsible for another life! i dont see the point in having a shotgun wedding, unless you're prepared to face the consequences. which is, that such weddings usually end in divorce. is that really helpful? "oh let's get married then the kid can have a 'name'. job done, duty's over... tata!" why bring an innocent life into the quarrel? if anyone did anything wrong, it's the two of you. don't drag the baby down as well.<br><br>abortion should be an option, and it is. in the end, it's still the mother's call. if she wants to have a baby, go ahead. if she doesnt want to get married, that's ok. if she wants to put the baby up for adoption, it's up to her. and if she wants an abortion, IT'S HER RIGHT.<br><br>------------------<br>I believe in the sun, even when it is not shining.<br>I believe in love, even when i do not feel it.<br>I believe in God, even when He is silent.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Boy it's really scary to see a pro-life activist or supporter here...Not that 'm blasting you Araven but Msseus and Atax have very valid and logical points...Being a zealot and fundamentalist won't help anyone at all...not the kid or the parents...<br><br>It's all so scary because it's the Pro-life people who are going around killing other people and doctors by assasination and mail bombs and preying on other people and bringing in a reign of terrror to normal folks...doesn't sound very pro-life to me...so you see how dangerous being too commited to something is? Kind of blinding...:-)<br><br>Anyway, most teens who get pregnant don't have the ability to carry out any kind of duty that is required of them.  If abortion isn't kept as an option, then you most probably effectively destroy 3 lives if not more...they get ostracised, gossiped about, shunned, etc...etc...and give up for adoption?...unless it's really necessary like when the parents are shown to be extremely negligent, adoption is basically an abortion in life form...Let me just say that Adopted children usually grow up really ill adjusted and disturbed... mosty are a menace to themselves and to society...Speaking from my knowledge of overseas adoption...dunn know much about here...<br><br>It's as good as saying I'll do my deed, then pass the responsibilty on to someone else...dun care how he/she is raised as long as I dun have to....very base and cruel if you think about it....Like abortion, it should be klept as a last resort...so eliminating choices is as good as saying everyone owes you money so they must do what you say...people have their own lives to live and their choice....I hate people trying to tell me how to live my life...It's always so easy to tell someone when You're not in their shoes....(sorry Araven, I'm not directing this at you....sorry I didn't make it clear above...)<br><br>And how about those mothers who don't abort and dump their babies in rubbish bins or on stair cases...the price you pay for not aborting...either way you lose a life, but what way is up to those involved...not me and not anyone else who wasn't in the same room with them while they were "pro-creating!"...<br><br>the most feared choices for a couple:<br><br>1. Abort and have the death on your conscience all your life....<br><br>2. Carry on and have the baby so that your conscience can feel beter....then pass the responsibilty on to someone else...(I think this is worse because you take even less responsibilty than aborting and some more you do it only to clear conscience...poor baby whoever it may be whose parents dun want them...)<br><br>Aiyah...that was the short version lah...can write on and on on this subject but cannot eh...sleepy already...sorry if not elaborated enuff...if want to flame , then flame...:-)</div>
