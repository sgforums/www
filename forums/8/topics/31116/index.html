            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Question:</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Hi Callan,<br><br>I got myself a new r/s , but I still got e feeling of having both "ex" n "current".<br><br>...... but I only can have 1 ONLY !!<br>i dun which to lose my current r/s:love:  &amp; i wish to have my "ex" back. :shock:<br><br>this have been bother mi for quite long.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br></span><br><br><strong>Answer:</strong><br><br>Dear XXXXXX,<br><br>Well...sorry for such a late reply, been very busy with other aspects of work and I really do apologise to all whom I have yet to reply to.<br><br>Well, rather than saying what's right and what's wrong about the whole situation, maybe I should share my experiences.<br><br>Let me tell you 2 stories from both sides...first a woman who still have feelings for hier ex and the other the ex-bf facing his ex who already have a new boyfriend who still have feelings for him.<br><br><strong>1) Familarity Breeds complexity</strong><br><br>A friend of mine who is a lady, broke up with her bf because of personality differences and maybe because of a new guy in her life whom she is rather attracted to. The bf made no attempt to make the girl stay feeling that she might be happier with the new guy, since she did tell him about it. Soon after she broke up with the bf, she went into a new relationship with this new guy, and they started out happy, him having similiar personailty with her and feeling very fresh in the new r/s. But 1 month into this new r/s she call up her ex-bf and decided to ask him out for a coffee session. And after that short 2 hour session, she realised that she still have feeligns for him, and similiar to you she started to call him more often uncontrollably. And soon enough she is having thoughts of going back to the old bf because she felt that things can still be worked out between them. But here she is stuck with her current bf whom she is still very much in love with. On one hand she would like to try out with her ex again because they have been together and she knows the problems they have and the solutions to make it work or rather that might make it work and she does feel happy when thing are workign well between in fact happier than with the current one. On the other hand, she is in a perfectly ok relationship with the present boyfriend and there is no reason other than the fact that she could be happier with the ex IF things work out. It is very much like a gamble, between buying something familiar and trying out something new. She was in this state for about 3 months, and it was torturous for all 3, as she did hint to her current bf about such feelings she has for the ex and she also did tell the ex that she stills loves him. and they are all not young, All in their mid 20s. In the end, she was more or less enlighten, she realised that if she is to go back to the ex, the same problems will arise again and though the solution is there it might not work and even if it work it might not be too permanent. And if she is to stay in this new r/s, she also realised that the r/s being so young will need fostering and through this fosterign though it might fail or it might suceed, the r/s might also turn out to be more successful than the previous one.<br><br>Thus the result of going back to the ex is just as unpredictable as staying with her current one. With only one exception, the chance of success in the current r/s is very much undetermined than the previous one, knowing what she might go through again. In the end she decided to stay with the current one and move on, exploring the possiblities in this new r/s, because she has already given the pass r/s a chance and she got her answers, but if she is going to give up on this new r/s without even trying, she will have a big IF for the rest of her life and might live to regret it. It might sound absurd to compare the big IF in both r/s in this manner, but to be objective in such a complex situation, the only way to know is to try out.<br><br>Of course she did not meet the ex again until her emotions are more settled 1 yr later after she made that decision, as she also know, the reason for the delimma she is in, is very much self created. Had she not met the ex so soon after the breakup where feelings for each other are still strong, she would not have faced something like that in the first place.<br><br><strong>2) The sting of a indecisive woman</strong><br><br>My friend broke up with his gf due to a very foolish reason which is not convinient for me to share, but because of that, the r/s ended with a comma rather than a full stop. Both sides still feel for each other, but the main problem here is that the girl is already with a new bf. The torments that my friend went through other than sleepless nights, is the commitment to a non-existing r/s. The 2 both knowing the feelings they still have for each other but the fact that the girl is again in a perfectly ok r/s makes things difficult for them to go back together. It would be against the views of all around them for the girl to dump the current bf when he is such a nice guy and to go back to my friend. She would most probably be branded a bitch, slut and a woman who cannot be committed by others, while my friend would have to carry the name of a gf snatcher and badass jerk should she actually do it.<br><br>The girl feels that she is doing something very unfair to the current bf as not only does she still loves my friend, there was a couple of times when the emotions got so intense between them that they actually made love. To look at the situation logically, they are definitely doing something wrong, but this is an emotional situation, and the complexity of emotions can't be explained by logic alone. The true fact here is that the 2 of them are suffering very much. Both having to answer to moral reponsibilties toward her current bf and the emotional responsibilities towards each other at the same time. The girl not knowing what to do, not having the courage to bear the unpleasanties of dunping her current nice guy bf for my friend secretly hopes that something will happen and give her an excusable reason to leave her current bf to go back to my friend. It was a very long wait, as there really isn't to complain about in the new guy. My friend tried to commit sucide facing this event in his life, unable to cope between morality that his surroundings demands and his own feelings towards his ex. He became a very depressed man. the whole thing lasted for close to 9 months. During which the current bf is still kept in the dark before my friend finally pluck up the corage to leave and start anew. It took him a long time to recover and started dating again. As for the girl, she tried to stay in the r/s with the current bf, but in the end she could not continue due to guilt and broke up with the guy 3 months later. The damage done to all 3 involved are great, all lost precious time, were emotionally strain and one even almost lost his life. The new guy till this day still does not know what happen and the reason the girl left him, and he is left with a big question mark till this day in his life.<br><br>Such situations are not uncommon in real life, as the truth is that we might not be with the person we love most all the time. If you are, you are lucky, but if you are not, society denotes that you are not suppose to be having feelings for another other than your bf or husband. This is very much a grey area that many people know exist but refuse to acknowledge the logic of it's existence. the courage needed to love in such situations is very killed by the views of others whom might have not experience the situation before or refuse to acknowledge their emotions when it happens to them. But then again they are not wrong...it takes a lot of strength and self-denial to face moral responsiblities sometimes. And i dun mean this as a sacastic remark, self-denial is something that is not easy. both actions requiring the quality of Courage and Commitment, with the difference of the situation.<br><br>Looking at the stories above, I'm not sure if you got what I'm trying to tell you. But maybe I can summarise. Right now, it is not a choice between 2 guys, but rather it is a choice of Courage and Commitment. The choice to have courage to try out a new r/s and the commitment towards your new boyfriend or the Courage to bear a bad name and try again and commitment to your choice so that you will not have a big IF.<br><br>I can't tell you what to do, since it's your life and I can't say which is right or wrong, since both seems so equal. But I can only tell you to make a decision fast, else the damage you are going to do would only increase in the long run.<br><br>Should you decide to breakup and go back, do it fast, least more hurt is done to your current bf as time past and he developes stong emotional attachment towards you. And should you decide to try out this new r/s, tell your ex fast too, and move away from him, so that he will not take so long to recover from the torturous wait.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
