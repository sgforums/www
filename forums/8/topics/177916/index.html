            <div class='col-md body'>Hi.. congrats in your better than expected results in your O levels. I was from NP.. In the engineering school.. From where i know about NP, their business sch in future prospects are better recognised in many private companies.<br><br>In NP, the competition is high. But if you make that cut, which is not easy, you will be able to be up there.. NYP if you wanna go in to business sch, I advice you to go into Business Management. It has a general business scope in year 1. You will only major in year 2 onwards.<br><br>Good luck <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ShuttleX:</div><div class="quote_body">I've got my O level results and i'm happy that they are better than what i expected.
