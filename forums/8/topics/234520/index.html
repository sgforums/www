            <div class='col-md body'>If u got the time to read on.... why people destroy their life so easily??? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>THE promise of fame and fortune was too much of a lure. The New Paper<br><br>Two women - a 27-year-old teacher and an 18-year-old ex-JC student - claimed they dated foreign-born footballers playing here.<br><br>The men wined and dined them, and sold them on fantasies of life as Wags, which is what wives and girlfriends of star footballers are called in England.<br><br>But no, they didn't become football tai-tais. The 18-year-old girl said she got pregnant, but had to abort the baby when her boyfriend refused to accept responsibility.<br><br>Now both women are coming out to warn the girls who, they say, swarm around these foreign players.<br><br>Sara, 18, called The New Paper on Sunday with her story. She said she dated three foreign players.<br><br>The men knew each other, and she claimed they passed her around.<br><br>Sara (not her real name) claimed it was her third boyfriend who made her pregnant. She said she kept her story a secret for over a year, as she didn't want her mother to find out all about it.<br><br>Sara, a plain-looking girl with a bubbly personality, said: 'It has been too much for me to handle. At first, I was angry, but I wasn't sure if I should talk about it.'<br><br>But why now?<br><br>STRANGE PHONE CALLS<br><br>Sara claimed she has been getting strange calls from men she thinks are other foreign players. She believes her number has been passed around.<br><br>'I just want it to stop,' she said. 'I know they are talking behind my back.'<br><br>She came for the interview at a fast-food outlet with a ex-JC classmate, who carried a newspaper with job listings circled in red. They're waiting for their A-level results.<br><br>Sara hopes to become a teacher.<br><br>She said she got to know the players through friends. She first met Michael (not his real name) at a 2004 Christmas barbecue in East Coast Park.<br><br>Michael - who is in his early 20s - had just arrived in Singapore.<br><br>For two weeks, Sara claimed he called to ask her out. Eventually she became friendly, not just with Michael, but a group that included several other foreign players and four local girls.<br><br>'I wanted to help them adapt to the culture here,' she said of the players.<br><br>The group often hung out together at kopitiams and at Sara's home. She was also there to cheer them at matches.<br><br>'They were not exactly celebrities,' she said. 'But they were cool and fun. A lot of girls were after them.'<br><br>The players claimed they were famous back home and invited her on overseas training trips, saying their clubs would take care of her. She never accepted.<br><br>She claimed they showered her with promises like, 'If you marry me, you'll have the chance to study and live overseas' and, 'If I make it to a bigger club in Europe, come with me'.<br><br>One wrote her a stack of love letters: 'Since the first day I saw you in Katong bus stop, I start like you. After talk together many times, I start love you...'<br><br>FLATTERING<br><br>For a teen, 'it was very flattering'.<br><br>Sara's mother is ill and her father is not around. Since she was young, all her close friends have been male.<br><br>'I lack paternal love. That's why I like the company of men,' she said.<br><br>The relationship grew. She said: 'As I got to know them better, I saw them as people, not as football stars.<br><br>Soon, the players were visiting her home every weekend, often staying till 3am. They even called Sara's mother 'mum' and even asked to marry Sara.<br><br>By March 2005, barely three months after she met them, Sara said her whole life 'practically revolved around them'.<br><br>One day, Michael and another player, Ben (not his real name), invited Sara to their rented HDB flat.<br><br>'We always visit you,' they said. 'Why can't you come to our place?'<br><br>She went alone one afternoon.<br><br>'I trusted them,' she said. She ended up being intimate with Ben, though she claimed she hadn't planned to.<br><br>Instead of leaving, she waited for Michael to return to relate the incident. And he became intimate with her too.<br><br>She left only the next morning. Though she denied she wanted to be intimate, Sara didn't make a police report. She said she didn't want her mother to know the truth.<br><br>That's when she confided in Patrick (not his real name), another foreign player. He helped her through the trauma, and soon they fell in love.<br><br>Their nine-month relationship was not easy. She said: 'I quarrelled with him a lot, telling him our relationship should not be just about sex. But he said that if I loved him, I should sleep with him.'<br><br>Then she found out she wasn't the only one. He had other girlfriends.<br><br>She then left him, Sara said, but a month later, she found out she was pregnant. She hoped he would 'help me through this, say he wanted (the baby) or at least talk to me'.<br><br>She claimed: 'Instead, I had to pester him every day for money to pay for the abortion.' She still carries a copy of her baby's foetal scan with her.<br><br>ABORTION<br><br>The abortion cost $650. Patrick eventually paid $200. Sara's mother knew about her pregnancy and borrowed the rest.<br><br>She claimed she is not bitter and denies she's trying to get back at them.<br><br>Like Sara, Amy (not her real name) also spent time with foreign players.<br><br>And one of them tried to woo Amy, 27, a teacher. He too bombarded her with promises and declarations of love.<br><br>Ryan (not his real name) called her his 'lover', saying he wanted to 'do something physical' with her.<br><br>'I was freaked out and exhausted from fending him off,' said Amy. 'I told him I was not that sort of girl.'<br><br>But she slowly developed a fondness for him. 'We could talk for hours on the phone,' she said.<br><br>After two dates, he revealed he needed money, telling her that 'I'm growing thin because I have no provisions at home'.<br><br>At their third date - a dinner after football training - Amy followed Ryan to his home which he shared with other foreign football players.<br><br>She claimed Ryan tried to get physical with her. 'That was when I told myself that it was time to get out,' she said. And the relationship cooled.<br><br>Amy and Sara put The New Paper on Sunday in touch with two other girls who, they believed, had similar encounters with these footballers. But these girls declined to be interviewed.<br><br>Amy said she was lucky.<br><br>'I found out later that (some in the group) were SMSing several girls at the same time, telling them things like 'I cannot live without you',' she claimed. - Additional reporting by Tan Mae Lynn<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>WE DID NOTHING WRONG WITH SARA<br><br>WHEN contacted by The New Paper on Sunday, both Michael and Patrick admitted they knew Sara.<br><br>But they maintained that they had not done anything wrong.<br><br>When he first met her, Sara was the girlfriend of Ben, his then-housemate, claimed Michael.<br><br>He himself had a girlfriend then, added Michael, but he suspected that Sara was secretly in love with him. That would explain all the allegations against him, he said.<br><br>Ben has since left the country and is uncontactable.<br><br>Michael said Sara was a frequent visitor. 'Sometimes, I would come home and she would be in Ben's room, and the door would be locked,' he said. 'Sometimes, she stayed overnight too.'<br><br>Michael claims he never had sex with Sara.<br><br>Did he ever hold her hand?<br><br>'Yes, I did. But in my country, we hold hands with everybody.'<br><br>Has he ever kissed her?<br><br>'Of course, but only on the cheek. I kiss all my friends. I even kissed her mother,' he said.<br><br>Patrick, who Sara claims made her pregnant, said he never forced her to visit him or have sex with him.<br><br>'She was my girlfriend,' he said. 'She had the right to say yes or no.'<br><br>But after their break-up, Patrick didn't offer to pay for the abortion because he wasn't sure the baby was his. 'After me, she was hanging out with a lot of other people,' he said.<br><br>Patrick claimed there were a lot of stories about Sara, but she was 'not a bad person'.<br><br>'She has a good heart and is very curious about other people. That's why she became our friend when we came to Singapore,' he said.<br><br>'But that's why people take advantage of her, too.'<br><br>He says he still hears people boasting about how Sara had been their girlfriend and 'they did this, they did that'.<br><br>'I told her that she was young and should concentrate on her studies, not on finding a boyfriend.'<br><br>So why did he get into a relationship with her at all?<br><br>RELUCTANT<br><br>'I was reluctant, but she wanted it,' he said.<br><br>Both Michael and Patrick said they no longer saw Sara because 'she has found new friends'.<br><br>So are foreign footballers surrounded by eager young women?<br><br>'Why should people care?' asked Michael, who is dating a 23-year-old secretary.<br><br>'It is my life. I am a footballer and maybe a lot of people like me because of that.'<br><br>At least one local club has a curfew for foreign players and insist that they should not have women guests at the accommodation they are provided.<br><br>Other clubs only caution the players against any illegal activity.<br><br></div>
