            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm...... I would have continued searching, at least, I would have, if not for the fact that a girl who made sure that I'm <strong>HERS</strong> snared me, and made sure I can never ever run away from her fabulous cooking again stopped me dead in my tracks.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>But anyway... basically put, I'll keep looking (if I'm unattached) so long as I'm below the age of 30. Why ? That's coz the chances of finding a nice, honest girl literally go downhill, in proportion to a person's age.<br><br>By that time, if I can't find what I expect, or at least, mostly expect, then I'm afraid that I would have to settle down with what I have.<br><br>Is there an end to it ? Depends if you wake up in time to realise it, or if you're "blinded" enough to keep on looking. Some people managed to find that pot of gold at the other end of the rainbow, some don't.<br><br>Some give up, and compromise for something lower. Though deep down, they still yearn, wishing that they found what they wanted instead. Its human nature. A person strives to find what he/she has been looking for deep down. Only a lucky few find what they want. Many do not. They just don't realise it, until its too late, and they're stuck with something that they don't really want.<br><br>Looks and Character. A debate that has been going on for years, with no definite answer. Ultimately, it depends on the beholder, and the person who is the object of the beholder. If the beholder sees the object as perfect, with no marrs, or imperfection either characteristically, or physically, there will be none. If the beholder finds the object flawed, it will be so.<br><br>Much as we would like character to be the predominate factor in this modern world, it is, unfortunately, not the case. In the school environments, people would hang out with the lookers, in work, people with better looks has an edge, in real life, people with looks have a bigger social circle, and seem to have more.<br><br>Basically put. Looks are a more immediate gauge of a person, before character. Of course, Character has a place. Only that its 2nd, compared to looks, since it takes longer for people to "see" a person's character.<br><br>My 2 cents on the matter.<br><br>------------------<br>"A Gentleman is not an implement."<br>-Confucius, Analects, 2:12</div>

I'm pleasantly surprised to see the lengthy YET juicy replies  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> ... well ... a lot of times, we make our decisions based on past experiences ... if we had had GOOD experiences, we would 've probably wanted more of what we had received ... if we had had BAD experiences, probably we would be extremely cautious in the hope that we would not make the same mistakes again ... unfortunately not all things are always so clear cut ... the truth is often blurred by lies and distortions be it by our limited vision or by other people ... to a certain extend we had to rely on our innate instincts to pass judgements ... there was never a right or a wrong ... it's merely a matter of our personal preferences ... perhaps the greatest dilemma is to risk making the same "mistake" or not to risk ... the problem ... if we were not to risk we would never have known the results of our decision be favourable or otherwise ... however ... if we were to risk, we may end up in greater agony ... Once bitten twice shy, aint it?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Perhaps ... wats most important is how we handle the consequences be it good or bad ...

            <div class='col-md body'>I personally do not think there is such thing as a perfect, ideal mate. No human is perfect and will be a perfect, ideal partner for another human. There will definitely be a compromise somewhere. Our expectations of the perfect someone that will cater to our every need and want and be everything that we ever wanted in a man/woman will alway remaain just that... expectations. These expectations have probably changed before to make it more realistic. I know mine have. I used to want a perfect gal when I was 10 to 12 yrs old. But now I am more forgiving. She can have one flaw!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I have not compromised my dream gal since then. I am a hopeless romantic I think and even after saying all that I did above, I still think that I will hope till I die that there is someone out there for me. I will trust in God to bring her to me. Please please please...    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> If I do not find her I will not get married. Period.<br><br>Character is most important but looks do count to us, no matter what. We are still human and not perfect. We fall into temptation all the time and going for physical looks and appearances is one of the worst that we can succumb to. And we do fall for beautiful people, all the time. Doesn't that suck sometimes? Esp. for the kind, caring, not so beautiful people? They are such good people and yet no one likes them bcos they are ugly?! The world is unfair...    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>------------------<br>Let him that move the world, first move himself.<br><br>[This message has been edited by sleek (edited 10 March 2000).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by sleek (edited 10 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Xue ... you have made quite a TRUE point which probably most people would agree .... before we really fall in love, we are almost always in search of the ideals which may not be too practical in this realistic world ... some compromise have to be made inevitably ...if we are unwilling to even make a lil sacrifice by compromising a lil, it's really hard for anyone to even fall in love and much less to say that they feel love/loved ... It would be such a shame not to even know how it feels to be really in LOVE and the whole life would have been "wasted" just like that ... =(<br><br>However, it'll be good if we can differentiate between true love and infactuation and those jerks who are merely toying with other people's feelings ... Well, to be fair, this applies to both sexes ... though it's really sad to say that most of these are actually guys ... the are some ladies who does the same too ... is it out of revenge? or otherwise ... heaven knows ...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
