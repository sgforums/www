China and vietnam is too far for us to help in anyway, but we must bust them <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> Pls keep me informed..No pics pls,  i can't take it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

No Did I enjoy my dinner ?Yes but I made it a point  to ask people what meat they are serving from then on so as to make sure I never eat dog again.Man is standing at the top of the food chain we ate anything and everything for survival but now that food is abundant there is no need kill our best friend when we are hungry.I dont believe anyone is desperate enough to sell dog meat in Singapore or desperate enough to dine on a chihuahua but if the report is true,let these people be exposed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yep. i cant stand people whose only beef against eating dogs is "they are cute pets" and all that f---ing nonsense.<br><br>to me, i simply can not take this kind of sh-t because it IS nonsense.<br><br>however, one shouldnt eat dog meat in SG because it is unlikely to be certified as fit for consumption by the relevant authorities.</div>
