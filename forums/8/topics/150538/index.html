            <div class='col-md body'>This is the talking cock version :<br><br>DPM Tony Tan to Become President of Hair Product Company<br>Posted on Sunday, July 03, 2005<br>Topic: Politics<br><br>by Nyonya Kway<br><br>When Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan retires in August, he will not run for the Presidency of Singapore as is widely rumoured. Rather, he will become President of the Board of Tancho Hair Products (S) Pte Ltd.<br><br><img src="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/images/stories/tonytancho.gif"><br>Â“We have been courting DPM Tan for the longest time,Â” said Tancho spokesman Liam Tao Mor. Â“Aside from being a capable administrator, he truly represents our brand Â– why, he must put half a bottle of Tancho into his hair every morning!Â”<br><br>DPM Tan was a natural, Mr. Liam explained, also because of his name. Â“Tan, and Tancho,Â” he said. Â“They go together like hair and oil. A slick combination.Â”<br><br>It is believed that the longstanding rumours about DPM Tan running for President originated from TanchoÂ’s bid to woo him from office upon retirement.<br><br>Â“We will be launching a new line in his honour,Â” said Mr. Liam. Â“Tony by Tancho: For Men of Distinction.Â”<br><br>DPM TanÂ’s move has stirred controversy in the hair care world.<br><br>Apparently, rival hair cream producer Code 10 had also been making overtures to DPM Tan to join their ranks. Said Code 10 spokesman Bill Kreem, Â“We too wanted to start a line in honour of DPM Tan: Code Tan by Code 10. But the deal sadly fell through and weÂ’re now tearing our hair out.Â”<br><br>According to a source in DPM TanÂ’s office, one of the first things he will do when he enters Tancho, is to go over their business practices with a fine toothed comb.<br><br>Â© http://www.TalkingCock.com 2001-2003.
