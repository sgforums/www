            <div class='col-md body'>Again, another topic which set my mind a blazing.<br>As we are all aware of, flaming is becoming a daily, even hourly occurrence in this forum. I am as guilty as the next party in perpetuating this habit, Lord knows how much I can't resist "shooting" at lamers and idiots. However, some forumites (quazimodo and Angeldark comes to mind) have urged for calm and sanity to take hold. Aspiring Nobels winner they might be but alas, as realism (my life dictating philosophy) shows us, their are words are taken in vain and perhaps sniggered at. Who can remember the peace maker when the warlords and the merchants of death are the ones to hogged the limelight. Nobody can remember Gamal Abdel-Nasser when we have Saddam Hussein.<br><br>The Net is supposed to be the ultimate playground for the anarchist of the world, where freedom of speech and action literally meant just that. It was a brilliant place to be and new age liberals were quivering with delight at such concept. That is, until naked kids and 1001 ways to make bombs appeared alongside disney.com. Ahhh, that is when we see the influx of more and more undesirable  elements in the net. Of course, depending on who your are, the pedophiles and guerillas will swore that you are encroaching on their god-damm given rights to privacy and uncensored information on the cyber highway. Other more self righteous people, or cynical government waiting for excuses to stamp their foot and red tape all over the place, will ask for more control and regulation.<br>I believed certain balances might be made and growing up in a patriarchal and liberty-shackled society, i tends to view with favour regulations and rules. In a perfect world will we see the rise of full liberty and the abandoning of control ala Plato's Utopia (am i correct here?? my pol.sci. is slipping away from me) If we can be expected to behave with the proper virtues, why should we need watchmen for??? The Net was the first experiment at judging the mental capability of the humans and whether the age old question of man are inherently good/evil can be resolved. It can't and controls are needed to curb the baser instincts of mankkind.<br><br>This brings me back to the question of the emergence of lamers and idiots in this forum. We have seen first hand their behaviour and conduct. Messer Youwen is fond of Caps Lock and he tends to shove down his views on people's throat. Well, nothing wrong with that, with all the 2 cents views thrown into this forum i would have been a millionaires few times over, freedom of speech rules. Hugo was another example of the former case. However, we began to see him denigrate into a irritant , with his now infamous and immortal words, GO AND DIE. Again, nothing wrong with that. After all, even those MPs have to put up with the antics of good old Jeya(he with the funny hair and beard) in parliament. Ditto for I M TWAT, i guess the name is self explanatory and can we ever bear to be cruel to the intellectually inferior??? However,  ILOVELEX and phoenix9 smells of mischief. Their purpose in here is to create confusion and strike at their enemies with a cloak of invisibility. So how do we guard against such people...or for that matter, should we even be acting in the first place???<br><br>Let me show you something guys, thanks to Daba for showing it to me.(daba is one of the moderators in a games forum i frequently. And for your information, he hails from Philipines, where democracy and freedom of speech are sacred values)<br><br>Rules you MUST follow:<br>1) No flames, direct or indirect.<br>2) No cloning. EX: A flames B. B retaliates. A gets scared, signs out and re-signs in as C. Now, as C, he "talks" with A and tells him to stop flaming, and talks to B as well to stop retaliating. People like that are SICK, and I don't want SICK people in my board.<br>3) I HATE HACKERS. The moment you attempt one I'll find out and you'll be sorry.<br>4) If you wanna make foreign conversations, tell the board that you will so it won't be impolite.<br>5) NO INVALID AND FRAUDULENT INFO IN YOUR PROFILES. You must post your e-mail address in every post you make (it's simple, a cookie will write it down for you so you won't have a hard time just make sure it's VALID). I'll be checking the e-mail addresses you guys have now and then (obviously by sending you e-mail msgs) and if they're FAKE or INVALID you'll be banned for being a fraud. If any of these rules are violated for ANY REASON, you'll be BANNED.<br><br>If you are a flamer and/or a hacker, I have a new section in my site, the "Hall of Flame", where I'll be posting your name and e-mail or IP address for everyone to see, and say that you're a flamer. The Internet Police (www.cybercrime.gov) will be contacted and they will be given your info and they'll contact your Internet Provider and other Internet Providers and have your account deactivated, PERMANENTLY. IF the case of hacking and flaming is severe, the law will take care of you from there. There's no gravity or level of offense here. Do it and you'll have it. It's easy to trace you, and I don't want to do work like that. Please stay out of trouble at least for your own sake. Oh yeah one more thing, I'm not saying this to SCARE YOU OFF or anything ok? I just want to have the most disciplined SRW English Board on the net. And since I have a reputation to maintain as moderator, I get all the faults if the board gets a bad name. I don't want that to happen. Having read the rules, do oyu comply or not?<br>Please reply ASAP so I can process your application (whether to accept it or reject it).<br>Sincerely Yours, Daba Myrod<br><br>Not a bad concept right??? You tell me.<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>
