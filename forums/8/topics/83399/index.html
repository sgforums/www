            <div class='col-md body'>I have had very bad experience with this certain Â‘brandedÂ’ furniture named Â‘CeXXXniÂ’..<br><br>Two months ago, I planned for the renovations, furniture etc.. for my new flat. Renovation is done on the 1st June. Electrical items are delivered on the 4th June and last will be my sofa, bed-frame, mattress and dining table on the 11th June. Once it is completed, I can hold my house warming and my birthday party.<br><br>11th June 2004 @ 4.30pm<br>Dining tables, 6 chairs, Queen Size bedframe and head-board, bedside table and sofaÂ… that will cost me more than S$3000.<br><br>I received glass dining table top- cannot be joined with its legs because no rubber suction for the glass top. Bedframe came the King Size and the head board came the queen size. The sofa came the wrong module (shape of the sofa is wrong). They delivery man told me to sign on the invoices to inform what is wrong etc.. I indicated on the invoice but did not signed when it is not the items I have ordered. The delivery man even told me that they will be back on Saturday to install the bedframe and the dining table.<br>I called up the Marina Square branch where I ordered these items and was told that Â‘SelinaÂ’ is on leave and will be back on Saturday (12th June). They will leave a message for her to return a call.. Hence, I waited the whole day on Saturday for them to come and a call from the sales girl.. 6pm on Saturday.. nobody turns up and worst of all nobody call me. I called up to the branch in Park Mall where they told me Â‘SelinaÂ’ is now stationed there. I called up more than 3 times and was told she is serving customer, serving customer and serving customers. I am very very fustrated now. Am I not their customer? She should have called me immediately when she is at the branch to settle these issue with me before she do anything else. Why is it so that I have to be placed in last when the things happened on Friday.<br><br>On Monday (14th June @ 3pm), I still have not receive her call. I called up personally again in the noon and she is in the ladies. I told the other girl as I am now really very angry. Selina returned a call and asked me Â‘my story againÂ’. How could she not known anything about what had happened. Her answer is " I will feedback to the customer service (located in Loyang) and let you know later.. She told me customer service Â‘PiterÂ’ will call me tomorrow (15th June) to arrange the replacement etcÂ… I gave them a date to replace the items on 19th June 2004.<br><br>Once bitten twice shy.. I have guessed things wonÂ’t be smoothly for this time round.<br>On the 19th June 2004 @ 6pm, the delivery man came and bring up the bed-frame.. I stood infront of them seeing how and what they are doing. Just as I expected, something went wrong again.. I couldnÂ’t place my mattress onto a bedframe whereby there is no board for the mattress.. They told me it wasnÂ’t indicated on their Delivery Note. I told them go back and inform the customer service again. It means there will be delay again. I called up and inform Â‘SelinaÂ’ again and told her to inform the customer service and I will have to seek CASE help if no solution is given to explain the delays etc.. I am worst than angry. ItÂ’s like the fire burning all over my place and body. She says Â‘ok lor, if you have to report to case, there is nothing I can doÂ’.  I thought this time round someone will have the initiative to call me back on the following Monday (21st June). @ 4pm, I called up personally to Piter. He knows about this thing went wrong again.. Yet, he canÂ’t be bothered to call me. The very first thing he mentioned thru the phone is Â‘ I was told that only the board for the mattress was not deliveredÂ’. Hey, read carefully, Â‘What is only the board for the mattress was not deliveredÂ’? This is a very important sentence. It means that " Oh, the dining table is ok, the sofa is changed and the bedframe is set-upÂ’, haiya only the board is missed out mahÂ’!! Does it sounds like this?<br><br>I told him off immediately. How do you expect me to sleep when I have the bed-frame but the mattress must be placed on the floor to sleep..and what do you mean by Â’onlyÂ’? Since you know about this case, why didnÂ’t you bother to call me early in the morning? The sofa replacement was not delivered to me at all! He have the cheek to tell me that the delivery man bring along the sofa but they have forgotten to bring it up for me.. How many times do you want to deliver only three simple items which cost more than S$3000 dollars? I demanded a 50% off the balance and guess what.. He says no.. however, out of goodwill he can offer me a S$150 Â‘CeXXXniÂ’ voucher. Oh my goodness, I say I am not going to buy anymore things from Â‘CeXXXniÂ’. It is a very bad experience. What is that S$150 compare to my S$3000 spent for these troubles, these attitudes, these services from you! He even have the cheek to tell me that Â‘It is not that we did not service youÂ’. What a nice sentence I ever hear from someone who is in the wrong and doesnÂ’t want to admit wrong! If your service provided is wrong again and again, do you mean this as service? It is just like no service and worst of all, it is only Â‘troublesÂ’.<br><br>I do not know why this issue is not brought up to their management. I wanted to speak to someone higher position than Piter but he insisted that he is a manager. I wanted an explanation from Â‘CeXXXniÂ’. Do you think my S$3000 is worth only S$150 voucher plus 3 deliveries for 3 items? Do you think a simple word Â‘sorryÂ’ can resolve the trouble you have given? Do you mean by talking to me loudly/shouting means you are greater than me? Do you mean I have to accept your apology when things went wrong again and again. I really hate this kind of service from them.<br><br></div>
