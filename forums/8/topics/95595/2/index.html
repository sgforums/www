In fact, he is blaming the media in Taiwan for reporting this and letting Singapore know about this comment which he made in a "private meeting" with Tai Nan people.<br><br>But, I never like attributing the action of one person to a whole country. Especially in this case the media in Taiwan do not support him at all. So, hate him if you want, I do not like him too. But I leave the Taiwanese people aside.<br></div>
