Although armed with vast experiences, the older worker is expected to do manual work which the younger one shun....  The WDA officer told me we must not expect to be employed like before and asked us not to be choosy but to take any job that come along.  Their responsibilities at that moment was to look for a job for you and not a career....  I am 45 with not much education and worked my way to manager post at the last job.  So no choice but to do manual work lor....  sigh .....  The Government sector is not taking the lead in employing older worker, so how to expect pte company to do so ???  We don't asked for hight pay but at least a desk bound as that was  my previous work was, but then .............<br></div>

And you know la, face is everything, more important than continuing to feel useful and contributing to society, right? also i rather check the moods of my children before asking them for favors than to lose face in front of my friends, but hor on second thoughts, all these people i know also ganna the same situation like me, but nevermind la, face is most important.<br><br>And, these skills being taught here really no prestige one, also cannot get you the supervisory job that you truly deserves la, but dont know why so many people on waiting list leh, singapore is a place where people all rush to queue when government tries to offer free things, where got face like this hor? If I am you hor, I start writing application letters for office aircon jobs la, even though i know that the longer the application period, i will become more anxious and demoralized, so bad for my blood pressure and my heart. nevermind la, in spore no face is almost death la.<br><br>So back to business la, talk so much for what, so i cancel your that cutter job okay? also, you must tell me now whether you want this training or not la, my boss pressuring me to close cases, ok?"</span></div>
