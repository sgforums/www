            <div class='col-md body'>Most educational agents in Singapore will be able to handle enquiries on Australian Universities. They will be able to provide free service and arrangement (e.g. application, hostel arrangement, airport reception, and etc). Please note that this services are supposedly to be free. If the agent you have approached charge you for such service, just look for a new one.<br><br>Australian University will also send their International department representative to Singapore for presentation or open house twice or more per year. Depend on the university and agent, you will be able to get your application fees waive if you submit them to the representative on the same day. (Save your money too.) Application will range from A$50 - A$100, depending on the university.<br><br>IDP will also be able to arrange such procedure but they tend to leave the applicant to make their own decision in hostel and generally not too customer-friendly.<br><br>Eight university in Australian formed the Group of Eight University. These universities are able to obtain more research fund from the government and generally you will not go wrong by joining them.<br><br>Do however note that some university are good in some areas of studies but do not make it into the group of eight as the G8 focus on research.<br><br>Good Luck <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A little info I should post here after I received a couple of PMs regarding the options for Singapore students who have completed O Levels and wish to study in Queensland, Australia.<br><br>Unfortunately, there is no JC in Australia. There are two routes you can take, very much like Singapore:<br><br>1) Australian High School<br><br>The transition from their equivalent of "O level standard" is seamless. After year 10 (their equivalent of sec 4), students wishing to go to uni or other tertiary study can study for 2 more years. Complete year 11 and year 12, at the end of which you will sit for an exam and then obtain an OP score. This OP score then determines which uni and which course you can go. The lower, the better. Entrance to competitive courses generally needs very low OP (e.g. medicine must have OP 1, law OP 2)<br><br>High school for international students costs roughly AU$8,000 a year. The more reputable ones in Brisbane where I live are Brisbane Grammar, Brisbane Girls. Generally hard to get in. Quite a few state schools take in international students, like Indooroopilly State High School. Please refer to the Queensland Government website for this. The URL is http://www.qld.gov.au/services_for_queenslanders/education_and_learning/international_students.html<br><br>2) TAFE (Technical and Further Education)<br><br>The second route is to go for a TAFE diploma course, like polytechnic. After a TAFE diploma is obtained (duration differs among courses, but usually 2 - 3 years), students with good results can apply for direct entry into 2nd year of uni in a relevant course. This is good if you already know what you want to do and want to start working as soon as possible. Again, more info at http://www.qld.gov.au/services_for_queenslanders/education_and_learning/international_students.html . As the TAFE programs are controlled by the State government, there isn't any TAFE college that is "better" per se than another. However this is subject to personal opinion.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Weirdo80:</div><div class="quote_body">A little info I should post here after I received a couple of PMs regarding the options for Singapore students who have completed O Levels and wish to study in Queensland, Australia.<br><br>Unfortunately, there is no JC in Australia. There are two routes you can take, very much like Singapore:<br><br>1) Australian High School<br><br>The transition from their equivalent of "O level standard" is seamless. After year 10 (their equivalent of sec 4), students wishing to go to uni or other tertiary study can study for 2 more years. Complete year 11 and year 12, at the end of which you will sit for an exam and then obtain an OP score. This OP score then determines which uni and which course you can go. The lower, the better. Entrance to competitive courses generally needs very low OP (e.g. medicine must have OP 1, law OP 2)<br><br>High school for international students costs roughly AU$8,000 a year. The more reputable ones in Brisbane where I live are Brisbane Grammar, Brisbane Girls. Generally hard to get in. Quite a few state schools take in international students, like Indooroopilly State High School. Please refer to the Queensland Government website for this. The URL is http://www.qld.gov.au/services_for_queenslanders/education_and_learning/international_students.html<br><br>2) TAFE (Technical and Further Education)<br><br>The second route is to go for a TAFE diploma course, like polytechnic. After a TAFE diploma is obtained (duration differs among courses, but usually 2 - 3 years), students with good results can apply for direct entry into 2nd year of uni in a relevant course. This is good if you already know what you want to do and want to start working as soon as possible. Again, more info at http://www.qld.gov.au/services_for_queenslanders/education_and_learning/international_students.html . As the TAFE programs are controlled by the State government, there isn't any TAFE college that is "better" per se than another. However this is subject to personal opinion.<br></div></blockquote>there is also Private colleges affliated with universities such as Trinity college which is affliated with university of melbourne. But you have to come over here to check them out. There are a few trinity colleges around affliated with different universities</div>
