            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly,i mean Rejection as in she doesnt wanna be ur steady .ok,Why cant (most ok,i didnt say all)S'porean guys cant tk rejection &amp; some act like its the end of the world!! I've rejected many guys (who'd asked me go steady) coz i dun feel anything towards them &amp; just wanna remain as frenz.But the guy's ego affects him so much,tt some dun even wanna remain frens wif me.They just disappear from my life,all b'coz i rejected them.Our frenship ended just like tt!!! WHY??? We all know u cant force one 2 love,so wen we S'porean gals reject u guys,some of u accuse us of not liking u b'coz u aint gd-lookin enuff/aint rich enuff/no car ...blahblah,the lists goes on.I admit (some of us) r materialistic girls but sometimes those aint the reason Y we reject u guys!!<br>Another incident (tis guy tot i didnt accept him b'coz he didnt have centre-parting hairstyle),so after rejection,he (like many others) disappeared frm my life)...only wen he finally found a girlfren &amp; grew his hair.He told my fren tt he wanted 2 show off his hair &amp; gf 2 me.That is SOooo Ridiculous!!! Trying 2 spite me 4 wat?i dun even give a darn!!..Haiz...the guy's ego....Ne way,rejection is part of ur lives,if u guys cant tk it den i suggest u guys go ahead &amp; migrate 2 Taiwan where the gals r "chio &amp; friendly"...chasing S'pore gals is not a task for the weaklings esp. those who cant tk rejection!!!<br><br>------------------<br><strong> Age : </strong> 17 <strong> Sex : </strong> Female <strong> Attitude : </strong> FxxKed Up<br><strong> Every1 has an attitude...Every1 needs an attitude...But not every1 gets an attitude they need... </strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm..maybe when they asked u, they felt as if they had crossed a line..no turning back.  If guys who wooed u had been rejected, they shd be feeling malu i guess.. anyway things shd get better as everybody grows up..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>They say that Nan Nan Nu Nu Shou Shou Bu Qing, another way of saying it would be that if a man and a woman is not a couple, they cannot be friends. How true is this? I think to a certain extent this is true.<br><br>Why?<br><br>(1)At the teenage years, people are still going through a phase of change, lives are not settled, they want excitment, something they can feed on. Everchanging lifestyles are the norm. So SOME guys would rather spend their time with a gf than 'wasting' time on someone whom they see will play no part in developing their lives.<br><br>(2)When people grow older, lives become more stable. People have a set routine, like going to work, etc etc. They don't spend the same type of commitment like in the teenage days, ie, not spend so much time with friends. So they see no problem making friends with opposite sex.<br><br>Well, maybe some guys cannot take rejection because they are<br>(1) too egoistic?<br>(2) too in love?<br>(3) just trying too hard?<br><br>Then there is also the case of some guys hanging around after being rejected<br>(1) trying to wait for you?<br>(2) try again some time later?<br><br>Actually,some girls also can't take rejection ah!! dUNNO whether the same reason as with guys or not. Is is not that i don't want to be friends with them but it is just that they harp the hope that one day we might be together again. This issue never seems to die away.. Best way is to ignore the person or to see less of her..<br><br>Usually, i repeat.. USUALLY, most guys even, after rejection, they might not take it.. but it is only temporary.. like a passing thingy, they will snap out of it.. put it out of their heads and happily go about with their next target as if nothing has happened...<br><br>------------------<br><strong>I cOnSiDeR MySeLf aN ExPeRt tOmAtO gArDeNeR sInCe aLL oF mY FrIeNdS TeLL mE I hAvE tHe mOsT CoLoUrFuL aNd sWeEtEsT tOmAtOeS.</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Life is too short to bother with tasteless tomatoes."<br></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sigh, Typically, those (most) spore guys that you, the young sg girl had encounterred are still teenagers who are not mature enuff to know what's life in this practical world. Some even stupid enuff to throw their life away for just being a failure in BGR. These guys have not gone thru any real stuff in the real world, being shielded by their parents who provide everything for them. They typically have no worry at all but just to enjoy having fun around, playing lan game, wooing pretty girl to show-off and squandering their parent's hard-earned money. Have they thought about their own future in singapore. Seldom or even never. They only know that their world will end if they cannot get this so-called pretty girl as their gf. Have they ever thought of how they are going to start or support a family when his parent are no longer around to help him. No! they thought they will have everything provided by their rich parents. In other words, they are highly dependent and pampered by their parent. These are the immature guy that you met.<br><br>Yup, you are right in scolding them if you are scolding them in the right sense. Why should they be bothered by a rejection by a sg girl who might be snobbish enuff not to let him has a chance?? i wonder why? It's not the end of the world at all. There are so many other more important and meaningful stuff to be done than just getting a snobbish pretty sg girl as his gf. There is a whole big forest whether in or out of sg, why be bothered by a rejection by a local tree? Firstly, i would think is that he should concentrate in building himself up, be independent and successful in his career. Be a man in this sense while maintaining his bgr without jeapardizing his future. If the girl leave him, there always other girls in the queue if he is successful in the future. Why worry? It's not the end of the world i like to stress and there no need to avoid the girl who rejected him at all. "Just can't be bother" should be the atitude like what Inzaghi had said. It's more like the guy being mature and hence turn his effort and time on other things or gers. I fully agree with inzaghi's view.<br><br>The argument about can't take rejection and some act like its the end of the world i believe applies to those immature sg guy who have nothing better to do. Wake up, guys!!! Stop fooling around, and gambatte.</div>
