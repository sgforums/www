It's real practical world outside, which guy want to waste his effort going after something that he think is impossible. The girl want to keep him as a frn after rejection, no one say cannot even himself will not reject. I believe he will still wave to her as a frn when they met on the street. It just that he will not spent much effort and time on her. That's all. Why keep a relationship going on with a ger that will end up to nothing. Keep it as just a plain seeyou-hello-goodbye frn will do.<br><br>Furthermore, the guy would consider the case when others (whether guys or girls) see this ger with him. Others will think that she is his gf and they are par toring when in deep inside his heart, he know the true answer which is impossible. You should know how much it will hurt? Guy are practical enuff to keep thing clear so that everything is obvious and other chances will not be missed, option open. Be it a chance for new guy to try to woo the ger or a chance for the guy to woo new girl.<br><br>It's not a matter of can or cannot take rejection anymore. Be mature, do you think bgr is a game?? only playboy will be able to do otherwise. Guy with a sincere heart to know a girl will not behave like what you had said, still going out with the girl, chating with her etc after a rejection. Love hurt and it take time to heal. The guy merely need some time to recover and carry on with his life, keeping his option open, that's all.<br><br>Can take or cannot take rejection? It is a game??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Like i had said, I do still keep in touch with my Ex-gf occasionally esp on her birthday after she broke off with me. Once i even treat her to a birthday dinner when she has no date with anyone to celebrate her birthday. Other than these, i seldom call or meet her just to keep thing clear and not to cause any misunderstanding. She got her own life with her bf and i got mine. We are each spenting our time and effort on our own partner. Why should guy after rejection keep such a close and unclear relationship with his ex? For what? To cause misunderstanding and make the current partner unhappy?</div>
