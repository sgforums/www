            <div class='col-md body'>Unfair competition is always the key higher profitability. Lets say both you and Muthu plant oranges. But Muthu has a bunch of people who will work for $0.50 an hour while your workers will only work for $1 an hour. Obviously Muthu's cost is lower and thus will be able to sell his oranges cheaper! Again, I stress that whether his oranges are sweeter or not is another story altogether. Now apply this to the Evergreen and Mersek issue.<br><br>Are you familiar with Microsoft's .NET technology? .NET is Microsoft's bid against Sun's Java. The story is that Microsoft was late. When Java was a already well developed, .NET was just starting out. But Microsoft went ahead to announce and praise .NET to the sky. Now many users started to hold off on Java and decided to wait and see whether .NET could be better. That's expectation management.<br><br>Now apply this to Malaysia's tactics again to spot the similarities. Cheap? I don't think so. Microsoft's the largest software developer in the world. Fair?
