              <p>it's not abt the gender or abt whether women can do it.....it's abt spending that $1 million <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/sad.png" alt="sad.png">...especially when everybody is struggling ......</p>
              <p>Singaporean definitely got no qualm dishing out million bucks to help the unfortunates as proven in our donations last years but definitely not to satisfy some egos and proving that one gender can do better than the others.

              <p><strong>Singapore's first women's Everest team raises funds for climb<br></strong><span class="update">By Valarie Tan, Channel NewsAsia | </span><span class="update">Posted: 12 July 2008 2354 hrs </span></p>

              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Singapore's first all women's Everest team has so far raised only 20 per cent of their S$1 million budget to scale the world's highest peak. <br><br>The six-women team was to have climbed Mount Everest in March this year, but a shortage of funds delayed their trip. <br><br>As part of their fundraising efforts, the team is now conducting team-building workshops for women and youths. Their latest workshop was for the cabin crew of SilkAir, which is sponsoring the Everest team's plane tickets. <br><br>The group is now planning to attempt the climb in March next year, but fundraising continues to be an uphill task. <br><br>Jane Lee, team leader of the Singapore Women's Everest Team, said: "Few people believe that a group of women can stick together for so long to climb a mountain, and I think fewer people believe that a group of women are capable of climbing a mountain together. <br><br>"But I feel that our string of successful expeditions have proven that as a team, we are performing and we are capable. And as the first women Everest team, we will make it next year when we go up Mount Everest." <br><br>More information on the team's efforts is available at this </span><a class="path" href="http://www.womenoneverest.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">website</span></span></a><span>. - CNA /ls</span></p>

              <p><br>I agree with TS. It's not about whether or not people believe they can do it or not. I personally believe women can also climb mountains, if not Mount Everest. But the issue here is whether such cause is worthy of our support and donation or not.</p>

              <p>Honestly speaking, this quote is a bit of a turn-off for me.</p>
              <p>I have no objections to people who want to pursue excellence in sport . If this team had wanted to climb the mountain purely 'Because it's there' (in the words of the legendary climber George Mallory), I would probably support them. Gender is not an issue here. I don't doubt that women can do it, and indeed, women have conquered Everest before.</p>
              <p>But right now, with this quote from the team leader, to me it looks more like some sort of stunt for the sake of showing that women can climb Mount Everest together.</p>
              <p>I would donate to sporting excellence, but I wouldn't donate to stunt attempts.</p>

              <p>So in summary, they can do whatever they can to raise their own funds. But gabermen will most likely not find any good reason to fund their expedition because they already had a team to represent Singapore in scaling Mt. Everest.</p>
              <p>Besides, what made them think that "<em>Few people believe that a group of women can stick together for so long to climb a mountain</em>"...? I wonder if they did any form of survey to prove their point.. Not that I wanna say, but.. sounds like publicity stint to turn attention to them.. I don't think it's really about them trying to prove a point.. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/omg.png" alt="omg.png"></p>

              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Singapore's first all women's Everest team has
              so far raised only 20 per cent of their S$1 million budget to scale
              the world's highest peak.<br> <br> The six-women team was to have climbed Mount Everest in March this
              year, but a shortage of funds delayed their trip.<br> <br> As part of their fundraising efforts, the team is now conducting
              team-building workshops for women and youths. Their latest workshop
              was for the cabin crew of SilkAir, which is sponsoring the Everest
              team's plane tickets.<br> <br> The group is now planning to attempt the climb in March next year,
              but fundraising continues to be an uphill task.<br> <br> Jane Lee, team leader of the Singapore Women's Everest Team, said:
              "Few people believe that a group of women can stick together for so
              long to climb a mountain, and I think fewer people believe that a
              group of women are capable of climbing a mountain together.<br> <br> "But I feel that our string of successful expeditions have proven
              that as a team, we are performing and we are capable. And as the
              first women Everest team, we will make it next year when we go up
              Mount Everest."<br> <br> More information on the team's efforts is available at this</span> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.womenoneverest.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">website</span></span></a><span>. - CNA

              <p><br>I would like them to give the public the transplarent breakdown of their budget. How is it possible to cost that much to climb Mount Everest even with sponsors?!!!</p>
              <p>Unless they need to pay tolls to those Yeti guards guarding the individual Mountain section, if no money to pay they will get raped by those Yeti guards is it?</p>
              <p>Anyway, any exceptional feats performed under exceptional comfort is no unexceptional feat at all.</p>
