            <div class='col-md body'>Recently a distant relative (uncle) of mine had told this love story which happened in the 80s between a boy and a girl, they were in their 20s then...For one the girl was very good looking and this guy as obsessed about her..He went all the way out to court her at the time .For some reason the girl rejected the guy's proposals and hurt his feeling terribly that he became a drunkard and got admitted in a mental hospital..after many years he  recovered ,started a new life  and reached the hreshold of his career and became a highly successful professional..The last time he heard of the girl was that she married someone else..or so it seems , her marriage ended up in divorce..hubby went after other women fooled around and left her bankrupt<br><br>Then the guy saw her again after so many years (now both of the in their 40s) and asked her how she was...She poured out her feelings to him and regretted what she did to him..She would have been better off married to this guy than that scumbag<br><br>Over the years, she had become an old middle aged woman and no longer young....It seems the guy never accepted her the second time round..His ideals about life had changed...he had suffered and now he expects good things in life...including young women....he had wasted so many years of his youth pinning for her, brought misery to his family and why should he accept her now?..The ordeal had changed his entire outlook in life all because of her..he had an obsessive crush back then and would probably have continued loving her sincerely  if the girl had accepted him.....now things have changed, he doesnt wants to remember anything to do with his past.....She would have in the least not rejected him in the first place as he was so devoted to her at the time, it might have been  still possible that they would have reconciled their differences after she had found out about her hubby's true colours...The morale of the story is especially to women, guys are and always been obsessive creatures never ever reject a guy if he likes u..keep him closer as soul mate and friend...For all u know u might never get such a chance again....<br><br>It never hurts to keep the person who adores u but it hurts to reject the same person who adores u so much..this may apply to guys too..This is ultimately the first step in making this world a better place to live in, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself ...nd that worldlings should know what this will lead us to do; that  of love, of kindness, and of law, should be uplifted in the world, and kept constantly before the people's eyes.</div>

But the girl rejected him because he was too poor for her and married a merchant/entreprener/banker. the guy was heartbroken and he become a drunkard/wanted to commit suicide but eventually he found new strength/picked up courage/forgot about her/learnt to work harder so that he can get rich and he eventually became a successful business man/government official/CEO of large company and earned lots of money and then one day he received a phone call from/met on street/got told by his secretary a beggar/hagard looking woman/Shit broke poor ass Bitch was looking for him and claimed to know him. Then he recognized that the woman was the girl he used to be obssessed with and he found out that her husband ended up in jail/became bankrupt/divorced her/abused her and she is penniless and in poor health/has daughter to feed/has debts to pay for her husband and she wishes to borrow money/beg for forgiveness from the guy and wish he could help her.<br><br>there you go.</div>

Will you feel the hurt if u reject somebody?  I doubt so.<br><br>Not everybody can be frens again after a break up.  It takes time.  And it depends on how much hurt is done.  </span></div>
