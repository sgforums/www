My dad is a super strict disciplinarian, and always cane or scold my sis, and my sis is the one who want to oppose the status quo - refuse to do housework, refuse to study, insist she get some more allowance even if she is working, basically a nightmare from hell..<br><br>And who win? My dad gave up, which is a shocking thing, without my sis uttering a single word to him.<br><br>Your 'acomplishment' is nothing.<br><br>Btw, I aint proud of this matter too, but many people 'managed' their parents  in a more effective and efficient way than yours, that why you must pardon me if i dont congratulate you on your 'accomplishment'<br><br></div></blockquote>then its just too bad for ur sis, luckily im not like that. i speak reason.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><strong>i have already given u the reasons as to why i dont like what he did, its too bad that u ignore it and keep repeating the same thing</strong></blockquote>your reasons are not even reasons. your reasons actually support the views of your father.<br><br><blockquote><strong>that made me someone who rights an injustice.</strong> </blockquote>There is no injustice in getting a kid to study when he should be studying.<br><br><blockquote><strong>being reasonable and righting injustices makes me immature? what kind of logic is that</strong></blockquote>The actions you took are NOT reasonable and doesn't right any wrongdoings at all. You immaturity shows at your constant gloating of victory over something all of us view as uncessary and not even a victory in the first place.<br><br>you father told your brother to study for an exam. Where is the wrong in that.<br><br>you support your brother to not study. That is something very wrong.<br><br>you say he's not going to study even if he stayed at home. What does it matter to you??<br><br>You said your father is an extra for saying that. He made a correct remark, you came in, you are now an extra.<br><br>Is that clear enough for you???</div>
