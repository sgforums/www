Hell knows how often this happens at home for me but i don't like, come here and shout out everytime it happens, ya dig? Plus, its not quite bright to wash your dirty laundry in public too... so u know, if he came here to post this, and if he has the guts to do it, then he must be prepared to be flamed for it too. I know. Sometimes when I post a topic, i know and I'm ready to be flamed. And handling being flamed is all part of having that "guts" u're talking about, u know. And u'd hardly expect ppl to go "yeah mate" "well done" would u? so I don't know what you are moaning about really. but well cheers.<br><br>btw. i like that line "muggers are myopic fools" gawd thats just soooo spot on! too bad them muggers NEVER see that. my JC was full of Shit like that. argh.</div>
