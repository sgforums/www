            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><strong>His intention isnt to let my brother study. He didnt even tell him to go and study. He just said "tmr is ur exam, dont go out." he knows my brother well enough to know that he will not study. if he truly wanted my brother to study then he would have said something back when i asked my brother those questions. knowing him, he would have just gone off to watch TV while letting my brother rot his time away at home. clearly his attempt at controlling people had been torn down by me, and he had to back off. </strong></blockquote>Once again, what your father does after telling ur brother to stay at home. does it matter to you? Why does all this matter to you in the first place? You are clearly being an EXTRA. If you noticed most do not even bother replying to you, and the next few replies are my last. You don't even have to state you case anymore, because you have not grown up. That's all.<br><br><blockquote><strong>he doesnt study, so i let him go to that place instead of wasting his time (and being disappointed and hungry)!<br>he doesnt get his meal, so he goes to that place to get his meal as planned!<br>exams tmr, but last minute work doesnt work well on him!</strong></blockquote>And? What does that matter to you? You care about your brother? Get him a meal then. If not, why do u bother? Once again you have proven to be an EXTRA.<br><br><blockquote><strong>well I owned him already didnt I!<br><br>they planned for him already, so things go according to plan and not suddenly change to wasting time at home not doing anything. my dad is not part of the planning team BTW. That is why i say he is an extra.<br><br>When u make a difference for the better by poking in, u are not an extra.</strong><br></blockquote>Grow up. Nobody OWNS anyone. This phrase itself already has settled the argument by the others and me on your maturity level. Gloating over things like this is NOT mature. And you have failed to see what you've done, which still deem as unecessary. You are not part of the team, you are an extra. You came into their argument/conversation, YOU are an EXTRA. Was anything verbal comment directed at YOU? Why did u say anything when nobody was talking to you??? Simple as that, you're an EXTRA.<br><br><blockquote><strong>becos i wanna feed them till they die!!</strong></blockquote>With your mentality and attitude, you would be finding trouble feeding yourself in the outside world. Grow up.<br><br>Any replies after this won't be entertained by me. Have fun explaining your reasons to others who will never agree with your views. If you look at the big picture, its you, against the rest of the world. Grow up.</div>
