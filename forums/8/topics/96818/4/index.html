Is it not my freedom to be mad at him? its not like i am going against him like i rebutt every single thing they say, or i take drugs and join gangs whatever. I only retort back when i find something wrong with their actions.<br><br>BTW my brother is in NT, and we have not much hopes for him in studying. No point forcing him if studying is not his strong point. maybe later he will bloom, but forcing him now will only be counter-productive.</div>

If he takes things out on us, do u expect me to have no reaction? He is actually quite approachable, but he is more to a clown and takes pleasure in seeing other people (or animals) get agitated.</div>

Muggers are myopic fools, and I'm glad someone else is able to see that point.<br><br>So please, stop riding the moral high ground with this kid.  He's happy he stood up to his dad, you don't think much of it - just say you're unimpressed instead of imposing your Confusionistic views on him...<br></div>
