            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore is made up of immigrants. Immigrants who were driven by economic factors and a chance to participate in capitalism. As such they brought with them their mercantilist instincts which included cunning, keen sense of competition, one-up manship, implicit fear of failure and the entire baggage of Chinese anal-retinalism to participate in a colony were the rules and regulations were pre-determined to benefit Britain. As such with these rules and regulations already in place, immigrants exercised their labour in a pre-conditioned situation. As post-immigrants, contemporary Singaporeans have not shaken off this mentality. How can they? Its only been less than 40 years since post-colonial independence. The mercantile instincts have not died (it continues to serve our economic needs) but the civilised society Singapore so hanker after will not materialise before Singaporeans rid themselves of its side-effects.<br><br>Until then Singapore will generally remain f**ked up.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Terrence,<br><br>In addition to your post, I will like to point out a few things why Singapore is the way it is.<br><br>When Singapore first gained its independence in 1965 during my parents' time, the problem is to built an economy so that our country can survive. The lack of natural resources made it difficult, and all we depend is on manpower. The older generation had the ideology that we need to work hard against adversity so that we can survive. Of course, the government has somehow managed to make Singapore an Asian miracle with the people here. Somehow, in the younger generation, we lacked the spirit of the older generation : the survival instinct.<br><br>One might argue that the situation is entirely different for our generation, and each generation have their own choice to live the way they want. I agree more or less, what my point of contention is that the economic success have somehow led to better quality lives, that most of the young have taken for granted. The kids have brainless toys like power rangers and etc, where I still remember in my time living in a kampong, where I made and played the spinning top.. The present generation have no idea how fortunate that they are living in. Only when they are thrown in the wild, they will realize that the world is not the way they see it...<br><br>The loss of ideology is one issue. The other thing is that there is a shifting of perspective. I would say that Singapore is no longer so much a British colony, but a hybrid of both British-American culture, particularly, it has evolved into a pro-American culture with the invasion of Borders, Starbucks, Coffee Bean... Things are changing so fast that people are lost, or people do not know how to think for themselves anymore, or lost the big picture of things. The young of today don't even know what they want, and be put into an examination oriented system. The Ministry of Education wants to change the education system, but they are implementing the change that it became a big wayang.<br><br>Singapore wants to be a cosmopolitan country, and induce foreign talent. I have no disagreements to that. What I feel funny, is that the emphasis in foreign talent, that the local talent is not even given a chance. I commented to a Japanese friend, that unlike Japan, where they protect their own talent but induce foreigners to their land, Singapore is doing the other extreme. This is not my view, but the view of some Singaporeans who  are here in UK. This explains why the country is losing so much talent.<br><br>The maturity of the country can only grow with people knowing what they want. This can only be done thru proper education. I recall that during the year when I attended the Pre-U seminar where the theme is entitled "The Next Lap", we bombed the speaker who talked about the gracious and caring society we seek to achieve. Someone probed the question given that we are so myopic and people are so sheltered in our perspective, how are we going to achieve that kind of ideal society? The speaker replied with "why not?", and a few gals rebutted him immediately with the following statement that still lingers in my mind,"Because that's the way it is..."<br><br>So much about my thoughts on this country which was once my home and may not be in the future.....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just some thoughts.....<br><br>Terence, you mentioned that Singapore is F***** up, you want to mention any concrete examples so we can discuss them?<br><br>Prodigal, while I agree with some of your points, like the younger generation not having the survival instinct cause we did not go through the war and such, some points I feel are open to debate.<br><br>First of all, you said that there was a loss in ideology. Did Singapore have an ideology to begin with? I think not. Singapore has always tried to adopt what some would call a pragmatic ideology, which is to adopt whatever ideology best serves our interest at the moment.<br><br>Then, you mentioned that the education system is a big wayang. Look at it from this way: Everything has a good and bad. There is no such thing as a good system or a bad system. Why MOE is changing the system is because they feel that the current system does not serve its purpose, so they have to change to one which better serves its purposes, which is to educate the younger generation in order to prepare them for the future.<br><br>With regards on foreign talent, I must say that agree that locals are perhaps not given enough chances. But then, in order to keep up our competitiveness, we have to have the best, and if locals like me cannot make the grade, then foreigners will have to be imported. Some locals are given chances, though only the best are. This is what I guess the effect of living in a meritocracy.<br><br>I don't really get what you mean with the Pre-U sem incident, care to clarify?<br><br>And you seem unsure whether you are going to stay in Singapore anymore, hmm....why?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Turtle :<br><br>On your first point, regarding the loss of ideology, I believed that there is an ideology to start with when LKY started his work on since 1965 (or even before that) to provide a strong infrastructure, a good living environment, and a wealthy nation. Thru good management, we managed to make it to be one of the most successful economic miracles in Asia. Thanks to the Asian crisis, we proved our worth. The younger generation do not have to start building things from scratch as compared to the older generation. Their job is to maintain the miracle which has been going on. As there is a chinese saying "create a empire is hard, but maintaining a empire is even harder." The younger generation has the disadvantage of not living in times of adversity that they do not understand that they take things for granted, which explains some of the behaviour of young Singaporeans these days. The young Singaporeans may be incalcated with the ideology of what is suitable for the present, but they twist it to what is suitable for me and not for the country at the present. Clearly, I think that this is why national education was imposed for a period of time.<br><br>On your second point regarding the education, I agree with you that there are merits and disadvantages to our education system. Let me offer you an opinion told to me from my friend who works as a JC teacher. The Ministry of Education is constantly changing the policies so fast that the colleges could not follow up. For example, in 1998, they advocated IT education as the imperative way to enhance the student's learning career, and then in 1999, they changed to knowledge based economy. The students don't suffer from any change, and of course, make complains all the time. The poor teachers under the "whip" of the principal have to work out new plans to these formulated policies. Besides, what's worse, there are JC principals who are so obssessed with their ranking that they totally ignore the student's education. A principal from one of the top 5 JCs once told a trainee teacher that she is not interested in whether a student learns the subject properly, and she only wants A grades. U have it, a bunch of top JC students with good grades and no brains. Sad, isn't it, the principal fails her basic role as an educator. Like you, I believe that education is the only way that we can ensure the next generation a fighting chance to deal with the challenges of the world. However, the implementation of the education is what I feel should be the issue. We can have education in quantity, but not in quality which is the present state of affairs in the country.<br><br>On your third point in regards to foreign talent, I believe that it is right to import foreign talent and we have to because our population do not have enough talent to take up some of the jobs in the country which are highly specialized. What I think is the problem, the government do not make the effort of getting back the good talent. Imagine that they have to buy back a maverick Singaporean, Prof Fong Shih, the current director of IMRE and Vice-chancellor of NUS, who got only poly-education and made it to be the top 100 scientists of US, at a higher price. How many of these mavericks are we going to lose in order for the government to see the need of investing in local talent more? They talked about their scholarships which I believed are just legal contracts, which offer no room for expansion to the scholar. That is why the government lose smart people like Hector Yee (the guy is very well-known in Cornell for being good in computer science by people there) and to think, they got branded as bondbreakers.<br><br>In regards to the Pre-U sem incident, actually, most of the cohort in that time (1991) are cynical to the next lap. A friend of mine once said that the government pay so much for the students to go for these propaganda and indoctrination only to get us hitting them more and more. They are not going to do anything about it, and that is reflected by one of the 5 speakers in the main session, and after his talk which is highly enlightening and sarcastic (to both the students and government), he said in a similar manner that no matter what changes we are going to make in this grandeur plan (the next lap), it would not be in a short time, and we cannot overhaul things which we want so much to change and he cited the example of the education system (because the students are actively attacking him on the education system). He use this line which all of us adopted in the end,"because that's the way it is." to somehow tell us that we cannot change certain things.<br><br>I don't think I am going to stay in Singapore in the next 5-10 years, because I am carving my niche out there where the opportunities are. Unfortunately, Singapore offer no opportunities to people of my profession now, but perhaps in the future. If I can make it out there, perhaps, they will buy me back with the money... After all, I am the Prodigal..<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Terence and blueturbo :<br><br>I share the sentiments with Terrence's reply that there is a right to comment on your own country. However, what I think about people who are critics, subscribe to the only talk but no action attitude, or what I call a political apathy attitude. I don't subscribe to that kind of attitude that you can do nothing about it. I prefer to seek a solution to deal with problems, instead of blowing a molehill out of a social problem like Hello-Kitty and Half-Life. There are more imperative problems like employment and domestic issues regarding costs of living in Singapore.<br><br>I beg to differ with Terrence in the issue of Confucianism in being a sham. I mentioned once before, when a philosophy is modified or corrupted in order to fit into the context of the society, it is no longer consider a true philosophy anymore. In this case, most Asian governments don't practice proper Confucianism. It is like Marx's manifesto on communism. According to Marx's theory, there are three stages in communism : first the people revolt, second, a temporary government is installed to redistribute the resources, work and wealth of the country to the people, finally, the government return the power to the people. Most of the communist countries failed once when they reached the second stage, because of the famous Lord Acton's saying,"Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely", they coveted the power and turned it into an tyrannical and authoritative regime. Because a government which failed to achieve the state as created by an ideology, the fault does not lie on the ideology but the people who implement the ideology and corrupt them to their own uses. I believed that humans are essentially selfish, and hence it is impossible to achieve the state which communism or Confucianism is set out to do.<br><br>I used the above analogy to illustrate my disagreement with your argument is that you are blaming the present problems of many Asian societies on a philosophy where the governments have re-modified or corrupted its original ideology into something different. I consider the Singaporean goverment more of a legalist government rather a government which purports Confucianism. Because in the legalism context, the law makers invoked fear to the people in order to make them obey and worked in their capitalist interests. I think that the major criticism to the philosophy would be certain ideals of morally good and legislative government which cannot be reached and in that case, your criticism is valid only in that context.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Prodigal,<br><br>You attribute several assumptions to me. And they are, in order of appearance (drumroll)Â…..<br><br>1. Â“However, what I think about people who are critics, subscribe to the only talk but no action attitude, or what I call a political apathy attitude.Â”<br>Firstly, and this is more semantics than anything else my boy, Â‘criticsÂ’ do not possess Â‘apathyÂ’.  To criticise, my boy, one has to have an antagonistic viewpoint with regard to another, and apathy does not afford one. Secondly my boy, not all critics refuse to take action. Furthermore the act of Â‘actionÂ’ is a separate activity from that of Â‘criticismÂ’ and there is no reason why a critic cannot take action Â– hence Â‘actionÂ’ may be a potential instead of current activity. So my boy, since you do not know the nature of civil activities I partake in nor the civil commitments I have, given the fact that you do not know me, should not assume that I or all or even most critics do not plan action. (IÂ’m being flippant about this because this does not affect my initial argument.)<br><br>2. Â“In this case, most Asian governments don't practice proper Confucianism.Â”<br>I argued that the usage of Confucian as an ideological tool was a political construction convenient for the deposits and attribution of post-revolution capitalist necessities. Whether it is a sham or not practised properly is not my concern. Rather, I am pointing out the manner in which it is politically employed to justify or legitimise economic and social phenomenon.<br><br>3. Â“I believed that humans are essentially selfish, and hence it is impossible to achieve the state which communism or Confucianism is set out to do.Â”<br>So where do we go from here? Essentially selfish? Impossible to achieve? Smells like apathy to me.<br><br>4. Â“I consider the Singaporean government more of a legalist government rather a government which purports Confucianism.Â”<br>The Singapore government is legalistic AND Confucian in cultural and ethical propaganda. The two may be autonomous of each other and yet go hand in hand.<br><br>5. Â“Because in the legalism context, the law makers invoked fear to the people in order to make them obey and worked in their capitalist interests.Â”<br>Why the heck do you need laws to MAKE people work? Are not hunger and poverty incentives enough? Do you need a law to get people to indulge in their capitalist interest? IsnÂ’t making money as natural as breathing to mercantile folk? Even if you mean ordering people to work for other peopleÂ’s profit this cannot be the case since capitalism by nature is about free labour (i.e. free to work here or somewhere else unlike feudalism) and not forced labour.<br><br>cheers<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think I've written enuf previously about how I disapprove of S'pore's system, and I shall not elaborate. But on the point of education, I'm in favour of the idea of having intensive academic learning as oppose to creative learning. I know some will disagree, but even though young kids are the mot creative among all as their minds hv not yet been shaped by too many social principles, I must stress the need for intensive academic education during a kid's younger days is important to improve their knowledge base, thus even though I truly hate the s'pore system, I must say I feel that the Primary and Secondary education system works well. Can't say the same about JCs, Polies, and Unis.<br><br>Above are not my main purpose of posting. Just trying to join in the talks of Terence, Prodigal and blueturbo.<br><br>1. Agree with Terence on point 1. 1 irrelevant qn: What is semantics?<br><br>2. Terence, Prodigal was right on this that the ideology of Communism and Confucianism were modified by politicians to satisfy their own agenda. While you've agreed on this point, your next sentence that whether they are practised properly are none of your concern is kinda irresponsible(Apathy here huh!). While you hv your rights to disregard whether ideologies were modified for political agendas, what I must say is that modified confucianism is NOT confucianism, and modified communism is NOT communism. I believe we do hv a social responsibility to differenciate them.<br><br>3. The fact is that human IS selfish and IT IS impossible to achieve those ideologies with selfish people. Theres no apathy involve here. This I believe is a fact and nothing can be done.<br><br>4. Just want to clarify something... when did Singapore govt ever practice confucianism??? I'm confused... u mean those Courtesy campaigns? Maybe they practice ConfuSianism... thats why I'm so confuse now...<br><br>5. For this point, I think both of you have your points. Will try to differenciate. What terence was trying to put across is that people need not be force into working for a living, which is true enough. But what Prodigal was trying to say was that the legal system was put into place in order to restrict people's behaviour(The most extreme eg.The Internal Security Act) for the govt's capitalist interest, which I fully agree. So thats 2 different things altogether.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Going for lunch... the above posting hv not been re-read, thus I apologise for any misinterpretations, wrong spelling(as usual), etc. bye!<br><br>------------------<br>Whens the end coming?

            <div class='col-md body'>Well Terence:<br><br>A first disclaimer to your arguments is that I do not make judgements on your character based on your arguemnets on certain things. What I disagree with you, is your way of interpreting something.<br><br>1. "Firstly, and this is more semantics than anything else my boy, Â‘criticsÂ’ do not possess Â‘apathyÂ’.  To criticise, my boy, one has to have an antagonistic viewpoint with regard to another, and apathy does not afford one."<br><br>I don't see that there are any semantics at work. Semantics is when you deal with somebody's argument with a twist of words. A good example of argument by semantics can be seen in some of the posts make by the pogenitor of the thread in Christianity. In the case of my argument, I have make a generalization of some people. I have known people who are always criticising about things but do nothing when I asked for a solution. Yes, you may be different in your real life. Similarly, I can tell everyone here that I do this so and so on. But it does not add anything to your credibility because you have not explained to me how you are going to provide solutions to the problems which are raised earlier in this thread.<br><br>I agree with you fundamentally that there is a difference between criticism and action. In my point of view, the action is the next step after the criticism. Most people criticise and complain but do not go to the next stage. If you are what you say you are that you will take action and find a solution to problems, then there is some hope for Singapore.<br><br>2)In reference to your second point about Confucianism, you pointed out that whether it<br>"sham or not practised properly" does not matter. That in my opinion, is a very poor argument. Let me offer you a simple analogy to see where the fault of your argument lies. Suppose I am a politician, and make a declaration that my government would practice the system purported by democracy, but in the process, I control the people by my tyranny and authoritative manner which is more authortitarian in perspective. Notice that the word "democracy" is abused here and merely used as a label to dress up what the true form of politics I practised which is tyranny and regimental. A government can choose to justify and legitimise his economy or social phenomenon by adopting and labelling an ideology, which is where your argument about the ideology of Confucianism being a sham here. Somehow, I have to make a proposition to you to read the actual Confucian texts like "Analects", "Mencius", "Great Learning" and "Doctrine of the Mean" to see for yourself what Confucianism really is before making any form of judgements.<br><br>3)On your third point, I don't see any apathy when I pointed out human selfishless. Well, the ideology of controlling a state taken up by Machievelli and Lee Zong Wu can be well used to achieve the control of the state. Look at the real world now, are you going to tell me that every government including the United States is practicising the version of Aristotle's democracy? Do not kid ourselves with such ideal fantasy, because our models of reality are merely approximations but not the true picture of what our reality really are. Our present world is driven by capitalism and the ideology which I think most people are driven is by materialism.<br><br>Well, I will deal with your 4th and 5th point of argument after I go back for my lectures and do some work in my lab...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Prodigal,<br><br>Before you return from your lectures and address my 4th and 5th  point, let me address your 1st, 2nd and 3rd point before I go for my seminars.  IÂ’ve rented out my drum set so no drumroll, <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>1. Â“I don't see that there are any semantics at work. Semantics is when you deal with somebody's argument with a twist of words.Â”<br>Semantics is not a twist of words. Very simply its just a linguistic logic concern with the nature of meaning. To be apathetic is to be uninterested, uncaring and unenthusiastic. To be a critic is to be one who expresses an unfavourable opinion of something. As such the meaning behind those words put them in polemical positions of definition to each other. If one is uninterested how can one afford have an unfavourable opinion?<br><br>2. "sham or not practised properly" does not matter. That in my opinion, is a very poor argument.Â”<br>It does not matter because I am not interested seeing if the philosophical truths of Confucianism are indeed practised by SÂ’pore or its government i.e. whether the purity of Confucianism is maintained in day to day ruling. I am not a Confucian scholar and it would be tricky to apply ethical codes in human relationships to the relationship between structure and agency. IÂ’m more interested in its deployment as an ideological tool as a political construction convenient for the deposits and attribution of post-revolution capitalist necessities and construction of identity when engaged in global trade with the big boys. (Maya, I think IÂ’ve answered your query?)<br><br>3. IÂ’m unsure as to why you are saying this but I agree with you on the point you are trying to make i.e. there are no perfect models of political systems in practice today. However, if you think people are essentially selfish are we doomed to always suffer the caprice of our rulers?<br><br>Cheers<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Terence,<br><br>I am finally back from lectures, and before I start my research work.<br><br>4.  "Confucian in cultural and ethical propaganda." In regards to your 4th point, my objection is what do you mean by Confucian in cultural and ethical propaganda? In the true Confucian  philosophy, the government sets the example for the people to follow, and the government do not tell the people what to follow. Propaganda is the indoctrination of the general public through various means, and there is a distinction with proper education. The Confucianist government believes in education and the teaching of students in all points of view, and not teaching of students with distorted information.<br><br>5. In regards to your fifth point, I have nothing to dispute, but I need to clarify something. What I meant by a legalist government is that the government controls the country with strong and strict laws which the people have to abide by, but the people are run by a meritocratic system in their workplaces, because as you have said capitalism is about free labour. There is no point imposing fear on the people because they are already driven by the fear of poverty and the pursuit of material interests.<br><br>I will reserve your next three points (at least I must think about what you have said before answering) to a later time, when I finished at least one thing on my schedule...

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Proddy,<br><br>Ok, back from seminar, lets see what we have here. Just out of professional courtesy, what kind of research are you doing?<br><br>4. Â“"Confucian in cultural and ethical propaganda." In regards to your 4th point, my objection is what do you mean by Confucian in cultural and ethical propaganda?Â”<br>What I mean about Confucianism in cultural and ethical propaganda is the socio-political Â‘dialecticÂ’ between the establishment and people that results in the objectification (not subjectification) of Confucianism as a mainstream discourse in the political and economic arena. Above I argued that the post-revolutionary (I think postcolonial may be a better description) context was a struggle of ideological forces in which nebulous states and Communism were the major players. Social order and cohesion, promised by both, were requisites of industrialisation, again promised by both albeit vis-Ã -vis the rhetoric of capitalism on one hand, and on the other, an even distribution of wealth.<br><br>I am saying that the spectre of colonialism at that time was alive and kicking (still is from the looks of Â‘ang mo better than meÂ’ posts elsewhere) such that it constituted a ready-made framework which pre-conditioned the political and economic discourse deployed to articulate a new and self-defining identity. The mercantile instincts of the Chinese diaspora were complimentary to capitalism and not Communism. This allowed a psychic-cultural valve for the transmission of Chinese heritage, partly to combat the spectre of colonialism and partly to be hedged against our neighbouring Muslim Â‘friendsÂ’. This paved the way for bywords like Â‘ConfucianismÂ’, Â‘traditional valuesÂ’ (what the heck is a traditional value?) and Â‘Eastern ethicsÂ’. If we study the binary relationship of forces during the early period of transition, we may (will) find state-induced capitalism very skilfully employed Confucianism and all things traditional as raison dÂ’etre of postcolonial independence when the more simple explanation of it as ideology for social mobilisation for the attraction of external capitalism is available and more accurate.<br><br>Bochup,<br><br>As you can see the term Â‘practiceÂ’ is under debate here. A safer word would be Â‘preachÂ’ Confucianism. Look at the text of LKYÂ’s speech in the early 90s or any economic journal that describes the Asian Miracle and/or Crisis.<br><br>cheers<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Terence,<br><br>Well, I have to keep my field of research a secret, since I have to keep a secret identity, if not, all hell will break loose and we would not be able to continue this discussion. When I am to meet you, I will reveal to you what I do and why I cannot say much about myself. Meanwhile, let us come back to the pending issue which I have spent some time thinking about.<br><br>1. I will go back to the issue of semantics. When you first mentioned the word, I made the error to interpret that you meant that I was using the twist of words in my arguments. My apologies. Since, you have given your definition of apathy, I will give you mine. My definition of apathy is just people being uninterested in matters which concerned them. In the context of this discussion, I have used apathy in the context of social and political  side as people who are only complaining but have not seek to provide the solution to the problem i.e. they are not doing anything about it. Now that you and I have flashed out our definitions. For once, I will stick to your definition of apathy in order to facilitate a better discussion. In that case, I will have no objections or further comments to your last point you made on this issue.<br><br>2. Yet, I have to stand firm on this issue. The deployment of the ideology by the government is a different issue to the discussion. My only objection to your point that Confucianism is a sham lies on the fact that you have no knowledge of what the actual philosophy is all about.<br><br>MayaJade has pointed out in the thread that you are pursuing the effects of the political ideology which is labelled as Confucianism and demostrate that it is a sham because of the effects brought upon by the implementation of the ideology. Bochup and I objected to that, because you are taking the entire set (which consists of both pure and corrupted Confucianism) and claimed that they are a sham. Hence we brought up the arguments that we do not agree by illustrating what pure Confucianism purports. It will be helpful if you would tell us whether you would say that true Confucianism is a sham as well. Otherwise, we are on 2 different platforms arguing on 2 different issues.<br><br>From my observation, what you claimed as sham is the corrupted version of Confucianism. It is alright that you have not read any books on Confucianism, because I do not insist to put the lack of information on your part.<br><br>I think it is important that you should carefully distinguish when you make certain statements like "I think the whole 'Asian Values', 'traditional values', 'Confucian Ethics' is a sham." I was reading Ng's reply against John Wong in the other thread, and after a lot of flames, then he shifted his premise that he was not referring to the religion but the institution that implements the religion. Perhaps, he did not actually get so much flame war going on if he has made himself clear earlier on.<br><br>4. I will deal with your 4th and 5th point together, because they are closely linked together. First of all, when the colonies uder the British rule decided to seek independence, they needed to reformulate an ideology so that they have a reason to gain independence. In the same context, I am inclined to agree that Southeast Asia on the whole have not totally thrown away the colonial baggage. The reason is because the governments need to instill fear upon the people so that they would work in the line of their interests. Afterall, politics is not an arena of morals, it is an arena of interests. In the case of the politicians who have to start the government after they declare independence, they decide to adopt the strategy which I would term as Machiavellian. Now that the population have achieved their objectives and then they began to wonder why they have been following on that goal of not being under any colonial masters anymore, the government needs to re-deploy a new strategy.<br><br>From what I see now, Singapore is the only country which is shifting towards another kind of ideology since it has achieved economic affluence. Unfortunately, the government seem to have reshaped this new ideology like the past. It used to be the British way which we follow, now that Britain is no longer a super power, so they encourage us to be pro-American. It reminds me of the saying by Jodie Foster in "Anna and the King" when she say,"The Ways of the British are the ways of the world", and now, the Singapore government have changed the statement to "the ways of the American are the ways of the world". But this is not true. I believe that the smarter people of the country would know that not everyone supports the America's present dominance. I will suppose that there will be still the same post-colonial type of setting in Southeast Asia, until Asia is able to stand up on her feet.<br><br>Our only hope is to influence the future generations with the ideas that they would change the rigid system in our country. How do we do that? By education, and we can somehow get contacts with people whom we know  are going to be in power next time, and give them the ideas, I am sure that things will change. Perhaps, the upper levels do not realize that the changes they instituted upon, takes a long time before they could see results. One of the major problems, is that they want economic returns in every single cent they spent. In my opinion, the whole idea of cultural cultivation by drama and arts are more sham, and it goes as well, for making NUS and NTU "world class" universities.<br><br>I think that the only success of the present government is the fact that they are able to survive the Asian crisis. You will be surprised that my American friend (who worked in the Federal government of USA), pursuing a degree in economics, have asked me about our CPF system works, and told me how impressed he was with the performance of Singapore during the crisis. Similarly, the opinion was the same among the economists whom I know in my university.<br><br>Maybe we do not agree with the methods used. But let me pose you an issue that is raised across the thread but not brought into light. "Do you believe that the ends justify the means?". In my perspective, yes, the ends justify the means because we are talking about the survival of the country as a whole, not a few individuals. Maybe you have a different opinion, and I am gladly to hear it from Terence and anyone of you.<br><br>Have a good day, live well and prosper.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Proddy,<br><br>DonÂ’t know if weÂ’ll meet cause I donÂ’t go down to London very often.<br><br>The crux of my argument was that Confucianism was a means for social mobilisation and cohesion during the period of transition as a result of ideological turmoil as caused by nebulous state capitalism and Communism. This social mobilisation and cohesion was necessary for foreign capitalism i.e. foreign investment. For the sake of foreign investment, Confucian ethics was preached to promote work ethics, family ties, respect for authority and submission. Later the agents of foreign capitalism began to associate economically prudent traits like high savings rate and re-investment as part of a historic/cultural genealogy of Asia. It doesnÂ’t matter to my argument at all if Â‘pureÂ’ Confucianism was modified hereto I am not justified in calling it a sham since the purity of Confucianism is not in question here. I called it a sham because I showed how the ideological turmoil of transition has been forgotten as the origin for the germination of Confucianism instead of a happy smooth and natural product of the Chinese diaspora. We accept it because of the psychical-cultural ties to China and our ethnicity.<br><br>I donÂ’t agree that the cultural scene in SÂ’pore is a sham. There are very dedicate people who believe in what they do. For theatre, look at The Necessary Stage and Theatreworks (the latter has its far share of populist shit like Â‘Army DazeÂ’ I concede but populist shit is necessary to fund the more avant-garde productions). However I do agree that the governmental project of making SÂ’pore a Renaissance City is a total sham. The EDBÂ’s idea of culture is bringing in stuff like Â‘Phantom of the OperaÂ’ and Â‘Les MiserablesÂ’ only because they make money. I also think Philip Yeo is a narrow-minded philistine who wouldnÂ’t know culture if it bit him in the arse.<br><br>I am appalled that you say the ends justify the means. Does this mean morality and values go out the window when they get in the way of what we want to achieve?<br><br>cheers<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Terence<br><br>Well, as for meeting, we see when all of the people in UK are free, then we will try to coordinate a weekend where we can meet.<br><br>While reading your arguments, I also needed to point out that I have a high regard about the drama scene in Singapore. A late Scottish friend who is involved in theatre told me that he was very impressed by Theatreworks for the plays they staged in London once. He was telling me that Singaporean plays have very good themes. For that once, I thought I am one of the few people who appreciated the drama by this drama group.<br><br>I have no objections or comments to further the case on Confucianism being a sham, because I think we are both arguing on different things. My arguments would be more relevant in Ng's earlier thread on Confucianism.<br><br>The last thing which has "appalled" you, was the statement. I brought up this because I had a tight debate before writing the reply to you in a cafe after dinner with a political scientist  who is a Machiavellian supporter together with another sociologist on this issue. We were discussing what are the important qualities which a political leader should possess, and "the ends justify the means" comes into the argument.<br><br>First of all, I will set the stage for what I define as "the ends justify the means" argument is about. What I want to advocate is the case where a political leader need to make certain sacrifices in order to achieve the big picture. Yes, I agree with you that morality and values are very important to this issue. My support for this argument is in the reference frame of a political leader.<br><br>Let me cite an example on morality. Lee Shi Min who became the second emperor of Tang Dynasty, slayed his brothers in a rebellion, but become a benevolent and good ruler in the end. One may condemn him for being ruthless to usurp the throne from his brothers. The reason given by analysts is that his brothers were not good generals and things would have been much worse if either one of them has gotten the throne. In this case, the ends of achieving an empire where the people enjoyed peace for another 100 years justify the means where Lee has to kill his own brothers (which is an immoral act).<br><br>I have not properly formulated the arguments totally, but will much appreciate if you can play the devil's advocate and see how the thread goes from here. It may turn out to be one of the debate motions I have in my Uni.. Others may join in the debate here.<br><br>Enjoy yourself.<br><br></div>
