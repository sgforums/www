            <div class='col-md body'>I'm surprise and please that this thread is getting more in depth... shall add my 2 cents worth regarding the topic of "ends justify the means".<br><br>While times are different and international environment hv changed, I must say that Political Personnality traits remain the same thru' the years. You don't see people killing each other for the leadership of the country nowadays(or at least not as often) becos of the different succession process.<br><br>There used to be a saying that with normal people, you can enjoy riches together, but not hardship. With Political leaders, you can enjoy hardship together, but not riches. This is becos if you've made too big a name for yourself, you've become a threat to the leader himself.<br><br>If we look back at Chinese History, all successions to throne are always full of in-fighting between the successors-to-be. Li Shi Ming didn't just slain his siblings(well, if he didn't, his siblings will kill him anyway!), he brought troops to the emperor(i.e. his dad) palace and said he was there to protect him from the revolt. The fact was that this act is for threatening his dad to retire and pass the throne to him.<br><br>Yong Zheng(Qian Long's father) emperor forced his siblings to death for fear of insubordination and revolt. But he was a good emperor himself, who worries about his own people.<br><br>What I must say is that in normal circumstances, Morals and Values are important to shape the societies, but when it comes to mamoth issues like political leadership, morals and values shd be thrown out of the window... if you can't get a strong leadership, the country will decline anyway. Guess I've put my stand in that I do believe in "ends justifying the means".<br><br>Morals and values are for time of peace, but in politics, there is no peace. All politicians are at war all the time with each other, so they can't really care too much about values. and don't try to kid me that political leaders hv morals... Morals and values are what political leaders use to rule the country, whether they believe or not is another issue altogether.<br><br>emmm... getting a bit long again... will add if required.<br><br>------------------<br>Whens the end coming?

            <div class='col-md body'>Bish... I think you should quit reading "San Guo Yan Yi" and start reading "San Guo Zhi". San Guo Yan Yi is more of a story telling version of the three kingdom history, and it is very much distorted. While Liu Bei is not that Moral and Charismatic, Cao Cao is not really bad and evil, just that in a story, they need to hv a bad guy to make the story interesting. But got to warn you first, San Guo Zhi is very boring and shd only be meant for people truly interested in history.<br><br>Maybe this part will help illustrate: In San Guo Yan Yi, during the earlier days when Cao Cao hv yet to conquer the northern regions and was at war with Yuan Shao, the story relates Cao Cao as a charismatic person who is upright and charismatic, while Yuan Shao is portrayed as a dick head who knows only how to provoke his own generals into defection.<br><br>In the later part of the story, when Cao Cao began his war with Liu Bei, Cao Cao then became an evil ruler with no morals at all. Thats how the story goes.<br><br>And there are strong beliefs that Guan Yu actually slept with Liu Bei's wife when held in captive by Cao Cao, just that Liu Bei needs Guan Yu for fighting the war and he tolerated with it.<br><br>And before Liu Bei died, he called Zhuge Liang to his bedside and told him that if Liu Chan is not a good ruler, dethrone and make himself the ruler. U think Liu Bei was being wise by suggesting this? He was testing Zhuge Liang's loyalty, and if he detected any signs that Zhuge Liang will take over as ruler, he wud hv decapitate Zhuge Liang right on the spot. U think why Zhuge Liang was full of fear when he heard Liu Bei saying this, becos he knew the catch there.<br><br>I know these are quite difficult to swallow for those who didn't know... I didn't feel good at first... anyway, these are what historians believe, and they hv no proof... just their deductions.<br><br>------------------<br>Whens the end coming?

            <div class='col-md body'>Proddy and Bochup,<br><br>I donÂ’t know if I want to go down to London just for one day. You wanna put me up for the weekend? Heheh. Anyway,<br><br>If we agree that morals and values are the building blocks of ideology (Confucianism or anything else) then the integrity of these morals and values must be sustained through means and acts that achieve a desired end or else the ideology would not have a moral foundation to stand on.<br><br>The example of Lee Shih Min is an honest attempt but not good enough nor appropriate in a contemporary context.<br>1. Political and economic stability is desirable Â– but the question is what is the price you are willing to pay for them? If sweeping away morals and values aside for a while whilst constructing a system of governance is acceptable, then on what ground are they re-installed? Can they again be swept aside for other purposes as well? Also, isnÂ’t the installation and re-installation of ideology for specific ends another version of a government employing Confucianism as ideology as cultural control? In other words, the contamination of pure Confucianism (as represented by absolute values and morals) is made easier with the notion that the means justify the ends since we can do away with them whenever we want.<br><br>2. In the light of technological advances, the Lee Shih Min episode will not happen again because society has greater mobilisation. New localities for meeting and discourse have sprung up via the internet and overseas mobility hence providing more opportunities for resistance. The masses of ancient China and those of today are different entities because of mass education and financial stakes in the country and as such will not subside into acquiescence, as did those in China. The scrutiny of the international community will also provide consideration for a blatant sweeping away of morals and values. A Â‘violentÂ’ revolt or struggle for the seat of the throne today can only be exercised when the dominant ideology legitimises a code of ethics in which materialism, submission and Â‘respectÂ’ are advocated; this will prevent the masses from an uprising in response to this struggle for power amongst leaders.<br><br>cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Terence,<br><br>usually in the case of any human beings, we hv morals of differing standards in different areas. For eg, a person can be very evil in his treatment of others, but treats his own family and frens very well.<br><br>In the case of leaders, the important personality trait to have is the will to grind out results that benefit the nation. The ability to spot and implement the right policies at the right time is most important for the country. Morals and values will come secondary in my opinion. While saying these, I must stress that leaders can still promote ideologies despite the fact that they themselves are mere hypocrites.  Just look at Bill Clinton.<br><br>The fact is that Morals and ideology will always hv their ground to stand in the name of good social teaching, and politically correct behaviours among your peers will always put you in a better light when compared to others who refused to adhere to norms. Look at Mahathir and Anwar case. Did you ever see Mahathir disregarding morals and values? In fact if all things are true, he is actually upholding the morals of the cabinet, but will anyone believe those stuff are really true? So much about morals and values.<br><br>A bit disoriented typing this, cos I'm juggling between work and forum posting. Hope I get my message across.

            <div class='col-md body'>Practicing moral discrimination or selectivity is very dangerous. There is no common moral foundation on which the person bases his decision on. If you see no problems with that, then you should also see no problems with Confucianism being manipulated to achieve public ends.<br><br>We are still imbued with the spirit of mercantilism and this shapes the perspective of our world. To us, economic success overrides and justifies anything else. Let me paint you a scenario. LetÂ’s say a major MNC decides to make it HQ in SÂ’pore and promises to bring in millions (EDB is kissing its arse as well). LetÂ’s say, this MNC wants to build its factory over a small nature reserve. The question then arises Â– how much is our nature reserve worth? How much dough would the MNC bring in to make destroying the reserve worth while?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Terrence and Bochup and all other friends,<br><br>It has been a bad day yesterday and I decided to take a day off by walking around the countryside and pubbing later (I have 5 pints of Hoegarden), hence I have not posted any reply to the issue. Well, Terence, I don't stay in London, but a small town which is 1 hr northeast of London. But if you want to drop by my place, I can always be glad to be of host. Just email me.<br><br>Meanwhile coming back to the issue, I have seen the various rebuttals put up by Bochup and Terence. Let me further my case by using more modern examples in 2 perspectives : one, the political perspective and two, the domestic perspective.<br><br>From the first, I will talk about certain choices made by political leaders. For example, we knew of the declaration of war to Iraq by the united coalition in order to restore Kuwait's sovereignty. However, despite the fact, the West, particularly, the United States, have to send their men possibly to die, hence, the cause is justified. Another example would the NATO bombing to Yugoslavia, in order to stop ethnic cleansing. Now from the above the two examples, we are seeing the bigger picture at work. In order to achieve an aim which may be commonly agreed among all that it would be the way, we do it. Notice that I do not use morally here, for one reason, I think that the question which we are here to discuss cannot involve an absolute moral high ground. I am more inclined to set my premise that morals are a set of values which are selected by the society of that particular period.<br><br>Of course, I will not choose to evade the issue that political leaders have also made an entire country to suffer for their own selfish ends. This is where we see the abuse of the "ends justify the means". Cases of abuse would involve people like Saddam Hussein and the Yugoslavian president and many others. Hence we can see the magnitude of damage, which in this case, the ends do not justify the means.<br><br>On a more domestic example, I will use the case of abortion to subtantiate my argument on why the ends should justify the means in very specific cases. I agreed with Terence that moral selectivity is something dangerous  in certain cases, but nevertheless agree with Bochup on the whole that there are situations which require a moral selectivity. Let me illustrate the example using abortion, now let's suppose we agree on the ideal that abortion should not be done because it involved the killing of a life, a foetus. However, there are specific cases, where the woman is raped and suffered from discrimination and trauma that she should abort the child in order to help her to live a life. In that case, it is justified. After all, we are talking about the life of a raped victim here. Nevertheless, I am against with people who aborted their child out of irresponsibility. In the example which I constructed, I am perfectly clear that the ends of helping the raped victim is justified by the means of an abortion, but that is a very specific case which I am talking about. Still, it still supports the case on the issue "why the ends justify the means".<br><br>Finally, after exploring the 2 perspectives, I come back to the issue of political leaders. If one has carefully read Lee Zong Wu's "Thick Black book", what the author is trying to purport is the ideology of a good political leader. He laterally breaks down what a good political leader must possess into 2 discrete values : a black heart and a thick skin. His analogy is that Cao Cao succeeded because he has the Machiavellian attitude, that he would rather betray the whole world than to let the whole world betray him, and Liu Bei succeeded because he has a thick skin and is a whiner and has successfully used his tears to win good generals to his service, and Zhuge Liang not to take away his son's empire by abuse of loyalty and moral rights. However, we have to understand that the kind of person which Lee Zong Wu is purporting is totally a person without emotions, who would sacrifice anything to justify his means, to what people called,"liu1 qin1 bu4 ren4" (breaking of all 6 types of kinship). Of course, he do not stop with the examples and subsequently talked about the founder of Han dynasty, Liu Bang, who broke an agreement and unified the empire by eliminating Xiang Yu in the process. How do we do that in the modern context? Can we see examples of good political leaders which has both thick and black values? The abuse of an ideology to bigger perspective can be seen as an example.<br><br>As for now, I need to rush for my lecture classes. Hopefully, I will see new developments to the discussion we have moved on so far..<br><br>[This message has been edited by prodigal (edited 04 February 2000).]</div>

The evils of Saddam were told and re-told ad nauseam while the West galloped in on its white horse with its moral trumpets to save the day. The annexation of Kuwait by Iraq was justified under Â‘ancient lawsÂ’ which claimed that Kuwait was part of Iraq Â– this we know is a trumped up excuse, but to similarly believe that the West only went to war for altruistic purposes is to be just as naÃ¯ve. Decisive action was taken because of the oil in Kuwait. IraqÂ’s annexation would mean that part of the worldÂ’s oil supply would be threatened and that Iraq would grow in military and economic strength from the oil revenues. This was unacceptable to the West, especially America, because of the fundamentalist and ideological threat Iraq is deemed to present. You say that you did not use the word Â‘morallyÂ’ here but the message you want to get across Â– the Gulf war was justified Â– is in nature a moral call.<br><br>2. It is not a matter of moral selectivity when someone chooses abortion after a rape. It is a matter of moral priority Â– the physical and/or emotional health of the mother OVER the life of an unplanned child. According to you, you justify abortion under this circumstance AS Â‘selectivityÂ’ which implies deciding what morals to employ under a given situation. I disagree with that Â– it is moral priority that is THE justification, i.e. affixing different levels of value to different things and objects. A pregnant rape victim does not go through a process of cordoning-off a realm of morality and mentally calculating the different versions of morality she should employ. Rather, she has an innate system of morals and values that have been assigned to different acts and thoughts. Through cultural and social conditioning, she has a system of moral and value hierarchy that places certain things over another Â– and in this case her well-being is more important than the unwanted child. This is moral priority Â– and it is very fundamentally different from moral selectivity.<br><br>WeÂ’ve veered off the original topic Â– SÂ’poreanÂ’s are happy automatons under all-encompassing regulations.<br><br>cheers<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Terence:<br><br>By all means, you can bring your drum roll, and I will take you to the bar where I worked to perform...<br><br>1)Well, that is the reason why I refuse to use the word moral in the argument, if you have really understood what I meant earlier. In my first point, I have made a statement that we should attempt to argue by standing on a high moral ground because it is not the right thing to do. The reason for that, is because politics is not an arena of morals, but an arena of interests. I justify the reason for the course of action taken by the West to bomb and attack Iraq is based on the premise that everyone agreed on what should be done. Suppose we follow the representation of the event as Terence has suggested about Iraq claiming sovereignty over Kuwait, and the world agreed that there is nothing wrong, then it would be justified from the point of Iraq. However, what I point out here, is that everyone agreed on the context that we should not annex another country. This is what I meant in the term moral selectivity. The problem we are all going to run into, if we argue in a moral high ground, is that we will  try to pounce on each other on an universal set of morality, which I don't think that we can ever come to the agreement to. I am more inclined to take the premise that morals are a set of values or an ideology that is selected by the society to ensure that anarchy would not occur.<br><br>2) If it follows from your premise that it is a issue of moral priority, then why is that we can allow the mother to be given the choice whether to abort or not. I think that both sides (you and I) have to agree that we are considering the case where the mother has a choice or not. Suppose she has a choice, the issue would be moral selectivity, because she decide that her own well being is better than having the baby to remind of her trauma. If we are to make the decision, suppose if the mother do not have the proper psychological condition to handle, then it is a matter of moral priority.<br><br>Despite we have veered off the original topic, I think that there is a lot of room for discussion. We can always start a new thread on another issue, but as it is, I like to stay on the same thread so that we can continue this exchange of ideas. Well, as for the automated Singaporeans, it's time for them to learn to think.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Proddy,<br><br>Hey there. Which part of London you in?<br><br>1. You wrote:<br>Â“I am more inclined to take the premise that morals are a set of values or an ideology that is selected by the society to ensure that anarchy would not occur.Â”<br><br>I wrote in much earlier post:<br>Â“I argued that the usage of Confucian as an ideological tool was a political construction convenient for the deposits and attribution of post-revolution capitalist necessities. Whether it is a sham or not practised properly is not my concern. Rather, I am pointing out the manner in which it is politically employed to justify or legitimise economic and social phenomenon.Â”<br><br>Correct me if IÂ’m wrong but IÂ’ve made you see the point I was trying to make all along? And if morals are different sets of ideologies for different societies Â– we cannot say there is an Ultimate right or wrong since morals are about what is right/wrong in a particular society Â– hence all morals have no autonomous truth-source, hence they are a sham??? Yes???<br><br>2. Â“If it follows from your premise that it is a issue of moral priority, then why is that we can allow the mother to be given the choice whether to abort or not.Â”<br><br>If its not up to the mother to abort then who else has the authority authority to decide? Moral priority is ascertained by the individual who, as I mention already, formulates his/her own hierarchy of morals. The decision to abort is not moral selectivity because she doesnÂ’t Â‘chooseÂ’ morals, rather she decides on the nature of the hierarchy of values she has developed.<br><br>3. As to why most Singaporeans are automatons?<br>Just look at the majority of posts here. They prefer the simple, non-mentally taxing issues. They seek simple answers without having the capacity or desire to pursue with logical de rigueur an issue to its conclusion. Most seek generic forms of explanations for everything and these explanations tend to be the most simple and non-problematic to swallow. Popular morality is also an influence. And so is the herd mentality.<br><br>cheers<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Terence,<br><br>Well, actually, the town I stay do not belong to London, but is somewhere near there. Like I say, it is northeast to London by 1 hour train. Email me and I will tell you where I really stay.<br><br>1)I have no disagreements to the point you made earlier. In my perspective, there are kinds of morality that an individual can adopt, either one, he takes the utilitarian perspective, to maximise the amount of happiness by looking after the majority, or take the Kantian stand, where you decide that there is an universal set of morals. Confucianism belong to the first class of what I classify as morals. Both are equally valid and have their own strengths and weaknesses in their systems. I once proposed that morals is subjective against an ethics philosopher, who countered my argument in a very fanciful manner. He selected the argument which adopts the following example, there is no way that a young German today could decide whether Hitler's actions are right and wrong, suppose if we take the utilitarian stand. Unless we are fixed in that situation, we may have to adopt the Kantian stand in order to make a moral decision. In that sense, the ends justify the means debate which we are having now, can be voiced down to one final argument : what kind of moral systems should we adopt? I am open to both systems, but I believed that if I am an administrator, I will adopt the utilitarian perspective, because the interests of the majority is more important than the minority. I am not being biased, but merely chose to maximise the amount of happiness of the society. There may exist an absolute moral truth, but as it stands for me, it cannot be proven, and similarly for the premise of the subjectivity of moral truths as well.<br><br>2) Unfortunately, I do not understand your rebuttal. I think it will be appropriate for me to ask you on clarifications of 3 terms which you have used prior to rebutt this argument : moral selectivity, moral hierarchy and moral priority, and please cite me an example, how different these 3 things are.<br><br>3) Well, I have come to accept that. One of the cynical reasons that people who are thinkers have to accept is that the majority of people are contented to know what they know and refused to venture further. I know that it sounds cruel. We can only hope that more of the Singaporeans could learn how to think. In my opinion, thinking Singaporeans are getting lesser, but more of them are just blindly following the crowd... That, by all senses, I agree with you wholeheartedly.<br><br>4)I think we can always make a psychological profile on the mentality of most posters here, and dissect what is the common herd mentality and what kind of issues they prefer to talk about. I see that recently, people are going into sexual topics, which to me is to provoke response, and I don't think it was ever geniunely trying to learn anything.<br><br>Gong Xi Fa Cai...<br><br></div>

The aurthor of book wrote something like he dream of Guan Yu, asking him not to write his only "dirty spot" in life in that book. He rgrets about the whole thing. I also have another book in which is about Zhuge Liang. He isn't as intelligent as he made up to be. And during the "Ci Pi Zi Zhan", he actually did nothing, just sit in the camp doing nothing! And many other things too. Now that I'm typing this, I realise that I left that book with a friend who has already gone to Australia to study!!!

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Moral selectivity Â– the ability to appropriate morals for a desired and preconceived end.<br>Moral hierarchy Â– A structured and tiered framework of morals where one value is given higher consideration than another.<br>Moral priority Â– the activation of values and morals from within the moral hierarchy.<br><br>A pregnant rape victim does not practice moral selectivity because the rape and pregnancy are enforced events upon the victim. To be able to practice moral selectivity there must be a notion of manipulating existing morals for a desired end. There is no notion of manipulation of morals in the decision to abort a child because the victim had no say in her pregnancy. It is strange to say that a victim only proceeds to abort after going through the selection of certain morals which justify abortion. Rather her decision to abort is based on the morals and values within her personal moral hierarchy which is in turn determined and conditioned by upbringing.<br><br>cheers<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all, slowly easing myself back to normal life after CNY.<br><br>Bish, glad you're doing your read-ups on Chinese History. Can't really agree with your point about the govt(Or was it LKY's point?). Won't discuss it here though...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Prody(mind I use this? Its shorter...)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>1)your point on majority's happiness is quite dangerous. I'm not saying you support this, but very often, the happiness of the majority is to belittle the minority, and in this case, does your policy of being practical per se leads to ethnic cleansing of the minority? Think about it... 99% of the people will be very happy if you get rid of this 1%... sounds good for me to control a country...<br><br>2)Terence, can I say that those who practice Moral Selectivity also hv their own hierarchy when practicing selections(u must hv a hierarchy in order to rank their importance, isn't it)? And if it is, what is the difference between Moral Selectivity and Moral Priority? The process of selecting will then be the process of prioritising.<br><br>3)There is 1 thing I must say, i.e. Singapore education is the most successful I've ever seen in the whole world, shaping people to the exact type which the govt wants them to be... amazing huh.... hmmm I need more engineers... reduce the school fees and share the cost among the other courses... sick autocratic system... and to think the students protested! I laughed my hearts out... at least they know how to protest... how about a letter to CASE?<br><br>4)Give them benefit of the doubt... and must say that earlier postings about sex by firewire and purr were very educational... and now that I talked about purr... seems like she is gone liao... didn't see her in forum for a very long time...<br><br>------------------<br>Whens the end coming?

            <div class='col-md body'>Bochup,<br>No you can say that. Moral selectivity prioritises the END or GOAL above all. Achieving this end or goal is its purpose. If you say someone whp practises moral selectivity has a moral hierarchy, then this end or goal may not be achieved if the hierarchy forbids certain acts or events necessary for this achievement. The whole point of moral selectivity is the ability to appropriate morals to dress up your actions AFTER you have achieved your end or goal.</div>

Well, I suppose my alias is Lang Zi (Wanderer)...<br><br>On your point about the majority's happiness being dangerous, I can quote you an example of such a case being dangerous. The Nazi Germany in the 1930s was a very good example, where the government took the whole country to war, because of rebuilding of their empire against Britain, France and US after the lost of  the empire in World War I.  However, one must understand that the country  matters of any government is dependent on what kind of interests which the politician holds. Singapore is a very good example, by adopting the economic policy, where people are being geared into materialism. The government purports a policy of good life comes with education. So,  our generation is built with this line "More Education means more success". Of course, you and I know that it is not true. But what it has managed to achieve, is that the country's economy is raised by the rise of education of the masses. Well, not that I am being cynical, but one must understand that we can never achieve 100% efficiency in whatever things we do, especially when it comes to administration. A very nice application of the 2nd law of thermodynamics indeed. So, such a way could be one of the plausible solutions to take. I would like to ask if we don't adopt an utilitarian approach, can there be any other better approaches in the governing of a state? Priortising sets aguideline in my opinion rather than having no structure at all.<br><br>I will deal with your later points after I finished listening to a debate tonight on "This House believes that the West cannot be the guardian of all world affairs..." Well,  it's been great to come back to this thread after writing too much fiction. I need some mental exercise to keep me going.</div>

Maybe a little readup would help you to understand our arguments and discussions. I found the memoirs of LKY very interesting and understood from his perspective on certain sensitive issues in politics which he had to deal with all time.<br><br>Anyway, I don't think I am that high level or on any higher ground compared to anyone in terms of my profession just that it is not popular in Singapore, and the States is where the action is. Just that, I think I should just venture into the States after I completed my doctorate. Perhaps, I might end up a banker in Wall Street, if I can't find a job related to my profession. So, don't worry, I am sure that I can discuss things simply. Most likely, I might not be able to meet anyone in Singapore since I still like to keep my identity a secret.
