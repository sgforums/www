If one intend to do in private sector the certificate may not make such a big difference but if you are toking abt gahmen jobs THEN the certificate is so much more valuable. As I said before, wanna work for and earn money from gahmen, you better have a very big piece of paper else you will lose out in terms of even securing a job interview!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
