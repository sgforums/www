            <div class='col-md body'>Hi All,<br><br>I believe most of us here are in our 20s and would have spend 3-4 years to get our first degree. While we are struggling here, coping with studies and the difficulties of being an adult-student (poor) , our peers who decided to start their career first would have gained a headstart.<br><br>I had friends who graduated with a diploma and went on to SIM for their degree. Most completed their degree on a part time basis in 2-3 years. I even had a friend who start his own biz and owns his first car in a few months. All these happened while I'm still pursuing my education here. I feel demoralised being left behind, not knowing if I'll ever catch up in the future.<br><br>All these led me to think if what we are doing is worth it. Spending this important period of our life studying, paying the tution fees, giving up opportunities to pursue a degree.<br><br>I think I'll, at the very best, secure a job with a 2.5K salary while my other peers would have gone much ahead. I can't help feeling demoralised.<br><br>Anyone also feels like that? Or can anyone help me feel better?<br><br></div>

It is so damn obvious if you work for gahmen sector. They all see cert. But if private companies will have to see what are their area of focus. Sometimes they only need poly graduate employees only.<br><br>So if wan to work for gahmen sector, best to get a degree cert in spore  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

While we are struggling here, coping with studies and the difficulties of being an adult-student (poor) , our peers who decided to start their career first would have gained a headstart.<br><br>I had friends who graduated with a diploma and went on to SIM for their degree. Most completed their degree on a part time basis in 2-3 years. I even had a friend who start his own biz and owns his first car in a few months. All these happened while I'm still pursuing my education here. I feel demoralised being left behind, not knowing if I'll ever catch up in the future.<br><br>All these led me to think if what we are doing is worth it. Spending this important period of our life studying, paying the tution fees, giving up opportunities to pursue a degree.<br><br>I think I'll, at the very best, secure a job with a 2.5K salary while my other peers would have gone much ahead. I can't help feeling demoralised.<br><br>Anyone also feels like that? Or can anyone help me feel better?<br><br></div></blockquote>Depends on the industry that you're in. I know of someone who has a Masters, starting pay was less than 2k. O.O</div>
