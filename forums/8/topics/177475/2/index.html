            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by BillGates:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi All,<br><br>I believe most of us here are in our 20s and would have spend 3-4 years to get our first degree. While we are struggling here, coping with studies and the difficulties of being an adult-student (poor) , our peers who decided to start their career first would have gained a headstart.<br><br>I had friends who graduated with a diploma and went on to SIM for their degree. Most completed their degree on a part time basis in 2-3 years. I even had a friend who start his own biz and owns his first car in a few months. All these happened while I'm still pursuing my education here. I feel demoralised being left behind, not knowing if I'll ever catch up in the future.<br><br>All these led me to think if what we are doing is worth it. Spending this important period of our life studying, paying the tution fees, giving up opportunities to pursue a degree.<br><br>I think I'll, at the very best, secure a job with a 2.5K salary while my other peers would have gone much ahead. I can't help feeling demoralised.<br><br>Anyone also feels like that? Or can anyone help me feel better?<br><br></div></blockquote>This is the game of life, it's really fun once you get the hang of it. Since you're already in the degree course, don't stop halfway, complete it that's the best you can do at the moment. I'm a diploma holder but I do get higher than degree pay because I worked really hard for it. I strongly believe that your attitude in life is the main criteria if you want to succeed in life, as well as the people you know. Diploma and degree or master degree means little when you get a job and slack all day long, in the end, the boss only cares what you can produce rather than what paper you're holding. Paper qualitifications will matter more when, assuming both workers are as hard working as each other, then the growth is restricted for diplomas, or lower educated people. You really should give your best shot in everything you do, rather than keep envying others. Jealousy will not do you any good. Diploma or degree, or whatever, I can assure you that if you have an A+ attitude in life, you should be able to conquer almost anything and have a fulfilling life. And a fulfilling life doesn't mean you have to be the richest man in the world, it's just that you have the money to get the things you want to keep you happy.</div>
