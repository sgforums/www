The strong current of water splashing on her window will cause the water to drip all into my house through my windows.<br><br>The next thing I want to complaint about her, is hanging out wet dripping clothes. Everytime she does washing, she doesn't drain them dry at all. She just hang out the clothes that drips water as if they have never be drain and twisted at all. She is being very inconsiderate as she is making all the clothes that all of us hangs below her wet.<br><br>Thanks</div>

OTherwise, the simple place to have a go-between is the CMC. they actually have a hotline. these people are meant to help mediate. Meanwhile, good luck if she's a pre-60er Singaporean!!</div>
