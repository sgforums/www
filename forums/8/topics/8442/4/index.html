            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Terence,<br><br>For the full story of how I expose Colette as Ingenue, refer to the singles thread. Well, as a matter of fact, it was Ocean who insisted that it was Colette, while I made some wrong turns here and there. So, it is unlikely that I assumed that Colette would think of such issues..... Well, besides, I treat Aunty Colette as an older sister. But to crack the case took me 1 week and 3 days (the intense days since my vacation started on last Saturday).<br><br>Well, it is a pity that we did not see Barclays the last time... Care to do any guessing again, Terence...<br><br>yours,<br>Prodigal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>colette:<br><br>Here babe, this should be your very first post in FON.<br><br><strong>From:ingÃ©nue Posted on 2000-07-23 23:59:00</strong><br><br>how do you define a nerdy looking guy? someone who has simple dress sense, wear glasses and look bookish? er, wouldn't that account for almost half of the Singapore male population? <span style="font-style: italic;">although i must say that some of these bookish looking guys are quite cute too.</span><br>------------------------------------------<br>Well, I definitely have no clue to who you are then, just a tint of familairity in the style of writing, comparing the majority of the a group to prove a point. *smiles* but I notice something that is the nature of wanting to say something flirtish but held back as I highlighted above.<br><br>so I decided to give it some thought as to who you are...<br><br><strong>From:ingÃ©nue Posted on 2000-07-24 07:18:00 </strong><br><br>of course there are cute looking nerds, the type that blushes prettily when a female compliments him, the type with good looking features and fanatical about his passions, that's one type of nerds i've had the good fortune to meet but i realise that to fall in fall with one is pure torture, afterall they're nerds and are almost <span style="font-style: italic;">blur like sotong</span> when it comes to affections of their <span style="font-style: italic;">friends</span>]<br>-------------------------------------------<br>You used the word friends rather than the norm like "the gals around them" or something. So why friends? I asked, most probably because the 2 of you had a liking for each other even though you 2 were good friends, but the guy just dun get the signals you were generating and left you waiting. Well, I hate to dig this up, but did you not mention about this guy friend of yours whom did not know how to initiate something before he left singapore for further studies? *smiles* Well, I went through a memory jog, and thought about the gals in the forums, and I could only think of you with such an experience.<br><br>And of course the use of verses like "blur like sotong" only help in making my judgement clearer. you might not have notice, but you have a penchant for using this pharse actually, especially to guys who dun know how to flirt back. *laffs*<br><br><strong>From:ingÃ©nue Posted on 2000-07-24 13:14:00 </strong><br><br>callan<br><br>double identity? <span style="font-style: italic;">who do i remind you of? </span>with regards to nerds, <span style="font-style: italic;">there's only one whom i truly want</span>, so thanks for trying to pick me up but i'll have to get to know you better first before deciding if i want another nerd, no offence.<br><br>I tried to confrim my guess by flirting with you, and honey pie, if you know me well enough, I dun just go and pick up gals in a forum, unless they initiate something with me, or I know them in private. *smiles* so I am not just picking up another gal. You asked me who I remind you of, but thats a very wrong move dearest, I was just waiting for that. Assuming that you are really a different person, you are not in FON for long, and you would have argue that you are not someone else, for the psychological thinking of a person is to put up a self defense structure to put down such false accusations especially to a new surrounding. But you did not, rather you asked me who you remind me of, the curiousity in you to probe as to whether I really know who you are surfaced, and that confrims a double identity, and someone I know. Also asking such a question only confrims that you are familiar with my surrounding for it would not be useful to ask something like that, unless you know the people around me.<br><br>As for the nerd you really want, I am just guessing that it is a clue you left behind subconciously. A flirting nature, the irresitable urge to flirt with this "nerd" whom I assumed to be pacman *giggles* still surfaced, you could be doing it deliberately to let me guess, but I do not know, so I deicided that regradless if it is intentional or not, it is still a clue to me and who else is chasing pacman round in the forums? Thought as much as I like to deny this fact, and imagine that nerd to be me, but reality hit me like a sledgehammer, and I can only end up with one possibility, my peppermint icing.*winks* Well, he might not be Pacman you are makign a reference to, but it is the closest I could get to, I am thinking that it could be the crush you are havign now, you know, the guy whom you went to his house and he is not in, but his parents around? *shurgs* but I figure that it complete the puzzel as well, though not as fitting as pacman.<br><br>As to why I did not reply your post after that, I am known to get my answers and leave them behind. When I probe, a large part of it is for fun, and once the challenge is over, I move on. And I know myself, if I were to continue replying with you, I would unveil you sonner or later, the policeman instinct still stays in me till now. And I have exposed Maya, which I dun want to do to you, dun wanna add my name to another person's hate list.<br><br>So dearie, on seeing how much I understand you, and how much I can gathered of you with just a few post, do you think I appreciate you enough? I think I do, and the attention I give you is so much more than any of your other flirtees, so why aren't you reponding enough to me yet? Or are you frighten by me? I would not blame you if the fact that I can read you so well scares you, it is afterall a skill which many people dread, for I might just know the way to thier hearts to well. Oh...and you have not tell me yet, if your heart is thumping with fear at that very moment your were reading my previous post, I think you better keep the answer to yourself, for I might just read you again....but I help you in the analysis...<br><br>If your heart is thumping, of course it meant that you are scared at how much I know about you, but it is not only that, it means that you like me, but dare not approach me for fear that I read you even more.<br><br>If it is not, it only shows how much you welcome me into your life, and the closer I get to you,the more comfortable and acceptable I become.<br><br>So which one do I belong to? *winks* either way, I know, and you know that I know, that somewhere, somehow, some place, we are meant to be bonded to each other in someway.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Callan (edited 01 August 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi Callan,<br><br>just a short post as i'm in a hurry to go somewhere. and no, my heart was not thumping with fear but i had a good time and laugh reading your reply, you're sharp, so i guess i'll have to be sharper still the next time around. btw, i've two other nicks in FON, care to guess them?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>ingÃ©nue was created on 23 July 2000 on the spur of the moment, around that time i posted that very first post, therefore, signs of colette is still there, the brain took a different track only a few hours later.<br><br>and no offence to pacman, although i do like him very much, the nerd i referred to in my post was not him, it was someone i know in real-life, someone i was silly enough to have a crush on, but that nerd is a lost cause and it's time i move on. sometimes i wonder if it's my fear of commitment that made me continue in wanting him, anyway, my galfriend seems to think so. i mean i know he doesn't like me that way but me liking him, yeah, that's so very safe and there's no real reason that my heart should really break, i mean i already know the score. now if he reciprocates, that would be like hitting the jackpot for me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">. well life goes on.<br><br>will have to get back to the post later if there's anything to add.<br><br>have fun!<br><br>and YOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO pacman,<br><br>and how are you today darling? i've missed you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"> er, did you miss me too? hahahahaha ...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, TinDonGal<br><br>We are so honored to grace your presence in this thread. Yeah, I think that it is much more in a foreign land when u meet a friend coming from another place, or someone whom u don't know before. It is really fun to have that kind of experience.....<br><br>It was just fun to talk about the things happening around us... Well, we are not only guys who just talk about subjects like fascism and sociology or even politics, we also talked about sexy subjects like which is the best perfume to use for a date, and what are the best pickup lines, and which club to go in UK.<br><br>Have a nice day and see you often...<br><br>yours<br>Prodigal</div>

Like when we punt down the river, we talked about the world, and when we are in the bar, (where the college babes come and pick him up), we talk about mundane things...
