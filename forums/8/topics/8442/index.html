            <div class='col-md body'>Well, 22 July (Saturday) 2000, while there is a big forumite gathering in Singapore which involved Revey, Qwerty, Maya, Sparkle, Tet, Eeriegal and many other forumites, there is another gathering happening across another continent, in a small island off the Straits of Britain, and in a small town, an hour east of London, the Prodigal has gotten himself a visitor from Coventry, and it is none other than his counterpart who would not waste any time and effort in engaging in arguments with him.. He is none other than Terence....<br><br>We met on the train station, and walked thru every part and bit of the town which I stayed, and I also punted Terence across the river of the town, discussing politics, sociology, history and many things which are happening around us, and most inevitably on some of the forumites we know dearly, ranging from Flirty Colette, Quiet Ray, Smiling Sparkle, Gorgeous Maya, Happy Naivegal, Philosophical Ray, Strange Tet, Cassanova Revey, Warring Hata-san, Controversial Rinoa, and many others whom I failed to mention.<br><br>Well, we had our guys nite, drinking by the river, with pints of stellar artois, followed by Kroeinburg, and then finally reached my home with another few rounds of whisky. While at my home, a long distance connection was made between Maya and Terence, while they began their rendezvous, while the prodigal took his rest after a tiring day of being the punter.. Finally, when Terence was done, Prodigal has made another long distance connection to another part of Asia, to Naivegal, where she heard the sexy voice of the mysterious Terence....<br><br>Well, the guys rested till morning, and then we headed to Starbucks cafe for another round of coffee (and it's cafe latte), looked at books and started getting ready for a list of books before we engaged in our next conversation. Finally, we had lunch in the largest pub in UK, and then with a long walk, discussing about fascism and has begun our long project on a novel which we planned to collabrate.. It was surely a meeting of two fascinating people, and we have enjoyed each other's company, and in the midst of the ladies company who were afar as well....<br><br>I am glad that I have met Terence, but we have decided that we would not have a picture together so that his identity remains mysterious..... Trust me, he is one of those guys, who angmoh gals in the bar would like to chat him up... His mind is of sharp intellect and it is seriously fun talking to him not only on issues of the world, but personal dreams and issues as well.....<br><br>We parted at 3.40 pm on 23 July 2000, and would soon be meeting again..... It was a pity that Barclays who is in London did not make it to join us....<br><br>Nevertheless, it has been a great time....     <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Reporting from UK,<br>Prodigal<br><br>------------------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights.

            <div class='col-md body'>irrelevant but this's indeed a new way of writing a date: 23 Saturday 2000 and it's barely 7 am in Singapore, 24 July 2000 now, so how could Terence have left at 3 pm? unless UK is a few hours ahead of Singapore, which i doubt so. when my friends were studying in UK a few years back, i remembered that they were a few hours behind us, oh well.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>[This message has been edited by ingÃ©nue (edited 24 July 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Terence,<br><br>It is fun to have you around, and it is perhaps one of the most intellectual stimulations I have over the past few weeks of solitude. It is a pity that my man-killer Russian sworn sister is not around (she is also married), otherwise you would saying damn again.<br><br>Of course, we will have another time to finish up the other bottle in my room again, perhaps, the new one which I am moving into, with the beautiful view of the river where my college is... Maybe we can discuss some Wittgenstein, Bordieu, Marx and postmodernist thinking and the project which we will be working on as well.... I enjoyed the long walk to the train station where we thrashed out the concept of fascism, and I would hope to bring u to Grantchester Orchard where we can have more interesting discussions under the blessings of the great minds which have started it..... Glad that u liked Wittgenstein's book and I am sure that you will enjoy "The Dispossessed" by Ursala Le Guin.<br><br>Dear Maya,<br><br>We both hope that you made it to the tuition, and someday there may exist a chance for all three of us to discuss interesting ideas and thoughts face to face.... I suppose I can bring u the baileys before your Terence dear would....<br><br>Dear Naivegal,<br><br>Hmmmmmm, unless u have telepathic powers since I was already into slumber while the rendezvous between Maya and Terence happened... Well, u could be Jean Grey in X-men.... Try reading my mind with your telepathic powers whether I have said anything bad about you. hahahahhahhahha<br><br>I hope that you all have a good time....<br><br>yours sincerely,<br>Prodigal<br><br>------------------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights.

            <div class='col-md body'>blimey, mates, i just got out of this mindnumbing soil consistency lecture and this is what i get to see?  woooohooo, see, i don't need to be poisoned to be...erm..entertaining.  By the way, do you have to hint to all and sundry that I use ICQ for cybering?  Now everyone is going to pester me for some.<br><br><strong>Prodigal</strong>:  I see your self esteem is in high tide as usual, "two fascinating people getting together?" hahahaha.  I would love to be there with you to throw daggers at terence because as surely as angmoh and non angmoh girls approach him in pubs, he will be all too willing to make them feel welcome (ahem).<br><br>I still want to know if he is hairy!<br><br>Anyway, thanks for remembering me and standing by the pewter to stop me from going for tuition.  i never did make it there because at the end of my um-chat with Ter it's already far too late.  Not that i regret it, I had a silly smile on my face the whole day remembering his antics.  yeah, and maybe we should continue the wolverine story, but i am not partial to lightning bolts, i prefer chopper-wielding men.<br><br><strong>Terence</strong> my baby!  I signed the bloody deal, I'll lose my signature rubbery (eeew) stamps if I don't stand by it!  So how do you like Proddy?  That man is so inhospitable to make you sleep in the sleeping bag, the least he could do was to offer the "you-sleep-above-i-sleep-above-the-cover" trick.  when you get here and you need accomodation, oh delicious bundles of muscles, call me.  if you really have to sleep in the bag again, i'll accompany you.<br><br>what do you mean not taking pictures to protect your secret ID?  I am not going to show it all to Tom Dick and Harry (maybe to Jean, Dana and Harriette...) Anyway, I think it's better still. Don't show it to me.  When we get to meet, you have to arrive first and sit in a cafe to wait for me (you know how I look like so you owe me one, sit still and quiet like a good boy).  I'll arrive there and try to spot you out of the other cafe dwellers.  (I'll pick the handsomest one so even though it's not you I don't lose anything)  :p<br><br><strong>Callan</strong><br><br>Don't believe anything you hear.  I do not engage in virtual sexual relationship with those two gentlemen. (I learned that one from Billy Goat Clinton)  You really should see X men, I came in as a sceptic and came out converted, wolverine is soooooooooooooooo broodingly intriguing.  Don't do anything to your date, I like her!<br><br>------------------<br>All suffering comes from a person's inability to sit still and be alone.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi Terence &amp; prodigal,<br><br>great to read that both of you had a good time. and er, proddy when you wake up Monday morning in a couple of hours in UK, could you kindly change the dates of your post? first line: 22 July 2000 and the date of Terence's departure: 23 July 2000? it's confusing the living daylights out of most of us in sunny S'pore as it's only 2.15 pm currently.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Callan,<br><br>Well, since Tet, Eeriegal and Naivegal (or Tindongal) could have their femme nite, we guys can have our Bachelor's nite as well. U can always start your guys nite out thingy. Of course, it was really enjoyable to drink by the side of the river, and then chat.....<br><br>Dear Colette,<br><br>Yes, I made the mistake with the date, since I have been living for weeks in isolation and solitude, I have lost track of space and time, even though I have been entrenched in deciphering the secrets of the Universe. It is a pity that u did not made the transmission to call both of us and hear the sexy voice of Terence....<br><br>Dear Maya,<br><br>I did offer to let our dear Terence to sleep on my bed while I take the floor with my sleeping bag. Well, our Terence is just the rugged man who would want to sleep on the floor and of course, the consequence is to get his body hurt. I supposed that he is now sleeping soundly back in his place.<br><br>I think that you have just made a few Freudian slips after reading Callan's messages (I doubt he meant virtual sex at all)... Well, your quote from Clinton would immediately snuff out a joke by David Letterman who made the saying,"Our president need to publish a new book, The Dummies Guide to lying in the White House."<br><br>*LOL* Well, by the way, Wolverine is a he and not a she.... I am an X-men fan but I am going to be disappointed by the potrayal of Magneto in the story, because he is a multi-dimensional character (since he changed from bad to good to bad to good and now I don't know what happened since I stopped reading) in the story and is my favourite character for his depth and character being nicknamed the Martin Luther King of Mutants, but would be turned into a one-dimensional villain by the screens of Hollywood. Rogue looks quite sexy in the story. Jean Grey is supposed to be more beautiful than Rogue in the story. Well, Prodigal still prefer his lightning bolts and disappearance act and multidimensional strings to deal with the Wolfy Maya! Hahahahhahahahahahahhaahhahahaha<br><br>Well, Hata-San,<br><br>I would prefer to go to the area in World Trade Centre, where the bridge linked from the main land to Sentosa island, or go to Marina Bay to look at ships when I feel a moment of solitude.. But I am having a lot of that these days...<br><br>In any case to all, I amended the date.<br><br>yours sincerely,<br>Prodigal<br><br>------------------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights. However, love is not about finding someone to relieve you, but love is about you devoting your heart and soul to love that someone, even if you know that someone do not love you the way you do."<br>- Prodigal</div>
