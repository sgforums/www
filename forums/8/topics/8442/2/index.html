            <div class='col-md body'>for : Prodigal<br><br>The Spider Who Wanted To Be a Fly<br><br>There was a naive spider who lived in her web somewhere on the lower branches of a pine tree in the cold countryside.  Everyday she sat on her gleaming silken web to admire the flies which moved around with a buzz and great dexterity.  She longed to fly like they did instead of just sitting around her old stationary web.  So she watched.  And waited.<br><br>One day a young fly in his hurry and recklessness was caught in her web.  The fly knew this could spell his death but being a young punk that he was he decided to die with a blast.  However the spider did not want to eat the fly.  She wanted to ask him to teach her how to fly.  She approached him while he shivered inwardly.  Her small head was hovering above his unmoveable body and he struggled to be free.  Strangely the spider merely used one of her legs to poke at the fly and released one of his wings.  He was amazed and he became still to see what the spider would do next.  She poked once again and the other wing was freed as well. Then she jumped up and down her web like it was a trampoline.  The fly thought she was insane but played along.  He pumped himself up and down while the spider attempted to smile at her newfound playmate.  The momentum of the fly carried him up and he was freed from the web.  He flew away without a good bye.<br><br>So she tried to befriend few more flies but it was always the same story.  She didn't realize that she couldn't be a fly simply because she was destined to eat flies and the flies knew it.  She did eat lesser flying insects like mosquitoes and the flies could smell the latter's blood in the web.  She didn't know.  Days went by and her wanting and disappointment turned her heart black.<br><br>A fly and his sweetheart were caught in the web one day.  Our black-hearted spider as usual came to see the newcomers but this time she rolled them into two cocoons of white waxy substance.  She poked her fangs and legs at both of them -not to eat them because she retained her old habit- to hurt and make them afraid.  The spider had seen how the two of them flew with cheerful buzz and somehow it didn't seem that this fly would leave his sweetheart, why had they left <span style="font-style: italic;">her</span> then?  When the female fly died, the spider released the male from his prison and tossed both of them out of her web into the emptiness outside.  His weakened wings could not flap anymore so he just drifted gently with the wind, slowly towards the ground.  The spider watched fascinated.<br><br>After a few more experiments she decided to move to a much higher position.  She traveled to the peak of the mountain and found the tallest pine tree there.  It stood precariously at the edge of a valley and the chilling mountain breeze drowned the peak with restlessness.  The spider who wanted to fly stood on a quivering leaf.  She lowered herself on a strand of strong silk and the wind swung her around, it almost felt like flying!  But it wasnt's enough.  Above the valley she cut her string.  The wind carried her light body but she invariably went downwards.   The valley was deep though and along her flight down she met some birds (which wanted to eat her but failed somehow) and some flying insects (she waved at them).  Once the breeze took her to the wall of the valley and she was suspended long enough to tell her story to a spider sitting on his web.  Then with a smile she drifted down again, probably to die at the end of her descent, probably not because of her light body and soft belly.  But she was happy then, she had flewn once.<br><br>------------------<br>All suffering comes from a person's inability to sit still and be alone.<br><br>[This message has been edited by MayaJade (edited 26 July 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear colette,<br><br>Was it just me or did I miss you for a few days in the forums? Did not see much of you, must be your devilish boss at work again. Somehow I have been thinking that you work in the creative line, design, printing, or advertising maybe? Well, I concluded that from the fact that you use the Mac so much more often then a PC, and the fact that you started using Mac in early 1990s, to my knowledge only people in the designing line or printing line uses them in SG then. I know for I am also one of them. *smiles* Anyway, do have good luck and keep your presence felt, I am missing it from you.<br><br>Maya:<br><br>So shall I follow prodigal and call you Mayarine from now on? *laffs* nah, somehow I vaguely recall you saying that you dun like a hairy mate, you like them clean and shaven. Hmmm...tell me if I am wrong. Anyway, I was at borders just now, browsing through some books and I came across a book call MAYA, for a moment I thought you finally published a autobiography of yourself, and quickly grab a copy, but to my dismay, I found it to be a guide book on the 3D animation effects program MAYA. I will try not to think so much of you now, it is having an unhealthy effect on my life. Think you better go ahead with your plan to find me a girlfriend soon, least I shower too much attention on you to make you run away again. *grins*<br><br>Prodigal:<br><br>I can confrim with you that Tet is not strange in anyway, trust me, she is only rare, not unique though, not as much as she claims to be. *tet, come and get me for that!* It would be hard to find a woman of her type in Singapore nowadays. I dun wanna tell you why, for I think you can only see it for yourself.<br><br>Terence:<br><br>Do you know how much Maya baby here is in love with you? I shall say she is obsessed. Many a times, I fought with you for her attention, but she still have only eyes on you. She never fail to at least mention your name once to me in our dates, but I guess, I have to put up with that, since I am at least still on a date with her. hahahaha....<br><br>An no no, dun you wanna take join in the competition for Naive too, prodigal is already too much for a imbecile like me to handle, and with you,sarcastic witty godlike hairy mortal, I am dead meat. Maybe we can discuss a deal or something at boat quay(is this place becoming so popular or what?) if you come back, yeah? Without Maya of course, she would be too much of a distraction. *grins*<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ingÃ©nue:<br><br>Hey, thanks for reading and commenting on the drama mama fable.  So you think that feeling discontent is a conscious act?  I do not agree fully to that, the feeling usually arises after much pondering on life.<br><br>I was told once that living without wanting anything is a budhist concept (true? not?).  Desire brings pain and we can avoid pain altogether if we do not want.  But isn't want important?  It is the light that acts as beacons for our journey.  It may lead us to swampy ground and we have to deal with the disappointment of failing to reach it but if there is no light, where are we going to go?  If we have no want, then what do we do now?  I lack the sophistication to picture a fulfilling life (or whatever good life is supposed to bring) without a drive and drive is synonymous with desire.  If life is about avoiding want, maybe a speedy death is best since dead people don't seem to want anything.<br><br>Finally, the quote below my message is from De Mello.  I do agree that desire brings suffering but it's the only way to live if we want to live at all.<br><br>Prodigal:<br><br>sigh, missed yesterday's appointment Mr. Therapist but I think I should not enroach on your quality time with your erm..nurses maybe?  The story looked damn good in my mood yesterday (tragic queen / drama momma  mood) but as usual self-destructive element makes normal people (like I am <span style="font-style: italic;">today</span>) feel sorry for the spider.<br><br>I don't dare to even try to upstage Harry Potter.  The thought that books that thick can still appeal to mainstream readers is just too overwhelming.  I haven't read it anyway, I am still at that Maxted book.  But we'll write a story when I see you, okay?  I suppose we can go to yet another riverside to have a drink and argue whether the male character should win again now that it is <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> you alone writing the story   :p<br><br>Callan:<br><br>It's hard to believe that though you're surrounded by these veritable beauties you still want me.  Is it because you can't rest until you have us all?  You should discuss the proportional relationship between the amount of desire and misery with Prodigal, bÃ©bÃ©.<br><br>I can't find anyone who's interested in the stockmarket or real estate, sufficiently playful and parties hard.  Perhaps it's because I am not interested in those things myself (aye caramba, I just want to see the end result, dough, dough dough   :p)  But if you ask me, Callan, why, stay single.  Single is good for the soul, I can argue it out when I see you again (though not this THURSDAY, babe, I'll be BUSY this Thursday).<br><br>------------------<br>All suffering comes from a person's inability to sit still and be alone.<br><br>[This message has been edited by MayaJade (edited 26 July 2000).]</div>
