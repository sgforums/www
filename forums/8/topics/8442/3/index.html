I'd rather have one dorky Terence than 500 suave hunks licking and sucking my toes every sunset.  If you are so willing to let me and Tet do as we please, you better prepare yourself for another thing coming because certainly bondage mistresses aren't going to do something you like.  Your humiliation is our fodder, your submission is our medal.  We're gonna push your limit so that you  will be screaming and hopefully see that we are not into kid's play.<br><br>Damon's number, quick!  I'll let you off with one less spanking if you give it to me quick.  Can I at least know his bro's name?<br><br>Finally, am i getting two therapists here?  I am obsessed with the idea of being obsessed?  Since I am such an open book maybe Callan should date you instead of me.<br><br>Smooches and rude snogs<br>obsessee<br>maya<br><br>proddy<br><br>i wanna do it when you see me face to face, writing it is a bit troublesome.  beside i wanna see how you look when you think.  i find smart men donning their thinking caps incredibly sexy.<br><br>--------------------------------------<br>If they can put one man on the moon, why can't they put them all?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>maya,<br><br>i donÂ’t think the feeling of discontent is a conscious one, most of the time, especially in the beginning, it would be an unconscious act until such a time when youÂ’re aware of it. now what you do when youÂ’re aware of your strange affliction would determine how happy and content you will be in future. and i disagree that the feeling of discontent usually arises after much pondering on issues of life, some people are just too acquisitive, theyÂ’re so busy acquiring things, people and material possessions that they donÂ’t even pause to wonder if theyÂ’re in fact necessary for their survival and/or happiness.<br><br>i have never understood the concept you mentioned about not wanting. how can one not want anything? the mere act of eating to keep alive is a wanting, itÂ’s a incomprehensive concept and totally unattainable, at least to me. one might as well just expire, why bother to suffer throughout oneÂ’s lifetime when death is the only certainty while having to suppress all wants and desires that would come as naturally as breathing?<br><br>when i wrote that if only the spider has been contented with just being a spider, i donÂ’t mean that it has to be a spider with no dreams. it can still dream, it could spin a more beautiful and intricate web, be a little more vicious in its killing, do anything within its scope to its best ability or even surpass it but it has to learn to be content. itÂ’s not a fly, so it can never Â“flyÂ” unaided and aspiring to be something that it was not is simply the height of foolishness for itÂ’ll bring misery upon itself as it contemplates on the Â“thingsÂ” it perceives itself to be missing out on when God has bestowed on it its own special talents and place in the big scheme of things.<br><br>thereÂ’s nothing wrong with desiring people or things but you have to be realistic in your quest, certain things or people are not meant to be yours, hankering after them will not make them yours, even if the people you deeply desired are by your side for they too may be discontent, searching for their own version of paradise. and so when their perceived paradise becomes available to them, they will leave and the hurt begins. but does that mean that you shouldnÂ’t have desires? no, desire all you want but be aware of the possible hurts and consequences of desiring beyond your abilities if God doesnÂ’t smile on you.<br><br>sometimes your desires and wants confuse you and blind you to the happiness that is yours for the taking or within your grasp and these same dark longings never go away when you allow them free rein or even a small foothold in your subconscious and you become bound in its web of deceit, cheating yourself of the happiness and love that could have been yours and yours alone. the grass is always greener on the other side but have you ever thought that whoever or whatever thatÂ’s standing on the other side probably thought about the same thing about your patch of grass?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>maya,<br><br>no problem. humiliation and pain in prescribed doses are good for the soul. spanking is very theraputic and sometimes going the extra mile is beneficial. how hard can you go? i've been a very bad boy.<br><br>i don't know damon's no. as yet i don't even know matt's home no. i'm sure women flock to him daily for his brother (whom i thought was married?) and it'll be strange if he chooses to give it to me over the rest of the blondes. i'll pass a good word on.<br><br>i think a childhood history of therapy gives me a small licence to talk about obsession. see lah, maybe we can exchange tips when i return. the couch has never been more empty.<br><br>ingenue,<br>i think a lot has to be said about unconscious discontent. one can whittle away worldly ideologies and values into nothingness - and to man's credit, i think he recognises that. this sense of nothingness, or what Freud calls 'the oceanic', has been the underlying malady of modern man. of course we can all aspire to greater things within our human abilities but its equally valid to question the notion of Aspiration and Ability. we often talk about them as if we know what they mean but do we? if aspiration is akin to dreaming then what does the nature of aspiration tell us about our inner morality and paradigm?<br><br>we all can be happy spiders spinning intricate webs but what if the Mind has been demarcated from Body? what if the spider peers over his Self and sees more to Life than web-spinning and fanciful killing - the limits of his Body? is aspiration then contained within bodily limits, or will it naturally surge to the Mind's heights? and then, given the great sorrowful disparity between Mind and Body, how then can discontent be avoided?<br><br>cheerio<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ingÃ©nue<br><br>I had misunderstood your previous post then.  If we had dreamed instead of things within our capabilities, there would have been no aeroplanes because, like spiders, we're not meant to fly.  I am not gonna argue about the importance of having aeroplanes but we do have them and isn't it wonderful that we've broken a limit for that?  How is the limit set then?  Aren't we just assuming that we cannot do something because noone has ever tried/succeeded or because it is against our laws of nature?  The laws are not that perfect because it was us who defined them.<br><br>Yes the spider might have missed the chance of being the best web designer above and she might have been a happy celebrated spider there.  However she was happy flying down, too, and the only downside to that, I think, is the chance that she'd die at the end of her descent.  Is death that bad afterall?  Heroes die everytime and their death is venerated.  Suicides die, too, and they have to be buried away from te holy grounds.  Was the spider simply suicidal/self-destructive or was she a heroine for her own dreams?<br><br>------------------<br>All suffering comes from a person's inability to sit still and be alone.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well ingÃ©nue,<br><br>I beg to differ. Not all people acquire because they want to. There exist people who can't obtain what they want to pursue, so they divert their attention to other things. It is just a matter of perspective. It is okay that people are not contented with what they have, but what they should learn is to cherish and appreciate what they have besides them.<br><br>It is possible for not wanting something. Why not, there are people who lived frugally in the past. Think of great thinkers or religious icons, some of them like the Buddha lived a frugal life against a life where they could be promised riches and resources. Wanting something is a desire. There are basic neccessities in life of course, we need to eat,drink and sleep. What I think Maya is talking about is a different level. The level of desire for certain things.<br><br>Then why should a spider be contented as a spider? We are allowed to pursue our own dreams and ambitions. The people who persevere and make it there, totally defines the social trend, and that is what we are about. We are individuals with abilities, and if we can stretch our limit towards or even beyond it, we can make a difference in our people's lives. Why should we adhere to supernatural beings to tell us how to live? Why can't we live a life being good without the fact that worrying what our afterlife is going to be? Would not it be hypocrisy to see people who go to church and tell me of God, because they are afraid of going to hell?<br><br>As I put it, I don't want to be an idealist, I would rather be a pragmatic idealist, who can make things happen not at a grandeur scale instead of wasting my life to ask myself why I have done nothing in the end.<br><br>yours sincerely,<br>Prodigal<br><br>------------------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights. However, love is not about finding someone to relieve you, but love is about you devoting your heart and soul to love that someone, even if you know that someone do not love you the way you do."<br>- Prodigal</div>

But how would you know?  Even Picasso had failures in his life, wouldn't you say he wanted the "impossible" when he failed thus?  It will be nice to be able to follow destiny, unfortunately destiny is not a passage written on our birth certificate.  Looking back in life might show us that we were heading for something all along but tell me would you know it when you're moving forward?<br><br>I said that the spider might die, she didn't try the descent right away but she tried it after looking at how gentle the fly descended.  I picked spider because it's light and I've tried to drop ants down from heights hundreds times their body length, you know what, they do not die.  Would a  spider survive the fall?  Her light weight might let terminal velocity takes care of herself.<br><br>And thus it was a risk to die, not a downright death that she took.  Ayrton Senna risked his life for racing and he did die, would I say he was misguided?  No, even though I think perhaps human being are not supposed to travel at speed higher than that of running.  As for dying the death of heroes, I do not think we owe anyone anything so much that we have to die defending them.  I know if I die while trying out bungee jumping not many would have something nice to say about it but it doesn't mean that they have the right to denounce me an egoist who wasted mylife for the questionable momentary pleasure of bungee jump.<br><br>------------------<br>My notion of a husband at forty is that a woman should be able to change him, like a bank note, for two twenties.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Terence,<br><br>Well, I am also figuring a plot for the story, and it seems that we might have to dig out FON later when the thread goes into the 2nd and 3rd and so forth pages. I was basically reading fiction for the past few days. I have the fun and enjoyment to read two good books over the week : David Brin's "Foundation's Truimph" that explains two masters, a human and a robot manipulating the  final destiny of Mankind in the place of the cosmos which gave some thoughts about the project we have; and Nick Hornby's "High Fidelity", where the book seemed to coincide with the movie quite well, except one or two changes.<br><br>I think that the desire to go beyond the limit is how Mankind can go. I don't see the spider being ingenue (i.e. naive) in any sense to try to fly. Humans always start with a desire to change things, and subsequently change and then they realized problems. Well, if we turn inwards and stop expanding, then what happens is that the race would eventually die out because of natural selection. Evolution is a necessity to Mankind's eventual salvation. If we don't be the spider who wants to fly, then we would not have the Wright brothers inventing the first aircraft, that allow us to fly between continents.<br><br>yours,<br>Prodigal<br><br>------------------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear MayaJade,<br><br>This came to me as a thought this morning, when I woke up this morning after a heavy night of alcohol  and punting down the river in the night.<br><br>Being an intellectual is not something good, for some unknown reasons. As I begin to read, write and think more particularly on philosophy, I realize that I get depressed easily. Terence and I discussed about this, and we both agreed people who read philosophy gets depressed easily.  It is like being intelligent is not a gift, a handicap which spur the thinker to challenge difficult questions and confront abstract concepts that it makes him run in circles. Running in circles is something which I felt was a problem. The more I think about it, I suddenly realize that ignorance is bliss. But then, I am just not the kind who can "sit still".<br><br>yours sincerely,<br>Prodigal<br><br>------------------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights.

            <div class='col-md body'>prodigal,<br><br>of course not all people acquire things or people, i did say some people. i think most people if not all will feel discontent at one point or other of their lives, itÂ’s only natural, this restlessness of the heart is what propels human to seek better pastures. however, i feel that too much discontent is harmful and thatÂ’s why i wrote that it would have been better for the spider to have been content. when youÂ’re contented, youÂ’ll be at peace and happiness sort of just comes to you. isnÂ’t is better than hankering for some impossible things and feeling dissatisfied?<br><br>itÂ’s difficult to learn to cherish and appreciate things or people when you have them if youÂ’re discontented, because your heart is unsettled and restless, it tells you that there may be better things or people out there and thus it sends a message to you to seek further and further and because discontent is seldom satisfied, you may end up your whole life seeking for that elusive Â“something or someoneÂ” and sometimes along the way, you may even forget what you were seeking for in the first place. all that endless searching without even knowing why ...<br><br>well, perhaps it is possible for some not to want something but i think itÂ’s highly improbable, because as long as you possess a thinking brain, youÂ’ll want one thing or the other. the great thinkers, would they have not wanted world peace or whatever that was their passions were about?<br><br>i have no idea what a spider is supposed to want, what i meant is that as a spider, it has its niche and being contented doing what spiders do naturally and excelling in, it would have been good enough, why should it even think of wanting to be a fly or to fly for that matter?<br><br>as humans, we tend to pursue our own dreams and ambitions because having dreams is what keeps one alive and provide some purpose to oneÂ’s lives but one has to have the sound judgment to know what is good for oneself and what appears to be apparently good for oneself, the failure to distinguish between the two, usually brings untold grief to the recipient, thatÂ’s why i think it not such a bad deal to learn to be content. itÂ’s important for one to know oneÂ’s strengths and weakness and learn to work within its limits, some people are indeed blessed enough to know themselves very well while others are forever condemned to a life of restless and futile searching because they donÂ’t know themselves well enough or they do know themselves well enough but are discontented.<br><br>with regards to your point about supernatural beings, i donÂ’t think i mentioned anything about it. i merely mentioned God and i donÂ’t wish to get into a discussion about Him as yet because itÂ’s a never ending story there [in fact, this current topic weÂ’re doing is also a never ending one unless one of us tires of it soon] and a belief in God is a personal one, either you do or you donÂ’t, i would be hard pressed to get you to believe in Him if you already donÂ’t.<br><br>regarding the afterlife, well, some people likes to plan ahead  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">, i donÂ’t and i donÂ’t really care about it either. i would be lying if i say i donÂ’t mind going to hell, dÂ’oh i mind that a lot, but iÂ’m not a Christian because itÂ’s a passport to heaven, iÂ’m a Christian [not a very good one though] because i believe in Him and He takes care of me, well enough. iÂ’m a pragmatist, the afterlife is something iÂ’ve no control of in the sense that i donÂ’t get the choice of deciding i donÂ’t want to go to hell or not, so i tend not to worry about it too much, i hope to live my life as God directs me and hopefully all the choices i make in life are morally correct, but then that would bring us to the discussion of morality ... ... which is another headache.

            <div class='col-md body'>ingÃ©nue,<br><br>For some unknown reasons, I feel that you sound like someone I know. Nevertheless, that is not the point what the whole discussion. Though I detected the tones of an old friend, but nevertheless, I would just carry on this discussion.<br><br>I said it clear, there is a distinction between discontention and idealism. Let me made it clear to you, discontention arises from personal desires, and every action would mount to personal gain, for example, a person earns money because he wants to get rich by hook or by crook, he would still want more, because he thinks he has lesser money. Idealism is slightly different, it need not necessarily arise from discontention, but to change the environment, for example, Ghandi, who fought for the independence of India. U see, the desire is the issue here.<br><br>Not everyone have the choice to do what they want. We do what we must. Sometimes we can choose the path we follow. Sometimes our choices are made for us. And sometimes we have no choice at all. I refer to the choice, as the environment we lived in. Tell me that if I am born a black South African 50 years ago, I would fight for the freedom of my race from British Colonists. So, I don't see the point, why the spider should not want to be the fly, if being a spider is so difficult. The spider might as well go and die, if it cannot achieve what it wants to do. There is nothing wrong, because it is relative and based on a matter of perspectives.<br><br>I can skip the issue of God, as long it is not invoked in your statements to justify any form of argument. I subscribe to the notion that it may not be what I think, but that does not make it wrong.<br><br>Well, I never presume that you are telling me how to live. I lived by my own principles and my own standards, which I find that I don't belong to this era, because more and more people are disappointing me in the way they handle issues. Nevertheless, I would say that I would be contented if something ever happened in my life. I know what I want, but it does not mean that I can get what I want.<br><br>Have a beautiful Sunday as well.<br><br>yours,<br>Prodigal<br><br>------------------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights.
