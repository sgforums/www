Maybe some clinics or hospitals can recommend you a good phycharist, u can start from there.<br><br>Then again I hope u can tok 2 to her or somebody very close to her find out more. It is highly possible that a person be very stressful and not realising it, become of his/her mind "get used" to it. Until one day cannot take it and "snap", I heard of this kind of situation so call mental break down.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">Merry Meet Wannaknow,<br><br>Well have you tried Aromatherapy? It might help abit but temporary. Lavender with Geranium will work.<br><br>Do not turn to alcohol which may lead to some complicatrions later on. In the past i do have clients that got sleeping problem &amp; they resort to Alcohol to a point that its becomes more of a habit but an addiction. Without any Alcohol they can't sleep too, in the end it will not only be a sleeping problem but also Alcoholism. Sleeping problem that the doctor can't rectify, can be solved with Energy Healing Lightworks, Spells &amp; some herbal remedies with effective results.<br><br>Alternative you can book an appointment with me for Energy Healing. Sometime sleeping problems occur due to some imbalance in One's personal energy which later on manifest into a Physical Problem. I do have Spellkit available too for sleeping problems. In each SpellKit, there are items complete with instructions to create positive energy and focus around a desire however you got to cast the spell yourself.<br><br>Hope all these are of help to you. If you are interested, do PM me, for immediate action kindly leave me your name &amp; contact so that my guys can get back to you as soon as possible.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>
