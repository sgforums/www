This time round, find out the truth before jumping into conclusion. U don't just dump someone base on hearsay. Whether he did or did not(whatever that is), u're not sure !<br><br>And try, if u can, don't use anybody just for rebound. He will be hurt as much as u do.<br><br>From your words, i assumed that u still want your ex back. No point staying on with the one u don't really want. Stop using him &amp; try to make CHANCES for your ex to come back to u. But at the same time, give him time, don't corner him. Time will tell whether he wants u back. In the meantime, go out with other friends( i mean just fds, not BF) &amp; get on with your life.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personal opinion. I think its one thing to follow your heart and do what you really want. Whether thats the best thing to do for that situation is debatable, because afterall what you are talking about is more likely what you want rather than what you need.<br><br>Still, when we are talking about relationships, who has time to think about these things logically?<br><br>So, in short, I don't have suggestions. But if you want my opinion, I think you shouldn't hurt anyone just to make yourself feel better. e.g. use someone as a "spare." Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to say what you did was right or wrong, just that it seems that in any situation there are 2 parties, so what you think or feel is just one part of the situation. The final outcome will depend on you as well as how the other person reacts, and you can't always get what you want.<br><br>What the hell... not even sure what I'm talking about anymore. But I hope things turn out fine.</div>
