              <p> </p>
              <p>The Four Levels of Wealth</p>
              <p>There are basically four levels of wealth you must aim to attain.<br> <br>Level 1: Financial Stability<br> <br>The first level of wealth is known as financial stability. This is<br>the most basic level of wealth that you must first attain.<br> <br>You have achieved Financial Stability when:<br> <br>1. You have accumulated enough liquid assets to cover your current<br>expenses for a minimum of six months.<br> <br>2. In addition, you have life and hospitalization insurance to<br>protect you and/or your family's lifestyle should you be<br>permanently disabled, unable to work or if you pass away suddenly.<br> <br>When you have attained this first level, you will have the peace of<br>mind that should any unexpected challenges befall you (like<br>retrenchment, business failure, pay cut, death or disability), you<br>and your family's lifestyle will not be compromised. Or worse, you<br>or your family will not slide into debt.<br> <br>Once you have achieved this, you must then aim to achieve...<br> <br>Level 2: Financial Security<br> <br>You have achieved Financial Security when you have through the<br>investment of time, money and ideas, accumulated a critical amount<br>of Positive Cash Flow Assets that generate enough passive income to<br>cover your MOST BASIC expenses. <br> <br>In other words, when you reach this level, you can stop working and<br>maintain a very basic lifestyle. It also means that if you continue<br>working, all your active income can be channeled towards your<br>investments and this will further compound your assets and increase<br>your in-come streams.<br> <br>Of course, we shouldn't be satisfied at being at this level. Once<br>accomplished, you must then aim to go for...<br> <br>Level 3: Financial Fre-edom<br> <br>Many of us have heard of the dream of achieving financial fre-edom<br>but what does it really mean? <br> <br>Well, Financial Fre-edom is when you have through the investment of<br>time, money and ideas, accumulated a critical amount of Positive<br>Cash Flow Assets that generate enough passive income to sustain<br>your CURRENT LIFESTYLE.<br> <br>When you reach this level of Financial Fre-edom, you can choose to<br>stop working and still maintain your current standard of living...<br>indefinitely! <br> <br>In reality, most people who achieve financial fre-edom love their<br>work so much that they continue working not because they have to,<br>but because they choose to. <br> <br>I can tell you from personal experience that it is a great feeling<br>to have...being free of financial pressure &amp; worries and working<br>purely out of passion!<br> <br>Obviously, the more expenses you have now, the more luxurious and<br>indulgent your standard of living, the longer it will take for you<br>to achieve financial fre-edom. <br> <br>So besides increasing your passive in-come, reducing your<br>unnecessary/frivolous expenses will accelerate your way towards<br>this fourth level. Finally, you must aim to achieve...<br> <br>Level 4: Financial Abundance<br> <br>So what is the ultimate level of wealth you can achieve? Financial<br>Abundance is when you have through the investment of time, money<br>and ideas, accumulated a critical amount of Positive Cash Flow<br>Assets that generate enough passive income to sustain your DESIRED<br>LIFESTYLE.<br> <br>Your desired lifestyle is the amount of monthly expenses it will<br>take for you to live the life of your dreams. This is totally<br>subjective depending on the lifestyle that you desire. <br> <br>If your desired lifestyle is to live in a 20,000 square-feet<br>bungalow with a swimming pool, send your kids to the best schools<br>and drive a Mercedes Benz S-Class, then you could be looking at a<br>monthly lifestyle that'll cost a cool $50,000. <br> <br>Of course the more luxurious your desired lifestyle, the longer it<br>will take for you to achieve financial abundance.<br> <br>The moment you reach the level of Financial Abundance, you will be<br>able to choose to stop working and live your dream lifestyle<br>indefinitely. <br> <br>Again, most people who do reach this level usually love what they<br>do so much that they keep on working for fun, channeling 100% of<br>their active income towards charitable causes and further<br>compounding their wealth. <br> <br>With the right strategies and plans in place, you too will be able<br>to achieve this ultimate level of wealth.</p>

              <p>If you understood, you will not be donating much to them at all. Consider your current situation as investing in your own mind, in your own brain. The highest returns always come from investing in yourself. You have to see yourself as your greatest investment.</p>
              <p>Education is investing in yourself.<br>Army can be said as "donating" to the government, but view it in another way, you can also say that you learned lots of things that you would otherwise not have learned (unless you go become clerk or storeman la).</p>
              <p>For everything in life, there's a positive and negative view. Take the negative view, and you will be sad frequently. Take the positive view, and use it to further push yourself ahead of others, and you will be happier. Why not the latter?</p>

              <p>Positive thinking doesn't mean you should be contented with less. Most cash flow assets that generate passive income are generally not taxable.</p>
              <p>Positive thinking (in investing in yourself) also means that if you wish, you will find it easier to move away from Singapore if you are so unhappy with the million dollar salaries.</p>
