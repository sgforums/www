            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by hisoka:</div><div class="quote_body">no lah the worse maths is found in maths <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>electrical alot of prgraming.<br><br>oh yeah and NUS sucks, don't go there unless you are good if not become the stepping stones for the chinamen, indians, etc</div></blockquote>Well... you can always find out whether electrical is fit for you when you take level 1 programming during the first year in common engin. You can also try taking chemistry modules in the first year. If you end up liking chemistry more than programming, you can choose chem engin, environmetal engin or bioengin in your 2nd year. Hehe. (I know nuts about electrical, but you can ask me stuffs regarding chemical...)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Actually NUS is smart. They spent a lot on publicity and marketing to lure the PRCs, Indians and other foreign talents into NUS. They also spent a lot to improve their own image and to build ties with people from all around the world. That's why NUS has such a high ranking in the world's top universities... But frankly speaking, the top university ranking is just a part of the outer package. What really matters is the inner content. There are many universities which have a lower ranking than NUS and yet they are better than NUS in terms of the teaching system. (I know that because I went to Europe for immersion and Canada for internship.)<br><br>Comparing NUS with other universities, NUS is something like a "spoon-feeding" university. For some of my labs, everything is prepared for you before the experiment, and people will clean up for you after the experiment. In the end you only learn how to run the experiment without knowing how to prepare beforehand and clean up afterwards.<br><br>NUS is also more "theory-based" than "application-based". When I did an undergrad research project under a German prof during my 2nd year, he said I lacked the practical laboratory skills of a typical 2nd year German undergrad. That is a sad truth. A 2nd year chemistry module in NUS teach you all the reactions on paper, and you only synthesize 3 compounds in the lab sessions. On the other hand, a 2nd year chemistry module in Germany focus less on theories but more on lab, where students synthesize more than 100 compounds! If a NUS graduate and a German graduate apply for the same job, the German will have an advantage because he has more practical skills than you. (Theories can be learnt by reading books, but practical skills must be picked up by yourself in the lab.)<br><br>Hence, if you enter NUS, I strongly advise you to spend 1 or 2 semesters to go for SEP (Student Exchange Program), NOC (NUS Overseas College) or an overseas internship. Staying in NUS for the entire 3 or 4 years is inadequate. You must have some overseas exposure in order to become more independent and knowledgable than the rest.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Artiwizoras:</div><div class="quote_body">Btw, walesa, what do they teach in electrical engineering? I heard the worst maths can be found there.<br><br>Thanks a million!</div></blockquote>Actually, there's no direct answer to your question because it depends on many factors. For one, you have to realise not everyone holding an EE degree actually specialises in the same thing - some will choose to specialise in things like semiconductors/fabrication processes, while others might specialise in signals and communication systems. Hence, the maths required for your area of specialisation could be quite different. However, I believe, by and large, most engineering courses will still require an extensive knowledge of maths and the maths topics covered at the basic level(your foundation years prior to your specialisation) are pretty similar across the board.<br><br>To my knowledge, I know advanced topics(by that, I mean most things you probably wouldn't have covered by your A levels) like linear algebra, laplace transforms, fourier series and transforms are integral aspects of EE course (basically, it's highly unlikely, if not completely impossible, that any college would conduct an EE course without teaching these topics). That aside, some rudimentary programming involving OOP(probably C++ or java) and assembly languages will also be a key component of your education. I suppose you could go read up the abovementioned maths and programming topics to see if they're your cup of tea...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Having said that, I think the difference really comes from what you do later on. For the American system, if you do not take a proactive approach do your learning and expect to be spoon-fed or just learn the minimal scope(ie.only what's directly taught), you might still get by to complete your degree, but chances are you'd struggle when you start working as an engineer. Hence, if you're the sort who needs extensive spoon-feeding or people telling you what to do(ie.no initiative to learn beyond what is taught on your part), the British system might be better in the sense that the scope of what is taught is considerably more than the American system.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Hope that helps.</div>
