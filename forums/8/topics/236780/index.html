The student is made to take up soooooo many modules (imo to make the uni look good) but tbh the end product isn't very good.  I do not know why actually. Logically, heavier workload should result in students with greater knowledge and better graduates. But that is certainly not the case in NUS.</div>

I am currently taking H3 Physics at NUS and often see stars. LOL. Moreover, I heard engineering is much duller than sciences and again I ponder. Haha.<br><br>Thanks for giving any advice!</div></blockquote>What subjects did you take in JC?<br><br>If you have no idea what type of engineering to study in NUS, you can take a first-year common engineering programme and decide on the specific programme in your second year (except for Engineering Science which has a different programme structure and curriculum).<br><br>Many people think that engin is duller than science, because of the horrible workload in engin. That is inevitable, since the engin faculty forces students to take many compulsory modules (such as critical writing, engin professionalism, human resource, etc) which are not required for science students. The engin curriculum is also more rigid and more heavy than the science curriculum. (On average, engin students have to take 6 modules per semester while science students can take 5 modules only.) For many guys, engin is duller than science because the ratio of girls to guys is low in engin but high in science!<br><br>Although the engin curriculum is very "siong" (and dull), the career prospects and salaries for engin graduates are on average better than science graduates. After all, engin students are forced to take many rojak modules and hence they have the skills to enter careers in engineering, research, finance, management, etc etc.<br><br>But if you cannot tolerate the heavy workload &amp; stressful environment in engin, you can always come to science, where people are fun-loving and the atmosphere is relaxing. Science does not require you to take those compulsory modules required by engin, and that is both a blessing and curse. (Blessing, because you have a lighter workload. Curse, because you have less social skills than engineers and you are at a disadvantage when competing for jobs.) Hence, if you choose science, you should consider taking a minor, or doing an undergraduate research project, or go for NUS Overseas College, or get yourself involved in some prestigious activities, so that you can broaden your skills and make yourself more marketable when you graduate.<br><br>Also, a career in science requires a lot of passion and motivation. Some of my friends chose to study life sciences 3 years ago because of the government's plan to make Singapore into a biomedical hub. But after 3 years, my friends no longer have the passion for life sciences. Somemore right now the job market for life sciences is saturated. My friends have no choice but to take jobs with lower pay and not related to life sciences... and they kinda regretted. Hence, the moral of the story is, don't follow what the government says. Just follow your passion and choose the course that you like.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you want to go overseas but you don't have enough money, you can always study in NUS and apply for SEP (Student Exchange Program). You can spend one to two semesters in an overseas university, and you'll be paying the NUS tuition fee... Better still, you can find a SEP scholarship to sponsor (partially or fully) your expenses in the partner university.<br><br>Alternatively, if you're in engin or applied science, you can apply for an overseas internship. You can work overseas for one semester and get monthly allowance during your stay.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Artiwizoras:</div><div class="quote_body">Hey Everyone,<br><br>I am honestly a noob/rookie/nub/kid/boy/ignorant beansprout, on the issue of overseas university and local university.<br><br>NUS is ranked 17th, on overall performance, I heard. Hopefully I am not outdated yet. However, my main concern is that local education system teaches from the basics, ie british system whereas overseas university, such as those in US, imparts to you the more crucial skills of today,ie cutting edge technology, rather than focus on the outdated. Its the issue of Fundamental VS Current.<br><br>I know that a university degree does not gurantee success but you can say I am more or less the traditional hey-university-degree-secures-a-job better type of guy.<br><br>I feel like taking Electrical and Computer Engineering and at the same time, lack computing skills. I am currently taking H3 Physics at NUS and often see stars. LOL. Moreover, I heard engineering is much duller than sciences and again I ponder. Haha.<br><br>Thanks for giving any advice!</div></blockquote>As an electrical engineer myself (and I attended one of the better engineering schools in the US), I wouldn't advise you pursuing this course if you haven't the slightest interest in the content and are simply in it for the enticing remunerations this profession seems to promise.<br><br>That said, like what most others have said, you can't deny the fact that engineers in general do have more career options than many of their peers (compared with those who major in an arts or science discipline, for instance) as they could always choose to pursue a career in a non-technical field with the option of falling back on their engineering degree to take up a position that requires engineering knowledge. However, I still wouldn't recommend pursuing a course in EE for the sake of that if you do not have the interest in this field - the 3-4 years you're going to struggle with simply does not compensate for whatever career prospects you may seem to have IMO.<br><br>As for the US education system for a technical field, I'd say the American system is one that encourages independent learning more than the traditional British system. Basically, the course materials covered are not as intensive (at least, from my experience when I compare my course materials with my friends') content-wise as say that of some local universities, but they certainly aren't in the business of spoon-feeding. Hence, if you're used to being over-reliant on a rote-learning style of education, you could be lost in an American college system. There's no direct comparison between the 2 education systems IMO; it's more a case of which one suits you better methinks.<br><br>In spite of all that I've said, do not let me put you off pursuing a career in EE if that's what you really want to do.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> I certainly haven't regretted pursuing that course of study myself. Feel free to PM me should you need any further clarification or advice(just don't ask me for opinions comparing engineering with science because I can't do any comparisons without having studied science at the tertiary level)...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
