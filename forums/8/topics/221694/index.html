            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong><span style="color: red;">National Library is inflexible. It sticks to policy without thinking</span></strong></span><br><span style="color: indigo;"><br>A few years after the heated discussion on the infamous 'No U-Turn Syndrome' , I realise that the Singaporean "U-Turn" mentality is still very much alive and kicking.<br>'No U-Turn Syndrome' was coined by entrepreneur Sim Wong Hoo to describe the behaviour of Singaporeans who have a mindset of compliance to the higher authorities before they proceed with any action.<br><br>The analogy was used to explain the red tape he encountered with bureaucrats who stifled the creativity the government wanted to promote.<br><br>My recent encounter with the National Library confirms this.<br><br>During this school holiday period, the National Library had lined up various programmes and activities for young children.<br><br>In mid-October, I called to register my two children for an event at Bukit Panjang Community Library on 21 November.<br><br>The session was free but registration was needed as it was limited to 30 children. When I called to register, only one vacancy was available and I was told that there was no waiting list.<br><br>I registered one of my children. I was only required to give the child's name and age.<br><br>On the day of the event, a check with the National Library showed that none of those who had registered withdrew from the list. But we went there early hoping to get a place for my other child in case there was a no-show.<br><br>However, we were told by the librarian that the library's policy didn't allow this.<br><br>Still, we waited at the entrance and 15 minutes after the one-hour programme started, some children who had registered were still not there.<br><br>Meanwhile, one child was pulled out by his mother because he was too young for the activity. Another parent was also there with her son waiting for a chance to get in too.<br><br>Both of us were told by the librarian that if the children's names were not on the registration list, they would not be allowed in even though the class was well short of 30 participants.<br><br>This was in accordance with their policy, she explained. She also stated that the registered late-comers could turn up.<br><br>I do not blame the librarian. This was a safer way for her to go rather than taking the initiative to follow her common sense.<br><br>I tried to put my point across to her. Registration was free and it costs nothing for a kiasu parent to register a child and then not show up.<br><br>The most upsetting thing was that the National Library chose to cater to the registered late-comers and no-shows rather than those who sincerely wanted to participate in the event.<br><br>Why was there no waiting list? And even without a waiting list, the National Library should allow those who were not registered to queue up first. After a grace period, the vacancies could be filled on a first-come-first-served basis. This is fair as long as the condition is made known to those who register.<br><br>Unless a fee is charged on registration, as for some library activities, there will be kiasu people who would register and then not show up. By doing this, they deprive others of a chance to attend the event.<br><br>I hope the National Library will revise its policy and make the fun activities it organises accessible to those who want to enjoy them.<br><br>Low Mei Mei (Mdm) </span><br><br>This is classic singaporean.<br><br>'Please follow the rules'. Then when someone asks why we must follow the rules, the response is as follows: 'don't ask so much, just follow'.<br><br>That's about as no-brainer as the computer game lemmings.<br><br>I find the fear of retribution to those who seize the initiative a daunting prospect in any origanisation in SG. Clearly, despite the out-of-the-box encouragement by our govt, we are simply supressed by the obvious desire to 'lick the bosses' boots' and stay out of 'trouble' by following the rules <span style="color: red;"><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">to the letter</span></strong></span>.<br><br>Our Society is taught not to question the hand that guides you, only to remain compliant and OBEY.<br><br>How will we ever promote creativity if there are controls that stifle them?<br><br></div>
