Maybe next time you can just ignore my post?! But I do appreciate you coming in my thread and telling me all these meaningful advice.  I will keep it in mind...=D<br><br>I am mean, I am bitchy, I am nothing but an evil soul...God please help me!<br><br>It's just too bad that you don't respect me, and it's really too bad that I really do respect you for trying to tame me and enlightening me.<br><br>As for those that I gossip about.   I am truely sowwie that you actually did something bad and gave me the chance to gossip about you.<br><br>So, since you have a heart of gold, why don't you try to tame those that I was gossiping about.  Yes, if they didn't do anything notti in the first place, I won't have anything to gossip about. Or better yet, when they do something bad, maybe they should be smart enough to hide it and not make it so obvious.<br><br>And, last but not least.  I suppose you like entertainment yourself? Am I wrong? If not you won't be asking about the disappearance of Ngkaihoe in the thread he dedicated to me.  And I do believe that your posts are very constructive itselves...<br><br>My tongue?! OH GOSH!!! What am i going to do without my dear tongue?!  It means no more making out with my boyfriend!!!
