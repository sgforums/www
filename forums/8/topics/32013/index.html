So I found this article quite interesting.<br><br>Scrap taxi surcharge<br>A PLAN by taxi operator Comfort to experiment with a graduated midnight surcharge, in place of the 50 per cent hit at the stroke of 12, is nibbling at the edges of a problem. The idea should be abandoned. It would not put more taxis on the road from 10.30-11 pm onwards. It can only worsen the fare gibberish even Singaporeans find incomprehensible. Far worse is that cabbies would be abetted in committing a grievous form of service denial. With a fleet of some 10,000 taxis, Comfort has access to ample street data from its drivers and, through them, the opinions of commuters. If Comfort and the other two operators, CityCab and Tibs Taxis, have been giving serious thought to the feedback, they might acknowledge that the plethora of extra charges - of which the infamous midnight to 6 am charge is the most egregious - lies at the root of the perennial taxi problem. The objection is not to surcharge being a gouge, as flag-down fares are low, but how the extras have bred in too many cabbies all manner of misconduct and contempt for commuters.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Festival-period complaints about unreliable service are a ritual. The shortcoming is serious enough. But indifferent or plain bad service on a daily basis - during rush hour, towards midnight and whenever it rains - is inexcusable. The public should not have to tolerate it. Letters this newspaper has received show a consistency on this score through the years, long before the 1998 fare deregulation. Taxi companies have to face squarely the truth that a transport service that is good only in patches does not qualify as dependable. The Transport Ministry should be prepared to exercise tighter oversight if it is satisfied the deregulation has not brought improvements through competition.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is time operators got bold and radical: scrap all forms of surcharge (midnight, peak-hour, public holidays, CBD, weekends, whatever) bar one. The exception is the airport surcharge, to compensate for waiting time and the one-way empty trip. To make up for the surcharge loss, raise the flag-down rate markedly from the present range of $2.10 to $2.40. Tibs Taxis has got it about right. It does not impose a peak-hour charge but its flag-down goes up to $3.10 during that period (from $2.10). It avoids the midnight charge but drops the flag at $3.20. Tibs drivers say confused commuters think they are being overcharged compared with the $2.40 starting rate of Comfort and CityCab. Tibs should persist until the public gets accustomed to them. Booking fees must also come down to a nominal amount of, say, $1. Generous fees have encouraged the more grasping cabbies to drive on empty in hopes of bookings.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>In the end, it will be shown that higher starting fares with perhaps an appropriate mileage increase, but minus surcharge, will satisfy both parties. Cabbies will have no incentive to 'tailor' their runs, riders get a cab when they need one. Exactly what the flag-down rate ought to be should take into account reasonable earnings for drivers with extras axed. Low starting fares have made taxi rides a 'supermarket' service in Singapore. What the city needs is a 'boutique' service. The Government need not worry about a consumer revolt. The opening of the North-East MRT Line in April will bring cheap, on-time mobility to an additional quarter of the island. Bus coverage is comprehensive. Those easy riders who hop into a cab because fares are cheap will be forced onto the trains and buses. There might be fewer cabs plying. But with higher average earnings per cabby, reliable service and reduced congestion, who need grumble?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>parka copy from where one?<br><br>i dun agree wif scrapping the midnite charge, at nite taxis really tan bo jiak one if there's no midnite charge, there's so little ppl to fetch and yet so much competition from each other...<br><br>i think the gradual raise in taxi fares will be better than the 50% shoot. starting at 10pm, fares go up 10%, 11pm go up 20%, 12 go up 30%, 1 go up 50%. like that loh.<br><br>another idea i have, but i dun really think taxi companies will accept it. make it so that taxi drivers are paid employees, everyday all the money they collect they return to the taxi company, then at the end of the month the company will pay them according to how much they earn. like.. u bring in $5k, you get paid $3k or something like that.<br><br>they could make it so that the taxi meters not only just record the fare, behind will have a computer so it record the total fare of the day. if the taxi driver wanna ke kiang on whole day then nvr drive, in the end gotta pay up using his own money loh</div>
