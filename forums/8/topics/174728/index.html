Treat it the same with poly.<br><br>General rule: know your strenghts<br><br>1) If u ar epoor in maths, dont choose Engineering<br>2) if u are poor in memory work, dont choose courses like Biz or nursing<br>3) If u are poor in analytical skills, dont choose IT<br><br>Worse come worse<br>4) If u are poor in everything, Just choose anything your heart says so ans accept it.Again up to u, Maybe u would catch up in due time with some initial struggles with the course.

            <div class='col-md body'>Since you don't know what you one, I'll really recommend going to JC instead. After 2 years, you go to army. Then you still have 2 more years to decide what degree you wanna take. Cuz Diploma now everywhere also got. and when you graduate, go army, come out, everyone else is holding on to a bachelor while you are still a diploma grad.<br><br>But if you really want to go Poly, you could go into business, cuz from business, you can work as anything once you get the diploma cuz it's quite a generalised diploma. But the down side is, it's not very specialised, so you'll end up wondering what you can do next.</div>
