            <div class='col-md body'>we went for interview.. and I got in but he did not.. so i suggest another job to him.. but he keep saying don't want..<br><br>He keep saying he can't get a job..<br><br>But the job only last for 2 weeks as its a roadshow.. so he say he can wait for me then can seek job together again..<br><br>I explained to him even if we got the same company there will be high chance of not working together.. But he keep saying no it won't..<br><br>Actually he got a good NTC2 certification in  engineering so i ask him why he don't want to take up engineering job then he say he said it was too long.. 4 years ago liao..he forgot.. somemore its only basic..... I was... shocked.. 4 years ago? then what he did in the past 4 years while waiting for army? He didn't reply...<br><br>Whenever i asked him something about what he want to do .. he always keep quiet and start to have small actions (nervous or hiding away from my question)<br><br>Just feel that he still hiding something from me...<br><br>Then today he tried to took my bag again and refuse to give it to me while i continue browsing the books while he keep guarding my bag..this time it was ok.. because most of the time i was ignoring him and warning him that i will not befriend him if he try to it to me again..<br><br>Sighed..or my job recommendation not suitable for him?<br>Sales job.. recommend Watsons.. but he say the uniform didn't look good.. sighed...but he said he consider if i interview with him....... To me it was like all excuses.. i told him again.. so many outlets it will be different and even the same.. different shift .. he keep saying... we will work together..<br><br>sighed.. like that .....sighed.. i had made it clear to him that after the 2 weeks i will go into corporate sales.. but he said why i always want those funny jobs.. sighed.....<br><br>I hope he made up his mind later to go into retail sales and join Watsons... at least.. for a good start or maybe retail sales is not a suitable first job for him?... if not he keep thinking of those job that are very routined such as packing of goods and doesn't want to handle cash.. doesn't want to talk to customer kind of job...<br><br></div>

I am trying to help him... but sometimes its quite frustrating because he acted like those secondary school time where usually ppl like to take your things and refuse to return to you and expect you to play along with him....<br><br></div>
