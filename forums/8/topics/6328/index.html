            <div class='col-md body'>Rinoa, doing that is pointless as it will only reinforce her thinking that you cannot afford the bag. She might think u r putting on a show. Instead u should tell her to get another salesger from the same branch to serve u, so that she doesn't get to earn the commission...<br><br>------------------<br>Intelligence is like underwear.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hehehe...it's funny when u think of it. Humans are just like that. Whatever doesn't go according to ur way is deem as irritating,<br>lousy, or wrong.<br>When we go into a shop just wanting to browse, and the salesgirls fuss over us, we say that they are irritating. When we go into a shop wanting to buy and no salesgirls attend to us, we say their attitude is bad.<br>Sigh....<br><br>------------------<br>Intelligence is like underwear.

            <div class='col-md body'>Few suggestions...<br><br>I just buy down the franchise for Ferragamo in Singapore, Then say I will go down to the branch to inspect, and then wear the same clothes there and show her who is boss, after that sack her on the spot!(That is if <strong>you</strong> are that filthy rich)<br><br>Wait for her to knock off, chat her up, treat her like a queen then break her heart. (That is if <strong>you</strong> are that good with women.)<br><br>Write to Strait Times and demand a public apology by Ferragamo. And sue them for any reason that your lawyer can find. (That is if <strong>you</strong> are that powerful.)<br><br>Get some Ah Beng to burn the place down. (That is if <strong>you</strong> are that influential in the underworld.)<br><br>Me? I will just go home and laugh myself off at her ignorance, no point getting angry over ignorant people like her.

            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes, I think it's not just the case with so-called "high class designer boutiques" in Sg. Personally, I've had experiences of bad service even in "the usual shops" in the malls.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> Think it's just an attitude problem WITH SOME, though NOT ALL the sales people.<br><br>It's a big difference when you compare the attitude of these people with that of those overseas... They smile, greet you &amp; even show you their latest new arrivals! I was really impressed, even when I told these sale assistants that I'm just browsing &amp; have no intention of buying. In fact, I was so overwhelmed that I bought something in the end! Ok... so I'm a sucker for consumerism!<br>A shopaholic... but @ least I felt I was treated right...as a valued customer should be!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>

The customer is seldom right, and we reserve the right to ignore anyone we think is incapable of making large purchases. We bow only to gold-card wielding customers, and we will lick your boots and your ass if we deem you "able" (to pay that is...). Thank you for shopping with us, we won't wish you a pleasant day because we know we have just ruined it for you. BUt please do return with your money in tow...</div>
