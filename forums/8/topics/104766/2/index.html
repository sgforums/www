The danger all the dentist will tell you is that your wisdom tooth is actually sitting slightly above a nerve which gives your tongue taste. That is the standard the dentist will tell you and make you sign some form. It's just a process to guard themselves.<br><br>the gums which currently hold your teeth vertically in place but because of gum decay which cause by your delay in deciding to extract, the gums will loosen and the wisdom tooth may start to move horizontally inwards your gums causing more pain and more complication if you later finally decide to extract it.<br><br>will be worse off.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ya, not every1 needs to hv their wisdom teeth extracted. if they r growing normally and doesnt cause pain or any other probs, u can juz leave it alone. but there r many cases where there aint much sp left in ur mouth n it causes it to b impacted. if u dun take xtra care n maintain gd oral hygiene, then food might get stuck in the void b/w the wisdom tooth n molar next to it causing decay over time.<br><br><a href="http://www.ndc.com.sg/ndc/WisdomTeeth.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ndc.com.sg/ndc/WisdomTeeth.htm</a><br><br>as a "disclaimer" and to get u prepared, the dentist will normally brief u on the complications of surgery. as some has mentioned b4, the lower set of teeth r near to the nerves linked to ur taste bud and lips so u might feel numbness. the upper set r closer to the nerves linked to ur nose so u might experience sinus or similar probs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i lost weight when i extracted my wisdom tooth the other. Extracted on the right side. Dun dare to extract the left side. so i make sure i brushed my teeth real clean now so as not to infect the left side. My case was quite bad. Did not know that i have allergies to some pain killers and ended up with rashes! so in the end stop taking the pain killers and it was so damn painful.<br>one tip: my dentist told me to rinse my mouth with salt water, to help get rid of bacteria too. Cos the stitch is there and i dun think it is very hygenic with food trapped there.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have 4 total. 2 upper n lower.  the lower right one hurts n gave me many sleepless nites, so went to see d dentist.  took x-ray, confirmed that it is blocked by tooth beside. after injuction of anesthetic, dentist started to pull n 'sway' my tooth, causing it to crack into pieces (u can hear it)  Very painful, told dentist n she inject more anesthetic.  It seems veri difficult cos she is shakin my head with d pullin vigourously.  D assistant had to help hold on my head.  After strugglin veri long, i raised up my hand to signal her to stop, cos my lips are crackin at d corner.  i asked her issit goin to be ok anot, cos she took so long.  She replied, still got about half of tooth left, almost faint.  All the while d anesthetic like no effect, hurts like hell.<br><br>Mine took more than 45mins.  After dat she stitched d wound n have to bite on a cotton pad.  Half side of mouth numbed.  when u laughed or tok, is like u got crooked mouth, only d other half side can move.  Feel like vomitting with d cotton stuck at back of mouth.<br><br>Got MC for 1 week, cost me bout $450.  Thinkin of extractin d upper jaw 2 n will cost bout $80 per tooth cos they r not block, so just normal extraction.  D other lower left side will need operation too cos it is stuck.<br><br>Tink is necessary to extract cos if blockin other teeth, will cause decay (cos not so easy to reach when brushin) and may decay d tooth beside too.<br><br>The dentist is female veri small-sized middle age, dunno issit she female so no strength to pull out dat's why so long.<br><br>No matter how scare u r, must still do it.

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't see what the big fuss is.  Got a needle stuck in my arm, counted backwards from ten to seven before I passed out, and when I woke up both lower wisdom teeth were gone.  Had a bit of dried blood in my mouth, rinsed it out, and by the end of the day I was back to eating solid foods.  Over the next week I had a dull ache a couple of times, which Panadeine Forte easily took care of, and everything was back to normal by the end of the week, save the stitches which took another week to completely dissolve.</div>
