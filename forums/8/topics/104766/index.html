            <div class='col-md body'>The reason behind wisdom tooth removal is that your jaw ain't long enough to take the two extra teeth.  But, if you're lucky(meaning you have wisdom probably :lol<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">, you can take the two extra without need for removal. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>for my experience is quite painful. Firstly I had to remove all 3 of them as they were so called the "offending tooth". Meaning, they cause pain and swollen gum. Went for a x-ray, then schedule to see the specialist. Doctor then told me that my low wisdom tooth is more dangerous and it's really near to my nerves, and the upper one is just as close to the nerve.<br><br>Operation costed about $3.5k. duration of operation is about 30- 45mins. I was put to sleep and they had this tube stuck thru my nose into the throat. Woke up with a very bad sore throat and sinus, not forgetting the 15 stiches i have in my mouth. Couldn't eat solid/ hot food for about 2 weeks.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>After the operation, which your doctor will also tell you that you might not be able to taste (because the nerve damage) and you will feel numbness in the lower jaw. But all these are on individual problem. some ppl might not have this problem.<br><br>As for the big hole in the mouth, it takes about 3 months to be closed up, depending on the size of it. Mine was quite big, they had to cut up the tooth before they can extract it. But they will nicely label the bottle and put your teeth inside for you to bring home. I still keep mine till now... (just few months old lar)<br><br>my advice is that don't extract all at one time or more than 2 at one time unless it's really a must. For my case is that all 3 of the tooth has to be extracted by operation, so each time to book the operating theater, doctors.. cost alot, at least a few thousand. so i rather do all 3 at one time, but really really very painful and miserable, especially during the recovery time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wisdom tooth very dangerous to operate. I went to so many they all wanted to charge so high. 1 clinic initially charged me $300 then raised to $450 and again to $800 ridiculous. I got a feeling they ony wanted to earn consultation and xray fees but didn't have balls to do the actual op hence gave ridiculous pricing and all sorts of excuses blady useless buggers.<br><br>finally a friend recommended so went to a clinic at kallang MRT(can't remember name). The dentist a nice lady very young, very yuppie and very confident extracted on the spot for me with xrays, medication and no excuses, everything for $210. wah I like this type of dentist. very garang unafraid of messy blood and bone flying everywhere very common in wisdom extraction but can see her assistant beside her din feel very comfortable leh hehehe ....<br><br>I recommend anyone with wisdom tooth problem to go kallang MRT dental clinic.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>want to share my painful experience...<br>did it last year. i got 4 wisdom teeth!!! but only decided to pluck 2, on the left side first. the dentist did the anesthetics and my left side of the mouth become totally numb. so no feeling. the dentist pulled and hacked, something broke but i dun feel a thing. so when all was done, i went home. was told to hold the cotton wool in my mouth til it stops bleeding. But 12 hours on, IT WON'T STOP!!! and i had begun to feel the pain! it was very traumatic!!! i couldnt sleep. When it finally stopped, i was exhausted and still scared. I couldnt really eat anything for the next 2 weeks, except drink soup.<br>Then, when i tot it shld be ok, food start to get stuck in the cavity near where the wisdom tooth was. it came to a point where i tot the other tooth will start to rot soon too. So i went back to the dentist. he said it is either i do a bridge or wait for the hole to close. Theoretically it would close itself. The law of rejuvenation? luckily for me, it did close up. things still get stuck sometimes but it wasnt as bad as then.<br>after this traumatic experience, i dun dare to go back to extract the other 2!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess everyone after reading all those past experience will think twice before deciding whether to extract or not..I am also feeling that way, but will anything happen if u never extract the teeth??Will there be any complications or not??</div>
