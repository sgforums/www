            <div class='col-md body'>I don't get it. How can you and her not be happy when u are together? How is that done when both of you are in love? If you have some disagreements, then you have to speak with each other face to face. Else its no use dragging this on. Being with your loved ones should mean happiness and joy.<br>I think i kind of understand your situation. You two have been together for 3 years. That's not a short time. During this period, i can definitely say you two had your laughters and joy. Maybe it's because of the time that the excitement and pureness of the relationship had died down. But this should lead to another thing. Love.<br>Ask her out and talk to her. It's kinda sad to let go after 3 wonderful years.<br>But if she don't appreciate you, you gotta move on.<br>Never stick yourself at any point of your life. Move on and meet someone better. It's always easier for me to say but advise is what we can only do. The rest is up to you.<br><br>------------------<br>-=^Wynternight^=-<br>None as blind or deaf as those who refuses to see or listen.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay from what i have read. I tink you should move on.<br>"alot of stuff happen"<br>I wouldn't ask what stuff but since trust was lost, it won't be easy getting it back. I know people who had difficulties at first and got back together. But later on, they will keep looking back and keep reminding themselves of the 'stuff' that happened. Trust is something that once lost, never to be recovered completely.<br>"im not sure if i wan her back"<br>This just shows that you SHOULD move on. Unless you are VERY VERY determined in getting her back, the misery you are feeling now is due to the time u spent together and the memories.<br>It will pass, believe me.<br>Of course, this is just my advise and i cant say more. You will do what you have to do.<br>All the best and good luck.<br><br>------------------<br>-=^Wynternight^=-<br>None as blind or deaf as those who refuses to see or listen.</div>

Similiarly no matter what happens, you still have your friends and most importantly your PARENTS, ur mum and dad. They care a lot about you so don't hurt their hearts. Take care dude.
