            <div class='col-md body'><strong>This is the email i sended to STforum, Today, TNP and CASE. Thank you all for the supports and advices.</strong><br><br>I am sending in this letter to share this very bad experience on<br>Valentine's Day with this following florist that I engaged for a delivery<br>service.<br><br>On 30th Jan 2005, I went to Xpressflower.com @ Nature's House -<br>Century Square, located at the ground floor of Century Square, to<br>place a delivery order. I ordered 6 stalks of sunflower. Due to the<br>fact that my delivery date was on 14th Feb, which is a peak season,<br>all the charges were increased. The whole package cost $91.50. I paid<br>on the spot by NETS. Also, I requested that I would pass a card to<br>them 1 week later to be delivered together. 1 week later, I went back<br>with the chosen card in red envelop and my receipt with Order No on<br>it, and I passed it to the staff.<br><br>On 14th Feb night itself, I called up the lady who was supposed to<br>receive the bouquet of sunflower to check whether she liked it. And I<br>found out she had not received it. I reminded her to inform me if she<br>received it the next morning.<br><br>On 15th Feb early afternoon, I received an sms from this lady saying<br>that nothing was delivered. I called up the given service number to<br>find out what happened, at 12pm. A female staff answered. I gave her<br>my Order number and mobile number to verify. I was told by her that 1<br>of their trucks broke down yesterday so they were not able to deliver<br>on time. I was angry and disappointed at that time because they did<br>not even bother to give me a call to inform me about this, and if I<br>never checked with that lady, then they might as well ignore my<br>delivery!<br><br>This is very irresponsible. This female staff asked me if they could<br>deliver it on that day. I was frustrated and could not decide at that<br>time, so I requested her to call me back in 30 minutes time. However,<br>no one called me after that. So I called again at 1pm, and talked to<br>that female staff again. I requested them to deliver on that day<br>before during working hour, which she quoted to be before 5pm. At the<br>same time I requested to be given discount because the order was not<br>delivered on time and I was paying a peak season charge. I was<br>rejected, the reason given is, the following day was also considered<br>peak season to them. She could only offer me an extra box of<br>chocolate. As I was too frustrated to argue, I accepted the offer.<br>Then, I mentioned my card in red envelope, and asked them to make sure<br>it is delivered together. She replied that she would look for it.<br><br>At 5.20pm, I received a missed call from this florist. When I called<br>back, I was informed by this female staff that she was just able to<br>find my card and hence the bouquet was not delivered yet! She asked if<br>they could deliver to the residential location. To avoid any<br>inconvenience, I gave her the recipient's contact number (the one on<br>the invoice was wrong), so that she can arrange with the lady<br>directly.<br><br>At around 7.50pm, I called up to check how the status. A guy answered.<br>And I found that it seemed that female staff never contacted the<br>recipient and nothing was arranged! Once again, this guy, with better<br>telephone etiquette, requested the recipient's contact and promised to<br>settle it ASAP, and he will call me back.<br><br>And the fact is, after 1 whole day, I am still waiting for the return call now.<br><br>Just when the Singapore Tourism Board is touting Singapore as a<br>service- oriented industry, the service rendered by the aforementioned<br>florist not only was horrible, but wholly unacceptable.<br><br>No call to apologize when they were not able to deliver their service<br>to a fully paid customer. No sincerity to offer any compensation,<br>apologies for any damage caused.<br><br>The follow-up was terrible. No coordination between staff taking over<br>duty, because obviously the guy knew nothing about my case.<br><br>I hope my letter can raise the awareness of such rampant and<br>unprofessional services.<br><br>Name:<br>Address:<br>Contact:<br><br>P/S: I am still keeping the receipt with order Number with me if you<br>need it for verification. As far as I know, after my discussion in a<br>few local forums, I found out that there is at least another victim<br>who never received her flower on V day itself.<br><br></div>

Go down to the shop, intercept all their customers and tell them yr story. Get their support and pass on the florist's rivals contacts to them.<br><br>Would be best if you spent a weekend there (i.e. 2 days) or during their busiest time to interrupt their business.<br><br>Complain to ST Forum no use. They won't print such news, unless you are someone important or famous.<br><br>If you want maximum impact, create a significant scene (say get 100 folks to gather at the shop and demand refund all at the same time back for you) at the shop and get someone to call the news folks to come down to capture the incident, then you sure get maximum publicity (i.e. on news and in newspapers e.g. in bagua Lianhe Wanbao)!<br><br>But to do all these coordination would take effort and time. Either you let this matter go or if you have lost of pentup tensions, lots of time and energy, do sometime big.<br><br>I await to see this news on TV!<br><br>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
