            <div class='col-md body'>I ordered some flowers, from this florist Xressflower 2 weeks ago, on 31st Jan, to be delivered to a lady on yesterday, 14th Feb. Of coz, yesterday is a hot date, got extra surcharges, i paid $91.50 for 6 stalks of sunflowers with delivery on 14th Feb, yes expensive, but it is ok.<br>then i happily, n nervously wait till yesterday, at night, i called the lady, she DIN NOT receive! ****, maybe her family havent brought to her, so nvm. this morning, she sms me, her family NEVER receive any flower! i was so frustrated.<br>so i called up Xpressflower and asked. Then i was told ONE OF THEIR DRIVEN'S TRUCK BROKE DOWN, so those were never delivered! FISH, not even a call to inform or apologize, NOT EVEN A CALL, and i have to call up and ask then I know, FISH FISH. what kind of service issit? Their business so good, cant they know how important yesterday is to some customers? If i act cool never call her (she din know in advance, meant to be a surprise), then i never know it was not delivered, and they will just ignore act blur n makan my money. THIS IS RUBBISH.<br>I will never go back and buy anything, an i will tell all my friends not to do so. I will.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>bloody hell, it is not over yet! the following is the whole story:<br><br>On 30th jan 2005, i went to this Xpressflower.com @ Nature's House - Century Square, ground to make order with delivery. I ordered 6 stalks of sunflower. Due to the fact that my delivery date was on 14th Feb, which is a peak season, all the charges  were increased. The whole package costed me $91.50, including the flowers n delivery. I paid on the spot by NETS. Also, I requested that I would pass them a card to them 1 week later to be delivered together. 1 week later, I went back with the chosen card in red envelop and my receipt with Order No on it, and I passed it to the staff.<br><br>On 14th Feb night itself, I called up the lady who is supposed to receive to bouquet of sunflower to check she liked it. And I found out she had not received it. Well, I thought may be the family hasn't passed her the bouquet, so I reminded her to inform me if she received it the next morning.<br><br>On 15th Feb early afternoon, I received an sms from this lady saying that nothing was delivered. I called up the given service number to find out what happened, at 12pm. A female staff answered. I gave her my Order numbr and mobile number to verify. I was told by her that 1 of their truck broke down yesterday so they were not able to deliver on time. I was so angry and disappointed at that time becasue they did not even bother to give me a call to inform me about this, and if I never check with that lady then they might as well ignore my delivery! This is very irresponsible. This female staff asked me if they can deliver it on that day. I was frustrated and could not decide at that time, so I requested her to call me back in 30 minutes time. However, no one called me aftre that. So I called again at 1pm, and talked to that female staff again. I requested them to deliver on that day before during working hour, which she quoted to be before 5pm. At the same time I requested to be given discount because the order was not delivered on time and I was paying a peak season charge. I was rejected, the reason given is, the following day is also considered peak season to them. She could only offer me an extra box of chocolate. OK, fine, I am too frustrated to argue so I accepted. Then, I mentioned my card in red envelop, and asked them to make sure it is delivered together. She replied that she would look for it.<br><br>At 5.20pm, I received a miss called from this florist. When I called back, I was informed by this female staff that she was just able to find my card and hence the bouquet was not delivered yet! What the hell is it, I was cursing in my heart. She asked if they can deliver to the residential location. To avoid any inconvenience, I gave her the recipient's contact number (the one on the invoice was wrong), so that she can arrange with the lady directly.<br><br>At around 7.50pm, I called up to check how the status. A guy answered. And I found that it seemed that female staff never contacted the recipient and nothing was arranged! Once again, this guy, with better telephone ettiquent, requested the recipient's contact and promised to settled it ASAP, and he will call me back.<br><br>I am still waiting for the return call now.<br>I have decided to write to ST, TODAY and CASE to lodge a complaint. Their service is horrible. No courtesy call to apologize or whatever when they are not able to deliver their service for a fully paid customer. No sincerity to offer any conpensation, apology for any damage caused, just want to get the job done fast and obviously they fail this also. I seriouly doubt that the truck broking down is just an excuse, and very possible that my order was neglected. MY lady may never receive the flower if i never bother to call and check, or i assume that everything will be done nicely. The follow-up is terrible. No coordination between staff taking over duty, because obviously the guy know nothing about my case. It is the worst service that i have encoutered in Singapore.<br></div>
