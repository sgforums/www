About 80,000 based on last known figure.<br><br>I was given the impression that singapore is so attractive to MNCs that all prefer singapore as place to setup plants, companies, branches, HQs over the other SE.Asian countries.<br><br>Malaysia has 10 times more people than singapore requiring work. Why are they able to provide millions and millions more jobs than singapore?<br>If Malaysia Boleh, Singapore?<br>USA also has 100 times more people requiring work. They are able to provide 10's of millions more jobs. Why not singapore?<br><br>Singapore population needs to double at least in the next few decades. If for the last 5 years, unemployment hover at around just under 100k, would there be job for my child? Would there be job left to offer me till I am 65?<br><br>Singapore leaders are all excellent. But I cannot understand why unemployment exist at such a comparatively high number when we are only asking for 80k jobs. Why can this not be met? If so, how to solve it? I have been waiting for an answer for 5 years.<br><br>Assuming singapore will double its population. How is it going to generate 2 million more jobs when 80k jobs are missing for 5 straight years?<br>I am amazed at the confidence of our leaders.<br><br>Given all the geographical, political, social, educational advantage that singapore has, why are we still not able to generate sufficient jobs employable of singaporeans? Was there a 10 year plan to forecast job demands and prepare the youths for it? If yes, did it work? If it did, what happen to last 5 years? There can be a plan for everything. But what matters is whether it is effective. I can have a 1 million dollar security system that does not work effectively. And then what?<br><br>From now on, we should have an early warning system to prevent what happened the last 5 years. If only we forecasted the problems and taken proactive and preventative actions? Would that have helped?<br><br>As more jobs are created, more FTs come in, unrestricted. Then what?<br>The more important issue is the 80k jobless, if we consider them important at all. Are we so sure our FT policies and especially its handling<br>is flawless? Can we provide FTs all the jobs they want while at the same time provide jobs for all singaporeans which are only a small number?<br><br>If singapore, a tiny city, could not generate enough job for a small population, can we consider singapore as a better country than say Malaysia which in terms of job creation is 10 times better than singapore?<br><br>A large country is harder to manage. Yet, they can provide more jobs. So what is missing?<br><br>Can singaporeans depend on singapore to provide job opportunities or they have to adopt other countries to feed themselves?<br><br>I myself has been jobless for the last 3 years. I have no choice now but to look abroad for greener pastures. I did not try before as I did not think I have the character suitable for it. But now, its either I stay broke here or I suffer a little and at least get to earn some money abroad.<br><br>I feel like I am the bangla who works here. I can emphatise with them now. Before we look down on a thai, china, india construction worker, think how tough they are to be able to work abroad. They have the courage, the determination to earn a living abroad.<br><br>toomanyjobs?<br><br>Last edited by toomanyjobs on Sun Apr 03, 2005 10:14 am; edited 2 times in total<br><br>Back to top<br><br>prodigal<br><br>Joined: 10 Dec 2004<br>Posts: 423<br><br>Posted: Sat Apr 02, 2005 9:00 pm    Post subject:<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Give high paying jobs to FTs, when foreign MNCs come in with their highly paid CEOs, many jobs are created.<br><br>Give the low paying jobs to FTs as our ppl dun want to take it up.<br><br>What do we get?

I do!<br><br>My answers to your questions:<br>1. Yes....why not if the job is right. I believe we do have local talents that can outshine FT.<br>2. Depending on which coin-side you are looking at. As a professional, I believe Singaporeans can compete. Problem....opportunity is given more to foreigners cause of two reasons....they look better...or their pay is lesser.<br>3. Many Singaporean are willing to but why so many are not able to is because of the cost of living in Singapore (top 10 in the whole freaking earth)<br>4. Not really...most of our politicians are hand picked by the government based on the fact that they are scholars. They need not prove themselves or sell themselves........look at some of them....they cannot even do a decent presentation.

They tell me they are not interested to become citizens. They prefer to have the best of both worlds. The government beg them many times to convert to citizens but they are simply not interested. Best part they employ their own FT people as so easy to get work permit. So instead of locals getting jobs they go to FTs. They tell me once they make enough money they will fold the company and pack and go home. Too bad if no jobs for locals, afterall he said he must help his own people first.<br>So don't understand the logic why so easy to give work permit to FTs?<br>Meanwhile so many locals no jobs and getting desperate and stressful. That's why so many suicides cases and jumping onto MRT tracks!<br><br>Back to top<br><br>Spiritanto<br><br>Joined: 13 Apr 2004<br>Posts: 921<br><br>Posted: Thu Jun 09, 2005 8:38 am    Post subject:<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>cw wrote:<br>My uncle and father are all welders... but becos of FT... become no jobs!! cos they are hell alot cheaper...<br><br>thesedays i see more and more china woman everywhere... some as helpers in hawker stalls and some as hookers... so are these the FTs we should be welcoming??<br><br>You mean welders are FTs ( FOREIGN TALENTS? ) .

My personal opinion based on experience in job hunting and from industry friends is that FTs are not CHEAP. Please note that or you are living in your own unreal world.<br><br>In the construction industry, laborers are indeed cheaper than locals who have lots more to pay as living expenses. That is the difference. In terms of nett savings or income, I think not diff by much.<br><br>In IT industry, FTs are not cheap anymore, probably since 3 years ago.<br>To get an indian IT person is so easy that it takes merely a few days to grant permits. Given that the entire world is supplying IT labor to singapore, its created a problem for locals certified but fresh. Basically, there is no longer a need to hire fresh when price of fresh can be used to pay price of 2 years experienced IT FT from afar.<br><br>So, what you say is over-generalising the state of employment in singapore.<br><br>Back to top<br><br>rickdees<br><br>Joined: 08 Jun 2005<br>Posts: 3<br><br>Posted: Thu Jun 09, 2005 11:57 pm    Post subject:<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>juz to put it simply, do you know how many "Indian national" computer/electrical engineers are churned out each day in India? how much pay do you think they are willing to work in Singapore? and they r as qualified as the locals.<br><br>Back to top<br><br>lotitok<br><br>Joined: 27 May 2005<br>Posts: 7<br><br>Posted: Fri Jun 10, 2005 8:15 am    Post subject:<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>y dont Singaporeans leave this country n be a Foreign talent somewhere else instead of waiting for Singapore to create more jobs.  seek wat u want.<br><br>Back to top<br><br>Display posts from previous: All Posts1 Day7 Days2 Weeks1 Month3 Months6 Months1 Year Oldest FirstNewest First<br><br>Channelnewsasia Forum Forum Index -&gt; Community All times are GMT + 8 Hours<br><br>Page 1 of 1<br><br>Jump to: Select a forum Your Say----------------Arts &amp; EntertainmentBusinessCommunityEducationEnvironmentHealthIn the NewsLeisureSportTechnologyTravelWorld Issues Finance Forums----------------Currency TalkFutures TalkMarket Talk<br><br>You cannot post new topics in this forum<br>You cannot reply to topics in this forum<br>You cannot edit your posts in this forum<br>You cannot delete your posts in this forum<br>You cannot vote in polls in this forum<br><br>Powered by phpBB Â© 2001, 2005 phpBB Group<br><br></div>
