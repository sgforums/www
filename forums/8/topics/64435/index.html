            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">by K.K. Cheow</span><br><br>In a personal coup for the Economic Development Board, worldwide toy distributor Santa Claus has decided to relocate his workshop to Singapore.<br><br><img src="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/images/stories/yeohoho.gif"><br><br>At a press conference to announce the huge development, EDB Co-Chairman Mr. Phillip Yeo told the audience that Â“With Santa, itÂ’ll be Christmas all year round in Singapore!Â”<br><br>After being introduced as Â“the ultimate foreign talentÂ” by Mr. Yeo, Mr. Claus himself emerged to thunderous applause, dressed in his trademark red suit.<br><br>Â“There are a number of reasons why I decided to relocate to Singapore,Â” he said, smiling. Â“For instance, you have a great policy towards unions, which is that they should not be able to hold a business hostage just because they think their unemployment terms are inequitable.Â”<br><br>Â“Fucking elves,Â” he added. Â“They were demanding things like better pay and the right to industrial action without official approval. Next thing you know, the reindeer were seeking to unionize, and wanted final say on any terms negotiated with me. That was impossible. If the reindeer went on strike, no one would get any presents on Christmas.Â”<br><br>Mr. Claus also cited the Singapore authoritiesÂ’ cooperative spirit as another reason for his move. Â“You folks have some really advanced systems here. For instance, IÂ’m grateful to the Internal Security Department for loaning me their special software to help me assess whoÂ’s been naughty or nice.Â”<br><br>Mr. Claus further said he valued SingaporeÂ’s openness to foreign talent, as well as its reverence for Â“elderly menÂ”.<br><br>Mr. Claus, however, evaded questions about the persistent rumour that a very senior member of the ruling family had personally persuaded him to relocate. When queried about who this might be, Mr. Claus merely responded, Â“Ho ho hoÂ” and journalists could not come to a consensus about whether he had uttered a barely audible Â“chingÂ” at the end of his trademark chuckle.<br><br>SantaÂ’s Workshop (S) Pte Ltd (in which Temasek Holdings has taken a minority stake) will set up its new plant in Woodlands in the north of Singapore. Mr. Claus, however, declined to take up Deputy Prime Minister Tony TanÂ’s suggestion that his factory be called Â‘SantopolisÂ’. To make up for any perceived slight, however, Mr. Claus said heÂ’d be giving DPM Tan a bottle of Bigen Hair Dye in his stocking this year, instead of the usual tub of Code 10.<br><br>Mr. Claus also announced that his Christmas Eve delivery sorties will take place at Seletar Airbase, aboard several specially-manufactured light aircraft designed by Singapore Technologies and flown by retrenched Singapore Airlines pilots. Meanwhile, Rudolph and the other reindeer will be retired to the Mandai Zoo. (Whether as exhibits or meat, Santa declined to confirm.)<br><br>In what is seen as an especial coup for Singapore, Santa will not be bringing any elves to staff his new plant, and will instead be relying entirely on local labour.<br><br>Â“Well, most of you are short farts already anyway,Â” said Mr. Claus. Â“No big diff to me.Â”<br><br>The elves, however, are considering mounting a challenge to Mr. ClausÂ’ relocation with the World Trade Organization.<br><br>Meanwhile, Malaysia has lodged a complaint with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, accusing Singapore of increasing tension with its Muslim neighbours by bringing in such an obvious icon of the Christian calendar.<br><br>Mr. Claus angrily dismissed such concerns, thundering, Â”Jesus Christ! WhatÂ’ve I got to do with Christianity? These Malaysians are always trying to stir shit. Just for that, this Christmas, IÂ’m going to give every Malaysian kid a bottle of Newater.Â”</div>
