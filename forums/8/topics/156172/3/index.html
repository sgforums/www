            <div class='col-md body'>Sad to say, there may not be a heaven and hell after death. The images and what you are taught about heaven and hell are formed in this living plane.<br><br>Based on your past, present and future existence, the heaven and hell are what you make of them right now.  When people visit 3rd world countries and see beggars living in bad conditions, they cry 'living hell'. And when they slurp on a delicious ice cream at Swensens, they sing 'heavenly'.  And  if you practice good, others will do the same to you and you will be in heaven. If you do bad, others will take revenge and you will be in hell.<br><br>When you die, or if your head is blown apart from your chest, you can't be in heaven or hell but freeze at the frame where the bomb exploded. The image appears in newspaper front pages worldwide and that is interpreted as  'heaven' for being the maytr. Because, when you die, some parts of your body disintegrate and you are left with only a portion. If that portion of cells is your memory and they are still organic, some other living beings may sense them, and they just conveniently interprete that as soul.<br><br>Thats why human think there are ghosts in this world. When you die, others reduce you to ashes and keep you in an urn. That way, you won't 'reincarnate' but become an inanimate object stuck in some dusty old cabinet and the memory will provoke those living to perceive that the person has not died but floating in the surroundings and answering all prayers.<br><br>If your ashes are scattered in the seas. Sea creatures will ingest all your bone nutrients and you 'reincarnate' as fishlets, shrimps, sotong or some starfish. If the sea water is washed ashore or evaporated, they become nutrients for the plants and you become carrots, potatoes or pumpkins. If someone eats them, the ingested cells become part of a pregnant woman and you reincarnate as  her child. Thus,  the cells are scattering like some invisible dengue in this plane, but due to ozone layer problems, some might well settle on mars or other distant planets. so there is no make believe heaven like what you see when looking out  the windows of a plane or hell when you dig 100 meters underground or visit a bomb shelter. The greatest evil and the best deeds lie in people's heart and humans beings like anyone including yourself can be  the most feared and most desired, much like playing the role of god or the devil.<br><br>In conclusion, you should think along this line and develop this theory for submission to the nobel prize committe for award nomination. When it is published worldwide, people, regardless of race, religion, colour, or creed will then know of ways to prepare and enjoy their heaven in this lifetime, than wait in desperation for some 60-80 years till they are brain dead or cease their last breath to book a place there. Think of it like the money in your CPF, if you can take it out now and know how to invest, you can have heavenly $ in your later years. If you spend it away, you will be hellish $ broke right now. So, these are your actions of heaven and hell.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Li Ka Shing:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi,<br><br>Assuming a suicide bomber really believes in his deepest heart that he is fighting a holy war and believes it is noble to blow himself and others up and it will get him to heaven, will this man go to heaven or hell for his action?<br><br>Well you get my idea.<br><br>From a religious philosophical point of view, if somebody carry out an act which he deems virtuous, is this suffice to make him go to heaven, even if others deem the act extremely the opposite of being a virtue and will land him in hell?<br><br>Is virtue and sin relative?

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>It's great reading all the replies here, be it jokes or serious ones. Some of the jokes are so funny and some serious ones made me really think.<br><br>Nobody answered my original question though. My question was: from religious philosophical point of view, if someone believes an act is a virtue, and carry out such act, does this person go to heaven or hell?<br><br>You see, I know other people believe suicide bombing is a sin. But they are not the ones who carry out suicide bombing, are they? The suicide bombers are the ones who believe it is actually a virtue instead. What Im asking is, therefore, is virtue and sin relative? Is it relative to each individual's understanding? From religious philosophical point of view. What do u think? If an individual really believe in his deepest heart that he is carrying out a virtuous act, in his honest understanding of his religion, is this sufficient to land him in heaven?<br><br>Let's take out the term 'suicide bombing' first because it is strongly biased and will cloud our judgement. Let's just use the term 'act'. Im asking this question. Will someone who carry out an act which he believe is a virtue in his understanding of his religion, go to heaven? Please think and answer this question without regard to what others understand as virtue and sin. Im asking about a single particular individual with his own understanding of his religion and his own understanding of virtue and sin. And whether from religious philosophical point of view, it is justifiable for him to go to heaven.<br><br>What is your answer to this question?</div>
