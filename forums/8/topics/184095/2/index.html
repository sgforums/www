They most likely think that it's ok for guys to be like that since they will have a wife to look after him. (I wonder which girl will take that crap)<br><br>And your brother is smart. He knows that if he doesn't do it, someone will pick up after him anyway....although that will lead him to his failure in life if he doesn't wake up.<br><br>He doesn't think that studying is a big deal because right now, everyone picks up his shit for him.
