Dun seem to be effective leh.<br><br>Anyway, no matter how hard she tries, she cannot change her poor genes that are responsible for her lousy complexion. Sure, she can learn to behave elegant but it will take time. However, she cannot help it too with poor genes for skin texture.<br><br>So we should give her credit for her efforts and let her age lah.<br><br>Aging is not a crime, but I agree that she should retire loh or play ah ma roles. Young career women roles are not suitable for her anymore as her face shows too many crow-lines. Botox should be able to delay her aging signs for sometime but not much.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>dunno why Zoe Tay does not look as good on TV as in real life.<br>That's why people (those who hate her, and those who don't) say that she looks haggard, old etc.  I saw her twice in real life.  In each of the two encounters, I stood very near to her, even stood beside her to take a picture.  Her skin is flawless.  On Tv, we could always say she conceals her lines with makeup and lightings.  But the truth is, in real life, she looks very charming.  No wonder Simon Yum (the HK actor who acted with her a few years ago, the SK2 model Gigi's husband) told the media that Zoe Tay is a charming lady.<br><br>She has a pair of big bright eyes that could "talk".  Again, not sure why, her eyes in real life look a lot nicer than on TV when the TV makeup is supposed to make her look more unflawed.  Nice features (esp her nose and eyes).<br><br>She is quite a broadminded person, easy to get along with even at first meeting.  I remember the first time I saw her, my intern was ga-ga over her.  My intern asked to take a picture with Zoe Tay.  And straightaway she said,"ok", in a very friendly and warm manner.  "Come stand beside me.  Philip (her husband), hold the camera."<br><br>She is totally the opp of "Miss Flat Face" - who gives me the "Who-The-F**k-Are-You" kind of look when I was introduced to her at a function.  I shall not elaborate my first hand encounter in this thread.</div>

People tend to have the idea that once a person passes 30, he/she is old, esp if she's a woman.  I am sure if Zoe Tay hides or lies about her age, people will say otherwise.</div>
