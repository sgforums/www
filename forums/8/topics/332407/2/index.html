              <p>I feel the need to post an arguement on this thread... then I remembered the story of the father, the son and the goat...</p>
              <p>Summrized version:-</p>
              <p>A father and his son were traveling and they had a goat with them... The father asked the son to ride the goat so he won't get tired... when they passed by a group of travellers, the elder of the group said, "What an ungracious son, sitting like a king while his father suffer"<br><br>So the father asked the son to get off and he rode the goat instead... then they passed another group of travellers, and the elder of the group said, "What kind of father is this? Letting the son suffer while the rides like a king"<br><br>Then the father asked the son to join him and they rode the goat together, then they met another group of thavellers, and the elder of the group said, "This is cruelty to animals, letting the goat carry the weight of 2 humans"<br><br>Then they both got off and walked on foot and they met another group of travellers and the elder of the group said, " You 2 stupid izzit? Got goat then don't want to ride...?"</p>
              <p>Moral of the story...</p>
              <p>I learnt a long time ago not to give a damn about what strangers think of me... I believe what I believe... I believe its of to drink on MRT and train as long as the drink has no smell and didn't make a mess...</p>
              <p>I believe that children should be allowed to play on the MRT as long as they don't inconvenient any other passangers coz children should have fun b4 they start to stress out about exams in 2-3 years time...</p>
              <p>And I believe that if I got a seat and in for a long travel, might as well catch some sleep rather than sit there like idiot with nothing to do... And I don't care if my mouth open  coz I know if my mouth don't open when I sleep in sitting position, I will have problems breathing...</p>

              <p>What's wrong with sleeping!?</p>
              <p>Sometimes people like to catch a little snooze on the way home... For some of us it's the only time we can squeeze in the extra hours we need... Not everyone has the luxury of sleeping a full seven to eight hours every night... I know many people who get by at three to four a night... Six is considered a luxury. You should know that some of these people are just students.</p>

              <p>wah piang TS you bery the fussy <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/sad.png" alt="sad.png"></p>
              <p>things that doesn't appeal to you doesn't mean it cannot be shown.</p>
              <p>you say people sleep open mouth or drool. you want them to shut their mouth when sleeping? its like asking a person who snores to stop snoring. you think they want open their mouths when they sleep?</p>
              <p>TS say if the person has no source of entertainment. no PSP no MP3 no newspaper no crap. if there are empty seats, should the person stand up and stare blankly into space till he reached his destination of 1hour later? you really think people like to sleep in the mrt? because journey long thats why they sleep. because nothing to do. you ask SMRT install TVmobile la. that should stop the sleeping issue.</p>
              <p>if you ever try to be a smart alek and try to bring this up as a suggestion to SMRT, please be considerate for the poor folks in sg who have to cope with another round of increament in train fares <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/sad.png" alt="sad.png"></p>

              <p>hi bro you have a point there. but you cannot link people eating smelly toufu with sleeping. its totally 2 different things <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/sad.png" alt="sad.png"></p>
              <p>feedback yes. but something as trivial as people sleeping with their mouths open and drool? so do you want to see a Fine $500 sign for sleeping in the train next time <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/sad.png" alt="sad.png"></p>
              <p>so if one day someone with BO comes and SIT OR STAND beside TS, is he going to open another thread saying, "People with BO shouldn't even take the train"?</p>
              <p>to me, this isn't a feedback. this is simply just, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">whining</span>.</p>

              dont think you can control. who wants to sleep on the train if u could have the comfort of ur own bed?
              come to think of it, isnt it quite entertaining to watch the jokers drool? haha. brightens up the monotonous mrt journey dont you think?

              <p>hi bro you have a point there. but you cannot link people eating
              smelly toufu with sleeping. its totally 2 different things
              <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/sad.png" alt="sad.png"></p>
              <p>feedback yes. but something as trivial as people sleeping with
              their mouths open and drool? so do you want to see a Fine $500 sign
              for sleeping in the train next time <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/sad.png" alt="sad.png"></p>
              <p>so if one day someone with BO comes and SIT OR STAND beside TS,
              is he going to open another thread saying, "People with BO
              shouldn't even take the train"?</p>
              <p>to me, this isn't a feedback. this is simply just, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">whining</span>.</p>

              <p>yep, i know that sometimes when topics are created, we have to judge the maturity of the thread. for this once, he just whining..but the people just hamdaming him like mad.. not fair also.</p>
              <p>yes, he may be making a small point, but is the way forward, to make people keep quiet leh?</p>

              <p>Yup. Why not have seats for sleeping people, then it is like seperated by a sheet of substance that is strong on heat-resistance. Throw in free pillow oso can...</p>
