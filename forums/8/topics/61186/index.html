            <div class='col-md body'>ha ha this is a good one.  not really a scary ghost story but a bumbling one.<br><br>not too long ago, while serving my NS as a recruit in BMT, we all slept in a communcal bunk.  well, two beds away from me was this singh and as guys should all know, just prior to entering the army, we all get to hear those ghost stories of haunted bunks in Tekong.<br><br>Bearing this in mind, one night while in the half conscious state, i turned in my bed and saw this long haired 'woman' (it was a dark shadowy form) next to the singh's bed.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  needless to say, i was terrified! I shut my eyes and opened them again to peep, worse the thing was now sitting on the bed (i really wondered how was singh then).  now totally freaked, i forced myself to sleep.<br><br>the next morning, when i asked around, i found out that my likely apparition was actually ah singh himself!  he went to shower really late and the 'woman' was actually him w/o the turban and he was drying his hair when i saw him.  Arrgghh  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>So much for haunted bunks...</div>
