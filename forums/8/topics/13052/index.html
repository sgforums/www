Firstly<br><br>1. You had subcribe or join any community. Like you join a message board community like SGforum, you typed in your Email address in the form field... so the Community needs to generate cash and income, therefore they place ads by giving some other companies your email address.<br><br>2. Sometimes your friend may recommand you something... then you will recieve what they recommand you.<br><br>3. Or your email address contains a recorded value. Your email address may seems unique, but if you subcribe a mail like; free_john@hotmail.com, you will recieve many junk mails. The word 'Free' is recorded in the mailer's database, they will mail to all addresses account with the word 'Free' If you dun believe, make a new account using 'Free'@hotmail.com<br><br>4. You may be randomly picked. Like for example, They check your ICQ interest. Found you have interest on games, they automactically sent you a mail using a mail Generator.<br><br>I suggest either you change another mail account, or put the secruity level to classified junk mails or inbox mails.<br><br>you can always Subcribe another email address at <a href="http://sukoru.zzn.com" rel="nofollow">http://sukoru.zzn.com</a><br>----------------------------------------&gt;<br>Another email service coming up, tune in to <a href="http://sukomail.cjb.net" rel="nofollow">http://sukomail.cjb.net</a>  &lt; Under construct,.<br><br>------------------<br>&lt;html&gt;&lt;Head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;Body&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;HR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;<br>My life is bitter...
