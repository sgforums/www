            <div class='col-md body'>Of course smoking is a personal choice. Even with regard to second-hand smoke, you always have a choice to walk away from it.<br><br>If the woman featured in ST didn't smoke, and got lung cancer, why is the fault pointed at smoking?<br><br>There is no doubt that smoking raises the smoker's risk of lung cancer. However, the link to second-smoke hand is less clear because we do not know enough about how much other pollutants can cause lung cancers. Furthermore, since most enclosed places are smoke-free, the amout of cigarettes smoke inhaled by non-smokers is many, many times less that inhaled by smokers. So the non-smoking woman who got lung cancer may have been poisoned by something else in the air besides second-hand smoke. There are other sources of carcinogens in the air besides those from cigarette smoke, for example, cooking fumes, car exhaust etc. Or who says lung cancer must be caused by something in the air; it may be something that one eats or drinks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ain't life a bitch?  Smokers want the freedom to puff, non-smokers wants justice for the shortening of their life by smokers.<br><br>So how?  Very hard issue to handle man left also wrong, right also wrong.  As a ex-smoker I know the feeling of smokers, but as a non-smoker now I also know the torture the nons are going through.  I think there's no clear answer to this problem.<br><br>P.S.
