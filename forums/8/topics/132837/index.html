            <div class='col-md body'>They are bed bugs. I had them before, they came back with me after my army reservist training. Here are some hardcore facts about them. Some from my experience, some from reading up on the internet.<br><br>1) By the time you notice them, the infestion is quiet serious. Why? these bugs hide in dark places and  come out only at night, homing on your smell or sweat. But by morning, they disappear, back into their hiding places. So you don't see them. For some strange reasons, the smell from your hair turn them on. When you are sound asleep, they creep up to your hair and bite you between your hair frolicles. Because your head has the least sensory nerves, you wouldn't notice the infestion for a long, long time.<br><br>2) If you cannot sleep at night, the infestion is extremely serious. It means that there are hundreds of them competing for food, ie your blood. Because of their large numbers, they are no longer discreet. Their bits can be on your legs, arms, body and not just on your head (that is why you cannot sleep). In the worst case, they will even bite you in the daytime. When hungry, survival first, discreet second.<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>3) "The mature bed bug is a brown- to mahogany-colored, wingless insect. Its size depends on how recently it has eaten a blood meal. An unfed bed bug is between 1/4 and 3/8 inches long. The upper surface of its body has a papery, crinkly, flimsy appearance. When engorged with blood, its body becomes elongated and swollen, and its color changes from brown to dull red. The color, size, and shape change from an unfed to a full bug is remarkable."<br><br>"A female can deposits up to five eggs a day and 500 during a lifetime. The eggs are tiny, whitish, and hard to see without magnification (about the size of a dust spec). When first laid, the eggs are sticky, causing them to adhere to substrates. Newly hatched nymphs are no bigger than a pinhead. As they grow, they shed their skin five times before reaching maturity. A blood meal is needed between each successive shedding. Under favorable conditions, the bugs can complete development in as little as a month, producing three or more generations per year."<br><br>"The female lays her eggs in batches of 10 to 50, they are white in colour and deposited on various surfaces with a thin glue. They take on average 10 days to hatch and can mature into adults within one to two months given ample food. The female is then ready to start laying eggs. The speed of development depends on temperature and food availability. Bed bugs can live longer without food and can go without feeding for up to 140 days; the adult typically lives for about 10 months but can survive for a year or longer in cool buildings. This sensitivity to temperature means bed bugs will start to die if temperatures drop below 9ÂºC or rise above 36ÂºC."<br><br>"Bed bug eggs are white and about 1/3-inch long. Under favorable conditions the female bed bug lays about 200 eggs at the rate of 3 or 4 per day. Eggs have a sticky coating and stick to objects where they are laid. It usually takes the eggs 6 to 17 days to hatch, and the newly emerged nymphs will feed immediately. A bed bug goes through five molts (shedding of its skin) before it reaches maturity. Depending on environmental factors and the availability of food, there can be considerable variation in developmental rate. Bed bugs may live for several weeks to several months without feeding, depending on temperature."<br><br>"A bed bug generally feeds at night, but if it is hungry and the area has a dim light, it may feed during the day. A bed bug generally pierces the skin of humans as they sleep. It injects a fluid into the human skin to aid in obtaining blood. Often this fluid causes a welt on the skin that becomes irritated, inflamed, and itchy. If left undisturbed, a full-grown bed bug becomes engorged with blood in 3 to 5 minutes. It then crawls into hiding, remaining there for several days to digest its meal. When hunger returns, the bug emerges from hiding and seeks another blood meal."<br><br>"Heavily used hiding places are evident by black or brown spots of dried blood excrement on the surfaces where the bugs rest. Eggs, egg shells, and cast skins may be found near these places. Usually there is an offensive odor where bed bugs are numerous. In early infestations the bed bugs are found only about the tufts, seams, and folds of mattresses and daybed covers; later they spread to cracks and crevices in the bedsteads. If allowed to multiply, they establish themselves behind baseboards, window and door casings, pictures, and moldings, and in furniture, loosened wallpaper, and cracks in plaster and partitions."<br><br>"To control bed bugs in the home, find all their hiding places and treat them with an insecticide labeled for this use (see table). Select a product whose label specifies bed bugs. Do not apply an insecticide directly to the mattress unless the label specifically gives directions for this use. For these insecticides, apply a light mist to the entire mattress to penetrate the seams, tufts, and folds. Allow the mattress to dry for several hours before use. As it may be impossible to penetrate all hiding places immediately, control may not be immediate and bugs may be seen for several days after treatment. However, if bugs persist for 2 weeks or more, it is advisable to do a second treatment. For heavily infested homes or apartments, a commercial pest control operator should be consulted to control the infestation. Read and follow all labeled the instructions carefully."<br><br>"List of pesticides labeled to control bed bugs.<br>Allethrin<br>Delta Dust* - 0.05% (deltamethrin)<br>Drione* Dust<br>Flee*/Dragnet FT* - 0.5% spray<br>Pyrethrins<br>Resmethrin - 0.3% spray<br>Suspend SC* - 0.6% spray<br>Tempo 2* - 0.05Ã�0.1% spray<br>Tempo 0.1% dust*<br>Tempo 20 WP*"<br><br>All above 3) from the net.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>4) If the infestion is serious, the desinfectant that you can buy from supermarket will not be effective (even if they are meant for bed bugs). Too little in content, too general in purposes.<br><br>First you should throw away your bed if possible. Or sun your mattress (under very hot burning sun. Saw and learn from my BMT's CSM).<br><br>Secondly, you have to vacuum your house thoroughly (a few times a week). For serious infestion, bed bugs are found not only in bed but also under chairs, sofa, cabinet, carpet, cracks on walls etc. Dark places, wooden places like cupboard, pillow (even inside of the pillow) and mattress are their favourite spots. After vacuuming, tie your vacuum bag tightly before throwing them away. After each round of vacuuming, you have to desinfect your vacuum cleaner with boiling water. Yes, the sucking tube as well.<br><br>Thirdly, I know of this method that I saw in the army. I will mention it but for health reason would not recommend it, especially if you are suffering from respiratory illness. It's at your discretion. It seems like kerosene has disinfectant effect on bed bugs. Alternatively, for safety reason, you can look up The Straits Times' Classified- pest control and buy commercial disinfectant. They are usually in liquid form. Use a brush to paint the disinfectant liquid on the underside of the chairs, the cupboard, the table, the bed etc. Generally, places that are away from the light. (Spray with a light mist will not work for serious infestion.)<br><br>Fourthly, this is very important. You have to keep disinfecting your home after the bit has stop. Bed bugs can live up to months without food and the eggs can take 2 weeks to hatch. When you think that they are dead and gone, they can be lurking somwhere and the eggs can be waiting to be hatched and can alive again. If you cannot control them, you should call up a commerical pest controller. Untreated, they can infest your neighbour, your relative, your work place and the public place such as the bus and MRT.<br><br>Check out these websites<br><br>http://exterminating-supplies.com/bedbug.asp<br>http://www.fagerlund.addr.com/bed_bugs.htm<br>http://www.ext.vt.edu/pubs/entomology/444-420/444-420.pdf<br>http://www.ext.vt.edu/pubs/entomology/444-420/444-420.html<br>http://www.uky.edu/Agriculture/Entomology/entfacts/struct/ef636.htm<br>http://217.154.68.186/pestnews/homepest/bedbugs.htm<br>http://www.huntsdc.gov.uk/Environment+and+Planning/Pest+control/Bed+bugs.htm<br>http://www.uky.edu/Agriculture/Entomology/entfacts/struct/ef636.htm</div>

Anyway, the adult one can run very fast and they are more discreet.</div>
