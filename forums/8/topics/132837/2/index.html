They clean up after our shedded dead skins. They don't suck blood.  The only problem is that too much of them can cause allergy and other respiratory problems.<br><br>Bed bug are different. The word bed bug is a misnomer because they don't infest only the bed but also other areas.  Because they are commonly found on bed, hence 'bed bug'. Once saw one on a bus between the top of the seat lining. I quickly came down the bus. It is not just bed they infest.<br><br>Gone to the net and did some checking. It seems like bed bugs originated from trees where they feed on the blood of bird,  bat and other animals. So when they infest the home of human, they are usually found in dark and wooden areas. So the word 'bloody wood bug' would seem more appropriate.</div>

So don't blame me if cannot work.<br><br>Bed bugs are not something that appear from the sky. I talked to older people and from reading up.

They can. Can your perfume kill them? How to when our sweat excite them. Smelly exicites them, good smell can kill meh? Where's the logic?<br>Air dehumidifier? They can last for months without sucking your blood. So what a dehumidifier going to do to them? Kill them? I'm not convince. Hybernate them? maybe.

            <div class='col-md body'>The bugs are hard to kill and eggs even harder... It was a every weekend process that I had to keep disinfecting/cleaning and killing. That's why it took me 6 months and after that my wood furniture was really gonner and everything stink. BTW the baby bed bugs are transparent .. but you can see then when they are engorged with your blood..They are quite greedy... When they are shedding, they are easy to kill as their bodies are soft. When it harden and grow into adult.. it take a lot of strength to kill them cause their shell is very hard.. so that's why its between chemical warfare or heat that will ultimately kill the bugs. Short of burning down your house to kill them all...<br><br>I think I killed everything on that mattress,  but I was too paranoid to use it anymore... So in the end, I slept on the floor most of the time...<br>I bought a new mattress but still I am very paranoid cause, my infestation then was so bad, I remeber getting up every morning and having big red bites all over my legs, and arms. And the itch is terrible and it was so painful the bites that for many months, the pain would be so intense I would wake up suddenly from sleep, sit up and start scratching away. Its so itchy I cannot sleep after that... and I tot why my bed is dirty.. I dusted it, sunned it, wash my sheets weekly in clorox but all didn't help (I am described as a clean freak)... the bugs lived on and on... Nothing helped until months down the road, my brother discovered the bugs in his room and the amount of bug shit was so thick you cannot imagine... I was so angry at him and everyone in the house. No one bother to help eradicate the bugs. Everyone did their room and hope the issue go to someone's room. No one clean the living room cause it was also infested. I had to clean my dad's bed cause he cannot be bothered. Everything, even the chairs, sofa, the electrical casing everywhere .. there's bugs. Was so tired from the bites and yet still have to go take care of everyone's bug problems and no one helped me with my room or in the common areas.<br><br>So my mattress got ironed at high heat to kill the bugs and their eggs. I cannot pour hot water on the mattress t.. So I pressed the iron down hard on the mattress when I lift up, I can feel the mosaic floor also quite hot but my mattress lifespan also shorten like that.. .  After that I sprayed insecticide at the edges of the bed and mattress and on all wood furniture, behind the cardboards, book shelves, chairs, under anything, behind everything. Paranoid! Close the door and go out for couple of hours. Let the bugs die!!!!  If you ask me, till now. I am still very paranoid even of my current bed, pillow and bolsters.<br>Yeah, can use kerosene but can you live with the smell? Nowadays its hard to get kerosene. M'sia has bug killer powder but you need to smuggle it from there. As I write this, my hair still stand and I am scratching all over...from the memory...<br><br>But when I move out on my own couple of years back. My current rented place, I killed a big bed bug the other day when It was crawling on the floor. It was hungry, and when I killed it, brown blood in its belly squash onto my floor mat. But in my room, the floor is dark wood, and I found that wood hides a lot of bugs. I cannot see most of them and can only hope for the best. I do spray my room down with insecticide every now and then - so you can imagine the amount of money I spend on bug killers. I do have an bed bug infestation. So I sprayed insecticide my bed but I will want to do more.  I am doing my further studies so my exams are only over in June. I estimate by then, the bed bugs will come back.. I am sure and they can really live quite long so its a long drawn war. Anyways, at my rented place, the tenant I kicks out introduced mosquito infestation for me months back when she moved out. I had to clean up after another person again ... That took me also 3 months and everyday get up with 101 bites.  That was another story I posted when someone asked about mosquito some time back...<br><br>yeah bed bugs exists longer than we do and proably after we all become dust. But still I want my night of good peaceful sleep. Worse case scenario... I can sleep in my living room if I have to ...<br>So good luck!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>boiled hot water and 'cooked' all my furniture (did it in the corridore.. see them all drop out from the places I can't reach - satisfaction!) but in the end, sprayed insectide on the furniture until everything has a permanent insecticide smell.</blockquote>You seems to be doing things the hard way. If it works for you fine,  I all behind your effort. Instead of using boilng water on furniture, why not brush with (not kerosene) but (not sure about spelling) methylated spirit - no smell and its is powerful like acid but not acid and not much adverse effect on furniture. Go to hardware shop and you can find them.<br><br>Be careful of using too much spray inseticide. First, too much spraying can cause harm to your health (don't trust the label too much). Second, spray inseticide unless specified for bed bug are usually meant for mosquitos and croach. You can spray and spray but they may not kill them.<br><br><blockquote>Yeah, can use kerosene but can you live with the smell? Nowadays its hard to get kerosene. M'sia has bug killer powder but you need to smuggle it from there.</blockquote>If you use kerosene or methylated spirit, paint your furniture in the morning. Go out, come back only at night. The smell will be ok by then.<br><br><blockquote>Next I ironed my pillows, blosters, mattress and whatever I can iron to kill the bugs and the eggs.</blockquote>If severe, buy commercial bed bug disinfectant. Check The Straits Times Classified under pest control. You can buy 1 litre or more and brush you house with it. The trick is to look out for their nest. These bugs have community of nests.<br></div>
