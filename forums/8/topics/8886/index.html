            <div class='col-md body'>Dearest naive,<br><br>Well, it is well known that popularity and capabilities, not to mention beauty as well, attracts the green eye from everywhere. I do not know about the jealousy that kitty attracts due to her beauty but I suspect, with strong evidence, that the cause of all this unwanted attention is her attitude and the image she projected. Suffice to say her image is one that turns quite a few guys off.<br><br>I hazard a guess that the REAL hello kitty is not the version that the forumites are so used to seeing here. And why not, she seems to get a kick out of all those furore created over her. Which brings me to you dearest naive...<br><br>You have no idea how many rumours and innuendoes there are about you. That you are a vain little girl who prize herself on her looks solely and that the only guys with black card are worthy of wooing you. Is it true? Or is it just malicious rumours? I for one tend to think the better of you...simply because my tongue believed in your tongue.<br><br>cheerio<br>james<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by NaiveGirl:</div><div class="quote_body">well...well...what have we here...<br><br>I can only laugh at the culprit here...<br><br>kitty...<br><br>you shld be happy that people even have you in their mind.

            <div class='col-md body'>james~<br><br>Funny you should mention about me here.  But I am very interested in discussing this topic also.<br><br>You see...I am pretty fed up with all the rumors and gossips about me.  For heaven's sake! I am in the United States, never met anyone here except for tet and errie.  And look at all these on-going rumors and gossips about me.  What can I do to stop people of saying things about me?!  I can't, but I have found a way to control it now.<br><br>You see the image I have portrayed here recently?!  The vain little girl that seeks for money and attention?  It's all within my plan.  Before I was very shock and hurt when I heard nasty rumors about me that are untrue.  It even got to a point where I was so fed up with it that I thought about leaving this place.  But, not now...now I can control what people say about me.  All I have to do is portray a image of being vain, seeking for attention and money.  Now, I will only hear rumors about myself regarding these topics.  I will no longer be surprise, but will be expecting it...<br><br>I have went through two phases of image in this forum.  I went through the phase of being a nice little girl and a bitchy vain one.  During both phases, rumors and gossips were always there.  Never can i escape from it.  Did i seek for it?  Do I deserve it? What did I do wrong?!  I have no idea, but I know for sure that if I portray a false image of myself here I can always read and listen to the rumors and gossips with a pinch of salt.<br><br>Maybe it's just a way for me to protect myself from this harsh world and nasty behaviors of humans.<br><br>I do want to thank you for believing in me.  And of coz thanks to all my close friends here that understands me and know me for who I am besides of the nasty rumors they heard.  And for those that choose to think of me differently then the hell with you and must I warn you not to judge a person too swiftly...<br><br>------------------<br>Float like a butterfly...Sting like a bee...</div>

But I am very interested in discussing this topic also.<br><br>You see...I am pretty fed up with all the rumors and gossips about me.  For heaven's sake! I am in the United States, never met anyone here except for tet and errie.  And look at all these on-going rumors and gossips about me.  What can I do to stop people of saying things about me?!  I can't, but I have found a way to control it now.<br><br>You see the image I have portrayed here recently?!  The vain little girl that seeks for money and attention?  It's all within my plan.  Before I was very shock and hurt when I heard nasty rumors about me that are untrue.  It even got to a point where I was so fed up with it that I thought about leaving this place.  But, not now...now I can control what people say about me.  All I have to do is portray a image of being vain, seeking for attention and money.  Now, I will only hear rumors about myself regarding these topics.  I will no longer be surprise, but will be expecting it...<br><br>I have went through two phases of image in this forum.  I went through the phase of being a nice little girl and a bitchy vain one.  During both phases, rumors and gossips were always there.  Never can i escape from it.  Did i seek for it?  Do I deserve it? What did I do wrong?!  I have no idea, but I know for sure that if I portray a false image of myself here I can always read and listen to the rumors and gossips with a pinch of salt.<br><br>Maybe it's just a way for me to protect myself from this harsh world and nasty behaviors of humans.<br><br>I do want to thank you for believing in me.  And of coz thanks to all my close friends here that understands me and know me for who I am besides of the nasty rumors they heard.  And for those that choose to think of me differently then the hell with you and must I warn you not to judge a person too swiftly...<br></div></blockquote>What rumor??????
