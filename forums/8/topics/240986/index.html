            <div class='col-md body'>Hi there,<br><br>Earlier this evening when I was at Pearl's Centre located at Chinatown, I came across a shop dealing with mobile phones. The shop name only displayed M1 exclusive distributor. The unit no is #01-20 which is located just opposite the lift. At first, I asked them to show me a Nokia model phone. I was told of the price and I told them let me consider.<br><br>A while later, I went back to the shop and asked whether I could test the phone first before I make any decisions! To my horror, when I said I need to consider more, they get very impatient and started to say sarcastic remarks. They said that if I need to go to the ATM machine to get cash, they can accompany me and they even offert to get my atm card and withdraw on my behalf. I was astonished!<br><br>How come nowadays that shops stoop to this in order to get transactions?! The sales staff are really rude and it really put me off! I wanted to post this to a higher level hoping to highlight this event.<br><br>I believe that no matter which customers, they have every right in making decisions without anyone interfering! They behave like rogues salesman! If a customer feels that the model is not to his liking, the shop can't pester and make nasty remarks! He think that everyone is like a fool where he can intimidate! The next morning, I will be going down to the shop and ask for the boss! Hope that they can give me a satisfying answer!</div>
