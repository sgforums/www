            <div class='col-md body'>Top Polytechnic/University Ranking<br><br>Ranking criteria for polytechnics &amp; universities in Singapore are based on a 3 month survey on hundred over industry employers preferences. Institutions are not ranked by research intensivity, because unlike a world university ranking done by Shanghai Jiaotong University, academia in polytechnics and universities in Singapore have yet to win any Nobel Prizes, and it is technically difficult to obtain comparable data. Although the ranking is not necessary a good guide to the prestige of institutions, the study does show a correlation between prestige and ranking.<br><br><br><br>1ST	: SINGAPORE POLYTECHNIC     (SP)<br>2ND	: NGEE ANN POLYTECHNIC	(NP)<br>3RD 	: TEMASEK POLYTECHNIC	(TP)<br>4TH 	: NANYANG POLYTECHNIC	(NYP)<br>5TH 	: REPUBLIC POLYTECHNIC	(RP)<br><br><br><br>1ST	: NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF SINGAPORE		(NUS)<br>2ND	: NANYANG TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY                (NTU)<br>3RD 	: SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT UNIVERSITY		(SMU)<br><br>Ranking criteria for universities in Australia are based on prestige, student demand, research grants &amp; research intensivity in the good universities guide, research outcome in the SJU world university ranking report, &amp; professional recognition of degree awards by respective professional bodies in Singapore.<br><br><br>(Not in ranking order) *Australia States<br><br>*New South Wales	-	UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY (SYDNEY)<br>*New South Wales	-	UNIVERSITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES (UNSW)<br>*Queensland	-	UNIVERSITY OF QUEENSLAND (QUEENSLAND)<br>*Victoria		-	UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE (MELBOURNE)<br>*Western Australia	-	UNIVERSITY OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA (UWA)<br><br>NB:<br><br>RP &amp; SMU are relatively new institutions whose students have not been assessed by respective employers. The inconclusive data largely explain their lower ranking. We will get a better picture on how these two institutions stand in 2 to 3 years time. Any ranking are bound to be controversial &amp; that includes mine. Any prospective students should be aware that the ranking might produce a list of top institutions, but this does not mean that these institutions have what the students requires over all area of studies. Many of the Australians universities have reputations in various areas that are far better than the reputations that the 5 elite universities have for those particular areas. Examples are RMIT architectural studies and La Trobe nursing course.  For local institutions, long established polytechnic like SP are traditionally strong in Biotechnology/Chemical Process, Engineering &amp; Business Administration but lag behind newer polys like NYP in areas like Software or Multimedia design. Other examples include NP Horticultural studies or TP Legal studies. The 5 Australian Universities are the elite institutions in each of their own states, the Ivy league of Australia, all from the prestigious Group of Eight and scored highly in all the important criteria. Most important of all, all the professional degrees awarded by the 5 elite universities are recognized by the respective bodies in Singapore. That includes Accountancy, Dentistry, Law, Medicine, Pharmacy &amp; Engineering professional degrees. Another university worth mentioning is the Australian National University (ANU). Although highly ranked by the SJU World Ranking Report, ANU is not ranked in the top 5 because this ranking takes into account all the various important factors (prestige, student demand, research grants, research intensivity &amp; recognition of degrees), unlike SJU ranking which is highly focused on research outcome. ANU scored very highly in SJU ranking largely because they hold the most no. of research institutions &amp; therefore the most no. of prominent researchers. In fact, ANU was initially set up primarily as a national research institution, never a teaching university. They are more of a research, technological university compared to the 5 comprehensive universities ranked above. They do not have Pharmacy, Dentistry or Medicine teaching faculty. ANU engineering degrees are also NOT recognized by the Singapore Engineers Board. Nevertheless, ANU is a very good research university, only lagging behind other universities in terms of teaching criteria &amp; international student demand which they are aware of and fast improving.<br><br>Coming soon (Survey results ready by late December)...<br>Ranking of Private Institutions in Singapore i.e. SIM, MDIS, Informatics etc...<br></div>
