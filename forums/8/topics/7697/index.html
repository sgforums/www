            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The philosophy of Betting.</strong><br>From:akhilEUS<br><br>Hi guys,<br><br>been reading the posts, voyeur that I am and have finally decided to post something close to my heart tonite. It's entitled "The perils of betting".<br><br>Indeed, betting, be it on your garden varitey 4D, ToTo,etc... to something more "dangerous", ie your soccer betting, etc, carries with it bucketfulls of peril; but this, of course only extents to your moolah. If you're reading the 4D numbers from your Singtel pager at 7.30pm on Sundays and Thursdays, checking on the latest French Open matches that you've betted on, what's the peril to you?? NonE!! The most that we experience are the sinking moments, when the clock ticks inexorably towards the 90th minute mark and your team is still a goal down and GAWDAMNIT, eighty minutes ago you've been reading ALL the reviews that says XXX team will win!; or conversely it's moment of elation when you realize that "your" team is unbeatable, it's commanding such a massive lead that victory is virtually guaranteed...ups and downs, punters experience both, but it is only the ones that are on their streaks who will feel the most anguish or the most joy.<br><br>Like it or hate it, betting is a peril, not only to your Moolah, but to your physical well-being. It is also undoubtably a nuisance to your loved ones, especially those that do not advocate this social ill...<br><br>okay, enuff of being Freud and writing GP, as any reasonably intelligent person can tell by now, i'm a disgruntled punter who lately, has been having an unlucky streak, thus my question is "Do you think that it never rains, but it pours??" What do you guys think, shared experiences?? Closely related to this of course, is religion, i don't think any orthodox religions out there advocate this thing called luck, but instead destiny, the divine will is propagated. we are taught or told that everything happens for a reason and somewhere up there, someone is watching over us. What do you think??<br><br>From:Gazy<br><br>What the hell is moolah?<br><br>From:akhiLEUS<br><br>moolah means money, sorry for being vague....<br><br>From:the 5th bull<br><br>Gambling is a no-no for me. The odds of the game is constructed such that on average in the long run, the player loses. Especially 4D. Maybe for horse-racing, and football matches, you can do some research to minimise mistakes.<br><br>You talked about religion. In Buddhism, there is no divine will, nor anybody looking out for you up there. You're on your own.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Nothing happens due to chance, but also not due to any divine plan either.<br><br>So in the case of gambling, if you win, you might consider yourself blessed and if you lose, you think things are going against you. But if you think neither in terms of events working for or against you, then the rolling of the dice is just that, rolling.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>At last....something close to my heart!<br><br>Gambling can be a skill trade....but only bestowed to rare few....something which I discovered during my foray with the horses and the chips....hahaha.<br><br>I did came out with a thread sometimes back..entitled "No Casino but a World Class Turf Club"...but not many takers. Was it that society shunned upon those who gambles?<br>Now that our authorities have decided to open another 50 betting outlets, it shows the hypocrisy towards gambling of the society as a whole...isn't it?<br><br>Life is a gamble..whichever way you look at it. From the day you were born to the day you struggled to catch your last breathe....you are taking a risk...that's some form of bet *wink* Let me briefly explain. When you were born....your parents is your betting chips. Will they give comfort and love to you...it is a risk..isn't it? The reports of new-born being dicarded in the toilet, rubbish dump..etc, are all sign of betting gone wrong. Same goes to the abused and orphaned.<br>Likewise..will the child grew up and live to an old ripe age. That's still something he has to bet on, like crossing the road, taking a plane and the like. Should he lived to an 80 year old man...there are still risk or bet he has to take, like how to combat illness, so that he could live another day.<br><br>We cannot denied that most of us are mediocres. If we don' take a bet in any form of legalised gambling and depended on the wages we took home each month, we can't stretched our bank account. Stockmarkets and properties are indirect venues for betting too. The term "investment" was just a 'sweet sounding name'to cover-up what the 'investor' has in mind. Many of those 'burnt investors' were substiantiate to my claims.<br><br>Legalised gambling taken with moderation (like a hobby/pastime) can be healthy. But, sad to say...that was not always the case. It just prove my claims that gambling can be a  skill trade...but only to a few. The chinese saying "Ten bet, nine losses" holds true. Self-discipline and perserverance plays an important roles in gambling. Usually, it is easier say than done. Most of them could not get over the 'obstacle' called "Greed". It is in us Man that we want more. And the more we want, the deeper we fall into the pit of obsession. That's what gave gambling a bad reputation...hahaha. Other than that, to me, gambling can keep my brain working and my pocket and bank account inflating.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Cheers!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>[This message has been edited by Tommy (edited 03 June 2000).]</div>
