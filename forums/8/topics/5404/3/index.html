            <div class='col-md body'>WWOOAA!!!! I juz read those Forums again...hmm..at least I'm kinda touched n felt that my decision to have my pics up there was right after all? <a href="http://www.singaPORN.net!" rel="nofollow">www.singaPORN.net!</a>  wahahaahhaha...Thats cute, but nah....cos u have to know that Sg is still a pretty much conservative country and if I (whoever) did it, well...all I gotta say is they had better buy a 1 way ticket to US or somewhere far. Look at the Annabelle Chong hubbabb  a yr or 2 back, personally, I too agree she has guts n such, n a whole lotta it, but I can't say the same about the sexathon thingy. Cos afterall, having sex with many diff. partners gives u higher chances to be exposed to health hazards like AIDs and STDs. The way I think, if u wanna play, play it SMART.<br>Pic taking is nuthing at all hazardous so far and if there's anything that shd hurt me n that shd be words. But i dun feel a thing anyway. Sticks n stones can break my bones but words will nvr be.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I just got off MIRC and sigh....Singaporeans.....pathetic. Apparently, some mother fucker came to my channel using my nick n started asking around for sex, saying that he/she is selling her (loletta) body.....What is this? Some kinda lame joke?<br>If u think I'm the sort u can push my head down at ur dick and ask to suck it, I'd probably yank it off with a mouthful n chew it up. N those who actually take up the 'sex' offer might most probably be left high n dry to wait for the lame poser to appear. Which of course, he won't. N all the shit n stuff gets directed back at me. Next thing I know, there's gonna be another topic on sggirls titled " Is Loletta a SLUT? She stood me up for sex"<br>I can't believe the kind of cheap thrills u guys get from it.

The msgs u post suck big time. Half the time they tell of what a big loser u are (which we already know) and the rest of the time they're nothing but ass-wipe msgs for eg "REally cute...add her voice and that laugh, and she's REALLY Attractively cute!!!:-)" etc etc. Saying it once or twice is enough to make a point but a desperate shit like you had to repeat it over and over again.....hoping real hard she'd let u into her pants eh? And u don't have to keep telling her "don't listen to what others say" cuz she has made it clear beyond a doubt that she does not give a damn about that. I suggest you give some more intelligent advices if you simply must give some. Oh and you sure look as lame as u are.<br><br>Loletta CHOSE to allow her photos to be put up on the web and by doing so, it gives the internet community the prerogative to comment freely. One does NOT have to follow suit and put his/her photo up in order to comment, contrary to what some lamebrains think (if they can even think at all).<br><br>Loletta: just out of curiousity, what made u do this?

Maybe I have no life (guess maybe I really dun at all) I'm home, bored......<br>So I ,well...play with fire, thought of having my pics r there. Cos I wanna experience 1 mth (Chief said pics hafta be a min. of 1 mth up there, so carry on puking guys)of virtual 'fame'.....the fact that I dun go out much. Stay home alot...dunno y too..other than the usual swim n going around neighbouhood areas, I seldom  hit the streets.That its juz fun that I post my pics up. Cos I'm young once, I have youth , thats y I did it. Afterall, once past my prime time...say 30 n over, I wun have the looks to look that good on the camera. N imagine a 35 yr old over Loletta being featured on sggirls. PPl will just add to the criticism that I'm some old bitch who shd go n look at herself in the mirror.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It seems pretty funny that ppl coould actually come up to me or my channel n start shouting " SHAPELESS SLUT THAT DISGRACE US GERS" or a CHEAP who does it for free ( I do it not for $ but cos I like it, that sums it all up)and then quit MIRC. I think if they have the guts to tell it to me via IRC  they shd have the guts to stay. Cowards.<br>I believe that there's a wild side in everyone of us juz that we keep it under wraps becos we're afraid of society n being looked upon as freaks. Doing the sggirls thing has nvr made me looked back since, cos maybe u can say I wanna be the one who start it 1st. Like a chineses saying goes , wo bu xia di yu shui xia di yu....singaporeans need some one to start n be a scapegoat before they think the coast's clear....treat it as I'm a willing guinea pig. Make or break. If I come to a worse end where ppl condemn me even on the streets, I'll be the Loletta Example of Not To Post Ur Pics Up On Local Sites. If I do make it (get good reviews n support), someone else will come forward. N b4 long, another, and another and another...and soon the ppl behind sggirls will be flooded with gers to feature. REAL babes to feature.<br>Indeed, b4 this......guy frds,n even my best frd all said a big NO to my actions. That I'll be getting myself into deep shit. But look, even till now, I still dare to leave my home with a clear conscience face Singapore.<br>I do not want to remove my pics on the very spot (ppl say I can save myself the extra trouble on having my face on porn material)too cos if I do that, it's like I'm admitting defeat . Like I'm saying "I give up, I want my pics down." But no, I have NOT regretted it since. It'll stay, n it'll stay as long as Chief wants em down (abt a mth from now).<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I quote EcK, "If you dun like what he posts, then dun read them! Dun come here and post spastic and iresponsible comments here."<br><br>In the first place Eck, I wouldn't know what firewire said is spastic UNTIL i have read it. WOW yah hor?? U learn something new everyday eh? Next, what you post on the forum is for all to read and to comment on and debate over. Can't take criticisms? Take a hike then. Another point, while I think what u said is dumb and therefore shall not take it seriously, I thought at least if there's anyone who will take that advice, it should be your own stupid self. So here goes "Don't like what I type? Then don't read it then!". heehee by the way...you really need to brush up on ur pathetic english.<br><br>Firewire: Sure i can put things in a nicer way but well, I just don't want to. Sorry the truth hurts so much. And u wanna talk about constructive comments? Hah just look at how many grovelling asswipe compliments u dished out to Loletta. Not one nor two or even three...wow they sure are constructive eh? You said "but it is a case of hypocrisy to say things and not have the balls to bak them up.That's why so many people state that people should post their pictures if they aren't happy with what Loletta did". Alright so these people said Loletta ain't cute etc....and what do u mean by back their comments? It is a subjective thing we are talking about here so what do u mean by back their comments? DUH! Use some brains please. So u think by posting their own pics it's "backing their comments"? haha sad. It's just like part of the lives of movie stars go public when they become movie stars. It is part of the package and these people are subject to all criticisms and comments from everyone else. So all of us have the rights to comment as we like.  WHY should we post our pics first before we can comment? DUH! This is just an analogy firewire so don't try to act too smart by coming back to tell me "but Loletta isn't a movie star what".<br><br>Oh yeah u were right about me flaming the people who argued that people ought to post their own pics first before commenting on Loletta's photos. U like repeating things and stating the obvious eh? I guess u prob get the feeling u are very smart when u do this. heh... and by the way, that was a pathetic attempt to get people on ur side against me. Loser....<br><br>wow wonder who's gonna be the next girl to be featured on the site.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Kaiser : One point, while I agree what pple post on the forum is to be debated on, what you are doing is launching a personal attack on firewire derived from the opinions that u have on firewire made from his postings. And have you read all his other postings? I would assume not.<br><br>I certainly can take criticisms on the posts made by me... but not criticisms made ON me based on the posts I made. And besides like you said, the point of a forum is for pple to post their views and to debate over them and not to criticise others.<br><br>And BTW, how would you know my english is pathetic? Based on the posts I made on the forum? But anyway, happy posting and happy reading.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Why?

            <div class='col-md body'>i agree with kaiser in the sense tt loletta shld be prepared for criticisms and insults when she agreed to be featured. and she did. she knew what wld happen and decided tt she cld deal with it, gd for her! and yes, ppl have a right to comment, we have a right to criticise.. hey, the whole freedom of speech eh? but, as another person, as someone else who wld experience the same pain and emotions as loletta, we shld spare a thought for her. yeah, you're allowed to comment, nothg wrong mah. but what's the pt? what do you get by "expressing your opinion"? do you gain anythg? do you feel especially "shuang" after declaring your views for all to see on the forum? does it make you feel better? i certainly hope not. all it does is hurt someone else. ok, if you really NEED to voice your opinions go ahead, but we asking you as another PERSON, to spare a thought for a girl who was brave enough to do this and was willing to bear all the consequences to do what she wants. if you cant even do this, i really wonder what kind of person you are.<br><br>------------------<br>I believe in the sun, even when it is not shining.<br>I believe in love, even when i do not feel it.<br>I believe in God, even when He is silent.</div>
