Come on, why of all gers choose her!? kinda look fat to me... Is it that the bathroom pics turns all on?? Or is it her personality? This site is getting "serious" har?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ahem. firstly, i object to the phrase "sort of using her body to sell". yeah, many agree tt she isnt PRETTY, but has anyone denied tt she's ATTRACTIVE? she may not be a claudia schiffer lookalike, but she's attractive in her own way, like most sgrean gers out there are. you may obj to the show of flesh, and thk it's obscene/crude/pandering to males' baser "needs" but... can you imagine how she wld feel upon reading this? spare a thought for her, it reqs alot of courage, guts and self-confidence to allow someone to take fotos of you to put on the net for all to see. if you wanna obj, obj abt her poses... maybe the photographers shldnt have had so many cleavage/"upskirt" shots?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>personally, the order for me is: attractive, pretty, gorgeous. these "ranks" are all based on looks alone, while "sexy" is an attitude in itself.sexiness isnt just a gd bod, it's the way you talk, walk and move, it's all abt self-confidence. a girl can be built like 36-24-34 but if she walks like a duck, eats like a pig and has the grace of a... *ahem, any clumsy animal you can thk of* i seriously doubt tt guys wld still find her sexy? but, you can be totally flat, skinny, with no "figure" at all, but if you ooozzeeeeee self-confidence (like julia stilles!!!!!) then you're sexy!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> see, in the end it's still all abt your personality. it'll shine thru.. it's a fact tt if a person totally "sucks", no matter how beautiful she is, her beauty wld dim with time. but if a girl is sweet and kind, she'll grow prettier in the day. in the end, it's useless to be proud of your looks. firstly, you did NOTHG for them. if anyone shld be proud, it's your parents and ancestors who handed down the gd genes. secondly, they'll fade in a blink of the eye. and fifty yrs down the rd, everyone will look the same, who cares how gorgeous you were before?</div>

There are so many different ways that a girl or guy can look good or be beautiful...Thats' why I think that Singaporean girls are so pretty...they care about presenting themselves and the care shows in many different ways...and almost everyone of those different ways of looking beatiful or presentable is ...well, for lack of a better word...beautiful...There's very few people I would ever consider ugly or unatractive.<br><br>To my standards...Loletta is...(I'm still spitting up blood...while moving my head left and right in an arc)....REally cute...add her voice and that laugh, and she's REALLY Attractively cute!!!:-)<br><br>Ha ha...I hope it makes sense...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah so its me the gal on the Feature of sggirls Loletta speaking. I saw those mean comment u guys had on me. Oh well, like i care. B4 doing this i noe i'll have good n bad reviews but i also noe im the kind of ger who dun a give a fuck abt what ppl thinks of me. Cos u can never pls the world, n what u need is a few frds who stand by u n believe in u. I dare say it took me sometime b4 saying YES to be featured. And 4 for your info, fellas, I'm not the only one. Chief told me he got other requests too. So what dya think. I dun care if i go down to Orchard  n having ppl point at me whispering behind my back whatsoever cos as long as I dun do porn I'm fine. N if anyone were to try to cut n paste my face on some porn material, well..i have to say its not me. The only thing different btw me on sggirls n me on my own homepage is that the former is more publicized. Juz like Macdonalds and LongJohn, 1 is all market hype, the other is nil. N I make it a point not to do porn stuff so u won't see much but what u see in the current sggirls homepage. Hey, its my face u tokking here...I still have a future n I'm gona stay in Singapore n not run of to US or something. So go ahead n talk/gossip/slain/suan/hate me all u want. Cos it won't hurt me with any words or comment. N those of u who commented meanly on me, I rspect ur decision. Afterall, everyone has an entitlement.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One things for sure abt the girl that was featured and that is she sux! No offence but to me shes not pretty, cute or attractive or whatsoever. Shes just someone that is gutsy enough to do the photoshoot or that the admin ppl here cant find anybody else to do it. =Ã¾<br><br>Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. So some of u may think she "attractive" while some of us may beg to differ.<br><br>I do find it funny when u guys talk abt personality and stuffs in here cause the purpose of this site is to showcase "beautiful" looking ppl and not ppl with beautiful personality!

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys,<br>I'm quite surprised to see some male surfers critisizing Loletta.. I don't find Loletta offensive in the personal profile she had on <a href="http://www.sggirls.com" rel="nofollow">www.sggirls.com</a>  nor do I find her "act cute act virgin whatever.." .. I must admit she's got a sweet voice, a positive mind and the courage to show herself on <a href="http://www.sggirls.com" rel="nofollow">www.sggirls.com</a>  with sexy shots of her (no porn). Miss Loletta sacrificed (I mean her time and effort) herself without getting any rewards in return and definitely she doesn't deserve all those unnecessary and selfish and offensive remarks. Even if you really feel negative on these, could you please just illustrate your opinions in a more friendly and matured way so as not to offend anyone which may be concerned? Thank you.<br><br></div>
