            <div class='col-md body'>Mai kaopei everyone......this is getting too messy. True to Ataraxia's comments, this is the freedom of speech. N I'm fully aware that I will be getting +ve and -ve comments too. Then y u think it took me 1 whole bloody month b4 I agreed to be featured. I make sure I dun regret my decisions.<br>However, I dun like the fact that I have been getting BLACKMAIL and THREATS in MIRC about my pictures. Thats's too outta cyberworld. It spills into my real life n thats not supposed to be. Anyway, oh well....like I give a fuck.<br>And I heard from a frd that someone in IRC apparently did the Adobe PORNO on my pic already. Naked pics of my face on some porno materials are being circulated. One last time : I DUN DO PORN N NVR WILL. The bathtub pics was not supposed to show my tits n all...its supposed to be me covered in foam. For those puking now, u can be rest assured u will be spared the sight cos the bathtub shots will not be carried out anymore. Shooting's cancelled due to some (not personal) problems.<br>Hey, Life Is Still Cool. Take It Easy!!!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yes, his comment about getting pictures from the temp folder of ur browser is correct...in fact u can get it from most browsers temp folder...When u view images, it automatically gets stored in your browsers temp folder...This is to facilitate faster viewing just in case u decide to come back to the same web page...less wait time because the page and content is actually on ur hard disk already...  It should be true for any system..i could be wrong....<br><br>Especially if ur using a server (which they are), people can very easily hack into ur browser and enter ur comp from there...from as far as I know...limited knowledge of this subject really...I could be wrong...but servers use huge amounts of cache to store recent and frewquently used information(PC's usually have between 512 Kb memory cache and the rest depends on how big ur harddisk is..Servers can have anywhere from a few megabites to gigabytes of chache...)...so if a guy were persistent enough, he could find things just from ur memory cache...I believ they ahve a program out there that can do this...<br><br>If u people(general surfers) really want to be safe, turn off ur cookies, delete them from ur browser folders and hard disk, turn off/disable ur Java and JavaScript from ur browser......hackers and certain sites can use the information stored inside ur computer to gain access to it if they are good...or they can get useful info from u without u knowing...Also java andd Script is especially dangerous to use if u know hackers are after u as they can program the scripts to make ur browser do things or act/react certain ways...A good java programmer can basically take control of ur browser if he can get his script into ur browser.....or if u enter his website with that maliscious script...<br><br>The bad thing is that most sites are no fun surfing without cookies and java as u have to reenter ur user info again and again..ur cookie does that automatically for u...and java script and Java can be a great surfing experience...it can bring life to a staic surfing experience....:-)<br><br>Loletta, if ur really worried about getting hacked, u could go and try to get some protection software from the net...altho sometimes they are just viruses posing as protextion software...if u have no idea about this kind of thing, alternatively i could go and try to find it for u...leave a message here...if i ask u to mail me, i'm sure people will say I'm trying to get into ur pants...so just leave a message here...<br><br>I do know and have come across a few hackers who fight others maliscious hackers and they have come up with programs that deal with specific problems ...even some dealing with IRC hacking and how to protect against it.....Unfortunately i don't have the links anymore after my harddisk got wiped out from that stupid Taiwanese virus in April 23 or something like that...(remember that worldwide viruse created by the taiwanese?...)...It wiped away 6 gigs of porn and personal things from my harddisk...shit man..so angry about that....but I digress here...<br><br>i hope that my little essay here isn't too uninformed and uncorrect...I kno it's boring, but it might have some value to it...<br><br>Live long and Prosper...:-) Y<br><br>[This message has been edited by firewire (edited 26-11-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hiya, it's been a long while since i last posted a message. well just thought i'd share some thoughts of mine.<br>firstly, loletta i've got nothing against you ,you look like a nice person although some pics scream trying-too-hard but i applaud you for your guts and openmindedness. however, i noticed that you mentioned that adobe-fake-porno thing thrice, as if you wanted it to happen. and you use too much shorthand for my tastes, it got really irritating after a while. AND most importantly of all, what's the point of replacing 'fuck' with 'f***'? it reeks of conditioned pc-mindedness attempting to shock/express anger etc. are you from mass media like that sarah look? cos that show is godawful, such cheap sets and fifth-rate acting, only the big-haired girl was ok, although i think she's shite too.</div>
