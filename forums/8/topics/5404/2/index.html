            <div class='col-md body'>Thanx Money&amp;Power. I'm not pissed if ppl were to comment on me, but i'm pissed if ppl thinks im a fat slut or bitch whatsoever without knowing me 1st. 1 thing I wanna state: I'm not doing it for GUYS, I DUN NEED GUYS cos i think there's more to juz having a relationship. It's more for the taste of how is it like....nuthign much of the exposure, so dun bother me with sex deals and modelling contracts if u see this . The fact that I'm always home n dead bored (hence IRC) n that since I dun go out much, ppl can't recognise me, thats y i thought of being featured there. For fun....thats all I can say. Anyway, this Loletta Hoohaa thingy will die off in no time. B4 I said YES to the Chief, I knew what I am in for n till now, I dare say I still have no regrets. N I noe too that I'll be getting hate mails. Hey, this is FUN!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You r welcome Loletta.<br><br>I am glad that you are still not regretting for featuring for this site.  Honestly, I think you are great looking (very cute when u smile), and you have done a gret job in the photo shoots (look very natural).  So I have no ideas what's on those people mind.<br><br>Could this probably explain why there are more single Sg males out there from what I heard? Is it just rumors? I hope I am not generalizing. From their comments about Loletta, I got the impression that they are unrealistically looking for some super georgous girls out there.  I can only say nice dreamin for those who trying to look out for some super georgous babes.  They should probably look at the mirror before judging others.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If any of u wanna noe MORE truth, its gotta be from me cos I met the Chief n I noe whats going on. To be truthful, the Chief did indeed wanted to sell my pics but I told him NO. Cos in the very 1st place, I did not promise u guys any babes or model wannabes. Look at it this way,for a typical sg guy, if u pay for soemthing u expect A REAL GORGEOUS BABE. So I noe I'm not. N moslty likely Ibe shitted upon as a real, real ultra ugly pig. Or maybe, 1 person will buy, then he go send n dcc ard those pics......whichever I dun like it cos I"M NOT FOR SALE.  N i dun relish the fact that ppl would point fingers at me on the street n coming up to me telling me " Miss, u look familiar...are u on sggirls?"<br>So much for being a new-age 'hip' new culture singaporeans. If u can't accept the fact that a local ger in full clothed is on a local website, then i got nuthing to say about those contradictions.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i thk there's basically a lot of dif interpretations for beauty. some judge it solely by physical appearance, others judge the whole person. i prefer the latter... honestly, guys, pls do keep your opinions to yourself, in tt, if you dont have anythg gd to say, dont say anythg. it reqs guts and immense selfconfidence to do what she did, who are you to criticise? yes, she may not be "slim", yeah, maybe she isnt "chio".. but hey, look who's talking? honestly, are you guys tt handsome? tt gdlooking? if not... ahem. i wld advise you to keep quiet, go look into the mirror, and reflect on how you've hurt someone. what do you get out of it? look at the pics, admire her looks if you like her, admire her courage if you dont. whatever you do, just keep your smartass remarks to yourself.<br><br>[This message has been edited by ataraxia (edited 23-11-1999).]</div>

I admire her courage to put her pics up on SGGIRLS, able to handle gossips etc...U guys ( some ) instead of giving her encouraging words...u all instead give FUCKING Bad Mean Comments, And That Sucks!!! Toltally....I somtimes wonder y do ppl give this kind of comments, is it becoz' she has a great bod. and ur jealous or jus that she has become "FAMOUS" u gotta start some fucking rumours! No Matter What Happens, I will always Admire her Courage And i will support her, IF( !!!! ) you wanna give any crude remarks, PLS ( X the power of infinty )<br>think a second time..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe she might not exacty be supermodel material or anything, but she seems to be a nice person...vulnerable self-defense and all. It is not something everyone would want to do...show themselves to lecherous Singaporean guys and to a certain extent...lecherous Malaysian guys like me. But it's really good that she was sporting enough to pose for the shoot...I mean some of the pics show like...75% of her cleavage. It still remains innocent in a way...she isn't posing suggestively or anything, but does it in a cute, lollitaesque sort of way. Kudos, Loletta, or whatever your real name is.</div>
