            <div class='col-md body'>The basement of Lucky Plaza shops all the same one... Never buy Hp &amp; Games set from there. Some of the games shop are under the same bosses also... This place is a gathering for cheats to open shop. They are not honest in the way they do business... Cheating foreigners, locals... Their basic trick is to quote a low price for an item then when you decided to buy, they will want to collect money first... Then after that, they will let you know what is not inside...<br><br>Once my bro wanted to buy the N70 when it first came out not too long... Singtel selling about $700+ w/o plan liao. One shop near the Mac quoted my bro $690 only... Then my bro called me and told me my hp only $690 at LP so he thought of buying one for himself too... I asked him, are u sure or not? he said yeah, the man is just next to him... then i asked him to check with the salesman everything included? then he asked the salesman next to him the guy told him the price does not include the MMC card, the Battary &amp; the Headphone.<br><br>He said wtf... price for Hp &amp; box only? He told the guy he spent so much time there and the joker never once bring up a thing about this? Then he asked the joker what can he do with a Hp w/o battary and MMC card boy... The joker told him... Some of our customers don't want these items so we are providing them a better deal without these item... hahahaha...<br><br>Just for ur info, the extra items would have cost another $100+ so the total will end up $800+.<br><br>Lucky Plaza is a bad place to get anything, games &amp; hps especially... the only good thing there is the Nasi Lemak... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
