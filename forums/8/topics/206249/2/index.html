            <div class='col-md body'>About two months back my old friend from Brunei came over and wanted to buy handphone, I told him to wait until i source first and dont do anything rash...<br><br>Next thing he told me, he placed a deposit with one of the shops in Lucky Plaza, guess the address the name card of the guy who gave it to my friend? '#B1-79, Lucky Plaza'. But we bought it at the third floor. Initials of the name I can provide, but dunno if you guys think I should just disclose in public or not.<br><br>Anyway, he told me he already placed deposit and cannot take back the money cos the guy give all sorts of excuses not to.. So I next day no choice had to go down with him as I know what the sales guys are up to.<br><br>True enuff, the phone (SE W900i) set the guy gave to my friend has no ear piece and charger. they say sold seperately. Guys here using this phone before will know how the box set looks like right. I myself is a previous owner, so I told them if local set, better include the charger and ear piece cos the box clearly have made spaces for these two items...I said something like getting fine if you dont want to include, I will try to call Sony Gallery at Wisma Atria and check with them: this because the sales guy kept insisting that this is local set and really didnt come with this lah that lah.... he even took out the Installation CD!!!<br><br>I did make a big fuss over there cos I remember there were two african couples looking around to see what's going on. In the end I made them agree on giving us a real local set the next day: meaning local set with the SECURITY SEAL UNOPENED. If not wrong after my friend took the phone, I did go ahead with email complains to Small Claims Tribunal and Sony Singapore.<br><br>My advise is, cheap things are never always the best, always read or ask for the FINE PRINTS hidden somewhere!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is what my colleague have gone through<br><br>Lucky Plaza is notorious for these kinds of cheating incidents and practices.  A friend of mine was cheated into buying an older model digital camera the guy knew nothing about cameras and was tricked into thinking it was the latest model.  Its latest model equivalent was selling for less than what he paid for in Lucky Plaza for the older model and this was at Best Denki retail price!  If you do your research you can get it cheaper somewhere else, as Best or Harvey Norman usually sells at list price.<br><br>Another friend of mine from Belgium bought a video cam there.  I told him to wait for me, but he was eager to buy something immediately as it was his first time in Singapore.  When I met up with him he told me that he bought this video camera and I asked him where? He said Lucky Plaza and I shook my head and asked him why didnÂ’t he wait for me so I can take him shopping.  I later brought him to MustaffaÂ’s and we found out that the same thing he bought cost $700 less!<br><br>I highly recommend everyone not to buy anything from that place, most of the people there are cheats and they are waiting for an ignorant victim to come by.  Best thing to do is to research at Best Denki or Harvey Norman to get the list price then go start sourcing, but never at Lucky Plaza.  If you think you are smart knowing the list price, and try to compare they will offer you cheap, but then sell you the items without default components like minus the battery, charger, flash card and all and say that these are add onÂ’s, and that you them have to Â“buyÂ” these items individually.  In the end they con you with the difference so you are not actually getting a better dealÂ…<br><br>If you are looking for camera stuff go only to Cathay Photo at Peninsula Plaza.  There are a lot of camera shops there usually run by Â“Ah BengsÂ” very shady operations just go past them and get your stuff directly at Cathay.  The staff there are knowledgeable and you usually get very competitive prices there.  Not necessary the cheapest, but very competitive<br></div>
