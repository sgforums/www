Hence we need more headcount from China to ensure a higher chinese percentage to maintain the status quo. Besides,  our lousy highly educated snuff nosed local women, can't produce nuts since they are not willing to spread their legs with any tom, dick and harry or have multiple relationships with any men. Maybe our goal after all these 40 years is to outpace Bang-kok with a BIGGER and BETTER BANG!
