How about CPF, and all those government funds and supports meant for only Singaporeans? My Korean neighbour's son was studying in an elite sec school here. I would not mention it here. But you can guess.<br><br>For Singaporeans the fee is 200 a month. 500 for foreigners. Yet, those Singaporeans who got into the school are all good enough to get the scholarship from MOE. Thus every month they only pay $35. Foreigners is just a straight $500.</div>
