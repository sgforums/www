            <div class='col-md body'>Have you seen this before?<br><br>60 signs you've been in Singapore too long<br><br>1. You know that "cum" means something completely different from what you originally thought.<br><br>2. You've lost your sense of irony, sarcasm, and cynicism.<br><br>3. You don't know what's lame and what isn't anymore.<br><br>4. You think there's nothing wrong with putting chili sauce on everything you eat.<br><br>5. You wait for instructions from people in authority before doing anything. Always.<br><br>6. You join queues without knowing or caring what the queue is for.<br><br>7. You know what "queue" means!!<br><br>8. You can type an SMS on your phone as quickly as you would if you had a regular keyboard.<br><br>9. Your idea of a good night out consists of having dinner at a hawker centre, drinking beer, and then going to another hawker centre and eating again.<br><br>10. You've lost your ability to criticize people in higher positions than you, even if they're wrong.<br><br>11. You would buy a $20 product you don't need if it's on sale for $10 just to save the money.<br><br>12. You forget to say the last consonant in words like "faCT", "aTE",etc.<br><br>13. You think it's okay to have only one meaningful choice on a ballot.<br><br>14. Every task you take on and every group you form is incomplete without a mission statement and a cheesy slogan.<br><br>15. You think that in a country where young people have little privacy, pornography is completely banned, music and movies are censored, students of the opposite sex in a dorm can't stay in the same room without open doors, and everyone works so much, that people should still want to get laid.<br><br>16. "Crossing the country" means taking the MRT to the end of the line.<br><br>17. You don't just know what "kiasu" means, you have become it!<br><br>18. You think that corn and beans are dessert foods.<br><br>19. You would cross the entire country all day to find the places that make the perfect fried noodles, or roti prata, or ice kacang, or chili crab. And none of these places would be close to each other.<br><br>20. You have a high tolerance for nagging.<br><br>21. Most or all of these acronyms make sense to you: NUS; NTU; ERP; SDU; PAP; MRT; LKY; GCT; PRC; TIBS; SBS; SMS; JB; JBJ; AMK; AYE; PIE; ECP; ISD; ISA; 5 C's; CPF; CHIJMES; SPG; CWO.<br><br>22. You use too many acronyms when you talk, or you create new ones.<br><br>23. You think that nothing makes a girl or guy more attractive than to dress exactly like hundreds of thousands of other girls and guys who all dress exactly like girls and guys in malls.<br><br>24. You think that $100,000 is a reasonable price for a Toyota Corolla and $1,000,000 is a reasonable price for a bungalow, but $5 for a plate of fried noodles is a barbarous outrage.<br><br>25. You believe that not being able to get decent roti prata outside Singapore is enough to keep the best and the brightest people from leaving.<br><br>26. You see nothing wrong with forming committees of select elite people to deliberate and study ways to stimulate creativity and spontaneity.<br><br>27. You justify every argument with the phrase "in order for us to be competitive in the 21st century".<br><br>28. You think everything should be "topped up".<br><br>29. You have a naive belief that the war against ants will somehow be won.<br><br>30. You don't think any dish of Western food is complete without baked beans.<br><br>31. You see nothing unusual about an organization of trade unions spending more time owning and operating supermarkets, drugstores, amusement parks, nightclubs, and financial services outlets than planning the next strike.<br><br>32. You believe that a lack of land is enough justification for the goverment to do what it wants.<br><br>33. You wear winter clothes indoors and summer clothes outdoors.<br><br>34. Durian and belachan no longer stink to you.<br><br>35. You like to have fun, but not too much fun, since you need to correctly gauge the amount of fun necessary to achieve the optimal result. Any more fun that that would bring shame to your family and your country.<br><br>36. Seven french fries with lunch are more than enough for you.<br><br>37. You forgot what a city organized around a grid looks like.<br><br>38. In a country where people use smart cards for public transit, you have no problem with construction workers riding in the open backs of pickup trucks.<br><br>39. You think paying $50 for a bottle of booze that costs $15 at home is a bargain.<br><br>40. You're not confused by a street naming system that locates streets like Clementi Road, Clementi Street, Clementi Crescent, Clementi Lane, Clementi Drive, Clementi Way, and Clementi Avenues 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 all within walking distance of each other.<br><br>41. You think that skinny girls and guys are the most attractive of all. (How did they get so skinny in the first place?? Do you know how much oil is in nasi lemak, char kuay teow, duck rice, and your average curry??--ed.)<br><br>42. You get irritated if you don't see a sign telling you how long your wait's going to be for a bus, a train, or the expressway to take you where you want to go.<br><br>43. You're certain that Holland Village is for hippie bohemian artist types and not overpaid yuppies.<br><br>44. When you cross the border into Malaysia, you automatically and deeply fear for your life and your wallet. Especially your wallet!!<br><br>45. You think that no vegetable should ever be eaten raw for any reason. Except for cucumbers.<br><br>46. No matter what you're doing at the moment, you'd rather be shopping.<br><br>47. No matter how miserable you may be here, you thank God you're not in Indonesia.<br><br>48. You're impressed by high-rise apartment buildings with actual lobbies instead of bare exposed pillars on the ground floor.<br><br>49. You don't have a problem with four different direct payment systems spread out over seven different cards in your wallet.<br><br>50. You forgot what chewing gum tastes like.<br><br>51. You say "handphone", not "cellphone" And you think there's no such thing as a handphone that's too thin.<br><br>52. You're not bothered by the fact that government cares whether you know how to use a toilet or urinal correctly. (People squatting on toilet bowls? What the...???--ed.)<br><br>53. You're sure that the best way to change social behaviour is through consistent and comprehensive government-sponsored campaigns that permeate as many aspects of daily life as possible. And when they don't work, you never speak of them again.<br><br>54. You think chicken floss, corn, mayonnaise, and tandoori spices are proper pizza toppings.<br><br>55. You agree that what the government thinks of your personal habits and lifestyle should determine whether you get a condo and how much you pay for it.<br><br>56. You've become a fan of either Arsenal, Man. U., or Liverpool when you barely knew what soccer was before you came to Singapore. And you don't care that none of these teams are Singaporean!<br><br>57. You think a bus is incomplete without a TV.<br><br>58. You accept that expressways here are cleaner than toilets rather than the other way around.<br><br>59. You know why this list needs the following disclaimer:<br>"This list is intended only as an amusing, light-hearted, and exaggerated look at life in Singapore and is not meant to be taken seriously. There is no intention on the part of the author of this list to make any untrue, misleading, or defamatory statements concerning any person in particular, nor to make any statement intended to cause offense.

            <div class='col-md body'>Unlike other overseas chinese who will quickly become rich and prosperous through common entrepreneuring traits found in chinese migrants, you became a wimp. You could only sit in the comfort of your armchair complaining and whining about your country, about your government, your job and about your quality of life.<br><br>You are as materialistic as an ethic chinese would be, but you have lost your ability to achieve your goals. You have lost your fighting spirits. As a result, you will live a life constantly trodden, trampled and manipulated.<br><br>I sold laksa for 15 years. At the foodcourt, I kowtow to the shop owner. He rented me my store, charged $1500 a month. At the end of the month, my profits amounted to less than 20% of my turnover. But I could only complain. At home, I wash the clothes, mop the floor and gives spelling to my son while my wife watches TV. But I could only whine over beer. I drove a car I knew was too expensive. I lived in a resale flat I knew was over-priced. But I could only whine. My wife lost her job to an indian national who couldn't do as much as her. She too could only whine.<br><br>Don't laugh at me, because you too, are like me. You are an ethic chinese migrant  who have lost your soul.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">PART TWO</span></strong><br><br><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">&gt;1. Thanks to SMS, you have an extra large thumb.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;2. Tks 2 SMS, u oso dun no how 2 spel n e mor.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;3. You pat MRT and bus seats to cool them before you<br>&gt;sit down.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;4. At lunch, you start discussing what to eat for<br>&gt;dinner.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;5. Your wedding photos include shots of you dressed up<br>&gt;like Louis XIV, Michael Jackson, or Leonardo DiCaprio<br>&gt;and Kate Winslet in Titanic.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;6. When speaking to foreigners, you somehow feel a<br>&gt;need to adopt an accent. (If you're a DJ, this happens<br>&gt;even when you're not speaking to foreigners.)<br>&gt;<br>&gt;7. You won't raise your voice to protest policies, but<br>&gt;you'll raise your fists to whack someone over Hello<br>&gt;Kitty.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;8. You're forever talking about businesses you want to<br>&gt;set up but will probably never get around to starting.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;9. You don't know Â¾ of the people attending your<br>&gt;wedding.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;10. You separate food into 2 basic groups: 'heaty' and 'cooling'.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;11. You're never completely sure how many times you've<br>&gt;sung the second verse of the National Anthem.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;12. You think that what makes you 'married' is not the<br>&gt;legal registration but whether you've thrown a 12<br>&gt;course dinner.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;13. You marry for the real estate breaks.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;14. You have kids for the tax advantages.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;15. You move to where you want your child to go to<br>&gt;school.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;16. You feel you can't walk around naked in your own<br>&gt;flat.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;17. You force your children to take Speech &amp; Drama<br>&gt;classes, but pray they won't wind up in Arts later on.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;18. You suddenly realize you're very interested in<br>&gt;biotech - just like you suddenly realized three years<br>&gt;ago that you were very interested in e-commerce, and<br>&gt;before that, engineering, and before that, medicine<br>&gt;and law.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;19. You think being an entrepreneur is setting up a<br>&gt;bubble tea/Portuguese egg tart/gao luck/porridge shop<br>&gt;right next to an existing bubble tea/Portuguese egg<br>&gt;tart/gao luck/porridge shop.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;20. You think people are inconsiderate when they don't<br>&gt;leave their table immediately after eating at the food<br>&gt;court but think you have every right to take 25 bites<br>&gt;to finish the last red bean in your ice kachang.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;21. You find it impossible to make suggestions without<br>&gt;drawing a fishbone chart first.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;22. If you're a guy, whenever you get together with<br>&gt;your guy friends, you invariably trade army stories.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;23. If you're a girl, whenever you get together with<br>&gt;your girl friends, you invariably trade stories about<br>&gt;how your stupid guy friends are forever trading army<br>&gt;stories.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;24. You think the most important sporting event in<br>&gt;Singapore this year was David Beckham switching from<br>&gt;Manchester United to Real Madrid.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;25. You somehow feel that food tastes better when<br>&gt;eaten by a longkang.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;26. It actually makes a difference to you being called<br>&gt;an 'NSMan' rather than a 'Reservist'.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;27. You've eaten more times at the Esplanade than<br>&gt;you've actually seen shows there.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;28. You need campaigns to tell you how to be<br>&gt;courteous, to flush toilets, have sex, etc.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;29. When you visit the Zoo, you wonder what the<br>&gt;animals taste like.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;30. You feel the urge to add the suffix '-polis' to<br>&gt;everything, viz. Biopolis, Airtropolis, Fusionopolis, Entrepolis,<br>&gt;etc.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;31. You always feel oddly hungry at 11 pm, and are<br>&gt;willing to drive to far away places for supper.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;32. You meet in hotels a lot.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;33. Your children have a rudimentary knowledge of<br>&gt;Tagalog or Bahasa Indonesia.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;34. You work at McDonald's when you're old rather than<br>&gt;young.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;35. You'll gladly spend $50,000 on a car, but will go<br>&gt;to great lengths to save a few bucks on ERP charges or<br>&gt;even a few cents on a parking coupon.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;36. Pork floss and mayonnaise on bread is a completely<br>&gt;natural combination to you.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;37. If you're pregnant, you have the strange ability<br>&gt;to make people on the MRT fall asleep instantly.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;38. You ask for the bill by miming a signing movement.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;39. You've started referring to foreign employees as<br>&gt;'talent' instead of 'expatriates'.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;40. At the dinner table, you're always discussing<br>&gt;which other food places serve better versions of what<br>&gt;you're eating.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;41. You copy down licence plate numbers of cars<br>&gt;involved in accidents.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;42. You think your boyfriend doesn't really love you<br>&gt;unless he gives you part of his liver.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;43. During sales, you book hotel rooms near malls to<br>&gt;enable you to shop more efficiently.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;44. You pronounce the letter 'R' as 'ah-rer' and the<br>&gt;letter 'H' as 'haytch'.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;45. No matter how old you are, you keep associating<br>&gt;people with their secondary schools. (alternative: No<br>&gt;matter how old you are, you secretly need to know what<br>&gt;other people got for their PSLE, O levels and A<br>&gt;levels.)<br>&gt;<br>&gt;46. You're always on a quest for the definitive<br>&gt;version of your favourite local dish.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;47. When you explain things to people, you keep (a)<br>&gt;using alphabets, and (b) speaking in point form.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;48. You believe that you can generate 'creativity'<br>&gt;through rules and committees.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;49. You 'chope' a seat by placing a packet of tissues<br>&gt;on the chair.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;50. You're very forthright with your criticisms of the<br>&gt;Gahmen, unless there's a chance they might actually<br>&gt;hear you.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;51. You diligently track the whereabouts of your<br>&gt;favourite hawkers, i.e..you know that the famous Tiong<br>&gt;Bahru Bao is now in Jurong, the famous Outram Char<br>&gt;Kuay Teow is now in Hong Lim Centre and the famous Lau<br>&gt;Hock Kien Hokkien mee from the old Lau Pa Sat is now<br>&gt;at Beach Road.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;52. Your mother probably can't speak your 'mother<br>&gt;tongue'.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;53. You'd rather drink your own pee than pay someone<br>&gt;more for water.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;54. You secretly find that the best part of the Speak<br>&gt;Good English Movement is hearing the Singlish bits in<br>&gt;their ads.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;55. You have an automatic sensor in your head which<br>&gt;categorizes people you meet into stayer/ quitter,<br>&gt;cosmopolitan/heartlander, normal/ express/ gifted, etc.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;56. You think we're living in a modern, sophisticated<br>&gt;country even when our leaders still insist on wearing<br>&gt;their school uniforms.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;57. You wish your constituency is in a walkover,<br>&gt;because otherwise it's damn 'leceh'.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;58. During elections, you decide that there is no<br>&gt;credible opposition even though you don't know the<br>&gt;name of the opposition candidate in your constituency.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;59. You think having a constitution is like the<br>&gt;condition you get when you don't eat enough fibre.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;60. You can never quite remember what "the core<br>&gt;values" of Singaporeans are."</span></strong></div>
