            <div class='col-md body'>Recently, I brought my Samsung phone down to one of their shops. I requested for a firmware upgrade. Before this, I had tried to upgrade the firmware by myself, but caused all the data on the phone to be lost and no text could be displayed on the lcd screen.<br><br>And guess what, when I got my phone back, switched it on, noticed the firmware was still the same. So, I decided to confirm it by pressing *#1234# and I got the shock of my life when I saw the same old firmware version as when I first purchased my phone. I was furious but refused to question their customer service staff further.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Now, I am wondering what the hell the technician did to my phone. From the looks of it, he simply re-flashed the same old firmware version back into the phone. Besides that, I also discovered that he used Bluetooth to transfer two files into my phone.<br>1) Samsung Spanish Guitar mp3 test file.<br>2) M1's "We're 10" wallpaper.<br>I deleted the two files mentioned above.<br><br>And guess what is written on the invoice?<br>Defect Descr: No display on lcd, aw data loss.<br>Repair Descr: resolder filter &amp; upgrade s/w. z240dzgd4 - a9<br><br>Nothing about my phone's firmware has been changed one bit, and I'm thinking of lodging a formal complaint with the management.<br><br>I press *#1234# and it shows:<br>SW VERSION<br>Z240DZGD4<br><br>That's the old firmware version which was on my phone when I first purchased it from the M1 Shop. And the technician just simply re-flashes it back into the phone and calls it an upgrade?<br><br>I find it absolutely ridiculous. Here's a picture of what's on the invoice:<br><br><a href="http://img138.imageshack.us/img138/6138/photo0003qt5.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img138.imageshack.us/img138/6138/photo0003qt5.jpg</a><br><br>It's simple.  Take for example, when you install a new version of firefox on your computer, you are upgrading it to a new version, don't tell me you install a new version, let's say 2.0.0.7, and after installing it, you open firefox again and click on Help---&gt;About Firefox.<br>Out comes the dialog box and writes the version 2.0.0.6, which was the old one.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I wonder what your reaction would be.</div>

Now I don't find that fair and honest, because you are wasting your customer's time and energy, running to and from his house and the service centre/shop. And that strength and energy is being wasted just to have a handphone serviced. Properly.<br><br>2.- Why would they write the word upgrade s/w in the first place? Obviously it's saying that the technician will upgrade the phone's firmware. I do have information that there are firmware upgrades available for this phone, and I will kindly request one more time that it be done properly, or else I won't let them off.<br><br>3.- Perhaps you would like to read again what's on the invoice, if you can't read it, I have it all typed out clearly for you to see.
