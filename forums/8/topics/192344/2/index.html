Bad Parents. </div></blockquote>Yup, I agree too.<br><br>It seems that while students are generally financially well supported, they lacked guidance and emotional support from parents. Easy to go stray, don't know what's right, what's wrong and they are more likely to look for friends for comfort.<br><br>Parents on the other hand agrue that they don't have time for their kids as they have to mantain the finance stability (their favourite agrument). I think as a result (which is the main prob), many parents pushed the responsibility of moral education and teaching their kids to the schools. I also heard some parents see schools as child care centres, irrespective whether is is primary, secondary or even jcs.</div>

What's conducive to one is not a conducive to another. Everybody is born different, don't expect solutions that work for 90% of the people to work for the other 10%.<br><br>13. Will they know what's self-discipline at such a young age? Education is just purely education. Moral values and ethics are all up to the kids - whether they want to learn or not. That's when adults come into play in their life. They have to teach them what's acceptable and what's not. Kids are vulnerable, they learn from what they see. If adults don't set a good example, it will only affect the next generation.</div>
