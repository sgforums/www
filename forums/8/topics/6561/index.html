            <div class='col-md body'>in my opinion, we should be given the chance to make our own mistakes and learn from them, and not be spoonfed by our parents. i mean, most of the times, they'll tell us what we should do, that we should do this, not do that. but sometimes, more often than not, (in my case), things that they ask us not to do, we would be itching to do it, while things they ask us to do, we would try to avoid getting it done.<br><br>ok, so maybe life is too short to make so many mistakes, but wouldn't the lesson learnt be more valuable if you learnt it from your own mistakes, than learning it frm other people's personal experiences? undeniably, you do learn something from there, but more often than not, you'll learn something more if you've made the mistake yourself, won't u?<br><br>well, just looking for what you people think. =) please do give your comments. thnx!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I am a person who is really DESPERATE for advices from my seniors, pple who are more experienced than me.<br><br>I like to listen to their stories, what they did and when they had learned. I think the advices they give are real SHORTCUTS in life. They advice me all the roads which i should avoid and how to take the shortest route to my desired destination so that no time is wasted and i can move ahead of my peers.<br><br>Well, yes, somethings you have to learn yourself and you always learn more when you make your own mistakes. But like wat you said, we dun have time to make too many mistakes, and i see no necessity to make mistakes which can well be avoided.<br><br>Advices are advices. We should only take them as advices and not orders. They are only references when we are making decisions. The mistake most parents make when giving advices is their incorrect attitude. When we give advices we must "talk at their level" and not as someone "higher". We must give face to the person too when giving advices, dun say "aiya, you dunno lah, you too young lah, listen to me lah  ... blah blah blah", the advice will definitely not be heed.<br><br>And dun listen to advices from just one person. And when someone provide advices for free, LISTEN. I won't say parents are always right with the advices they give, but i am very sure that their intention is good. And for that reason, I think we should listen to them patiently and seriously. Heed or not is another question.<br><br>This is my 5 cents worth.</div>

However I hate it when they attempt to impose their views on me and force me to do their bidding esp parents. I want to have the choice of evaluating all the advice I get and choose the path that I feel is more suitable for me. Everyone is different and no one single advice suits everybody.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think its good that you parents are concerned enough to give you their opinions. Personally, there are somethings which I would definitely love to see for myself whether it was a right decision. But parents being what they are, would want to give their opinions also.<br><br>Some people are definitely lucky enough to have parents who are happy just to advise and let them make their own decisions.<br><br>I think your ability to make decisions change as you grow older and more seasoned, so decisions that you made when you were younger will seem dumb later on. But its hard to see that when you are at that stage. So there are times when you need advice as well.<br><br>I think there some things that you really need to try for yourself, whatever everyone tells you, parents or otherwise, even if you fall during that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My parents are pretty liberal, though they tend to give subtle nudges when they want be to do something that they think is good for me..... like the JC i go to or something. Thenwe usually have a talk where they say why they want me to go to that particular JC, and why I want to go to another one. It's a give and take basis lor. So I'm not complaining. I guess the whole relationship is based on trust. So far, I dun think I've betrayed their trust, and I hope I never will!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think whatever your parents do, they only have good intentions. though sometimes they tend to go over the limit.  :p<br><br>also, it really depends on your age. if you are still young and green, naturally your parents just want to protect you from making mistakes. being inexperience, mistakes hurt. it's a double-edged sword. it can kill, it can build. what your parents do is kind of a natural thing.<br><br>of course as you grow older, you don't want to cling onto them and behave like some mama's son or daddy's girl. maturity comes with responsibilty. when you are done drinking milk, you proceed with solid food. sometimes you choke, but you learn how not to. in the olden days when breast-feeding is the norm in the absence of milk powder. mothers wean their babies. they put something bitter on their nipples so that the baby will detest drinking milk. then the mother can start feeding them solid food. it's the same thing with life.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
