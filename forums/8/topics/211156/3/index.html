There is a defence against defamation if you make it clear you were just expressing an opinion rather than saying it was true but that defence is not usually accepted in Singapore. Guess SPH's defence will be on the grounds of public interest but that defence can and has been defeated before as well in similar circumstances when it involved opposition party members.<br><br>I think they will settle out of court. The wives of judges and Ministers, not to mention journalists will ensure that is so....</div>

Reason? I don't know what's their intention for writing such an article.<br><br>The use of such words, is not merely an escape clause for the journalists. It's at the very least, responsible journalism. If something could be true or untrue, the word "allegedly" is used. It's used most commonly in reporting crimes, if a person is being suspected, but no confirmations yet. For example, Mr X allegedly stole something. He may or may not have stolen anything. Everything will be confirmed once investigations are completed. If the newspapers wrote Mr X stole something when he's only a suspect, the man do have a right to sue him, because it is deemed as a fact.<br><br>Same goes for this case, SPH could be trying to encourage a debate on it, but have stirred up the wrong emotions instead.<br><br>I definitely don't support the use of such words as a way to escape responsibility, since its main purpose is about responsible writing...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with SPH... Sometimes I really wonder why parents want to send their daughters to single sex schools... What is wrong with having boys around? Especially primary school where all are just kids! Growing up without proper interaction with boys may have some side effects... The same goes for boys who have been in single sex schools.... when these people go to JC and they start to mix around with frens of the opposite sex, things start to go wild... and this is how the "IJ girls are easy with guys" mentality came about....<br><br>The point is: The more parents want to restraint their kids from mixing around with the opposite sex, the more things will go wrong when they grow up...</div>
