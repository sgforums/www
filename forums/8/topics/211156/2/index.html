Y the hanging outside school with grp of boys?<br><br>Since when i was in sec sch, which was 13 yrs back, IJ girls have given an impression to me that either they are very easy to hook up or they are probably les. it has been the IJ tradition for all these yrs. Come on man, if those board of comittee doesn't want their sch to be given such names, then they would probably have to really start educating their girls to becoming nuns.<br><br>i wouldn't say all of the IJ girls are like this but at least 70% of them are like what was being described in the papers.</div></blockquote>See? That's generalisation. Exactly what the nuns and alumni are unhappy about.<br><br>Based on one person's impression, a subjective and slanted overview has been developed and, like heresay without offending those unassociated with such actions, will spread like wildfire in a dry bush.<br><br>It's always easy to stereotype a single individual and paint the whole institution as such.<br><br>But's its also wrong, especially if the aim is simply to sensationalise a story without proper facts.<br><br></div>
