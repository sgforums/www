When someone makes a statement which somewhat projects an individual in a negative light, his immediate reflex action would be to challenge those claims in order to maintain his own dignity. Better-learned pockets will provide the same old universal sure-fire rebuttal " You should not generalise. What you said is not entirely true."<br><br>What I feel is that the reason why countries like Singapore, China and Malaysia will never catch up with the current giants is that very negative mentality we have. Our immediate reflex towards conflict should be one of reflectual analysis rather than hostile rejection. Upon criticism we should immediately access the areas where it is justified, rather than splitting the ends and finding all ways to discredit the claims. In this case, I think that whoever wants to defend the IJ girls should first wonder why such things are said of IJ girls and not of the other girls schools. There are more than 20 girls schools in Singapore and if IJ girls have been singled out for this behavior by more than an individual then there must have been a very good reason.<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

And you mean all the mixed school girls don't fold up their skirts? Hey, i had even seen them unbottoning their shirts all the way to the upper second button... How Conservative... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> And how about those dyed hairs, wearing make up to schools and flaunting their coloured bras under white blouses? Can i say they are there to seduce the guys?<br><br>Oh then you would say not all your girls are like that right? There are really nice and decent ones, of course i believe you, coz we have nice people in ours too!<br><br>And ahem, who are the ones with better results? It's so true that girls school girls can play hard and study hard at the same time, some even excel in sports too. And the drop out rates in mixed schools are so much higher. And by the way, even when we make noise, we use PROPER ENGLISH.<br><br>We do mix with the boys' school guys. (Hey, at least we go for those better quality ones than the mixed sch bengs okay?) Call us easy, but you know what? Some guys can only LOOK, and we don't even know they exist. Then they start calling us names like stuck up and loose. How loose are we when they don't even have access to our toenails?<br><br>And when we meet up with the guys, we do study together, and here I mean really study, not sit at Burger King to kiss and touch thighs. And oh, of coz not all are angellic in our schools as well.<br><br>So...<br><br>If you want to call us loose, look at your own schools too. There are black sheeps everywhere. So don't sterotype. It's not fair, you get it, People?<br><br></div>

Sometimes I really wonder why parents want to send their daughters to single sex schools... What is wrong with having boys around? Especially primary school where all are just kids! Growing up without proper interaction with boys may have some side effects...
