Rumours don't just come for fun. They come because of some misintrepretation or perception from some members of the public towards certain facts. Thus, in my opinion, clarification is needed as I have mentioned earlier.</div>

Does he know each &amp; everyone of the IJ students ?<br><br>i describe his definition of the convent girls as a really rude and inaccurate way of defining us &amp; i even feel a tinge of sadness for his ability to see us in that light for he is too blinded by the truth &amp; MY definition of a saddistic person is just him/her -the person who wrote that article.<br><br>&amp; a note to that person, for his motive is clear- to tarnish IJ  schools reputation.<br>You did not succeed because IJ girls has very much proven to the EYES of the public that we are not even close to that definition of yours but instead a bunch of respectable ladies who has come far in life.<br><br></div>

We are all different and thats what makes the world interesting . You can`t know what kind of character a person has by just seeing them for less than a day in a bus ride . and so similarly, you cant assume that all IJ girls are like that . Furthermore, this has nothing to do with IJ girls or not .Its the upbringing of their parents and the teachers in all schools i believe are also trying their best to help in the " lesbians" mindset.<br><br>and even if you say lots of lesbians comes from IJ schools....and  what you say its true then it is really a contrading statement you made to go against the report.. as it states... to the opp sex.</div>

It`s because we <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>are </strong></span> taught The many values and virtues that the other schools do not offer . and one of which is not to judge something by its cover. ok. fine maybe to you people out there we are potraying that kind of image but its not true. so to you , by becoming a nun means purity ...then may i ask if you are a nun ?<br>i get what you mean that our school will not be given such names if we were nuns but just because the media did not stereotype you people from other schools (mainly because it wld be easier to make a comment on IJ schools because there are more then just one ), that does not mean that such people do not exists in your school.</div>

Y the hanging outside school with grp of boys?<br><br>Since when i was in sec sch, which was 13 yrs back, IJ girls have given an impression to me that either they are very easy to hook up or they are probably les. it has been the IJ tradition for all these yrs.

YOU NEVER THINK WHY IS IT SHORT. you only have ONE FIXED REASON IN UR STUPID BRAINS that is becoz they want to attract guys attention ? NO LA! ur mind is so dirty. i bet you havent though of this. IJ girls are saving money to not buy a new uniform as they are in school for the last year ? so why not waste unnecessary money on buying a brand new uniform ? ur brain is really so SICK. just STOP insulting the IJ girls with your STUPID CHILDISH imaginations.
