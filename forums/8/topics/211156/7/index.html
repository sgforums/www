Defamation cases are very difficult ones.  Some of my lawyer friends don't seem to be very keen in taking up this kind of case.  In Singapore's system, it's very hard for the prosecutor to win, unless you have lotsa money.  (Defamation case is very expensive according to my friends).</div>

They score high in results. Whether in single or mixed schools, as long the will to get good grades are there and the school system is good.. there is no difference.<br><br>Your remarks smacks of Eliteism.<br><br></div></blockquote>I agree that there are some good mixed schools like Dunman High but if u checking Ranking of Sec. School u will realise that single sex sch. like Cedar Girls, Cres. Girls, SJI, IJ schools, SCGS, St Anthony, Catholic High etc are consistently found in the list.<br><br>These schools don't take in the top PSLE scorers but are able to get their students to perform well eg my kid's score was 208 but "O' level she manage to get 13 pts. enough to get her into JC.<br><br>If I'm not wrong, they are all in the top 30 sec schools in S'pore (that was before they do away with the ranking) &amp; that's why parents want to put their kids there.</div>

While on the paper it appears that they are trying to defend CHIJ's reputation, it appears to me that they just want sympathy from the public as well as promotion of CHIJ through this infamy. Perhaps what they want as the results are newfound reputation of defeating SPH, which "destroyed" NKF, and to use the incident to bond all the CHIJ girls, especially the alumni. And the increased of alumni supports is always directly linked to the donations. Just my guess.</div></blockquote>If someone insults your school, u should not keep quiet.<br><br>Also they don't need to use the publicity to generate donations.
