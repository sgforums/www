The process of sueing needs quite a substantial amount of $$$. Besides, there is a probability that IJ management may lose. The atmosphere of uncertainty is still there as SPH is a big and quite well reputated company. If IJ management loses the lawsuit, they will end up losing more $$$ and if they win the case, they can earn a bit of $$$ but most importantly, they can win back their hard earned reputation.</div>
