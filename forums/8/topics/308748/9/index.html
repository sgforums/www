              <p>bottomline whether you are willing to do something about it! Sell tissue papers can also earn something instead of doing nothing at all.</p>
              <p>many students work part time so that they can spend on your favourite stuff. you want to live better then you got to earn it and not expect handouts, and if you are fully aware of your family's condition somemore.</p>

              <p>    This tend to happen amongst young adults and also people in their mid-lives. Being there but unable to create resources to make themselves happy.

              <p>There are other people who thinks that they are smart and tramples on others too ? So, why bother ? Just needed to work for the resources that makes you happy for this, some say 85 years of lifetime?</p>

              <p>i come from poor family... both father mother is factory worker.<br><br>i rmb when i started poly, my money in my bank account almost all gone coz have to buy one stupid laptop to use. for school use, compulsory for all students. cost me almost $2k. i think. didnt wanna loan those laptop from there, coz i scared lao kwee...coz my friends will look down on me n think i m poor.... ya if u loan u sure get some old cheapo model...everybody will know its a loaned one<br><br>they didnt want to pay for me coz they r paying the school fees already...anyway the $2k came from the temp office job n some odd jobs i worked after o levels....haiz heart pain. work so hard just to buy one stupid laptop for school use.<br><br>my parents give me $150 per month as allowance. very little siah, they kan stingy. but bo bian they r poor. about $60 went to bus pass. $90 left for makan n other spendings... they pay phone bill for me thankfully..broadband also they pay.. imagine i have $90 for canteen food n other spendings...thats so little lor. thats y i cant anyhow spend... furthermore i promised myself i m gonna set aside some money every month for savings...to make up for the $2k spent on laptop<br><br>i was poor all along...everyday wear giordano/bossini/OP clothes n jeans, dont have much clothes also, while the other guys were in nice branded billabong, ripcurl, ralph lauren shirts n levi's/guess/armani jeans... i so jealous siah.... i notice girls then to stick to the more rich n intellectual guys....damn these guys hor, their clothes all branded n everytime wear diff one. n they got nice handphone n everything branded...<br><br>my clothes all wear until old n faded...couldn't afford to buy more clothes coz money tight...have to save up just in case n also keep some money in wallet to go out with friends once very now n then. but seldom go out coz i not so popular... n i m using nokia 7250...use for so many years le...while i see nowadays young people all using 3G phone like nokia n series... wah lau<br><br>then lunch time to save money i often had meals that cost $1... eg. the malay stall canteen plain fried beehoon/mee goreng only $1... so i always eat that. or i'll eat chap chye with one dish only n lots of curry sauce. drank only water cooler water or my own bottle water coz drink stall canned drinks too exp....my own water is free one.</p>
              <p>n somemore in poly always have to buy textbook so exp. siah. so i don't normally buy, sometimes borrow from friends or library n photostat a few pages...<br><br>i think my classmates could see i m poor from the way i dress n behave. haiz i feel so sad n embarassed. i think some of them secretly laugh at me behind my back or look down on me n despise me.</p>
              <p>speaking of which... when poly first started... i was mixing around with this group of pals lah... we got along well...always sit together for lecture or lunch, do projects n assignments together, study or revise work together etc... we also went out... go watch movie, kbox, eat lunch or dinner... but never go clubbing lah, coz they not clubbing type. then everytime see movie i have to cough out money of course...heart pain siah...for a 1 1/2 hour show bout $10 gone just like that. n they often like to restaurants n fastfoods... such as pepper lunch, swensens, kenny rogers, crystal jade, pizzahut, sakae sushi... n fastfood like kfc, mac. so when we eat at such restaurant, i see the menu i feel turn off, coz all so expensive. imagine how many $1 fried beehoon i can buy from the canteen in poly for that $10+ set meal. so i usually dont eat,....drink only iced water...have to give excuse say i not hungry. i feel a bit left out when the rest r eating n i m the only one not eating...what to do? if i spend like $10+ on one meal my money wont last me for the rest of the month...</p>
              <p>but i thik my friends know the truth that i cant bear to spend so much...that i m poor.</p>
              <p>then even go mac i dont eat, only eat the 60 cents ice cream. n in kfc i just order one small whipped potato. after a while, i notice my friends stopped asking me out, n i think they would discuss about outings when i m not around. maybe they think i m a loser? i m not like one of them? maybe they feel i m an embarrassment to them? coz i dont eat anything in the restaurant n maybe my clothes r cheap n faded n old n out of fashion?</p>
              <p>so i find myself drifting further from them.... they dont ask me out but i dont really care. dont go out better still, save money n i can spend time playing comp games. then during lunch time they seem to talk less to me. haiz... i feel so upset...i m losing my friends. feel more n more alone with each passing day.</p>
              <p>i cry sometimes at night in bed. i often scold my dad n blame him wasting his salary on stupid 4d/toto n cigarettes n beer.... if he dont spend on these he can give the family more comfort n give me more allowance.. waste money n harm his health too. then when i tell him off he doesnt like it n we quarrel n i feel even more depress. now i think its affecting my studies... no friends... no money...stupid parents... n my mother also... another one who spend a lot of money on 4d but yet never strike...</p>
              <p>oh ya then one time my classmate pals n i were talking...bout how much u get from parents as allowance. i realized i m the lowest lor.... this guy his dad is a rich businessman dealing in export goods...he gets $800 per month! would u believe it? wah kao.... how i wish i had a rich dad. he lives in a 3 storey terrace house n he says he dad will buy him a car after he get a license. he somehow likes to boast n my other classmates will oo n waa over it. but i find it childish....sibei hao lian siah....i dont like him tsk</p>
              <p><br>haiz feel so sad...why i m so poor....why must be born in poor family...haiz so sad my life very cham. no girlfriend also coz cant afford.,,, feel so depress n i m always jealous of those rich ah sia kias</p>

              <p><br>first of all in order to achieve anything i believe you must accepct whatever you got.like playing a game of chess although you have less solider then other people but you don't give up have a goal to checkmate the guy.</p>
              <p>Well alot of successful people millionaire come from poor families although we in singapore consider very fortunate.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so please be contented!!!if you like to compare ok like compare we to african baby who is luckier? They work hard they also will have great success what.And nowaday,furthermore people are educated and i believe success is still the same but one thing need hardwork and perservance and you have a goal/dream in mind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>write down your goals be it whatever do a search on google,yahoo for smart goals</p>

              <p>my allowance is just $50 more than you dude. And i live very happily.</p>
              <p>Just letting you know, everyone's life is the same. Just a matter of how u think.</p>
              <p>Why care about branded? To me, as long as its nice, its branded to me. I hate buying cltohes with just the brand name on the shirt and cost a bomb.</p>
              <p>Why care what others think about you? If they say you sux. does that means you sux? NO, unless u think of urself like that.</p>
              <p>The onli things that affect me which sometime i can't resist is relationship.</p>
              <p>I feel quite jealous of couples. But i tell myself i will find 1 someday.</p>
              <p>This is what i learn on my road to poly, from my ITE...</p>

              <p>Please pity the TS. He is not eating enough. He has to drink water from water cooler. To be fortunate, you should have $3 decent meal and able to buy canned drinks.</p>

              <p>I agree with many observations here that the TS doesn't know what poor is.</p>
              <p>He has $2,000 in his bank to buy a brand new notebook and he calls himself poor.</p>
              <p>Wake up lah poorkid.  Work harder to better yourself.  Count yourself lucky you weren't born to a really poor family in Rwanda.</p>

              <p>Be glad that your parents paid for your poly school fees.. Me? I had to work during holidays before poly starts and all the school fees were paid by myself alone and it's not easy. If not, I'd not have studied in poly at all. I had to pay for my daily expenses as well.</p>
              <p>If you think you are poor, then you can wait after you graduate from poly and get a proper job to earn yourself a living. No one can say you are poor then.</p>
              <p>By the way, I don't think you are poor enough.</p>
