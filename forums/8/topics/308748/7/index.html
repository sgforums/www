              <p>how come nowadays poly have to buy textbooks?during my time only need to buy photocopied notes...quite sufficient liao...the most is photocopy a few more pages from the textbooks in the library.</p>
              <p>Ah sia kias also have their own set of problems...U think they no worries one meh?</p>
              <p>I think its more of ur attitude than anything else...last time I also had a classmate who is quite poor...sometimes have to walk home one...nobody I know looked down on him lor...its just how he behaves and all that we were more interested in...rather than how much money his father has...</p>

              <p>i come from poor family... both father mother is factory
              worker.<br> <br> i rmb when i started poly, my money in my bank account almost all
              gone coz have to buy one stupid laptop to use. for school use,
              compulsory for all students. cost me almost $2k. i think. didnt
              wanna loan those laptop from there, coz i scared lao kwee...coz my
              friends will look down on me n think i m poor.... ya if u loan u
              sure get some old cheapo model...everybody will know its a loaned
              one<br> <br> they didnt want to pay for me coz they r paying the school fees
              already...anyway the $2k came from the temp office job n some odd
              jobs i worked after o levels....haiz heart pain. work so hard just
              to buy one stupid laptop for school use.<br> <br> my parents give me $150 per month as allowance. very little siah,
              they kan stingy. but bo bian they r poor. about $60 went to bus
              pass. $90 left for makan n other spendings... they pay phone bill
              for me thankfully..broadband also they pay.. imagine i have $90 for
              canteen food n other spendings...thats so little lor. thats y i
              cant anyhow spend... furthermore i promised myself i m gonna set
              aside some money every month for savings...to make up for the $2k
              spent on laptop<br> <br> i was poor all along...everyday wear giordano/bossini/OP clothes n
              jeans, dont have much clothes also, while the other guys were in
              nice branded billabong, ripcurl, ralph lauren shirts n
              levi's/guess/armani jeans... i so jealous siah.... i notice girls
              then to stick to the more rich n intellectual guys....damn these
              guys hor, their clothes all branded n everytime wear diff one. n
              they got nice handphone n everything branded...<br> <br> my clothes all wear until old n faded...couldn't afford to buy more
              clothes coz money tight...have to save up just in case n also keep
              some money in wallet to go out with friends once very now n then.
              but seldom go out coz i not so popular... n i m using nokia
              7250...use for so many years le...while i see nowadays young people
              all using 3G phone like nokia n series... wah lau<br> <br> then lunch time to save money i often had meals that cost $1... eg.
              the malay stall canteen plain fried beehoon/mee goreng only $1...
              so i always eat that. or i'll eat chap chye with one dish only n
              lots of curry sauce. drank only water cooler water or my own bottle
              water coz drink stall canned drinks too exp....my own water is free
              one.</p>
              <p>n somemore in poly always have to buy textbook so exp. siah. so
              i don't normally buy, sometimes borrow from friends or library n
              photostat a few pages...<br> <br> i think my classmates could see i m poor from the way i dress n
              behave. haiz i feel so sad n embarassed. i think some of them
              secretly laugh at me behind my back or look down on me n despise
              me.</p>
              <p>speaking of which... when poly first started... i was mixing
              around with this group of pals lah... we got along well...always
              sit together for lecture or lunch, do projects n assignments
              together, study or revise work together etc... we also went out...
              go watch movie, kbox, eat lunch or dinner... but never go clubbing
              lah, coz they not clubbing type. then everytime see movie i
              have to cough out money of course...heart pain siah...for a 1
              1/2 hour show bout $10 gone just like that. n they often like
              to restaurants n fastfoods... such as pepper lunch, swensens, kenny
              rogers, crystal jade, pizzahut, sakae sushi... n fastfood like kfc,
              mac. so when we eat at such restaurant, i see the menu i feel turn
              off, coz all so expensive. imagine how many $1 fried beehoon i
              can buy from the canteen in poly for that $10+ set meal. so i
              usually dont eat,....drink only iced water...have to give excuse
              say i not hungry. i feel a bit left out when the rest r eating n i
              m the only one not eating...what to do? if i spend like $10+ on one
              meal my money wont last me for the rest of the month...</p>
              <p>but i thik my friends know the truth that i cant bear to spend
              so much...that i m poor.</p>
              <p>then even go mac i dont eat, only eat the 60 cents ice cream. n
              in kfc i just order one small whipped potato. after a while, i
              notice my friends stopped asking me out, n i think they would
              discuss about outings when i m not around. maybe they think i m a
              loser? i m not like one of them? maybe they feel i m an
              embarrassment to them? coz i dont eat anything in the restaurant n
              maybe my clothes r cheap n faded n old n out of fashion?</p>
              <p>so i find myself drifting further from them.... they dont ask me
              out but i dont really care. dont go out better still, save money n
              i can spend time playing comp games. then during lunch time they
              seem to talk less to me. haiz... i feel so upset...i m losing my
              friends. feel more n more alone with each passing day.</p>
              <p>i cry sometimes at night in bed. i often scold my dad n blame
              him wasting his salary on stupid 4d/toto n cigarettes n beer.... if
              he dont spend on these he can give the family more comfort n give
              me more allowance.. waste money n harm his health too. then when i
              tell him off he doesnt like it n we quarrel n i feel even more
              depress. now i think its affecting my studies... no friends... no
              money...stupid parents... n my mother also... another one who spend
              a lot of money on 4d but yet never strike...</p>
              <p>oh ya then one time my classmate pals n i were talking...bout
              how much u get from parents as allowance. i realized i m the lowest
              lor.... this guy his dad is a rich businessman dealing in
              export goods...he gets $800 per month! would u believe it? wah
              kao.... how i wish i had a rich dad. he lives in a 3 storey terrace
              house n he says he dad will buy him a car after he get a license.
              he somehow likes to boast n my other classmates will oo n waa over
              it. but i find it childish....sibei hao lian siah....i dont like
              him tsk</p>
              <p><br> haiz feel so sad...why i m so poor....why must be born in poor
              family...haiz so sad my life very cham. no girlfriend also coz cant
              afford.,,, feel so depress n i m always jealous of those rich ah
