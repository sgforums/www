              ya. but pls do not blame ur parents. Given a choice, I dun tink they will choose to be poor also. Parents will always wan to provide their best for their kids.
              
              And it's no embarrassment to loan a notebook from the school. I tink u as an individual haf to accept the situation that u are in and make the best out of it. It is high time to be mature and face the facts. 
              
              I tink the best for you to break out of the poverty cycle is to study hard and get a decent job in the future. =)

              <p>most ppl who tell u not to whine never been poor before, as such
              they dunno what is the feeling of being poor.</p>
              <p>They just say say tell u not to look down on yourself, but let
              me tell you, it is 10000% vvvv difficult to NOT to look down on
              yourself when you are poor.</p>
              <p>So ppl who had not been poor before, don't crap here as if the
              TS is whinning. Poor does give u a reason to whine. Dun believe?
              Okay, leave just 10 bucks in your wallet and no ATM, nothing, try
              to survive a week on those. + no eat at home. if eat at home, can
              only eat vege + rice ONLY. i bet 90% 1 week drop dead.</p>
              <p>to TS, u have to first accept the fact u r poor. becuz u cannot
              accept that, thats why it hurts. If u accepted that, then u can or
              will able to put down your pride to accept aids. pride are
              worthless when you are poor.</p>

              <p>TS consider poor? His parents don't provide him enough to eat? They don't pay for his school fee, don't give him any allowance? They even pay for his phone bill and broadband. At least, he still get to wear giordano/bossini/OP clothes n
                                      jeans. To me, he just a ungrateful child (I wonder how he will treat his parents when he grow up). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>Refer to my previous post, my parents didn't even paid for my school fee and I have NO allowance. I wear old clothe from my relatives. But I never felt poor and is grateful that my parents as they rather borrow money from relatives to ensure that we had enough to eat.</p>
