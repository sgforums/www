              <p><br>work mah, my parents everyday sleep 6 hours to wake up in the morning to work, my parents which operate a canteen mess in 2 different army camps. that is the price for wanting to live in comfort, thats why I see now, everyone in my family, their parents' hope, my siblings' dreams all rest on me to go to university and become a U grad.</p>
              <p>and partly because, my father side, look down on my mother's side even though its not obvious because my mum's side is poor. thats why I must study hard to prove a point and make my parents proud.</p>

              u think those rich kids are actually rich themselves? its their parents cough out money give them buy branded clothes. unless those kids earn their own money and buy cars and their own clothes than ok they rich,but actually they are same like most of us. its only they got ppl feeding them money.
              
              please dont blame your parents. im sure if they can give you everything in the world,they would. im not from a rich family either. very very average family. but i can see how much my parents are trying to give me the best in everything. for this i told myself i must work hard and give them a very good life in their old age.
              
              and i will.
