I felt so sorry to hear that they're not around anymore.. This kinda sadden me.. really.. What pet owner wish for is for their pets to live healthy and live long.. I can't imagine 1 day without my Baby.. The other time she suffered from urinal prob and had to stayed at the vet there for a day.. I was damn sad, cried on and off for that day.. Really missed her so much.. And making lotsa calls to the vet to check whether she's alright.. Luckily she's well again, but have to go under low pHs diet since then.. I feel abit sorry for her cuz she has to stick to the same food and when she drools when we are eating our food.. Damn that whisxxx cat food.. This is the first time I keeping cat, that's why I didnt know that brand of food from thailand was deadly!! Heard many cats kena from that too.. That's why I rather spend alittle more to buy a proper brand of cat food for the strays.. You know they seldom get clean water to drink, if they continue the cat foods from thailand, it'll only bring the same prob to them.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>I like the bond shared between your cats.. the sibling bond..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> You know MeMe(the black female kitten above) was kinda skinny and weird looking, her mum doesn't really like her or care about her esp after she gave birth to another batch of kittens.. Fortunately, GoGo(the brown kitten), which is her brother nv leave her alone lor.. They always play together after meal.. I'd taken videos of them playing too..

Sometimes, animals, although we call them animals, they actually behave better than we humans! They show care and concern towards their siblings, nv walk them out.. Jus like the cat brother you mentioned above.. I can understand the truma within the sister cat.. She simply can't trust humans again.. Which is very sad.. She must have nv thought that her owner would disown her after so many yrs of trust builded on it.. I really feel very sad for her you know? I've seen cats who were abused by humans.. They just won't trust us easily again.. What I must say is, even my Baby, sometime when we bring her down for a walk, she'd behave rather tensed up too! Clutching on us tightly.. I guessed she's afraid that we'd abandon her like her previous owner..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Do you still keep cats btw? I think it's pretty hard to walk out from the death of your cats.. I once keep quails as pets b4, when they're gone, at night I still thought I heard chirpings.. One of my quail actually flew out and nv come back.. Everytime I always thought I heard some noises at the window that might be my quail coming back.. Now the hallucinations are gone when my Baby walks in.. And I'm quite glad about that..
