            <div class='col-md body'>I know that GW Bush is a Bone&amp;Skull Cult member of the Bohemian Club (Death n Human Sacrifice), and he talks to god.. or is that the other way round..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Anyway, trust him to be a Patron of a somewhat Nazi-like Religious rally worshipping him ...... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Some excerpt from the article......<br><br><strong>Fear and Loathing at Philadelphia's BattleCry</strong><br><br>It began with fireworks so loud and startling I screamed. Lights and smoke followed, and a few kids were pulled up on stage from the crowd. One was asked to read a letter.<br><br>This was the letter that opened the event. <strong>Its author was George W. Bush.  Yes, the president of the United States sent a letter of support, greeting</strong>, prayer and encouragement to the BattleCry event held at Wachovia Spectrum Stadium in Philadelphia on May 12. Immediately afterward, a preacher took the microphone and led the crowd in prayer. Among other things, he asked the attendees to <strong>Â“Thank God for giving us George Bush.Â” </strong><br><br><strong>On his cue, about 17,000 youths from upward of 2,000 churches across America and Canada directed their thanks heavenward in unison.</strong><br><br>Throughout the three and a half hours of BattleCryÂ’s first session, I thought of only one analogy that fit the experience: This must have been what it felt like to watch the Hitler Youth, filled with self-righteous pride, proclaim the supremacy of their beliefs and their willingness to shed blood for them.<br><br>(While in the bathroom, I saw something equally unsettling--a preteen girl wearing a shirt being sported by many attendees that night: Jesus on the cross, robes waving, and emblazoned across the front the words Â“<strong>Dressed to Kill</strong>.Â”)<br><br>The first rock band that performed, Delirious, got the crowd festive and up on their feet with lyrics that were projected on large screens so that everyone could join in: <strong>Â“WeÂ’re an army of God and weÂ’re ready to die.... LetÂ’s paint this big olÂ’ town red.... We see nothing but the blood of Jesus....Â” </strong><br><br>Luce used this critique of pew-sitting Christians to assuage the doubts of the youths at the rally who may have been feeling uncertain about their commitment to the Church. <strong>Â“DonÂ’t worry,Â” he was telling them, Â“youÂ’ve been amongst pew-sitters--watered-down Christians. Welcome to the reign of total submission to the Lord.Â” </strong><br><br><strong>Â“He doesnÂ’t just want to be in your heart, He wants to own your heart.... ThereÂ’s only one good reason to come to Christ: because HeÂ’s the rightful owner of your life.... You donÂ’t have to know much about Jesus, just enough to surrender your whole life.Â” </strong><br><br>Throughout this section, a loud crowd from the back of the stadium would periodically erupt, <strong>Â“We are warriors!Â”</strong><br><br>Luce put great emphasis on following every word in the Bible, treating it as an Â“instruction book,Â” even when a person doesnÂ’t understand or agree. This is, of course, <strong>the logic that leads to the stoning of gays, non-virgin brides, disobedient children and much moreÂ—because the Bible says so. </strong><br><br>I and about 20 people representing various anti-Bush, atheistic and anti-Iraq-war factions made our way into the rally and began interacting with the youths assembled. <strong>Some said openly that it was OK that George BushÂ’s lies have cost the lives of thousands of Americans and Iraqis. Why was it OK? Because Â“God put him [Bush] there.Â” </strong><br><br>We then decided to ask them a little about this God, and his Â“instruction book,Â” as Luce calls it. Specifically, we asked them if they supported the parts of Deuteronomy and Leviticus that spell out, for example, <strong>death sentences for women who dared to enter the city while menstruating. The most memorable response came from Luce himself. (</strong>We were standing face to face in the plazaÂ—he had recognized me from my OÂ’Reilly appearance.)<br><br>Mannn.... I thought they say Bush is a staunch Christian... why is he supporting heresy.
