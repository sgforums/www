            <div class='col-md body'>Have you ever wonder why singapore being such a small country need so much water to support itself?? 1stly, It becos of our standard of living being too high. Wastage of water is not new to you all. 2ndly, becos of our dense population. But why dense when our pple are not willing to produce?? why still so many pple around when our government is complaining and warning us of our greying population problem?? It's because of too many foreigner staying in singapore whether for work, study or to stay. That's why we need so much water. The commercial sector need lots of water, the residential sector need lots of water and the industrial sector although using recycled water need extra more too.<br><br>There's alot of reason esp political one why malaysia want to increase the price of water selling to us. When there is a demand, the price goes up. If you find the price too high, then find other alternatives or just don use too much water, simple as that. but did the government ever need to ask you guys whether it can be accepted or not signing contract with malaysia. Did the government invite you Rapture to discuss the matter? If not, don't blame others calling them god, ops i mean dog when you are just a tiny little nobody. It's their water afterall, they have the right to decide the price of it. You are not happy, you can choose not to buy. But can you choose in the first place??<br><br>Singaporeans are too use to the wasteful way of life living in comfort. And hence most of those rich folks esp those foreigner will be willing to pay the high price. I just hope the gov will not force the increase in price of water into the bill of the common people. Life is already so hard with bill piling up, economic downturn and so many retrenchment going around.</div>

Rivers nurtured every ancient civilisation: the Tigris and Euphrates in modern-day Iraq, the Nile in Egypt, the Indus in India and the Huang Ho in China.<br>Without water, life cannot exist. It is, therefore, priceless.<br><br>If water is priceless, why should Singapore complain about paying more for the water it buys? Currently, it pays three sen per 1,000 gallons. It has offered to pay 45 sen per 1,000 gallons.<br><br>But even 45 sen per 1,000 gallons does not reflect the fact that water is essential to life. If Singapore feels that paying more than 45 sen per 1,000 gallons is too costly, then it should get water from other sources Â– from Indonesia or desalination plants.<br><br>Singapore should be like Israel, a country Singaporeans admire. Singapore should be self-sufficient in water. This way, water will cease to be a canker in its bilateral ties with Malaysia and Indonesia.<br><br>SingaporeÂ’s Public Utilities Board is building a desalination plant which should come on stream in 2005. Singapore should build more desalination plants. Israel is building a desalination plant at a cost of US$150mil (RM570mil) and the water provided will be the lowest for desalinated water Â– US$0.527 per cubic metre (RM9 per 1,000 gallons).<br><br>[/B]</blockquote>This is a text taken out from the malaysian newpaper critisizing us.<br><br>see how cocky they are man!!!!!<br></div>
