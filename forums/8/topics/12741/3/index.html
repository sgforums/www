Do you know that this chapter was manipulated by bishops of the past who used christianity or power of the church to control the nation. You are simply a idiotic fool to believe everything just by reading it. Stop quoting from the bible as I am not intimidated by it!<br><br>Just to let you know, stupid christian. I am not afraid as I am conscious of my own heart and is not deceived by whatever stupid phrases you quoted from the stupid bible.<br><br>Let your god judge lah, I am not afraid. Your stupid judgement day will never come as jesus was never resurrected!<br><br>You only know how to quote phrases from your stupid bible to intimidate non-believers and think you are so great.<br>You only know how to follow your stupid bible blindly, but never have the courage to find out about it's origins and the contradications it contains. You just cannot face the truth. People like you only know how to hide behind the cruel reality and facts of life inside your bible to rid yourself for facing the ultimate truth. Thinking that you will be pure and holy by believing "him"! You simply just cannot accept the truth.<br><br>You are a pathetic fool, who like to act holy under your mindless beliefs and imaginative god! Hell is only a mindless and senseless word use by christians like you to intimidate non-believer to believe your stupid religion. The other is sin.   :p<br><br>Prove me that Adam and Eve exists lah?! Don't tell me that the bible said so. This is a stupid excuse. You have no brains! Idiotic fool!   :p<br><br>[This message has been edited by OmegaCentauri (edited 29 November 2001).]</div>
