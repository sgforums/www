            <div class='col-md body'>To those people who argue that we can't prove they don't exist we remind them of a fundamental principle of law and evidence, namely if they make the claim (that spooks exist) the burden of proof is on them, not us.<br><br>Christianity is obviously a Jewish concoction. It is a fact of history that the Jews worshipped their Books of Moses long before Christianity ever appeared on the scene and before Christianity was sold to the unsuspecting Romans. It is a fact anybody can check for themselves that the Old Testament (which comprises three quarters of the Christian bible) is all about Jews, Jews, Jews. Regarding the New Testament, nobody really knows who wrote Matthew, Mark, Luke or John, or who these<br>characters were, but it is common agreement among both Christians and Jews that Saul of Tarsus, who became the St. Paul of the<br>Christian movement, was a renegade Jew. He wrote almost half of the New Testament, the basis of the Christian creed. It is therefore a fair conclusion that Christianity as expressed by St. Paul (Saul of Tarsus) is in essence Jewish.<br><br>Christ, the proclaimed hero and founder of Christianity is repeatedly represented as Jewish. His parents, Joseph and Mary, are represented as Jewish, with the ancestry of Joseph being traced back to "the seed of David." In Luke 2:21 it tells of Christ being circumcised on the eighth day, as was the custom of the Jews.<br><br>There is no contemporary historical evidence that Christ ever existed, the above Christian claims notwithstanding. It is my conclusion that no such figure ever existed but was reconstructed from myths, allegories and fantasies arising out of earlier religions, especially the Essenes, whose connection with Christianity I have already chronicled in NATURE'S ETERNAL RELIGION in the chapter "Christ's Existence not substantiated by Historical Evidence." To me this further indicates strongly that the whole swindle is based on a lie. To those who would prove otherwise, I repeat, the burden of proof is on the party claiming. As an interesting side note, the "crucified savior" story had been used in seventeen<br>other religions before the Christians picked it up and replayed it for their con-games.<br><br>------------------<br><strong>I consider myself an Expert tomato gardener since all of my friends tell me I have the most colourful and sweetest tomatoes.<br><br>"Life is too short to bother with tasteless tomatoes."<br></strong></div>

To you the bible is your ultimate truth, and you think everything is the truth from it. So what if people act out the video of jesus christ?! Those people are christians, that why! And that only represents the so-called truth in their own simple-minded brain. Do you think non-christians will act out such stupid events?!<br><br>I am not Kyo23. And you are such a stupid idiot in guessing my identity. What am I is not important. There are many people with clear mind of what is truth and myth. But you have entrapped your mind in what you percieve as "so-called truth"!<br><br>Well, it is becos you are a greenhorn in bible and literally take it as the truth by just reading it and believing it. It is just like a fool who listens to whatever he reads about, just becos people proclaim to him/her that is the truth.<br><br>Do you know that for all religions, there is a common origin? Christianity is not the oldest religion. It is not meant to be a religion at all. It's people doings.<br><br>Well, we will see if you "god" or DOG should return in the second coming as stated in the revelation chapter! Hope you go to your stupid heaven... hahahahah  :p<br><br>Final Words: "If you start with certainities, you will end up in doubts! But if were to start with doubts, you will end up in certainities."<br><br>Go back and read your "holy" bible, innocent fool, and induce yourself in more stupidity thinking.  :p</div>
