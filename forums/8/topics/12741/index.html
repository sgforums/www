Can you discern the myth and the truth? How you know that everything in the bible represent the truth?<br>How you know that jesus christ was really resurrected in reality?<br>Are you sure he will come back?<br><br>I guess to you, you simply just believe becos the bible said so and the pastor said so. Tell me the answer lah. But I tell you, the answer to the above question make no sense. You mind and thinking is totally encompasses by your belief.<br><br>Don't ever deny that christians don't condemn other religions. For the truth is that, they simply do. If not, the stupid bible would not have stated if you don't believe in jesus christ, you will end up in hell no matter how much good things you done. Furthermore, the bible stated don't workship idolatories. This implies that other religions are simply satanic. Or you are saying your parents or grandparents are workshipping a piece of stone(ancestor).<br><br>Anyway, that stupid figure pinned on the cross is also craved from wood or some metal. Isn't that idolatory?<br><br>Well, I did not pretend. And I don't have to. It just contains a lot of contradicting ideas that does not make sense. In order to make innocent fools, like you, to believe in all these, the pastor will insist that you must have absolute faith in everything for there is no logical truth behind the beliefs. Then the pastor will start saying, "Oh, it's god doing and it's far from what we can understand." What a crap!<br><br>I believe the true jesus never intend to make his teaching to become a religion to control people's life. It's all up to you.<br>If you get so angry for what I have said, then it's too bad that you have indirectly admitted to what I have stated to be the truth. So why get angry? You are just being ignorant. Never look at things at the surface!<br><br>Go and pray to your stupid god for help so u can go to your stupid heaven. ahahahah   :p<br><br>[This message has been edited by OmegaCentauri (edited 28 November 2001).]</div>
