            <div class='col-md body'>My most unexpected letter would be one I received last year from one of my ex-students.  I never actually taught this young man, but I did once mark his English examination essay.  He is a very accomplished writer and I was thrilled by the standard of his writing in the examination.  Initially, I hesitated giving him a full mark, but on review, I decided that it was good enough to merit the top score.  So I amended the mark I had originally given him and promptly forgot about the whole incident.  That was about five years ago.<br><br>Out of the blues last year, I received an email from him thanking me for changing the mark on his paper.  He explained that my simple act had encouraged him so much that he had decided to become a teacher himself.  I was not a little surprised and extremely touched by what he had to say.<br><br>There is a story that is told about a man who took a walk on a beach.  There he saw another much younger man picking things up and throwing them into the sea.  On closer inspection, he saw that the young man was picking up starfish that had been marooned on the beach and returning them to the sea, one at a time.  There were hundreds, if not thousands of starfish that had been washed up on the sand.  The older man questioned the younger man's actions, since it seemed to him an impossible task to clear the beach of all the starfish.  The younger man replied that it did not matter because it made a difference for every one of the starfish that he did manage to save.<br><br>What strikes me in this story is the same thing that struck me when I received the email from my student.  It has taught me that sometimes the smallest of actions can make a huge difference in the life of others.  Ralph Waldo Emerson put it like this: "To know that one life has breathed easier because you have lived, this is to have succeeded"</div>

The younger man replied that it did not matter because it made a difference for every one of the starfish that he did manage to save.<br><br>What strikes me in this story is the same thing that struck me when I received the email from my student.  It has taught me that sometimes the smallest of actions can make a huge difference in the life of others.  Ralph Waldo Emerson put it like this: "To know that one life has breathed easier because you have lived, this is to have succeeded"</div></blockquote>heard this from my ex-principal last year and from a volunteer last week... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>

Actually I still am an English teacher - been at it for the last 14 years.<br><br>Being appreciated always feels good, whatever the vocation or occupation.  Perhaps we should all be more appreciative of the people around us so that more of us can feel better each day.  I have a suggestion on where to start - say something nice to the next carpark attendant you meet and watch his/her face light up!  Let's all go M.A.D. - let us Make A Difference in the life of someone today!</div>
