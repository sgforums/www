            <div class='col-md body'>Do you have the Blood group B+ &amp; bone marrow AB+ ? needed urgently. If so your help is needed, please see appeal letter below. If you don't have the blood type you could help by sending emails to your friends.<br><br>Name : Ng Ruiming Jeremy<br>IC No : S 8220551 I<br>Blood : B+<br>Bone marrow : AB+<br>Location : SGH<br>Tel : 97669723<br>Haematology Department of the Singapore General Hospital SGH Block 7 / Level 2 / Ward 72<br><br>My son, Jeremy, is terminally ill. He's only 19 this year. His blood count is low and it's falling fast with each passing day. Jeremy has not given up hope and he's still fighting to keep alive. But with each minute, the battle gets tougher, the journey more difficult. As a mother, it breaks my heart to see him suffering this way.<br><br>Jeremy is my only son. Like all youths, Jeremy has dreams but now, these have been rudely dashed. Each moment, as I watch his life ebbing away, a part of me dies. Without donors, the doctors can do no more for him. So today, he was discharged from hospital to await his fate. And what that is, I know yet I do not have the courage to face. Doctors say Jeremy has only between 3 and 6 months. He needs both Blood and Bone Marrow donors. For Blood donors, if you are between 17 and 45 years of age, and you belong to Blood Group B+. For Bone Marrow donors, if you belong to Blood Group AB+. I need your help. If you can find it in you to help Jeremy, please go to the (Haematology Department of the Singapore General Hospital SGH, Block 7, Level 2, Ward 72), and say that you are there for Jeremy. His full name is Ng Ruiming Jeremy. IC No: S8220551I. Jeremy wants to live on and he needs your help. Deep in me, I harbour a glimmer of hope, a hope that when you read my appeal for help you would come forward to<br>help Jeremy. If you can't be a donor, I'll understand. But could you then please forward this plea of mine to your friends? I need to reach as many people as time is running out for Jeremy. If you have any queries feel free to call me at 97669723. Thank you.<br><br>Ivy Ng (Jeremy's mother)<br><br></div>
