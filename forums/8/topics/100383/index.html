            <div class='col-md body'>i am posting not to just defend neon tetra...but only he who is a true christian will know that neon tetra has not been causing shame to christianity. in addition, i find his posts filled with gentleness and the tone used are kind. the content might be edgy and might even seem controversial. but isn't this a place to discuss amiably about stuff?<br><br>why is there a need to raise our voice and start swearing?<br><br>ever wonder why after being persecuted so many times, being shouted at so many times, he still remain calm and retain his composure? if he really only loves christians, he won't have to be posting here for non-christians to hear. it is his duty as a believer of God the Almighty to proclaim the gospels(read: good news) to everyone and of coz to those he cares and wanna share the good news with.<br><br>more imptly, his etiquette in forums shld be modelled after. esp so for those many who are blinded by their emotions, ose the focus about forum discussion and started wagging their tongues and too often self-righteousness. his tone has been balanced by both strength and gentleness. he shld deserve the standing ovation!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>&lt;&gt;<br><br>doesn't this statement just speaks of itself.<br><br>the Christian's faith doesn't believes in other gods. why the rest of the non-christians can't accept and respect Christians for doing so too?<br><br>by not accepting other beliefs doesn't mean Christians dun respect the person. as i said, ideally by sharing the Christians faith to non-christians, it isn't an act of disrespect, on the contrary, it is an act of love.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It follows that if Christians are allowed to express openly disrespects towards other beliefs, it must be allowed for non christians to condemn christians. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
