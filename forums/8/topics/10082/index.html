            <div class='col-md body'>THE runway markings and lighting are now the focus.<br><br>Almost a week after the crash of the ill-fated SIA Boeing 747-400, questions are being asked about them.<br><br>So far, the focus has been on pilot error as initial investigations have revealed that the plane had taken off from the wrong runway.<br><br>The pilots had turned into the wrong runway. But did he make that mistake because of the way the airport is managed?<br><br>Two pilots interviewed by the International Herald Tribune say that for years, pilots flying into Taiwan had complained about lighting and markings on the runways at Chiang Kai-shek airport.<br><br><strong>COMPLAINTS </strong><br><br>The paper did not name the pilots, but said that a Western pilot had told it that for nine years pilots have been complaining.<br><br>He said that since the construction of a large parking apron for cargo planes at one end of runway 05R, as well as an adjacent cargo terminal, pilots had been warning that its continued lighting and marking as a runway made the taxiway a potential hazard.<br><br>The 05R runway is parallel to the main airport runway (05L), from which the crashed plane was supposed to have taken off.<br><br>The pilot added that for many years pilots using the airport had recommended that this runway be marked and lit as a taxiway.<br><br>Said the pilot: "To fail to do so, we argued, was setting a trap for a dark and stormy night."<br><br>And it was a dark and stormy night last Tuesday.<br><br>An Australian pilot interviewed also confirmed that there had been complaints about the marking and lighting at the airport.<br><br>He said that there were complaints that the runways and taxiways were not properly differentiated.<br><br>Mr Yong Kay, head of Taiwan's Aviation Safety Council, said he was looking into whether pilots had been complaining for years.<br><br>The Aviation Safety Council is leading the official investigation into the crash.<br><br>Mr Yong said that in Taiwan, runways were normally lit at night by white centre and edge lights, while taxiways had a green centre line of lights, but no edge lights.<br><br>However, there are doubts on whether the edge lights were on.<br><br>According to The Asian Wall Street Journal, flight attendants interviewed by Mr Yong's team say lights on the side of the wrong runway were lit.<br><br><strong>STILL USED AS TAXIWAY</strong><br><br>But Mr Yong said the staff at the control tower say the switch for the runway sidelights was off. He is still hoping to interview third parties on this issue.<br><br>The airport had notified all airlines using the airport on Aug 31 that the wrong runway was under repair and closed for flights.<br><br>But it did not close the beginning of the runway because it was being used as a taxiway.<br><br><strong>Experts retrace last moments</strong><br><br>AN SIA cargo plane (above) was used to simulate SQ006 and retrace the crucial last few minutes after it turned into the wrong runway and crashed.<br><br>On board were 15 investigators - including experts from Taiwan's Aviation Safety Council, Singapore, the US and Australia - Taiwanese officials said yesterday.<br><br>The simulation was carried out at 3.30am yesterday to match conditions when SQ006 crashed at 11.17pm last Tuesday.<br><br>The plane followed the exact route taken by SQ006 before turning onto the top of runway 05R.<br><br>Investigators also tested the radio systems of the control tower and the plane as well as the lighting systems of both runways 05R and 05L.<br><br>The three pilots involved in the crash were not asked to take part.<br><br>They are not allowed to leave Taiwan until investigations are completed.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Wadda think fellaz??? The Cockanathanz dun wanna take even <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">partial</span></strong> responsibility for it, demanding higher compensations and now detaining our pilotz?? NB!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just my thoughts on Taiwanese.<br><br>Taiwan is going through a unstable political moment(Taiwan President constituitional crisis &amp; Chinese aggression), the crash comes in at the same time.<br><br>Unstable political conditions already warrant the decrement of tourist and yet now an air disaster. Taiwanese government would most likely not want it's airport to be involve in this incident.<br><br>Situation as news report in <strong>Singapore</strong> shows that the Taiwanese are definitely trying to shift all responsibility to SIA.<br><br>As quoted from CNN news.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Yong said the pilot, C. K. Foong, knew which runway he was supposed to be on, and that he had not been misdirected by the control tower. However, Yong said there was no indication why Foong was on the wrong runway. </strong><br></blockquote>Plain accusation even before real investigation starts? What are the Taiwanese side trying to prove?<br><br>FYI: Kay Yong is managing director of Taiwan's Aviation Safety Council.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>If both sides of the runway -- which was filled with construction equipment -- were illuminated, the pilot could have mistaken it for a clear airstrip, said Kay Yong, managing director of Taiwan's Aviation Safety Council.<br><br>"If the lights of the runway were not on, then the runway would not look like a runway," Yong told reporters after a briefing with legislators.<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>Contradictions against his words earlier on? Your call.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Investigators have said that visibility was poor late Tuesday night when the plane crashed, and air traffic control -- which didn't have ground radar -- had no way of knowing the pilot was on the wrong runway, which was parallel to the one he was supposed to use.<br><br>Although the pilot told air traffic control that he thought he was on the correct runway, pilot error could not immediately be confirmed as the cause of the crash, Yong said.<br></strong></blockquote><br>Is he trying to say, CKS Airport have no way to inform SQ006 and hence forth CKS Airport control tower has no responsibility in the crash <strong>at all</strong>.<br><br>Further on, as I said before, any <strong>SANE</strong> pilot will not even consider risking his own and the lives of many? Not to even mention there are total of 3 pilots.<br><br>A pilot would risk running into a "unlighted" runaway?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Some Taiwanese relatives, however, have demanded U.S. dlrs 600,000 from the airline since the preliminary findings of the investigation were released<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>As directly quoted from CNN, <strong>Taiwanese relatives only.......</strong><br><br><blockquote><strong><br>The pilot was supposed to take off on the runway marked with a big red sign saying "5L-23R." The strip was next to the closed runway, "5R-23L." The runways were also marked with an "05L" and "05R" painted on the airstrip's surface.<br><br>American attorney Gerald Sterns, who specializes in representing air crash victims' families, said the airport might have been able to avoid confusion by altering the "5R-23L" sign on the repaired runway.<br><br>"The best defense is to put up a sign that says, 'Runway Closed.' It's no big deal," the San Francisco-based lawyer said.<br><br>He also said that during big storms the control tower, which doesn't have ground radar, should use its radio to warn pilots about the closed runway to make sure they aren't using it. The "black box" cockpit recorder indicated that wasn't done with the Singapore Airlines flight.<br><br></strong></blockquote><br><br>A quote a lawyer from <strong>neither of the 2 nations</strong>. Unbiased and fair. More could have been done.<br><br>Not forgetting as far as news had said, locally or from other nations, it will take 1-2 years to fully investigate the air crash.<br><br><strong>1-2 years</strong>, delaying to tide the storm?(Politcal stability in Taiwan and further involvement in air crash would result in decline of economic?)<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>The recording begins from 18 seconds after 11:15 p.m. (1515 GMT). Runway 5L was open; runway 5R was closed for repairs.<br><br>11:15.18 - ATC (tower) said to SIA 006: "Singapore 6 runway 05 left (5L). Wind 020 (degrees) at 28 (knots). Gust to 50. Clear for take off."<br><br>11:15.26 - Captain: "Clear for take off. Runway 05 left. Singapore 6."<br><br>11:16.19 - Captain: "We can see the runway not so bad.
