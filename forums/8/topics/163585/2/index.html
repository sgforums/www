Some more he's in blue uniform (not the TP type), wearing a beret. I forgot to ask for his ID. Nevertheless, I only showed him my driver's license (no home address).<br><br>Now that I asked my friend who has worked in Police Force before, he told me it may be the subcontracted folks like Primas or Cisco fellas, definitely not TP. He told me it may even be Carpark attendants who has overstepped their boundaries, perhaps to meet quota and provide more for their bonus. Now, I feel cheated.<br><br>In any case, next time for jaywalking, I'm gonna challenge them to handcuff me back to the police station after getting their ID. I'm not the only one that jaywalked that road. Damn it!<br><br></div>
