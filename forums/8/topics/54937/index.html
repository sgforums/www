            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Microsoft braces for Part 2 of worldwide Internet attack</strong></span><br><br>By HELEN JUNG<br>AP BUSINESS WRITER<br><br>SEATTLE -- Microsoft Corp. may write flawed software, but it can take solace in the fact that the author of the "blaster" worm also makes mistakes.<br><br>And that error may be Microsoft's biggest weapon in fending off part two of an Internet attack. The worm has infected more than 350,000 computers around the world since Monday. On Friday, computer experts said, the worm was entering its second phase, aiming to bring down Microsoft's Web site for software patches by flooding it with traffic.<br><br>The federal Department of Homeland Security said Friday it had not noticed any second phase problems from the worm yet, but urged home users and small and mid-sized businesses to download the patch.<br><br>The virus-like infection, also dubbed "LovSan" or "MSBlast," exploits a flaw in most current versions of Microsoft's Windows operating system for personal computers, laptops and server computers. Although Microsoft posted a software patch to fix the flaw on July 16, many users failed to download it, leaving them vulnerable.<br><br>The worm caused computers to reboot frequently or disrupted users' browsing on the Internet. But it also packed a second punch: starting at midnight local time on Aug. 16, infected computers that have not cleaned up the virus will in effect turn into a legion of zombies instructed to repeatedly call up a Microsoft Web site that houses the software patch. With so much traffic flooding the network, the site could be unreachable and computer users would be unable to access the patch.<br><br>But there's a flaw. The worm instructed computers to call up http://windowsupdate.com - which is an incorrect address for reaching the actual Microsoft Web site that houses the software patch. Although Microsoft has long redirected those who visited that incorrect address to the real site - http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com - the company disabled the automatic redirection Thursday in preparation for the onslaught of infected computers.<br><br>Microsoft's real Web site should still be accessible to users, said Microsoft spokesman Sean Sundwall. However, those who don't know the correct address may be confused and believe that the so-called "denial of service" attack worked. The company is taking other measures to keep its site up and running, he said, although he declined to give specifics.<br><br>Microsoft's network and others around the country may still see a slowdown in Internet traffic simply from the volume of activity the worm is expected to generate from its legion of infected computers, said Vincent Weafer, senior director of security response for Symantec Corp, a security and antivirus company.<br><br>However, considering that Microsoft has disabled the automatic link from the incorrect Web site to the correct Web site, the worm's effects are "not going to be catastrophic," he said. "The Internet by itself is very resilient.<br><br>"It's a very simple and effective way of redirecting a denial of service attack into nowhere," Weafer said.<br><br>The rate of new infections has slowed, he said. But computer users who still have not downloaded the patch need to do so, he said, adding that the company expects new infections to continue for as long as two years.<br><br>The worm left behind a love note on vulnerable computers: "I just want to say LOVE YOU SAN!" It also carried a hidden message to taunt Microsoft's chairman: "billy gates why do you make this possible? Stop making money and fix your software!"<br><br>Microsoft doesn't take the taunt personally, said Sundwall.<br><br>"Certainly we have had our naysayers in the past and I think those who have an ax to grind and happen to know how to write some code sometimes choose this mechanism to exhibit their frustration," he said.<br><br>Sundwall noted that Microsoft has been trying to make its software more secure, even before the "Trustworthy Computing" memo that Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates sent in January 2002, emphasizing the need for security and spawning months of training for developers on how to tighten up their code. Despite that initiative, the flaw appeared in Windows Server 2003, the first new operating system to come out since the Trustworthy Computing campaign began.<br><br>Sundwall said there's more work to be done, and that Microsoft is looking for any ways to improve its security. "Most people would agree while we have a long way to go ... we've come a long way," Sundwall said.<br><br></div>
