            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, in one of the other threads started by firewire, someone mentioned about guys liking skinny girls.<br><br>Now, is this true?<br><br>My previous girlfriend once said to me that I only went out with skinny girls and I said she must be wrong. So, she made me think back and the last few gfriends I've had have all been skinny.<br><br>But then my mother is fairly big so that could have something to do with it. Don't laugh, my gfriend says she could never go out with a black man because it would remind her too much of her father.<br><br>Any thoughts by anyone?<br><br>Solaar<br>skinny himself, but weighing in at 10 stone</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Cheers Fire.<br><br>On the subject of my gfriend and my mother, they are very different in all ways (my mother is white and ample, my gf is skinny and black!).<br><br>Their behaviour is very different as well. My mum is very kind and caring, whereas my gf is more in control of her feelings. Still, its early days yet and maybe something of a likeness will appear.<br><br>Also, I've never been a big family man, although I am close to them I never see then despite living only 7 miles away from them. I'm very independant and therefore think I've missed out on watching my family grow. But then they're there when I need them.<br><br>Thoughts Fire?<br><br>Solaar</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>U would be better asking Rinoa because she's the resident Psych student...i only had a brief stint introduction into it in my sociology class in Uni.<br><br>It seems that u might fall into the category that prefers women totally diff from your mom.  Which isn't really all that uncommon either.  I think that u probably answered ur own query in saying that u are independent and don't see ur family much...:-)<br><br>hey you know...I'm like that also.:-)  I never write to them or anything...and when i do it's always for $$$...but they always send it you know...regardless.

            <div class='col-md body'>Solaar.<br>I think this issue of getting a skinny gf has no reference whatsoever with ur parents.Obviously unless u have a traumatic experience and u din want to have a post-memory, u might want to avoid ppl that might give u a relapse of that incident.As far as I am concerned, skinny girls might be more appealing since they look better in most clothings(but finding a skirt might be a problem cos sometimes small is 26cm)<br><br>I think all guys have to agree between fat and skinny most will gladly go for the skinny unless or otherwise stated&gt;<br><br>Fire: Thanks for thinking do highly of me...I am only a student.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Cluon: I was talking to this clinical psychologist in a dinner party and he said he has tried his whole life, but women still remain hard to work out.<br><br>As for skinny girls, I think they most of them don't look too good. Models are skinny because clothes hang around them better. Get them to wear a bit less and some of them can look terrible. They have nice faces, of course, but personally I think they are too skinny for me. Of course, I have to say that looks are for the short term, personality for the long. So, if skinny but can get along, excellent. Looks like playboy model ( they are not skinny) but can't get along, my loss.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, i guess it's just differing taste. like some girls like tall guys (actually most do), some like tanned guys, some like fair... the list goes on. each and every one of us has our personal preference. honestly, i dont thk guys really like SKINNY girls, slim maybe, but not SKINNY. and i know alot of girls who prefer gers with more "flesh" or "ba" as they love to say... i know cos my ex was always asking me to put on more wght, kept going on and on abt being able to break me, blahblahblah..<br><br>i thk the main thg is tt "skinny" girls seem to take more care in their appearance. slobbiness, untidiness, gluttony is more often associated with "fat" ppl than skinny ones. this, i guess, is another result of society's twisted notion or ideal of beauty. essentially, beauty=skinny. models have to be skinny, most are definitely skinnier than normal gers, cos the camera really adds 10kg. "model" beauty, and "street" beauty is totally dif. a girl may look stunning in real life, but average on film. another girl might look emancipated in person, but totally beautiful in photos. so basically, it really doesnt matter what "type" of girl, or even guy, you like 'cos in the end, when you really "settle down" looks wldnt be a deciding factor wld it? if it is, then it's your loss.<br><br>and being skinny isnt gd! trust me on tt... you get stuffed w all the extra food, scolded when you go to the gym, and ppl ask if you have an eating disorder. and it's horrible finding clothes... everythg's too short!!!! argh. end up w either miniskirts, or hipsters. sigh. and other gers love to bitch abt you.. the bitches lah, those tt try desperately to diet and hate all those who actually manage to hit their "ideal" weight.<br><br>all in all, the wght doesnt matter... like many mentioned, at the end, it's still her personality and character tt counts.</div>

In the last decade, they used to tell gals that they were too skinny to get a guy,<br>now even parents are telling their kids to be thin, or 'fat then cannot get a husband'<br>Hello?Wats this obsession with body type?<br><br>Do u guys really like skinny girls?<br><br>A total stranger called me fat....wats this derogatory thing about not being model skinny?He made it seem like it was my fault for not being skinny and pretty.<br><br>So would u guys prefer someone with some meat on her, I don't mean godzilla, or someone who looks like Kate moss, body lah!<br><br>I am meaty, such that it is difficult to buy jeans cos of the disparity between hip and waist...but...must i fit in with the fashion to be skinny?<br></div>
