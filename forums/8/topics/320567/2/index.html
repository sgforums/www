              <p>i am into STI ETF. Low cost fund with a good long term projected returns of 9-11%. Personally I think for a period of 5 years, it will go beyond that.</p>
              <p>You can buy it like a Unit Trust too with a monthly deduction. In that way, you spread your risk with dollar cost averaging which means over a very long time, you are almost certain to make a good profit, just a matter of how good. With STI ETF which is an Exchange Traded Fund closely pegged to the performance of the STI, the confidence is that STI is bound to be on the upward curve over the long term despite the short term fluctuations.</p>
              <p>The biggest downside for STI ETF i see is that the time that funds will be tied in. But hey its better than leaving it in a bank! I am deducting $250 every month.</p>

              <p>As a stock, it can liquidated anytime, i believe you know that already hehe</p>
              <p>As what I am doing, the other downside which to me is not a big downside is that it can only be liquidated in a whole lot. Because I only deduct $250 per month, I may end up with number of shares that look like this after 10 months : 769 shares. The policy is that you can only liquidate if you have a whole lot, meaning 1000 shares. At my rate of deduction of $250 per month,you may need around a year before you may possibly have that ONE lot. SO liquidation will take one year at least but this mode of investment was never meant to be liquidated fast lah... so do it only if you have extra money to be set aside every month.....</p>

              <p>If you got less than a thousand, just save the money in the
                                              bank. It will do the job. But if you have around $5000 at least,
                                              there are things which will give you a good return. If dun wan
                                              stocks and dun wan too long, i would suggest foreign exchange fixed
                                              deposit which can be deposited for 1 - 6 months which good returns
                                              of like 7-8% for AUD.</p>
              <p>----------------------</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How do you go about opening a fixed deposit account in foreign currencies, can it be done thru the local banks? and how do you hedge against currency risk?</p>

How about if one day im desperate to sell the same soft drink to you at $0.30? You have got a good bargain. :D</p>
              <p>This example do not only apply in stocks, it applies to all invesments, be it property, commodities and investment funds.</p>
              <p>If you dont intend to put in effort to learn about investments, i suggest you go buy index funds. Invest long term. Always invest in what you understand. Cause risk is attributed to something that you do not understand. Just like driving a car, you know how to drive, you are in a safer situation than someone who dont know how to drive.</p>

              <p>If you got less than a thousand, just save the money in the
              bank. It will do the job. But if you have around $5000 at least,
              there are things which will give you a good return. If dun wan

              deposit which can be deposited for 1 - 6 months which good returns
              of like 7-8% for AUD.</p>

              <p>How do you go about opening a fixed deposit account in foreign

              </div>

              <p>Would be too much for me to type it out...the process itself is pretty much found all over the internet... just provide <a href="http://www.tankinlian.com/faq/foreigncurr.html">one of the many such sites....</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>my personal take on hedging against a currency risk is a personal risk you have to undertake. By investing in foreign currencies, you are hoping to earn:</p>
              <p>1) by the high interest rate, which is really very high compare to our singapore rates...</p>
              <p>2) that the currency will appreciate against SGD.</p>
              <p>If an AUD FIXED D gives you 8% for a 3 month lock in period, the possible scenarios are:</p>
              <p>1) You earn the interest plus the currency stagnates against SGD. you get back capital minus off cost which is normally negligible against the interest earned, esp if you use the better method of changing the currency with an online platform like POEMS and TX to the bank rather then converting at the bank itself.</p>
              <p>2) You earn the interest plus the currency appreciates against SGD and earn on that appreciation upon conversion back to SGD</p>
              <p>3) You earn the interest but the currency depreciates at a rate lower than interest against SGD. So you still get back your capital plus some interest earned</p>
              <p>4) You earn the interest but the currency depreciates at a rate higher than interest earned against SGD. You suffer capital loss.</p>
              <p>With 4 possible scenarios, you are only at risk of loss with one scenario. Therefore, it is important for yourself to analyse and take a personal risk on whether within that 3-6 months of investment, what is the possibility of the currency depreciating so much you will suffer capital loss esp when the interest earned is so much higher than singapore rates. That is the risk you have to undertake yourself...dun think even the experts can give a 100% assessment of what will happen 3-6 months down the road.</p>

              <p>I posted the general process in my last reply, so take a look at that. I have not dwell into too much becos of the minimum $5000 needed. Its a lump sum to invest but I will look into that soon. I dun have too much info yet. It is definitely 8% with periods ranging from 3-6 months. BUT i do not know whether it is 8% based on a 6 month/12 months locked in or prorated for 3 months.... it is better to call various banks to check their interest rates and their terms. Different banks offer different interest rates for AUD fixed D...</p>
