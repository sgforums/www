              <p>I posted the general process in my last reply, so take a look at that. I have not dwell into too much becos of the minimum $5000 needed. Its a lump sum to invest but I will look into that soon. I dun have too much info yet. It is definitely 8% with periods ranging from 3-6 months. BUT i do not know whether it is 8% based on a 6 month/12 months locked in or prorated for 3 months.... it is better to call various banks to check their interest rates and their terms. Different banks offer different interest rates for AUD fixed D...</p>

              <p><br><span style="color: #ae3cee;">8% return for $5000 investment within 3-6 months is a good bargain wor.  Put Fixed deposit of $10k wun even get back 3% interest for a 6 months term now lor. </span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Unit Trusts is one of the lowest risk investments if you can find. Unit trusts is meant to be a long term investment, where the returns will increased exponentially if you do the investment for more than 15 years or even 20 years or more. It can be used for a retirement investment or wealth accumulation. Unit trusts will DEFINITELY have negative returns most of the time if you are looking to liquidate your returns within 2 or 3 years or even 5 years. You hardly have capital losses on unit trusts, it did happened with some unit trusts but with most unit trust investments, it is more of an issue of which fund will give you more returns. My view is that an unit trust is definitely better than a bank, earning returns of at least 4% and above and with a pretty manageable risks due to the dollar cost averaging.</p></div>

              <p>my personal take on hedging against a currency risk is a personal risk you have to undertake. By investing in foreign currencies, you are hoping to earn:<br><br>1) by the high interest rate, which is really very high compare to our singapore rates...<br><br>2) that the currency will appreciate against SGD.<br><br>If an AUD FIXED D gives you 8% for a 3 month lock in period, the possible scenarios are:<br><br>1) You earn the interest plus the currency stagnates against SGD. you get back capital minus off cost which is normally negligible against the interest earned, esp if you use the better method of changing the currency with an online platform like POEMS and TX to the bank rather then converting at the bank itself.<br><br>2) You earn the interest plus the currency appreciates against SGD and earn on that appreciation upon conversion back to SGD<br><br>3) You earn the interest but the currency depreciates at a rate lower than interest against SGD. So you still get back your capital plus some interest earned<br><br>4) You earn the interest but the currency depreciates at a rate higher than interest earned against SGD. You suffer capital loss.<br><br>With 4 possible scenarios, you are only at risk of loss with one scenario. Therefore, it is important for yourself to analyse and take a personal risk on whether within that 3-6 months of investment, what is the possibility of the currency depreciating so much you will suffer capital loss esp when the interest earned is so much higher than singapore rates. That is the risk you have to undertake yourself...dun think even the experts can give a 100% assessment of what will happen 3-6 months down the road.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the info, i myself have some assets in US dollars bought a couple of months ago. To hedge agianst the USD i also bought a bearish USD fund. Basically this fund moves in opposite direction to the USD. So if USD goes down (aginast the major currencies of the world) as whats is happening now, this fund goes uo in value. Its a nice hedge.</p>

              <p>Nope you still have to open up a Foreign Currency FD with a bank here. However, most people convert their SGD to the other currency with the banks too and the spread for conversion of currencies charged by the banks are usually high mostly 1% and above. If you go through POEMS, their spread charged is usually very little, less than 0.5%, so what you do is to convert your currency through POEMS and instruct them to transfer it over to your Bank's Foreign currency FD. You need to pay a one time TX charge but usually the amount you save on the spread is so much more. A bit more troublesome but saves you a couple of hundreds.</p>

              <p>Easy, just buy index funds like the STI ETF. It has the lowest management cost and gives out dividends every year. Unlike unit trusts which has a management fee of 3-5% which eats up into your profits.</p>

              <p>Correct me if im wrong.</p>
              <p>8% returns for 3 months= 36% returns per yr (by reinvesting the 8% returns you have compounded for the yr)</p>
              <p>Calculation using $100 initial capital:</p>
              <p>1st 3 months: $100 x 108%= $108</p>
              <p>2nd 3 months: $108 x 108%= $116.64</p>
              <p>3rd 3 months: $116.64 x 108%= $125.97</p>
              <p>4th 3 months: $125.97 x 108%= $136.04</p>
              <p>For the year your profit is $36 with initial capital of $100. Very good returns!</p>
              <p>Indian banks 11% i.r for 3 yrs would only give you  3.6% per yr. That is lousy.</p>
              <p>I dont really know the banking system well, pls enlighten me about the first part 8% returns on AUD FIXED D 3 mth lock-in period.</p>

              <p>hi guys,</p>
              <p>i've noticed that some of you were contemplating investing in a foreign currency because of the fact that they offer higher returns. i'd just like to share my thoughts on some of the comments above.</p>
              <p>there are reasons why interest rates are so high for countries like India, Australia etc. Because there are other things to consider. For example, India's inflation is roughly about 10%. What does that mean to us? It means that there is a possiblity that the currency will be worth less in the future. How will that affect us? Because we are ultimately going to get our money back in SGD, the exchange rate will play a very important role in determining whether we will make money from that investment.</p>
              <p>I am no fortune teller, neither will i be able to tell you which currency will do well. But I'd just hope people here understand the concept of exchange rates versus interest rates. Let's look at an optimistic scenario:- let's say we put our money in an Australian account bearing 7% interest. Should things go well, the Singapore Dollar will start to weaken against the Australian dollar after we put our money in so that when we want to take our money (AUD) out, we will be able to change our Australian Dollars to more Singapore Dollars. This gives us 2 returns. 1) from the 7% interest, 2) from the exchange rate.</p>
              <p>Conversely,  if  the AUD  strengthens considerably against the SGD we might see the money we have put into the Australian Dollar account diminishing instead of giving the returns we expected.</p>
              <p>What I am trying to say is quite simple really. You are rewarded for taking risk. In this case you will bear interest rate risk as well as exchange rate risk if you invest in a foreign currency account. Granted, the value of the currencies wont drop to zero in a few months, but in a severe scenario you might see the value of your money diminishing rather than growing.</p>
              <p> </p>
