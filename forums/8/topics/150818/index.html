            <div class='col-md body'>I am a Chinese Singaporean living in America at the moment so I am very well aware of the racial structure in today's States. It has been 4 years since I came to this "Land of the Promise" in pursue of my education.<br><br>However, in that 4 years, I have never forgotten my roots as a Chinese. I do not force myself to blend in with the Whites by imitating their cultures and lifestyles. I came to the conclusion that most Asians, predominantly females, have tried to conceal their Asian roots by forcing their tongues to wield the American accent. What I find amusing was when I spoke one of the Asian languages with them (I am fluent in Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese, English, Hokkien and Indonesia), these American-wannabes women would refuse to communicate in their mother tongues but instead, tried in vain to haphazardly imitate the foreign accent of the Americans. Sure some of you may agree that what they are trying to do is no more than an attempt to accustom themselves to the foreign land. What is more disturbing is these breed of Asians (I term them as "culturally-dysfunctional" ) would label one another as "low-class", "bumpkins", "fobs" or "chinks". Their eyes would look into another Asian with a derogatory look. Their circles of friends would be limited to only the Westerners. Not to mention that these dysfunctional breed of Asians would only date Westerners. Such is the extent of their prejudice against their own race and people.<br><br>The question is why would Asians possess such low self-esteem when it is statistically proven that Asian Americans are placed the highest in terms of an average annual income in American households. Upon hearing similar experiences in Singapore, I realized that this phenomena of "Westernization" is in fact penetrating to our motherlands. Many fail to realize that this is a crisis that requires attention.<br><br>Due to the extent of "westernization" I have witnessed among female Asians in America, I have started to conceive this invisible barrier between America and me for instance, I have stopped viewing Hollywood movies, listening to English songs or even communicate with Westerners. No vocabulary in English would be enough to describe my disgust at the Asians who are practicing the boot-licking ritual.<br><br>To those who doubt your social standings in the human race, I would like to assure my fellow Asians that we are of equal status and footing as compared to the Wersterners for none is more superior than the other.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, join me in this battle against "Wersternization". Bear the torch that light our paths towards Racial Equality. Our government should pass a genocide edict which will remove the dysfunctional breed of Asians from our gene pool.<br><br></div>

I got some of that sh!t from asians during my visit over there in CA - SF &amp; LA.

There are a lot of Low Class Ang Moh but people's eye got stamp. All this while the ang moh are trying to give up their own heritage and do a poor imitation of eastern cultures and mocking the east while they are at it.<br><br>But what's the point of talking to close minded people who choose to think they are superior by immitating white.<br></div>

It has been 4 years since I came to this "Land of the Promise" in pursue of my education.<br><br>However, in that 4 years, I have never forgotten my roots as a Chinese. I do not force myself to blend in with the Whites by imitating their cultures and lifestyles. I came to the conclusion that most Asians, predominantly females, have tried to conceal their Asian roots by forcing their tongues to wield the American accent. What I find amusing was when I spoke one of the Asian languages with them (I am fluent in Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese, English, Hokkien and Indonesia), these American-wannabes women would refuse to communicate in their mother tongues but instead, tried in vain to haphazardly imitate the foreign accent of the Americans. Sure some of you may agree that what they are trying to do is no more than an attempt to accustom themselves to the foreign land. What is more disturbing is these breed of Asians (I term them as "culturally-dysfunctional" ) would label one another as "low-class", "bumpkins", "fobs" or "chinks". Their eyes would look into another Asian with a derogatory look. Their circles of friends would be limited to only the Westerners. Not to mention that these dysfunctional breed of Asians would only date Westerners. Such is the extent of their prejudice against their own race and people.<br><br>The question is why would Asians possess such low self-esteem when it is statistically proven that Asian Americans are placed the highest in terms of an average annual income in American households. Upon hearing similar experiences in Singapore, I realized that this phenomena of "Westernization" is in fact penetrating to our motherlands. Many fail to realize that this is a crisis that requires attention.<br><br>Due to the extent of "westernization" I have witnessed among female Asians in America, I have started to conceive this invisible barrier between America and me for instance, I have stopped viewing Hollywood movies, listening to English songs or even communicate with Westerners. No vocabulary in English would be enough to describe my disgust at the Asians who are practicing the boot-licking ritual.<br><br>To those who doubt your social standings in the human race, I would like to assure my fellow Asians that we are of equal status and footing as compared to the Wersterners for none is more superior than the other.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, join me in this battle against "Wersternization".
