            <div class='col-md body'>Assuming a normal person, when the person is awake, the person's mind is able to interpret. However when the person sleeps, the body system slows down. The mind is still there but it is so called dormant. It is unable to interpret. Dreams, however, are like so called replay or movie using the 'info' in our mind/brain. The 'info' in our mind/brain are not sorted out in a systematic way so the 'replay' tends to be random mix n match into a movie. Day-dreams are 'replays' too but its within our control. We direct the movie.<br>Anyway, this is entirely made up by me no concrete facts or evidence or whatsoever. Just my point of view about dreams. If no dreams, then no dreams. Hehe. This theory of mine is only if the person has dreams.<br>Therefore, my point is, maybe something which you had experienced quite recently was 'replayed back into a random movie' in your dream.<br><br>If my crap is a bit confusing, I explain in examples. For example, for the thread-starter, maybe earlier during the day, she had saw an old man or an old lady. Maybe she read some news in the newspaper about some elderly people. Maybe she encountered,read or saw something that has got to do with hands or breathing difficulty.<br>Sometimes my dreams are different but the endings will somehow coincides with the ringing of my alarm clock. For example, I was chasing vampires then suddenly a bicycle starts to ring behind me. As I turn around, I woke up from my dream only to find out my alarm is ringing.</div>

My fren says he WILL have it when he sleeps at night, if he had an afternoon nap.<br><br>As for the "bei gui ya", my version is suddenly awake, den discover that you cant move AT ALL, but my eyes can open but i don dare haha, like ur body is paralysed like that. Scientific explanation: You brain produces an amino acid (issit glutamine? forgot liao) when you sleep to <span style="font-style: italic;">paralyse</span> ur body, yes to paralyse so that you wun act out your dreams! If you suddenly awake, then the effect haven worn off, so u cant move, after a while, u can.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>OK I try to interpret your dream for you.<br><br>After an extensive study using linear regression analysis, I concluded:<br><br>You are stressed/ feeling pressurized, therefore the feeling manifest in a dream where someone cover your eyes from behind.<br><br>You didn't have enough time or comfort when you slept that time, therefore you mixed up dream experience and real-life awake experience, as if somebody really cover your eyes as you sleep on the bed.<br><br>Conclusion:<br><br>You are stressed and not having enough sleep.<br><br>Recommendation:<br><br>Relax, and sleep more.<br><br>Dosage instructions:<br><br>Once per day, at night, after meal.</div>
