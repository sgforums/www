If I am cocky, sure! Cause I don't complain like the kuniang whiners here who live under their parent's generosity and yet whine and whine about the naggin' from the mommy. Then maybe the next moment ask mommy for a glass of milk and make sure its 10 Deg cause little boy boy don't like it any other way.  I can be proud of saying if I don't like my mom nagging, I will tell it to her face but I don't and I respect her for telling me things and I listen and engage her in a conversation. I handle it like an adult while I support myself and not on my parent's charity or be their burden unlike the Whiners here, who are definitely well fed babies but are quite ungrateful and obviously immature. If these whiners are unhappy with mommy and daddy's nagging, then move out, live on their own, have some balls and then they can go home and visit their parents and tell them in their face to shutup. Then I will respect these kuniangs.<br><br>If the whiners think that its right to complain about parent's nagging, it reflect the kind of child he is towards the parents and I feel sad for the parent. It also reflect the kind of parents who failed to teach him properly anything but disrespect. It also reflect the kind of character the whiner has and really, he is a no ball arse hole who live in the comfort of his parent's money but thinks he is right to complain about the person who makes his life comfortable.<br></div>
