            <div class='col-md body'>After subtracting out all external sensory data, it turns out that one can still "see" images, "hear" sounds, "feel" sensations, "taste" flavors, "smell" odors -- one does not have to use the physical sense organs to have these experiences. For example, when dreaming, it seems as if we are seeing things, but we aren't using our physical eyes at all. It seems as if we are hearing things, feeling things, etc., but we aren't using our real physical sense organs to experience these events. They are completely mental, completely imaginary. So in fact, all sensory experiences can arise within consciousness itself, without necessarily having any sense organs at all.<br><br>Given the above, there is no logical reason to assume that awareness is taking place "inside" of our brain, mind, body or anything else for that matter. Awareness has no particular form, no size, no shape, no color, no substance, no energy, no dimensions -- so how can we say it has a location or can be contained by anything?<br><br>If awareness has no location, then how can we say that it is anywhere? Or that it isn't anywhere? And in that case, how do we know that awareness is "inside" the universe, rather than the opposite? Maybe the universe is actually "inside" of awareness? In our previous thought-experiment, we arrived at a level in which there are no external sensations yet awareness is still present. Furthermore, as we know from dreaming, even without using the external sense organs the mind can experience any sensation as if it were a real "external" and "physical" sensation. So the question is, given that the mind can do this, how can we tell whether or not what appear to be our present physical, external sensations are actually existing in the way that they appear? How can we be certain they are any different from mental-hallucinations or dreams? How can we be certain that what is appearing isn't simply a dream or hallucination taking place in the field of awareness?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pure Awareness does not come from a cause, it is said to be <strong>unborn</strong>, and therefore undying. It is not an object, materialless, yet nowhere is it not found. Therefore it is known as all-pervading and omnipresent. The true nature of ourselves is only this Pure Awareness. When we do not impute reality, it is mere Pure Awareness, <strong>neither is there seperation of inner and outer</strong>. But every time when a condition and cause arise, contact is made, perception arise almost immediately, that is the problem. Therefore the immediate Awareness is not known. Pure Awareness is like a clear bright mirror that reflects anything that comes in its way, but due to our illusions, it is covered up like a layer of dust on top of the mirror.<br><br>Conventionally, all the 'things' we see, hear, etc, experience, all these things are dream-like, they are all conditioned arisings, empty. Since they are empty, it is ungraspable.<br><br>So it doesnt mean phenomenal existence is seperate from our true nature of pure awareness. There is no purest state, every moment NOW is purest. Every moment is Pure Awareness (although he might not be mindful and aware). Whether in dream or in life, whether one is delusioned or enlightened, his true nature is not lessened or increased. It is only the matter of ignorance or awakening.<br><br>----<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Chuang-Tzu once dreamed he was a butterfly. When he awoke, he no longer knew if he was a butterfly dreaming he was a man, or a man who had dreamed he was a butterfly.</span><br><br>-----<br><br>"Besides, we all talk of 'me.' How do you know what is this 'me' that we speak of? You dream you are a bird, and soar to heaven, or dream you are a fish, and dive into the ocean's depths. And you cannot tell whether the man now speaking is awake or in a dream. "A man feels a pleasurable sensation before he smiles, and smiles before he thinks how he ought to smile. Resign yourself to the sequence of things, forgetting the changes of life, and you shall enter into the pure, the divine, the One."<br><br>- Chuang Tzu<br><br>------<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Tao is omnipresent, even in excrement.<br><br>Tung-kuo Tzu asked Chuang Tzu "Where is the Tao?"<br>`It is everywhere,' replied Chuang Tzu.<br>Tung-kuo Tzu said "You must be more specific."<br>"It is in the ant" said Chuang Tzu.<br>"Why go down so low?"<br>"It is in the weeds."<br>"Why even lower?"<br>"It is in a potsherd."<br>"Why still lower?"<br>"It is in the excrement and urine," said Chuang Tzu.<br><br>There is nothing that is not so-and-so.

For example, when dreaming, it seems as if we are seeing things, but we aren't using our physical eyes at all. It seems as if we are hearing things, feeling things, etc., but we aren't using our real physical sense organs to experience these events. They are completely mental, completely imaginary. So in fact, all sensory experiences can arise within consciousness itself, without necessarily having any sense organs at all.<br><br>Given the above, there is no logical reason to assume that awareness is taking place "inside" of our brain, mind, body or anything else for that matter. Awareness has no particular form, no size, no shape, no color, no substance, no energy, no dimensions -- so how can we say it has a location or can be contained by anything?<br><br>If awareness has no location, then how can we say that it is anywhere? Or that it isn't anywhere? And in that case, how do we know that awareness is "inside" the universe, rather than the opposite? Maybe the universe is actually "inside" of awareness? In our previous thought-experiment, we arrived at a level in which there are no external sensations yet awareness is still present. Furthermore, as we know from dreaming, even without using the external sense organs the mind can experience any sensation as if it were a real "external" and "physical" sensation. So the question is, given that the mind can do this, how can we tell whether or not what appear to be our present physical, external sensations are actually existing in the way that they appear? How can we be certain they are any different from mental-hallucinations or dreams? How can we be certain that what is appearing isn't simply a dream or hallucination taking place in the field of awareness?</div></blockquote>THERE YOU GO AGAIN....

Taoism has no relation with Buddhism, especially during Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu's times, Buddhism is not in contact with China yet. But Lao Tzu's realisations are truly great. But pls take note that Modern Taoism is not the same as that practised in the past.<br><br><blockquote>At least both religion are never close to Cristianity which is good..phew..</blockquote>You may be surprised. Every major religion has its 'contemplative' side and their realisations are similar. There are subtler differences in terms of the level of understanding of emptiness as compared to Buddhism, but all contemplatives and mystics from all traditions do have glimpses into their Buddha Nature/God Nature/Pure Consciousness. There is a mystic from the New Age side, longchen, he also had his realisations and discusses on my forum. He is not a Buddhist but recalled his past life as a Tibetan monk 2 lifetimes ago.<br><br>See: <a href="http://members.aol.com/Heraklit1/eckhart.htm" rel="nofollow">http://members.aol.com/Heraklit1/eckhart.htm</a> - Christian Mystics<br><a href="http://hometown.aol.com/heraklit1/ibnarabi.htm" rel="nofollow">http://hometown.aol.com/heraklit1/ibnarabi.htm</a> - Sufi Muslim Mystics<br><a href="http://www.ramana-maharshi.org/books.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ramana-maharshi.org/books.htm</a> - Hindu/Advaita<br><br>You realise those who are into contemplation, whether christian, sufi mystics (which is why I posted sufi links in the islam forum - <a href="http://islam.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=162957" rel="nofollow">The True Meaning of Jihad</a>), etc, buddhists, they never have a history of violence. It is always those religious scholarly types who are binded by dogmas and they are the ones who are intolerant and fought wars, and are highly egotistic.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by An Eternal Now:<br><strong>[b]No fanaticism</strong><br><br>Of Buddhism alone can it be affirmed it is free from all fanaticism. Its aim being to produce in every man a thorough internal transforming by self-conquest, how can it have recourse to might or money or even persuasion for effecting conversion?
