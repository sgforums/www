              <br> <br> <br> <br> LONDON (Reuters) - The last survivor of the 1912 sinking of the
              "Titanic," Millvina Dean, has died in a nursing home in England at the
              age of 97, the Titanic International Society said on Monday.
              <br>Dean was just nine weeks old when her family sold a pub they owned
              in London to travel on the maiden voyage of the passenger liner and
              begin a new life in Wichita, Kansas, in the United States, where her
              father Bertram hoped to open a tobacconist shop.
              <br> <br> Her father was one of the 1,517 people who died after the supposedly unsinkable ship hit an iceberg in the Atlantic and sank.
              <br> <br>Dean, who was wrapped in a sack to protect her from the cold and
              lowered into a lifeboat, was the youngest of the 706 Titanic survivors.
              Her mother Georgetta and two-year-old brother Bertram also survived,
              dying in 1975 and 1992 respectively.
              <br> <br>Dean, who never married, said she had no memory of the disaster but
              was told of the event at the age of eight when her mother was about to
              remarry.
              <br> <br>It wasn't until Dean was aged in her 70s that she became a Titanic
              celebrity, appearing at conventions, exhibitions and in documentaries
              and other media about the ill-fated ship.
              <br> <br>The Titanic International Society said on its website that Dean
              passed away in her sleep early Sunday at a nursing home near
              Southampton. She was recently released from hospital after a bout with
              pneumonia.
              <br> <br>Last month the stars of the Hollywood blockbuster movie "Titanic"
              -- Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet and the film's director James
              Cameron -- donated $30,000 to support Dean in her last years after it
              was reported that she had resorted to selling her autograph to pay her
              nursing home bills.
              <br> <br>The 1997 drama "Titanic" made more than $1.8 billion at the
              worldwide box office, making it the highest-grossing film of all time
              in figures not adjusted for inflation.
