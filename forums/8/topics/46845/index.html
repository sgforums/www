Anyway the cats don't really get into anybody's way, do they?<br>I agree that something is seriously wrong with the eduction system. Guess the govt had breed Singaporeans into pple that rely on the govt for everything and when something goes wrong.. who to blame? the govt of cos! isn't the govt in charge of the education cirriculum?<br>Being a born n bred singaporean, i guess all this debating still comes to nought, as what the govt wants, the govt gets?

"no wat, we eat them for so long, sur no problem wan la!" then boom... too late liaoz. anyway the gov is trying to do their job, just let them. at least the gov is not like some hitler wannabe or some crazed world domination thing.  instead of coorperating and helping them to do their job, all we do is critisize and complain, and bite them in the arse. wat if the cats really spread something, then i bet everyone here will change their tunes and feel tt the gov is doing their job for culling the cats.  hypocritical ain't it?</div>
