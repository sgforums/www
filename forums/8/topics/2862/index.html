            <div class='col-md body'>I just got home from the millenium party from Suntec City and I'm fuming mad.<br>The people was so tigthly packed that canned sardines seemed to have more space.<br><br>But what really disappointed me was what happened at MacDonalds'. The management needed to exercise crowd control as there really was a lot of people. They were letting people in by batches, a new batch comes in when the counters are all cleared. So basically there was only exit for the customers until a batch is cleared.<br><br>Some f@cking idiots just can't seem to understand why there is a need for crowd control. The only thing on their mind is to purchase the 'Kitty' plush. So they push forward every time they see people coming out. I was right at the front with a couple in front of me. Then came a Beng with his girlfriend. The squeeze got really bad and the guy in front told his girlfriend to get out. The dumb f@ck behind didn't, so I had to be careful not to fall on his girl when the pushing gets tough. So there I was standing there and getting squeezed for 40 min. In the process I keep hearing the dumb @ss behind complaining about the management not letting people in there's plenty of space inside....(he did it thru the whole time he was there). At least his girlfriend was understanding enough to try to calm him down and tell him the reason..(to no avail).<br><br>What really pissed me off was when this mother carrying a baby tried to come out of Macdonalds'. The SOBs pushed so hard the mother almost fell.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>When my batch was allowed in, the crowd just poured in like nobody's business. I went halfway thru but my right arm was stuck outside. Then the crowd pushed harder and I got free. The manager unfortunately had his shirt pocket torn off and his name tag ripped out. One of the bengs raised his middle finger as he walked in. Someone from the crew saw it and told everyone to remember the guy. They decided not to sell him anything...(served him right). And to think there were people trying to jump the Qs. When I finally came out of the resturant to meet my friends, I almost collasped from the lack of air and constant pressure from the squeezing.<br><br>Why do people still act this way? Its already a new millenium and it looks as if we are still in the Stone Age Era. Why can't people think about the difficult situations of others? (E.g. The Mac crew was working hard to serve the overwhelming crowd and they were shown the finger. ) I feel so disgusted from the way these people act. I really wished the world ended and everyone got wiped out. At least nothing of this sort would have happened...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hahaha.. I dunnoe what to say but Bangster and I looked really FLUSHED when we came back into the building hahaha... The pushing, pulling and jostling were terrible and it's like the stage is so micro everyone is f***ing each other's backsides... and of people shouting "DUN PUSH, DUN PUSH!".. then others shout "CHONG AH!!!" or "Oi people coming out liao, PUSH to the front!".. wah seh.. and the heat was so intense that it seemed that we really were sardines boiled straight from the can..<br><br>And worse I was wearing white.. it became gray with some black streaks after I came out of that, that, inferno... But the fun part is the challenge to keep your balance is there.. ya know when people push you try to stop them from pushing you.. Haha.. tiring lah but that's abt the only FUN u can have when the stage is so damn bloody f***ing small!!!!!!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway, this is Singapore. In the olden days it would've been much worse. But this kiasu mentality that's imbibed in us didn't fade away much... Did you guys see any Caucasians/tourists squeezing in the crowd? I hope not. They'd dread Singapore for the rest of their lives.<br><br>It's just one of the things, you know. The new millennium. Total chaos. People going wild especially it's like years since the monthly Orchard Rd closures have been on (and btw those closures were banned cos of the way Singaporeans behaved)...<br><br>I guess it's everything to do with society. We just aren't angmohs, you know what I mean. I mean we could've insulted the benglas at Orchard Rd, calling them uncivilised and all but seriously those angmohs could just have been doing the same to us. We're all civilised people, but I guess sometimes we overlook the fact that our social attitudes were very much in sync with our cultural heritage. And it just so happened some things never change... I meant the bad ones as well.<br><br>Why angmohs can pick up their dog's poo in the park and then discard it at the refuse.. why angmohs can greet one another when they see each other on street.. why angmohs know what queing is all about.. why angmoh governments realise the importance of social welfare...<br><br>Singapore is all about striving success in a competitive society. That has been the benchmark, the national motto, since like the 1960s. Our work ethic has brought us economic progress, educational strides, etc. But in all that emphasis on cold hard cash, we have grown little in terms of charity and compassion.<br><br>Well I guess it's a give and take thing. If we didn't had that industrialism and work ethic, Singapore probably be just another Riau island today.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was at suntec too. Its quite baseless to say that ang mohs dun contribute to the disorderliness. Cos i saw quite a no of them trying to push forward even though its obvious that there is no space in front. I know cos i was standing near them. I got elbowed in the head, a child got pushed down by them. So its not true to say that the chaos is caused by Singaporeans alone. Yah some Singaporeans are also involved in the pushing too. Basically i was juz down there saying, "Sorry , sorry........ BLOODY HELL DUN PUSH LAH".<br><br>Yah i was pushed so often by ppl in front and at the back, that i lost my balance quite a no of times. But i was prevented from falling cos its too packed. When i was abt to fall, ppl pushed me back again. At first i was juz following the crowd, later on, i got so pissed off that when ppl tried to push me, i tried to stand firm, to stop them from pushing forward, but sad to say lah, when one of them failed to pushed me forward or backward, his frens joined in and in the end i was pushed to the left and right, thats how i keep crashing into ppl. Yah some ppl tried to keep together by holding to each other back, but the line was juz too long and it got splitted into different segments. Yah too crowded. Can see bfs hugging, cupping, covering their gfs to protect their modesty.<br>Yah saw a few girls only groups. The girl in front is basically holding her hands in front of her, those girls at the back, are leaning close to their female frens back, to prevent being molested. Saw the expressions of some of the girls, angry, offended, disgusted and scared. Sad to say, a lot of them were the target of indecent touching. But then again, i saw some kinds souls there. I think there are many class outings and the guys are quite responsible in the sense that when some of the girls got separated, they immediately went back in to look for them. They tried to prevent the girls being molested, but i think they can do better if they can keep the girls in the centre and with guys ard them. Yah again, saw 1 girl fainted. Can see some girls esp the shorter ones having difficulty breathing.<br><br>The pushing can be prevented if those ppl at the front( those at the stage) stop pushing forward. Sigh..... if ppl could juz have the patience to wait.....<br><br>Mind<br><br>[This message has been edited by Mind (edited 01-01-2000).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by Mind (edited 01-01-2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yah lor, even ang mohs push. In sparse numbers some of them do act like civilised people. In crowds they act just like everyone else. They push, squeeze, and swear. Some very old ones do that too, as do some very young ones. Crowds are all the same.<br><br>[This message has been edited by pacman (edited 01-01-2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was at Plaza Singapura and the crowd there was more civilised though it got pretty hot as everyone sucked in whatever aircon there was. It was quite squeezed in as well. My gf and I were lucky in the sense that the moment the countdown finished, we 'chonged' to PS's Macs for the Kitty plushes, and there were an avg of 5 ppl per counter queueing up already. However things got bad after that when the queues started forming and there was no space left to queue, causing ppl to climb over tables and chairs to get to the queue! It started with one Beng not giving a damn at a table in the middle of the crowd and climbing on top of the table just to get to the other side! Pure rudeness. The kid at the table just sat there in shock as others followed suit! YEt I tot the MRT was way worse than the situation at Mc's. AT City Hall, the moment the doors opened, it was as if a stampede was ineffect wif everyone rushing in and crushing everyone else! Chaos man! Fortunately I was at the side of the door so I could form a protective ring ard my girl with her leaning agst the plastic window. I too noticed some girls very uncomfortable in all the crushing and pushing, esp those dressed for clubbing in rather skimpy clothing. It left a bad impression on me, all this pushing and shoving and rude behaviour... I guess Singapore has a long way to go b4 becoming a 'civilised society'..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yup the pushing started when I alighted at Orchard MRT. The ppl around me pushed and tried all ways and means to get out of the station. Once, out of the gate, they are "guided" the exit at the Popular bookstore. Can say that some ppl already started to swear "~~!@#$%^_+)(*&amp;^$ don't push lah,"<br><br>Wah lau, once outside the station, lagi worse. Like don't know what all the ppl don't  fuck care already, walking on the road as if they owe it. The worst is near the stage itself, everyone is pushing one another, playing "train". Really feel like hantaming the train head and the body.<br><br>Especially don't know frm where, all the foreign workers all released from their construction sites. Saw some ah bengs cuppin their ah lians to prevent ppl from touching them. Pity those that are a bit short and ended up kana squashed by the crowd.<br><br>As it was getting nearer to 12 midnite, lagi worse, all the crowd seems to be moving towards the stage at HMV. Heard that there was a fight around 2 something, pity didn't stay to watch.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Everyone is !@#$%^&amp;_+)**^&amp; pushing forward left and back.

At least ppl at orchard still can wave their hands and there are some space btw each person. But at suntec, the condition is terrible. There is no space btw each person. Everyone is standing shoulder to shoulder. There is no space to sway our hands.
