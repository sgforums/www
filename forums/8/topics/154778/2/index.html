            <div class='col-md body'>i feel these are reasons for not leaving singapore... not exactly staying in singapore... why not give Reasons to LIVE instead of Stay?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by caramon.:</div><div class="quote_body">1. I will never get to meet so many foreigners if I migrate to Austrailia - if I see them in Australia, they are probably tourists and are not there to work and contribute to the country.<br><br>2. If I go, I will begin to miss the HDB flats I stay in, they are very small and easy to clean. If I go to Australia my house will be so big, I will tire myself out cleaning it!<br><br>3. I will miss the MRT &amp; Buses. If I migrate, I'll probably have to buy a car because the public transport there is not as good. Instead of having someone drive me to my destination, I will have to drive myself around, how tiring.<br><br>4. If I migrate to another country, I'll be lost because the govt there does not tell me what to do unlike the Singapore govt.<br><br>5. There will be no NS and reservist to provide me with a break from work and forced exercise.<br><br>6. I might be given welfare when I'm out of job, that might make me lazy.<br><br>7. I might have to vote. For the past 35 years in Singapore, I never have to vote.<br><br>8. The hospitals are not crowded by dengue patients, it might be a lonely experience if I get sick and warded.<br><br>9. The govt ministers are paid only a fraction of what PAP ministers, how can I trust them with my future?<br><br>10. They allow people to protest, what happen if they do it on the street while I'm driving, I might be caught in a jam and be late.<br><br>11. Their newspapers don't give the same views as the govt, that might tire my mind trying to resolve the inconsistency.<br><br>12. I'll miss the Straits Times and Chua Mui Hoong articles.<br><br>13. I'll not get to buy pirated software.<br><br>14. I'll miss all the great govt companies like NTUC, HDB, PUB, SingTel, etc.<br><br>15. I'll miss those sensational murder stories of foreigners getting chopped to pieces and body parts left all over Singapore.</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>On a more serious note,<br><br>Life in singapore will get tougher n tougher. Here are my simply stated broad reasons:<br><br>1) Most of us will be in debt and have loans the moment we get married<br>(eg. home loans, car loans, credit card loans etc.)<br>- Even if you are financially careful, the least you'll incur is home loans which can stretch to as much as 30yrs if you get married unless you don't mind living iwth your parents.<br><br>2) the SG government maintains an open policy regarding foreign talent. There's no restriction on foreign talent. Because SG does not have any natural resources, we rely alot on human resources and with a limited population of 5 million, SG just cannot survive on that, it neeeds to attract as much people as possible.<br>- I know alot of pple are very upset about this, but put it this way, how would you do it if you are the government? SG relies alot on foreign Direct investment (FDI) to create jobs.<br><br>3) For those people with excellent paper qualifications, you think they are fantastic? Ever wondered how come there are so many chinese and indian students aruond? They are not even the best of the best from their country but because they have such a huge population base to tap from, SG juz needs to attract the top 10% to beat our top pple here.<br>- Results are not everything. What matters is really possessing a commercially attractive skill which cannot be easily duplicated by someone else studying a textbook. (80% of what you learn in school is useless.)<br><br>4) The rise of our neighbours<br>We succeeded and progressed very fast in the past 30 yrs because of the incompetencies and size of our neighbours (namely Indonesia and Malaysia. Now there's China, India, and also globally). We have become too expensive as a employment base for most companies. We maybe able to attract the high end jobs, but what about the other jobs for the other pple who are not so technically n academically inclined? Not everyone in singapore can be a research scientist or banker etc. (Our neighbours are becoming more n more powerful already)<br><br>5) With increased competition, the weak companies will be forced to close down and relocate elsewhere. Only strong companies stay and strong companies only hire high end pple. How about our pple at the bottom? What's going to happen to them?<br><br>Conclusion<br>a) SG's high days are a thing of the past. We were at our peak in 1996 just before the Asian financial crisis and we were never able to get back to our full power again. We have too small a domestic market, we rely too much on export markets which make us vulnerable to external market conditions.<br><br>b) things will get tougher n tougher. you will have to work harder n longer for most people.<br><br>c) The income divide will widen. The poor will get poorer, rich get richer and the middle class gets the brunt of the tax effects. (Rich people own companies, SG government is pro-employer because we rely too much on them. If the SG government taxes them too much or has too much red tape, these employers will take theirbusiness elsewhere. So who do you think the SG government will listen to more? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> )<br><br>d) It's will be easier for one to be bankrupt. Just imagine paying all those loans and u lose your job? Bye bye... imagine your wife will run away too coz you don't have money to support her. - you don't eat with love, you eat with money. Money puts food on the table.<br><br>So what can 1 do?<br>a) Be globally employable. Don't just look in the context of SG. If you have an opportunity to leave for a diff exp, go.<br><br>b) it is not necessary to do what everyone else does to attain your dreams. going thru school and uni and then working is not always the best way. You may jsut end up like the rest. Work to your grave. Can you think of another way?<br><br>c) Be financially prudent. Invest in your financial knowledge. Know the different betw an asset and a liability. 99% of Singaporeans are assetless. your house is not an asset, neither is your car. They are costing you money. An asset puts money into your pocket, a liability takes money out. Don't be fooled.<br><br>In such trying times, it's no longer important to work hard n work smart. Now... it's all about opportunities. Some people can work hard n work smart but they'll be stuck like 80% of the people.<br><br>All the best,<br>From a concerned fellow singaporean =)</div>

Recently, SM Goh asks us to innovate. I think that is not enough. We have to really change every policy in Singapore for it to work, especially education. Our education system is not suitable for living in this globalized world. We need to change the education system in such a way that it encourages R&amp;D instead of memorizing facts only.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>True, true. The government only made the Singapore society and environment a better place to live in by ensuring that we have all our basics plus a bit of consumerism, in order to live well enough and survive.<br><br>As for getting richer, we really have to innovate.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I agree with that Singaporeans are basically "assetless", as in we have more depreciating assets (MP3 players, PCs, TVs, fashion clothings etc) than fixed assets that really grow money.<br><br>The most obvious is the car consumer policy in Singapore. COE is high, so is the fuel. So having a car is certainly something that burns someone's pocket, especially you are using it for luxury, not money-making business.<br><br>So the best and the most basic way to get richer is still saving money in banks. This saving habit has help Singapore tide through the worst storms, and it helped made Singapore's survival and success possible.<br><br>I think the most important things that made us stay in Singapore is definitely the peace with all our family and friends.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>reasons to migrate in singapore<br><br>1) i get to talk to my family and friends through msn and webcam etc. a great opportunity to demonstrate my competence in handling technology<br><br>2) i get to buy my own panadol and prepare my own wet towel, which i previously didnt get the chance to do so because mum always does it for me, no sense of achievement at all.<br><br>3) i get to have all the snacks to myself without my brothers comng to snuggle up to me and whisper all those gross things like "you are the sweetest sister in the world" and "if sister really really loves little brother, sister will give little brother her Mars bar" just so i will give him a bite of my fav choc bar.<br><br>4) i get to have the TV all to myself, without the brothers and mum all squeezing together in the living room and laugh and chat when watching the show.</div>
