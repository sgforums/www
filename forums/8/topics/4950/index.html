            <div class='col-md body'><br>I am a student currently studying in Australia. Recently I had this unpleasant thing happened to me. A girlfriend I had for 4 years left me for another guy. She is still in Singapore but was supposed to join me over here when this thing happened. That bastard who is her ex-classmate used the pretext of suffering from the loss of his GF to gain my Girlfriend sympathy and get close to her, knowing that she is already attached. I can't really talk to her that often due to cost in telephone bills and also I am separated by the long distance to be able to do anything of effect. I just want an opinion of you all whether what the guy did was moral wooing someone else GF?? What happened to male principles?? People gf cannot touched??<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry to hear about that lightningbolt. Firstly, I am VERY much against going after attached girls. Its not fair to the gal's bf and frankly speaking, I think guys who do so are SOBs. Unless there are valid reasons for me to act as such(the bf treats her badly or both parties agree that if they find a more suitable partner its ok) otherwise its a definite no-no.<br><br>All's fair and square before she's attached, but once she is then it would be like, "Hands off!" But seriously, since your gf has already left you, there's no point in going back after her. If 4 years of a relationship is not enough for her to stay commited to you while you are away, then I say forget it.<br><br>Its hard but its my POV.... there will be others with better advice   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Why?

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry about the loss Bolt,...but sad to say that most long distance relationships don't last...especially when ur still young...<br><br>Let's face it, when ur young, u want someone there for u..if they're not, u have to move on...or even if u don't want to, it will probably just happen...unless ur one of those lucky bastards who got a GF or BF who willing to wait...But I think that it's rare.  I tend to think that as u get older, ur more willing to wait for that special someone who is abroad.<br><br>I just found out that my GF's guy friend who went to study in Aussie...After a few months, he paid for her to go visit him, but hse ended up visiting everything and everyone else but him...not only that, she broke up with him...<br><br>It's a really sad thing now a days.  It also has to do with the fact that there are literally billions of fish in the sea...and being lonely can make people change quite drastically.<br><br>AS for the question of ethics...I personally wouldn't want to steal anyones GF away, but lets just say that it is very tempting to try because the guy isn't there.  He's no threat and can't defend the relationship...and usually the girl is probably lonely so getting close wouldn't be a problem.  I really can't say what's right or wrong here, but it happens very often and that's something that we ccan't change.<br><br>I used to hate guys who did this because I had a few GF that I loved stolen from right under my nose....but as I got older and a bit wiser, I began to realise that it isn't fair to make someone wait for u.  if they are willing to wait, then that's superb!!!<br><br>We can and have the right to ask, but we must also understand that they are the ones being left behind...and that feeling is worse and more lonely than the person who is doing the leaving.  Tho we may feel sad that we left the GF BF behind, it's much worse for the poor person left behind....just look at it this way...the person doing the breaking up is on a much better footing than the person left behind....True?  Yes...unfortunately.<br><br>So can we really blame anyone for taking our GF BF away?  We may get angry, but if we love them and care about them, then maybe we should consider understanding why they would get taken by another person...and in a way, we should be happy for them that someone is willing to take care of them.....<br><br>yes, an overly idealistic view of it, but u would have to be very generous and un-greedy to be able to do this...But love is greddy and we as humans find it hard to let go of people we care about...but then again, life moves on....and sometimes, we get left behind because we aren't around to do anything about it....<br><br>Maybe it's wrong for other guys to take advantage of this situation, but at this point in my life...I wouldn't hold it against them or my GF for leaving....<br><br>Just my view...but I'm sad for ur loss anyway...and I'm sure it must be extremely painful and especially lonely there a thousand miles away... where u have no hope of control over what happens from where u r...<br><br>Take care man.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bolt, it's real shit to read that your ex-gf got stolen.  The guy no doubt is a real bastard.  I definitely would never steal another person's girl.  It's really scummy for one to act like that!<br><br>But then again, it may not be entirely his fault.  Your ex-gf is responsble for it too!  It takes two hands to clap, rite?<br><br>Hey, see this as a learning experience.  Also, it's better to know that you ex-gf is such an easy person to be taken away now than later.  Hope you are not offended by the prior sentence.<br><br>Good luck in your next hunting!  Life goes on, buddy!<br><br></div>
