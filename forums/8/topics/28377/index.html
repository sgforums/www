            <div class='col-md body'>&gt;A FRENCH teacher was explaining to her class that, in French - unlike in<br>&gt;English<br>&gt;- nouns are designated as either masculine or feminine. A student asked,<br>&gt;"What<br>&gt;gender is 'computer'?" Instead of giving the answer, the teacher split the<br>&gt;class<br>&gt;into two groups, male and female, and asked them to decide for themselves<br>&gt;whether 'computer' should be a masculine or a feminine noun. Each group was<br>&gt;asked to give four reasons for its recommendation.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;The men's group decided that computers should definitely be of the feminine<br>&gt;gender because:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. No-one but their creator understands their internal logic.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;2. The native language they use to communicate with other computers is<br>&gt;incomprehensible to everyone else.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;3. Even the smallest mistakes are stored in long-term memory for possible<br>&gt;later<br>&gt;review.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending half<br>&gt;your<br>&gt;wages on accessories for it.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;The women's group, however, concluded that computers should be masculine<br>&gt;because:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1. In order to do anything with them, you have to turn them on.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;2. They have a lot of data but still can't think for themselves.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;3. They are supposed to help you solve problems, but half the time they ARE<br>&gt;the<br>&gt;problem.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;4. As soon as you commit to one, you realise that, if you had waited a<br>&gt;little<br>&gt;longer, you could have got a better model.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;The women won.<br>&gt;<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A man was walking across the road when he met the accident. The impact was on his head which caused him to be comatose for two days before he finally regained consciousness. When open his eyes, his wife was there beside him. He held her hands and said meaningfully : "You have always been beside me. When I was a struggling university student, I failed again and again. And sometimes, even my re-papers as well. You were always there beside me, encouraging me to go on trying..." She squeezed his hands as he continued :"When I went for all the major interviews and failed to clinch any of the jobs, you were there beside me, cutting out more adverts for me to apply..." He continued "Then I started work at this little firm and finally got to handle a big contract. I blew it because of one little mistake. And you were there beside me."<br><br>Then I finally got another job after being laid off for sometime. But I never seem to be promoted and my hard work was not recognized. As such, I remained in the same position from the day I join the company till now... And you were there beside me"<br><br>Her eyes brimmed with tears as she listened to her husband :"And now I met an accident and when I woke up, you are here beside me ... There's something I'll really like to say to you..."<br><br>She flung herself on the bed to hug her husband, and sobbing with emotion.<br><br>He said ..., " I think you really bring me bad luck..."<br></div>

I am getting married to the most beautiful girl in town. She lives a block away and her name is Susan."<br><br>After dinner, William's dad took him aside. "Son, I have to talk with you. Your mother and I have been married 30 years.. She's a wonderful wife but she has never offered much excitement in the bedroom, so I used to fool around with women a lot. Susan is actually your half-sister, and I'm afraid you can't marry her."<br><br>William was heart-broken. After eight months he eventually started dating girls again. A year later he came home and very proudly announced, "Dianne said yes! We're getting married in June."<br><br>Again his father insisted on another private conversation and broke the sad news. "Dianne is your half-sister too, William. I'm awfully sorry about this."<br><br>William was furious! He finally decided to go to his mother with the news.<br><br>"Dad has done so much harm.. I guess I'm never going to get married," he complained. "Every time I fall in love, Dad tells me the girl is my half-sister."<br><br>His mother just shook her head. "Don't pay any attention to what he says, dear. He's not really your father."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Men from Mars, Women from Venus<br><br>...The Difference...<br>Women have more imagination than men do. They need it to tell us how wonderful we are.<br><br>Women have their faults. Men have only two. Everything they say. Everything they do.<br><br>A successful man is one who makes more money than his wife can spend. A successful woman is one who can find such a man.<br><br>...The Style...<br>Men wake up as good-looking as they went to bed. Women somehow deteriorate during the night.<br><br>When women are depressed they either eat or go shopping. Men invade another country. It's a whole different way of thinking.<br><br>...The Workplace...<br>When a man gives his opinion, he's a man. When a woman gives her opinions, she's a bitch.<br><br>...Relationships...<br>Diamonds are a girl's best friend. Dogs are a man's best friend. Now you know which sex is smarter.<br><br>...Love...<br>Men always want to be a woman's first love. Women have a more subtle instinct: What they like is to be a man's last romance.<br><br>The only way to understand a woman is to love her - and then it isn't necessary to understand her.<br><br>To women, love is an occupation. To men, a preoccupation.<br><br>To be happy with a man you must understand him a lot and love him a little. To be happy with a woman you must love her a lot and not try to understand her at all.<br><br>...Marriage...<br>A woman marries a man expecting he will change, but he doesn't. A man marries a woman expecting that she won't change and she does.<br><br>Men marry because they are tired; woman because they are curious. Both are disappointed.<br><br>A woman worries about the future until she gets a husband, while a man never worries about the future until he gets a wife.<br><br>A woman will always cherish the memory of the man who wanted to marry her; a man, of the woman who he didn't.<br><br>There are two times when a man doesn't understand a woman - before marriage and after marriage.<br><br>...Husbands...<br>Only two things are necessary to keep one's wife happy. One is to let her think she is having her own way, and the other is to let her have it.<br><br>Married men live longer than single men do, but married men are a lot more willing to die.<br><br>Any married man should forget his mistakes - no use two people remembering the same thing.<br><br>...Wives...<br>Some husbands are living proof that a woman can take a joke.<br><br>Husbands are like cars: all are good the first year.<br><br>...The Battle...<br>A woman has the last word in any argument. Anything a man says after that is the beginning of a new argument.<br><br>...On Men...<br>If you women knew what we were thinking, you'd never stop slapping us.<br><br>Men are like animals, but they make great pets.<br><br>...On Women...<br>Can you imagine a world without men? No crime and lots of happy fat women.<br><br>Women have two weapons: cosmetics and tears.<br><br>Women may be the only group that grows more radical with age.<br><br>God made man before woman to give him time to think of an answer for her first question.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large">Rules Guys wish Girls knew</span>Please note...these are all numbered #1 ON PURPOSE!<br><br>1. If you think you are fat, you probably are. Do not ask us. We refuse to answer.<br><br>1. Learn to work the toilet seat. You're a big girl. If it's up, put it down.<br><br>1. Do not cut your hair. Ever. Long hair is always more attractive than short hair. One of the big reasons guys fear getting married is that married women always cut their hair, and by then, you are stuck with her.<br><br>1. Birthdays, Valentines, and Anniversaries are not quests to see if we can find the perfect present yet again!<br><br>1. If you ask a question you don't want an answer to; expect an answer you do not want to hear.<br><br>1. Sometimes, we are not thinking about you. Live with it.<br><br>1. Do not ask us what we are thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as navel lint, the shotgun formation and Nascar.<br><br>1. Sunday sports. It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides. Let it be.<br><br>1. Shopping is not a sport, and no, we are never going to think of it that way.<br><br>1. When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is fine. Really.<br><br>1. You have enough clothes. You have too many shoes.<br><br>1. Crying is blackmail.<br><br>1. Your ex-boyfriend is an idiot.<br><br>1. Ask for what you want. Let us be clear on this one: Subtle hints do not work. Strong hints do not work. Obvious hints do not work. Just say it!<br><br>1. We don't remember dates. Mark birthdays and anniversaries on a calendar. Remind us frequently beforehand.<br><br>1. Most guys own three pairs of shoes - tops. What makes you think we'd be any good at choosing which pair, out of thirty, would look good with your dress?<br><br>1. Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question.<br><br>1. Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it. That's what we do. Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for.<br><br>1. A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a doctor.<br><br>1. Foreign films are best left to foreigners.<br><br>1. Check your oil. Please.<br><br>1. Do not fake it. We would rather be ineffective than deceived.<br><br>1. Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. In fact, all comments become null and void after 7 days.<br><br>1. If you won't dress like the Victoria's Secret girls, don't expect us to act like soap opera guys.<br><br>1. If something we said can be interpreted two ways, and one of the ways makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one.<br><br>1. Let us ogle. We are going to look anyway; it's genetic.<br><br>1. Don't rub the lamp if you don't want the genie to come out.<br><br>1. You can either ask us to do something OR tell us how you want it done-not both. If you already know best how to do it, just do it yourself.<br><br>1. Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during commercials.<br><br>1. Christopher Columbus did not need directions, and neither do we.<br><br>1. Women wearing Wonderbras and low-cut blouses lose their right to complain about having their boobs stared at.<br><br>1. More women should wear Wonderbras and low-cut blouses. We like staring at boobs.<br><br>1. The relationship is never going to be like it was the first two months we were going out. Get over it. And quit whining to your girlfriends like THEIR relationships are SO MUCH better.<br><br>1. ALL men see in only 16 colors, like Windows default settings. Peach, for example, is a fruit, not a color. Pumpkin is also a fruit. We have no idea what mauve is.<br><br>1. If it itches, it will be scratched. We do that.<br><br>1. We are not mind readers and we never will be. Our lack of mind-reading ability is not proof of how little we care about you.<br><br>1. If we ask what is wrong and you say "nothing," we will act like nothing's wrong. We know you are lying, but it is just not worth the hassle.<br><br></div>
