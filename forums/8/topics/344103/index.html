              <p>Lots of bad service in Singapore:</p>
              <p>1) Hairstylist just cut the hair according to what they want and ignore the need and requests from customers.  some even quarrel with the customers when customers voice out.    Hairstylist sweet talk to customers to con customers, used free samples on customers hair for own testing and still charge full rates, cut a hole in the hair.  Such people are Peggy from Super Cut - Goldhill Plaza, Daniel from Chapter 2, Bugis, Kary from Mix Salon (a small neighbourhood salon).</p>
              <p>2)   Bad service from STarhub, Singtel and M1</p>
              <p>   Starhub knew that particular model of cable tv box not working effective still went ahead to issue to customers.  As a result, customers can't watch cable programme.   Technician came to check, confirmed this particular model has many sets returned because of defect.</p>
              <p>Starhub refuses to let customers terminate contract when both their GPRS and 3G internet broadband is giving lots of problems everyday.   They don't seem to solve the problem.</p>
              <p>Singtel overcharges bill.   The customer service of the Singnet broadband staff really suck.   Talked nicely to them but treat customers like shit.  Shouted at customers and upon request refused to pass call to supervisor or other colleagues when they can't help with the problem.</p>
              <p>M1 agreed to pay the balance bill paid upon termination in the next bill.  Instead, of paying the balance, they ask the customer to pay instead. </p>
              <p>3)    Sales staff - Discrimination against local customers.    Sales staff prefer to serve the angmo first before the local customers when local customers are there first. </p>

              <p>Starhub has very bad service. I remembered a couple of times I called Starhub up for the Internet enquiry, it took ages for them to get me connected to a person who could help me.</p>
              <p>I haven't really experienced how bad Singapore service is but I can tell you Australia has the worst service ever especially Telstra. I had a problem with my billing account of my mobile phone. I was on hold for at least 20 to 30 mins, they kept saying that currently they are alot of people in the queue please wait in the queue blah blah blah.</p>
              <p>Another one is TPG it's an Internet company. It has really lousy service, you wait for about 15 minutes and then you tell them your problem and they put you on hold for another 15 minutes again until finally someone talks to you. But the person that talks to you is normally indian. I can't understand their english, I am Australian myself so I understand english for sure. I am lost when those indians speak english, they either speak too fast or not clear.</p>

              <p>I do agree that Starhub's service sucks too. They take weeks or even months to solve a simple problem encountered by their customers, such as subscription of cable tv channels. Worse still, they will not initiate to contact customers. Thus customers have to call their helpline almost every single day until the problem is solved.</p>

              <p>Anyway, thanks for your comments aye. It's all true to a large extent ! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>

              <p><br>I encountered this problem when calling the HP helpline too. I think the company hires all filipinos. I had a super hard time understanding their english. And it was so sucky when the other party I was speaking to kept saying that I was speaking too soft when I was trying to tell her the problem I was facing, and she wasn't able to hear me. I got so frustrated after repeating again and again, hence said that I would call back again then. IMMEDIATELY, she said, "Okay then, thank you mam. I really couldn't hear what you were talking. Sorry about that." Since she couldn't hear what I was talking about............ She could hear that I said I was going to hang up! -.-</p>
