              <p><span style="font-size: normal;"><strong>Push Pockets in KL</strong><br><br>I am sure you all have heard of 'pick pocket'.<br><br>Now there is a new trend, 'push pocket' .     <br><br>A
                      few days ago a new type of crime has surfaced in town. It goes
                      something like this:- Somebody slips a hand-phone into your pocket,
                      sometimes it could be just a wallet with an identity card and a few
                      Ringgit. <br><br>A few minutes later, the 'owner' comes up and confronts you, the 'thief '. He makes a big commotion that you stole his stuff. <br><br>You,
                      caught unaware, are then pulled aside by the 'owner' for a settlement
                      you are intimidated and threatened that if you do not pay up, the
                      police will be brought in. If you pay up, this 'owner' will lets you
                      go. If not, the police are brought in. <br><br>Another strange thing is that, there always seems to be a 'witness' to the your 'theft'. <br><br>I
                      am told this often happens to foreigners at the Kuala Lumpur
                      International Airport (KLIA) or even at LRT trains. Given that you're
                      'guilty until proven innocent' as far as the Malaysian police are
                      concerned, I understand some poor people are in jail for these
                      'offences'. <br><br>At the KLIA, the 'owner' throws his hand-phone and
                      wallet with the few Ringgit notes into the luggage trolley of a just
                      arrived passenger. The drama unfolds a few minutes later. The real
                      culprits could eaily convince the Malaysian police to arrest the real
                      victim (if he has not paid up the 'settlement' demand). <br><br>This
                      is another form of extortion operating in broad daylight. They are
                      disgusting criminals who will do anything to rob and steal. The
                      sickening part of the whole scenario is that unless you pay the 'quoted
                      settlement' money, they will put you in real trouble by calling the
                      police. <br><br>The real culprit gets back his hand-phone and wallet
                      but the real victim (i.e. could be any one of us) is thrown into the
                      police lock up and charged in court. <br><br>So do be very careful, otherwise you may end up as a 'thief' as you have no way to prove your innocence. <br><br>Pass it on...let more people be aware of such things around them. <br><br>Geh Cheng Lok &amp; Co.<br>Advocates &amp; Solicitors <br>No. 20, King Street (Top Floor)<br>10200 Penang , Malaysia<br>Tel.

              "For the best of George Town, walk along Love Lane, Pitt Street, *King Street* and Carnarvon Street. Certain streets like Chulia Street and Campbell Street are best viewed in the evening, when they burst to life with hawker stalls and nighttime activities. Incidentally, some of the best hawker food are found on these two streets. See also the Southern end of Penang Street for a taste of â€œLittle India.â€� Along this street are several banana leaf rice restaurants and a Hindu temple.
