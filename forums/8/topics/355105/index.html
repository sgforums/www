              <p>Well.. i was on the train one evening on my way home. i was standing in front of an old lady. My friend and i were talking about problems that we encounter in school and how the sore throat had affected me for these few days. i coughed as i talked.</p>
              <p>the train reach ang mo kio station before this old lady stands up and scolded us about why we hated school and that i drink mineral water in the mrt!</p>
              <p>well... we were just talking about our school and i reckon many people will feel frustrated about certain things sometimes and would like to share. Plus, is it wrong to drink mineral water in the MRT???</p>
              <p>By the way, this is not the first time that i encounter such 'mishap' and i would like you to share about your's encounter and what you think about this incident! :)</p>

              <p>Sooo, you were not scolded for nothing.</p>
              <p>The old lady feels you should be thankful for school. Here in Singapore we take schooling for granted. In other countries education is taken seriously by the students themselves. It can be seen in the difference from the products of our state of the art schools (our students), and the wooden shack schools of villages of third world countries, who are now here as foreign talents. </p>
              <p>Its not what you talk about that dis her off, it your over all tone (negative, loud), body language (cough! cough! sound of phlegm), behaviour (bottoms up water bottle). Singaporeans talk loudly too, oblivious of others around them, and this is just as annoying as foreigners talking loudly. We can see others' flaws, but not our own. </p>
              <p>By telling you off, the old lady is honest. Those who see a flaw and keep quiet are not being honest. Granted that the old lady is not courteous herself in doing so </p>

              <p>Sooo, you were not scolded for nothing.</p>
              <p>The old lady feels you should be thankful for school. Here in Singapore we take schooling for granted. In other countries education is taken seriously by the students themselves. It can be seen in the difference from the products of our state of the art schools (our students), and the wooden shack schools of villages of third world countries, who are now here as foreign talents. </p>
              <p>Its not what you talk about that dis her off, it your over all tone (negative, loud), body language (cough! cough! sound of phlegm), behaviour (bottoms up water bottle). Singaporeans talk loudly too, oblivious of others around them, and this is just as annoying as foreigners talking loudly. We can see others' flaws, but not our own. </p>
              <p>By telling you off, the old lady is honest. Those who see a flaw and keep quiet are not being honest. Granted that the old lady is not courteous herself in doing so </p>
