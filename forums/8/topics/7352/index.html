            <div class='col-md body'>Singaporeans, I believe are generally quite tolerant. It's only a matter of WHO and HOW people practice their religion, because some people can get real irritating at times, or inconsiderate.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Happen to drop by, couldn't resist dropping a note after reading the thread on "Serving The Lord", a rather long thread I must add.<br>Generally, I believe Singaporeans are religiously tolerant as long as they don't discuss about it. It is some sort of a time bomb waiting to be unearthed. Once it is unearthed, *poof*, long arguments ensue, so I am not very sure how religiously tolerant that can be. Then again, I might be wrong.<br>I believe Singaporeans are generally not ready for open discussions on sensitive issues like religion, since many (I hope this is a generalisation), do not have open enough a mind to really think about other people's view. And that is also a reason why I believe the "Speaker's Corner" which is going to be implimented in I think six months time (??) will be doomed to failure. Many Singaporeans tend to take an extremist view on matters and reject all other aspects of the topic as irrelevant, impossible, pure balderdash. An object can be open to many interpretations, just like the bible, I read the bible, and there are many things I do not agree in the thread mentioned. Darwin's Theory of Evolution that was quoted, I think there seem to be some flaw somewhere too. But that is beside the point.<br>Religion is a question of faith, but one can't simply use faith to retort other believes. One has to accept that there are still grey areas which will slowly be clearer as time passes, and not just plug in any explanation and believe 100% that it is true. Using the most obvious example again, the books in the bible has been inspired by God, by written by the hands of Man, therefore it is inevitable that some parts of it might be ambiguous, misleading or even incorrect. Afterall, we are 21st human beings reading literature written down by people few thousands of years ago. Then again, this is my interpretation, and I believe there are other perspectives to this.<br>What is my point of all these yapping?? Let's see, while I gather my thoughts. Okay, religious tolerance. I believe that religious tolerance will only be possible the day when Singaporeans come to accept that there are grey areas, different interpretations and perspectives to everything. Which is simply the reason why there are discussions right? I mean, if everything is clearly defined as black and white, I see no point of further discussions.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>I talked too much, got to go back to my work now.

            <div class='col-md body'>it seems that the saying that never debate politics,religion or sex with someone else is correct as i feel that singaporeans are quite tolerant about religion as long as no one trys to influence them to convert etc etc  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">))</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, this reminds me of a story. I knew of two families who lived next to each other. The kids of both families had fun playing with each other everyday. Despite the very different backgrounds of both families, they were still able to get along very amicably. However one day, one of the kids began to talk about how his father was the greatest father he had. Proud he may seem, and deservedly so, for his father had indeed provided much for him. However, this led to the displeasure of the other kid, for in his eyes, his father was the greatest father one could have too. So he began to boast about what a great father he had too. So the harmless boastings turned sour and a fight ensued. The last I remember, the two kids were still on heated terms. Sad huh. Was that necessary?<br>And oh yah, before I forgot, Colette if u can see me, hi to you too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Going with somewhat the same vein as Revelations said, I've a quote here from the notes of Moby's latest albumn Play.   I didn't know he is a christian albeit one with rather liberal left wing views.<br><br>"Fundamentalism (of any kind) troubles me.  The world is too big &amp; too intricate to conform to our ideas of what it should be like.  In my experience I've found that most fundamentalists aren't so much attached to their professed ideologies as they are to the way in which these ideologies try to make sense of a confusing world.  But the world is confusing, and just because we invent myths and theories to explain away the chaos we're still going to live in a world that's older and more complicated than we'll ever understand.  So many religious &amp; political &amp; scientific &amp; social systems fail in that they try to impose a rigid structure onto what is an inherently ambiguous world.  I m not suggesting that we stop trying to understand things.  Trying to understand the worls can be fun and at times helpful.  But if we base our belief systems on the humble assumption that the complexities of the world are ontologically beyond our understanding, then maybe our belief systems will make more sense &amp; end up causing less suffering."<br><br></div>
