You will never have the good feeling over any opposite sex. Hence, you will never have a good relationship.

            <div class='col-md body'>For the gentleman: It is advice <strong><span style="color: blue;">not to paste any sex related material like sex related posters etc. in your bedroom</span></strong>. You will properly lose your "yang" energy if you face these materials too much. The more "yang" energy you have, the more you can attract opposite sex. For man, it is very important to have the "yang" qi with you.<br><img src="http://www.michaelsharp.org/books/bookoflife/images/yin-yang.jpg"><br>In Feng Shui and Astrology, than stronger the man has his "yang" qi, and the stronger the lady has her "yin" energy, the "yin yang" gathers and balances the romance life.<br><br><img src="http://www.celticcastles.com/castles/loughcutra/img/fun_green.jpg"><br>In Feng Shui, colour is also an important aspect in romance related topics. For instance, <strong><span style="color: blue;">green colour is always not advice to paint on the wall of your bedroom</span></strong>. You will never succeed to make a man/lady love you no matter how hard you tried. Or rather I say, you better give up on him/her.<br><br><img src="http://www.bbonline.com/md/carmelcove/pix13.jpg"><strong><span style="color: blue;">Paint your bedroom wall with light and bright colours</span></strong>. Light sky blue colours will create a peaceful and stable relationship. Light pink or violet colour will create a romantic and loving relationship. Pale off white colour will create a fresh and successful relationship.<br><br><img src="http://www.barlandscottage.co.uk/brendans%20red%20bedroom.jpg"><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Never paint red colour </span></strong>in your room unless you are getting married. It ends your chances to find a suitable life-partner.<br><br>There are always things not advise to place in a bedroom. However if you follow to my tips above, you properly will have a better relationship sooner. Feng Shui starts with the feeling. If you feel very comfortable to place something in your room, then it's okay. If you got a feeling of uneasy, frustration, confused or worried, you properly got an objective. It's always strongly advise to check out more with your local Feng Shui adviser.<br><br><img src="http://www.multi-store.com.au/images/range1.gif"><br>Last, it is also worth to <strong><span style="color: indigo;">clean your wardrobe often</span></strong>. Throw away unwanted clothes, shoes or towels often. Clear at least 3 to 4 times a year. It somehow means that <strong><span style="color: blue;">a brand new relationship </span></strong>you will only have only if you can throw away the old/bad or unsuccessful one. Don't just leave everything in your wardrobe for thousand years and just don't bother of clearing up your wardrobe. You properly end up tones of rubbish inside. You might as well choose to remain alone forever in your life. Your heart is filled with too much objectives that bothers you. That's properly the reason why you always feel bothered or frustrated or even get jealous easily whenever you heard the news that another of your good buddies is getting married soon. SO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? CLEAN UP AND TIDY UP YOUR WARDROBE TODAY! FIGHT FOR YOUR OWN HAPPINESS NOW!</div>

Remove it if you can. Allow that space at the main door to be free and clear.  The chi (energy) rides with the wind and will collect all the smell of those shoes and slippers into your house causing sickness.<br><img src="http://images.google.com.sg/images?q=tbn:OLdFjiLqVLsJ:ryugraphix.com/shodo/images/large_chi.jpg"><br>Ch'i then travels about in your house looking for water to stay but if there are no water fountains or fish tanks, then the Ch'i will be dispersed by wind.<br><br><img src="http://lodgis.com/photos/ul/ap/1423/P/H13.jpg"><br>There should be <strong><span style="color: indigo;">no television sets in your bedrooms</span></strong>: If you cannot get rid of that habit then after watching the television cover it with a plastic table cloth. Remember it has to be plastic and not simply cloth.<br><br><img src="http://www.apartmentres.com/uploads/photos/582.bedroom%20-%20mirror.jpg"><br>There should be <strong><span style="color: blue;">no mirrors opposite your bed or at the side of your bed</span></strong>. Mirrors opposite the bed can attract a third party to the relationship. Therefore, do not place mirrors anywhere you like and especially in your bedroom.<br><br><img src="http://images.google.com.sg/images?q=tbn:WA70ehw1YeMJ:www.aspencountry.com/aspen/assets/product_images/product_lib/31000-31999/31140.jpg"><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Place an indoor water fountainin your home</span></strong> , position in a favourable area to attract whatever you want in your life.<br><br><img src="http://images.google.com.sg/images?q=tbn:tk6WZ-LQ2nAJ:http://www.roystory.com/images/soccer_fish_jules/images/fish_bedroom_tank.jpg">If you already have a fish tank in your house, be careful. <span style="color: indigo;"><strong>A fish tank placed correctly can bring about greater fortune</strong></span>, as you will tap on the "Divine Water Dragon's Den". But if you tap wrongly, it can cause you to have lawsuits, bankruptcy, work pressure, troubles and problems. If you noticed any of these after placing the fish tank for approximately four months, shift your fish tank to another location.<br></div>
