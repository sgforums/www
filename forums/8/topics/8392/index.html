            <div class='col-md body'>Dear all,<br><br>Originally, I wanted to post this in Faroutnews, because the response there might be more interesting. But nevertheless, I thought what I am writing would not be something good. So I decided to flood the gates of Chit Chat with my long essay again. If there is someone whom I should dedicate this piece of essay to, it would be MayaJade. It was out of a recent totally different conversation which gave me the inspiration to write such an essay. If u people think that it is good enough, you can always crosspost it to FON for me.<br><br>I start this essay about the era which we lived in. The kind of uncertainties, threatened with things which could wipe out the entire human race. Well, if you think that nuclear holocaust is not the worse case scenairo, there will be always exist a deadly virus Ebola, and we have global warming, a huge asteroid roaming around us, and even war can break out anytime, if one idiot would press the button. I was thinking of the recent Camp David talks on the affairs of Israel and Palestine, and somehow it lead me to make a relation of our values system to the era which we lived in.<br><br>So, let me use a more simple way of explaining of our era. We lived in a time where people are very mobile and can move around, thanks to globalisation. Because there exists new modes of communication ranging from telephone to even ICQ or IRC, so people are trangressing the boundaries and we have more new ways of living our lives. The problem with advancement in civilization is that it progresses with good things as well as brings in problems. As George B. Shaw once put it,"Science never solves a problem without creating ten more." Similarly, technology has the kind of double-edged weapon which can go both ways.<br><br>So, coming back to the question where I begin from. Which era would I want to live in? I would prefer to live in the old days of Victorian age or medival times (the days of Camelot), or in the Tang Dynasty where literature and enlightenment are reached. Because a hand written letter is always more sincere than an electronic mail. Why did I pick this kind of time? Maybe I find the values in that time appealing and perhaps, the world is not complicated as before. I have done both good and bad in my life, and when I look back, I still find, finding my own principles and integrity means I have some value or worth to live. I could degenerate after doing bad, but I learned to understand life consists of a series  of trials which mould me, and then it could mean to struggle against adversity.<br><br>One could always argued against me saying that the moral code is a set of values which are set and conditioned by the society. I agree with that, but what I am trying to argue here, is that society is degrading because our world is being exposed to more and more possible dangers induced by the way we deal with the environment and people, and we begin to condone more and more sins. Chivalry, or perhaps, Junzi (the Confucian code of gentleman) is dead. I don't abide by that kind of code, but I already struggling with my own values against the tide of the world. To survive is to adapt, and sometimes, I have to yield when I make political decisions. So can we still have honor in the way we see the world? I still believe in honor, even I lost it before in a time. We lived in an age where anti-heroes are worshipped and you see poor kids in a high school in Colorado got shot to death, because of some nice hollywood movie, where u see a static model of Keanu Reeves holding a gun and shooting around to kill. It reflects the way we view society. So, I might be old fashioned or too principled in making such a claim.<br><br>So, at the end of the day, I appeal in this essay to inquire into our values. Can we really condone adultery or some clown who blabbers about beding his wife's sister? Can we condone people who do bad deeds but glorified by gangster movies?<br><br>Well, I hope to hear opinions, perhaps, if very least, tell me which era you would want to live in.....<br><br>Have a good day.<br><br>yours sincerely,<br>The Prodigal<br><br>------------------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights. However, love is not about finding someone to relieve you, but love is about you devoting your heart and soul to love that someone, even if you know that someone do not love you the way you do."<br>- Prodigal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For me,i would love to live during the Tang dynasty,that was the era when the China was at her peak and the development of chinese culture was also quite high,not to mention the absense of any major wars and it was quite a peaceful period in chinese history.<br><br>Humans are born to always view the bad side of anything eg you notice that when an accident happens on the road,the cars will always slow down to a halt to gawk and stare at the scene while i bet if in it's place was just some beautiful roses growing there,the cars will not stop at all.Humans always prefer to see the bad in other people rather than the good,is this the result of upbringing and the values of our system or issit inborn?No one cansay for sure.By looking at the bad side of other people,we kind of assume a superior attitude as in "wah lau eh,he can sleep with his sister in law,heng i not that type of loser".By looking at the negative aspects of someone's character,we kinda enhance our own character,so that's why people prefer to see something destructive and negative rather than constructive and positive,heehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Sheesh,i must be blabbing a lot,must be the morning air,ahaha  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>When you were born, you were hungry and everyone around you was full.

            <div class='col-md body'>1.  History repeats itself.  (The first time as a tragedy and the second time as a farce.  )<br>2.  There is nothing new under the sun.<br><br>I think that our time has its cycle and if I can only see the whole picture most probably it's just some huge circle.  So do I want to live in a particular age and time?  No preference.  There will be same misery, different cause, same effects.  I may meet some wonderful personalities but I will definitely miss others living in other time or space.<br><br>I won't say that our time is more evil than any other time.  They did burn witches and widows.  I do not have any knowledge about the Tang dynasty, but I suppose you will need to be in a specific place for you to be able to enjoy all those glory.  I mean what's the whole point of living in The Sun King's time if you were a slave or the lowliest servant with a bad back and no teeth?<br>So back to my original point, I will need to specify a place and family to born into to be able to enjoy more of life and if it is just that, I can live right now right here in this place being the most loved, smart,  beautiful daughter of a tycoon.<br><br>Finally, what to say about my values then?  They can seem disgustingly flexible sometimes (when they bother to be present at all) but that's the way I like them to be.  And honestly getting the experiences that help reshaping them is already a reward in itself.  It's great to be able to look back and reflect that I have openned up more despite how my surrounding is like.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i havent given the topic much thought till now. Given a chance to choose the era i would like to live it i would choose the american gold rush. Let me explain my view.<br><br>many times we choose to live in peaceful times and so call perfect society but if there is anywhere u can go. Hope can bring you there. Times were hard then but the were hope in many of the immigrants. Ask me to stay in tang era or mabe even a perfect time in the future, but if the world is lack of hope then is it worth struggle my 70 yr of my life to try to pass by.<br><br>As for values i believe it is pass down from generation to generation and culture to culture. then the mogolian for example, they go to war bcos they feel it is an hournor to fight in a battle, to have victory. Samurais have the feel of shame in defeat they kill themselves. what abt the red indians then have to train and dig out the hearts of man. they respect their enemy then they dig their heat out and eat the heart. to do this is by no means no mean cruel but a sign of respect for their enemy. if they dont respect them the feed them to the animals.<br><br>in this context i felt it is not important wat u do but wat is ur intent.<br><br>------------------<br>Outing info <a href="http://expage.com/outing" rel="nofollow">http://expage.com/outing</a></div>

If we think about it slightly more clearly, I am actually not interested which era I would want to live. Perhaps, my individual choice do not influence how my real life going to be, but my individual choice to what how I should adapt to this world.<br><br>Unfortunately, being realistic, we all have to understand that we must live our lives for now. What is important is the values of our society. I have repeatedly tried not to use the word morality. What I am trying to say is that because we are relaxing the tight system of our value system, and the question is how do we draw the line? No one here could provide me an answer to why we can condone a joker who sleeps with his sister's wife even if it is a mistake? So, if you think about what is being said, then we should just be thinking of how we can start having proper values to teach our children in the future.<br><br>yours,<br>Prodigal<br><br></div>
