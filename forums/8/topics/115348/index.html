            <div class='col-md body'>I just reached home and had experienced the most embarrasing thing that happened to me inside a bus as long as I can recall.<br><br>I was riding on those long buses and was getting off. I was at the back and the door opened for me to get off. You know that in these buses there are two exits, one in front and one behind.<br><br>The bus was not crowded. Only a few people standing. I was the only one alighting from the back. Then for some reason I don't know what the bus driver was doing and he only switched on the Ez-Link reader at the front exit. Not at the back. (If the driver's not the one who's supposed to be controlling the switch, forget about this thread)<br><br>I was like, super stunned for like 3 seconds. The door was opened but the reader still was not on. In order to prevent the door suddenly closing and driving, I quickly dashed to the front exit, tapped my Ez-Link card and got off. I seriously don't think that I do not look like someone not alighting at that bus stop at that time. What was the driver thinking?<br><br>Now, come to think of it. Almost every year for the past few years, we keep talking about transport fee hikes, to cover rising operating costs, higher diesel prices, training blah blah blah. And now, I'm experiencing something that I don't think I shall experience.<br><br>I don't expect bus drivers to greet me when I come on the bus. I don't expect them to drive fast and reached my destination quickly. I don't expect the air-conditioning to be at optimum temperature most of the time. I don't expect the driver to brake smoothly everytime when they are stopping. I don't expect the driver to wait for me if I'm running to catch the bus. All I want is for them to do the simple things correctly.<br><br>Seriously, are there problems with the training of bus drivers? Are there health checks for people who want to be bus drivers? Are the bus drivers being worked too much? Are they having enough rest in between drives? I don't want to be in a bus accident one day due to causes like bus driver heart attack or bus driver too tired. Dying this way is not worth it.<br><br>Alas, I'm too poor, cannot afford to pay for driving test, let alone buy a car. Everyday, I have to take the same bus service. *sigh* I'm at the mercy of these bus drivers.<br><br>Today, I look like a clown. Tomorrow, I'll become a joke if it happens to me again.<br><br>P.S: Sorry for the long post. I just want to vent my frustrations out.</div>
