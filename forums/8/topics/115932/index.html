Whatever for?<br>'I find that the evidence of Mr Chen is very confusing... very unreliable.'<br><br>The trial also heard that Mr Yeo offered to let Mr Chen and the woman stay overnight when he did not have the $100 he had agreed to pay them for cleaning the flat.<br><br>Mr Yeo insisted at his trial that he had never let them in.<br><br>As for the appeal being heard only after his release, DPP Low said that the process had 'moved very fast' after Mr Yeo filed his arguments last Thursday.<br><br>But the CJ said: 'I am very, very displeased with the proceedings here. I will call up every fellow in the Subordinate Courts... What the hell went on here?<br><br>'It is incredible, utterly incredible.'<br><br>He said he was not blaming the DPP, but the appeal was now academic.<br>He allowed the appeal but said he was very sorry that Mr Yeo had served his sentence.<br><br>'This is an incredible mix-up. People say the courts are very efficient. I don't think so lah. I will find out who is to blame, what went wrong,' he said.<br><br>News of the case and the CJ's remarks are already a talking point in legal circles.<br><br>Lawyer Edmond Pereira said: 'I've come across acquittals on appeal while the accused persons were on bail or serving sentence but never in my three decades of practice, have I heard of a conviction being quashed after the accused person has served his sentence.'<br><br>The entire episode has left Mr Yeo feeling like a 'victim of the system'.<br><br>Speaking to The Straits Times after returning to a sparsely furnished three-room flat in Toa Payoh Lorong 1 yesterday, he said: 'I feel miserable, yet relieved that it is finally over. It's a bad experience. I don't think anyone would have wanted to go through what I went through. It was a traumatic experience.'<br><br>The first thing he did after his release from jail on Saturday was to have a long shower and sleep in his own bed.<br><br>Mr Yeo lives alone and stays indoors most of the time because of his 'medical condition'.<br><br>A volunteer from a Christian group comes by with food every day and occasionally gives him some money as well.<br><br>On his plans, a still unsteady Mr Yeo said: 'I don't know who will help me. I wonder if there is a victim assistance programme... I want to get a job or pick up the pieces and move on with life. I keep asking, why me, why me?' -- ADDITIONAL REPORTING BY TRACY SUA<br><br>(WHO'S NEXT TO BE IN JAIL?!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> )</div>
