            <div class='col-md body'>I read in Streats yesterday, a letter to its forum page by a JB Muslim man.<br><br>In it, he stated that females to cover their heads in religious activities is compulsory for Christians and he quoted from the bible 4 verses in the book of Corinthians to emphasise the point.<br><br>Then he goes on to say that nowhere in the Quran can he find any verse that said that is compulsory, although it did mention about being modest and covering of the bosom.<br><br>If you read today's Straits Times, the page before the forum page, a Muslim lawyer actually declared that the Tudung is a fashion statement and she traced the history of the Tudung and its evolution till today.<br><br>I can only regurgitate what I've read and cannot comment cos I dunno the Quran that well.<br><br>Infact, if both the writers are correct, then even if the child reaches puberty age, it is not compulsory too although it is good to do so in the name of modesty.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> DuH<br><br>------------------<br>yeah yeah yeah, boogie woogie spit it out at <a href="http://www.my77thstreet.com" rel="nofollow">www.my77thstreet.com</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Generally, the sensationalism generated by the whole affair is a big <span style="font-style: italic;">HOOHA</span>. I personally feel that the issue is not really one to be contended with by Singapore society at large.<br><br>Although the issue of racial integration comes into play, we shoud not forget that Singapore is country based on secular laws, hence a secular state. Our daily lives are governed not by religion bu by the democracy of our government and the laws we agree upon.<br><br>Yes, our lives are also poignanted with glibblets of religious practises. But we must see the issue from a secular perspective.<br><br>Not wearing tudung = not respectful of islam?<br><br>Is this a personal view or a general view taken by all muslims??<br><br>Sometimes, religious law takes too much of a upper hand, especially when it wields its sword over those who are forced to abide it when they were born. Whatever happened to freedom??<br><br>Anyway, that is a contenscious issue. Seems like being born is an given inherent right to be governed by your past heritage.<br><br>Perhaps the tundung issue will blow over as easily as it started. Perhaps the government will change its stand. Perhaps, Malaysia will ask for more Islamic Freedom in our country.<br><br>More seriously, what path do we want to take?<br><br>Secularlism &amp; Religion?<br><br>P.S (The issue is religion, not race)<br><br>------------------<br><strong>I cOnSiDeR MySeLf aN ExPeRt tOmAtO gArDeNeR sInCe aLL oF mY FrIeNdS TeLL mE I hAvE tHe mOsT CoLoUrFuL aNd sWeEtEsT tOmAtOeS.</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Life is too short to bother with tasteless tomatoes."<br></span></div>

(there may be more, but let's just take these examples for this case)<br><br>There are plenty of other Malay primary school girls who do not wear tudung, so are they less faithful to their religion?<br>I certainly don't think so.<br><br>A public school is different from the religious school, Madrasah.<br>A public school consist of students from all races (except some traditional Chinese schools which only have strict Chinese intake). If in the first place, you enrol your child in the (public) school of your choice, it is only right that you respect and obey the school rules. After all, the children are learning to be disciplined in school. School handbooks and talks are given to parents during the child's enrolment (usually in December before the school year), and there are principal/teacher-parent sessions for parents to know more about the school system and the regulations.<br><br>Back to the issue, did the parents ask their daughter's opinion?<br>A 7-year-old kid, happily goes to primary school, excited about making new friends and learning new things, is suddenly the focus of reporters' cameras and stares of others in the school. I'm sure they were scared, but they were not allowed to show it (as instructed by their parents, i suppose). In one clip on the Ch 8 news, I saw the little girl clutching her dad's thighs tightly and avoiding the cameras and reporters who were trying to interview them, and she is struggling to put up a straight face. Why do the parents want to put their innocent daughter through this?<br><br>The big question again.<br>Not wearing tudung = not respectful of islam?<br>Obviously many Muslim leaders have clarified and the schools were kind enough to retain the names of the girls in their list and welcome her back to school anytime she is in prim and proper uniform.<br>School time is only 6-7hours, and it is a public school the parents had decided to send the girls to, does it hurt to do away with the tudung for that short period of time? After school, there are still plenty of time to be "respectful to islam".<br><br>[This message has been edited by FireIce (edited 20 February 2002).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by FireIce (edited 20 February 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>guys.....these issues have political agenda in them. right or wrong doesnt matter to us, the commoners cos in the end we just have to follow the system.<br>regarding the wearing og tudong, it is not compulsory for girls under puberty age to wear the tudong. islam requires the muslim women of puberty age to cover themselves leaving only their face and the two palms so as not to attract unwanted attention from ogling eyes. however, the parents do have the right to train their children to wear it at an early age so it will be easier to wear it later on.if we were to extend the issue to sec sch, where most girls reach puberty, wat do u think of the response will be? i gurantee u it will be more extreme cos its compulsory for them to wear it. u may ask y all this time no one bring up the issue and suddenly this issue came out?<br>the reason is my frens, in every religion, there r bad and good practicioners. the gd ones carry out it dutifully while the bad ones just close one eye. issit wrong for pple to carry out their religion dutifully?issit wrong for christians to go to church and pray while the others stay at home on sunday? issit wrong for sikhs to keep their hair when most of them now have crew cut hairstyle?.....<br>all i'm trying to say is that pple shld be allowed to practise wat their religion requires them to do...since this is a democratic country and 1 thing for sure is that i'm against the way this issue was brought up by the families concerned...<br>neway i don expect u all to agree with me but i just wan to clarify some matters  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>ps: FI, the word fateha actually got  religious meaning,so if u wan to scold the guy, scold him but dont make fun of the word<br><br>------------------<br>to live is evil...=)</div>
