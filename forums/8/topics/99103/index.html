This is the wrong approach.'<br><br>Four in five people surveyed know about the existence of a consumer watchdog, though only one in 10 of these has ever gone to Case for help.<br><br>Many consumers also do not know about the CaseTrust scheme, which has accredited 650 outlets which meet fair trading standards, such having a clear refund policy and a means to resolve disputes.<br><br>Just 18 per cent have ever seen the CaseTrust logo in shops, and only 13 per cent of those knows what it means, the random survey of 414 people aged 20 and over shows.<br><br>Mr Seah said he was 'not surprised' given that the logo was relaunched in April. 'We will continue putting advertisements in major publications over the next few months to try and increase the logo's visibility.'<br><br>The survey concludes that Singaporeans - true to stereotype - are 'prudent' shoppers, with most showing careful buying habits such as checking goods for defects or testing them.<br><br>For purchases over $500, four in five would compare prices between shops.<br><br>Housewife Betty Chua, 37, is one, revealing that she can spend up to a week searching out the lowest price for big-ticket items like computers or televisions.<br><br>The survey also found that one in five people did not know that the goods and services tax is 5 per cent, while only half have ever returned defective goods to stores.<br><br>Mr Seah said that now Case is aware that consumers know so little, it will hold more seminars on the fair trading law and highlight cases via the media.<br><br>Dr Teo worries that most people cannot understand the technicalities of the Act.<br><br>'Bring it down to coffee shop frequency,' he said.<br><br>'For example, tell the old folks not to sign anything if they don't understand. Teach them to take the form home and check with the family and friends.'</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>WHAT should you do when a shop charges you for repairs to your mobile phone that it had not told you about? What compensation can you claim if a salon damages your scalp after colouring your hair? Can you demand for your money back if an airline which warns you upfront about its no-refund policy changes your flight without telling you?<br><br>Case study<br><br>ONE woman who went to a salon to have her hair coloured found her scalp bleeding the next day. She immediately sought help from a dermatologist, who said that the strong chemicals used had aggravated her sensitive scalp.<br><br>She returned to the salon, and upon confrontation, it refunded her the $103 she had paid for the colour job.<br><br>However, she wanted the salon to pay for her medical expenses of $128 too.<br><br>She lodged a complaint with the Consumers Association of Singapore, which then contacted the salon. The watchdog body later found that the salon had closed down, but managed to trace the owner, who agreed to pay $50 in compensation.<br><br><strong>CONSUMER TIPS</strong><br><br>1. Even if the shop has closed down, you can check with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority to see if the company's records are still active.<br>2. If necessary, seek professional help and get medical certification to back up your claims.</blockquote></div>
