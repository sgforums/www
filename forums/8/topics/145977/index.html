            <div class='col-md body'>A summary of my interpretation and understanding about jobs, based on my and friends' experiences, newspapers (esp these 2 days Today) and TV:<br><br>1. Never change job unless you have a new job secured (signed). True as gold rule.<br><br>2. If you are above 30, forget about changing careers unless you don't mind being a taxi driver, security guard or cleaner.<br><br>3. If you are above 35, pray hard every day that you will not be retrenched.<br><br>4. Never ever be loyal to your employer. NEVER. 10 % of your time should be spent on a constant lookout for new jobs. 40% on handling office politics and 50% on real work.<br><br>5. Fuck it with the bullshit that temp and contract jobs are good for you.  Most HR are myopic. They don't consider anything less than 1 year as real job experience but they will consider 3 contract jobs in 2 years as job hopping. If die die must do contract job, do not go for those less than 1 year.<br><br>6. If you are planning to migrate, please plan your career very carefully. Not all skills are needed by foreign countries.<br><br>7. Avoid working for SMEs at all cost. Any companies that are Sesdaq listed and smaller are SMEs. They have pathetic pay and benefits and almost no career path. If you are in one now, you must remember rule 4 at all time.<br><br>I hope the above will help the youngsters and others. Please add or comment.</div>

I exaggerate to emphasize my point of "great care and thinking is needed before becoming an entrepreneur".<br><br>In Singapore there is no way back for most failed entreprenuers unless their family is rich.

Read the contract terms carefully. For my company contractors they are getting more pay but they lose out on benefits like paternity marriage MC dental leave etc.... Contract with more money is good for people who forgo benefits but not so ideal for family man who has other concerns besides work related matters. So I guess it is a trade off. Sometimes contract based can means travelling ard and for some family man it can be quite hard to arrange cuz of family commitments.<br><br>Conclusion: Contract works best for single who want more money but it is not good for family man who has other concerns  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
