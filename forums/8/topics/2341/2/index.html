Pai Fu, I really admire you for your sacrifice. Guess few girls can do that for a guy.<br><br>Well, Jap^Apple. It's this guy that you love. You must have a nice talk with him one day but if he still behave the same way, you got nothing you can do also unless you want a breakup with him to find a better guy. Else in the mean time just like what Doom had said, you can actually go out and make more friends. Of course, shun from those old friends of yours as you had wishes but find those true sincere friends out there. One thing to take note, not all "proper" or "educated" pple are true and sincere to their friends. In fact, it is these kind of pple that most likely to make use of other pple. Sometime, even among your ah-lian frn maybe of some whom you had neglected can be a true good friends with their sincere heart to help you. Think about it. Don feel so miserable just because you think you are alone in this world. Open up your circle of friends.<br><br>As for your bf..sigh i have no comments. You made your choice just like my friends devilgal. So either change him or bear with it. As usual, not all guys are like him. I hate soccer also. So don always have that feeling that all guys are of the same kind.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Kyo23 (edited 10 January 2002).]</div>

Let him know the lack of communication problem between the two of you. Explain to him how you feel and the importance of communication between couples. But you have to be diplomatic when you say these to him if not he will mistake you as restricting his leisure time watching soccer.</div>
