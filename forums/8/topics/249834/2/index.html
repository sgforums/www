And then it proceeds on to other forms of markets. Like oligopolys, competitive markets and so on.<br>The telecom market began with monopoly (Singtel). The television too was monopoly (mediacorp). Bus services was monopoly. MRT was monopoly. English Newspaper was monopoly. Do correct me if I am wrong =) But as u can see, they eventually progressed into competitive markets. And now we have affordable internet, hp, fixed line services.<br>Monopoly is indeed unhealthy for customer but when he isn't left with a choice he can't do much then DEMAND for better prices and more companies offering the same services.<br>Do you think Starhub is being very advanced in having its smart tv consoles and flashy interface? Trust me, its about time they provided in services. In India, there are services which are far more advanced then that of Starhub's and they cost a fraction of the cost. In the end customers benefit and the market is also making money.<br>Customers are MEANT to be picky and demand things. Thats the customer's job. You don't expect a customer to go "Oh?! Only $100 for this? Too cheap la! I really appreciate it! Can I pay $110 instead?" Cheap or not, customer WILL demand the same product for $90 as long as he can say money.<br>And by the way, comparing Vietnam's library system (or any other system) to that of Singapore's is totally ridiculous. Singapore is a microcosm in itself. You have keep in mind about how small Singapore is and thus how easy it is to maintain. Lets say you have 50 libraries in Singapore. Going by the size, Veitnam should probably have 5000.<br><br>Anyway, I am not typing all this to "bring" u down or anything. I am just typing so that people will read and see my point of view too =)<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

U mentioned that there are poor people who can't afford cable tv. Did you know that there are poorer people in India who CAN and do afford cable tv including premium channels like Star Movies, HBO, Cinemax etc?? Yes all legally.<br><br>What we pay for tv here is ridiculous. On top of that we never get a "live" feed exactly. There is always a 2 to 4 second delay between the actual live feed other countries receive and what we receive in Singapore.<br><br>And Starhub has ingeniously made us pay for the world cup. Both for soccer and cricket. Did you know how much we paid for "Pay per view" Cricket World Cup? Almost $110! How much profit do u think Starhub made with Soccer World Cup? I don't know too, but I can asure you that it is in millions.<br><br>All thanks to their monopoly over the cable tv market. Just let it become more competitive and you will see prices halved in no time at all.<br><br>Still expect us not to complain?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote>Well as to that, I think you need to take in consideration the population of the particular country. India for example, has a huge population that is many the times of Singapore. I am not sure how the cost of leasing those cable station works but for example. If India cable provide lease a particular chan for say $50k and it has 1 million subscriber. And likewise, SCV has to pay $50k for the chan and it only has 100 000 subscribers. So of course the Indica cable provider can afford to charge their subscribers cheaper.<br><br>Also, the India cable subscriber can afford to sell their advertisement slots for much more than SCV will be able to as it is targeting more audience. Hence, maybe the revenue they gain from those advertisements is more than enough for them to telecast the sports chans for free.<br><br>Again, all this is speculation but it makes sense to me :p</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Im really amazed by some people here who can stand all the family dramas that's been goin on for years &amp; years.<br><br>They just need to change some actors (But sometimes they dont even bother to change), change a theme song &amp; the title of the show, edit a <strong>little bit</strong> of the plot lines &amp; some people will go all excited over it. "NEW SHOW NEW SHOW!!" -_-''<br><br>At the end, you all will say, hey i've seen this show somewhere &amp; then realise it's almost the same as the previous clone family dramas  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> [/b]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>as one of the person above has said, india cable vision to its people may indeed be cheaper than singapore..<br><br>however, have people look at the reasons why it is cheaper?<br>perhaps the reason do not exist in singapore?<br>singapore may not be good in some areas, but it is also good in other areas, how do you then decide whether singapore is good or bad.<br><br>do you expect a country to excel in all areas?<br><br>many people in life or internet complain from a narrow point of view. they do not analyse the situation deep enough and think shallow.<br><br>if people want to offer argument, first must analyse the problem first well. sometimes there is no problem in the first place but people choose to see it as a problem, then they start arguing and finding reasons to support their argument.<br><br>i confess i do not have profund knowledge myself of how the cable industry works, it fairness and all these. but i know that in internet forum, most people just rant off their opinions without evidence and feelings gather in bits and pieces and just keep arguing their point.<br><br>there is little accuracy in their belief. internet forums is also famous for fish market argument where people argue many different points and still think that they are on the same topic.<br><br>mediacorp and starhub is being discussed and they are separate in some sense. i agree that healthy dicussion is encouraged and that you just have to filter a bit and wait for more reasonable arguments by occasional good forumers...<br><br>if i would to think abt the price fairness of SCV right now, i would say that at around 40 bucks(roughly) for basic channels per month.. it is not too expensive.<br><br>you all want companies to enter cable provider industry and compete with starhub to pull down the prices and bring quality to customers... ok fine...<br>how are you going to convince companies that they should come then??<br><br>give more concrete analysis to these comapnies. the ranting made down here is not going to encourage companies to want to compete with starhub.<br><br>if they are going to compete in the future, it would be because they have find it really worth it and not because of the rantings down here. whether more competition is realy going to come i cannot say.. but i dun think fro singapore, it will necessary have to happen for the case of cable vision...<br><br>lets just wait and see..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>$110 buck are oso money, if 2 million people pay for it, how much is that? Change them to coin is enough to crash 100000 people. Don't forget they oso charge for voting for idol, project superstar, registration fee for applicant for idol plus their investment in newspaper, starhub and many other investment. u realli think they don't earn so much?<br><br>Nowaday, the drama produced are really very bad unlike in the past. Last time, low budget still can produced good drama with good script. Now, family drama with duplicated story, uncreative and boring.<br><br>I used to watch local drama but now I don't watch anymore. they used to telecast new movie on every Saturday night, and during public holiday, new show is telecast. now they don't, what I see is repeated show and movie for more than twice. I rather watch DVD. or else they would censor here and there in taiwan varieties from 1.30 hrs to 1 hrs to fix the time slots.<br><br>Actually, this is not complaint, it is people who voiced out what they think. No good mean no good, good mean good, it just a simple answer. Keeping silence and having doubts is even more stressful. I remember I email to them suggestions but nothing was change. I think have to wait until next life. Haha</div>
