            <div class='col-md body'>Nine in 10 guys give me second look on Orchard Rd<br>GORGEOUSNESS MEANS BIGGER BREASTS<br><br>By Angeline Song asong@sph.com.sg<br><br>TO this sweet young thing, being gorgeous will help to keep her career options open.<br><br>And she's no bimbo.<br><br>Miss Rufin Wong is a second-year civil engineering undergraduate at Nanyang Technological University.<br><br>She has done her calculations and she believes that $2,000 to enhance her breasts is a good investment.<br><br>'I've heard of a few female engineering students who had difficulty finding jobs after they graduated,' explained the cheery, 1.7m-tall student who scored Bs and Cs for A-level Physics and double Maths. So she might fall back on her looks for a job.<br><br>'I want to gain experience working in different fields before deciding on my career. It's part of my plan to keep my career options open.'<br><br>And one of those options is modelling - something she's had an eye on since she was in secondary school.<br><br>Inspired by fashion magazines, she picked up her first modelling assignment at a hair show after her junior college exams. This was followed by modelling jobs at computer or car fairs which paid between $15 and $30 an hour for eight hours.<br><br>To help propel her into a bigger league, she signed up for the bust enhancement programme at the PrettiSlim salon in Ngee Ann City last August. She paid monthly instalments of $200, from money she saved up, working during her school holidays, in offices and pubs. She also gave tuition.<br><br>FROM C TO D CUP<br><br>Within six months of therapy, she claimed, she went from a size C cup to a size D cup.<br><br>'I felt that having bigger breasts would make my figure more proportionate, and improve my chances in modelling,' said the chatty undergraduate, who appears down to earth and at ease with herself.<br><br>'It is my personal preference, and I am not harming anybody. I know there are people in school who say unkind things behind my back, but I just ignore them.<br><br>'I am young only once and I intend to make the best of it.'<br><br>She said she found out about non-surgical bust enlargement programmes from modelling friends.<br><br>'At the salon, I told them I wanted my breasts to be bigger, firm and round, not saggy.'<br><br>Salon manager May Cheng said: 'Rufin's certainly wasn't the case of an ugly duckling being turned into a swan, but just taking someone who looked good already, and wanted to look even better.'<br><br>Miss Rufin Wong, 21, said that at first, it felt funny to have therapists massage her breasts: 'It felt a little bit funny at first, but it was okay after a few sessions as it's always the same female therapist doing the sessions and I got used to her.<br><br>'In fact, it felt so comfortable and relaxing, and the environment was so cosy, I fell asleep during treatments!'<br><br>Miss Wong is just one among many women who want to look gorgeous. While her bust enhancement programme did not require surgery, The Straits Times recently reported that more teenage girls are going under the knife in their quest for beauty.<br><br>Oft-quoted cosmetic surgeon Dr Woffles Wu claimed he gets at least 10 new teenage clients a month, twice the number four years ago. While Dr Martin Huang has operated on about 150 teens in the past five years.<br><br>The most common requests are for double eyelids, nose jobs and surgery to tuck back protruding ears.<br><br>Miss Wong said her enhanced bustline gave her the confidence to submit her photographs to that male bastion of flesh and flash, Singapore FHM magazine.<br><br>She was selected to be one of eight girls for a feature last December creatively called Bikini Heaven. This carried a poster-sized photograph of her in a green, floral bikini.<br><br>'I believe my chances of being selected by the magazine soared because of my bigger boobs,' said Miss Wong.<br><br>'I love my body and my breasts.<br><br>'Nine out of 10 guys give me a second look when I walk down Orchard Road!'<br><br>You go, girl!<br><br>Miss Wong said that her mother, a housewife, and father, an administration officer, know that she has had her breasts enhanced, and that she does part-time modelling.<br><br>So does her boyfriend, a hotel lounge piano entertainer in his 20s, whom she has been seeing for over a year.<br><br>'They trust me,' said Miss Wong, who lives in a four-room flat with her parents and older sister.<br><br>'They know I am doing this to earn money - partly to pay for my school fees and books, and to gain experience. I take on modelling jobs only during the holidays or at the beginning of school term. I want to prove to my parents that I can take care of myself.'<br><br>So far, she hasn't been doing too badly in handling unwanted advances.<br><br>'Some men get the wrong idea because I am a friendly person. I just push them away or walk away,' said Miss Wong.<br><br>'One photographer even asked me whether I wanted to 'do more' after the shoot - and I immediately said 'no' and walked off.'<br><br><img src="http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2003-12-14/aibust-112448.jpg"><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Do non-surgical methods work?<br><br>DOCTORS say that there is no scientific proof that creams and oils, massage or massage machines can give you bigger breasts.<br><br>Dr Yong Chee Kong, breast surgeon at Mount Alvernia Medical Centre, said in a previous interview with The New Paper that the only medically proven method involves surgery.<br><br>He had said that creams and such work on the skin, rather than the glands. There is no medical evidence that what is applied to the breasts can help glands grow, he said.<br><br>But clients such as Rufin Wong insist otherwise.<br><br>Miss Rufin Wong claimed that after 22 sessions of therapy, which included having her bust massaged with special oils by a female therapist and a breast machine, her breast went up a cup size. But this could not be independently verified.<br><br>Ms May Cheng, PrettiSlim's salon manager, claimed the botanical extracts used in their programmes have been used in some cultures for thousands of years.<br><br>'Take fenugreek, for example,' said Ms Cheng, who graduated with a Bachelor of Science in an Australian university. 'It has been used by Middle East harem women for thousands of years to improve their bosoms. The seeds contain compounds that increase healthy breast tissue.<br><br>'With due respect to doctors and researchers, modern medicine and scientific research have yet to catch up in some areas, not because they are slow, but because scientific proof needs such rigorous testing. There may be a time lag.'</div>
