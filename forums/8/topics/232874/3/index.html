            <div class='col-md body'>While everyone is yapping about how good/cruel the death penalty is, did anyone consider the fact that before you even fly into Singaporean airspace , the warning to hang over drugs is broadcast over the airline system? Basically that guy could have ditch his drugs in the toilet system and just get jail for a less than minimal amount of drugs .<br><br>He had a choice, people . He made a choice to risk smuggling drugs and therefore risking his own life. Why should Singapore make a concession for the choice he made? The death penalty is meant as a deterrent . Obviously this guy didn't heed the deterrent and that is his fault. Alternative he could have took was to traffick drugs over countries without a death penalty.<br><br>It is almost like seeing a rattlesnake (Singapore) which can kill him (nigerian drug trafficker) , hear it rattle a loud warning ( i.e. airplane broadcast system about death penalty for drug smugglers) and then ignore the warning and get bitten to death (i.e. HUNG) . Tell me whose fault is it? Rattlesnake or the person who chose to tempt fate?</div>

Most of us just saying that abolishing the death sentence isn't practical. Even if we didn't want it, we'd want a better alternative which is none.<br><br>Deterrence is a much better option IMO<br><br>Look at countries which are riddled with drug problems. They don't have a death penalty system but more of their own citizens die from drug abuse. Drug dealers there don't fear jails. Some even still run their drug cartels while in jail which they relay info to their lackeys.<br><br>Do we want that? Do you want to come home and find your kids next time shooting up? Or even worse lying in a pool of their own vomit probably drowned to death?<br><br>Sure hanging maybe somewhat morbid but it was meant as a deterrence and not a means of killing people wantonly.<br><br>All those people who think Singapore is out for blood and all that obviously don't think practically and very one sided arguments.<br><br>If they want to get angry with us, let them stamp their feet like 5yr olds til they find another distraction to keep them busy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I didn't say Death Penalty stops drug abuse here. We all know Singapore has drug users. We know a certain percentage of drugs make it thru to our shores.<br><br>But like the report said. Overall Decline over the years. That itself should be indication enough to slowly stamp out drugs.<br><br>Anyone dealing in drugs is not ignorant nor is innocent. By knowingly doing such things as runners,dealers,etc they clearly are not innocent.<br><br>If people CHOOSE to knowingly engage in recreational drug use. its their own death sentence. Being poor, ignorant, depressed, etc as an excuse just doesn't cut it as there are many more people who are like that who are not into drug use.<br><br>I mean if you're not into drugs there is no reason for you to have them at anytime.<br><br>So Karma is a moot subject since no one is technically innocent. And there is no real proof of a afterlife or even a celestial being at all.<br><br>Like all the arguments i've heard about abolishing the death sentence, none of  the hippies can give a reasonable alternative.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by circleofwinter:</div><div class="quote_body">some of you say those drug traffickers deserved to be hanged.

THAT, is the constitutional side of things, which I'm not so inclined to discuss as it serves no purpose here anyway.<br><br>Now, on to the moral perspective - drug trafficking, while widely used for pernicious purposes, basically causes harm only to those who make a conscious choice to consume them (for whatever reasons be they to escape from reality or succumbing to peer pressure). To suggest drug lords and traffickers are guilty of their victim's predicament is thus no more viable a suggestion as suggesting a knife manufacturer should be implicated should someone commit murder using the manufacturer's knife (surely, this scenario cannot be an accident!) - that, in essence, is where I'm coming from which you've obviously failed to comprehend. And no, my stance isn't fact and hence needs no consensus or approval from anyone - it's just an opinion which ranks right up there as sensibly, if not more so, as yours.</div>
