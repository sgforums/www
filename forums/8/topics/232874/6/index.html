(.....) I'm not contesting the fact on whether narco-trafficking should be legalised, but rather, why should it - at least, beyond reasonable doubts and accepted as a consensus to a vast majority - be the most serious crime by a mile. Evidently, it's not rocket science to suggest narco-trafficking is not viewed as the most serious crime in many countries - quite honestly, narcotics pale in comparison to other crimes like murder in most countries - and clearly, that tells a story on its own.<br><br>As a matter of fact, I never tried convincing you narcotics shouldn't be taken seriously from a legal perspective - that said, I just don't believe it comes anywhere close to being the most heinous crime imaginable by any stretch of the imagination and that's just my opinion. So what's your fuss about, really?<br><br>Try telling me those drug addicts(people who made a conscious choice to get involved in that stuff) you encountered deserve a chance at life more than people who suffer through consequences that arose beyond their control![/b]</blockquote>Okay, this is turning out to be quite the mudslinging fest..<br><br>I do not think Walesa's being unreasonable.<br><br>While trafficking of illegal drugs is a serious crime, it's not nearly as serious as murder - I'd say it's around as serious as rape.

I might like to point out your speed reading needs improvement - I said that I am ok with your views on them making a conscious choice.  Once anyone chooses to consume heroin on a regular basis , they get addicted .<br><br>When they are HIGH , they HAVE NO MENTAL CAPACITY and may choose to sit down in their own wastes or commit a crime.  Hence I said public nuisance . Illicit drugs are a crime in itself.<br><br>Growth/Production and Possession of an illicit substance is a crime - the fact that any addict once HIGH  lacks sense of wrong or right . Owning a knife or a car is not unless you CHOOSE to commit a crime.  Which part did you not comprehend?<br><br>There is also another difference to cars, knives VERSUS illicit drugs - Quality control.<br><br>Let me also enlighten you on the quality controls - they are imposed on car and even knife manufacturers . If the knife falls from the handle and stabs you in the toe , you have the right to suing the manufacturer for damages . Illicit  drugs have no quality control - no one has an idea of what it has been mixed with - whether with chalk powder (seen addicts have embolism due to that) or even a couple of hundred toxins which are not meant for entering the veins. </strong><br><br><blockquote><br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Originally posted by fymk:<br><br>I would love to consider your experience dealing first hand with drug addicts and their families or maybe your vast experience in drug control policies internationally and nationally.

[/b]</blockquote>Although my experience is not on drug control policies , <strong> I do have the experience of dealing with drug addicts and their families as well as teenagers who took drugs for the first time only to end up as a vegetable due to a reaction. </strong><br><br>I was a nurse in Australia, I seen drug overdoses and kids who tried it and get a bad reaction. I seen a drug addict so desperate for heroin , he threaten to stab a colleague with a needle. I seen enough of drug addicts .I seen a kid think the bed was a cloud and he tried to fly from it since he thought he was a bird. Want to hear more? I have seen a man who was stabbed 10 times by a drug addict on high who wanted his wallet . <strong> These are just some of the examples of the direct and indirect victims of drugs </strong><br><br>I do not see cigarette smokers threaten to stab anyone with a needle if they do not have a smoke.<br><br><strong> Yes I do have problems coming to terms with the need to free drug traffickers when they do inherently makes the community more dangerous. That is why I am a firm supporter of the death penalty for drug trafficking even though I might disagree with the Government on other policies. </strong> My opinion is as good as any.<br><br><strong>Maybe  staying in Singapore where you are priviledged  not see drug addicts lying about wasted or trying to hustle or rob you,  must have blinded you to the societal problems of drugs . </strong><br><br>Go read on the effects of Cocaine , Heroin and MDMA ( aka Ecstasy).

You've enough problems trying to make a case for what you perceive to be seemingly intolerable and unacceptable views I have for drugs on its own without dwelling on politics. It may be slander to you, but it's freedom of expression to me. So if you can't live with that, we could always start a seperate thread to sustain the political aspects of this discussion...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by fymk:</div><div class="quote_body">I see you have conveniently neglected to enter what the details of no. 1 and no. 2. I might like to point out your speed reading needs improvement - I said that I am ok with your views on them making a conscious choice. Once anyone chooses to consume heroin on a regular basis , they get addicted .<br><br>When they are HIGH , they HAVE NO MENTAL CAPACITY and may choose to sit down in their own wastes or commit a crime. Hence I said public nuisance . Illicit drugs are a crime in itself.<br><br>Growth/Production and Possession of an illicit substance is a crime - the fact that any addict once HIGH lacks sense of wrong or right . Owning a knife or a car is not unless you CHOOSE to commit a crime. Which part did you not comprehend?<br><br>There is also another difference to cars, knives VERSUS illicit drugs - Quality control.<br><br>Let me also enlighten you on the quality controls - they are imposed on car and even knife manufacturers . If the knife falls from the handle and stabs you in the toe , you have the right to suing the manufacturer for damages . Illicit drugs have no quality control - no one has an idea of what it has been mixed with - whether with chalk powder (seen addicts have embolism due to that) or even a couple of hundred toxins which are not meant for entering the veins.<br><br>Although my experience is not on drug control policies , I do have the experience of dealing with drug addicts and their families as well as teenagers who took drugs for the first time only to end up as a vegetable due to a reaction.<br></div></blockquote>Yeah, so when they're HIGH, they lose their mental capacity to reason and will thus lose the plot and act in a manner that compromises the interests of others. Granted, so are you telling me they should be absolved of whatever blame that arises AS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THEM MAKING A CONSCIOUS CHOICE TO GET HIGH? That, in essence, is the thrash you're espousing in pinning the blame(at least, the gravity of the crime drug lords are purported to be committing) on the drug traffickers/lords. The fact remains drug addicts are merely paying a price for a conscious choice they made - and why on earth should drug lords shoulder the lion's share of the addicts' predicament lest the latter has been force-fed with drugs? <strong>The point remains, you haven't addressed the issue of why drug lords/traffickers warrant being treated as the most pernicious criminals known to mankind(and for the upteenth time, although admittedly unaided by your inability to comprehend simple logic, the question here surrounds a matter of why drug trafficking should be regarded as a crime more pernicious than any others, and not whether it should be illegal)?</strong><br><br>And why should quality control come into the picture of this discussion? Since when does quality control ever come into the picture of an illegitimate trade? If you choose to talk about quality control, why not try extending your argument by selling me the diatribe that drug lords should well be charged on the count of tax evasion too since they profit without paying their dues? What bollocks are you on about QC, really?<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by fymk:<br><strong><br>I was a nurse in Australia, I seen drug overdoses and kids who tried it and get a bad reaction. I seen a drug addict so desperate for heroin , he threaten to stab a colleague with a needle. I seen enough of drug addicts .I seen a kid think the bed was a cloud and he tried to fly from it since he thought he was a bird. Want to hear more? I have seen a man who was stabbed 10 times by a drug addict on high who wanted his wallet .

My opinion is as good as any.<br><br>Maybe  staying in Singapore where you are priviledged  not see drug addicts lying about wasted or trying to hustle or rob you,  must have blinded you to the societal problems of drugs .<br><br>Go read on the effects of Cocaine , Heroin and MDMA ( aka Ecstasy).
