            <div class='col-md body'>Wa lau... tis has become messy... Just wanna make a few points<br><br>To those who wanna make a statement about "god children" and "god creation" tat is why we should not kill people, I think tat is BS. Tis is because some religion have a reputation of carrying out mass massacre for their religion. Do they consider "god children" etc argument then ? Nope. If u talk about london or US and their complaints, I think it is BS itself. Tis is because they attack Iraq and kill so many people and they consider it as a "necessary evil". They even bomb areas where they knew there r innocent people and children residing in it just to clear out some of the fighters. They r effectively giving death penalty to these poor innocent people without a trial or reason ! Who r they to say tat singapore shouldn't practise death penalty after a trial with concrete evidence and he even admitted to the charge ?<br><br>About Nigerian aspect, obviously he had to be hanged. He is carrying more than 700 grams ! Tat is more than 45 times the aount of death penalty ! Tat could possibly satisfy all the drug addicts in singapore for a year ! If he is successful, he don't need to work for the rest of his life ! If we let him go lightly, then every nigerian will transport drugs to singapore for the money.<br><br>Talking about being framed, or blackmail etc and the person is stupid and do not know drugs, I have to say one have to understand how the law works. If he is being framed, he have to try to prove it. Otherwise tat is too bad. All offences can have the possibility of being framed. So we don't punish everybody ? The only consolation is tat if u manage to prove u r being framed, the person framing u will get the full blunt of the law plus more. Wat if u r being threathen with your life ? Very simple, u have to prove u r being forced to carry out the task, and u can get away free or face a much reduced sentence. It is not an offence to commit crime under threats of life or crime which have death penalty. Talking about stupid or ignorance, it is useful only if they can prove it without a doubt or show medical history. But tis is hard to prove most of the time and rightly so because anyone can claim ignorance.<br><br>About the problems of heroin,<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroin" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroin</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Side effects<br><strong>Severe:<br><br>Respiratory arrest, seizure, coma, death<br>Spontaneous abortion<br>Cardiovascular &amp; Respiratory:</strong><br><br>Lowered heart rate<br>Slowed, shallow or ineffective respiration<br>Eyes, Ears, nose, and mouth:<br><br>Dry mouth<br>Pupil constriction<br>Gastrointestinal:<br><br>Nausea<br>Vomiting (protracted)<br>Constipation<br>Urinary System:<br><br>Urinary retention<br>Musculoskeletal:<br><br>Analgesia<br>Ataxia<br>Neurological:<br><br>Analgesia<br>Physical dependence<br>Psychological:<br><br>Anxiolytic<br>Confusion<br>Euphoria<br>Somnolence<br>Addiction<br>Skin:<br><br>Itching<br>Flushing/Rash </span><br><br>It is really feeding poisonous substance to people.

Note the word ' associated '. In epidemiological terms , those famous cohort studies do not establish a causal effect only an associative effect. Just that politicians and policy makers choose to INFER in the way that smoking causes lung cancer. No one has ever done a randomised control on smoking which can prove that smoking ACTUALLY CAUSES lung cancer or heart disease because it is too unethical. Look at the actual studies, words they use are strongly suggestive , strongly associated .

I am not playing to win in this argument - I am just waiting to see how many insults Walesa can throw at me besides his usual vocabulary of "imbecile, idiot etc" . None of you did manage to point out anything except focus on one miserable point .....OHHhh hanging is so evil .  </blockquote>If you actually read my posts, i highlighted many reasons why we should abolished the death penalty for drug trafficking, citingmany examples like the nigerian i mentioned and whether they knew the consequences of action, the possibility of gettingsabotaged where its hard to prove one innocence, the flaws of the judical system, the possibility of backlash from other countries<br>and another forumner highlighted the recent nigerian case, where even the judge conceded the nigerian might not know that he was carrying drugs.Even if you do not agree with me, at least don't make false accusations. <strong>No where<br>did i mention or focus on only one point -  which is oo.. hunging traffickers is so evil and leave it just at that.</strong> Yet another random baseless accusation? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I already mentioned to Ignatcius, even if someone is pissed at you, they might not tell you straight in your face.  Your australian colleagues do not equate to the whole aussie population and i don't even consider you as a singaporean.<br>Last i checked, singapore does not recognize dual citizenship. Why choose to keep your singapore passport and call urself a singaporean when you obtain australian PR and intend to stay there for good?  there is no guaranteed way<br>of knowing whether australian are still not pissed at singapore and the execution of nguyen do not play a part in influnceing some of the decisions they made. Its like saying, if your boss fire you, do you think he will say that he fire you because he simply doesnt like you right in front of your face? I could also say the same for say, NS in singapore. And i could say, singapore is a small country with no resources to mention and therefore, we shld abolish NS since we will not be invaded and I am sure many forumners here will be quick to rebut this point. If thailand could get angry because of a visit by thaksin, who is to say we will not suffer any backlash in the future? Proof<br>that you can predict the future and read people's mind and show us that we will never suffer a backlash from other countries in the event of executing one of their countrymen then i will believe you.<br><br>http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/pm-warns-of-nguyen-fallout/2005/11/27/1133026330296.html<br><br>http://radar.smh.com.au/archives/2005/11/boycotting_sing.html<br><br>After 12 years, I dumped Optus yesterday when buying a Blackberry from the local Telstra shop. The Optus rep tried the standard "we'll match any offer," but he was speechless when I said the move was a political protest against Singapore's status as the world's most prolific executioners in per capita terms.<br><br>He then tried to say that Optus was separate from the Singapore Government. Not true buddy, the government owns 62.7%.<br><br>Other potential targets for a consumer boycott include hotels (the ANA in Sydney and the Park Hyatt in Melbourne), apartments (Australand), flights (Singapore Airlines), shopping (the Queen Victoria Building in Sydney) and the Singapore Government's vast energy sector interests in Australia.<br><br>At last, a reason to fly Qantas instead of Singapore Airlines.<br><br>by then the damage has already been done<br>[/b]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To circle of sand<br>Off the track we go.<br>Permanent residency is by no means citizenship.<br><strong> EVEN Singaporean permanent residents are allowed to keep their country's citizenship i.e. Malaysian or indonesian. </strong> Just  shows how much you understand  the differences between permanent residency and citizenship. One you obtain a stamp on your passport - the other you obtain the passport of the country. I have only 1 passport - Singaporean with a valid Permanent Residency Visa. So what the heck are you sprouting about?<br><br>I have the right to criticise certain policies and I do it within reason , so hush ...until my cpf money is out and my citizenship is surrendered - I am still Singaporean. There are good things and bad things about Singapore but I am <strong> NOT about to hammer Singapore like Walesa does. </strong> Do you have some problems with overseas singaporeans acquiring permanent residency?<br><br>I still like Singapore but I just don't agree with certain current and specific government policies and I do feel that Singaporeans should be taken care of first rather than foreigners . With the taxes I have paid into the system and CPF they use - HELL YEAH I have a right to speak!<br><br><strong> Back on track we are: </strong><br><br>ROFL<br>As for the rest of the so called affected relations and the impacts of bilateral relations between a country who carries out the death penalty vs one who doesn't , stay tune for Indonesia as they are going to shoot 2 australians for drug trafficking. Australia is going to be busy with Indonesia - but I do not see much appealing going on.<br><br>You imply so seriously that Singapore is going to be boycotted. Well yes my colleagues are not representative but the Morgan poll is as representative as it gets. 47% supported Singapore's move to hang Van , 46% objected and 7% unsure. No one is going to boycott Singaporean businesses or Singaporeans over some hanged and convicted criminal .<br><br>Likewise as you quoted that guy who made the stance on boycotting Singapore - he is not representative of the population. Well there are more reasons not to get Singaporean products - some Australians like to support Australian made , THAT IS IF THEY CAN AFFORD IT. If not , they still go for cheapest .<br><br>And by the way if Optus shares did drop much - it is because Temasek discovered they overpaid by 10 billion - this was wayyyyy long time before any execution. As for electricity - yeah yeah - people go for the cheapest offer. No one gives a cahoot except the rich and self-righteous  who can afford to pay a premium.<br><br>Have fun!</div>

Ask any doctor about case control and cohort studies  if they are cause and effect studies .  Smoking studies are mostly cohort studies. Anyone worth their salt will tell you those studies are correlational studies - they infer only strong associations - again those strong associations are based on a balance of probabilities between the exposure to a certain substance and a disease. The risk of acquiring a disease is  related to the exposure of the substance but may not be a cause of the disease. And as with any research - there are external factors which will affect the outcome.<br><br>Not many people will dare talk about criticising smoking studies because it is contentious and political but all who learnt epidemiology will tell you cohort studies are just correlational.<br><br>Any reputable doctor will tell you Randomised controlled trials are the best way to prove cause-effect relationships .Absolutely NO Smoking studies in humans have been done the RCT way.</div>

Comparing the effects of smoking versus illicit drugs - time and time again - I said it was comparing a jackfruit to a durian.<br><br>Illicit drugs out in the streets are detrimental due to the variable purity and quantities of toxins the illicit manufacturers placed into it. It is ingested by many methods - mostly through oral or venous route and  the inhalation route for pot.

            <div class='col-md body'>Jumping in at a very late stage as I haven't been on these forums lately...<br><br>fymk, we all know the differences between smoking cigarettes and consuming heroin.  But it does not appear that you have addressed the more pertinent question of why the "supplier" (more like courier really) should bear the ultimate penalty for a harm that the consumer voluntarily inflicts upon himself.<br><br>Yes, each country is free to legislate what they will.  But there are good laws and there are bad laws and we are all free to scrutinise and comment, particularly when the law involves taking away human life.  Just because it isn't your life hanging on the noose doesn't mean you should be indifferent to it [if your response is "what about the lives of the drug addicts?", then please answer the question in the above paragraph first].<br><br>It appears to me that the justification for imposing the death sentence is just to control the supply side of a larger social problem.  There is no moral retributive dimension to it.  Therefore, the death sentence for drug trafficking is premised purely on policy, devoid of any principle that punishment should be commensurate with the crime.  Is that morally legitimate?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another thing that irks me is the double standards in place here.<br><br>The rapper 50 cent started out as a trafficker.  On one hand, Singapore has no qualms promoting his music and portraying him as a star in our media.. then on the other hand, we put a regular Nigerian boy <strong>to death</strong> for doing exactly what 50 cent used to do, for exactly the reason why he did it - to make money.<br><br>If we consider drug trafficking to be such a henious crime, why do we then encourage adulation of a person who is obviously proud of his past success as a drug trafficker (and has even made a  movie out of it)?<br><br>Now that 50 cent is rich and no longer needs to traffick, he's "ok"?  <strong>So does that mean it's ok to get rich thru illegal means as long as we're not caught..?  And that Singapore will welcome the rich and their money regardless as to the means of which the money was obtained?</strong><br><br>I worry for Singapore.</div>
