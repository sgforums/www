Why should playing "a word war" with someone whose views are as myopic as humanly imaginable even remotely endorse my intellect? I'm still trying to make sense of what you're saying(to no avail admittedly, given the myopic reasonings which are far from balanced and sensible), mind!<br><br>Your last sentence just drives home what you've struggled to prove all along - granted, but if I were mugged by an armed robber or subjected to a botched kidnapping attempt, I too would clamour for the death penalty for robbery and kidnapping. So what's the fuss about drugs being that big a deal(ie.being more serious than robbery, kidnapping or other forms of serious crime)? If anything, that more than illustrates how you've done nothing besides championing a cause on the basis of your "grand" experiences. So where's your sense of perspective on matters if you were so "tolerant" of divergent views?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by fymk:</div><div class="quote_body">Don't twist my words the other way - there are people who feel that the drug penalty is appropriate and there are people who don't.

So what's the drivel about you trying to tell me about my BS views with examples that are effectively a bigger load of BS? And since you're on the issue of consensus and argue that, Singapore's death penalty imposed on drug traffickers is a reflection of a widespread consensus that people support such harsh measures, so what's so hard about you coming to terms with the fact that more people are subjected to constitutions which do not mete out the death penalty for drug traffickers than those that do? By extension, it's merely a reflection of a larger consensus on a macro scale that more people on this planet do not support the death penalty for drug trafficking than those that do. So am I twisting your words or are you simply overlooking the subtle point you've been so forcefully and vehemently trying to drive home?<br><br>Sure, you've had your experiences and I'm sure you've seen so much you probably know what constitutes the most pernicious vice in society that your views are irrefutable - in fact, just about everyone else who disagrees must be an inexperienced sod.

It is my view. If you feel my view is BS - that is your perogative.

Whether they maintain their mental capacity or not is a moot point. I can also say cigarette smokers cause more harm because of non smokers that inhale smoke from the cigarettes.

Whether they are rebellious or not is again, a completely moot point. I was rebellious too, yet i don't go and do harmful things when i know it  has no benefit to me, only harm just for the sake of looking cool, which is imo, the most stupid reason that exist in this world.

If Singapore is, then it will be a sad day. Remember there are other countries like Malaysia and Brunei which uphold the death penalty for drug trafficking too.<br><br>As for the so called backlash ....When they hung Van - did Australia lynch me? No. Did they boycott Singaporean businesses in Australia - No. Did the public really care save for the few of his friends and supporters - No. Even the war veterans protested and politicians walked out when they attempted to hold a minute's silence for his death. <strong> The basis for the walkout - HE IS A CRIMINAL AND IT IS AN INSULT TO THOSE WHO DIED IN THE SERVICE OF AUSTRALIA </strong>.

Do you?<br><span style="font-style: italic;"> A survey by Morgan Poll released on 30 November 2005 showed 47 % of Australians believed Nguyen should be executed, 46 % said the death penalty should not be carried out, and 7 % were undecided. </span> Oh wow , not a 100% objected.<br><br>It is on the Australian principle that they have to protect a citizen of theirs from the death penalty and I respect their principle. It is on Singapore's principles that it is a sovereign country has to carry out its laws. I did also raised a concern about how the Misuse of Drugs Act in regards to its definition but I still support a mandatory death sentence . Just because the news tell you Australia is making noise doesn't mean crap - bilateral ties will go down and come up again.<br><br>If you want to worry about bilateral ties and backlashes between country - go worry about Temasek and Shin Corp's issue in Thailand.<br><br>Oh yeah the flight route was an objection because of the economics involved with Qantas - Australia has a right to protect its air routes and Australia is protective. If they let SIA take the route- Qantas will lose its advantage. Not because of some dead drug trafficker.<br><br>Bullocks - As for people not knowing - well those who fly into Singapore will be fully aware of the fact that Singapore has the death penalty for drug traffickers courtesy of the airliner going into Singapore. Want to go into Singapore or any country? Know the laws and protect yourself. Like no girl is going to fly into Saudi Arabia wearing a bikini top and a mini skirt.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by circleofwinter:</div><div class="quote_body">First, calling you a foreigner isnt a personal attack, its a FACT. Once you chose to migrate to another country and decides to permanently reside there, you are a foreigner. Whether you used to be a singaporean or not is a completely moot point. Working there and coming back to Singapore is different from being an Australian PR. Why keep the Singapore passport and call yourself<br>a citizen of singapore when you decide to leave this country for good? when it comes to name calling, you aren't much better yourself  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>maybe if you start being forgetful, you might want to check out old threads and see which part did you call someone else an idiot<br><br>Yes singapore police force is efficient and guess what? we don't have racists burning cars and chanting slogans over here even though singapore does not have the death penalty for racists. An efficient police force isn't going to suck because of capital punishment, and the same applies vice versa. Drug users, ultimately are at fault as well for choosing to take drugs even when most of them knew its wrong and harmful.<br><br>I didn't post a reply to this thread just to win an argument. Rather i am posting my own opinion what i feel about certain things. I don't think i have to repeat myself or reply to irrelevant stuff. I think its a sad thing tho, if someone actually thinks they can win over at the internet.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote><strong> Right , I do not like it when people result to subterfuge and hit another area to win either </strong>. If you had bothered to read what I written - I was directing my argument at Walesa who <strong> seems to like to compare Singapore to DPRK </strong> .<br><br>As for you, I still hold Singaporean citizenship . Got a problem with overseas Singaporeans?<br><br>It is not about winning . You failed to address my points about the hypocrisy of AI . Walesa just wants to argue on a singular point.<br><br>It is very seldom I launch a personal attack unless the other person starts the ball rolling. However with Walesa , he is constant and persistent . Then again both of you are in the same boat - you do not address my points but you choose to hit somewhere else .<br><br>ROFL . You can think what you like about other countries in a country whose laws protect you well and shelter you while you whine about the same law which gives you the safety.  I live in another country so I can laugh at your ignorance of how other countries are really like to make such baseless assumptions.<br><br>You are free to post your opinion and I am free to post mine. Why don't you just address what I commented on then?  Don't bring AI in . I am not playing to win in this argument - I am just waiting to see how many insults Walesa can throw at me besides his usual vocabulary of  "imbecile, idiot etc" . None of you did manage to point out anything except focus on one miserable point .....OHHhh hanging is so evil . <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><strong> Come back to the topic then </strong> . Any great ideas on how to control drugs from coming in and preventing criminal drug syndicates from estabilshing themselves in Singapore if the death penalty is abolished and maintaining the low drug consumption rates?<br><br>Oh ya why not address your point on bilateral relations souring between Singapore and Australia then over one dead drug trafficker? oh wait , I already refuted it for you . So what are you talking about death penalty affecting Singapore's relations with other countries?<br><br>Malaysia once used to jail drug traffickers but after they started hanging them - their illicit drug consumption dropped.</div>
