            <div class='col-md body'>All the philosophical arguments about what is barbaric and what is not. You forget the rights of Victims.<br><br>If you want to talk human rights, think of it this way . You have a right to all those human rights if you respect the rights of other human beings. Once you have committed a trangression in the eyes of law that protects the right of others and yourself even , you forfeit that right.<br><br>Why are we talking about protecting the rights of criminals when their victims have those same rights taken away? Drug traffickers and users made their choice but that choice impede on the rights of families of the drug addicts and other victims who were transgressed upon when the drug user commited a crime against them to feed the habit.<br><br>You basically have a choice and decision to make for the better good of all . You can either choose to be a law abiding citizen or you could chose to be a criminal. If you chose the criminal way, you pay the penalty.<br><br>The fundamental premise behind human rights is the right of choice aka FREEDOM. Those criminals were given a choice. They chose the criminal pathway. They are responsible for their acts . They have to pay the price of that choice which ended up in a criminal act. <strong> Drug traffickers are not victims of circumstances when they hang for their crime - because THEY MADE THEIR CHOICE to VIOLATE the laws WHICH PROTECT LAW ABIDING TAXPAYING INDIVIDUALS' RIGHTS to a safe and healthy society </strong><br><br>Don't tell me how barbaric it is until you know or seen people crying over young one who made the choice and got lost to drugs.  I seen young druggies overdose and go on life support as vegetables for the remainder of the years while their families try to come into terms. Even so teenagers are naturally curious  about the world - anything cool they want. These are the youths which we try our best to protect from the evils of drugs.<br><br>I have personally seen a case whereby a young person thought she would try just 1 pill - she reacted badly and ended up as a living vegetable. Her parents were all too upset . A teenage daughter they so carefully brought up , destroyed  in just a matter of a few minutes because she JUST wanted to try something cool for ONCE.<br><br><strong> SO DON'T BLOODY TALK TO ME ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF THE CRIMINAL, BASED ON YOUR SELF RIGHTEOUS MORALS ,- TELL ME WHERE ARE THE RIGHTS FOR THE VICTIMS? WANT TO TALK? THINK OF THE VICTIMS FIRST BEFORE OPENING YOUR MOUTH. Amnesty International only yabbers like a retard when it comes to human rights to the criminals. So are they saying criminals should have MORE rights THAN LAW ABIDING CRIMINALS? </strong><br><br>The death penalty is a deterrent NOT a purposely planned herding for people to practice hanging on .<strong> It is meant to deter people from carrying drugs into Singapore and destroying lives of human beings especially our youth who might not be wise enough to make their own choices  </strong>. It is a form of protection a country affords its taxpayers against drugs and its social impact.<br><br>Those who got hanged over it - THEY MADE THE CHOICE TO RISK DEATH OUT OF GREED.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by walesa:</div><div class="quote_body">Now, on to the moral perspective - drug trafficking, while widely used for pernicious purposes, basically causes harm only to those who make a conscious choice to consume them (for whatever reasons be they to escape from reality or succumbing to peer pressure). To suggest drug lords and traffickers are guilty of their victim's predicament is thus no more viable a suggestion as suggesting a knife manufacturer should be implicated should someone commit murder using the manufacturer's knife (surely, this scenario cannot be an accident!) - that, in essence, is where I'm coming from which you've obviously failed to comprehend. And no, my stance isn't fact and hence needs no consensus or approval from anyone - it's just an opinion which ranks right up there as sensibly, if not more so, as yours.</div></blockquote>Cut the BS about comparing knives and drugs. Illicit drugs are a crime in itself. A knife is what you need to use in life to cut your meat , your fruits and your bread. <span style="font-style: italic;"> It's like comparing an apple falling out of a tree and accidentally hitting someone   compared to a durian thrown out of a HDB flat to kill someone ( illicit druglords and traffickers) </span><br><br><strong> The illicit drug market is focused on malicious use.</strong><br>Drug lords and traffickers know that growing and trafficking the substance itself are ILLEGAL. They intend to profit from A CRIME. They do not give a damn about telling people about the side effects. They have no ethics. A person they target is usually the young people and usually teenagers or minors as we call them. Teenagers are their best market because teenagers have the mindset of invincibility and would willingly take up anything that LOOKS COOL or FEELS COOL. Once addicted , that addiction will likely follow them through life and increase the sales for the druglords and traffickers. The law seeks to protect all citizens and their children from such dangers and reduce these malicious people from influencing the younger generations.<br><br><strong> These markets are focused on lawful use. </strong><br>Knife manufacturers ( if we are talking brand names like wiltshire) manufacture knives for the purpose of daily and necessary use. They did not intend to profit from murder or crime. Their sole intent is to earn their profits through law abiding citizens who use it legally.<br><br>Even dagger/sword  manufacturers and gun manufacturers sell only through licensed dealers because of the need for registration under the law. That is to do a traceback if a crime has been committed. Even all the pharmaceutical companies and vaccine companies have batch numbers to do a traceback on severe reactions.<br><br><strong> Want to talk moral? So tell me where are the BLOODY rights for victims ? Not the druggies but their families and people whom they hurt in order to get to the drugs? How about young people like teenage minors who didn't know better but tried once and got a major reaction from it rendering them vegetables for the rest of their life?<br><br>Don't talk to me about sparing drug traffickers or druglords' lives. They are criminals - THEY KNOW Singapore HANGS DRUG TRAFFICKERS if they have OVER A CERTAIN AMOUNT - THEY CHOSE TO COME INTO SINGAPORE - THEY GET CAUGHT , THEY HANG . That is HOW it plays out.<br><br></strong><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So those of you so vehemently against drug traffickers hanging....<br><br>Go think about it . Would you rather have them entering your country , influencing your child and creating addicts out of them?<br><br>Have you known of any teenager who overdosed or got a bad reaction that they became vegetables? Have you seen any?<br><br>In Australia , I seen a few and I had mothers crying on my shoulders when their child is pronounced a vegetable or dead. I have seen a heroin drug addict who had to undergo brain surgery - he was screaming in pain and then faint from it because no legit amount of morphine could quell his pain.  I volunteered at a shelter for former homeless drug addicts trying to make good of their life and pick up the pieces. They are no saints and they know it . They feel very sorry for their families, the friends they lost and all the hurt they caused them during those trying years. I spoken to some families who tell me of all the things they done.<br><br>No. I do not feel a shred of sympathy for hung or about to be hang drug traffickers. They are not the victims of Singapore. Society,community and families  are the true victims of drugs.</div>

Some singaporeans are unhappy that their own locals do not get such treatment, so to be fair, imo the best alternative is to change mandatory death penalty for drug trafficking to life imprisonment. I could hardly careless if someone got executed unless it involves me, but i fear of suffering from a backlash if something like this happens again, since i am a singaporean living in singapore.</div>

Unlike murder, it is so easy to sabotage someone with drugs and you can say goodbye to that person's life. What happen if you accidentally fall asleep and someone slip drugs into the bottom compartment of your luggage fill to the brim with all kinds of clothes or whatever?  with the kind of judical system in sg, can you ensure that every drug trafficker is guilty and all of them have a fair trial?<br></div></blockquote>If a person chooses to traffic drugs or engage in recreational drug use willingly.

Why would a trafficker risk huge money in putting drugs in a bag of a person he doesn't know.<br><br>Even if lets say the person was innocent in the first place when he got sabotaged.

Some singaporeans are unhappy that their own locals do not get such treatment, so to be fair, imo the best alternative is to change mandatory death penalty for drug trafficking to life imprisonment. I could hardly careless if someone got executed unless it involves me, but i fear of suffering from a backlash if something like this happens again, since i am a singaporean living in singapore.</div></blockquote>Read my above post on Life Jail Vs Death Sentence.<br><br>Then imagine yourself.
