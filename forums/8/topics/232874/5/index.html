            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by circleofwinter:</div><div class="quote_body">You think of them of them as crazy yappers and hardly see them take into any account of how the criminal affected the victims of criminal activity but let me<br>ask you this question i repeated earlier: how well do you really know AI? have you ever worked with them before? do you come into conclusions that they just a bunch . of lawyers/policy advocates/journalists sitting on the ivory tower making moral judgements and wasting unnecessary resources just simply because you disagree with some of what they said? how about you view them with a fair and unbiased attitude before jumping into conclusions?<br><br></div></blockquote>I did not work for them but I spoken to some members in AI before. Let's put it this way - the impression I have of them -&gt; They are a waste of donations. There are better avenues of justice than AI . There are more worthwhile organisations than AI.<br><br>AI supported troops into Iraq instead of calling for a war to end. Children and people are getting blown up everyday ....that war was for oil not for human rights but they went blindly with the americans leading them on. AI DID NOT EVEN CONDEMN US INVASION OF IRAQ<br><br>They call for an end to Guantanamo bay but did not do anything about Saddam Hussein's trial which was a big circus. <strong> They ONLY MADE ALOT of  NOISE AFTER HE was condemned to THE HANGING. </strong> Where was their regular big headlines stuff? Nada...it was more of a whisper : <span class="small">oh yes we condemn hanging because we uphold human rights yada yada blah. </span> END OF STORY<br><br>Your great AI stood by and watch palestinian blood spilt by the israeli government . Isn't ethnic cleansing against the human rights - why aren't they protesting against the occupation of Palestine and the killing of children and women ? Wait....one small little statement again :<span class="small">oh yes we should be allowed into palestine . </span> END OF STORY. Then when the palestinians retaliated - they get crowned with CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY. When an itamar settler killed a palestinian woman in cold blood and the israelis turn the other way....NO ISSUE OF STATEMENT from AI.<br><br>The empty vessel seems to make alot of noise  when it suits their political cause especially on smaller countries. I call that HYPOCRISY. DOUBLE STANDARDS apply to AI. Yes I am against donating to AI and I will advocate against donations to AI. SPCA deserves more donations than AI - far more. AT least they don't do double standards on cruelty to animals.<br><br><blockquote> <strong><br>http://www.megalink.net/~dale/quitcigs.html<br><br>Cigarette smokers are just as much an addict as someone hooked on crack, cocaine, morphine or heroin....<br><br>http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn4163<br><br>Previous studies have suggested that the earlier someone starts smoking, the more likely they are to be life-long smokers and the more trouble they have in kicking their addiction....<br><br>The results indicate that early nicotine exposure can leave a lasting imprint on the brain....<br><br>so can you tell me are you qualified enough to judge that cigarette addiction cannot be compared to drug addiction? simple because cigarette is cheaper and easily available? </strong></blockquote>Nicotine VS crack, morphine or heroin<br><br>Do you maintain your mental capacity while high on crack/morphine or cocaine? NO .<br><br>Do you maintain your mental capacity while smoking cigarettes? YES.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br><br>if i know a parent of a drug addict, i will tell him that i respect the rights of drug addicts and i agree drug traffickers should be severely punished, but<br>the punishment should not be death. Life imprisonment should be more than sufficient. If they are from third world country/ they got sabotaged into taking drugs, i won't comment further, otherwise i would have told him that drug addicts are also at fault for trying to take drugs<br>simply because its cool. At the very least putting right and wrong aside, drug ttraffickers sell drug because they want to give their family and themselves a better life. Your son/daughter go to school, there is the newspaper, and he has you as your parents, and there is always the internet to warn you the dangers of taking drugs. Despite all the channels of info available to you, you CHOSE to take drugs simply because its COOL hip-hop and stuff? whos *^#&amp;ing fault is that? stop pushing all the blame to the drug traffickers and absolve all blame from your son or yourself, since you are responsible for your own child.<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>Some teenagers are headstrong even though their parents try their best to parent them. I was a teenager once - it was my way or the highway.  Are you going to lock up your teenager if your teenager is rebellious and throw away the key?<br><br><blockquote><br><br>now let me ask you how about you stare at the eyes of the drug addict's parents and tell them straight in their face even if their son is innocent/ got set-up by others without having a fair trial, it is his responsibility and fault and he deserves to be hanged? this is the second most important reason why<br>i think MANDATORY death penalty, not the dealth penalty itself, shld be abolished. Unlike murder, it is so easy to sabotage someone with drugs and you can say goodbye to that person's life. What happen if you accidentally fall asleep and someone slip drugs into the bottom compartment of your luggage fill to the brim with all kinds of clothes or whatever? with the kind of judical system in sg, can you ensure that every drug trafficker is guilty and all of them have a fair trial?<br><br>the most important reason why i think MANDATORY death penalty should be abolished is because i don't want to see singapore suffering a backlash from executing foreigners. </blockquote>You are innocent until proven guilty. You have a right to recourse and appeal. The accused have a right to legal counsel. Did I say lock up single part of your luggage...oh yes I did. If the luggage presents a risk - do not even bring it. My luggage have security tags on each one of them so if it is tempered with - I will know and I have the proof to say it is tempered with.<br><br>At least Singapore does not exercise a Guantanamo Bay type of system under the US Patriot Act.<br><br>Singapore is a sovereign nation . Most foreigners will know Singapore have stringent drug laws. If they are unaware of it , the airline will make sure they are. Why should Singapore bow down to foreign powers?<br><br></div>

A knife is what you need to use in life to cut your meat , your fruits and your bread. <span style="font-style: italic;"> It's like comparing an apple falling out of a tree and accidentally hitting someone   compared to a durian thrown out of a HDB flat to kill someone ( illicit druglords and traffickers) </span><br><br>[b] The illicit drug market is focused on malicious use.</strong><br>Drug lords and traffickers know that growing and trafficking the substance itself are ILLEGAL. They intend to profit from A CRIME. They do not give a damn about telling people about the side effects. They have no ethics. A person they target is usually the young people and usually teenagers or minors as we call them. Teenagers are their best market because teenagers have the mindset of invincibility and would willingly take up anything that LOOKS COOL or FEELS COOL. Once addicted , that addiction will likely follow them through life and increase the sales for the druglords and traffickers. The law seeks to protect all citizens and their children from such dangers and reduce these malicious people from influencing the younger generations.<br><br><strong> These markets are focused on lawful use. </strong><br>Knife manufacturers ( if we are talking brand names like wiltshire) manufacture knives for the purpose of daily and necessary use. They did not intend to profit from murder or crime. Their sole intent is to earn their profits through law abiding citizens who use it legally.<br><br>Even dagger/sword  manufacturers and gun manufacturers sell only through licensed dealers because of the need for registration under the law. That is to do a traceback if a crime has been committed. Even all the pharmaceutical companies and vaccine companies have batch numbers to do a traceback on severe reactions.<br><br><strong> Want to talk moral? So tell me where are the BLOODY rights for victims ? Not the druggies but their families and people whom they hurt in order to get to the drugs? How about young people like teenage minors who didn't know better but tried once and got a major reaction from it rendering them vegetables for the rest of their life?<br><br>Don't talk to me about sparing drug traffickers or druglords' lives. They are criminals - THEY KNOW Singapore HANGS DRUG TRAFFICKERS if they have OVER A CERTAIN AMOUNT - THEY CHOSE TO COME INTO SINGAPORE - THEY GET CAUGHT , THEY HANG . That is HOW it plays out.<br><br></strong><br>[/b]</blockquote>Just shut your trap if you've nothing but mindless drivel to offer. For starters, who defines what's illegal? So if crack were legally available in country A and barred in country B, are we supposed to presume the entire world need share country B's stance on what constitutes legitimacy?<br><br><strong>I never denied that people who violate the rules of the game deserve to be punished as stipulated by its rules.</strong><br><br>That said, you must be a bloody moron to not comprehend the simple logic(without analysing the rules) that implicating others for your own predicament is senseless - and no, you haven't convinced me how a drug lord plays a bigger role in abetting the demise of a victim, compared with that of a knife manufacturer whose weapon is used in a murder.</div>

Like skewers, screwdrivers, hammers, saws as well? Those items are also manufactured for the sole purpose of legal use - to hammer a nail in, to skewer meat , to screw a nail in, to saw wood.  So are you going to use that premise to charge every single manufacturer for manufacturing needed items? The courts will never take that into account.<br><br>Harvesting and manufacturing illicit drugs itself is a crime in most countries. The druglords and drug traffickers know that trafficking illicit drugs are a crime in most countries save for Columbia. That is why illicit drugs costs a bomb to smuggle in.

There were 36 separate offenses throughout the Old Testament (Book of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, &amp; Deuteronomy) that were punishable by death including Murder (no pity), rape, sacrificing to false gods, and so on. We can find instances of execution being carried out in the Bible (e.g., Leviticus 24:10-16). It was practiced both in ancient Israel (as reflected in the Old Testament) and in Judea in the first century (as reflected in the New Testament). Execution was given theological justification, both in the Old &amp; New Testament. The Pentateuchal rationale for capital punishment was not basically in terms of societal order, and thus modern utilitarian values (e.g., does it deter?) have no bearing on the validity of the biblical attitude toward the penalty even though the Bible states it does deter (Deuteronomy 19:20; also see: Eccles. 8:11). The motive for capital punishment was not human desire for vengeance (retribution), and thus modern theological abolitionists on that basis cannot criticize it. There is not a verse in the Bible in either the Old or New Testament that overtly departs from the consensus on the topic. There are no theological stances in either testament (be they forgiveness of enemies, love, non-vengeance, etc.) that may be taken as an implicit challenge to capital punishment. The Bible distinguishes killing in battle, or in self-defense, or in accident, or as execution, from murder and negligent homicide (which alone merit execution).<br><br>Here is quote of jesus himself during the sermon on the mount<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. <strong>Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. </strong>For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven."</span><br><br>So its justified to hang drug dealers &amp; traffickers as they already stain their hands in blood by giving drugs to people who in the end die from it.<br><br>So its still murder technically<br><br><blockquote>What if you were in their shoes, and you wanted to repent but no one gave u a chance?</blockquote>If the drug trafficker was a penitent man, he would repent for his own sins and have no fear of death. If he was about to be hung, he would know his soul was bound for heaven. So in that respect, you should have also prayed.<br><br>I bet you didn't anyway.<br><br><blockquote> if u refuse to grant forgiveness to others, what makes you think you will be forgiven by your father in heaven?<br></blockquote>Many pastors have different points of views. God is the one ultimately the one who judges the souls of people. We cannot judge others so forgiving each other is not a requisite.<br><br><blockquote>One of the most important commandments is to love your neighbour as you would love yourself.</blockquote>Do you follow this commandment to the letter? Do you treat EVERYONE like your best friend? If you do then you can rebuke me.<br><br>Like many Christians in Singapore. They don't follow every commandment.<br><br><blockquote>dont be a disgrace to christains by plucking any blibical name and inserting it into your arguments.<br>If you were to put the commandments(laws) set by humans ahead of the commandments set by god, you might as well give up your faith completely.</blockquote>By assuming i was Christian was a bold move. Can't someone read theology out of knowledge? By that you are insipid as your comments.<br><br>If you read history properly. Most laws are derived from the 10 Commandments. Those were the templates for modern law.<br><br>If you were a good Christian.<br><br>You would know ALL this. But i bet you don't. You know why?<br><br>Coz like many guys here who go to church.

I standby the fact that I argued it the other way. If you have issues with me picking at your intellect , that's a problem you need to resolve with your own pride.<br><br>As for my mindless drivel : what is wrong with [b] asking where the rights of the victims stand? </strong> Some of the quotes seem to be that of protecting the rights of criminals when it seems like they forgot the rights of victims as well.<br><br>Singapore is a small country with a main resource of human beings and its economy dependent on human beings. I see Singapore's drug laws as a defence of their resources. Illicit drugs does not help that resource in any way.<br><br>It is <strong> not a necessity that you would have illicit drugs as part of your daily life </strong>. It is a necessity that we require knives to cut our food . You cannot do without a knife but you can do without an illicit drug. Dp you also know that you can kill with other daily items you use? Like skewers, screwdrivers, hammers, saws as well? Those items are also manufactured for the sole purpose of legal use - to hammer a nail in, to skewer meat , to screw a nail in, to saw wood.  So are you going to use that premise to charge every single manufacturer for manufacturing needed items? The courts will never take that into account.<br><br>Harvesting and manufacturing illicit drugs itself is a crime in most countries. The druglords and drug traffickers know that trafficking illicit drugs are a crime in most countries save for Columbia. That is why illicit drugs costs a bomb to smuggle in.  I don't see how your argument of knife versus illicit drugs at all.<br><br>Answer me this : Have you dealt with a family of a drug addict before? Have you seen first hand how it affects a person or seen how people go homeless because of drugs?<br>[/b]</blockquote>I sure ain't a genius - that said, it isn't all that hard to identify a self-righteous idiot when I see one either.<br><br>Well, yeah, so you know a couple of people who have been afflicted by the repercussions of drug abuse and yeah, it must be the greatest sin to have afflicted mankind. So let's address your bloody issue and talk sense(at least, I find your issues more worthy of addressing than Ignatius' garbage) then. (Quit the crap about being emotional when words like "bullshit" get thrown about just because you think you've seen the world with whatever limited experiences of yours and bragging about it seems so convincing the world shouldn't be entitled to have an alternate view to the gravity of this problem)<br><br>You know, I actually fully understand where you're coming from and if it weren't for your vehement drivel about how narcotics seem the indisputable crime that is indiscriminately more serious than any other crime imaginable, I'd actually make a case for what you're trying to peddle - let me make this as simple as humanly possible lest you get confused and choose to place the emphasis on the wrong parts of my posts : <strong>for starters, I never made a case on whether narco-trafficking should be an offence that warrants capital punishment - this issue, on its own, could jolly well merit another threat on its own, nevermind what crimes warrant the capital punishment(if at all) - but that said, I've got no qualms about the fact that anyone who chooses to violate the rules of any game he chooses to indulge in deserves to face the full force of the consequences(in this case, the death penalty since that's the penalty for violating the laws as enshrined in the Constitution).</strong> So as far as this particular incident is concerned, if you're keen to contest anything written above in bold, I'm more than happy to keep any sane argument going.<br><br>Now, on to the part about the wider, social(ethical,moral, etc) consequences drugs seem to afflict families. Look, I'm not in the least interested in scrutinising Singapore's case here because drugs afflict people anywhere in the world. For starters, arguments like "Singapore's economy is dependent on its human resources" certainly doesn't hold much water in my book - look, your argument isn't <strong>unfounded</strong>, but to use such statements is tantamount to suggesting the strict guidelines are warranted just because Singaporeans are more valuable than their foreign counterparts in strict economic terms. I do not preach eugenics for a living and I'm certainly in no position to comment on such drivel, but needless to say, anyone with a sane mind will not struggle to comprehend the fact every life ruined is one too many(it really doesn't matter if you're needed by your society more than someone else).<br><br>What I am putting to you is this : what makes you so convinced that drugs are the <strong>biggest vices</strong> in the lives of people anywhere in the world? The point I really contested in your original post(which was something you picked on to begin with) was your justification for making narco-trafficking to be a crime that comes across as being the most pernicious to have ever afflicted mankind. I'm not contesting the fact on whether narco-trafficking should be legalised, but rather, why should it - at least, beyond reasonable doubts and accepted as a consensus to a vast majority - be the most serious crime by a mile. Evidently, it's not rocket science to suggest narco-trafficking is not viewed as the most serious crime in many countries - quite honestly, narcotics pale in comparison to other crimes like murder in most countries - and clearly, that tells a story on its own.<br><br>As a matter of fact, I never tried convincing you narcotics shouldn't be taken seriously from a legal perspective - that said, I just don't believe it comes anywhere close to being the most heinous crime imaginable by any stretch of the imagination and that's just my opinion. So what's your fuss about, really?<br><br>Honestly, have you seen how poverty in third-world countries afflict its people (look, I mean third world countries here and not neighbouring countries in SEA which are distinctly poorer than Singapore)? Ever encountered societies/villages plagued by inadequate basic amenities compromising their livelihood? I have seen such cases myself and despite having done that, I don't think I'm even in a qualified position to make a case as to who exactly constitute the most marginalised group of people in society! And here you're trying to expect others to buy your no-alternative, myopic view of what constitutes the gravest threat on mankind? Try telling me those drug addicts(people who made a conscious choice to get involved in that stuff) you encountered deserve a chance at life more than people who suffer through consequences that arose beyond their control!</div>

The point I really contested in your original post(which was something you picked on to begin with) was your justification for making narco-trafficking to be a crime that comes across as being the most pernicious to have ever afflicted mankind. I'm not contesting the fact on whether narco-trafficking should be legalised, but rather, why should it - at least, beyond reasonable doubts and accepted as a consensus to a vast majority - be the most serious crime by a mile. Evidently, it's not rocket science to suggest narco-trafficking is not viewed as the most serious crime in many countries - quite honestly, narcotics pale in comparison to other crimes like murder in most countries - and clearly, that tells a story on its own.[/b][/quote]<br><br>Drugs kill people?

And here you're trying to expect others to buy your no-alternative, myopic view of what constitutes the gravest threat on mankind?

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by walesa:</div><div class="quote_body">Drug lords, traffickers and addicts all make a conscious choice for their actions - you can't pin the blame of the predicament suffered by the addicts solely on the drug lords and traffickers, can you? If your argument made sense, could I then hold an automobile manufacturer responsible if a reckless driver killed a loved one of mine on the road?<br><br>Look, terrorists, mafia, narco traffickers constitute the lesser evil of organised criminals compared with rogue governments who have the backing of the constitution for their ill-intended activities and for which they do not(in most cases) need to answer to anyone...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>Let's tackle your issue then. Rogue governments?  Sorry , that in itself eradicates your argument in totality for it does not apply to Singapore . 66.6% voted for the government - majority wins. It was a democratic decision. Go talk to the 66.6% although most unfortunately ,I wasn't one of them.<br><br>Terrorists are detainable under the <span style="font-style: italic;"> Internal Security Act </span> because they threaten the safety of the public - made out of mainly innocent civilians . Are you saying that  what happened to the WTC Tower1 and 2 by terrorists is a lesser evil ?<br><br>Yes drug lords, traffickers and addicts make their own decisions on their actions. They are responsible for it. I am ok with that.<br><br>As for your logic on automobiles and knife manufacturers , I disagree with it on the following basis :<br><br>1. Addiction negatively affects the lives of everyone in the community, either directly or indirectly.<br><br>2. The economic and health costs of illicit drug addiction to individuals and society are too heavy a burden to bear for Singapore because it is such a small country which depends on the health of its human resources. Bearing in mind, Singapore does not have much natural resources except for a natural harbour which makes it a nice port . Let me name you some of the consequences on the community should drug use be prevalent in Singapore - crime, violence, imprisonment, social unrest.<br><br>Against these basis , no.1 and no.2 will likely eradicate your argument against automobile manufacturers or knife manufacturers. A knife can be used in a crime so can a car. For a crime to happen , the person has the mental capacity to decide on their actions on whether those day-to-day tools would be deliberately turned into weapons.<br><br>Now compare it to illicit drugs. They themselves are a crime and a weapon  in itself. It rips drug addicts of their mental capacity and make them a public nuisance without them being in the high and fully aware of it.<br><br>Singapore is also near the golden triangle of drugs. It can be conveniently used to a hub for drug trafficking if there are no stringent deterrents in place. You do not want to attract criminal attention to Singapore. You want it away from Singapore.<br><br>Singapore - Prevalent consumption of opiates, cocaine, cannabis,amphetamines and Ectasy are one of the lowest together with Brunei , Indonesia and Malaysia based on the Global Illicit drug trend 2003- all of these countries which carry the death penalty for drug trafficking. Hence it can be assumed that there could be some effectiveness in the death penalty for trafficking drugs.<br><br><strong> Let me also point out - when an airplane flashes  the drug trafficker warning about the death penalty in Singapore for drugs - they have a right to flush their load down the loo if they possibly can </strong> . Singapore has a certain cut off in the weight of an illicit drug to pronounce it as a trafficking offence. Those below the cut off weight will be jailed. Those above hanged.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by walesa:</div><div class="quote_body">You've enough on your plate trying to sell your myopic perspective to the unconverted - it's good enough if you addressed issues that concerned you. </div></blockquote>Now please let me know if any points show how myopic I am  .<br><br>I would love to consider your experience dealing first hand with drug addicts and their families  or maybe your <span style="font-style: italic;"> vast experience </span> in drug control policies internationally and nationally.
