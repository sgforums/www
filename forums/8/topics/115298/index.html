            <div class='col-md body'>Ever since I started working in this line(although Im not a property agent) I got to know an agent who like to employ this method to find more prospective home sellers. he would call up an agent and pretend to be a buyer. After he and agent arrange viewing, he would take note of the home owner's address. After the viewing has been made and the agent go home, he would sneak back to the house and convince the home owner to discontinue the services of the previous agent. then he would have the owber's property for himself to sell. Like that he save on cobroking fees. he said its not uncommon. Many agents do that and make good money out of it. he also knows several top gunners from "companies whose offices are located in HDB Hub" that do that. So I have to ask whether this is unethical??? he assures me that no one is breaking the law when they do this. Its just a matter of how you look at it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> Also many agents also put up notices at the bus stop claiming to be a potential buyer, but when they arrive at ur door step they ask you sign exclusive with them <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> Unethical but legal????</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its not illegal but totally unethical but since (MOST) real estate agents are sleaze bags they pretty much deserve it, they are full of deceptions and pressure tactics. They make tons of money from under quoting or over quoting (in some cases) real estate values and mooney embzellment(how u spell it?) from trust accounts. My choice... sell privatley. The legal stuff they say only agents can do is all bull all u need is to have a solicitor arrange contract and have the buyer sign it.
