            <div class='col-md body'><br>I just came back from there for a business trip. Well, the people just speaks that way and boast and lament much like Singaporeans do too. I am quite ok with those of my working colleagues there tough.<br><br>As for shopping, the things are expensive!<br><br>As for food, they have a huge variety of food. Their kampung chickens are very yummy. I especially like the roasted satay chicken I was treated  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  They also got a number of special food. They have wild vegetables that I was told was from the woods (but I can't remember the name of the vege) I also ate their small lobsters from this local restaurant call FOMOS. All you eat is trays of mini lobster after lobster and be prepared to be in a mess. Luckily, plastic aprons and plastics gloves are provided! The taste isn't very fantastic but eating them was fun and an exquisite experience for the first time. You should also try try their "nian gao" which is their local food. Again not very nice but something special. Then there is the hairy crab and it's the season to eat them. Frankly, I have never enjoyed them and I prefer the Singapore's chilli and pepper crab. I can still remember taking half an hour to finish 1 hairy crab and my arms were aching after that! Nonetheless, you should try hairy crab at least once for the experience of it. All in all, for eating, I would recommend that you should try once at their local restaurant (group tour don't bring you) and once at those high class hotel restaurant like in that tallest building in Shanghai.<br><br>As for place to visit, I would think you should also visit the "Wai4 Tang1". You will some very nice colonial buildings and some very special ships and their towering buildings.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There are a number of hotels around. You may want to consider staying at The Bund area, because along the streets are all shopping and it faces the river.<br><br>If not, you can consider Nanjing Xi Lu.. that's like "orchard road" in shanghai..<br><br>Places to visit<br>1. Pearl of Orient (Tong Fang Ming Zhu ta) - There is a museum below which showcases the history of Shanghai. Very interesting. Worth a visit. Of course you can take the lift up to the top of the tower to take a look at Shanghai..<br><br>2. The Bund - Walk along the riverside and take photos..<br><br>3. Xin Tian Di - Its somewhat like Holland V where there are heaps of restaurants/pubs around. There is a Shanghainese restuarant called "Xin Ji Shi". Its very nice. Go there and eat the shanghai fried nian gao.. there are a couple of shanghainese dishes, but I forgot which ones already..<br><br>4. Cheng Huang Miao - There is the very famous nan xiang xiao long bao (we have this branch in singapore) but you can go there and try. The queues are amazingly long. There are 3 levels to this place. Prices go up as you climb up the tower. Lowest level is to buy for takeaway. No place to sit. 2nd and 3rd level there are seating areas.. Either level will do. Do try the Xiao long bao there. Very nice...<br><br>5. Visit the famous water town, zhou zhuang.. its a day's trip.. just outside Shanghai..<br><br>6. Visit Hangzhou, go to Xihu, take the small boat ride. They'll take you to a nei xi hu which is very picturesque and very soothing. Its about 40 mins boat ride if I recall correctly. They'll tell you can go and buy pearls from this place, but you can reject. Think they earn commission.. tourist trap.. There is a restuarant opposite Xi Hu. Ask the locals. Very big restaurant. Go try their Longjing green tea, their prawns (xia ren something), tang chu fish and dongpo rou (these are the must try at hangzhou).<br><br>7. For Su Zhou, there is a tourist place called tiger something (if I recall, I'll post here) There is a leaning tower in that place too.. Su Zhou is a place where you can buy silk products.. blankets.<br><br>If I recall more, I'll post here..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I went to Shanghai for a short holiday in april 2007.<br><br>Firstly, ONLY go to China during Spring or Winter. Because it gets so freaking warm down there easily. And with all the pushing and the crowding and the ABSURD lack of trees, you can get fed up easily and will ruin ur holiday mood.<br><br>Next is, Shanghai is seperated into Pudong and Pu Xi. Both have F.Arked up jams. Serious..really serious jams. Its a place where Tour guides call it : DU CHENG. DU in Chinese meaning JAM and CHENG in chinese meaning City.<br><br>Do go to both Puxi and Pudong. you can see how much urbanisation planning has been put into Pudong. And just near THE BUND, there is a slightly not so urbanised area. its like NEW TERRITORIES in Hong Kong. Very beautiful place. Not something you can see in Singapore, albeit not a tourist attraction.<br><br>Food wise, its inexpensive. But of course, common sense will tell you to eat their local food. What for go to Shanghai and eat hamburgers? Try their TANG BAO(SOUP BAO) or XIAO LONG BAO. TOTALLY ROCKS. Its very cheap too! Like 20RMB for 10pieces = $4 for 10 pieces(XIAO LONG BAO). Their Dim Sums are great. Must try. But of course, mcdonalds and KFC are also found but thats pretty much of a fast food restaurant you will find. its also inexpensive. I got a quarter pounder burger itself for 12.50RMB which is like $2+. And Don't expect them to give chilli sauce. Its just not the norm for them. And there are numerous push carts that you will see that sells a delicacy called ONION PANCAKE. it looks just like a prata but has that onion taste. Costs 0.70RMB each. Cheap. Their fruits are also good! Fresh and cheap. Just buy their local food.<br><br>If you do enter a Chinese restaurant, the food are regular priced. Don't expect a bargain. Expect to see too much oil, too much salt and too much of MSG. But their rice grains are huge and delicious. Just ask for their local delicacy they have to offer. IN shanghai its usually xiao long bao. And order a bottle of beer. Its low in alcohol content.<br><br>Also, try the BBQ Mutton. Which mentioned earlier in another bro's post. Its VERY VERY INexpensive. 2RMB for 4 sticks.<br><br>Shopping wise, nobody, and trust me, nobody will ask you to go to their departmental stores. Its just..STUPID. It looks exactly like OG. And their clothes pricing are WTF!!! its really really really expensive. Their prices make the pricing in Singapore look like its a great bargain.<br><br>Fake goods are not exactly easy to find. Cheap goods are aplenty and inexpensive. A very well made imitation Adidas shoe cost 80RMB there while SIngapore sells it for like $140? But just learn to bargain. I was so good at bargaining i got 80% off. =)<br><br>For transportation, you can try the MRT or whatever you call it there. its again, inexpensive. DO NOT TRY THE BUSES. its crowded and it looks as if it was produced in the 1980s with the layers and layers of dirt accumulating on it. Taxis are like pretty cheap. Good way to travel around. But, most taxi drivers are bad at navigating. Always take a name card from the hotel u stay in which will DEFINITELY have a map of the hotel's location printed on the back of it and show it to taxi drivers when they go "HUH" at the location.<br><br>Well, now, about the people there. There are many, and i really mean, many local people trying to sell their pirated goods. They will usually hold up their catalogue and chase you around and force you to see their catalogue. Just show them the BLACK Face and just walk away. they will stop chasing you. And never ever follow anyone around.<br><br>Also, they are just KAN CHIONG. They are pushy in nature but many are helpful when they see you are in need of directions or basic help. Also, Smoking is allowed practically ANYWHERE. They do spit but not at anybody.<br><br>lastly, is my MUST TRY list.<br><br>1) take the maglev train. 40RMB for a single ticket from Pudong Airport to the next stop.<br>2) Try the food<br>3) Go to THE BUND and pak tor.<br>4) Reach the 2nd ball of the DONG FANG MING ZHU TA.(opposite THE BUND)<br>5) soak up the cool and strong windy air at THE BUND.<br>6) Buy fake goods!<br>7) See the less urbanised areas.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> do what they do, LITTER! I littered alot there, while eating GUA ZI. haha<br>9) Go to NANJING LU. Its beautiful at night.<br>10) Visit Cheng Huang miao<br><br>Thats pretty much for Shanghai. But usually if you go to China, you will stay for 7 days or so. But i think 7 days will get u bored easily. Try Suzhou and Hangzhou. I went there too. Its worth it. many many things to see. Learn the history of Suzhou, about the battle, its silkworms and many more. Expect to see many germans as i've had.<br><br>and lastly, dont call them by XIAO JIE because to them its referred to prostitutes. Try lets say their surname is TAN which is CHEN in chinese. Try ending ALL salutations with a GU NIANG or starting with a XIAO depending on seniority. So its either CHEN GU NIANG or XIAO CHEN.<br><br>enjoy =)</div>
