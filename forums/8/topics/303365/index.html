My class got a bad reputation for being notorious and I dun like the way and it's <span style="color: red;"><strong>3 Express</strong></span> some more. <strong>What A Shame!!!!!</strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Then this teacher from the class opposite our classroom, which turned out to be my physics teacher scolded the class and the relief teacher recieved a compliant from the teacher next door which turned out to be one of the school's disclipline heads. We were asked to move outside GO (General Office) and there we got a 'lecture' on behaviour. Then, it was POA lesson. The class was divided to 2. A Maths and POA. The A Maths teacher was not around and the A MAths pupils stayed put. My Batch (POA) was released, only to meet my POA teacher on the way to class. The teacher heard of the incident and when my teacher's back is turned,<br><br><strong><span style="color: darkred;">THIS IDIOT GO AND FIND FAULT FOR ME CAUSING THE NOISE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! </span></strong><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>I was like silent all along and this girl go copycat and find fault at me.<br>A Chinese boy also find fault at me.<br>Soon, the whole class find fault at me.<br><br>I was like, 'What, you all blame someone innocent???'<br><br>Before the incident, I was disturbed by people poking at me and I can't stand it. It hurts. I have to shout to tell them to stop. They all like think I am a slave like that. I dun want to curse my fellow school mates but I have to in order to make them realise how SERIOUS this situation is.<br><br>Then, after school.<br><br>The same girl who blame me go and complain to herself about me and I decided to make my stand CLEAR!<br><br>Yet, how rude she is. Like WTH! How defiant is my friend here. NO MANNERS. Go shout at me somemore. My class got a whole bunch of rude people. It's such an embarassment for me to just sit there and get blamed so I decided to post this to get help.<br><br>Oh yes, I remembered.<br><br>My class decided to joke with my Sec 3 yearmaster and we got a big scolding saying that 3NA pupils taking Express Maths are better than us, <strong>EVEN 3 Technical Students are slightly better than us!!!!!</strong><br><br>I am completely embarasssed. I would have scored 187 and go to Normal Academic for PSLE 2005 and enjoy the rest of my school years with peace and ease. Now I regret taking Express Course and look at the people in my cohort!!!! I'm not blaming alll of the 3 Express Cohort or my class. It's that my class is the worst Express Class I ever been in my entire life. Correction, anyone's worse class they're ever been in their entire life. Nothing gets worser than that. Think all the words that goes with 'BAD'. Not all my class mates are bad but majority of them have all the words that goes with 'BAD'.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong><span class="large">I AM COMPLETELY STRESSED UP AND WOULD QUIT MY SECONDARY SCHOOL IF THIS GOES ON!
