KNN.......hello eh! TAILOR leh!!!<br>he can't even see the difference between regular long-sleeve vs. slim-fit shirt.....KNN, tailor fake one is it????!!!<br>then the gangster(his sales assistant, i think) stare at me, srunch up shoulders like want to fight. KNN..........eh, this is customer service to the best standards leh, hello! KNN......queensway shopping center u can barely find any decent 20s++ adults; mostly is teens all with same hairstyles(mostly gangster boys there, not much girls) want to act like hong-kong triads.<br><br>the question now is : is queensway shopping center a place for vermins, or is it a hangout for leftovers-scavengers of this society? or maybe it's a haunt for these low-life animals who needs to be tamed?<br><br>now..........<br><br>(axle ken)<br><blockquote>its about how u carry it man, its not about the stuff that make look good </blockquote>yeah lah, but it's optimizing mah. the slim-fit shirts will further enhance one's look to the max, to god-appearance level.<br><br>(FI)<br><blockquote>massimo dutti @ marina square</blockquote>sure anot, FI?

They cater more for the budget-conscious fashionistas and the chic clubbers.  I urge you to give them a try cos I feel that a patterned shirt is more worth the money cos of the design effort put into it.  Plus it is also good to try something new.<br><br>But if you still desire a plain slim fit lower cost shirt, G2000 is your best hope.  Keep your fingers crossed that they still have the stock of right sizes available for you tomorrow.<br>I think G2000 only set up their sales area last nite, so it's <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">unlikely</span></span> that they will cease the sales tomorrow....will <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">probably</span></span> continue till Monday in Bishan.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No lah....G2000 is a Hong Kong-based low-end fashion franchise that managed to expand in Singapore.  Their stuff are standardized from templates and cannot be compared with the mid-range shops like Zara/Topman or the higher end ones like those u find in Paragon.<br><br>Caserini and Domanchi are located at 2nd floor of Centrepoint shopping Centre.<br><br>Domanchi shirts, size 1 and 2 can be rather tight fitting.  Price range fr $49 onwards. Their fitting range is by number 1-4, rather than by roman numerals like S-XL or neck measurements like 14.5 - 17.<br><br>Caserini shirts are mainly European imports.  Prices of 2 for $69 are reasonable, but u won't be able to find a slim fit shirt there cos they are mainly US/Euro-sizes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>G2000 always start off with high prices like $59.90 at the beginning of a new season.  But when they near the end of the season, they will always slash prices by up to 30% - 70%.<br><br>But even though they are low end I do feel that their cutting and standardised designs are rather functionable and wearable.<br><br>I don't think there is actually a "biggest G2000" outlet cos most of their shops are quite similar in sizes.  But if u want a good range can try going to the one at Wisma Atria (Orchard)...I think they have 2 outlets there! One is on the 2nd floor (after u come out of Orchard MRT, take the nearest escalator up to level 2...shares the same floor as Project Blood Bro Shop).  The other one is a few steps away from Zara (near to Timberland).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dude, unfortunately for the current range, it's not yet sales season.<br>But I think u should be able to get a plain slim fit or contemporary fit shirt at a price below $50.<br><br>The only sale that they are holding right now is at Bishan (they are clearing last season's stock), where the striped and coloured shirts outnumber your white shirts.</div>
