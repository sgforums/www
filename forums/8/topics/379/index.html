            <div class='col-md body'>I am extremely surprised over the result. However it's more disappointing as the goal came from a penalty rather than open play, which would have silenced the critics. Now all they'll say is that england was lucky and owen dived.<br><br>Anyhow, the shine shd not be taken off nicky butt who had an outstanding game shackling veron.<br><br>Now argentina has to win their last game. anything less and england and sweden will go thru.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>argentinians hate the english, for invading them in the eighties and annexing the falklands. the hand of god treatment was only part of the just deserts of the english. if you notice, the argentinians play hard, but never so nastily against any team but the english, simply because of the eighties invasion and misery caused to an entire nation. as for england's recent win, what i can say is that its only a group match. i hope argentina will win the world cup, and england won't even make the second round. i lost money over that match as well.</div>
