            <div class='col-md body'>Floating stones found in Rameshwaram temple<br><br>Rameshwaram (Tamil Nadu): Do stones float in water? The answer would be a certain no. But in the island of Rameshwaram in Tamil Nadu, stones, it seems, do float in water. Difficult to believe but it's a reality. Floating stones of Rameshwaram have a mythological twist to it. According to Hindu mythological epic Ramayana, Lord Rama and his army of monkeys used stones to build a bridge across the Palk Strait to link Rameshwaram to Sri Lanka. Legend as well as archaeological findings indicate the first signs of human inhabitation in Sri Lanka date back to the primitive age and it is assumed that the bridge's age is also almost equivalent.<br><br>G Mohan Das, a local historian and caretaker of the stones in the temple, said that these stones could have been the kind used to build the bridge mentioned in the epic. "The history of these floating stones is that when Lord Rama made a bridge to trek to Lanka to bring back his consort Sita, these were the same stones used. But today people do not agree to it. They believe it is a coral. We believe there is no difference in these stones. Both the stones do not have air in them. The composition is the same and it has 40 kinds of chemicals," he said. Space images taken by NASA reveal a series of rock outcrops in the Palk Strait between India and Sri Lanka. Some historians say these could be the part of the mythological bridge linking Indian peninsula with the Sri Lankan island.</div>

The questions is are these characters human or Aliens who came down to earth to educate primitive humans on technology and spirituality?<br><br>Lord Krishna is a god which Indians worship. He'ssaid to have a great infleunce on rulers and emperors of ancient India.

            <div class='col-md body'>Ramayana Bridge<br><br>In October of 2002, NASA took a series of pictures of a "man made" 30 km bridge between Sri Lanka and India. "The bridge's unique curvature and composition by age reveals that it is man-made. Legend as well as archeological studies reveal that the first signs of human inhabitants in Sri Lanka date back to the primitive age, about 1,750,000 years ago and the bridge's age is also almost equivalent." (Hindustan Times) Here is a picture of it:<br><br>Source: NASA<br><br>NASA calls it "Adam's Bridge." What's interesting is that this bridge structure is exactly described in the great epic, the Ramayana (Chapter 66, The Great Causeway). In the Ramayana, Rama builds a bridge to Sri Lanka from India in order to go there and kill the demon Ravana. The bridge is said to have been built with the help of Hanuman's monkey helpers and under the direction of Nala. In the Ramayana, it is vividly described:<br>"Some brought trunks of trees and others set them up; it was by hundreds and thousands that those monkeys, like unto giants, made use of reeds, logs and blossoming trees to construct that bridge, rushing hither and thither with blocks of stone resembling mountains or the peaks of crags, which, flung into the sea, fell with a resounding crash." (Rense.com)<br>It is also described in the Srimad Bhagavatam verse 1.3.22 purport by Srila Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada:<br><br>"Lord Ramacandra prepared a royal road on the Indian Ocean with stones that floated on the water. The modern scientists have done research in the area of weightlessness, but it is not possible to bring in weightlessness anywhere and everywhere. But because weightlessness is the creation of the Lord by which He can make the gigantic planets fly and float in the air, He made the stones even within this earth to be weightless and prepared a stone bridge on the sea without any supporting pillar."</div>
