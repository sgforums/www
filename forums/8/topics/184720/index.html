If this letter is written after he has stepped down, everything would be in past tense.<br><br>For point 4, note this:<br><br>Any sentence that has these words (to, could, will, would, can, can't, wouldn't, couldn't, may, might), the verb will always in present tense.<br><br>For example, I want to <strong>buy</strong> a can of Milo.<br>I would <strong>like</strong> to request for a transfer.<br><br>If the word "be" is added like to be (verb), it would be in past participle.<br><br>For example, XYZ company will be <strong>bought</strong> over by ABC company.<br><br>For point 5, Singapore's judicical system is still here. It's not as if we have merged with another country. If we have merged and our old system is being studied by other countries, it will be "was studied".</div>
