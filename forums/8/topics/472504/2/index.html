              <p>I have no qualms about foreigners who take the top tier jobs
              based on merit, and experience. However, if they want a leg up,
              they must integrate into our local work culture, not the other way
              round.</p>
              <p>For instance, every company I've worked in so far, be it foreign
              based MNC, japanese, or ang mor, would always take the time to do
              the annual hungry ghost prayers, and offering.</p>
              <p>But this ang mor MNC i am currently in hor, VP is Indian, 5
              years here, in their new office, not once has it been done.</p>
              <p>I'm not saying it will bring bad luck, but it reflects on the
              management. To me, its always the smallest things that add up.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>You gotta understand indians and ang mos are different.  Ang mos are generally ready to embrace the local practices any where they go.    Indians are more conservative and reserve and stick to their very own custom, tradition and practices.    </p>
              <p>That is called culture difference.</p>

              <p>now i remeber....its a history that no western country dare publicise.it all started because england wanted to sell opium to china and china didnt want opium to turn citizens to drug addicts.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>china in reality lost..their imperial palace was violated and parts of it were taken away such as hong kong... plus they had to pay vast amount of $$$$$ to the 8 nations every year as compensation for the war for 39 years from 1900.</p>

              <p>It is possible.   About the latest population size target  it has reached beyond acceptance by Singaporeans.   It is what it is targetted because of some self serving purpose.     If you have a spoilt brat to run the country of course things will go downwards.</p>

              "One thing the smart and forward thinking Japanese government initiated in the 90's with some success was a partnership with the American government/corporations. The premise of the agreement essentially allowed a significant % of Japanese professionals to work in similar level positions for a period of time (usually for a 2 yr or 3year period) within American corporations and vice-versa which opened the eyes of both nations and helped with a better understanding and an increased harmony in terms of understanding, especially in terms of the culture within Enterprise."
                  
              That was exactly what the Singapore Government did in the 70s and 80s for MNCs in Singapore and it was ok until the word 'GLOBALIZATION' being spoken like a holy word from every bosses mouth in Singapore lah.

              The MNCs company should send more Singaporeans to their own country first for on the job training or job attachment and then let them fill up the position here whereby they don't have to send their own people here. That would actually help them to cut cost....right.

              <p>Don't be short sighted. What we are today is because of MNCs. Most MNCs have their APAC operations in Singapore which has given us so much employment. If MNCs have their regional operations here, you can expect there to be people from all over the world employed, otherwise they would not choose Singapore in the first place.</p>
              <p>Our governmet has done a good job in attracting international companies of repute because of which we are able to whine and cry on the smallest things today and not appreciate it.</p>

              <p>Look at China today. It is striving so hard to attract international companies to make Shanghai their regional / global HQ. Do you know how much tax rebate China is offering companies that they are tempted to go there? I can name at least 5-6 companies that have shut their regional office in Singapore and moved to Shanghai.</p>
              <p>If this trend continues, our unemployment will go up and our economy will be hit. Regarding population, it is a healthy rise and the government is planning well for it. Not like other countries where population grows first and then gahment thinks what to do.</p>
              <p>If you want to stop foreigners coming in, get more children. Have you not heard of laws of consumption and economic growth? Why is Europe in major recession today? One of the reasons is consumption has gone down as population has shrunk. Same with Japan that was a superpower at one time.</p>
              <p>Maybe invest more time in educating yourself than whining about petty things like foreigners, and let me tell you they do make a sizeable amount of our economy and the benefits we enjoy, because they consume more, pay taxes and help the overall economy. Singapore would not be different from Malaysia if we didn't have them. Grow up!!</p>

              Haha...what you know now has been the trend for decades in Singapore. They are just making the new generation of Singaporean see more foreigners now. People from other country work here and leave here after their company don't need them to be here. That was the trend of yesterday Singapore but only now the Singapore government is doing it on mass basis because they need to increase the population size of Singapore rapidly and for in a short period of time. If Singapore has remain like competitive without increasing the development and population so rapidly.....we Singaporeans could have been in a better position without having to worry so much about skilled or PMEs foreign workers here stealing the bread and butter of SIngaporeans.
              
              In short, Singapore government is trying to show to the world that Singapore GDP is in good and healthy position by increasing the size of population instantly.......right.
