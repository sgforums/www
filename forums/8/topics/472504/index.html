              I agree with your point of view there laa. However, don't you think that most male Singaporeans are hindered from gaining global experience abroad due to their NS and reservist service obligation. It doesn't affect so much for the female Singaporeans but it does affect the majority of male Singaporeans laa. If only NS policy can be review again and amended to see how more male Singaporeans can attain that corporate globalization experience, then probably we can have more male Singaporeans holding higher positions  in the global enterprises......isn't it not?

              <p>Dear Zulkifi Mahmood, </p>
              <p>Your point is a very strong and valid one indeed laa</p>
              <p>One thing the smart and forward thinking Japanese government initiated in the 90's with some success was a partnership with the American government/corporations. The premise of the agreement essentially allowed a significant % of Japanese professionals to work in similar level positions for a period of time (usually for a 2 yr or 3year period) within American corporations and vice-versa which opened the eyes of both nations and helped with a better understanding and <span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.292969);  ">an increased harmony in terms of understanding, especially in terms of the culture within Enterprise.</span></p>
              <p>An interesting idea..</p>
              <p>And if we are talking about securing the CEO positions and Executive Director roles within global companies, it's fair to assume that the trend is not going to change anytime soon.</p>
              <p>My advice: if you are looking to move up within a global company, move overseas for a few years, even if the role is a perceived demotion in terms of responsibility and upon your return to Singapore, your worth will be two-fold laa</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>it  is just like we always have Singaporeans or HK people to be senior managors in international companies Chinese office. I don't think it is related to descrimination or something. I would rather see this fact as a tradeoff between localizaiton and emphasize of corporate culture and mission. One of the reason why Singapore appeals top talents is its friendly environment to foreigners. Anyway, with friendly and open policy to foreign talents, the labor market will be more competitive. </p></div>

              <p>I know of a Singaporean guy who was posted overseas to work as GM.   After contract he came back and had bad time looking for job.   There are admin jobs Singaporeans can do but the govt approve to let foreigners do them.</p>
              <p>Go ask the scumbags who wear white uniform on National Day about it.    If money and self serving are not the top priority Singaporeans employees and job seekers will have better life.    </p>

              <p>I have no qualms about foreigners who take the top tier jobs based on merit, and experience. However, if they want a leg up, they must integrate into our local work culture, not the other way round.</p>
              <p>For instance, every company I've worked in so far, be it foreign based MNC, japanese, or ang mor, would always take the time to do the annual hungry ghost prayers, and offering.</p>
              <p>But this ang mor MNC i am currently in hor, VP is Indian, 5 years here, in their new office, not once has it been done.</p>
              <p>I'm not saying it will bring bad luck, but it reflects on the management. To me, its always the smallest things that add up.</p>
