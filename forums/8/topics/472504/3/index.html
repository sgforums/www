            <div class='col-md body'>To me having more MNCs company here in Singapore is not a problem but Singapore must practice labour protectionism. I see now that having a strong Singapore currency is a problem to Singapore government. Singapore has no natural resources.

What is the used of having a strong currency and yet it benefited the neighbouring countries. Is a simple fact that foreign investors will naturally invest in those neighbouring countries. Most of the MNCs company will just maintain their regional headquarter here but their main business operation will be shifted to the neighbouring countries where the business operation and manpower cost is lower...right. Now we have a problem, we cannot decrease the Singapore currency value because it will only cause greater inflation because those imported goods to Singapore will be even more expensive for us to import. So we are stuck in between now...move forward and keep increasing the dollar value until.....I don't know what will happen if one day we simply cannot increase the dollar value anymore...then it will collapse like during the time when Indonesia government devalue its currency in the 60s.</div>

              <p>Your argument is not based on the right parameters. Companies came to Singapore because of the reliability, infrastructure, policies and stable government. If that were true, companies would not move to Shanghai which if you compare over the last 10 years has become so so expensive, it is unbelievable. The RMB has appreciated more than the SGD in the last few years.</p>
              <p>Currency matters more to countries like China and India that have mass production and IT. Not Singapore which is more of an investment hub and regional HQ.</p>

              Yes, they do look on the basis of how stable the infrastructure of the economy and the government in that country. And they do look at the cost involved for them to run a main business operation in Singapore. There are many reasons why MNCs came here in the past basically because of the system of government policies and its people capability. And also the last thing the government incentives and benefits for foreign investors. About malaysia, they are not worried about Singapore currency is stronger than malaysian ringgit in fact they have benefited from that...see...Iskandar lah. Now many foreign investors are going there to run their main operation there. Singapore will be their regional hq only....cut cost and still have many good years in this region.

              I understand what you mean there and I agree with you. I've work with white people and japanese in the past. MNCs foreign bosses especially the Westerners or Japanese are more understanding. About the local bosses...my opinion they lack the professional touch of managing the company....they should go for management training and upgrading to refine their management skill with people they work with or employed.

              Huh!?? All!!! Lols...
              
              All no lah. Work for a MNC company yes. Talking to most of the Presidents or Vice-Presidents or MDs of the MNCs and doing business with most of the MNCs in Singapore during the 80s yes. Being one of the boss with a MNC company in Singapore yes. Run a local company no but better still I had my own business. My profile and company profile was reported in The Straits Times Life section and later I was interviewed by The Reservists magazine. 
              
              How about you?
