            <div class='col-md body'>Some time ago Rinoa posted a topic regarding something unpleasant happening to her sis and  I was one who gave my opinions. While I knew talking is easier than doing, something happened today that made me UNDERSTAND how it felt.<br><br>I was on a bus when this guy boarded and sat in front of me. It was one of those seats where you face the front of the bus while the seat in front faces the back. I didn't what was happening until this old guy sitting beside me alighted looking quite disgusted. Then I realized the guy sitting infront of me was scratching his groin through a big hole in his jeans. I kept quiet until later on, he unzipped and put his whole hand into his pants, at first, then I think he brought out his penis, but I wasn't sure because his hands were covering it.<br><br>Almost all the seats on the bus were occupied, and yet not one seemed to do anything. At first I hesitated, because I didn't know what was going on, then I decided to do something. But, I made the mistake of asking a lady opposite the aisle if she would support me as a witness when I report to the police. The guy saw me go up to the driver as well as talk to the lady and pissed off the bus.<br><br>The point of my story was that, with all my viewpoints and ideas, when it comes to the crunch, its not easy to actually do something. Maybe its easier to decide to help someone in distress simply because you are not the victim, so to say. There is enough moral obligation and dare I say, sexiness in helping other people in distress.<br>On the other hand, if you are directly involved as I was, you might tend to hesitate and normalize things, so much so that you stuff things up. The "should I or should I bother" is such a nagging thought that its scary. Now all I'm feeling is that I quite disappointed that I didn't manage to catch the bugger that time, so he's free to do whatever he did to someone else.<br><br>I'm one of those people who comes up with a retort long after someone has mouthed the insult; one of those losers who think of the answer to an exam question 2 hours after the exam ended. I'm sick of saying "next time I'll do so and so" because the next time something happens it will be in a different circumstance so I'll probably be caught off guard again.<br><br>The same applies to anything that life throws at you. Like relationships, like getting dumped, like getting robbed, like getting backstabbed. I find it easy to be objective and look at the logical way to address the problem, but when in the midst of it, the confusion and shock makes it @#%^$ difficult.<br><br>Anyway, to look on the bright side, I've learnt some lessons.<br><br>1) Tell the bus driver that there is a robber on board and drive to the nearest police station. Otherwise you'll waste time explaining to some cowardly idiot without a sense of compassion who just wants to get to the interchange fast enough to has his teabreak, and don't want any trouble.<br><br>2) Tell him also not to open the door. Otherwise that bugger can get off.<br><br>3) Carry something that you can tie the bigger up with. I wanted to tie his neck to the bar behind him but decided to do otherwise.<br><br>[This message has been edited by pacman (edited 26-11-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I also read the post on Singaporeans. Its not only Singaporeans are like that. The thing I mentioned actually happened in Australia, where I'm studying. People are the same everywhere lah.<br><br>I did bring some tying equipment. This strap on my bag was long enough. But I'll take your advice to test it before letting you know.</div>
