Young children envy adults for being able to do what they want. Adults envy elderlys for being able to take life at a slow pace. And elderlys envy kids for they seem to be full of energy 24-7.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When you need to go to work, so getting up in the morning it is a drag. You want to enjoy five minutes more. But on off days, its not like that, because you don't have to get up.<br><br>You have work, thats why you envy her. But when you are jobless, believe me you won't enjoy that kind of lifestyle.<br>It is genuine misery.<br><br>Does your ah mah have a choice?<br>If she has, it is better she get up and about.<br>Muscles, use it or lose it.<br><br>I have seen many ah mahs, very loved earlier, but later put in an old folks home. The siblings explaining defensively, that they have..... no choice.<br>Its very, very painfully sad.</div>
