            <div class='col-md body'>Unfortunately employers in Singapore are still very limited in their human resource vision. They think that people who study the humanities are not worthy of employment at the highest levels. In fact, humanities students are in high demand by employers such as Goldmann Sachs and Merrill Lynch in other countries such as the UK and US. A good education in humanities prepares you for the working life better than what you think the sciences can. If you are aiming for the high places, you'd do well to pursue further education in those countries.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>heyyy.<br><br>THERE IS IMMENSE VALUE IN PURSUING HUMANITIES!! Its a bonus if you really have a passion for it too! =)<br><br>I am currently taking lit hist econs and maths all at h2 level...plus h3 hist and i think its pretty myopic to think that studying ARTs wldnt get you as far as a one with a SCIENCE education. It is not a soft option for one to take the road less travlelled (quote robert frost! haha) because you really have to be certain what you wanna do in the future before you opt for a humans course. In my case I have already made up my mind to study law in spore...after which I hope to go on and read sociology and ethnic studies in some liberal arts college in the US. Havent decided where, hopefully dartsmouth, williams or middlebury hahaha.<br><br>But anyway, studying the humanities unlocks a whole plethora of opportunities. Job prospects are aplenty. If you are game enough you can venture into politics, law, business, finance, advertising, social science research, human resource (hello more than just teaching). Well its true to an extent you wld have just shut urself out from jobs in engineering or biomed industry but ask yourself, how many ppl you know actually prowl these areas after their a levels? Many of my seniors who took science go on to study courses which you would have an edge in if you study humans. At the end of it all, universities and companies juxtapose a set of students with similar academic results but the humanities student will be equipped with flexibility in thought to deal with complex ideas, and have an emotional make up capable of coping with elements of uncertainty. It may be frustrating to realise that in ur subjects, answers are not necessarily right or wrong but that they require careful and cogent debate. An ARTs student will need high level of dedication and motivation to cope with such rigour, but ultimately you will emerge more mature and hardened in thought. And ultimately it is these qualities which make good businessmen and administrators, for they essentially deal with the complexity and irrationalities of the real world!<br><br>YUP! so i hope i you will press on in with ur subject combi.  Humans students have exciting and promising prospects, more so abroad to be honest actually, but at the end of it all it is also doing what you are passionate abt which matters most!</div>
