            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry for this VERSION 2 thing. Because of the firewall at my posting PC, I cannot reply DIRECT through that POST. BUT, there are SOME THINGS I really wish Copperwings can hear me out....<br><br>[QUOTE]<strong>Originally posted by Ashley:<br><br>Well, i don't know where you got this impression but u are very wrong. Somehow i really wonder how old are you, how can you thinking be so childish.<br><br>My concept may not apply to all girls.<br>But at least what I said is true for many.<br>Go Orchard Rd and you will understand, those chao ah bengs all got pretty girls playing pool with them, whereas the nice guys can only 'play with themselves'.</strong><br>Who told you that 'pretty girls' are 'nice girls' AND who told you that those 'nice guys' are 'handsome guys'....? If it doesn't matter if the 'nice guys' are handsome or not, PLS re-organise your thoughts....<br><br><strong><br>No one will cry for you if you never put in real feelings and love. try moving from one tree to another just for the sake of conquering one tree, you will find yourself with nothing at the end of the day. Somehow i believe you can't choose who you will fall in love with,from you point of view, aren't you getting a gf for the sake of getting one? If its true, i despise you.<br><br>I used to put in real love and feelings in my past relationships, in the end what do i get?? Only get heartbreaks and disappointments. I did not do anything that is wrong, what have I done to get such a heartbreak?????? </strong><br>Lighten up....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Who ever told you that you're the ONLY ones who are getting the heartbreaks...? Guys and girls are all EQUAL creatures... They both feel HURT and PAIN... To what extent you can NEVER compare because you can never be in another's shoes....<br>ALMOST everyone have been hurt at least ONCE in their lives. It's NOT surprising and no SPECIAL UNFAIR treatment projected IN YOUR DIRECTION. You can choose to HATE and you can choose to CRY. But I bet you'll be SURPRISED if it can help pretty much.<br>If it really help in your case let me know? I can already NAME you the 'little effect' that these actions can do to help you in the most limited ways already... I believe you're a SMART guy, it's just that you DON'T ONLY think in life.... &lt;- Gotta learn to THINK in the CORRECT DIRECTION.... Otherwise you'll still be going nowhere.... <strong><br><br>Each time I fell in love with a girl, I always get made used of, asked to do projects for them, help them buy things, solve school problems for them. And they never get serious with me. They just want to make use of me. Made me wait at the MRT for 1 hour without showing up...<br><br>That is how I learned about not being serious in relationship. The more serious you are, the more you get hurt.<br><br>despise me or not, it has nothing to do with me. I will still do the way I want.<br><br>Sausage,<br>tell your friend dont be a nice guy anymore. It is not worth it AT ALL. Those stupid girls do not deserve to have your friend<br><br>[This message has been edited by CopperWings (edited 26 May 2001).]<br></strong><br>Sorry, no time for this part... Gotta WORK.... My ADVICE for now... STOP DREAMING and START LIVING......<br><br>------------------<br>I have no 'friends' nor 'family'.<br>I hold no past and see not future...<br>These are just samples of illusions....<br>I don't exist, but I shall live ETERNITY.....

ACTUALLY.... Do you believe in the TV...? How about ADVERTISEMENTS on the TV...? YES? NO...? KPO me reminds you that newspaper is also a FORM of MEDIA... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> And a very effective one too... If you keep your eyes WIDE OPEN perhaps you'll just understand what I'm saying here one day...? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Besides.... These stories are EVEN MORE LOUSY than trusting your OWN 'SAMPLING'.... Those are just materials that people have chosen to present to you... Just like 'stamps' they stick over your eyes.... Just like the fruit seller or choose to arrange his nice oranges on top to cover up the rest.... Just like... Hehheh.... Your 'pretty girls'....? :p:p &lt;- No offence girls! Not referring to all of ya!! ~OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT..~ NO MORE FLIRTING FOR ME FROM TOMORROW ONWARDS... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">`~~<br>Sigh~~...Girls really dont know what's good for them. And you look at how poor sausage's friend has suffered.<br>My sentences are so true : Being a good guy does not pay.<br><br>YUP... You HIT the 'Jackpot'..... IF you look at how poor sausage's friend has suffered.... YOUR SENTENCE would be so TRUE.... PROVIDED that his story is TRUE... And TRUE for his CASE (That incident ONLY...)<br><br>PERSONAL ADVICE: I know you've somehow being 'stabbed' before... But tearing up your wound to show people how badly you're bleeding WON'T HELP at all.....<br><br>------------------<br>I have no 'friends' nor 'family'.<br>I hold no past and see not future...<br>These are just samples of illusions....<br>I don't exist, but I shall live ETERNITY.....
