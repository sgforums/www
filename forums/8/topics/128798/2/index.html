            <div class='col-md body'>Let me help u along.<br><br>1st Point, ask yourself about how good you are....you should know your own capabilities.<br><br>2nd Point, people always say its best to find a job that you enjoy doing. That means perhaps the job is in line with your interest etc. Its rubbish. 5 yrs down the road, 10 yrs down the road, when u realised you have been doing on the same thing over the yrs, interesting can also become boring. So Job being Job, I feel its more important to find a Job whereby u can find your own self-worth and make yourself feel useful.<br><br>3rd Point,with the above 2nd point in mind, So what if a job is boring?!?! If the $$ is good, if the bosses are nice, if the working condition is good, if your colleagues are nice bunch of ppl, wouldn't tt be good enough?<br><br>Last but not least, Consider all factors before you determine if your current job have more cons than pros. If otherwise, perhaps u already have a job tt might suits u as a person very well...just tt u are not aware of it and is still searching or hoping for something better....however, unless u are very strong in 1st point (capabilities)....else, try to learn the art of self-contentment.</div>
