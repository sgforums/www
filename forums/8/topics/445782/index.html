              <p>Do you all really think that america is the most powerful country in this world?</p>
              <p>I don't think so.</p>
              <p>During World War 2, it takes america and the whole world to join force before they could defeat just 3 countries Japan, germany and italy. And if they were not lucky to have invented the atomic bomb, who knows whether they will even be able to win the war anot.</p>
              <p>During vietnam war, china was very weak and poor country and america at that time was the most powerful country in the world.</p>
              <p>But still china win the war.</p>
              <p>If China and America today is to fight a war, I am sure China will win the war. Even if america and all the european countries join force, china will still be able to defeat them.</p>
              <p>I think america is just a paper tiger</p>

              <p><br>Of course it matter cos China didn't have the brain and technology like the america to even make usefully weapons : <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/american-battlefield-weapons-2011-4">http://www.businessinsider.com/american-battlefield-weapons-2011-4</a> , can you tell me if the first modern aircraft carrier is built by China or USA ?,If the soviet are stingy and didn't provide arm to China, no way they can get an decent gun or plane. Even Asian countries like Japan and Taiwan learn to catch in term of arm technology while it is an well known secret that china is still using 50s weapons.</p>
              <p>And you think soldier from China who cannot even know how to throw an grenade can be an asset to win a war ? you just didn't know incident that this that was not reported in news. <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/army-recruit%E2%80%99s-hand-grenade-throw-goes-awfully-wrong.html">http://sg.news.yahoo.com/army-recruit%E2%80%99s-hand-grenade-throw-goes-awfully-wrong.html</a> . And I agreed that China is doing very well despite the poison milk power that recently they orgainized another "fooling around" strike to LG Nanjing branch factory in China as they are "over-welling pay" than people from US or the rest of the world :</p>

              <p>Most powerful ? In terms of military strength, yes. The population of China is many times greater than the US, but their military is not strong (yet). </p>
              <p>Most powerful ? In terms of economy, yes. The US economy is still the biggest in the world, but will be overtaken by China soon, and India after 2050. </p>
              <p>Most powerful ? As in culture, yes. American culture is the most influential in the world, thanks to the drama, movie and music industry. But cultures of other countries like South Korea, China and India are beginning to gain popularity worldwide as well.</p>
              <p>Most powerful ? As in the mentality of the society, no. Japan and South Korea easily triumphs every other country in the world when it comes to mentality. Most Americans are not willing to work and study 18 hours a day to keep their country's economy in the top position. </p>

              China attack US on US land. US win
              US attack China on China land. China win
              Simple reason. geographic advantage. 
              
              Battle on sea, US win. China no aircraft carrier
              Battle on land, China win. 1.3+ billion people is not for show de
              Battle in air, US win. F22 is still too much for the china air force to handle in an air-to-air combat.
              
              The important thing is that, China government now is fking rich.

              <p>actually, ts asking this question is like asking which car is the fastest. Different cars can be the fastest depending on the variables that they are tested against. For example in under 1.6 cat could be xxx car, but say from 2-3litre cat could be this yyy car. And somemore, fast also have different type of fast. Fast in acceleration to 100mph, fast in a straight road, fast in wet condition, fast in 50 lap F1 race... etc. The variables are endless.</p>
              <p>hence it is difficult if not impossible to determine which is the most powerful country. It's not just about the military hardware, but also the quality of the hardware, the ability of the people to use it, the sustainability to using it, the mental backlash on the soldiers as well as the civilians at home (Let's not forget his troops fought life and limb overseas, Thomas Jefferson fought an equally difficult if not harder war of convincing his country men to continue to support the war). There are also other avenues of "power" to consider for example controlling the economy, hacking the intelligence network and selling sensitive info to potential rivals, etc.</p>
              <p>But having said all this, i believe in hand to hand, solider to solider, the most dangerous solider would be one from NK. There is a limit how much an american soldier fights and risks his life as he has family, assets and country behind him. A NK fighter will go all out because they have nothing in the first place. If they fail, they have nothing. If they win, they have everything.</p>

              <p>Whether US or China will be enemy will depend on issue like Taiwan. If fact if I remember correctly, some year back one of taiwan lawmaker (Not sure if his name is Lee Ao ?) had make a daring statement in the cabinet of creating time line for "indepenence" stated that now the government had US support, if they really want to be "free", they need to make decision before the next election and US will provide "free" arm to Taiwan under some international act.Luckily no much attention was given and KMT is stlll the majority opposition as well.</p>
              <p>Not to forget to mention Tibet human right issue as well, which Obama support "human rights for Tibetans " and the south china sea dispute over oil rich island.Interest of conflict is always the spark of the war.</p>

              <p>america is going to implode like Russia very soon. american has a lot of problems, esp its debts, owing some 14 trillion dollars? they will not go bankrupt anytime soon, but this is unsustainable going forward.future generations will need to pay interest for the debts they owed.</p>
              <p>america cant afford to have overseas troops and base, that did nothing, but peace keeping. can america afford its welfare system of the 60s? can america keep on spending its present way in future? some of the US states are bankrupted! the future doesnt look bright for US. China may overtake US very soon, based on current projections of growth.</p>
