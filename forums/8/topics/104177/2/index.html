            <div class='col-md body'>Guess not really a trend but in r/s these days, the stigma of having a gf's who's older or bf who's younger isn't like before. Hence, everyone can pursue a r/s more "freely" i guess, which constitutes to the relative increase (at least in the context today, ppl are more willing to disclose that that have an older gf or younger bf) in guys having older gfs?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm Hi there, I don think its a trend.. Hmm... I used to be always thinking and SAYING it out LOUD that, I can't go for someone that is younger than me or the same aged... Becoz, I feel that there will be problems communicating and that maturity level is not on par either. And all my ex-bf are at least 10 years older than me.<br><br>But, who knows years later.... I am now attached with my bf whom is one year younger than me. :O Everyone around me... was shocked till dumbstruck. Hmm.... we started out as friends, our common thinking is.... "you are not for me". As times goes by, I think we just have likings for each other... and clique well. That's becoz, its possible that pple younger than you are more knowledgable???? pple younger than you can be more matured.. than their age group? pple younger than you can be someone that is more disciplined than you, smarter than you..... holding a position higher than you in the company????? pple younger than you have more exposure than you???? pple younger than you can be wiser???? anyone, didn't see pple younger than yourself... succeeding?? I've seen many....<br><br>Having a bf or gf.. be it older or younger...its not only about I love you! you love me! we are one big family! its about showering care and concern..... maintaining the relationship... taking care of each other.... and many other factors. Hence, its not whether its the guy's job or the girl job to take care of their partners.....<br><br>I take care of my bf..... when he is not feeling well or is ill. Its so much like a mother figure taking care of the child... becoz, I think....you wont be just hugging and kissing him when he is sick. You wont be thinking oh.. he's sick, he can't play with me. darn.. let him sleep at home, I go find my friends and play! But you really love him...wants the best for him hence You do more... you make sure that if he needs anything.... that he can't reach... you get it for him. You make sure that there's food for him to eat....water for him to drink. Whether he's feeling hot or cold. You accompany him to the doctor..... if he have any vommitting and things like that, you clear off the mess.. and make sure he recuperate in a clean and airy environment..You wont say EEEEEEEEE very smelly, so big already still anyhow vommit?<br><br>NO matter how old/young the guy is.... he needs a woman behind him.. too. He needs to be nurtured, taken care of..to be pampered and of course to be hoaxed.....Everyone has a childlike character in him or her... so, doesn't mean that he is younger means he is naive, he is childish....<br><br>Mature guys has got charisma.... the older the guy is.... the more attracted girls would be. But, I think young guys have got charms too... its just that the charm is not rippened... to charisma! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I love my bf very much.. and I believed he does too.... We often compete who knows more... afterall we will still teach each other things..... share facts that we know of.... He gives me confidence in him that he would be working hard and that we would either be on par... or competing to be the best in studies or career.. and yes.. all along we are on par in terms of studies ...hmmm... am contented for the present (not sure abt the future).... But, I guess..... isn't this more exciting then... having those matured guys hmm..having to focus on careers... and hmm... just didn't bother about how you feel.. and gives you a bouquet of flowers when you just pop into the office, for a last minute can't make it for the date excuse?????<br><br>Simple yet growing with each other..... That's NIce and Sweet... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Erm.... maybe, am having honeymoon stage.... that's y... I am feeling so sweet... I could foresee there are going to be many problems that we faced.... The thing is.. every relationship has got problems. Its the lover's mentality, the lover's love for each other, determination to want to make this r/s work. So, age and looks and height wouldn't bother... if both are really in to make it work....  and I know, I am willing to go thru it... not sure if he does?? haha<br><br>In a nutshell: if you have older bf... and younger bf...... do what you think, its best suited... in the r/s. spice it up.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> and enjoy the process of r/s........<br>Don claimed that, its wrong.. becoz NO ONE HAS DID IT RIGHT! doesnt mean that having a younger bf.. is a sure break off ending.. and having a older bf... means live happily ever after! Think about what I say with an open mind.... and you will be enlightened! hahahah ops! :X<br></div>

But, I guess..... isn't this more exciting then... having those matured guys hmm..having to focus on careers... and hmm... just didn't bother about how you feel.. and gives you a bouquet of flowers when you just pop into the office, for a last minute can't make it for the date excuse?????<br><br>Simple yet growing with each other..... That's NIce and Sweet... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Erm.... maybe, am having honeymoon stage.... that's y... I am feeling so sweet... I could foresee there are going to be many problems that we faced.... The thing is.. every relationship has got problems. Its the lover's mentality, the lover's love for each other, determination to want to make this r/s work. So, age and looks and height wouldn't bother... if both are really in to make it work....  and I know, I am willing to go thru it... not sure if he does?? haha<br><br>In a nutshell: if you have older bf... and younger bf...... do what you think, its best suited... in the r/s. spice it up.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> and enjoy the process of r/s........<br>Don claimed that, its wrong.. becoz NO ONE HAS DID IT RIGHT! doesnt mean that having a younger bf.. is a sure break off ending.. and having a older bf... means live happily ever after! Think about what I say with an open mind.... and you will be enlightened! hahahah ops! :X<br></div></blockquote>Thanks for giving me a bit of hope  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Ok...Maybe not a bit.

After reading what she said, I feel kinda...what would you say ? err.r.r.r. That maybe relationships are not such a bad thing.<br><br>Anyway, Ok I will confess... I kinda like a younger guy. The thing is, for reasons I shall not disclose here, we are not compatible. Besides, that thick headed ass doesn't know ! So i am kinda upset over it. And you know what's worse ? He likes this bitch of a girl and I have to act like his older sis to match them...which I sincerely tried even though its..killin me   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>ArrGGGghhh.<br><br>I hate guys.
