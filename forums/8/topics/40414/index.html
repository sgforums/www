            <div class='col-md body'>Bush, General Musharraf, Mahathir and Gloria Arroyo were sitting together in a train. The train suddenly goes thru a tunnel and it gets completely dark. Suddenly there is a kissing sound followed by a slap. The train comes out of the tunnel.<br>Arroyo and Musharraf are sitting there looking perlexed. Mahathir was bent over holding his face, which is red from the apparent slap. All of them remained diplomatic and nobody says anything.<br>Musharraf is thinking: " These Malaysians are all crazy after Arroyo, Mahathir must have tried to kiss her in the tunnel. Very proper that she slapped him."<br>Arroyo is thinking: " Mahathir must have moved to kiss me but kissed Musharraf instead and got slapped."<br>Mahathir is thinking: " Damn it, Musharraf must have tried to kiss Arroyo, she thought it was me and slapped me instead."<br>Bush says to himself " If the train goes thru another tunnel, I would make another kissing sound and slap Mahathir again."<br><br>==========================================<br><br>The Pope had just finished a tour of the Florida's East Coast and decided to take a limousine to the airport. Having never driven a limo, he asked the chauffeur if he could drive for a while. Well, the<br>chauffeur didn't have much of a choice, so he got in the back of the limo and the Pope took the wheel. He turned unto I-95 and accelerated to about 90 MPH.<br><br>WHAM! WHEEEEEEEEEEE! The blue lights of the State Highway patrol flashed in his rear-view mirror. He pulled over and a trooper came to his window. The trooper saw who it was, he said, "Just a moment,<br>please,<br><br>I need to call in." The trooper radioed in and asked for the chief. He said, "I have a REALLY important person pulled over and I need to know what to do."<br><br>The chief replied, "Who is it ? Not Ted Kennedy again?" The trooper said, "No, even more important."<br><br>"It isn't the Governor Jeb Bush is it?" asked the chief. "No, even more important," replied the trooper.<br><br>"It isn't the President George Bush, is it?" No," replied the trooper, "even more important."<br><br>"Hello, WHO the HELL is it?!" screamed the chief. The trooper responded, "I don't know for sure but I think it might be Jesus, because his chauffeur is the Pope.....!!<br><br>=======================================<br><br>Little Johnny and his dad went shopping at the grocery store.

Johnny said "No!"<br><br>"Well, theres your answer" replied the dad.<br><br>Later, Johnny asked if he could have some candy. His dad again said "Can you touch your asshole with your dick?" Johnny said "No!"<br><br>"Thats your answer" his dad replied.<br><br>At the end of the shopping trip, Johnnys dad felt bad about how he had talked to Johnny, so he brought him an instant lottery ticket.<br><br>Johnny scratched the ticket and found that he won $1000.00. His dad said "Hey, Johnny boy, you gonna share the money with your old man?<br><br>Johnny asked, "Can you touch your asshole with your dick?<br><br>Johnnys dad replied "As a matter of fact, yes, I can"<br><br>Johnny said "GOOD, GO FUCK YOURSELF!"<br><br>===================================<br><br>A waitress walks up to the table of three Japanese men at a New York City restaurant.

She responds, "But why are you whacking off?"<br><br>One of the three says, "Because menu say `first come, first served!"<br><br>===================================<br><br>Doctor Dave slept with one of his patients and felt guilty all day long. No matter how much he tried to forget about it, he couldn't. The guilt and sense of betrayal was overwhelming. But every once in a while he'd hear an internal, reassuring voice that said:<br><br>"Dave, don't worry about it. You aren't the first doctor to sleep with one of their patients and you won't be the last. And you're single. Let it go..." But invariably the other voice would bring him back to reality: "Dave, you're a vet..."<br><br>======================================<br><br>A Brit, a Scot, and an Irish were having a drink. they started arguing about who's wife was the thickest (dumb, stupid).<br><br>The Englishman goes: "My wife is so thick, the other day she spent 25 quid on baby's napkins, and we don't even 'ave a friggin baby!"<br><br>It's the Scotsman's turn, and he goes: "That's nothin. my wife's so thick, she spent 6000 pounds on a car, and she doesn't have a fookin licence!"<br><br>The Irishman knows he's on top of this one, and goes: "You lads don't know what thick is.

            <div class='col-md body'>One day a young man and woman were in their bedroom making<br>love. All of a sudden a bumblebee entered the bedroom<br>window. As the young lady parted her legs the bee entered her<br>vagina. The woman started screaming "Oh my god, help me,<br>there's a bee in my vagina!" The husband<br>immediately took her to the local doctor and explained the<br>situation.<br><br>The doctor thought for a moment and said "Hmm, tricky<br>situation. But I have a solution to the problem if young sir<br>would permit." The husband being very<br>concerned agreed that the doctor could use whatever method to<br>get the bee out of his wife's vagina. The doctor said "OK,<br>what I'm gonna do is rub some honey over the top of my penis<br>and insert it into your wife's vagina. When I feel the bee<br>getting closer to the tip of my penis I shall withdraw it and<br>the bee should hopefully follow my penis out of your wife's<br>vagina. The husband nodded and gave his<br>approval. The young lady said "Yes, Yes, whatever, just get<br>on with it."<br><br>So the doctor, after covering the tip of his penis with<br>honey, inserted it into the young lady's vagina. After a few<br>gentle strokes, the doctor said, "I don't think the bee has<br>noticed the honey yet. Perhaps I should go a bit deeper." So<br>the doctor went deeper and deeper. After a while the doctor<br>began shafting the young lady very hard indeed.<br><br>The young lady began to quiver with excitement. She began<br>to moan and groan aloud.<br><br>The doctor, concentrating very hard, looked like he was<br>enjoying himself, he then put his hands on the young lady's<br>breasts and started making loud noises.<br><br>The husband at this point suddenly became very annoyed and<br>shouted, "Now wait a minute! What the Hell do you think<br>you're doing?" The doctor, still<br>concentrating, replied, "Change of plan. I'm gonna drown the<br>motherfucker !!"<br><br>======================================<br><br>Vajpayee (Indian's prime minister) once went to England to have a diplomatic session with Tony Blair. When he arrived he was greeted with 100 servants and was brought to Tony Blair's Mansion, which was the size of a football field, and the garage was filled with Lamborghinis and Ferraris and supercars. Vajpayee was shocked. He asked Tony Blair, 'How did you manage to afford all this wealth with your merely salary of only 200000 pounds a year?"<br><br>Tony Blair replied by taking Vajpayee to a big window in his house and asked him to look out of it. And he said, 'do you see that big bridge over there across the river? And Vajpayee said' Oh yes, but what has that got to do with your wealth?" And Tony Blair said "Well I got 30% from the money allocated for it by putting in low grade materials, So you see you have to be a bit corrupted to make it in life at least a bit."<br><br>With that Vajpayee left for India and 2 months later Tony Blair visited him for diplomatic talks. There he was welcomed by over 1000 servants to a palace the size of 3 football fields with the garage full of private jets helicopters and the palace full of gold furniture. Tony Blair nearly dropped dead after seeing this. He asked Vajpayee with shock.Â” What did you do to get all this wealth with your merely salary of a few hundred thousand rupees a year?" Vajpayee brought Tony Blair to a big window and said "Do you see that big bridge over there across the river?" Tony Blair said, "Ummm nope I canÂ’t see anything for miles"<br><br>And Vajpayee said "Well that was 100%!!!"<br><br>==========================================<br><br>A koala bear was approached by a prostitute. Since he had never been with one before, he was curious and excited. They spent the night together in a hotel, and he went down on her the next morning one last time before departing.<br><br>As he was heading for the door, the prostitute yelled, "Hey, what about my money?" The koala turned, gave her a puzzled look and shrugged his shoulders.<br><br>She said, "Come here", and pulled a dictionary out of her purse. She pointed to the word "prostitute" and its definition, "Has sex and gets paid."<br><br>Finally understanding, the koala borrowed her dictionary, turned to the word "koala" and showed her, "Eats bush and leaves."<br><br>================================<br><br>Three men who were good friends passed away simultaneously in an airplane crash, and all 3 appeared at the gates of heaven. At the entrance was God and He told them: "Welcome to heaven; but before I can judge how each of you can be treated in heaven, I need to assess your life on earth."<br><br>He turned to the 1st man: "Have you ever cheated on your wife?"<br>"No; never," insisted the 1st man. God said: "That's perfect," and He gave the 1st man a Rolls-Royce to drive around in heaven.<br><br>Then he asked the 2nd man: "What about you? Ever cheated on your wife?" The 2nd man hesitantly replied: "Errrrrr......only once, Your Almighty." God said: "That's good, at least you're honest," and God gave the 2nd man a BMW.<br><br>Then God asked the 3rd man: "Well, what about you?" The 3rd man thought for a moment:"Wah......if the 2nd man can have an affair and drive a BMW, then I guess I won't be that worse off." He replied God:" Only a couple of times, O Lord." God said to him: "That's not bad," and He the 3rd man a bicycle.<br><br>The 3rd man became unsatisfied, and started complaining to the 2nd man:"WTF?!!! You have an affair and you get a BMW. I only have a couple of affairs and I only get a bicycle. Why the huge disparity?"<br><br>The 2nd man replied: "Count yourself lucky. I just saw your wife go by on roller skates."<br><br>======================================<br><br>This little boy walks into a whorehouse with fifty buck in one hand, and a dead duck in the other. He walks up to the madam, and tells her he wants to buy the nastiest, cheesiest, sluttiest whore she's got! The madam, a little taken back by this, asks the little boy why he would want such a thing. So he tells her he wants to catch the herpes. She asks him what for?<br><br>So he tells her, that he wants to catch the herpes, so he can go home and give them to his sister. The madam, totally flabbergasted, asks him to repeat what he just said.<br><br>So he says, "ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s right! I want to catch the herpes, so I can go home and give them to my sister, then she can give them to my dad, then he can give them to my mom and then my mom can give them to the mailman, cause thatÃ¢Â€Â™s the son of a bitch that killed my duck!!!"<br><br>=====================================<br><br>Six of the seven dwarfs are sitting around the house one day when Sleepy rushes in and says, "Guess what guys, I've won a trip to see the Pope!" Everyone gets all excited and chants, "We finally get to ask him, we finally get to ask him."<br><br>The next day, they are standing in front of the Pope, Dopey out in front of the other six. All the other six start pushing Dopey and saying, "Go ahead, Dopey, ask him, ask him!"<br><br>The Pope looks at Dopey and asks, "Do you have a question to ask me, young man?" Dopey looks up shyly and says, "Well, yes." The Pope tells him to go ahead and ask. Dopey asks, "Well, do....do they have nuns in Alaska?" The Pope replies, "Well, yes, I'm sure we have nuns in Alaska."<br><br>The others all keep nudging Dopey and chanting, "Ask him the rest, Dopey, ask him the rest!" The Pope asks Dopey if there's more to his question, and Dopey continues, "Well, uh, do they have, uh, black nuns in Alaska?" To which the Pope replies, "Well, my son, I think there must be a few black nuns in Alaska, yes."<br><br>Still not satisfied, the others keep saying, "Ask him the last part, Dopey, ask him the last part!" The Pope asks Dopey, "Is there still more to your question?" To which Dopey replies, "Well, uh, yeah.....are there, uh, are there any midget black nuns in Alaska?" The startled Pope replies, "Well, no, my son, I really don't think there are any midget black nuns in Alaska."<br><br>At this, Dopey turns all kinds of colors, and the others start laughing, and yelling, "Dopey screwed a penguin, Dopey screwed a penguin!"</div>
