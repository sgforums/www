              <p>Yeah I agree with the top. Most small businesses's bosses nowadays think their main duty is to get as much into their own pockets, even though their biggest responsibility is to their employees. This is why Singapore's entrepreneurs are so weak. <br><br>I can't wait for 2016 as well.</p>

              <p>True that. GCT was quite straight forward, and un-snake-like. I remember him saying stuff like how people can come here to work under good infrastructure, and add to our economy in return. Then when they are retired, they can fark off to their homelands instead of staying here and messing up our socio-economic balance. </p>
              <p>But that was Goh's time. Then our Mai Hum came and changed it to make them stay here as citizens. Kena sai rdy. </p>

              Let's be realistic and practical. Singaporeans are not Japanese,
              
              Community and national pride does not take first place.  Everyone from top to bottom are commercial minded and profit centred and short term thinking!.  For your suggestion to work , Singaporeans must together have very strong community spirit and national pride, and a willingness to sacrifice short term gains for longer term benefit of the nation and community.
              
              You can't expect employees to work  harder and feel a sense of loyalty to the Singaporean employer and pride in being employed by  Sinapore employer/company  etc if they are treated like dirt  and paid substandardly even if the company can afford to do better.  The  attitude and  culture of employers are mostly only profit motivated...so the work ethics of the Singaporean employees these days  is "  don't do more than necessary . There is no  sense of loyalty  or pride in working for a Singaporean or a  Singapore owned company,  unless you are paid your money's worth! 
              
              Inany organisation, everything begins at the very top.  If even leaders of society  feel they must always be paid their Shylock's worth, where is national  pride? Don't expect  the poor cleaner  in the food court or the toilet cleaner to lead by example instead...

              Of course the government must lead ....not merely follow  or else how to justify  the amounts they are paid to lead? But  not only must a government lead effectively, take credit  where it is due. BUT more importantly ,  it must also be accountable  for mistakes made and be able to take responsibility too.  Now that is the difficult part  isn't it?
