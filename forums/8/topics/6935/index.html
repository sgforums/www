            <div class='col-md body'>Used by gals??? Share yur encounters guys... This is my experience...<br><br>Well, I'll share my encounter I had with a gal. She's actually once my schoolmate and was my first love in Sec One. Problem is, we broke up after 7 months.<br><br>Last year, we met up after several months of mail exchanging, e-mailing, etc. Remember Episode I of Star Wars? Well, I invited her to join me and she readily agreed.<br><br>We had about 4 months of great fun during which we went to catch the National Day parade LIVE! It was also that day I FIRST took the initative to hold a girl's hand. The feeling's... indescribable  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> She didn't resist! I was sooo happy....<br><br>Good things don't last long, however. Though my buddy encouraged me to pop THE question of she being my steady gf 'officially' during the fireworks display. I'd never had the guts to do so...<br><br>Well, after that, she claimed to have lots of work in her company and I didn't mind but fetched her home after work. I even waited for at least an hour for her! I could think nothing but her and was so delighted to see her when she settled her work.<br><br>I finally asked her the question of her being my girlfriend over the phone one day. She kept quiet initially and then said that she don't want to suffer from another heartpain from a broken relationship and it's better OFF IF WE REMAINED AS FRIENDS!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> I was horrified by those words... After putting in SO much effort, I expected very little, but she juz popped me that answer of being juz friends!!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>After reflecting on all the conversation between us, I realised that she's always busy with something whenever I called her. Whenever we went out, she would insist on paying for her own share (as a guy I would definitely pay for her) but would not make an attempt to return me the money. Even way b4 the Star Wars movie I went out wif her, I told her that I've gotten tickets to the<br>NDP 99, I've asked her if she wanted to go and she sighed and said: "Oh... I've not been to NDP for ten years already"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>The thought of it makes me really MAD!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>--------------------------------------------<br>To my dear buddy (u know who u are), if u're reading this post, juz to tell u that it's TRUE and I am NOT BULLSHITTING.<br><br>Really sorry that I've not heeded yur advice and not communicate wif her at all.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jeff<br>So you are blaming the girl after she has rejected you and u began to dig out the 'past' saying that she may be sponging on you and as such? In the game of relationship, nothing is fair. We lost some and we regain some...Did u dare to say not that u enjoyed the feelings with her and also have given u some happy memories as well? We thrive on good memories and I believe u feel sore becos she wants to remain frens and I think u should respect her decision...Nothing is perfect in the game of chasing...Girls can do lotsa stuffs for the guys but they seldom utter a single word of complaint and still do it willingly in despite of rejections and as such...Since u have got a good memeory to withold , why dun u stop being so annoyed and get on with life..she is not the only girl in SG, right?<br>At least, she is frank about her feelings..rather than to leave u hanging there...So live and let live, dun ponder too much because of a gal, it is not worth the effort and time.<br>And remember, u did say that u are willingly to pay for her...maybe u are just concerned about the double standards she is portraying when she say you want to pay,,that I anm not sure..it is her character somehow..but did u say that you are going to treat her anyway?<br><br>------------------<br>We have no right to ask when sorrow comes, "Why did this happen to me?" unless we ask the same question for every moment of happiness that comes our way.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 11 April 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would not say you are used, I would rather say that right from the very beginning you thought of it as an <strong>exchange</strong>. If you are to give, you would not have expected anything to come back in the first place. With the hope of exchanging her love with your your money and time, it is already an exchange isn't it? You are feeling used now for you did not get what you expected back, and thus a failed trade. If you are to give without the rhought od aything coming back to you, you would not have felt used at all, and why do you feel used only after the incident? Is it resentment? I do not know for only tou can answer this, but one thing to note, answer this with truth, and it does not pay to bluff yourself. For you would never get the correct answer.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><blockquote>If you do not expect anything back when you give, that would be true giving.</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm.. this reminded of myself. I had been a fool before and even now I felt being a fool at times. Actually it's all in the mind. How you want things to be. Dun do things or decide base on your impulse. Do what you feel is best for you, or just do what you want. It's your life, no one can force you to do something you dun like. If you want to give, give it graciously.<br><br>Sometimes, pple dun love us back the way we want them to, but that doesn't mean that they dun love us. If you feel that she is the one, just go for it.. regardless of the outcome.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm, seems to me the problem is people reading signals wrongly. just temper expectations with common sense.<br><br>007:<br>i don't know you and i hope you don't take my advice the wrong way ok? the reason why you feel so annoyed is because the mentality you had made you think you had a RIGHT to something, i.e.,<br><br>1. did she ask you to fetch her from work or did you do it on your own accord?<br><br>2. 'After putting in SO much effort, I expected very little'<br>- on the contrary, i think you expected a lot. everything you did, from calling her to NDP tickets to star wars, you expected 'something' to happen. don't take it out on her just because what you wanted did not materialise.<br><br>hey, i'm sorry things didn't work out. we all deserve a little better but don't always get what we want, and sometimes that's a bitter pill to swallow. but don't take it out on her or women in general ok?  wishing you all the best next time round...<br><br>cheerio.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yup, move on... there're lots of girls out there. Justice is never found in the game of dating, you win some , you lose some... that's dating. Ultimately, no winner nor loser emerge. You gain some but you lose some. That's the rule of the game. I'm sure there're girls out there who would like you for who you are and what you do. I'm not saying that this girl is not worth all the trouble but since she already made clear that she only wants to be friends, then find another girl who's worth the effort. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Since she doesn't appreciate all that you have done, then it's her loss. But at the same time, don't make it seem as if everything is her fault. You will just be perceived as a petty man who can't afford to lose. Take on a generous role and forgive her. After love is not about receiving but giving!<br><br>Hope you feel better!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jeff,<br><br>Well, I guess the above thoughts, comments &amp; advice thus speaks the truth... On the conclusion, if U really love her, U will not had felt such unhappiness in U... Coz U will respect her thoughts &amp; decisions... Guess U don't really like her that deep...<br><br>She readily agreed on watching the show maybe she's interested in the show as well...<br><br>As 4 holding hands in NDP, where did U hold her hand? During the performance or when U R trying 2 leave the stadium?<br><br>If its in the performance, its might juz that U tried &amp; she don't 1 2 hurt U but allow U 2 do so coz its juz holding handss lor... Or maybe holding hands is no big deal 2 her which U thought is a big deal? U never know...<br><br>If it happened while leaving, she allowed probably its juz U &amp; her &amp; she does not 1 2 get separated, spending time looking 4 each other... I believe U do know that there R lots of people in the NDP...<br><br>She might really been busy with her work &amp; U juz called at the wrong timing... Maybe what she said might be the truth...<br><br>2 my understanding of what U had mentioned, there R not much of hints left by her that she liked U or even thinking of having a relationship with U...<br><br>If U really like her, stick by her, be with her...Let U be the friend she can look 4 when she's down with sadness or up with joy... be patient, she'll understand &amp; might be touched by Ur deep understanding.....<br><br>Don't expect 2 much coz she might juz really 1 U as a friend onli. Love is giving &amp; not receiving...<br><br>if U find that U don't really have such deep feeling 4 her, get a life...stop letting it bother U.....<br><br>------------------<br>Life is 2 short 2 be unhappy!

            <div class='col-md body'>shouldn't that be in singular form? used and cheated by "gal", bcos only one?<br><br>ah, nvm.<br><br>Well...I had something similiar to that. It was this girl, we met at a camp, went out together after that. And at one point we started touching. The thing is, I was feeling kind of guilty...I mean we're already having physical contact. In front of her friends, with each other. We should be a couple. Oddly, physical contact has always come first before proposal in all my relationships so far. But once I asked her (to be my gf) she like went thru the let's just be friends routine. Around this point, I didn't act too desperate. Somehow, I felt like asking why and trying to be understanding, but all I said was, "you're not sure...call me back in 2 weeks and tell me again...". We eventually got together as a couple and did more than hold hands. It was a great learning experience. The thing is, sometime later after V-Day, after I got her expensive perfume and all...she asked for a breakup. Around here I knew I couldn't press it anymore, so well...I just relented. Nothing much I could say anymore.<br><br>I don't know what I learnt from that...should I try harder or what?<br><br>The thing is...whatever happens...next time I'm NOT going to pop the question of gf or not just because there already is physical contact. Maybe that moment is meant to be savoured for longer than thought so that progression to the next level is more natural, and successful.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well,actually I also have one very sad incident to mention!About 1 yrs + ago,one of my secondary schoolmate called me to chat with me as she was bored.(Actually I liked her when I was in secondary school,I was a first yr student in Poly when she called me)<br>We had a good chat,then she started to call me around once per fortnight.Once,she asked me to catch a movie with her,I was so happy!Thinking that I could catch a movie with the girl I like.So I said that I will call her again to confirm the date.When I called her up a few days later to confirm the time,place,etc.....She said that she might not be able to go as she got a project to handle,then I told her that it is okay if she is busy,but she said that she would call me one day later to confirm with me.I waited for her call patiently,but the phone call never came.She don't call me anymore since that day.I felt quite sad!!!She was the one that proposed us to catch the show together,but she don't even bother to give me a call to reply me,nor did she apologised to me for standing for out.<br>Recently,I got in touch with one of my secondary schoolmates,she told me that the girl I liked already has a very steady bf.Alhought I have been angry with her since that day,I suddenly feel so sad when I heard that.........</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sounds to me like you might be taking things a little too seriously.<br><br>Also, wait for call things are rather odd. Sometime I don't bother to call to cancel, because it's not as if you're already at the place waiting for her...you're at home...you can go anywhere else if she doesn't call.<br><br>And why didn't you call her when she stopped calling? You know ar, girl call...is giving a lot of face alledi...you should also call ark!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

(dun take it personally please)<br>I think it is simply a person's responsibility to inform the other party if he/she would like to cancel the appointment. Cos the other party might have cancel his/her other appointments for you and waiting. It is just irresponsible and taking things for granted.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Do you think it matters a lot if you were to do things you enjoy doing for the girl you have affection for and didn't receive anything. Sometimes, it's the time, the situation that prevent her from showing her affection. She might not be ready now, but if you really love her and want it to work out, you should persevere. So long she is still positive about it, there is always a chance for you to work out.<br><br>Why give up on something that you want? If you never try, you will never know the outcome. Life is full of surprises, so long you are true to someone, it's just a matter of time when something happen. It might not always be good, but there is always the possibility no matter how small.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How about this one:<br><br>When I was a teenager in Canada back in '87, I went out quite often with this girl from Hong Kong.  I was living in an apartment with my housemate.<br><br>I used to pick her up from downtown and school to send her home which was about 30km from my own apartment since I lived downtown, bring her out for dinners etc. I even let her use my car when her mom uses hers (which was quite often).<br><br>The girl and I then went steady for about 3 months.  One day, I came home and found her in my apartment.  She walked out of my housemate's room in a bathrobe.<br><br>I asked her what was going on but she kept quiet about it. So did my housemate.  But one evening when I was talking to her on the phone, she played back a recording of a conversation she had with my housemate.  He said that what they were doing was wrong but he couldn't help it.<br><br>After that, in school, I confronted him and he lost his temper and wanted to pick a fight with me.  He even provoked me with a chair and asked me to stab him as he knew I kept a knife in my car.  I just shook my head and told him that he wasn't worth it.<br><br>Till today, I still can't believe that the two of them had been f***ing behind my back in my apartment (tho it was his room) and he even had the guts to try to pick a fight with me. Well, I hoped that they were happy together but apparently, they broke up about half a year later and it was quite an ugly scene.<br><br>I found out later that she was quite materialistic as she would go for guys that are rich. Apparently, she went out with me coz I drove a 'nice' car. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Talk about getting burned...<br><br>------------------<br>Love and kisses on all your Pink Parts</div>
