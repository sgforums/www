Waste no time on this kind of guys, as he will finally get what he deserved, in no time. Indeed, he is a bastard, but too bad i do not know him. I hate it when guys cheats on the feeling of gers, same for the gers doing the same to the guy too.<br><br>I can fully understand how you feel, as if its in my veins, pumping as my blood flow through them. I know that although he is already ur ex, but u r still angry, not over him, but over this incident. However, it take this kind of pple to make other pple see how life works. Life sux, thanks to these pple, and i am glad that u had pull the prank on him. But pls dont consider to interfer in this matter regarding him anymore, as it would leads to more trouble if he knows that its u behind the curtains.<br><br>Hope u will treasure the next guy u may be together with, and in fact, it kind of make ur expectation or ur next bf lower, thanks to him, and cheers to the guys out there. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br></div>
