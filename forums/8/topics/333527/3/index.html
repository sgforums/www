              <p>those china students, esp those scholars are not that poor lor.</p>
              <p>they are among the best in China (perhaps not academically, but certainly from well-to-do families). because their families are wealthy enough to spam tuition for them back in China, they are then able to qualify for singapore scholarship. have been there for immersion programme before, the parents there simply hire private 1 to 1 home tutors for every subjects, and that certainly isn't cheap.</p>
              <p>the ordinary peasant-born prc will never be able to afford coming to singapore, regardless of whether he got scholarship or not.</p>
              <p>most of them do get allowance from family, in addition to the $500 allowance so generously given to them by our government.</p>
              <p>in addition, they don't have to pay for food and accomodation here in singapore either, since that too is sponsored by the government.</p>
              <p>so, these teens have more purchasing power than the avg singaporean teen.</p>
              <p>ask yourself, if you are a parent : did you give enough allowance to your children that they are able to buy tissue from any random uncle/aunty they saw?</p>
              <p>if you are a student : did your parents give you enough allowance to buy tissue paper whenever you saw one of those tissue-sellers?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br>it's so untrue, the chinese student in the private institution here is from wealthy family, not whose who is in NTU or NUS, they are from average family, if they are not qualified for the scholarship, they cannot afford to study in singapore</p>
              <p>Yes, some of you are not comfortable with the 500$ issued by singapore government, but if the local student is qualified for the scholarship, i guarantee you, the local student will be choosen rather than the chinese.</p>
              <p>In NTU and NUS, those in the lab pursuiting under graduate and Phd, majority of them are foreigner, and most of the foreigner come from china, without them the NTU and NUS will be short of high education student, so the point is not government give them the allowance for free, it's with condition, and it's win win resolution, some chinese scholar who break the bond is not right, but think they come here without any familiar people around, someone have to try hard to integrate in the society, food and climates</p>
              <p>And many student's scholarship are terminated because they are not doing well in the local university acedemically, and there are some portion who have been sent back to china, leaving them with no choice, they have to retake the national entrance exam to admitted in a china university.</p>
              <p>Scholarship is everywhere, as long as you do well acedemically, it's not difficult to get it here, or somewhere else, whose who break the bond is small portion, and singapore government here have oversee that problem, they are still benifitting with whose who don't not break the bond,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i think it's the MOE who treat chinese scholar like tissue paper, if they can get advantage of them, which mean the scholar who do well acedemically, then stay, whose, who fail several subject, out.</p>

              <p><br>I suppose you meant 4 mil in terms of population.</p>
              <p>A majority of these donations come from larger local and foreign organisations. Reason it being it's good PR and added awareness, as well as coporate taxation relief that can work out to be a huge sum.</p>
              <p>In fact, in response to the OP, I know several Chinese PRCs that can speak better English than most Singaporeans. They have that sexy American accent as well, most likely because they have learnt from American teaching materials.</p>

              <p>Its not an insult for all chinese, if you think its an insult, then its an insult. Its just another alternative to using the term 'PRC'.

              <p>I've had an encounter in downtown fastfood outlet that seems to break all stereotype about rich china teens studying here that they are loud and proud.</p>
              <p>It's my teabreak  time so decided to have acuppa of coffee..a middle aged uncle came in selling tissue..Sg youths give him a kind of look and waved him off...</p>
              <p>Surprisingly a china teen couple bought some tissues from him..what does this show?40 years of nation building and we pride ourselves as developed city state and yet can't spared a dollar or two to help the poor sg uncle...we criticise china kids but are sg kids more altustic towards poorer members of our countrymen..think about it:(</p>
              <p>So what if sgkids  speak better english than china kids now...in a decade or so they will too be billingual in their own cities maybe even better without the singlish</p>

              <p>I usually buy all the tissues from the uncles or aunties and give away all the tissues to my friends.</p>
              <p>Not many people can do that, regardless of where they come from, be it sg or china.</p>
              <p>So I'm better than those china teens right? Even if you don't say, I also know I'm better. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>You can call a piece of shit a rose, but it is still a piece of shit.</p>
              <p>Likewise, that which you call a rose, by any other name, would smell as sweet.</p>
              <p>Its not an insult for all chinese, if you think its an insult, then its an insult. Its just another alternative to using the term 'PRC'. Or, if you like, you can use both, ie "In geylang, when driving, one must be careful as many PRC cheena like to jaywalk dangerously" and so on and so forth.</p>
