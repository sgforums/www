              <p>Put it this way lah.  This China couple has come a long way from their homeland and endured hardships that you and I may not be able to comprehend.

              <p>very often when we talk about people from a country actually it's not a nation-level thing but only personality. why r guys always so eager to relate somebody's behavior to his/her motherland? this is likely to cause bias because stereotyping is always in favor of your in-group. if u see a china mainlander doing good things u even won't know he's from china, while when he behaves badly it'll be ur basic instinct to say china men are all evil.</p>
              <p>so try to avoid saying "china ppl blah blah blah" or "singaporeans what what what" if u can. all are individual humans.</p>

              <p>Put it this way lah.  This China couple has come a long way from their homeland and endured hardships that you and I may not be able to comprehend.
