            <div class='col-md body'>I take mine utmostly seriously. Sometimes things ends in break-ups because the other party might find happiness with others, why sometimes it's actually a pity cause a couple could fall out over trivial matter. It's an ego thing.<br><br>But then again, as a teenager, I've seen lots of other teenager going "for the experience". The more relationship they have been, the more "experienced" they are supposed to be, and less easier to get hurt in the future.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well as I have seen so far,<br>most teen relationship are just for the fun of it.<br><br>There are many teens out there who mainly go into a relationship because they have the feeling that, their friends have a boyfriend/girlfriend and if I don't have one, I feel odd. Peer pressure or maybe we can call it "kiasuism".<br><br>There are of course some who are serious with each others but it will be a long road down if they decide to stay together till the day they get married. However, few have considered the fact that during their teenage year, one's mentality will change and might not be as naive as when they were younger. As their mentality change, they may find their companion being not the image of the perfect bf/gf they are looking for.<br><br>Some regards bf/gf as just a fling. I used to be like that but now I feel a long term relationship would be a better choice as you know your love one will always stand by you.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the following is applicable to not just Singaporeans, but teenagers all over.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Generally, most teenagers get invovled in BGR (Boy Girl Relationships for the clueless)because out of a sudden interest of the opposite sex, sparked by puberty. It's hard to take a relationship seriously at such age as they might not be mature yet. Still, I won't say that it's impossible to have serious relationships from teen years.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I dunno about "love" kind of thing but one thing for sure for one of the reason is that when both had sex...if no special stunt apply....beri fast will break off. So no serious love,only business involve. If real love won't commit sex before marriage. And maybe one of them is too impulsive and want a gf/bf NOW!!!! so anyhow take then awhile later...break again.<br>PEaCe((((((((<br><br>------------------<br>Â®To The Maximum Limit Of My LifeÂ®</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let's face it,when teens start having a relationship,they fall in love with the idea of falling in love,they do not fully understand the whole concept of falling in love and only see the good side of live eg someone to care for you,buy you stuff etc etc and fail to see that relatioship also need loving care as it means being around for your loved one when it is need.They also lack the maturity and level headedness(if there's sucha word,hehee) to see things to see things in a mature way(of cos some adults also behave that way,heheeh).In the end,teenage relationships hardly survive in the long term as once they gone out into the world,they will realise what they are missing out although i know of a few teenage relationships that ended up in marraige,but these are in the minority  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Eating is a form of enjoyment <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">~~~~~~~~</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Botom line, I feel that most teenagers just go into BGR due to curiousity. There are of course some that are serious (like some of you mentioned, mentality and maturity are factors) But not so much. Out of a group of 40 people, seems like maybe onli 5 or less would be serious ones. And even so, some of them would still end-up in breakup cases due to an inability to sustain the relationship for long periods of time (inexperience, maybe?)<br><br></div>
