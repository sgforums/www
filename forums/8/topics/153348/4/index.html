Public shaming of litterbugs via CWO has been done,this racists behaviour is so much more serious, hence the public shaming they are getting is pretty acceptable in my viewpoint. Now we can see for ourselves how strong their confidence in their racist opinions would be when no longer hidden behind the Internet.<br><span style="color: red;"><br>Aren't you even a little concerned about those kids?<br>17 years old and you are putting his personal life at risk!</span>INHUMANE!<br></div></blockquote><span style="color: red;"><br>Mind you , 17 years old kid and he's like so young and vulnerable.<br>He's too young to even know what is the harm of racism.<br><br>And a kid's life gets destroyed because of it?<br><br>Hello ?

Why do whites, hispanics, blacks  and asians have differences overseas?The issue is racism is an overreaction to one's lost of familiarity. Like i have mentioned, the majority has no issues between races, its just the handful..if it was true as you mentioned, racism is caused by the history so called, then would it be a more public issue?<br><br>I personally have no issue with Durai earning big bucks considering he was doing a great job getting money in for the kidney patients..the point was that Durai was publicly shamed, and well so are these racists. And given the nature of the offences, i don't see why you should complain against the racists being shamed, when even durai was potrayed on the newspapers.<br><br>Public shaming for litterbugs..hmm..well, they litter,they get caught, they get shamed.Public shaming for racists, they make racist statements,they get caught, they get shamed. I do not see littering as a big big issue, but racism..hello?!! Given the severity of their actions, they should face up to the punishment.<br><br>The beauty of the release of their photos is that, these individuals made public announcements of their racist opinions, being public, they were drawing attention to themselves. They have gotten what they wanted, more public attention, and what better than to be showcased on the national papers.<br><br>SPH has done no wrong,their duty is simply to report, and well the mistakes were done by the racists themselves,there were no court injunctions to prevent the release of their photos,which i'm sure they could have requested if they had wanted.If they did not want their lives to be destroyed,they should have thought before they made their racists remarks.<br><br>PS. You wrote too much for me to reply to...and anyways, you are entitled to your opinions as much as me to mine,you may feel my opinions silly, just as i do to yours. I do not know if you are making arguments for the sake of it or because you feel strongly, but your opinions are basically focussed on the direct result of the whole saga on the individuals who were charged, while my opinions are that with respect to the good of society in general.Given the two views, there would be pros and cons,but yea..i prefer to screw the few for the betterment of the society at large.<br><br>Cheers<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hidden arrests create an air of mystery behind the whole saga, and well word will still go around, and in that scenario, with the mystification of these characters, they could even be seen as heroes. Making the offenders accessible to public, not only acts as a deterrent, but helps the public realise that racists exists amongsts us, and we cannot tell who they are by simply looking at them or anything.It creates a real environment , and allows for the public to realise the issue which is imbedded in the minds of some amongst us.<br><br>What we have in singapore is a case of many whom are not racists per se, but more like people with a half chance of turning out that way. The fear is that these offenders would sow the seeds of discontent amongst the silent majority, and lead to public opinion being swayed.Hence, sure we we may miss out on the very very few hardcore racists, but for those whom are swaying in the wind with regards to the issues, these government actions would be a strong gust of wind pushing them the right way. I would think this is the large proportion that the gahmen is trying to keep unpoisoned by the racists opinions.<br><br>Jail does wonders, a little jail time..even 2 weeks, would help make the realisation of the gravity of racism, especially in our multi-ethnic setting, become apparent. If jail cannot help these individuals, counselling definitely won't. Do you not remember in your schooling days how students would laugh and joke about counselling as a punishment, because it simply is not!Spare the rod and spoil the child i'd say. Counselling would work only in certain cases, when someone is really misguided, however,what if any of these three were to simply go through the motions of counselling, and eventually laugh off the whole experience and still harbour the same feelings. It would make a ridicule of the justice system, and lead young impressionable kids to feel, that racism is a minor thing, and not even deserving of a true punishment.<br><br>Of course, on a personal level, as the way you see it, jail would only cause angst and bla bla, but if one was truly repentant, he would come out better from it, and counselling would enhance his recovery from his sickness,racism.</div>

What i am saying is that if the fella wants to repent from his misttakes, and actually realises the wrong he has done, some jail time would help serve as a strong reminder to him that what he has done was indeed wrong. However, maybe i'm simply cold, but i doubt that racism is something you can either beat out of someone,or talk out of someone. It is all just to utopian, i feel the three will remain having feeling of discontent towards malays, but since that were the case, punish them so that they remember that it is wrong. And even if they have the racism within them, they would learn not to act on their racist intentions. This is very much like teaching an animal a trick,you could reward them when they do good, or punish them when they do bad, eventually they will learn..<br></div>
