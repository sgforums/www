            <div class='col-md body'>Well,to all,<br><br>Do you think that there is love at first sight? You know, like all hollywood romance movies, people tell the opposite sex,"I was attracted by you like love at first sight, and blah blah blah...."<br><br>In my opinion, there does not exist love at first sight, rather I would prefer to call that "lust at first sight". The first reason is that you do not know the person, and you are just judging from an appearance. Didn't your teacher always tell you that you should never judge a book by its cover? Well, if there is ever love, it is cultivated through time... That is why I don't believe in this love at first sight idea...<br><br>What about you?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Haha, Prodigal, are you inspired by my posting on "Sleepless In Seattle" ??<br><br>well, Mariah Carey sings "Love Takes Time" and I do believe love takes time.<br><br>Our testosterone runs high during our teenage years and that is when we fall in "Lust" so easily. When you grow older, your hormonal level will drop and you will find that you feel more "love" than "lust". It's biological. We are created to be like that haha. Quite sad though. But scientifically, without lust, our human race would have gone extinct long time ago.<br><br>Btw, it is interesting to know that during our teenage years, the hormonal levels are very different between f and m. But as we age, they fall to the SAME level. And our sex hormones affect our behaviour. Some scientists use this fact to explain why old people tend to argue less.<br><br>Our eyes are on our face, our hearts are hidden in our body. Which sees better ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>about judging the book by its cover, so is loving the cover lust?  isn't it a kind of paradox?  Can't I take one look at the person and love his face and looks and love him because of that?  Maybe I've been looking for a guy who is real good with animals and children and to me this characteristic is the *most* important of all and one day I see this guy in the zoo teaching children about animals, playing and laughing with them?<br><br>Love has never been defined as something that takes time to *be*, some people may find it so but it doesn't mean that love always has to obey mariah carey.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There are no absolutes. This is a chicken and the egg question.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Lust equals Love/Romance</span><br><br>One of my equations, for the question. E.g. When you french kiss, there is lust, but it is the lust that makes a french kiss so romantic, so passionate. It creates love. Is it not so? *Looks at Maya* Likewise, it is love that the french kiss is so lustful, and with love comes lust. So is it love or lust that cause french kiss to be so romantic and passionate and which comes first? I say they come together. Thus just like Love/Lust at first sight, they are a package. Love at first sight consititude the element of lust just like lust includes love. Lust is the fuel, while love is the driver. Or love can be the fuel and lust be the driver. It all depends on which direction you are heading in the relationship.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Lust not equals Love/Romance</span><br><br>There can be pure love, even at first sight. Find this familiar?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">....I am in love with her..I do not know why...she is not pretty, she is not sexy....but I just love her and I do not know why...have we ever met? No I guess not...maybe in my dream...but she just seem so fine for me.</span><br><br>A typical love at first sight declaration. And of course there are many an example which we have seen. Emotions is a very funny gear in our life. It can drive us towards directions which we seldom expect to go.<br><br>There is also lust at first sight which is of course a lot more common. Classic examples could be found along Geylang Lorong 23. Lust is too a unexplained feeling that can make a human being do stupid things.<br><br>In conculsion, there are no absolutes, different events in different situations, can lead to different results for a same person.<br><br>------------------<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Just my $0.02 + $0.03(from Lex) worth</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MayaJade,<br><br>You are not wrong.<br><br>The best lover that anymore can have is one that attracts you both physically (lust) and emotionally (love). That will be very ideal.<br><br>And some people think nothing is absolute. But by making this sentence ("nothing is absolute") you are alredi making an ABSOLUTE statement.<br><br>Well, we are never taught what love is. Ask your teachers in school and every single one will give you a different answer. We are left to learn wat love is all by ourselves. There is no syllabus for love. So whatever we conclude about love, depends on what we had experienced in our lives. Since we have different experiences, we have different definitions  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>love at first sight? i wished. this only happens in the movies. pleeasseee, i don't even know him from Adam, how could i have loved him? the romantic in me wishes that it could happen to me but the sceptic in me says, yeah right.<br><br>lust at first sight? this is more credible. one can lust after another through their sheer physical beauty, their great warm voice, their intelligence, their compassion, the way they smile or laugh or even the way they move. falling in lust with another is way more common than falling in love.<br><br>i'm still praying &amp; hoping to God that it'll be a love at first sight thing for me &amp; my future hubby, but somehow i get the feeling, it'll be a gradual thing, the type of love that kind of creeps up on you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, CCP<br><br>Surely, this thread requires not background since it concerns our everyday life... Hence you do not need research, because it is irrelevant.<br><br>Hmm, I am not sure whether you are talking about both sides of the same coin. Because I can take the electrifying feeling to be a lustful feeling and similarly, the feeling of sexual desires falls under the same category. If that is what Terence wanted me to do it for him, since he want to sleep, I guess that this is the problem...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, LittleMan,<br><br>Not really, I was making fun of someone in the pub that day when I was at Oxford to visit my friends, and a caucasian gal was talking about the love at first sight and I argue out with her that I don't believe in love at first sight. I am not being cynical as Terence would see my points earlier from the initial post, since I have a personal grudge against cynicism. But I think the point is that people mixed up feelings of love and lust all the time.<br><br>I liked Mariah Carey's song, and I believe that "love takes time to heal when it is hurting so much..." I think that was the only nice song that she ever sang. Love do take time, and lust takes a second, with a person's looks and figure to start with.<br><br>Sometimes, I think it is triggered by certain chemical reactions of our genes to give us such feelings of lust or maybe love. But then again, I am more inclined to see that there is some meaning about existence...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, MayaJade,<br><br>First of all, there is nothing wrong in having lust on something, i.e. it is human to be lustful. I would be suffering from a serious case of psychological or physiological disease if I don't "drop saliva" when I see a pretty gal pass by my way in town. Of course, there is a interaction when you see something appealing, and you want to own it if it looks nice. Hence that feeling is lust. A lot of people seem to see that lust only exists when I want to have sex with someone. That is not the case, because lust is the feeling which you possess when u start carving for something. So, with the analogy of the book, there is no paradox, if you extend lust beyond sexual desires. Like I say always, love and lust belongs to Desire and Desire is always cruel..<br><br></div>
