            <div class='col-md body'>As to why eagle not bomb dragon, I personally think it does not solve the problem. Because he told his children eagles not to eat worm and they'll die.

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually I dun think its test more like free-will. Someone made a remark once, if love is void of free-will then its not love. Moreover conclusions abt eagle cannot never be drawn from one book, must look at book1&amp;2.
