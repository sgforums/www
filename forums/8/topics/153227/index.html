Even prisoners don't get solitary confinement if they're well-behaved!<br><br>We Singaporeans have an extremely poor record of taking care of our maids, sad to say.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its true that some maids go out and make trouble where they should not. But those are exceptions rather than norms. Out of the so many maids, what is the percentage that have gone astray?<br><br>And I find it extremely true that most Singaporeans do treat their maids badly. I overheard a lady wearing business wear looking refined chatting to her fren in a cafe and she says she scold her maid stupid because she broke a tray of eggs and went on to say she pay so much money to suffer and nag and nag. I nearly wanted to go over and spit at her but my friends stopped me.<br><br>Cmon, how much do u pay a maid? Seriously, if i were to pay a Singaporean that kind of pay, which Singaporean can take that kind of working hours and work?<br><br>I have a maid at home and we make sure the least we can do is to treat her as a human and let eat with us, watch TV with us after her work is done. She gets her day off but  if we really need her on that day off, like all employers should do, we compensate her like as in doing OT.<br><br>I cant believe these people who says dun give day off. If you had a bad experience, fine, maybe u need some convincing but those who just wanna say something....please, try going overseas to work for years and leaving your family behind and tell me that the life of a maid is good.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its quite contradicting.....<br><br>Firstly.. like us.. maids are humans too.. and they do not work from 9 to 6.. but longer hours than us... and getting paid peanuts... i really mean peanuts...not 600K....they should really be given some rest time..<br><br>BUT......<br><br>when they go out...... all kinda stuffs happens....like what that was mentioned earlier on by another fellow forumer...<br><br>Maybe thats why employers would rather vote to keep their maids at home.. to avoid any unecessary trouble...e.g police come knocking at ur door, telling you, ur maid is suspected of murdering another maid, in YOUR house.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There is a reason why they are called MAIDS. Blame no one..but urselves ! If u can do ur chores urself..none of this will happen. The poor souls wouldve continued thier pitiful existence back in Indo doing meager earnings..but thanks to the modern SG girls who cant cook n clean... he he... they get hired to live in nice government flats n in the Developed City of Singapore. This little haven..<br><br>I say no holidays for them. They are already lucky enough to be living n earning SG dollars. Of course if u treat them inhumanely..its like dogs... u guys all seen Danny the Dog ? hehehee...something like that.. sooner or later..they gonna bite ur ass~<br></div>
