            <div class='col-md body'>The Government should make a bigger action, like passing a law or whatever, or else it totally spoils the Singapore image.<br><br>The contract should also state the working hours, the day off, the time curfew for the day off etc. Basic rules.<br><br>I read a comprehension passage about maids working here in my English test (ok dun laugh) but it mentions a few important things<br><br>1) About the "Minimum Age Requirement" set by the garmen:<br><br>Most of the maids coming here are 18 years, sometimes a bit older or younger. However you must think: The older the maid does not always equal better maturity and hence better quality of work. Besides, in Indonesia, normally they get married at around 19.<br><br>Garmen wants older maids because they more matured, can settle down in new environment easier.<br><br>The maids pay to come here to work right? OK...<br><br>Usually the maid works in 2-year contracts. In order to cover the expenses used to come here (based on the peanut pay they get, like $300?), normally they have to work 2 contract cycles (4 years). In order to have profit, they have to work one more cycle, which is 6 years.<br><br>18 + 6 years = 24 years by the time they get back. This will make them become spinsters as they are simple too old to be married (based on the rural society there)<br><br>Therefore many maids come here already married. They work and send the money back to Indonesia.<br><br>2) Maids' day off.<br><br>Without contact with their families in Indonesia, they are totally cut off. Like if you go overseas, you will call your friends/relatives one right? Then? Same reaction with them, as they are also humans.<br><br>If you don't let them off, at least let them call their families. Even the Bangladesh workers who are building your Circle Line in rain and sun, gets to call their families back home.<br><br>3) Treatment of maids.<br><br>You got read the newspapers right? Then you should have read the article about some families with maids, nothing happen to them, but the families trat the maid like their own kin. Some treatment like:<br><br>a) Going out together<br>b) Eating together<br>c) Giving day off<br>d) Respect for them<br>e) Don't frequently scold them, instead patiently teaches them<br><br>See, these treatment tells the maid that you accept them into your family, and once she is settled down into her new environment, she will not be so stressed.<br><br>I hope you consider my post.</div>

However you must think: The older the maid does not always equal better maturity and hence better quality of work. Besides, in Indonesia, normally they get married at around 19.<br><br>Garmen wants older maids because they more matured, can settle down in new environment easier.<br><br>The maids pay to come here to work right? OK...<br><br>Usually the maid works in 2-year contracts. In order to cover the expenses used to come here (based on the peanut pay they get, like $300?), normally they have to work 2 contract cycles (4 years). In order to have profit, they have to work one more cycle, which is 6 years.<br><br>18 + 6 years = 24 years by the time they get back. This will make them become spinsters as they are simple too old to be married (based on the rural society there)<br><br>Therefore many maids come here already married. They work and send the money back to Indonesia.<br><br>2) Maids' day off.<br><br>Without contact with their families in Indonesia, they are totally cut off. Like if you go overseas, you will call your friends/relatives one right? Then? Same reaction with them, as they are also humans.<br><br>If you don't let them off, at least let them call their families. Even the Bangladesh workers who are building your Circle Line in rain and sun, gets to call their families back home.<br><br>3) Treatment of maids.<br><br>You got read the newspapers right? Then you should have read the article about some families with maids, nothing happen to them, but the families trat the maid like their own kin. Some treatment like:<br><br>a) Going out together<br>b) Eating together<br>c) Giving day off<br>d) Respect for them<br>e) Don't frequently scold them, instead patiently teaches them<br><br>See, these treatment tells the maid that you accept them into your family, and once she is settled down into her new environment, she will not be so stressed.<br><br>I hope you consider my post.</div></blockquote>woooooooo<br><br>we use to go out together with the maids last time...<br><br>everytime dad brings us out, they'd go with us <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>and all of us eat the same stuff <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  there is no such thing as my kids get to eat the best. u eat white rice only kinda bull..<br><br>and 1 of them was so close to us, she'd bring us out window shopping at the neighbourhood shopping mall... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
