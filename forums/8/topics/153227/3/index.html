I think our gahmen is trying to make the employer responsible since you all employ them.<br><br>This topic has been brought up a few times in newspaper but I guess the gahmen view is you wan employ foreign worker you make sure you take care of them.

            <div class='col-md body'>What have the human rights organisations and ILO been fighting for?<br>Not only for the right to be employed, but also for having 1 or 2 days off per week and atleast 14 - 21 days of vacation in year and a labour day taking 8 hours. Laws should be passed on this, applying to maids same as to other employees. Humans can't work like machines, humans need rest.<br>Maids are not slaves nor machines. But they do the slave work for peanuts.<br><br>Just imagine you would be a maid. You sure know how you wouldn't like to be treated and how you would like to be treated.<br><br>Freedom is the basic human right. It's their right to do with their day off what they want, to spend it as they want. To go where they want, meet who they want. Or should Singapore get known for abusing human rights?<br>If they make troubles outside, they should take responsibility, be fired. This should make them learn from their own mistakes and don't get involved into troubles next time.<br><br>If the maids would be taken as members of the family, eat with the family, they would feel well in the employing family and wouldn't do any troubles.</div>
