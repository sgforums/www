              <p>LOS ANGELES (AFP) - - A US man who was born a woman before undergoing gender realignment surgery has given birth to a baby girl, US media reported.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Thomas Beatie, who is legally male but decided to keep his female sex organs during chest reconstruction surgery and testosterone therapy, attracted worldwide attention in April after revealing his pregnancy.</p>
              <p>The 34-year-old gave birth to a baby girl at a hospital in Bend, Oregon, on June 29, People Magazine reported Thursday.</p>
              <p>"The only thing different about me is that I can't breastfeed my baby. But a lot of mothers don't," the magazine quoted him as saying.</p>
              <p>It said the girl is Beatie's first child, and he had given birth naturally, not by Caesarean section.</p>
              <p>Beatie, who sports a beard, was dubbed the 'pregnant man' after appearing on Oprah Winfrey's television talkshow to discuss his pregnancy.</p>
              <p>"I feel it's not a male or female desire to have a child. It's a human need. I'm a person and I have the right to have a biological child," he told the chat show queen.</p>
              <p>Beatie's unusual situation first became public when he wrote an article in the leading US gay magazine The Advocate in March, entitled "Labor of Love."</p>
              <p>"To our neighbors, my wife, Nancy, and I don't appear in the least unusual," he wrote, explaining that his wife was unable to have a child after undergoing a hysterectomy.</p>
              <p>So he chose to become pregnant by artificial insemination, he said.</p>
              <p>"Our situation sparks legal, political, and social unknowns," Beatie wrote, adding the couple had experienced opposition from health care professionals, friends and family.</p>
              <p>One doctor refused to treat the couple, after consulting an ethics board.</p>
              <p>"How does it feel to be a pregnant man? Incredible. Despite the fact that my belly is growing with a new life inside me, I am stable and confident being the man that I am," Beatie wrote</p>
