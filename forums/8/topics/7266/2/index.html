ANY careless or not careful mistakes will or would likely result in the dog's death! is it worth it in the end?<br><br>further more, dogs' dun give birth to just one puppy, they give birth to several, and can you imagine such a small dog must bear the pain and torture to give birth to 4-5 puppies??? can u make sure that everyone who wants to breed their dogs will bring them to the vet when their dogs are going to give birth? can u make sure that they are so willing to spend all these money on these dogs???<br><br>If you can make sure that ur dog is going for as many checkups at the vet as like a woman is pregnant and going for regular checkups, that is fine abt breeding then! but how many owners will do such a thing? every visit to the vet will cost a few hundreds, and just to breed the dog, u need to spend a few hundreds to thousand!!!~<br><br>i believe most owners will just leave the poor dog there to struggle with the WHOLE process of labour! how selfish can u get!!!!!!!!!<br><br>Imagine you are pregnant COS PPL FORCE YOU TO BE and when u are giving birth, they refused to send you to the vet but to let you struggle to give birth ALL BY YOURSELF!~ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> [/b]i agree!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Ever read a magazine and it said if you wanted to breed small dog, better leave it to the specialist, Specialist know how to take care and give right treatment to them. One thing , If you are the 1st time having dogs, better not to breed them... Cause lack of experience.

I see some issues about dogs huh?  Well, I think every pregnancy involves the birth-pains and certain risks.  But, its the joy of having or bringing or seeing another life emerge into this world that makes it all worthwhile (can melt most normal ppl's heart in most cases).<br><br>Talked to a few mothers, and was told that the pain is nothing compared to the joy at the moment when a child is borned.  It should apply to animals too, since they are also living things with emotions?  (Not talking about those 'naturally Black-Widow types' though....)<br><br>Of course, if the dog-owner is not dog-lover, then in the first place, why pay so much to get a blardie ex dog such as Jack Russell?  In fact, I think dogs nowadays enjoy life more and are more well taken care of than real humans!  Check out all those vitamins and food they are eating nowadays!!!!<br><br>And if he/she/they are dog-lovers, then they would make the effort to find out more about dog pregnancies and keep a close watch on the dog and finally, bring them for regular check-ups, just like humans right?<br><br>Dun think dog owners will risk having a dead dog in the house with weird looking babies coming out, wondering how to dispose the bodies wat???<br><br>If all pregnancies are risky and must be handled by experts, then next time all pregnant women might as well quit job, stay in hospital/specialists' house from 1st mth til baby is borned.  Yah, then no $$$$ and yet, still chalking up more bills......  Economy bad leh....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Like that arh, I rather go employ some rural country mid-wife and give birth at the field outside my flat.....   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
