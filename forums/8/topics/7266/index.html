Chicken egg?<br><br>Not to be insulting or anything but what makes you think you know enough about dogs to breed them? I've seen hamsters giving birth and none of the ones I've seen died in labor so far. And they're pretty small too. Perhaps the reason why people want to sterilize their dogs is for preventing unwanted babies lying around the house or to curb aggression in territorial males. And you said the puppies are gonna be small but still pose a danger to the mom-dog..let me finish by asking you..did you ever think your mom's pregnancy was 100% safe?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>for those who DO NOT believe that breeding is dangerous for these small dogs, pls read on...<br><br>Breeding a Terrier<br><br>Q: We would like to breed our Jack Russell Terrier but we don't know much about it. Can you help us understand the dangers?<br>A: Breeding is risky business, whether you do it for love or money. If you're doing it for love, you risk losing your bitch and her puppies. If you're doing it for money, you stand to lose a bundle. If you've ever read a book on Canine Reproduction you'll notice that there's 54 pages on what can go wrong, and only one page on what it's like if everything goes well. The risks are very real, and even if everything goes well initially, there are defects that can show up later, causing the eventual death of the puppies. And then there's the minor defects that won't affect the puppy's chance for a happy life, but will cause a financial loss to the breeder, as a refund or replacement will need to be given to the buyer.<br><br>Ask yourself "Why do you want to breed?"<br><br>"Because it would be good for the children to watch a birth, and to play with the puppies as they grow."<br><br>If you want them to watch a litter being born, it's better and easier to find a breeder who will let them get up in the middle of the night to come over and watch the litter being born. However, most children are repulsed by the gory parts of the whelping process, and are all too anxious to avoid watching the miracle of birth you planned for them to see. A litter growing up is often too rowdy for most small children, who are disinterested, or terrified of the leaping creatures with sharp nails and teeth.<br><br>"Because we love our bitch, and want another one just like her."<br><br>The chances that you'll get one "just like her" are slim, indeed! Just because an animal is beautiful doesn't mean that it will produce another beautiful animal.<br><br>"Because everyone who comes to the house sees our bitch, and wants a puppy from her."<br><br>Just wait till your litter of 5 is ready to go to their new homes; watch all those people back out -- with a myriad of excuses like;<br><br>"The kids aren't old enough yet."<br>"The kids are too old now to be bothered taking care of a dog."<br>"We're going to have a baby."<br>"We'll be moving in 3 months -- wait till then."<br>"The rug is too new."<br><br>"Because we really love little puppies"<br><br>You'd better be sure you really love them, because until you have them, you can't fully imagine how much is involved, such as:<br><br>The mess a litter makes. Can you put up with the cleaning that is constantly involved in caring for a litter? There's no way to explain how tired you'll get of scrubbing up after the puppies, their whelping box, the yard, the kennel, or wherever they're kept. They dump their food and water the minute you put it down, step in it, roll in it, and drag it through whatever else may be in the puppy box. With 4 or 5 puppies, there's always something else to be cleaned up, too!<br><br>The responsibility you'll have with a litter. It's not as easy as having the bitch whelp the litter and take care of them until they're ready to go. Much of it is up to you, and you're tied to the litter like any new mother.<br><br>Weigh the positives and the negatives carefully before you decide to breed. And if you're an amateur get the advise of a good veterinarian before you do anything!<br>*extracted from http://www.terrier.com/<br><br>DO NOT BREED<br>if you do not know what you're doing<br>if your intention is not to improve the breed standard<br>if your dog is a beloved family pet and not a show dog<br>if you want to make money<br>if you think breeding is for fun<br>if you think your dog is deprived if she is not bred<br>if you think you and your children will learn from the experience of birth<br>Breeding is not a hobby for pet owners, but rather a demanding, complicated vocation that is not to be dabbled with. Many people have thought of breeding as an easy-money opportunity: buy two dogs and let them do the work. The rule of thumb is: if you're making money by breeding dogs, you're doing something wrong!<br><br>Common sense should tell you that it is indeed cruel to bring unwanted or unplanned puppies into an already crowded canine world; only negligent pet owners allow this to happen. There are too many dogs but too few good homes. Many dogs are put to sleep annually, purebred and mixed breeds, pet-, show- and breeding-quality.<br><br>The motives of good breeders are clear: avoid the manufacturing and mass-producing of average and below-average dogs; control the overblown canine population; concentrate on the improvement of purebred bloodlines. Unless you can improve the breed, you should not consider breeding your animal.<br><br>Acknowledgement: Miniature Pinschers by Evelyn Miller<br><br>I WANT TO BREED MY CHIHUAHUA!<br><br>OK-do you really? YouÂ’ve already heard all the arguments against breeding.  What I find is most folks turn a deaf ear to all this information-they donÂ’t think it applies to "their female". Alot of folks get visions of dollar signs in their heads-especially if a breed has recently become more popular than usual (ie. Taco Bell Chihuahua) DonÂ’t get me wrong-these are people who Love their dogs and would never do anything to hurt them but "boy! lookit how much theyÂ’re paying for Chihuahua puppies!" Sometimes the $ is hard to resist. That is why I thought I would explain ,as best I can, what goes into producing a litter-by a good breeder. Both monetary and otherwise.  When a good breeder decides to breed it is because they want to produce a "showable" animal -one that conforms to the standard-(hopefully-though IÂ’ve seen some breeders-good ones too- that breed to produce "whats popular" or "cute" . Too many "good breeders" are breeding excessive round heads,bulging eyes and smooshed muzzles and too many judges are awarding ribbons for them and too many people are buying them-theyÂ’re cute,they really are,they look sorta like Yoda in Star Wars. Nina is one- and yes,sheÂ’s adorable! She is also very ill most of the time. Because of her tiny muzzle her teeth and tongue donÂ’t fit properly in her mouth-the result was extreme tooth loss and a tongue that hangs out and alot of sinus/nose problems. Because of her big round head she has seizures that have to be controlled with expensive medication (though I am more hollistic these days) she also has congestive heart disease-she will not live as long as she could have or as comfortably. )  We will stick with the good breeder here-<br>They have paid a goodly sum for this female already-she is in prime health,excellent coat and very "sound" -that means all her parts work and are in the right places. Her "temperament" is excellent! That means shes; not a biter,not shy, not fearful -not whacko,etc. They want to produce the BEST PUPPIES they can to show and/or breed-they donÂ’t just want a "litter" of cute pups. OK-here begins the cost of breeding one litter.<br><br>Stud dog- most people think they can get their female serviced (bred- God help me I actually saw a breeder on the net that said his bitch had been "bread"- I pray it was a typo) for "pick of the litter". Most breeders already have enough of their own dogs ,wonÂ’t service yours unless she fits the standard and donÂ’t want ANY of the pups unless they're sure theyÂ’ll be exceptional-stud fees can range anywhere from $150-$1000.<br>You will have to have your bitch tested for any communicable diseases and have a vet verify it. $104. No one will breed their stud to your bitch without Â‘em and possibly chance losing the stud, the litter or a whole kennel!<br>She will have to have a pre-pregnancy exam and maybe hip xrays-$34-$158.   Now we get to mate her -right? Maybe,maybe not-Maybe she hates the male and wonÂ’t cooperate-mind you, we are not talking about throwing two dogs together in a room-they are ASSISTED in most cases. At the very least they are held afterwards to assure no injuries occur to either. They are not allowed to mate at will! Usually she is bred Once and then once more a day later. The bitch is then put on an optimal diet and watched closely-especially if its her first litter. She may or may not be pregnant-you wonÂ’t be able to tell for awhile-but you have to assume she is and feed her accordingly.<br>OK-say shes is - and does not loose the pups. Then its back to the vet for the last check up and possibly another xray to see the amount,placement and size of the pups-$34-$158.<br>Delivery time! YouÂ’d better study-alot can go right alot can go terribly wrong. You better be prepared-what do you do at 3am if a pup gets "stuck",is sideways or if shes in pain and nothing is happening? Are you really ready for this? It can be bloody,smelly and frightening. Back yard breeders donÂ’t care if they loose puppies or the mother- theyÂ’ll just get more-good breeders do care and care deeply. Are you ready to sit up all night or two watching her deliver? My record to date is 3 days with no sleep-1 day spent with Mom delivering 2 more watching and feeding the pups EVERY TWO HOURS because her milk did not come down. This sounds like fun? its not -some pups are too weak to nurse and require tube feedings (very difficult and risky), alot of care has to be taken to make sure they donÂ’t inhale formula,etc-it ainÂ’t fun kids-its grunt work.<br><br>What if she needs a cesarean? $258-$400. Cesareans are no fun either-its major surgery-sometimes you can loose the mother and/or the pups under anesthesia and if the vet uses the wrong kind or over uses anesthesia the pups tiny systems will be so depressed that they will die anyway. We are talking about 1 Â½ -3oz puppies here-to get an idea of what that is take an apple and put it on a diet scale till you find one that weighs 2oz-feel how light that is? Thats the size of that pup-do you think you can deal with caring for something that tiny? OK-it was an easy litter and there were no complications-but what if its not or the next one isnÂ’t?<br>After delivery vet check of pups and dam-$58.+(we are checking here for infections or problems with Mama or abnormalities in pups ie. cleft palate)<br>Litter care- they canÂ’t maintain their own body heat. More pups are lost to chilling or overheating than you may realize-you will need a heating pad, a whelping nest ,a heat source and you will have to know how to use it properly-$20-$269.<br>You will need a scale-if you canÂ’t tell if theyÂ’re gaining weight daily(and you canÂ’t tell by looking) you may loose them-$29.-$45.<br>OK-youÂ’ve watched them carefully for the first 3 weeks and weighed them daily-youÂ’ve supplemented the weaker ones(if any) with formula $5-$16. add another $10. for tiny baby bottles and a tiny bottle brush!<br>Now theyÂ’re 6 weeks and starting to wean-(yes-I said six weeks-anyone that sells you a pup at 6weeks of age is doing you, the pup and the dam a great disservice! ) go get them or make them special puppy food and spend all day cleaning it off them not to mention all the poop that Mama no longer handles!$10-$30<br>One pup not thriving well? Go get some high calorie supplement-$12. Remember you have to have these things on hand-you just canÂ’t find Â‘em at 2am!<br>Oh wait-theyÂ’re six weeks! First shots are due! $38.-$52 PER PUPPY! Thats $152-$208. for a litter of four and this HAS to be repeated 3 more times! This is the MAIN reason why bad breeders sell puppies too young-5-6 or even 8 weeks-they then donÂ’t have to put out the $ to immunize the pups-you do. Of course in the meantime they may have already gotten parvo or distemper-a good breeder doesnÂ’t want this because it puts all the dogs in danger and they donÂ’t want to loose a pup-it may be their next champion but they canÂ’t tell that yet so ALL the pups will get the BEST treatment and shots.<br>Worming; Mama has already been checked for worms-remember the pre-exam? but just to be on the safe side-because parasites of any kind can drain a puppyÂ’s system-they are wormed anyway. $16.-$24.<br>Cleanliness-newspaper is replaced often $2-$3 daily, the pen is disinfected $10, the puppies are clean-shampoo $5-$10<br>So weÂ’ve gone the whole route-assuming this was an easy litter,who is now 12 weeks, with no complications,emergencies(I once had a dam that got so excited during delivery that she held one of the pups down with her foot on its ear while she tried to "cut the cord" and in doing so she accidentally tore off the tip of its ear! $78. for the vet to fix it!) or loss of pups or dam and the litter has been registered with AKC($18.-thats how you get the blue applications for each pup!)<br><br>Now try selling them! Have fun! You've gotten really attached to these guys now,you love them-they even have nicknames!You put an ad in the paper and the first day you get 17 calls! Great right? Not necessarily. Of the 17,2 will be sincere ,nice people looking for a pet,10 will be bad breeders looking for another dog to cage and impregnate(you won't know this 'cause they won't tell you-you have to investigate)and 5 will be total lunatics! I got a call once from a person that was making a "dog porno" flick and wanted to use my stud and I don't place ads!<br>TOTAL-You ad it up -I get over $800.! Thats not counting stud fees if any or a cesarean if needed. The average cost for a pet quality pup is $250-$300.-if you have an average litter(2-4)from your one pet female and sell all- you may break even but I doubt it. Large kennels can make a profit because they are breeding several different females but kennels also have license fees,overhead,employees etc.<br>Of course you can skip all of the above-Bad Breeders do-dogs are a comodity to them-if one drops they replace it with another. Good breeders really care and you will benefit from the fact that they are trying to produce a "really great pup" because they treat all of them the same! Its sometimes alot cheaper and less heartbreaking to just "buy" another puppy than to try to produce one and possibly loose your beloved pet in the bargain. Think about it.<br><br>WHERE DO YOU FIND GOOD BREEDERS? DOG SHOWS-look in the newspapers pet ads for announcements of "Matches" these are shows without "points" or contact local breed clubs for "show" dates-they don't advertise alot so you'll have to really hunt -talk to breeders there(after they are done showing-before that they are too busy)some will talk some are too wound up in themselves to bother(you don't want to talk to them anyway!)<br><br>ASK AROUND- if you see someone with a Chi you like ask where they got it.<br><br>ON THE NET-so far the only decent listing I saw was on the "CHIHUAHUA KINGDOM" which is now gone.<br><br>You will rarely find good breeders in the newspaper-they don't want all those goofy calls and they are very picky about where their "kids" go. You be picky too-there are lots of bad breeders masquerading as good ones with all the trappings-also be aware that new registration services are popping up-if it doesn't say AKC-personally,I wouldn't mess with it-some of these new services only requirements for registration are that someone swear the parents are pure bred and they are registering "labradooles"(labrador/poodle mixes) aw com'on!<br>One more thing-I often hear "good breeders" say "my puppies never end up abandoned or in shelters!" -stop kidding yourselves-I and many,many others rescue them all the time!

ANY careless or not careful mistakes will or would likely result in the dog's death! is it worth it in the end?<br><br>further more, dogs' dun give birth to just one puppy, they give birth to several, and can you imagine such a small dog must bear the pain and torture to give birth to 4-5 puppies??? can u make sure that everyone who wants to breed their dogs will bring them to the vet when their dogs are going to give birth? can u make sure that they are so willing to spend all these money on these dogs???<br><br>If you can make sure that ur dog is going for as many checkups at the vet as like a woman is pregnant and going for regular checkups, that is fine abt breeding then! but how many owners will do such a thing? every visit to the vet will cost a few hundreds, and just to breed the dog, u need to spend a few hundreds to thousand!!!~<br><br>i believe most owners will just leave the poor dog there to struggle with the WHOLE process of labour! how selfish can u get!!!!!!!!!<br><br>Imagine you are pregnant COS PPL FORCE YOU TO BE and when u are giving birth, they refused to send you to the vet but to let you struggle to give birth ALL BY YOURSELF!~ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>
