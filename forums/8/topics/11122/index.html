            <div class='col-md body'><br>God in my perspective<br><br>Chch i'm not a godly person and i'm not here to rebuke your truth of god. I didn't have so much patients to run through all the forum content.<br><br>If i'm in a non christain point of view, all religion have their own sets of teaching and each their own claim of being the true faith. let's talk about the main stream religions, so can Christains say They are the one, buddha never said what he's god, then why worship someone when he said already, I seek a path to nirvana, ANY one could reach that state if they follow his path. Jews still refused to believe that they got kick out of Godliness collage. what about the new testament, Book of Matthew, mark, john, luke, can't it be that these people are historian?? Did they withness the acts of god? or was that the inspiration they received that compiled the bible. List of religions goes on &amp; on. Prove &amp; evidence you might say, but every one has got some kind of prove of the greatness and existence<br>My point is religion when not fully understood can be one great Fuc*kin circus, at the end, they can form GODS INC.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>MY 2cent worth analysis,<br>If you think your came from a long history of butt scatching family roots, good for you your a primate. You came from a proud lifeline, your grandpa(many Y2ks ago, got bored living up in the tree and decided to have a shave and acccidentally founded Gillette' and appointed charles darwin as your official spokes person  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Any other would have to fall under some sort of religion influence. cos you must have believe in GOD in some point of your life. What ever your religion is, as long as it teaches good and teaches both moral &amp; is socially acceptable, it's goods<br>MOst inportant has to be FAITH, Faith is what drive religion. You can go to worship everyday but, if you come out feeling like a empty shell. Ask yourself if your god forsake you or did you??<br><br>We are not in an era to judge, or be critical towards other faith.<br>So chch, if your reading this please give me your views, afterall i'm not saying i'm right but i think your cell-group leader has to be wrong towards the slow down the group part. Tell him i said so and GOD agree with me.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Mishima,<br><br>I dunno what I can offer to u. I'm basically an average guy out here. I'm very practical and down to earth. Most things I believe must have some grounds in it, if not, there must at least some intuition for my belief.<br><br>Then how can someone who's characters that qualifies him to become an atheist to ironically believe in God? It came no suprise if u listen on.<br><br>I was brought up in a Christian kindergarten.<br>Even though I'm not a christian at that time, I did everything pretty much like a Christian does. I remembered praying a lot, singing a lot more and saying grace before every meal. I was told a lot of stories which I thought were merely fairy tales. Later things start to fall into places when i got hold of a bible during my sec sch times. Those stories<br>are from the Bible! 'duh' u may say... but how was i to know as a 6 yr old kid then!?  The more I read the Bible, the more I recollect those stories I heard during kindergarten time.<br><br>As I grow older, I felt a tug in my heart, that told me I shall go to church. I dun have anyone whom I felt comfortable going church with. At that time, I thought this person would probably be my girlfriend. Then I imagined how perfect it would be to be have the company of my dear one down to church.<br><br>I meet this sweetest girl in my life. I took a liking for her and soon realised that this feeling is mutual. We hit it off very well, and I felt I've known her for a long time. The times we spend together are most memorable.<br><br>Although her parents are non-christian, she attended a church. Every time she does that, she has to secretly do it, for her father, esp, has violent objection to that.<br><br>She never mentioned about going down to church with her. She's least bothered by it. Then I thought, I've found the woman who I truly love, and she's willing to accepts the person I am.<br><br>I made known to her that I wish to go down church with her. Not for her, but because I truly wants to. Because she can't attend church whenever her father is around, she has to wait for the time when he's not. So she has not much chance to go to church.<br><br>I remembered clearly, once, she makes a call and invite me to go down church with her a few hours before the service.Just enuf time for me to prepare my trip down. Probably her father make some last minute decision to go out. I admire her faith, that's unwavered even when facing such objections.<br><br>There were times when things were bad between us. But the very next day, I wasn't feeling hurt anymore. We started talking again, and she told me she has prayed for me, and ask God take away the hurt feelings and forgive her.(dun ask what it is)For one thing, I am touched by her, but more importantly,I could really felt God working tangibly between us.<br><br>I think it's easier to feel God when u are in love. God is getting real.<br><br>I dunno how to write the second part, for it's an abrupt change, almost hard to believe.<br><br>I spend my quiet time with God. I ask whether this girl is the one in my life. Is she going to be my wife? No answer.<br><br>But somehow, almost illogically, the intuition came to me. She's leaving me. I couldn't believe and did not want to believe.<br>The feeling is stronger that I could not bear anymore. One day we were on the phone, and I asked her, "do u have anything that u wished to tell me but do not dare to". She told me what's on her mind.<br><br>Well, my intuition was right. She is leaving me. I guessed most people would have felt heart-broken when someone you love so dearly want to end a relationship. I couldn't believe myself, but I stayed so calm. We ended our conversation by praying for each other on the phone.<br><br>For many weeks I din felt any heartache over the loss of this relationship. I spend my time with God, this time asking why am I not feeling hurt by it. Progressively, I start to feel the pain in my heart. It was so bizarre, that when u break up with a girl, the pain comes a month later which is still strong enuf to make me cry. I thought, other than God who else is helping me to pull through all these?<br><br>I asked God whether she's the one for me. The answer is no. And God provide the comforting hands to let me accept the consequence of his will.<br><br>Although we ended our r/s, we are still good friends. I still love her, though it's not the kind of guy-girl love. It's the kind of love that a brother would have for a sister.<br><br>Mishima, I can talk a lot a lot about God, but I really can't finish the things that God has done. To me God is always loving. As to which religion God is in, it really doesn't matter. It is between you and God.<br><br>Slow down ur pace, calm yourself down take in a deep breath and u will learn to recognise what God has in stall for u.<br><br>Seek and you will find.<br><br>Regards,<br>chch<br><br>To all who are reading this, I have a prayer request to make. I'm at this stage of life where I'm quite confused of my direction. I dun like my cell group, neither do I like my church. But somehow I feel an affinity for the people. They are sincerly nice people, but I felt very pressurised and suffocating when I'm in cell or church. This has been bothering me for a very long time and I still have no answer for it.<br><br></div>

To affirm your faith in God? I think that you should follow your intuition. If your intuition says that you should leave your cell group and your church, then leave them. For all you know, God might have make plans for you and will show you to the right ones next time. God will not leave you ... think of the lost sheep... you're like one now... God will find you and bring you home...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>riesla:<br><br>this sort of things arh...depend on how u look at it. if it were for me, i wun usually think that people are that scheming. Probably it's carelessness on the part of the cell intern(still intern mah, so make mistake can be forgiveable).<br><br>I understand lar, cell leader(or interns) do not have much time going to ask everyone for their opinions. So maybe s/he make the decision beforehand and hope u will support it. Still there's room for discussion. I believe, nobody can be coerced into doing things without some "bad feelings" inside. Certainly u will do it grudgingly. And dun u think it's unfair for the new believer. Try talking to the cell intern, and sort things out.<br><br>Talking abt God's plan...God do have a plan for me. But it's the ultimate plan, it guaranteed. So whatever I plan for myself now, eventually, it will merged with what God has for me. God will never forced me to do anything, it's his gift of free-will. Thank God for that!<br><br>When facing difficulties in life, it always encourages me when I think of this...<br>I will probably live an earthly life of abt 75 yr. But after it will be eternity in the spiritual realm. So when I compare my life now with eternity, 75 yr seems nothing. Hope everyone can think this way and surely ur day will be a brighter one!<br><br>[This message has been edited by chch (edited 12 February 2001).]</div>
