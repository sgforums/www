I have highlighted some of your mistakes above, which given that you have spoken english all your life, should not have been made.<br><br>Secondly, you mentioned that you have "seperated" all ties with him, but later on you admit to still hanging on to faint hopes because you still like him. Trying to contradict yourself?<br><br>Thirdly, you like him mainly because you find him to be the tall, dark, handsome, well built, generally good looking guy. Shallow? On this count I think he would probably be better off not having you by his side.<br><br>Lastly, I did not want to attack you neither do I like doing so. I believe the others do not too.
