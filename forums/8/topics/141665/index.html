            <div class='col-md body'>i still cannot get over how bad his english is. to be honest, i ever had a slight teeny weeny interest over this male friend of mine but because he has become 'bad' and influenced by the overwhelming numbers hokien speaking gangsters in my school, i have separated all ties with him. on countless occasions, he communicated with me using explicit and rude hokien language and this is something i cannot stand. i believe his secondary school is also filled with such people around but he tried to put in effort to 'please' me by not using so much of that dreaded thing initially but now he's beyond hopeless. let u judge for yourselves, this is his msn nickname.<br><br>|| *insert chinese name here* some chinese words that i suppose are song lyrics.. - aiya test comin bo tak chek, jia lat arhz!!! revisioning now.<br><br>look at that, where is the proper grammar? some ppl just need a knock on their heads to wake them up from thier delusional world in which only 'hokien speaking hooligans' live in.<br><br>because of that, i have lost a friend and i dont wish to lose more friends. im deeply saddened by the fact that im the minority in my jc as i couldnt disagree its a cheena jc. if only he didnt act like that, i might have chosen him as my bf or who knows, even future-husband. its such a pity he actually has the looks but he chose to ruin himself by the foolish acts. i think i might as well quit.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>its my personal opinion that hokien is a crude language that is ungentle and provoking in many ways but im certain that there are some ppl out there that agrees with me. our school's gp class has even came out with a fine system to fine ppl who speak hokien or chinese during gp lessons but those ignorant hooligans disregard it and refused to pay when they were asked to. why invite unneccessary trouble? they can speak hokien for all i care when they are locked up in jail after being arrested or sitting in a public toilet cubicle, just make sure i do not hear it. i got enough of it, i hear it every single day and its bothering me. when will these ppl grow up?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think you need to come to terms with something:<br><br>1. Hokkien is the most common chinese dialect in Singapore<br><br>2. Singlish (which basically is a mixture of english, chinese, dialects, malay...whatever), is perfectly acceptable in an informal social situation.<br><br>3. The common dialects spoken in the work force (depending on the industry you're in) is usually either Hokkien or Cantonese.<br><br>4. As long as a person is not using Hokkien or any other language to curse and swear at you, it's perfectly fine and acceptable.<br><br></div>
