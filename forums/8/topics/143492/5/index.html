If xiaxue dared to post entries online that she knew would offend many people then she must accept the possibility that sooner or later the above event may happen..<br><br>Yes, theres nothing wrong with being frank, controversial etc.. however what about racists comments, insults, personal attacks? If being frank is a viable excuse then I could just insult or post racists comments about anyone i dislike and when questioned will reply" Oh don't limit my freedom of speech..."<br><br>Yes, if you don't like it, you can dont read it. But think about this, xiaxue is different. Whether you like it or not she has influence. Sooner or later her blog entries will reach parties who may be offended indirectly..<br><br>If you have power, it comes with great responsibility... if you dare to post something controversial then dare to face up to the possibility to angry retaliations.. this is an imperfect world but thats how it is<br><br>But then again the loss of 3000 mails and 2 years of blogging is horrible... there will be bad karma for the hacker</div></blockquote>Wow, couldn't have phrased it better myself.

It only creates more hate and more reason for people on both sides to kill innocents.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

And I've just gotten back from London, where majority of the places hit are very close to my home there, so excuse me if I don't feel quite charitable about such cowardy actions. i've been very anti-war about the iraq war and i still am, but i condemn the bombers as well.</div>
