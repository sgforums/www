I don't really like what she writes, and I feel that most of her postings are nothing much more than glorified attempts at at attracting attention to herself. I just read one of her articles and totally swore off the site for good.<br><br>Still, if you don't like her site, then don't read it. If you don't like the attention she's getting, then don't give her your attention. If you don't like a person, tell it to him/her straight in the face.<br><br>Hacking into someone's blog and e-mail account and then deleting everything is a hit below the belt. At the very least, that's really disgraceful. At the very worst, it's pure computer malice which can result in jail time (if I'm not wrong).<br><br>To hack into and destroy someone's blog - that's really low.
