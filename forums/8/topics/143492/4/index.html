And talking first before thinking is always what gossipers and rumour mongers are very prone to do. There are people who hold themselves back so as not to say the wrong thing and to avoid hurting anyone.<br><br>At the same time there are people who shoot their mouths off without care or consideration of others. Not only do they get away with it, Xiaxue manages to make a career out of it. Personally, I think that sucks.<br><br>You can see it as this, that someone has made a statement against the person and the blog entity that is Xiaxue. A non-verbal statement that is.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Like what some of the people has mentioned here.. what goes around, comes around, that hacker will get his just deserts and what he did was wrong no matter his justification...<br><br>But on the other hand, have you ever wondered why xiaxue became a victim? I believe that some of the misfortunes that befall us can be avoided. If xiaxue dared to post entries online that she knew would offend many people then she must accept the possibility that sooner or later the above event may happen..<br><br>Yes, theres nothing wrong with being frank, controversial etc.. however what about racists comments, insults, personal attacks? If being frank is a viable excuse then I could just insult or post racists comments about anyone i dislike and when questioned will reply" Oh don't limit my freedom of speech..."<br><br>Yes, if you don't like it, you can dont read it. But think about this, xiaxue is different. Whether you like it or not she has influence. Sooner or later her blog entries will reach parties who may be offended indirectly..<br><br>If you have power, it comes with great responsibility... if you dare to post something controversial then dare to face up to the possibility to angry retaliations.. this is an imperfect world but thats how it is<br><br>But then again the loss of 3000 mails and 2 years of blogging is horrible... there will be bad karma for the hacker</div>

Start an anti-xiaxue blog. cannot out-talk her? then blame him/herself for being so talentless with words. hacking? cowardy. not that im a fan of hers, u understand. But no matter what, I think hacking her blog is crossing the line. im just sick of seeing people who cannot get even fairly resort to underhanded means. how low does one have to stoop to get even? Even with her being as offensive as most people say she is, how come I don't feel an urge to go hack her site? Make no qualms about it, the hacker him/herself is also a petty little snivel, who doesn't even have the balls to stand out and attack her head-on. Nooo... instead, little gutless dipwad has to hide somewhere and namelessly launch their pathetic little attacks. Sounds just like those cowardy terrorists we see. *pui*<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
