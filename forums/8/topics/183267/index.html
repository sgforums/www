            <div class='col-md body'>This person sent a mass email to students in NTU.<br>No one has yet to bravely and openly made demands to the school, except his guy.<br><br>Read the following email to understand:<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------<br>This is an updated edition of my email. I would like to highlight few points to you before you read this.<br><br>1st protest is always the last solution. I am not suggesting that we at the first place jump into protest. We want to achieve a win-win situation as well.<br><br>2nd We would also like to address other issue than just purely about the language our instructor speak. Other issues might be the<br><br>Tuition fees hike and hostel fees hike.<br><br>A union that is not only knows how to give us ice cream and goodies bag.<br><br>Student asking for 7-11 and such 24 hours convenient stall.<br><br>We hope that there are more places during special semester.<br><br>Dear student,<br><br>Do you have some issue that never been solve no matter how many time you bring it up to the union or our administrative officers?<br><br>The purpose of this email is to looking for committee members and other interested party to form an informal committee to deal with the school regarding all issues that students think is important to solve. Please delete this email if you are here just to study. I am looking for people who want to improve the university system. I am looking for those with courage and willing to spent time to do something extremely meaningful. I need real man and ladies who have great leadership. There is no certificate given to committee members and also no pay for you. This is an event after the exam. (Hence it wouldn't affect your study.)<br><br>We might be organizing large scale protest (will then look into the law part to make sure it is not illegal) to gain awareness. Delete it if you only care your own business.<br><br>Disclaimer: This in not an email initiates an agenda to overthrow the student union or any other illegal action.<br><br>Dear students,<br><br>Now we shall proceed with the email.<br><br>Yes we have been passive for many years; we are brought up in this kind of environment. Yes, our school is doing quite well in the world. We are rank 48. I hope you are very happy with it.<br><br>Yet, there is some question to think about.<br><br>First, it is about the fee hike.<br><br>Quoted:<br><br>Look at the d*** building the school is building for SADM... looks like a mini esplanade.. that's where all our fee hike is going.. to serve that tiny miniscule population of SADM students in their too-pretty-to-study-in building.<br><br>Well, I do not pay the tuition fee. But, I gave my sympathy to all students who have to pay more years after years. I am committed to request for a lock in scheme if there is no way to reverse the fee hike. I will need your support to make sure this is done before the next fee revision. We would request that the union be involved in revising the fee and hopefully university budget.<br><br>We have been asking for course instructor that can speak English that we can understand!<br><br>Engineering students have been going to lab week after week to guess what those PhD student and master student try to say. My question is if they cannot speak something we can understand, why let them teach? Let them do their research. So as those professors that cannot speak something we can understand (non proper is ok) but at least we want him/her to speak something that we can understand.<br><br>Are we asking too much from the school? Hey we are the customer of the university. I am a scholar (I am not trying to show u how good I am as a scholar), I don't pay the tuition fees, But think about those who pay their tuition fees, when tuition fees is raising, yet year after year, the lecturer (who cant speak proper English) that we keep complaining is still teaching, how you feel? what is the reason behind it?<br><br>What if my lecturer is a noble prize winner who something that I cannot understand, do I learn from him?<br><br>I am committed to have the university to give their statement that there will be no more PhD and Master student who cannot speak to teach in Lab or tutorial. I would work toward their agreement so that they  will not to taking in new teaching staff that have communication difficulties.<br><br>We want more places in special semester.<br><br>Students have raised their concern regarding getting subject in special semester is like buying 4D. We want to make sure that most students can have some subject if not all. We would request for a add drop period.<br><br>What if I can get goodies bags, free ice creams, free T-shirt, free this free that, yet the union have no power over important issues.<br><br>I am committed to speak to union representative and ask them to do more things then their welfare fest. What if I got more free ice cream, or McDonalds, or roti boy? We want the union fight to improve the university system, not increase the number of goodies bag we have.<br><br>And more and more issue are to be discuss...<br><br>I am proposing to have a group of student with great leadership to come together to form a informal committee to deal with the school.<br><br>Time and money are expected to be spent. Nothing can be claim back. We do not have grant here. It might be the 1st time in history of NTU that student can deal with school in a serious and legal way. This is not a student body. I have no intention of register any student body. I just would want top raise awareness of university student about what they can do.<br><br>We are dealing with your problem. Think about it, are you satisfied with the university system? There should be a man(it could be a woman as well, I am not discriminating female) to stand out to lead the students to claim a stake in the university. We want to be consult for important university decision.<br><br>Student, what are you waiting? Stand up and fight for your consumer rights or you will be given low quality education for your years here. Be confused in the lecture by not understanding the English your lecturer use or stand up and speak up, the choice is yours.<br><br>For more information, reply to this email or contact me at XXXXXXXX.<br><br>I know I do not use good English, please don't call me or reply to me and tell me this. That is why I need you here!<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Goh Soo Liang,Gary<br><br>2nd Year Student<br><br>(Design Specialisation)<br><br>Nanyang Technological University<br><br>School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering<br></div>
