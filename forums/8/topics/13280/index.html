I think it is up to the person to be responsible to his or her postings. If the motive is bad, so be it, there is nothing we can do about it. But I believe there are ppl who truly wants a proper discussion or help to be there. Even if there is a heated agrument, it is better than taking a knife or gun and going around and started killing ppl. I guess some ppl just wan to vent their anger, emotions here... through words.<br><br>As for those craps, I am really tired of it, i thot they are worst. We can see from the thread, from one good topic, it can jump into a really off topic, non-sense postings. It really waste the sgforums.com effort to come up with a forum that everybody in singapore can really discuss something that is good, bad or anything. It really waste ppl time to post their questions and when they login and see 20 reply, but of those, onli a few is related to the topic and others are just non-sense craps.<br><br>Of course it is really difficult to restrict postings, but it is just a thot.<br><br>------------------<br>He who knows others is wise;<br>He who know himself is enlightened.</div>
