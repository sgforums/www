            <div class='col-md body'>Heh heh, my turn......I discovered that:<br><br>- There is usually no such thing as fully unconditional love.  There is always a limit to which someone would love you, or to which you would love someone.<br><br>- That people are easier to brainwash than I thought, even logical, educated people.  All you need are marketing experts to lead the way.<br><br>- That there is no point getting all flustered up, or losing my temper over things which I cannot control.  No point going against the system.  I used to be a very hot tempered person in my younger days.<br><br>- That there is no such thing as totally great.  There are always weaknesses in everyone, every system, everything.<br><br>- That there is no such thing as complete fairness in anything.<br><br>- That life is not always about status, money, etc.  Its about stability, happiness as defined by oneself and mental peace.<br><br>- That the male libido degrades with age. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>- That there are always exceptions.<br><br>- That we cannot always believe what we read, especially on internet forums.  So better not believe what I wrote too much.  hahahahha.....<br><br></div>
