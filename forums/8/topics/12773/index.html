            <div class='col-md body'>My sister's bf's friend's brother (relationship a little distance lah) just committed sucide becos his gf left him. We normally hear such things about gals committing sucide becos their bfs leave them..but not normally the other way round. Guys are usually thought to be the stronger one when it comes to break ups. But are all the brave and strong front just a show the put in front of others?<br>I remember the last time my brother was hospitalised, the guy sleeping next to his bed had just committed sucide too. He drank half a bottle of detergent and after having pumped his stomach, and having awaken up, he immediately called his gf and asked if she coming to see him, asking her not to leave him anymore.<br>Are guys also weak emotional?<br>Any comments?</div>

I guess it is hard..<br>You can refer the the column in 'Life' written by a 'MCP', women call him that. He is called Xie wen i tink. His articles reflect the views of most men i suppose. We are not MCPs but find it hard to express feelings and to pass these feelings onto the women.<br><br>This is where communication breakdown? I don't really noe how to solve the problem.. haha, maybe girls can start teaching guys how to express their feelings.. sheesh..<br><br>But seriously, it is hard to chnge the inherent wiring from evolution but i tink it is possible??!!<br><br>Just need a little more time. Or maybe can bombard the guys questions to find out wat he really want.. or maybe funny little questionaires fer the guys to fill up so their gf/wife noe.. It is hard for guys to say it out directly?<br><br>Like if a guy is scared or something, most likely he will share it with his buddies at work and so on. When he returns home, he would expect his wife/gf to give him a break, give him support. Byt becos the gf/wife doesn't noe, may start nagging..<br><br>This goes on fer a long time, so the guy would rather stay away from home or become cold to gf/wife..<br><br>So instead of being critical all the time, why not try being a little more caqring and listen first.<br><br>------------------<br><strong>I consider myself an Expert tomato gardener since all of my friends tell me I have the most colourful and sweetest tomatoes.<br><br>"Life is too short to bother with tasteless tomatoes."<br></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Haha...I guess guys can't escape from the 'title' of being 'unable to express their feelings properly' while women can't escape from the 'title' of being a nag.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>I guess women (not all, some are not naggy ok) need to kick that bad habit.

He was just a roommate of my brother when my brother was hospitalised.<br>Some times I really think that people who drink detergent or cut their wrist dun really have the ultimate, extreme thinking of wanting to end their lives. They just putting an act to get their partners back. I mean, if you really wanna die, why choose a way which is so difficult to die and so easy to be saved by someone.

            <div class='col-md body'>might not bi juz bcoz of break up loh, i think. he might hav many other problems on hand, such as work, financial, family problems etc.<br><br>not 100% sure, but i alwez think dat guys have a greater responsibility than gers. despite all de talk bout girls &amp; guys equal, but in de end, i dun think gers realli understand de stress dat guys face, we take it upon ourselves dat we are de ones who have to bring de bread home, perform at work/school etc (i mean feel, not as a result of necessity). Failing to do so realli does bring extreme stress (we stress ourselves, i mean).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>suicide is just a form of illusionary escape...<br>just committing suicide over the loss of a relationship may be due to a problem of immaturity perhaps?<br><br>oh yeah, i read the article by Xie Wen too, and i kinda find it very meaningful, especially here in Singapore where the girls are becoming increasingly demanding... and the guys are often left misunderstood and looked-down upon.<br></div>
