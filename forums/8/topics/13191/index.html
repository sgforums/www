Singaporeans normally does not have that much of consideration for the others loe...in that aspect..i think..we do lose to the caucasians..but for kiasu..who is not?? i mean..look everywhere...kiasu exist everywhere in the world..the most prominant example..Bill Gates...why does he want to make sure that he has the monopoly of OS's in thwe world..simplay because he does not want to lose to his counterparts in the OS competition..i mean..it may not be the best example..but just hopes it helps.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok let me speak of my exp. I have been in canada for over a yr and i realise something. "kiasu" is over-rated. It even exist here in Canada (supposedly a white country). Take for example on boxing day (a day where everything is on sale). On that particular day, we drove past a electronic shop way early in the morning (at 3am) and there was already a long queue of people lining up! And we actually got off and asked what time the first person was there.. 11.30pm the day before!!! Talk about kiasu!!<br>Regarding the mrt thingy, its is the same here...everyone wants to rush in so they wont have to wait for another train. Its the same anyway.. and i think someone did said that Singaporean has no culture.. i seriously recommend him to study moral education. We have a very diverse culture that that only a few countries in this world shares.<br>So think about it.</div>
