            <div class='col-md body'>Something happened today that made me think of this question.<br>I have a problem which has been dragged for many months and there are two frens whom I would turn to for listening ears or advise, one of whom is my best fren.<br>However, as time goes by, it seems that they are getting a bit xian and sick of my problem, it feels like there might be times when they are avoiding me so as to spare themselves the bother.<br>Today, I called both of them as I needed someone to talk to. Both told me they are busy and will call me back later. I waited for several hours before calling them again and got the same response. I waited all the way till nite and still no response from them so far. Thus, it leads me to think of such a question.<br>If they are such important or close frens, is it alright for them to behave this way? And if they have behaved so, is it justifiable for me to judge them as my frens on the scale?<br>I guess this is not curiosity, but foolish thoughts.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hymen, I understand your predicament perfectly. I myself have 2 best frens too. However it's the holidays now and we don't even go out together. 1 of them is grounded while the other would rather spend time with her other frens. Anyway the main point is that I used to share my problems with them alot. But lately, neither of them seems to be around. And even when they are, they juz seem unwilling to listen to me. I'm kinda disappointed coz whenever they have their problems, I would try my best to help them. I make it a point to call them at least once every 2 days to ask about them, and I sms them. But they dun even bother to reply or anything. A true friendship involves effort from both parties. I put in my effort, and I'm waiting for them to put in theirs. If they don't, well, I guess they juz don't want this friendship anymore. Kinda sad :~<br><br>[This message has been edited by honggggg (edited 23 December 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey,Thanx for your encouragements, Shogun, Ding and FireIce.<br><br>FireIce : I always feel I could turn to you for some directions. Is it true?<br><br>honggggg : Actually, in every relationship, not only BGR or friendsghips, it takes both parties to put in the effort for things to work. But due to the fact that these relationships matter differently to different ppl, they tend to put in different amount of effort, and also, when things happen, they are affected differently. We can't expect everyone or that other party to put in as much as we do, doesn't this make us very helpless?<br><br>Larry : Your 2nd option hor, isn't it like asking me to judge my frens again?<br><br>There's a change in how things are progressing now, seems like one of my two mentioned frens, my best fren, is facing the same problem as me, as in the problem that I always complain about.Hmm.......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hymen,in wat position are we in to judge our frens?  They are not obligated to listen to our problems all the time, and besides, have u been doing the same?  as in, when they have their own problems, were u there to lend a listening ear?  sometimes, by human nature, we tend to be selfish and expect ppl to be there when we need them, but we have to understand that our frens have their own lives to lead as well, they are not living for us, to be our 24 hour counsellor.<br><br>If u always demand your frens to listen to your every problems, whether big or small, it makes u sound very whiney...as in u complain abt everything, and when a BIG problem really comes along, ur frens are already so tired out by your constant whining that they just wanna take a break from u...so, problems dat are tiny, bear it urself...then ur frens wont be sian of u.<br><br>u cant judge if ur frens are worthy or not, unless u r a 100% good fren urself.  I thk there are more 'criteria' to a good fren, other than willingness to listen to ur problems.  Give ur frens a break, maybe they really have a good reason for ignoring u...if they are really sian of u, then just move on, no point judging if they are good frens or not... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, what i meant by judging frens, I was just asking how you would judge your fren and are you really able to do it?<br><br>I asked the question, not in doubt of our ability to do it, but more like wanting to know how you guys might do it.<br><br>Dunno lah.....seems not so significant now. Had a few days of rest and thought about many things. Sometimes, it seems like everyone is being judged all the time. Maybe it's linked to the thread abt Stereotyping.<br><br>Personally, I do try to be as attentive as I can to my frens. When I see a fren is down, even if I'm really tired, I'll still walk over and offer anything. For him or her to open up or cry on. I dun expect all my frens to do the same but I guess there are times you just need something like that, even if it's just a little attention from them.<br><br>Do you guys rank your frens?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Same old problem today.....<br><br>Why my this fren never do this?<br><br>So, I called one of my fren, which I mentioned above. We talked a bit and he showed some impatience, saying he dunno lah....up to me lah....and so on.....<br><br>I know he's sick of this long-running problem of mine. But if he's gonna become like any other frens which I can't really talk to, then I'm one friend short to turn to.<br><br>FireIce would probably tell me that the problem is mine and I have to settle it myself. But I'm very reliant on others for opinion, for advise.....maybe I'm being a coward, cos if anything goes wrong, I won't have to blame myself. But yeah, this is how it goes.</div>
