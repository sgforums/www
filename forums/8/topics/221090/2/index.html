Has anyone tried this? because i scared later he bua song and give me gangster look.<br><br>I've phrased it very politely already, and am gonna try it next time. because i scared if i say that, later everyone will think i'm a pervert and only want girls to cut my hair. i'm not a pervert, though. even if it's a transsexual who's cutting my hair and he/she gives me the right hairstyle i want, i also don't mind. in fact, i'll also worship him. and even if it's Chiling Lin who cuts my hair and she gives me freak hairstyle, then i also will hate her.
