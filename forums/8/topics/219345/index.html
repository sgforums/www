            <div class='col-md body'>the reason why people do this is because they want more people to see the things they are selling.<br><br>by associating whatever they are selling with popular names, the items they are selling will pop up more often when people key in the search.<br><br>for example i'm selling a pen, i put the title as<br><br>pen (not naruto, tanformers)<br><br>so whenever a person search for naruto or tranformers, the pen i'm selling will pops up although it is not what i wanted to search for.</div>

Why? you want to buy, a mountain bike for example. Yahoo has 255 entries while ebay only has lets say, 100. As a buyer, which auction company would you go to, of course the one who has more stuffs to sell.<br>And ebay's interfrace sux too. poor representation of photos.</div>
