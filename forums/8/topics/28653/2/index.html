            <div class='col-md body'>How's it going, y'all?<br><br>Just read this article that I thought was a great way to put down the overrated feminist movement, and how women today have taken it over the edge.<br><br>It's a good read, may be a wee bit long, but it's most insightful, so enjoy...<br><br>Bring it on!!<br>-------------------------------------------<br>Over the past century, the women's movement has made considerable advancements with women's rights. They have come a long way in claiming equal treatment that has been denied them for many years.<br><br>Unfortunately, the battle has gone past equality and has degenerated into a male bashing game. This article is not trying to reduce the importance of the women's movement, nor is it attempting to demean the women who sacrificed many things to attain their rights.<br><br><strong>Men are fading</strong><br><br>I'm simply bringing to light the fact that there are a lot of discriminations committed against men too, ranging from parenthood and employment to spousal abuse. The only difference is that men are being told to keep their mouths shut and swallow the abuse in order to make up for the injustices committed against women by our male ancestors.<br><br>It's time for change; men are slowly waking up and realizing that if it's fair treatment women want, they're going to have to stop the prejudice against men too. I want to be treated as an individual, not a member of the canine family due to the genitals attached between my legs. I'm not going to complain any further, I'll keep my mouth shut, but at least give me the chance to share a day in the life of a beast, a.k.a. a man - one of our readers.<br><br><strong>Wake up call</strong><br><br>7:00 am: I'm rudely interrupted from the sanctuary of my peaceful dream, and quickly brought back to the reality of the feminist media-run world by my radio alarm clock. A news bulletin reports that women's hopes of a real life are squashed in Iraq due to the UN Sanctions.<br><br>Now I really feel for the women's suffering, but years of sanctions on Iraq have devastated the entire society, including men. So why is there no mention of men's suffering or their forced recruitment into suicidal military services?<br><br>7:10 am: The reality of getting ready to commute to a dead-end job that depresses, demoralizes and exhausts my body sets in. But I quickly forget how much I hate my job when I look at the picture of my son Billy and realize that it is all worth it.<br><br>7:15 am: On the front page of the newspaper, I read an article stating that, "Women don't get promoted to the positions they deserve." Hey, welcome to the club.<br><br>7:30 am: I pick up the latest issue of GQ magazine, and while sifting through the pages, I'm reminded of how important the male penis size is to women, as an Absolut Vodka advertisement features three naked men hiding their penis with three different sized bottles, and a caption that reads, "Size Matters -- Now available in three sizes."<br><br>Wow, thankfully I'm average-sized and confident enough not to let this propaganda bother me, but I really wonder how this advertisement will psychologically affect all those men who are below average?<br><br>I could already imagine what the women's movement would have said if the ad with the same caption featured three women covering their breasts.<br><br>7:50 am: I put on my usual navy blue suit, and as I place a tie around my neck, all I can think of is flaccid penises. So I readjust my tie to hang a little lower than the belt. Maybe I'm being a little paranoid, but then again, "Size Matters."<br><br>8:00 am: As I wait for the bus in the shelter, a blue-collar worker neatly tears down a movie poster of Jennifer Love Hewitt. Curious, I ask her why.<br><br>The female worker states, with a little embarrassment, that the poster may be construed as sexist. So I ask her why not take down the other poster of Brendan Fraser starring his half naked body in George of The Jungle?<br><br>Her reply was well-justified with, "Oh my God, have you seen his chest and abdominal muscles?" Of course, I know better than to doubt a woman's carnal desire.<br><br>8:30 am: I arrive at work, only to hear the awful news that Jack, a fellow role-model/father-like supervisor was dismissed. He was accused of sexual harassment by one of the new female employees for putting his hand on her shoulder as he does with all the personnel, including myself.<br><br>8:45 am: It's a busy day so the boss asks me to fetch him a cup of coffee downstairs from the corner cafÃ©. I think to myself, if I were a woman, I could refuse to do it. But I'm not, so I don't have a reason to complain.<br><br>8:50 am: As I return with my boss' coffee, I notice two female employees gossiping by the water cooler. Incidentally, one of them happens to be the new employee who had Jack fired.<br><br>9:00 am: When I get back to my desk, the woman who works beside me puts on her radio. The loud music gives me a headache. She does it deliberately. Ever since she asked me out for dinner and I politely declined her offer, she has found subtle ways to annoy me.<br><br><strong>Blue noon</strong><br><br>12:00 pm: I decide to take a walk outside for my lunch break. As I walk across the street to buy a hotdog, I see a construction worker being tended to by paramedics after having fallen from the eighth floor.<br><br>12:30 pm: When I get back to the office, the two gossiping females are still by the water cooler. They're complaining that women get paid less than men. Out of fear, I look down to the floor and go about my own business.<br><br>As a pay clerk, I know that women don't earn less than men. Some women earn much more than many men. Most women earn about the same wages as men and if men earn more, it can usually be explained by their long hours or the difficulties and dangers of the job. Men do the hardest and most dangerous work in society.<br><br>2:00 pm: Jimmy the mail boy is suspended until further notice for sending a joke around the office via e-mail. The joke's title read, "Male Comebacks." Apparently, the joke was seen by a nosy female staff member who sniffed through her colleague's e-mail and was personally offended.<br><br>2:02 pm: I receive an e-mail from Shelly Newsanse -- the plant supervisor -- with the following joke title, "Men Are Like..."<br><br>2:05 pm: Jimmy's suspension is withdrawn. Instead, he gets a slap on the hand and his Internet rights revoked for one week.<br><br>3:00 pm: My supervisor calls me into his office to finally follow up on that promotion I've been working hard for. Unfortunately, he has bad news for me. Apparently, he could not give me the promotion, which according to company rules I fairly deserved ahead of anyone else according to my (1) seniority, (2) top 90% employee performance (set by Ms. Shelly Newsanse herself).<br><br>He's afraid that he might offend the female workers who already complained to Shelly that not enough women are being promoted to positions of power.<br><br>4:00 pm: A pamphlet from the human resource staff about equal treatment makes its way to my desk. A two-page memo summarizes that unfair employment practices will not be tolerated and that women should be equally treated. For some peculiar reason, it states almost twenty times that equal opportunity policies do not discriminate against men.<br><br>4:30 pm: I get news from Shelly that the new female gossiping employee who accused Jack of sexual harassment received the promotion that I was expecting. Apparently, the company was scared of a possible sexual harassment lawsuit.<br><br>4:50 pm: I overhear Amy from the Sales department complaining that men are no longer chivalrous nor do they know how to behave like gentlemen.<br><br><strong>End of day misery</strong><br><br>5:00 pm: It's time to go home, and remembering what Amy had said a few minutes earlier, I decide to open the door for a woman and her friend. As they walk by me, one of them commented, "What a pervert, he probably thinks he's going to get my number for opening the door for me."<br><br>5:15 pm: I get on the bus and there is only one seat left. There is a woman my own age that gets behind me and I very politely let her take the last seat. Then it hit me, was I being sexist? I'm not sure about that, but I do know that now I have to stand for an hour.<br><br>7:00 pm: Back at home, I see a paid public announcement on TV stating that men are to blame just as much as women for unwanted pregnancies and that they should take equal responsibility for raising the child. This brings tears to my eyes as I begin to miss the laughter of my son Billy. The court ruled that I did not have equal parenting rights and therefore have only limited time with my son.<br><br>7:05 pm: I call my ex-wife asking if I can speak to Billy. She instantly refuses, claiming that she gave birth to him and that I have no right to see him. Then she has the guts to say, "The $800 you sent me for the month ran out and I need more money for Billy. Why can't you be a responsible father and provide for your son?"<br><br>So I propose that this time, instead of sending another check, I could spend some quality time (as a father should) with my son shopping for clothing and school supplies. But her reply was, "Not on your life, send me the check, I'll buy what Billy needs."<br><br>I never knew a seven-year-old child needed $800 a month to pay for his Gucci shoes and Prada purse. I guess I'll have to send over another check, especially if I want to see my son again.<br><br>7:30 pm: My girlfriend comes home from school and heads straight to the bedroom. She likes to relax from studying hard -- she's going to be a doctor.<br><br>9:00 pm: I go to bed and my girlfriend is already asleep. I'm feeling a little lonely -- especially after not being able to speak to my son, so I put my arms around her, but she pushes me away. She claims that she's too tired for "that" and that men are only interested in "that."<br><br><strong>What women want</strong><br><br>11:00 pm: My girlfriend decides that she's excited and arouses me by stimulating my penis. Even though I am really tired and slightly upset, I do my duty. Because if I don't "bang" her, she's going to get it somewhere else -- according to Cosmo.<br><br>11:20 pm: My girlfriend starts to complain that I can't get it right. She begins to nag that it's not fast enough, hard enough, soft enough, or even slow enough. Then she starts to grumble that men cannot do more than one thing at a time without fumbling around.<br><br>11:25 pm: After this constant nagging, I give up trying to please her. She becomes very angry with me and goes back to sleep. At this point, I begin to wonder if I'm not just a vibrator with ears.<br><br>12:30 am: I feel a rib crack and a sudden loss of breath as I get an unexpected foreign elbow to the ribs and go flying out of bed. "You're an insensitive man," she claims.<br><br>12:31 am: Not being able to fall asleep from a bruised rib, I head to the couch and watch TV. The late-night news reports that a woman charged with murdering her husband was released on account of self-defense. Ironically following the report, a commercial break for Radox Bath Salts shows a female character pushing her old boyfriend over the railing of her apartment. He falls six floors.<br><br>Oh, how I long to be a baby boy again, somehow being a little puppy sounds better than being a dog. I've been made to feel like I'm some kind of evil animal, or worse, a beast.<br><br>Yet because I'm a man, I also have no voice to let women know about the level of our sorrows. It's time that a "malenists" group arose and began to speak out against male discrimination. Oh, but what am I saying, I forgot, women don't discriminate.<br><br><strong>A possible solution</strong><br><br>Let's not kid ourselves, there is discrimination against both genders. No matter how far women have come in their fight for equal rights, there will always be discrimination against them. In return, social control mechanisms will also ensure that men have their fair share of discrimination. So rather than sitting down and pointing the finger at one another, let's work together to eliminate it.<br><br>That's right, both women and men should work together. All women should fight and speak out against any act of discrimination against men. And men should follow suit and speak out against any unfair discrimination against women.<br><br>We have to learn to separate our gender differences and realize that we are all human, and that an act of discrimination against a gender is an act against an individual. We have to speak out together and let it be known that we -- men and women -- will not tolerate discrimination against any individual.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Before i start , i know that this is a sensitive topic. therefore i apologise to all women if the post below is deemed sexist and i will remove it voluntarily if needed.<br><br>it is very diu lian for the guys to actually ask the girl to pay as well.....i mean it's rather a socially accepted norm that guys shld always pay. I mean if anyone wants gender equality...fight for it. sometimes it's just that w/o putting in much effort 1 side wants to have equal rights to things. women want equal rights to jobs,promotions, places at ( i dunno abt this ) schs. but when it comes to like war....they TEND to stay away from it and say it's the guys' duty. and when shopping, guys pay can carry the bags while the girl shops. it seems that a girl can easily cry rape or molest when voluntary sex is involved. as for molest. COMPLETELY no traces of it is left. what it depends on is how technically possible is it ( some ppl come up with some crap that they are molested when it's simply not possible ) and also how steady is the victim during questioning. then like in pregnant women. after labour returns to work and demands equal pay compared to a equally educated male staff. but the level of experience differs. so can we have equal pay ?</div>

What to do??<br>nan2 ren2 nu3 ren2 plz comment...</div></blockquote>Hiya TaDa,<br><br>Do allow me to reply you on on this.  I think the difference here is that it already is a fact that men have egos.  Psychologists have already written books about it.  Self improvement authors have advised how to control it.  And books and articles have been written to help women handle such egos.<br><br>But women taking the so-called privilege of equal opportunity over the edge is not recognised.  That's what the article was talking about.  The article was about everyday male-bashing that happens right before our eyes.  But notice the inital paragraphs about men keeping quiet?  We keep quiet even when our male bosses tell us to do things that they don't dare to tell our female counterparts to do for fear of being charged with sexual harrassment.<br><br>Let me share with y'all a real eye-opening experience.  When I was in uni Down Under, I was in a state that was the strongest in the women's movement for equal opportunity.  Just outside the library was the main entrance where there're manual swing doors that you had to push to open.  Now, it's only polite to hold the door to let the person behind you in as well.  This well-known feminist was behind a guy who naturally held the door open after he pushed it and entered.  She then punched his arm and asked him, "Wot?  Ye didn't think I could open it meself?"  I was just 2 meters from this.  I heard this loud smack and saw a body fly past me.  Yep, it was the feminist and the guy who held the door open had smacked her upside her head.  He had definitelt opened a can of whoop-ass on her.  Guess what happened when that happened?  Everyone in the foyer cheered, even me.<br><br>What I personally cannot tolerate are women who want things their way, and will cry for equal opportunity when neccessary, but will quickly turn into a shy coy woman and cry, "But I'm a woman!" when things don't work their way.  That is taking equal opportunity over the edge.<br><br>You want equal opportunity?  Work and pay for it.  Don't just show your leg for it.<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>
