            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm i would have to agre on personal space ar...sometimes people have to be careful about invading other peopls space...<br><br>I know that some people dun really think about it or simply dun care...but i tend to keep  that space sothat people dun feel uncomfortable or violated...and even still some people take it that you are trying to invade their space anyway...<br><br>oh well....but a lot of people..both girls and guys tend to not be too concerned about other peopels personal spaces...<br><br>for guys...u be labelled morestor<br><br>for girls....label easy...<br><br>not thet the titles and labels matter but if u are very sociable then the titles make the difference how other people treat and react to u...and that IS important.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe that there are some who are not aware or unintentional of their actions. To them it seems 2nd nature to them.<br>But by retreating backward, changing positions(if more than 2 px) or changing the subject is enough to give them the hint. Would not tell them off unless i'm posiitive that they are doing it with intent.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Abt a year ago, went out with a guy whom I'm not that close with..asked me to go IKEA with him to browse..never went out wif him since coz he acted as though we are super close friends, and keep doing things which i found was inappropriate. e.g. tried to tickle me by poking my waist...touched my shoulders and commented on what i was wearing was skimpy (i was wearing fitted white top with 3 quart sleeves..skimpy meh????)....etc...i thought it was too much for someone whom i hardly know well...didnt even bother to keep in touch wif him ever since.</div>

Like getting too eager and revealing too much to that someone or asking too intimate things about them too soon?</div>
