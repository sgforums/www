Well,if love conquers all, you would have tolerated all other factors to spend your life with him<br><br>humble detector no. 2 - u know u r pretending to be humble when you acknowledge a fact and yet try to hide it.For example, someone gives a compliment thatyou look pretty in the photo, you reply back, stating that you are not photogenic.In other words you are trying to say that you look pretty fascinating in real life<br><br>humble detector no.3-you know you are out to impress when u make a trival thing become a huge "HOO HAA". Let's imagine a scenario here shall we?You go partying in a club like zouk perhaps?and you realised people keep hitting on you.You get kinda big headed because you know you have been getting enormous attention.But hey people, give me a break, isn't being picked up such a norm for us girls here?<br>its passe baby!!!~<br><br>humble detector no. 4 - u know u think too highly of yourself when you reject a guy way b4 he pop the question. For example, you tell a guy, "Promise me that you will not fall in love with me when you meet me." Love cannot be ordered around and what makes u think the guy likes you in the first place?<br><br>humble detector no. 5 - You know you have a big head when you post to tell people you are very busy when you are in Singapore.. You have no time to meet forumites. For example "Sorry to those whom wants to meet me but really I am so occupied for the moment, but there will be one outing before I leave end of the month..." when no one wants to meet you at all.<br>BTW: If you really can't find "real friends" maybe it's about time you ask yourself the big question "WHY????"<br><br>humble detector no. 6 - you know you are in trouble when you eat your own words. for example "I always wonder how could anyone love a person without even meeting the party? And the most ridiculous thing is when he likes a gal in the virtual world." Can I ask you where did you meet your current boyfriend?!<br><br>------------------<br><br>Eat your humble pie!<br></div>
