            <div class='col-md body'>A case of donation money not going to the purpose donors intended it for?? From Straits Times today...<br><br><strong>NKF's reserve of $189m sparks debate </strong><br>By Theresa Tan<br><br>THE National Kidney Foundation (NKF) has $189 million in the bank, enough to fund its programmes for at least three years.<br><br>This is too much, says the chairman of the National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre (NVPC), Mr Willie Cheng, who feels that 'one or two years' of reserves is enough for non-profit organisations unless they have specific development plans.<br><br>National Council of Social Service (NCSS) president Gerard Ee says the NKF could be clearer in telling people how much it has.<br><br>He also disapproves of NKF's practice of not setting a fundraising target: 'If donors know an organisation is accumulating and still asking them for donations, they may not look at you favourably.'<br><br>Their comments come just as the NKF embarks on one of its biggest donation drives of the year - the NKF Charity Show - this weekend.<br><br>While it is one of the most successful non-profit organisations here, the NKF has also attracted controversy with its fundraising practices.<br><br>Just this week, it came under fire for its tie-up with insurance giant Aviva.<br><br>The crux of the discomfort over the size of NKF's reserves is the number of charities fighting for the charity dollar.<br><br>There are more than 1,700 registered charities in Singapore. Yet in 2002, the NKF raised $67.5 million, 18 per cent of the sum of all donations here.<br><br>Still, the NKF says it needs $62.4 million a year to support its 2,000 patients for dialysis and for its other programmes.<br><br>In response to criticism, NKF says that 'charities in Singapore should raise as much funds as they can get' and protect their reserves to ensure that they will have sufficient funds 'for the unpredictable future'.<br><br>Even the NCSS says that non-profit organisations can have up to five years of their net annual operating expenditure in reserves.<br><br>The Community Chest - NCSS' fundraising arm - itself has $150 million in the kitty. Last year, it raised $41 million for over 300,000 beneficiaries.<br><br>The other charity for kidney disease, the Kidney Dialysis Foundation (KDF), had $5.7 million in reserves for 2002, which it hopes will last two years for 190 patients.<br><br>Concerns have also been raised about how the money is used. In an article for Salt, NVPC's magazine, Mr Cheng said that over-funded non-profit organisations could end up splurging on peripherals.<br><br>In 2001, NKF moved into its new $21-million building in Kim Keat Road, funded not by public donations but by the Shaw Foundation, Mr Tay Choon Hye, Singapore Pools, Lee Foundation and the Singapore Buddhist Welfare Services.<br><br>Out of every dollar the NKF raised in 2002, $0.52 went to beneficiaries, and the rest to expenses.<br><br>To qualify for tax-exempt status, charities must spend 80 per cent of its income on its beneficiaries and programmes within a time frame stipulated by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (Iras).<br><br>The NKF says it meets these requirements, as it is tax exempt. It said: 'The difference is that we are able to stretch the spending over a longer period through the solid financial practices that NKF sticks to.'<br><br></div>

You have to remember that to the patients, the centre is like 2nd home. I believe many patients, given a choice, would not wat to trod their way to the centres =&gt;3 times week to a lousy run-down centre. So one of NKF's aim, albeit aesthetic, is to provide them with an excellent environment &amp; service in the centres. In order to do that. they need $$$!<br><br>NKF's not like the public sector who has a ample $$$ to splurge on functions like "curry-favouring farewell dinners" for senior officers.<br><br>If NKF has enough money, they would like to build dialysis centres in places near to the patients. NKF is not like NTUC who has ample $$$ to build their stores in every commercial areas tenderable, resulting in trade monopolizing, leaving FMCG SMEs to fight for bones only,<br><br>As for NKF mgmt driving luxury cars...what's wrong with a manager driving luxury cars? NKF's a business Org! Do you see your manager in a big company driving Honda Civics? Pls dun include Creative Directors who rides Vespas or Minis.<br><br>As for the Aviva tie-up, NKF could have given an opt-out option to its clients. Maybe they already plan to do it, but because some jounalists are real fast on the news, breaking out NKF's plan to the whole world before NKF can fully explain, that is why we have all the hoo-has goin round here.</div></blockquote>yo fren, if u so strongly want to say NKF is an busi org, then pls..go tell ur fren dun come BEG us for money ok??? show us their business plan and convince us to INVEST ok?? then they can have their big car and salary ok??</div>
