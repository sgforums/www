If you already have the preconception that the donations are not being used properly, no matter how much effort the charity tries to explain in details, you woulndt believe.<br><br>Yes, NKF claims to be a non-charitable organisation. I dunno what constitute [b]non-charitable</strong> in today's term, maybe someone can elaborate on this?<br><br>Due to the Aviva tie-up fiasco, NKF do receive lotsa flak, but no one can deny it's marcom success over the years, prior to this fiasco. And it's because of the success, it is able to hurl itself into a forefront charity organisation. If other charities are able to do it, more donations can be channelled into them for the benefit of the needys, not just kidney failure patients.<br>[/b]</blockquote>*shake head* then unfortunately you know little about the powers of persuasion, the channels of persuasion and what public relations can do.....<br><br>a decade ago, starbucks coffee faced that largest PR crisis ever when they were accused of exploiting coffee farmers in third world countries all over the world. Today, they have not only made a complete turnaround of that reputation to be cited as a corporation that practices corporate social responsibility but have also recouped the millions they lost in that fiasco. Both NKF and Starbucks spent loads on corporate collaterals, marcom materials.. but the difference is that Starbucks (albeit under pressure from  lobby groups) gave transparent accounts of how their profits were spent in the corporate social responsibility program.. in rewarding the farmers, promoting ethical market practices in import and export of coffee beans. Though skeptics can still doubt them, but to the general public, they have cleared a hurdle in public relations. Lobby groups can still argue that Starbucks marginalises third world farmers and Starbucks has an equally strong and valid argument that they have bettered the living standards of those farmers in comparison to the rest of the country population from their programs.<br><br>If NKF had been transparent in how they used the donations, the benefits their patients recieved, the entry criteria as a patient of NKF, perhaps that could have served to "educate" and "persuade" the public that they are alright despite their massive reserves.

            <div class='col-md body'>The original article that sparked the news coverage... so note that it's not SPH deliberately picking on NKF... in fact, its the chairman of National Volunteer &amp; Philanthropy Centre himself that first raised the issue,...<br><br><strong>Charity: Donors should pay more heed to the cause </strong><br>By WILLIE CHENG<br><br>IN the commercial world, companies produce goods and services to be sold at prices that hopefully let them recover their costs and make a tidy profit. Those making losses eventually close down, thus reducing supply in the market.<br><br>If existing companies in a market make too much profit, other competitors enter, increasing supply and bringing prices and profits down.<br><br>Adam Smith, the first proponent of laissez-faire, calls this the 'invisible hand' that keeps the market in equilibrium.<br><br>In the non-profit world, non-profit organisations (NPOs) also produce goods and services, but these are not delivered to customers. Rather, they are delivered to beneficiaries who pay nothing or less than the cost of providing these goods and services.<br><br>To make up for any difference between the cost of services produced and what they can recover from their beneficiaries, NPOs rely on the government and the community to raise money and volunteer time.<br><br>However, the fund raising may bear little relation to the nature and value of the services delivered to the beneficiaries. The success of fund raising is often more dependent on connections and the approaches used.<br><br>Consider the increasing popularity of live TV shows featuring personalities, stunts and challenges with call-in donations. The shows' content bears little, if any, relation to the charitable cause.<br><br>In the annual Ren Ci Charity Show, Shi Ming Yi, the charismatic CEO of Ren Ci Hospital, consistently captures the imagination of TV viewers by putting himself on the line. His abseiling last year and ice-man stunt this year alone generated nearly $2 million of the $13-plus million raised in the two years.<br><br>Clinching the right benefactors or supporters can make a big difference in making ends meet. The Courage Fund had the benefit of almost the entire Cabinet rooting for it.<br><br>The Tent, a welfare shelter for troubled teenage girls, struggled with fund raising until it found a benefactor, who auctioned some of her treasured family memorabilia to support its cause. The charity auction raised over $2 million. The Tent spent $350,000 last year and is now able to focus on expansion.<br><br>Of course, in raising funds, the causes and beneficiaries are usually highlighted. But it's debatable whether people give because of the cause or the cleverness of the campaigning.<br><br>A study in contrast would be the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) and the Kidney Dialysis Foundation (KDF). Both causes are similar, but their financial performances are dramatically different.<br><br>In 2002, the KDF raised $1.5 million while NKF raised a staggering $67.5 million in donations. KDF has 174 dialysis patients, while NKF services 2,200 dialysis patients in addition to its other programmes such organ donation advocacy, preventive health care and clinical research.<br><br>KDF and NKF ended their years with a contrasting $0.26-million and $28.8-million surplus respectively. To date, NKF has accumulated a healthy reserve of $189 million, which could potentially fund its operations for the next three years without further fund raising. Certainly, slick marketing and the sometimes controversial fund-raising 'incentives' offered by the NKF have helped in its financial success.<br><br>So there can be little connection between what an NPO actually does - both NKF and KDF have similar goals - and how successful or unsuccessful it is in getting the money to do what it does. There is no invisible hand of Adam Smith to ensure that an NPO raises just enough money to deliver an optimal level of services to its beneficiaries.<br><br>It is possible to have NPOs with more money than they need, and which can end up being splurged on peripherals.<br><br>On the other hand, we could have NPOs serving critical community needs which are unable to find funding to continue. Recently, Humanity &amp; Golden Kids, a non-profit centre run by CancerStory.com that offers complementary cancer treatment methods, closed because funds were short for its operations and publicity efforts.<br><br>Food From The Heart, which was started by an expatriate couple last year to deliver unsold bread from bakeries to charity homes, almost didn't get past its first year. After investing $70,000 of their own money, the Laimers were initially unable to find the remaining $250,000 needed for its first year's operations. It had a reprieve when the President's Challenge 2003 extended it a help line. Today, the Laimers still seek sponsors and support for their second year's growth.<br><br>Is there something we can do about this dichotomy and disconnection between the value of services delivered and the source of funding for those services? Alignment of donations to expenditure can help bridge this divide.<br><br>Trends globally and in Singapore suggest that donors are becoming more discerning about the causes they support and the use of their donations. There is certainly a push by some donors for their hand to be more visible than just in the handouts.<br><br>Major donors are becoming more directly involved with NPOs by being active on their governing boards. They demand a level of accountability and governance similar to that in the corporate world. Some donors are insisting on 'outcome-based funding' of programmes for better alignment between funding and its purpose.<br><br>Significant donors can do these. It is more difficult for the mass of smaller donors in the larger community to be similarly involved.<br><br>The visible hand of the donor is not the complete equivalent of the invisible hand of Adam Smith. When they do get involved, donors are, in a sense, deciding on behalf of the beneficiaries. In the free market, it is the customers, not surrogates, who make the final call on the value of services delivered.<br><br>Donors have their own perspectives and motivations, separate from the beneficiaries and perhaps the greater community's interests. Nevertheless, when donors demand greater accountability from NPOs, and when they pay attention to the cause, there is more likely to be better alignment between the money raised and the money spent.<br><br>The writer is chairman of the National Volunteer &amp; Philanthropy Centre.
