            <div class='col-md body'>ohh icic so sorry<br><br>anyway the issue i pointed out wasn't about whether the govt has spent their revenue unwisely and thus dun haf enuff left to help<br>those in need, rather im trying to make the point that we can't always depend on the govt. i mean if one day the govt happens to run into a huge budget deficit and decided not to contribute money to help those who are sick, then are we just going to sit back and complain, simply becos we feel that it's the govt's job to take care of these patients?<br><br>maybe u do have a different viewpoint, but personally i think complaining is not going to help much... so taking some pracitical actions seems more realistic to me...</div>
