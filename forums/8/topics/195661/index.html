            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>(Was copied from an email that was sent to me)<br><br>I still remember when my office phone rang,my wife was on the line saying that she spotted a maisonette in The Strait Time and it was in Jurong West St 42 Blk xxx and the price was attractive!!.So we arranged a viewing with the agent and bought it on the spot!<br><br>A little bit of history I'm going to mention so that if you came across similiar case do consider carefully. When we viewed the flat, we found that it was renovated extensively and we were told that the owner only stayed for a short while and moved out. When their rented shop unit from HDB arrived, they move to stay upstairs the unit. Indeed, we did found that it was true when we went over to the shop to place a deposit and signed the sale &amp; purchase agreement. But we found out later that the owner had the shop all along and they moved out for some reasons.<br><br>As the owner had bought the flats from HDB direct, they can't sell the flat yet(5 yrs rule) so they moved out to a rented flat and later rented a shop unit. I came to know from neighbours later and that more that 10 families had came &amp; went during these time. So please check with the surrounding neighbours before you purchase a flat which now I learn. Ok! now I will listed all the incidences happened during my two and the half years there.<br><br>1) As you know, maisonette go two levels, all the rooms are upstair. As I was watching TV in the hall, I used to see several times a black shadow darting at the stairs.<br><br>2) One night after watching TV alone, I think it was about 2.00am and I was walking past the stairs to go upstair to sleep, I heard a  voice(very clear) calling me "Papa!" once and instinctly I turn my head to my left where the voice came from. My whole body went cold when there was nothing there at all!. My wife and only daughter were sleeping soundly upstair.<br><br>3) It was in the afternoon, my wife was washing her hair in the toilet upstair. As she was sitting on the stool bending forward holding the shower above her head washing her hair. Suddenly, she felt that someone gave her a hard push above her head. She unable to see that time coz her eyes was covered with shampoo. Then immediately, she open her eyes and call out to my daughter. She found that my daughter was indeed downstair playing<br>in the hall all the time.<br><br>4) (This one is rather spooky) It was when a new neighbour moved in next door and when they came over to get to know us. My wife was at the gate chatting with them. And my daughter and I was watching TV in the hall. The next evening after dinner in the hawker centre, we met them in the lift. Then, during our conversation, they mentioned, "Where is your boy?" We told them that we only got a daughter but they insisted that they saw themself, my<br>daughter in the hall watching TV and there was a boy at the staircase playing and he was about 5 yrs old!!. Both husband &amp; wife saw that!.<br><br>5) There was one evening at about 10.00pm. I was having my bath upstair then when I turn to face the wall behind me, I got a shocked!! There was a transparent figure like a human (don't know gal or guy) moved from one wall to another!. I was shaking like a leave and naturally used the hot shower spray and spray to that direction. Nothing happen at all so I quickly rushed out.<br><br>6) This last one is the final straw we able to take before we moved out to our private apartment which happened the tenancy just expires.(Pls note: can only sell after two &amp; the half years for resale flat). I forgot to mentioned that all this time during the night when we are sleeping in our locked master bedroom, we always heard noises like someone twisting our room handle and trying to open the door. I did checked many times to no avail.<br>Ok!...One evening after watching TV, we all went upstair to sleep. As we entered our masteroom, I wanted to switch on the TV in the room to continue watching the program. We all got a shock! There was a pair of deep lighted shinning blue eyes on the TV screen. The TV was not even switch on!!. Just to make sure is not a fault, I even pull out the plug from the socket!!. The pair of eyes was still there!!.<br><br>So all of us rush to the second guestroom and locked ourself inside. Both my wife and daughter are crying like shit. I was also shivering but had to put up a brave front. While they fallen asleep later, I stayed up till morning. Guess what?....We moved that morning!! This is a true incidences witness by three of us! Take care when hunting for a home.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by magnetgal:</div><div class="quote_body">(Was copied from an email that was sent to me)<br><br>I still remember when my office phone rang,my wife was on the line saying that she spotted a maisonette in The Strait Time and it was in Jurong West St 42 Blk xxx and the price was attractive!!.So we arranged a viewing with the agent and bought it on the spot!<br><br>A little bit of history I'm going to mention so that if you came across similiar case do consider carefully. When we viewed the flat, we found that it was renovated extensively and we were told that the owner only stayed for a short while and moved out. When their rented shop unit from HDB arrived, they move to stay upstairs the unit. Indeed, we did found that it was true when we went over to the shop to place a deposit and signed the sale &amp; purchase agreement. But we found out later that the owner had the shop all along and they moved out for some reasons.<br><br>As the owner had bought the flats from HDB direct, they can't sell the flat yet(5 yrs rule) so they moved out to a rented flat and later rented a shop unit. I came to know from neighbours later and that more that 10 families had came &amp; went during these time. So please check with the surrounding neighbours before you purchase a flat which now I learn. Ok! now I will listed all the incidences happened during my two and the half years there.<br><br>1) As you know, maisonette go two levels, all the rooms are upstair. As I was watching TV in the hall, I used to see several times a black shadow darting at the stairs.<br><br>2) One night after watching TV alone, I think it was about 2.00am and I was walking past the stairs to go upstair to sleep, I heard a  voice(very clear) calling me "Papa!" once and instinctly I turn my head to my left where the voice came from. My whole body went cold when there was nothing there at all!. My wife and only daughter were sleeping soundly upstair.<br><br>3) It was in the afternoon, my wife was washing her hair in the toilet upstair. As she was sitting on the stool bending forward holding the shower above her head washing her hair. Suddenly, she felt that someone gave her a hard push above her head. She unable to see that time coz her eyes was covered with shampoo. Then immediately, she open her eyes and call out to my daughter. She found that my daughter was indeed downstair playing<br>in the hall all the time.<br><br>4) (This one is rather spooky) It was when a new neighbour moved in next door and when they came over to get to know us. My wife was at the gate chatting with them. And my daughter and I was watching TV in the hall. The next evening after dinner in the hawker centre, we met them in the lift. Then, during our conversation, they mentioned, "Where is your boy?" We told them that we only got a daughter but they insisted that they saw themself, my<br>daughter in the hall watching TV and there was a boy at the staircase playing and he was about 5 yrs old!!. Both husband &amp; wife saw that!.<br><br>5) There was one evening at about 10.00pm. I was having my bath upstair then when I turn to face the wall behind me, I got a shocked!! There was a transparent figure like a human (don't know gal or guy) moved from one wall to another!. I was shaking like a leave and naturally used the hot shower spray and spray to that direction. Nothing happen at all so I quickly rushed out.<br><br>6) This last one is the final straw we able to take before we moved out to our private apartment which happened the tenancy just expires.(Pls note: can only sell after two &amp; the half years for resale flat). I forgot to mentioned that all this time during the night when we are sleeping in our locked master bedroom, we always heard noises like someone twisting our room handle and trying to open the door. I did checked many times to no avail.<br>Ok!...One evening after watching TV, we all went upstair to sleep. As we entered our masteroom, I wanted to switch on the TV in the room to continue watching the program. We all got a shock! There was a pair of deep lighted shinning blue eyes on the TV screen. The TV was not even switch on!!. Just to make sure is not a fault, I even pull out the plug from the socket!!. The pair of eyes was still there!!.<br><br>So all of us rush to the second guestroom and locked ourself inside. Both my wife and daughter are crying like shit. I was also shivering but had to put up a brave front. While they fallen asleep later, I stayed up till morning. Guess what?....We moved that morning!! This is a true incidences witness by three of us! Take care when hunting for a home.<br><br></div></blockquote>Blk 405 is haunted. That much I can tell you.</div>
