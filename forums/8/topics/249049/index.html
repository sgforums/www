            <div class='col-md body'>I lived in the eastern part of Singapore and often would spent my lunchtime in the east particularly places like Bedok and Pasir ris. But one particular incident had never leave my mind for years that follows. For one day while I was walking down bedok central. Passing by shops when something caught my eye. It was a old lady about the age of 70 and above... scanning thru the garbage bin searching for things behind the NTUC. For a moment I thought why would a lady like her in Singapore searching for things in the garbage bin. I would have thought that Singapore government had dealt with the problems of poverty and there shouldn't be a sight like this.<br><br>For a moment I had an urge. I went to the nearest ATM and draw $50 and walked back, soon I was half joggin back to where I found the old lady. Approaches her and asked：" Why are you finding fruits front the rubbish bins, its not good." As she turned and I could see a winkled face who been through years of weathering and hardship. Not one you would have in mind gentle and pamperness. She explained that she is just finding fruits for birds, although the fruits are still in nicely packed packages. It wasn't hard for me to see that she is lying, I handed over the money to her and ask her not to find anymore fruits. She taken them in joy and red wetted tears begin to roll down her eyes and mine.<br><br>That day I went home, wondering for years I believed in God who is almighty, promises us a bruise reed he will not break and not to worry for even the sparrows are taken care of. For many times I'm been taught that we are the apple of our Fathers eyes that shouldn't them all be protected and cared upon. If God is such a almighty God why wasn't he doing something to help people like such, why than him allowed a pitiful poor lady by the back of the street picking fruits and not help? Somehow I was little angry with God himself as I whimper my way home. Then of a sudden, I smiled. Perhaps He had already sent, He sent me.<br></div>
