              <p>Hello all,</p>
              <p>I'm thinking of getting a pair of RGP hard contact lenses<span id="GRmark_86a5404c1d1991c18297b327eb35eca93cfbb8de_.:0" class="GRcorrect">.</span>I found from google, there are 2 models got a good reputation, Boston XO2 and Menicon Z.</p>
              <p>Does anyone have experience RGP contact lenses? What brand and model you are using? How's the cost?</p>
              <p>Appreciate any idea</p>

              <p>Hello,</p>
              <p>I am also curious about the price, though not much so for the experience (you can read about the experiences in many other sites). I have not have RGP lenses before so I will not be very helpful, but I would like to share my two cents. :3</p>
              <p>I will be letting my optometrist decide on the brand of lenses for me, because he will know best what type of brand fits my type of eyes, like whether my eyes are really dry or not, I reckon. Also, he should be the most experienced in which brand is most used by people, and which have received the most positive feedback.</p>
              <p>If I just base my preferrence for a brand based on others' experience... I don't think their experience will really be the same for me. So, I'm going to let my optometrist decide on most of the things. Maybe even everything?</p>
              <p>I'm new to this RGP thing, so don't take my reply seriously. I just want to let you know there is someone who is also curious about the price. :P</p>
              <p> Edit:</p>
              <p>Where can I get RGP lenses? Normal spectacle shops don't seem to sell those. Going to SNEC scares me, because I'm under 18 and I don't have that much money for eye examinations and other procedures that I dunno about!</p>
              <p>Toric lenses are expensive compared to RGP in the long run so I really want a RGP..</p>

              <p>Hello peeps, I have used RGP lenses before and now I am using Ortho K .</p>
              <p>Go to a certified Optometrist/Opthamologist to get it fitted.</p>
              <p>The optometrist/opthamologist must talk to you and check your eyes to make sure you are a SUITABLE candidate for hard lenses.</p>
              <p>Some people are not suitable for hard lenses. </p>
              <p>Daily hygiene , tolerance to hard lenses all varies individually.</p>
              <p>If you have not used hard lenses before... you will find it very uncomfortable the first few days... after your eyes get used to hard lenses... you won't find it irritating anymore.</p>
              <p>Hard lenses are better for your eyes compared to soft lenses. Also they provide better vision clarity.</p>
              <p>There are several brands in the market... different material content , your optometrist/opthamologist should have some sample for you to try before committing to one pair.</p>
              <p>Be aware that a more exprience fitter is capable of giving you a better fit which means better comfort.</p>
              <p>I've been to bad fitter.. with lack of experience in RGP and the fit was horrible.</p>
              <p>So shop around for someone who has experience or is properly trained to fit RGP.</p>

              <p>My previous pair of RGP is about $380  ( One year ) I don't know what's the market rate today. Back then I don't have many choices ..now I see so many different types ...Different materials... hybrids for better comfort , so I'm sure the cost varies. </p>
              <p>I had to replace one lens cuz I dropped it into sink hole at public toilet. That's about $150.</p>
              <p>Call up your optometrist/opthamologist and get a quote over the phone. Just tell them u are considering, but would like to know if it is within your budget. They will be able to tell u a price range over the phone. </p>
              <p>As for my ortho k. It's $900 including follow up service for one year... Sorta a package my opto offered. So far so good.. Actually I'm loving it. L</p>
              <p>Note : hard lenses are very sensitive to dust. So If u are in a dusty environment often, u won't like hard lenses ...so u might want to give that some thought before u invest in one.   ?.i used to work in mostly office settings, ..Then my work environment changed and needed to spend more time outside ... so i had to Switch to Otho k ..  </p>

              <p>I think SNEC is more for eye disease, but they may offer opto service. My opto is both an optometrist And Opthamologist...She is basically a doctor...so call up SNEC to find out if they do opto too. </p>
              <p>Or, U can ask your optometrist if they fit RGPs, most probably do. They will topograph your Eye balls with a machine n figure out your fit. </p>
              <p>Just make sure your opto Is experienced in fitting the lens. I m not sure if they need any certification to fit RGPs...like all good practitioners.. I usually see how they respond to my concern n observe if they are forthcoming with information. </p>
              <p>If they know a lot, they will tell u plenty. </p>
              <p>If they just shrug u off and don't address your concerns, then I wouldn't trust him/her.</p>
              <p>when u put the lens on first time, it should bE uncomfortable, but NOT painful. </p>
              <p>If it stings, could be due to foreign particle. Rinse eye n lens, then try again.</p>
              <p>If the fit is bad, the lens will not move properly. The hard lens should glide on your eye when u blink. </p>
              <p>If u experience pain , after rinsing ur lens n eye to make sure its not due to dust , u should inform your opto, they may need to adjust the fit again. </p>
              <p>anyway, I will be On abroad trip , so I won't be replying.. good luck with your search !  </p>
