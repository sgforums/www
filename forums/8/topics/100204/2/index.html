I think it's only China govt that are still insisting the history and apologises. I always travel to China for biz and they are crazy over Japanese sutffs.<br><br>Have anyone thought if they apologise, what will become of Japan when the economy is already so bad. Another thing is Asian felt that ' face' is important, have you seen any asian really apologise publicly? It's really rare.<br><br>Just like Germany, not all supported Nazi and even for soldiers, some even help the jews too. As for Japan invade, not all Japanese actually supported their invade. Plus all the citizen in Japan did not know what really happened outside Japan as there were never any real news reports to them.<br><br>From another point of view, have you ever thought why was Japan able to be the first country in Asia that is so small yet able to won the war with Russia. In additional, able to conquer so many countries down to Indonesia. What about after war, why can they be one of the developed countries which many look upon.  Where are there so many Japanese MNC around the world? Why are there so many creations by Japanese? Why have they done that everywhere in the world, we can see signs of Japanese stuff?<br><br>This is something that we can probe on what make they so strong?<br><br>Pain created by history is truth, but to hate and continuously beware of them, it's waste of energy. Forgive but remember it is important.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One day duing my CL2 lesson, my chinese teacher made a remark. He said that while chinese contribute a lot to the world, especially the inventions, we are the most 'useless' ethnic group in the world.<br><br>Look at Chinese 5000 years of wars and political bickerings. Plus a stickler for regressive tradition, such as 'face' and 'profitting'. Why u think chinese make clever businessmen, as opposed to being wise and having foresight?<br><br>If China ever want to be progressive in all areas, it must change the way Chinese usually think. Making continual issues out the war wouldnt help. They are not pursuing 'forgive and forget' policy, its more like 'settling old debts'.<br><br></div>

Seems like most of us are the forgiving type.</div></blockquote>I have quite a few chinese nationals classmates. Always come out for dinner monthly after graduation. Through discussions and chitchatting wif them i think it is mainly due to the education system in china. While we r having CME during secondary sch, they have a subject call politics and somemore their history textbk is very biased not like our secondary sch history textbk(more focused on relating to u wat happened). In a way they r 'taught to hate'.So hence they think it isnt wrg to hate the japs.</div>

Well, i hate to tell you this, but 99% of Japanese than, wake up every morning and pray to Hirohito. who was the CIC of the Jap war.<br><br>i've lost a grandparent in the Jap-Sino war. i feel differently from you guys. how do u expect me to forget and forgive something, which hasn't been apologised for? and whom Japan continues to stake a innocent-stance?<br><br>ps: look at japanese textbooks. the chinese are taught to hate. the japanese are taught that, they've only killed 30k chinese during the war. wad a neglection of obligation.</div></blockquote>Well, if you asked me, my grandfather fought against the japanese, got shot, managed to survive the war. He quite alot of his family members though. I was told about this story many times. But personally I never really go to the extend of hating them. Cos it is no longer my war, or the current generation's war now. I do hope they would come clean and just tell their own people the truth. And i also have to tell you that a few years back, when the students were asked what they want to be included in their education, majaority of them want their gov to come clean and talk about the war. So at least there are some who want to know something.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Forgive but not forget. That's true of the atrocities the japs heaped on us and many other nations they conquered.<br><br>Let's not forget that these war crimes were committed by the previous generation and not the current batch of japs. That aside, the japs of that generation are indeed a gracious bunch. I know coz i served them at a restaurant while i was waitering. Not all of them should be held accountable for Imperial army's actions before and during WWII. And for those sadistic ones, i can highlight equally perverse monsters that aren't japanese in just about every part of ther world.<br><br>Furthermore, they have paid for this with over 60 years of international hate and trade embargoes. For a nation which holds honour and pride with such high esteem, it is without doubt their greatest humiliation. Shall we continue to condemn them to their children and their children's generations? When will the hate end?<br><br>Forgive...yes. Perhaps even in time, we may learn to forget.<br><br></div>
