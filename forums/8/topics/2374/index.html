            <div class='col-md body'>some guys are a bit soft and some are rough. it's hard to tell all the guys to be brave. Some girls like guys who are a bit shy and some like those very daring and bold one.<br><br>sometimes it's not whether a guy wats to try his luck or something but just got no motivation. Some got hurt badly in the past and dunt feel like taking chances if he dun't see any response from the girl. I find this whole process quite natural. If the girl does have a bit interest in one particular guy just try to be friendly to him loh. and if the guy is interested in her usually will act a bit different compare to other guys rite?

FIREICE, WO AI NI!  :p<br>I think i know why guys so shy... becos usually when i feel shy, it is becos i really really really like the girl a lot lot lot lot lot. When that certain girl catches your heart so much, you rather things stay just the way it is, leave no bad impression and fantasize she might be feeling the same way about you. *sigh* the bitter sweet feeling of 'an lian' a person, how long have you felt tat?

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm a 24 year old shy guy who's never had a BGR before (a bit pathetic, i guess, compared to all u younger boys and girls out there).  However, this is not from a lack of trying.  I've liked a few girls over the years and tried to court them.  However, there are a few problems preventing me from getting into a relationship.  Being shy means taking a longer time to get to know a girl, and some more time trying to build up courage to ask her out.  This, i did, eventually.  However, the main obstacle i faced is that Singapore girls generally do not like shy guys.  I think this is evident from all those postings in dating websites, where the girls always say "i want a witty, humorous guy to be my bf".  Shy guys already have trouble chatting with the girls they like, so how to be witty and humorous in front of them?  I guess that's why i was rejected, even though i'm a nice guy (from what people around me told me, not from what my ego tells me) and of average looks.  From what i can see, there are a lot of guys out there who have the same problem that i do.  Therefore, i hope that girls who read this posting can ease up on their standards for bfs.  Give that shy nice guy in your class who sneaks occasional peeks at u but dares not to speak to u a chance.  Consider him instead of dismissing him outright.  Then, if u feel that he is of good character, go ahead and talk to him more often to bring him out of his shell (girls can be proactive in this day and age, right?)  I think shy guys are a good bet for girls who want a long-term relationship, since they are too shy to chat up other girls.  So girls, give my words some thought, ok?</div>
