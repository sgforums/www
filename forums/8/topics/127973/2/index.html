            <div class='col-md body'>It is one thing to get a low pay for the first few years of your career.<br><br>However, I have noted that a lot of people have been stuck with the same pay for the past 3 to 4 years with little or no increment.  Most of my peers have commented that their companies have frozen salaries since they joined 3 to 4 years ago with only a small token increment when things were better in 2003/04.<br><br>A fresh grad now may be earning only slightly less than someone who has had 3 to 4 years of experience.  If the fresh grad is lucky and manages to get a well paying job say $2K + , chances are his colleagues who have had worked in the same company for 2 to 3 years may only be earning $2.2K.  In some cases, the fresh grad may even be paid more than those who have worked in the same company for 2 to 3 years.  Reason being the earlier people were earning low salaries during the "slump" and company policy dictate that they cannot just adjust the salaries upwards by more than a certain percentage every year.<br><br>So if you were earning say $1.4K during the tough times 3 years ago, the company could only adjust your salary by say another $200 or at best $400 now.<br>Compare that to a fresh grad who may come in at $2K, you will see the great wage disparity.<br><br>These are just some of my observations with my friends who ultimately had no choice but to leave the company to try get a higher paying job.<br><br>Even then, some firms will exploit the situation by giving you an increment based on your last drawn pay ie. saying they can't adjust your salary to market because of your previous low pay.  Either way, your salary will likely be squeezed down.<br><br>The only way I guess would be to keep job hopping every 1 to 2 years to get a wage increase.</div>
