He may have seen it in a report in The New Paper, about a gem scam, two years ago.<br><br>Too bad it didn't stop him from buying what he thought were rubies and sapphires.<br><br>He said he spent about $1,300, only to come back to Singapore and find they were almost worthless.<br><br>And to make it worse, it was the first time he was buying such an expensive present for his girlfriend.<br><br>Mr Ng, 28, a retail manager, was holidaying in Bangkok last month with Miss L Lim, 23, his girlfriend of three years.<br><br>TOO GOOD TO REFUSE<br><br>On their second day there, they met a tuk-tuk driver outside the Bangkok Palace Hotel, where they were staying. He offered to drive them around all day for 20 baht (about 80 cents). They thought it was too good an offer to refuse and asked to be taken to Siam Square.<br><br>Mr Ng said: 'It was about 10am and the driver, who said his name was Black Diamond, told us that Thai shops open only at 11am. He suggested we visit a temple.'<br><br>They were not keen on that, but the driver insisted.<br><br>At the temple, they saw a well-dressed man praying. The man then started a conversation with them.<br><br>Mr Ng said: 'He told us we were very lucky to be there that day, which he claimed was Lucky Buddha Day, as the temple was open to the public only on that day.'<br><br>The man claimed to be a Thai businessman based in the US and said he used to be a monk at the temple.<br><br>'He even showed us pictures of himself as a monk,' said Mr Ng.<br><br>Then, the man showed them a ruby and sapphire ring, saying the former is lucky for women and the latter for men.<br><br>They were told that if they did not want the jewellery for themselves, they could sell it for a profit in Singapore.<br><br>The shop to buy it from - Yindee Lapidary.<br><br>Mr Ng said: 'After chatting with the man, we asked Black Diamond to take us to Siam Square, but the next thing we knew, we were outside Yindee Lapidary.'<br><br>And Mr Ng ended up buying two rings. A ruby set on an 18 carat white gold ring for about $1,100 for Miss Lim and a sapphire set on a silver ring for over $200 for himself. He paid with his credit card.<br><br>The ruby ring came with a certificate. But a nagging doubt remained in his mind. After he returned to Singapore, he searched the Internet for the shop's name.<br><br>HIS HEART SANK<br><br>And his heart sank when he saw various reports of other people who claimed to have been cheated.<br><br>He then had the rings valued at a pawn shop and was told the ruby ring was worth about $40, and the other one was worthless.<br><br>Mr Ng has made reports with the Thai embassy and tourism authority.<br><br>But he said he has come to terms with what happened. 'It's fated. We've been cheated, and that's that.'<br><br>Miss Lim, a freelance graphic designer, was less philosophical.<br><br>She said: 'Of course I was upset... I cried the whole night.<br><br>'It's the first time he's shopped for me and then it turned out that he spent money on something that isn't worth the amount.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Be wary of strangers who offer good deals<br><br>THE Thailand Tourism Authority (TAT) has received about 50 complaints about dishonest merchants in the last two years. And 30 of them were against Yindee Lapidary.<br><br>Ms Plernpit Muenpon, TAT Singapore's assistant director, said that in some cases tourists had spent up to $11,000.<br><br>She said TAT distributes 'Please say NO' leaflets warning tourists of scams.<br><br>'Tourists are advised not to trust any offer of investment by strangers who approach them on the streets,' she said.<br><br>Tourists are approached by conmen who offer them deals such as 'last day promotion' and convince them they can sell the jewellery at double the price in Singapore.<br><br>In some cases, the TAT as acted as mediator between tourists and the shops involved.<br><br>If the buyer and seller can come to an agreement, the TAT makes an appointment for them to meet and the Tourist Assistance Centre in Bangkok can provide a witness as well.<br><br>Tourists who find they might have been cheated can contact the Office of Tourism Development for assistance.<br><br>The office is at 154 Rama 1 Road, Phatumwan, Bangkok, 10330. Telephone: 662-216-512 or 219-4010, extension 250 or 251. E-mail: chompunut_<br>&gt;p@tourist.go.th.<br><br>The New Paper tried to call Yindee Lapidiary, on the number on Mr Ng's receipt. No-one answered the phone.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For hotels i would recommend Asia Hotel -it quite basic - no luxury but affordable and its location is very very convenient as the Train (MRT) is connected to it. Its just one stop away from Singaporeans fave shopping hangout -the massive MBK and SIAM Discovery Centre. Price for a twin room is about S$40ish... I believe they are having a promo if you book through the net, slightly cheaper and later check out time - 3pm.<br>Good luck with your trip!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Went to bangkok(first trip) last month on tiger airways, took the $1 tickets. Book Asia Hotel after many recommendations from friends.<br><br>Tiger Airways are okay. Remember to have a full stomach before flying, as you might not used to not getting served on the plane.<br><br>Asia Hotel is pretty good(value for $). BTS(MRT in Spore) can bring you lots of places. Siam, MBK are walking distance. For 5/6 days in the same hotel, i doubt you will enjoy the almost similiar breakfast every days. Gym equipments are old nevertheless working. The only two electronic equipments are running probably are the 2 threads mill and 1 cycle machine.<br><br>Beware of taxi/tuk tuk outside the hotel or anywhere that are stationary waiting for people. Taxi should insisted on the meter fares, if they negotiate do not even bother taking them, just step out of the taxi. Tuk Tuk have to negotiate with them. Try not to take Tuk Tuk, unless you want to try it due to novety and do not mind the smoke from the cars. Always flag a taxi that is empty and is on the move.<br><br>Beware of Taxi/Tuk Tuk that tells you this shop/place, is not "open" for business yet....99% the shop should be opened, speak to the hotel staffs for advised before hand. They just want you to go for some jewellery/clothes/antique shops to buy something so that they can get fuel coupons as their commissions.<br><br>Beware of strangers (at Siam or anywhere) that is "too friendly" to you, they can be teachers, professional, auntie(40-50yrs), Housewife offering assistance to you. They gonna ask you to visit some jewellery/clothes/antique shops. Be alert and do not follow their recommendations.<br><br>Stick to your plan and be firm what you want to do/go. If in doubt, just walk away. You can't lose much. Do not let greed overpower.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

Then hor.. if transport.. <strong>tutu or taxi is a nice option</strong>, u can bargain the price wif the tutu driver before goin up. if u taking thr taxi u can ask to charge thru meter.. more cheaper that way.. i went bangkok for <strong>5 days 4 nite i oni pay 50 buck for the hotel.. </strong>Well i book garuda the indonesia airline.. at first we tot is cheap bt then nah.. normal lor..  when we was there 2 mth ago.. we nv took any mrt..coz u go there u sure wun wan to waste time takint the mrt wan.. so taxi is gd for abit far journey.. while tutu is nice for short one. i overall spent 400 altogher.. when go eatin rite.. u can go to restuarant.. trust me.. it is still very cheap.. and u can eat gd food.. dun think of saving money in eating food.. coz the street food is nt that clean actuali.. i pass by chinatown there.. and u can see fly ard the raw food.. omg.. bt u can try the deep fried incet.. lol.. it salty and cruncy... my fren did try their street food.. nth haben.. so if u dare u can try... <strong>habe a nice trip</strong></div>
