            <div class='col-md body'>sounds like the only reason flirt would want to hold a girl's hand is not so much of not conforming to societal norms... but more of for the kick (if any) to be derived from physical contact with a girl's hand....<br><br>SAD CASE..........</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Stop blaming society to try to justify your own actions lah. Holding hands is a sign of affection, because its basic human contact. You do it for different reasons in different situations. E.g. you hold a girls hand to pull her out of water.<br><br>But, if you are walking the street and you want to hold hands, I just can't see that you are just supporting her. Like Enigma said, its for your own kick. You want to hold hands with someone else other than your gf(or bf if you are a lady) and convince yourself that you are not betraying your gf (or bf), suit yourself.<br><br>[This message has been edited by pacman (edited 07-12-1999).]</div>

Take the fact that holding hands side by side is a normal thing and everyone else is probably going somewhere or doing something.<br><br>There are many different reasons why would people hold hands for.

            <div class='col-md body'>I always find it difficult to hold hands with a guy for a first time. When your hand is in another person's, he can feel your every move, every twitch and vice versa. To me, holding hands with another person brings me a lot closer to him. It's also a sign of affection.<br><br>To be frank, I've never held hands with two of my exs (not telling exactly how many I've had before <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">) My relationship with these two guys were rocky. I wasn't ready to announce to the whole world that we're together. And I didn't feel close enough to them to want to hold their hands. Call me 'old fashioned' but holding hands is a milestone in a relationship for me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When guys try to hold ur hand for the first time, they're trying their luck. They dun know whether you'll like it. So if you just pull your hand out, the guy will get the hint. If he doesn't, do it a few more times. If he still doesn't, then he probably doesn't respect you as an individual.

ATTACHED!!!! then it's announced throughout orch. can just go hide my face and cry....<br><br>so i only hold hands when in a big group.. haha. then all of us hold hands together.. yes, veryvery corny, but... hell, we're a close bunch. what's wrong with holding hands?? but i think, that because everyone knows what society and the people around would think, most of them would conform. and thus, when they see others doing it, they assume the person is conforming as well, and.. well. assume makes an ass out of you and me. i honestly find it very stupid.. i have girl friends, where we would hold hands... in sch, going out.. but once we reach town? automatic stop.
