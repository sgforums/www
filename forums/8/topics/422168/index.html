              <p>1 of my friend lose her handphone in the office toilet.</p>
              <p>The toilet is located in her office which means that only staff can enter the toilet.</p>
              <p>She went into the toilet and forgot to take out her handphone when she came out of the toilet. Less than 5 minutes later she went back to the toilet but the handphone was no longer there.</p>
              <p>Clearly, it is an insider job.</p>
              <p>So she went to the police station to make a report and the policeman point to a sign in the station which shows the list of lost items that don't need to make police report.</p>
              <p>1. NRIC</p>
              <p>2. Passport</p>
              <p>3. Handphone</p>
              <p>4. Bicycle.</p>
              <p>She ask the police officer if lost NRIC don't need to make police report than what if people use your NRIC to borrow money from loanshark and loanshark come harras you.</p>
              <p>He say if that happens the person than come and make police report.</p>
              <p>Is this right?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>1) Lose NRIC - Call ICA. There is no need to inform police. ICA will give you a few weeks' grace to find your IC. If you cant find it, there goes your $100 for your new IC.<br><br>2) Lose Passport - Call ICA. There is no need to inform police. ICA will issue you a new passport. Think its $70. <br><br>3) Lose handphone - Call Singtel/Starhub/M1 to temporarily terminate your line and get a replacement SIM card.<br><br>4) Lose bicycle - Too bad it happened. <br><br>Police only handle cases whereby you get robbed, killed or murdered. <br>Lose items. Its your carelessness. The only thing you can do it to ask the security officers in your office to search every single staff lor.</p></div>

              <p>1 of my friend lose her handphone in the office toilet.</p>
              <p>The toilet is located in her office which means that only staff
                  can enter the toilet.</p>
              <p>She went into the toilet and forgot to take out her handphone
                  when she came out of the toilet. Less than 5 minutes later she went
                  back to the toilet but the handphone was no longer there.</p>
              <p>Clearly, it is an insider job.</p>
              <p>So she went to the police station to make a report and the
                  policeman point to a sign in the station which shows the list of
                  lost items that don't need to make police report.</p>
              <p>1. NRIC</p>
              <p>2. Passport</p>
              <p>3. Handphone</p>
              <p>4. Bicycle.</p>
              <p>She ask the police officer if lost NRIC don't need to make
                  police report than what if people use your NRIC to borrow money
                  from loanshark and loanshark come harras you.</p>
              <p>He say if that happens the person than come and make police
                  report.</p>
              <p>Is this right?</p>
