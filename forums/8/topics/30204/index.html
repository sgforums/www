They have learnt from health upsets in   the past how important their<br>well being is. Lovers of fresh foods, many a Capricorn's garden is filled<br>with herbs and vegies, organically  grown to provide them with inner<br>fortitude to face the world. They are  great hosts and fabulous cooks. They<br>operate and feel best when they avoid  sugar, alcohol and ice-cream.<br><br><strong>AQUARIUS</strong><br>CREATURE OF HABIT<br><br>It's not unusual for Aquarians to eat exactly the same breakfast, lunch and<br>dinner everyday. They don't enjoy surprises, particularly when it comes to<br>food. They are not into cooking for   pleasure, but will cook something to<br>eat. They are content eating  snacks such as biscuits and cheese with a<br>glass of wine. This is enough to  tide them over until they have a real<br>meal- an evening out or a meal prepared by someone else.<br><br><strong>PISCES</strong><br>SWEET TREATS<br><br>Sweet dreams hold a special meaning for Pisceans.  For them, it means going<br>to bed loaded with chocolate and biscuits. Many have a love/hate affair<br>with food. They love to eat but hate putting on weight. Many eat to ease<br>troubled minds. That's why so many are constantly going on a diet, then off again. When Pisces puts on lots of weight and keeps it on, it's an indication they<br>are protecting themselves.<br><br><strong>ARIES</strong><br>THE MUNCHER<br><br>Aries often look forward to meals with anticipation, but generally don't<br>like preparing food. These munchers love to crunch on foods with texture,<br>rather than smooth foods. They enjoy having a full tummy. It's surprising<br>we don't see more "heavy" people born under Aries - being such an active sign,<br>they burn their weight off with mental and physical activity. Feed them<br>quickly as they become irritable when hungry.<br><br><strong>TAURUS</strong><br>THE SELF-INDULGER<br><br>Willpower is hard for Taureans to summon up when they diet. Many a<br>Taurean's life revolves around what the next meal will be. At health clubs and gyms, you will see them working overtime  to lose a few kilos, only to indulge in<br>a chocolate sundae after their workout. They are excellent cooks<br>(particularly desserts). There are  more professional chefs and authors of<br>cook books from this sign than  any other.<br><br><strong>GEMINI</strong><br>ALL OR NOTHING<br><br>Geminis often need to carefully plan their diet and watch their eating<br>habits, because these areas of their life can spin out of control. They<br>often eat on the run, have strange food desires, unusual snacks or many<br>drinks (such as coffee) during the day. Overeating (or drinking and<br>smoking) can become Gemini's outlet for nervous energy. Equally, Geminis rate high on the statistical list of anorexics.<br><br><strong>CANCER</strong><br>THE MOOD EATER<br><br>Food means a lot to Cancer, because it has a lot to do with feeling loved<br>and comfortable. As Cancer is the sign which rules the tummy, everything<br>they eat has a profound impact on them. Eating excessively can be their<br>outlet for emotional turmoil, especially if they have been through an upset<br>such as marriage break-up or a job disappointment, or have financial<br>difficulties. Many suffer from bulimia.<br><br><strong>LEO</strong><br>FEAST OR FAMINE<br><br>Leos are hearty eaters, but they also like to have fine food - quality<br>means more than quantity. They like to make their meals a special occasion. What<br>makes a meal memorable for them is the presentation, the company, the wine<br>and the location. If Leos cook, they have a great sense of style and<br>presentation about it. Dinner parties at their homes can turn into a<br>performance, which is talked  about for a long time after.<br><br><strong>VIRGO</strong><br>SIMPLE'S BEST<br><br>Virgos are fussy eaters. They prefer to avoid the unknown and like to stick<br>with foods and spices they know well. The more basic, healthy and simple<br>their diet is, the better they feel towards it. They feel guilty(or even<br>suffer from nausea) if they eat fatty foods or desserts. simplicity is<br>their idea of dining perfection. More  vegetarians and health food fanatics are<br>born under this sign than any other.<br><br><strong>LIBRA</strong><br>PLEASURE SEEKER<br><br>As Librans are under the sign of the trend-marker, they are often into food<br>styles that are different or up-to-the-minute. Good cooks, they show their<br>originality and style by serving   sophisticated dishes. They can be<br>veritable health-food gourmets (baking their own breads etc). The same<br>applies to what they drink - it will be juices and herb teas (if their<br>inkling is towards health foods) or the best wines and French champagne.<br><br><strong>SCORPIO</strong><br>POWER EATER<br><br>As the sign of passion, intensity and desire, when Scorpios get into food,<br>they really get into it and overeat. The same attitude applies to a diet -<br>if they decide to diet, they do it well. This sign can have a desirous<br>nature all of its own - which no other sign can beat. They can be obsessive<br>about food preferences. If inviting a Scorpio for dinner,it's wise to<br>inquire in advance what they do or do not like to eat.<br><br><strong>SAGITTARIUS</strong><br>SECOND-HELPING QUEEN<br><br>When Sagittarians get hungry, they get super-hungry. Most are born loving<br>food and the total dining experience. They love the whole thing of sitting<br>around a table with a drink in one hand, a fork full of food in the other,<br>telling tales of their conquests or the things that have occurred during<br>the day. Dieting for Sagittarians can be hard. Removing them from food fun can<br>be like taking a duck away from water.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>
