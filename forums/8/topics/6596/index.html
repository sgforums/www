            <div class='col-md body'>Have u all ever ponder on the question that all this while we have been praying to the same god and there's actually only one god all this while. And just becos the ppl that were spreading the god's so-called religion have each spread their own way and thus causing there to be christians, taoism, islam....etc. Therefore that's why all religions have the same basic cause that is to teach the people to be good and not do evil. but because each religion is spread differently that's y there are different restrcitions and also different ways of praying. And as each religion is being passed down through lots of generation, more rules start to imply on each religion as there is a need for it as more and more people of different race/religion start to interact. well i'm not siding any religion here but just ask a question that really makes u think that whether it is the fault of the different religions or is it just because that people have spread it differently.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The idea that the different religions in existence today refer to just one God is known as religious pluralism.  This notion that all religions are true ignores important considerations.<br><br>First, while the major religions do share some common beliefs and values, fundamental and irreconcilable differences clearly divide them on crucially important issues. They disagree, for example on the nature of God, or of ultimate reality.  Some religions affirm monotheism (one god); others affirm polytheism (many Gods); still others affirm pantheism (all is God); some even affirm atheism (no God).  In Judaism and Islam, God is personal (singular); in Christianity, God is personal and more (a tri-unity); while in Hinduism and Buddhism, God is less than personal.  Some of the world's religious traditions view God as wholly transcendent, others as wholly immanent, and still others as both transcendent and immanent<br><br>Clearly the world's religions disagree on who or what God is, not to mention on other doctrines and the nature of salvation itself.<br><br>To counter this apparent contradiction against the existence of a single god, some philosophers of religion reason that religious pluralism is tenable if the contradictions among the world's religions are only apparent rather than real.  A way to illustrate this would be with the familiar elephant analogy: One blind man encountering an elephant for the first time compares it with a living pillar, another with a great snake, another with a plough-share, based on limited contact with the elephant's leg, trunk, and tusk, respectively<br><br>The argument is that man cannot possibly grasp the totality of the infinite God. Thus, since we lack an ultimate perspective, people may experience the same reality differently, because of their differing historical, cultural, or philosophical biases.<br><br>Yet, the above illustration does nothing to shore up this argument's weaknesses.  First, the elephant analogy implies a radical skepticism concerning knowledge of God; specifically, it says that no one (no religion) can know God satisfactorily. However, if God is largely unknowable, how are we able to know that he is unknowable?  For that matter, on what basis would we even know He exists?  Second, while the analogy attempts to validate the truth of all religions, it succeeds rather in showing that all religions fail to adequately identify and comprehend God.  In this case, the analogy demonstrates not that all religions are true but that all religions are largely false.<br><br>Hence, I would conclude that it is just not possible that the different religions are but different interpretations of a single Godhead.  The varying religions must refer to entirely different gods, and since only one God could have created the heavens and the earth; then there could only be one true religion.  Obviously, I have not addressed atheists Â– who believe that there is no God.  But that can wait for another thread.<br><br>Regards,<br>Paul Mah.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Paul Mah<br><br>But in all those cases, God is the creator, isn't it true?  All religions worship the creator being that also runs the course of life.  As for the case of atheism, I don't consider it to be religion.  Like religion it's a way of life, a believe, but religion implies that there is a god or three being worshipped.<br><br>As for the elephant analogy, the notion that all religions are "false" is not too bad or surprising after all.  Firstly, many of the holy texts were written long time ago.  How they are interpreted now largely depends on men and men make mistakes.  Secondly, men wrote and edit and compile those texts.  Same thing, men make mistakes, men may lie.<br><br>Another similarity of religion is that it offers a guidance to live life so that it doesn't seem to be in vain.  Moreover, religion teaches one to be a good person who can live with others, aren't the holy texts some rule books?<br>So what we have now are different people believing that they may reach a higher state of life if they do certain things prescribed by their respective religions.  Are they wrong?  If you stand outside and observe them it may look like they are silly for believing something which chance of being the right path is so low.  But if you flow with one of them and feel that it is indeed just another path to Rome, your life living with your religion is not in vain if you turn up to be a better person.<br><br>------------------<br>Easy is what men use to describe a woman who has the sexual values of a man.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MayaJade,<br><br>You misunderstood my last paragraph.  I was concluding that the argument for religious pluralism couldnÂ’t be valid.  Obviously, my reasoning assumes that God exist in the first place; not taking into consideration the beliefs of atheists, who state that there is no God.<br><br>I was not disputing the contribution that religion can bring to the society; neither was I justifying it.  Rather, all I did was to point out that it is not logically possible that the different religions refer to the same God, as was the original spirit of this thread.<br><br>Your points pertaining to the holy texts and religion being able to make one a better person can probably be said to be true of most religions.  Yet they are too generalized to be true of all religions.  To illustrate, many religions, for example Christianity and Islam believe that only their followers will go to heaven.  Specifically, that there is only one road to Rome in these cases.  Further to that, the worshipping of Satan, or Satanism for example, does nothing to make oneself a better person.<br><br>Errors in the holy texts might hold true for other religions, but is certainly not true of the Bible.  I can elaborate on that if necessary, but my point is simply that whilst your contention for religion bringing about good is generally true, it is incorrect to assume that it is universally accurate.<br><br>Regards,<br>Paul Mah.<br><br>[This message has been edited by PaulMah (edited 20 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Paul Mah:<br><br>i would choose to disagree with ur point that different religion have different Gods. For that matter, the study of mythology shows that events happening in different era and geography have a tendency to be similiar in context. Take for example the biblical story of Noah and the big flood, there exist similiar stories in Sumerian text as well as ancient Chinese text. While no linkage can be conclusively found, there exist a possibility that it might be a actual account (the great flood as accorded by the bible) or that the story was being disseminated vertically and horizontally.<br>Based on this reasoning, might it not be possible that the various religions sprouting up throught the ages might be in one form or another linked to one another?<br>Take for example the religion Islam. While i profess to know only the basics of this religion, i do know that Mohammed, the founder of this religion, has some knowledge of Christianity and that he even mentioned about Abraham in one of his visions.(1)Would it be too far fetched to suggest that his God might be the same God that those Christians have been preaching in the region for years.<br><br>Another example i can think of is Judaism and Christianity, is it not true that both of them worship the same God?? Is not the founder of Christianity,Jesus Christ, himself a Jew. Can we denied that the God he's preaching about is the one his parents have been worshipping for ages?<br><br>To quote: Errors in the holy texts might hold true for other religions, but is certainly not true of the Bible.<br><br>Can u substain ur claims that the Bible's error proof? Most religious groups regard their sacred text as near-holy objects and that any doubts about their authencity are usually treated as sacrilegious. How can we conduct a proper study of all their content in a academic light with all these self mechanism acting up among these advocates?? While i might not have enough research materials to substain my arguments that the Bible is NOT error proof, absence of proof does not means proof of absence.<br><br>Mr Hata-san<br><br>(1) I do not profess to know the whole story, any enlightenment on this subject and correction is welcomed.<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim<br><br>[This message has been edited by Mr Hata-san (edited 22 March 2000).]</div>
