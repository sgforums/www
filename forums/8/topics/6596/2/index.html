            <div class='col-md body'>Does it matter if we have a God or not? Sometimes, I wonder what's a holy war? How can a war be holy when it involves such bloodshed.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>MayaJade</strong>:<br><br>errrrmmm....<br>aren't you trying to say antagonist (the bad guy) instead of protagonist (the good guy)?<br><br><strong>Lonewolfe</strong>:<br><br>The holy wars happened because of the human errors (as pointed out by MayaJade) made by the people who made the wars come about. For the holy wars in the middle ages (when the Christians from Europe tried to take over the Holy Land) the main driving force behind this war was not the protection of the Holy Land (as a lot of the soldiers and Knights believed), but greed in the Church at that time, or to be more exact, in <strong>the people</strong> who run the Church at that time.<br><br>I agree with you that this fighting between religions is such a sad happening, and I believe that is what John Lennon meant when he said "and no religion, too".<br><br><strong>Mr. Hata-San</strong>:<br><br>Well...<br>from <span style="font-style: italic;">my own observation</span>, it seems that Islam, Protestanism, Catholicism and Orthodoxy was based on Christianity in one way or another, which was in turn based on Judaism. (Note how I separated Protestanism, Catholicism and Orthodoxy. Also note that Protestanism includes Anglican churches, Lutheran churches, etc.)<br><br>The split of Christianity into these 4 branches (Islam, Protestanism, Catholicism and Orthodoxy) are again, as MayaJade pointed out, the results of differences in interpretation. All those founders of religions are, after all, human.<br><br>Catholicism I would think is the one that has its roots closer to Christianity (ie. the founding church started off by Jesus Christ), if only because it has the longest history as compared to the others. Again, this is <strong>only</strong> based on my own observations, which are, I believe, less than inadequate. After all, I'm only human.<br><br>It is also true that a lot of the things that happened in religious texts has been proven to be true. For example, the story of Noah and the Ark has been repeated countless of times in various religious texts and mythologies. Even more interesting is the fact that it has been proven geographically and archeologically that there <strong>was</strong> indeed a great flood that swept the Middle East around the approximate time that Noah, and his counterparts in other religious texts and mythologies, was believed to have lived. (I will try to look up some websites for this). And even <strong>more</strong> interesting is the fact that archeologists has also found what people like to believe is the remnants of the Ark itself. (will also try to look this up).<br><br>So is there truth in religious texts? I believe there might, to some extent. Especially given some of the archeological evidence unearthed around the Middle East. (I'm sure most of you has already heard of the Shroud of Turin)<br><br><strong>To All</strong>:<br><br>The matter of the existence of God/how many gods are there/which one is the true religion has always been, still is and I think will always be a problem that will remain unresolved until we eventually die.<br><br>Here's how <a href="http://www.m-w.com" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-style: italic;">Merriam-Webster</span></a> defined religion:<br><br><blockquote><br>1 a : the state of a religious &lt;a nun in her 20th year of religion&gt; b (1) : the service and worship of God or the supernatural (2) : commitment or devotion to religious faith or observance<br>2 : a personal set or institutionalized system of religious attitudes, beliefs, and practices<br>3 archaic : scrupulous conformity : CONSCIENTIOUSNESS<br>4 : a cause, principle, or system of beliefs held to with ardor and faith<br></blockquote>I believe we are all agreed that the basis of most, if not all, religions is not merely the worship and service of God/gods and the supernatural, in fact, it is a set of fundamental principles aimed to bring about good in this world, starting from the individual. Sometimes, it is even a <strong>personal</strong> set of beliefs (which might <span style="font-style: italic;">just</span> put atheism in the category of religions).<br><br>So in the end, any religion is just another human institution, created by their respective founders with the purpose of bettering the human race. We do not really care whether or not they (the founders) are who/what they claim to be, or whether there is only one god or many gods; as long as what the religion you believe in teaches does not go against your own conscience, then it doesn't really matter.<br><br>P.S. <strong>DISCLAIMER</strong>:<br><br>I tried my best not to piss anybody off writing this post, since we all know how sensitive an issue religion is, so if you feel offended, please let me know nicely, and not flame me, ok? it's not very nice    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Two roads branched in a wood,<br>and I,<br>I took the one less travelled by.<br>And that has made all the difference</span><br>-- Robert Frost<br><br>[This message has been edited by LiQuid!
