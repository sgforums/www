            <div class='col-md body'>It is the upbringing. The parents are more lenient.<br>I know of this boy who didn't attend  sch. even when the teacher called his home. The next day, he brought his mum to sch. to lecture the teacher.<br>The mum sided with him &amp; said the son rather self study at home.<br><br>The kids are more vocal &amp; daring. They will openly defy &amp; criticise the teachers, knowing that the teachers will get into trouble if they hit them.<br>Parents have problem with their teenage kids now cos they pamper them when they are young. Now they lost control of them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Its hard to control kids and expect them to be what we were, to be obedient and respectful.<br>I see my own brother and his kid whom he treats like a princess where she will spoil things and rip things apart but neve get any punishment or even a lecture. The father simply let her do what she wants and claims she is very smart and understands many things. She has spoilt computers, remotes, anything and everything. She's just 1 year old and she knows how to play my family members and make up lies claiming people make her cry or injure her when she fall on her own. Then the adults will quarrel over her and then she will start crying and asking for more "love". Then my brother treats my folks quite poorly and my niece learn that and she used to take things and hit us adults. She already learn to keep things for herself and refused to share. She will pick up money, gold chains, even clothes or costume jewellery that we wear and she would paw it, try to pull it off (imagine how painful) and keep it. When she wants a toy, she will stop at nothing to get it. So my brother will keep buying her stuff even at one point he was unemployed for months. He pays only for her food, the rest of it, my 70 yr old parents (still had to go out working) pay other bills. She cannot be taught things or she will cry or yell and then her father will come and frown on all of us that we "ill treat" his daughter - not even stop her from banging herself and getting injured, she will claim we beat her. We cannot even bring her out cause she beats up other kids, she will pull down shop shelves and she stuffs her face at every opportunity she gets. She's a spoilt brat and really my parents who takes care of her cannot stand her and has found no way to teach her. And no one dare to cane her in case the father sees the welts and we all end up in another quarrel. So my folks who lived with him are very unhappy, and my father after some stupid quarrel wanted to move out like me.<br><br>To me, this is the kind of kid that kid will be the future adults. I see very grim future. But really, I don't care. And I can only take care of myself ... till I expire... maybe sooner too. ..<br><br></div>

My mom cooks and clean after her, feed the kid but she claims she's overworked and needed a maid. Then she fed lies to different individuals in the household to create tension and quarrels. Now she wants the kid back after she left overnight and abandoned her. We found out she lock up the kid of months when she gone back to taiwan while she herself goes out with friends. Her own mother fell sick taking care of my niece. But I see the same characteristics in this niece as her mother. That kind of smart, can please save it for some rich family. My family is poor and made poorer by this kind of conflct and kid. This kid brought nothing but pain and worry for my household.<br></div>
