            <div class='col-md body'>Just read in the papers today..that someone who is in the same situation as Andrea..about the liver transplant.<br>However, it seems that no one in her family is a suitable donor and that she will die in a week time if she did not get a donor..a monk offered to donate part of his liver to her but this is what was abstracted from the straits times<br><br>[QUOTE]<strong>She may not live out the week if she does not get a transplant soon.<br><br>The 43-year-old logistics executive was admitted to NUH on May 11.<br><br>She suffered liver toxicity which led to liver failure, after taking the China-made Slim 10.<br><br>It contained fenfluramine, a banned substance associated with heart-valve and thyroid problems and, now, hepatitis.<br><br>Her cousin, who wanted to be known only as Jason, said she came down with pneumonia on Tuesday night because her immune system was down.<br><br>'Her condition went downhill from there.'<br><br>He added: 'None of us in the family has had much sleep lately. It's been nothing but torment.'<br><br>Meanwhile, more than 200 people have approached the hospital offering help.<br><br>Some even volunteered to donate their livers.<br><br>Venerable Omalpe Sobhita Thero, a 52-year-old Buddhist monk, turned up at the hospital yesterday to offer his liver.<br><br>But as he is a stranger and transplants from living unrelated donors are not allowed at the moment, he was not tested to see if his liver was compatible.<br><br></strong>[QUOTE]<br>as far as i know..she is in the same situation what Andrea..so why the double standard in the Laws of singapore in these days..just because she is Andrea De Cruz means that she can have special treatment and the Laws can bend just for her?<br><br>really feel sad for the patient..just because she is not popular..she won't get a second chance.......<br>any comments??<br>or anyone would like to enlightment me with regards to this issue??<br><br></div>
