            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, I studied in the US and then stayed here for work for many years. It takes a little getting used to, especially the lack of orderliness and cleanliness.  Cities are dirty here. The most interesting thing to me was the gap between rich and poor.  One block is nice and then down another block is the ghettos.<br><br>You do get to have fun here though, there is just so much to do, from sports to entertainment and meeting people from all over the world, not just 'ang mos,' especially in college. I learned a lot just by experiencing different views and perspectives projected by different cultures. I learned to look at issues and challenges differently and broadly; a worldly view, which helps me a great deal in life.<br><br>I learned to question everything and I believed that is why Americans are viewed as loud mouthed and arrogant. Americans do argue just about everything. I couldnÂ’t believe they do it on TV, radio, print; so many programs and articles just debating, analyzing or criticizing politics, social issues and current events. Just about everyone has an opinion on anything, since it is in AmericansÂ’ nature to question everything, especially its leaders. After all, it is the foundation on which this country is built. And I think that is why Americans come across as arrogant and loud.<br><br>Freedom is not as great as I thought it would be, sure I can protest, question the government, even run a porn business if I want, but I pay for that freedom by having to tolerate the freedom of others doing things I disagree with. If there is one thing I took for granted back in Singapore, it is the semi-homogenized society where most people around me were of the same race, social class, attitude and the like. It takes a while to adjust when everyone elseÂ’s culture, attitude and thinking are very different and even crontradicting to mine. It is a positive thing though.<br><br>So why do I stay here? I feel that that creative people are more respected and rewarded in this country. And no, I am not a aspiring songwriter, artist, or performer. If you think that, then maybe thatÂ’s just the problem. Here, creativity applies to everything, whether you are at a desk job, field job or just doing anything else. I have been greatly rewarded and respected for my ideas everywhere in this country. Now I run my own business and get so much support from business leaders and even CEOs who give me the time of their day to mentor and guide me along the way. I would probably only get that kind of support and mentorship in Singapore if I was starting a technology company.<br><br>There is just so much creative energy and opportunities here to be successfu and live a fuller life. Start a video game company, a food and beverage company,  become a pro skater, cut an album, help the poor, start a non-profit, whatever.  What impresses me the most is that many Americans donÂ’t measure success by the 5Cs, some are content with spirituality, some are just happy to be starving artists, some are happy just as long as their family is happy. Success and happiness is attained and measured here in many ways besides just a huge bank account. Maybe thatÂ’s why I stay, if my business fails, I can try again or just pursue the many various standards of success here.</div>
