These IDIOTS i see, trying to put other people down, so that they can step on them to bring up their own life.<br>Seems like these low lifes, have not grown any brains to think, nor eyes to see, But they only have ears to listen to Gossips and a "gab" to slander and malice other people. (If these ppl actually develop brains to think, they won't actually reply to this thread)<br><br>Seems like these people say all that they want, without going through their non-existance brain. YET STILL dare to say what contented being "Gifted", hahahha, makes me want to laugh my head off. IQ tested without any test, hahhahaha how crappy can these people get.......<br>hahaha, my goodness, this is SOooo amusing.<br><br>Some of these people being unhappy bout other people's life, so they got to poke their noses into other ppl's life. And try to convince other people into believing thing which are not true, ooooooohhhhh.<br>These are true evil being, yet still try to pretend to be holy by quote a bit of scriptures. Dun play play, can quote scriptures leh........<br>Later she put the whole bible, new and old testaments into her Signature, see how we all die. HAHAHHAAHAHAHAHahahahahahaaaa.......<br><br>Others being just plain JEALOUS, POSSESSIVE, about other things that USED to belong to them. So must take it out in this place.<br><br>ONE more, those who fire till Buay Ge Yan, use another nick to come fire again. Hahahahha Just how lame can these losers get.....<br><br>Just what might happen if we turn the story the other way round to make these people the target board?<br>Will they still be so Gracious to let things down?!?!?!?!<br><br>Only time will tell........<br>let me just sit back and take a good look......    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>hahhahaaa </blockquote>i get tired so very easily and i don't like scrolling past long signatures, so i'll reply using the new topic feature, okay?<br><br>and btw, those with long signatures, i don't want your opinions, so if you feel the urge, kindly keep it in check, i appreciate it very much, thank you.<br><br>this gifted self-absorbed idiot saw the words Â“IQ tested without any testÂ” and immediately jumped to the conclusion that you must have meant me in one of the people you meant. sorry hor but i think i wrote Â“IQ tested without any prior testÂ”, oops, i forgot that maybe with ??? intelligence, you didnÂ’t know i meant that unlike kiasu people these days who buy books and do IQ questions to prepare prior to sitting one set by MENSA, i did no such thing.<br><br>hang on, oops actually i did have a prior test, a mock test by MENSA, darn i did so well (full score) in that mock test in so short a time that i grew very cocky and did the real test in my own sweet time, thereby resulting in not being able to finish it, but no matter, my IQ score was 132, 16 points short of genius calibre, MENSA regretfully informed me in the letter of rejection to the Society   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> and that i belong to the other 98 percentile of the population, it was the word Â“otherÂ” that rattled, not that i wasnÂ’t a genius, elitist group, isnÂ’t it? in recent newspaper reports, it said that people with such IQ are considered gifted and i'm happy with that as long as it's within normal range. erm, are you going to dispute with MENSA? anyway, IQ is but a number, iÂ’m sure your IQ is much higher than mine.<br><br>and i resent the implication that i listen to gossips to slander other people, it so not true. iÂ’m old enough to hold my own opinions and i flame FireIce out of my own free will, although that will is sometimes helping others. and reverse psychological insults about actually having a brain and not replying to your thread doesnÂ’t work with me, i was trained by the best in reverse psychology and hey i employ it several times in my flamings, please try some other tactics which may perhaps work? like using your time productively to persuade FireIce to behave with decorum and stop gloating like a paranoid bitch as she claims? and maybe if you know Jason, get him to do something about favouritism, nepotism and long signatures too? thank you.<br><br>[This message has been edited by colette (edited 16 November 2000).]</div>
