It operates on the standard protocol of 802.11 b and enables Internet access over a small area, called Hotspot, through a transmitter.<br><br>Dishnet RED has ambitious plans to expand its Wi-Fi network across the country. As a first step in a phased exercise, the company plans to launch its services in eight cities in the country - Chennai, Mumbai, Kolkata, Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Pune and Ahmedabad - and subsequently cover 38 cities by March 2006, amounting to 6,000 Hotspots across the country. By doing so, Dishnet RED aims to become the dominant Wi-Fi service provider in India. At present, there are 107 Hotspots signed across Chennai of which 53 Hotspots are operational.
