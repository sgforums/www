            <div class='col-md body'><strong>I was born in Sinkapore, a peaceful and prosperous country of great beauty.. Visitors have often commented on the cleanliness and orderliness of the city, the way everything works miraculously like a well-oiled machine...<br><br>However, one of the compromises we had to make for our high standard of living is that we have to give up many of our freedoms... We do not have freedom of press, freedom of association and freedom of speech..<br><br>We live under a one-party dictatorship, albeit a benevolent one... However, benevolence could be suffocating, especially if you could be thrown into jail without trial for expressing a dissenting opinion ...<br><br>Being a small country, we need talented people.. and that's the reason why we welcome them with open arms, albeit at the expense of local sinkaporean... in order to retain those FT and keep them, we need to create a city full of life..<br><br>Thats why, we make it a place where you not only work, but get entertain as well.. weekends can be spent partying, with most disco open till 5am.. we also legalised bar-top dancing , to show sinkapore is not a conservative society..<br><br>What's unique about sinkapore is that we get our drinking water from newater.. its safe and out of this world.. We get to live in pigeon-holes, which cost little to built.. another great concept of living by our forefather...with ERP gantries in place, traffic-jam will not be a problem..</strong></div>
