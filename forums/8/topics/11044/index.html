And she's just giving up what we have built up over the past 6 yrs just like that? Sigh...it's been 3 months now...and I still can't get over it... How can that be? She says that she doesn't have anyone else... I've tried all I can to win her back...but failed miserably...sigh...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm sorry to hear abt your predicament but face the facts. When a girl says she wants to be alone she means she doesn't love you anymore. Girls are never direct when it comes to such things ... they'll find all types of excuses to breakup without looking bad. Short of abusing her ... a girl will seldom breakup unless she got some other guy she's interested in. Face it she's lied to you.<br><br>You have 2 choices:<br><br>1) You can grovel like a dog, make a total fool of yourself &amp; lose all dignity or;<br><br>2) Be a man &amp; act cool about it. Show as if you don't give a damn ... or at least act that way.<br><br>By groveling, you make yourself look weak. Furthermore how can she miss you if you're constantly in her face ... begging for her to take you back. I rate your chances as 0 if you start to grovel &amp; beg<br><br>Act cool ... totally bo chup her ... don't call, don't e-mail, don't icq ... don't anything. Show her that you can live without her. Go out with other girls ... preferably to places where you'll know she'll be. Seeing you having such a fun time without her will make her jealous. Don't show too much willingness to talk or help her out with anything. If she has any feelings for you left ... she can't help but wonder whether she has lost something good. The more you bo chup her ... the more she will think of you. So which of the 2 choices do you think has a better chance of succeeding!</div>
