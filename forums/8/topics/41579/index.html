            <div class='col-md body'>just now abit boliao, so go and play minesweeper, then playing halfway i remembered back when at 1st i didn't even know how to play the game at all, then got 1 time i go my fren house, see him play.. then he taught me how to play, dunno why after that i got damn addicted to the game till the point that i could finish expert mode in 96 seconds... now cannot liao lah, play for over half an hour liaoz, intermediate 56 secs, expert haven't cross yet, at the final point keep on dying...<br><br>anyway.... 1 of his lessons that he taught me was when u 1st click on a spot, the area that opens up must be big, as big as possible, if it's small, start over again, dun even bother continuing, coz the chances of dying (esp when playing expert mode) is very high.<br><br>the difference between me and him is that, even if i open a small area only, i would continue playing instead of restarting, coz i felt that as long as there's still this glimmer of hope, i should still keep trying and not quit until i finally die.<br><br>and i realized that how we come to these 2 very insignificant yet very real reasons is the things we come to expect in life, as well as how we face them - for me, i'm willing to try to succeed, no matter how slim the chances are, yet for my friend, he isn't even willing to take the risk, unless he is very sure of 'winning'.<br><br>this is also sort reflects our real life now.<br><br>few years ago, during our O levels, i went the poly route, while he went the JC route. his grades weren't exactly awesome, sure enough, he got into a jc, actually he was eligible to get into nanyang jc arts, but as usual, he only wanted the best, so he settled for serangoon jc science. he felt that after jc he could get into U and that would secure him a better future, he had no particular dream job or ambition, just the standard singapore "good pay, stablility, enuff to survive and live slightly comfortably". i went poly because basically i was just sick of mugging. i just wanted to study another 3 more yrs then just get ou there and work, i wanted money, considering my circumstances then (and even now), money was everything.<br><br>to cut it short (i had typed a really long thingy, then i realised i was rambling, so i deleted it.) he couldn't get into neither NUS nor NTU, not sure about SIM or SMU, maybe he thinks they aren't good enough. last i heard, he was aiming for UOL or something.<br><br>me, i couldn't study, had no interest in engineering. it was like a deadend route, everyday was a routine to me, i felt as though i was living my fren's dream lifestyle instead of my own. and then, i saw a glimmer of hope. i decided to quit and just start over from scratch at another school, this time in a line that i would have interest in. after 6 long years of running around, i wouldn't say that i'm 'successful' yet, at least not at this point of time, but i still feel that i'm already halfway there. i'm doing something i like, learned something i want, and am actually even going into my own business (if freelance is conidered a business <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">). compared to my fren, whose in a state of limbo right now, i would say that taking that unworthy risk paid off well.<br><br>and this just reflects the basic mentality of most singaporeans i know. unwilling to take risks. i'm not saying that everyone will turn out happy, but at least, mai so hum chee lah, try abit will die meh?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
