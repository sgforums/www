My family members who are in the same age range are all very nice to me, but outside of that I've never seen any old people who is good. Also you seem to be experienced in circumstances of people dealing with stress, so maybe you can become a psychologist. If ppl got more worth than me, than they get treated better, I dont mind. and worth is not easily defined of course, if you know someone, you will see if he is worthy or not, based on many aspects, not just one thing. thats the way I see things, I never asked people to be tolerate of my views because if you dont tolerate me, go F yourself k(jkjk). As for that old man, clearly he has no worth, because nothing happened to him, I apologized and yet he acted like a jerk. anyone who acts like that should get run over by a car...(argh!!! anger overload again!!! just dont give me another essay)</div>

My family members who are in the same age range are all very nice to me, but outside of that I've never seen any old people who is good. Also you seem to be experienced in circumstances of people dealing with stress, so maybe you can become a psychologist. If ppl got more worth than me, than they get treated better, I dont mind. and worth is not easily defined of course, if you know someone, you will see if he is worthy or not, based on many aspects, not just one thing. thats the way I see things, I never asked people to be tolerate of my views because if you dont tolerate me, go F yourself k(jkjk). As for that old man, clearly he has no worth, because nothing happened to him, I apologized and yet he acted like a jerk. anyone who acts like that should get run over by a car...(argh!!! anger overload again!!! just dont give me another essay)</div></blockquote>hm ok. i guess u r more expressive. in a way tts good cos at least u dun suffer from emotional overload. haha... and u seem like a passive-aggressive sort. and btw i din get a1 for my english.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>as for becoming a psychologist, i thought about it when i was deciding wat to do in the U, but eventually din. but now, i am reading up on counselling. so perhaps tts y.<br><br>ur english isnt bad either and so is ur essay writing! but mabbe can haf more paragraphing to make for easier read.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
