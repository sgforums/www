            <div class='col-md body'><br>I have 2 kids and they brought lots of joy to the family. I know kids are important to me. They are great inspirational forces to both me and my wife to our otherwise monotonous life. They created a more balanced life, they made up for a complete family, they bring in the ups and downs of life, they showed me how I needed to improve myself so that I can teach them, they make do good things so that I am right model for them, they make my life very busy but with a purpose, they make me open up my emotions which I always hide in front of the adults, ...<br><br>I simply love kids and wouldn't gave them away for even a billion dollars. With my 2 little children, even the very simple things in life can bring tons of joy. I don't need tons of money to get happiness. I also realise kids don't need tons of money to excel because parents are the best teachers for kids.<br><br>Just like many good thing in life, u need to put in lots of right effort to nurture great kids. And kids being something which you cannot simply throw away or easily give up halfway, will surely bring the best out of you and will take almost all your free time away especially in the early ages of a child.<br><br>Yet for all those good experiences and even if you are mentally, financially and  physically prepared, I would advise that you consider carefully about having a child. Climate change is something I believe in and which is something I feel will happen in our lifetime. I also look at it very pessimistically. So much so, that my wife and I have decided not to have anymore children.<br><br>cheers<br><br></div>

In fact, I also hear the same thing from my overseas colleague in Shanghai, India, etc...<br><br>But I've seen so many cases where parents who are not rich yet are still able to make end needs. I have an eldest brother with very low education level but have 4 children, he worked very hard at the food stall and have never once went for a tour since his marriage. I've often advise him to take a break since the fruit of his hardwork, after so many years, has at last brought him a stable income but he has yet heeded my advise. The tour was secondary to him. His children was his primary. They are his source of motivation, his source of courage, his source to move on and of course his source of happiness and sadness. He wouldn't have succeeded if he didn't have his children and wife to motivate and inspire and he wouldn't have felt more fullfilled and confident if he didn't have this family.<br><br>Committed parents can tell you so much of the successful stories and the goodness of children but you have empathise us to deeply feel our perception. Having a family requires a paradigm shift. It shifts away from thoughts of selfishness towards thoughts of selflessness. When you are able to do this, you will surely be a great mother even with very little money.<br><br>When people tell me they don't to have children, I also always wonder if they have ever thought what they are going to do with so many years of life ahead. Even at 30 yrs old, we are not even halfway through our life!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's definietly great having kids around as they bring joy to your life but I would not encourage you to have kids here for all the obvious reasons. Best thing you can do for your kids is give them an environment elsewhere...<br><br>Many of us have already left this place with no regrets and we are encouraging more to join us. No point bringing up your kids here. In fact, many of our friends have gone to north america just to give birth to their kids so that they will be treated as a citizen there. Do the right thing for your kids, migrate.</div>
