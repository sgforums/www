            <div class='col-md body'>I used to be a teacher, and looking at my students struggling with the S'porean education system, i am quite hesitant to have a kid myself.<br><br>Now the education system is more stressful and competitive than ever. Not only do kids have to excel academically, they have to excel in their character, leadership abilities, ability to think on their feet, resilience, social and emotional skills, aesthetics appreciation, physical fitness, etc etc etc they are basically assessed on everything. The exam papers are much tougher than they used to be. And worse of all, all this --&gt; and no guarantee of a good job in future.<br><br>I'm new to this forum, so I'm not sure if someone else has posted this. But anyway, hope to see a few replies. What do you all think?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hahahah ArdusKane.... that video is really funny.<br><br>I'm not exactly against having children. I've seen happy and well-brought up children (though these are few and far between) .  This question just came to my mind after reading the papers about S'pore being on 'razor edge' - thinking of how govt always tells us how we need to maintain our competitive edge to survive, as we have no resources, etc.  Sure, every country has its problems (and ours is low birth rate -how ironic). Was also reading about global warming -the earth could be in a really bad shape in 50 years' time.<br><br>So, was thinking if it's a good idea to bring a kid into this world with all these problems?<br><br>And what if the kid doesn't take care of you when you are old and dumps u in an old folks home instead?<br><br>Is the joy that the kids bring you worth all the money and effort spent?<br><br></div>

If you believe that to be the case, then you're better off "playing safe" and not have a child.<br><br>Just to put things in perspective : in many Western societies, parents raise their children without any expectation of obligations of any sort from their children. In the US, many parents look forward to seeing their children "go to college" (which, for most, signals the end of the journey where parents are responsible for most of the child's financial burdens) and all they expect in return is for their grown-up children to raise their next generation...<br><br>In essence, life is what you make of it - if you want your children to render your investments worthwhile, then make sure you inculcate such values from young. Then again, everything in life is a gamble - there're no guarantees, are there?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </blockquote>i totally agree with your views  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>asian culture has set the idea that people bring up kids as 'insurance' for their old age.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>
