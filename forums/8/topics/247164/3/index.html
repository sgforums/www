            <div class='col-md body'>To FireAndHell,<br><br>I seldom hear regrets of parents having children. I have talked to so many parents in my workplace and rarely do I see them saying they regret having children.<br><br>The few cases that I hear parents saying they regret bringing their child to this world are those that are gone terribly wrong. Like those born handicap or those who commit serious crimes or those shot gun cases.<br><br>Nonetheless, there are indeed sad cases. After hearing and understanding so much of what a child brings (the bad and the good), the decision is still onto ourselves "Am I and my partner ready to commit?"</div>
