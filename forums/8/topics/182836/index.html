They think that they are as good as F1 racers and try to drive very fast, thinking that they are cool and skillful. Too bad, they are not even close to even be qualified to race in any circuit. Good for them to dream and imagine that they are great racers.</div></blockquote>Not only F1, many got inspired by how Jay Chou drives in the movie Initial D, and many started to drive with 1 hand, thinking its so cool.
