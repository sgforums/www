Company says:<br>Money used for research, conservation<br>THE Singapore Zoo and Night Safari have made millions of dollars in profits over the past three years, according to their financial records.<br>By Teh Jen Lee<br><br>13 September 2007<br>THE Singapore Zoo and Night Safari have made millions of dollars in profits over the past three years, according to their financial records.<br><br>They also receive grants from the Government and sponsorship money from private corporations.<br><br>Adoptions and donations totalled $1.5 million for their parent company's last financial year ended 31 Mar.<br><br>So why does parent company Wildlife Reserves Singapore (WRS) still accept funds from a charity for research and the care of its animals?<br><br>Some people asked this question when the Wildlife Conservation Singapore Fund (WCSF), a registered charity, held its flag day last month.<br><br>Information slips given to canvassers stated that the collections will be used to fund studies on wildlife in their natural habitats and to 'care for and propagate' animals within the zoo and the Night Safari.<br><br>The two attractions part of the Singapore Zoological Gardens (SZG), a private limited company.<br><br>Donors like botanist Joseph Lai wondered why public money was needed for this when its parent company is making millions in profits.<br><br>Mr Lai, 48, said he donated only 20 cents when he was approached.<br><br>He was not pleased when he found out the money is channelled to the zoo by the charity.<br><br>Although the amount he donated is small, he felt private companies should not be getting money through the fund.<br><br>The zoo was deemed a charity until 2004 when this status was transferred to a fund that was renamed WCSF last year.<br><br>Mr Lai told The New Paper: 'When donations are being canvassed in public places, people donate in faith that there is governance to ensure fair and equitable distribution of funds to legitimate causes with the most urgent needs.<br><br>'Profit-making businesses should have no place within this public donation system to ask for any monetary help.'<br><br>It costs an adult $16.50 to visit the zoo and $22 to visit the Night Safari.<br><br>The 2006/07 yearbook of WRS, which runs SZG and Jurong Bird Park, shows admissions as the biggest revenue earner - generating $33.4million, or 44 per cent of total revenue in financial year 2006/07.<br><br>Net profit after tax for that year was $17 million, while the year before was $14 million. In 2004/05, the first year that WRS made a profit, the figure was $12 million.<br><br>Yet, the fund said it gave $1.1million to the zoo last year. The money was donated by the public and by corporations for specific adoptions of animals and exhibits there.<br><br>KEY QUESTION<br><br>One key question: Aren't the company's profits sufficient to cover animal-related expenses?<br><br>After all, animal feed and vet expenses came to only $2.1 million - 3per cent of WRS' total expenses.<br><br>The zoo's executive director, Ms Fanny Lai, said profits go towards covering operating costs, which includes the cost of upgrading animal habitats in the zoo, as well as funding of research projects overseas.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Do all of the company's profits go back towards operating costs that are directly related to the animals and towards research?<br><br>Ms Lai did not answer this directly</span>.</span> She said: 'Profits have been retained as sinking fund for the redevelopment, upgrading and expansion of SZG.'<br><br>But since it's profitable, can the zoo be fully self-funding and take care of research as well?<br><br>Ms Lai said the zoo relies on operating cash flow, government grants and public donations for its ongoing operations.<br><br>She said: 'Apart from the government grant and public donations, corporate sponsorships are also critical to the future welfare of endangered species.<br><br>'Conservation is a necessary endeavour and to give the animals an environment akin to their habitat, research on the endangered species has to be ongoing. Without donations and sponsorships, such research will be inhibited.'<br><br>Still, some canvassers, such as university student Zhang Yuzhuo, wondered about the need for the flag day.<br><br>Miss Zhang, 18, and her friends spent four hours at Tiong Bahru Plaza as part of a compulsory school-based community involvement programme.<br><br>She said in Mandarin: 'It's not like we were raising funds for disaster victims where the need is more obvious. I also felt that it was not necessary to give away such fancy stickers.'<br><br>This is the second year that WCSF is having a flag day. Last year, it collected slightly more than $36,000.<br><br>This year's figures are still being verified.<br><br>A check by The New Paper showed there are non-profit zoos that receive charity money while charging entrance fees, such as the San Diego Zoo, the Berlin Zoo and Sydney's Taronga Zoo.<br><br>Taronga Zoo receives funds from the Association of Zoo Friends (New South Wales), an independent charity, but any extra revenue generated goes back to animal-related expenses.<br></div>
