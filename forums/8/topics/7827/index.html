            <div class='col-md body'>I am sure we all have been through this experience before . I just wonder what purpose do exams really serve . The stress , the agony , the lack of sleep etc. Somehow the quality of our education seems to be defined by the grades we get . Can an entire year's work be defined by just a few hours spent in the examination hall ? During exams there are always 2 group of people who make me nervous .<br><br>There always seem to be a bunch of people who always seem to breeze through exams without breaking a single sweat while mere mortals like us have to struggle just to keep up .<br><br>Another group of people are the muggertoads who keep doing the same questions over and over again without really understanding . It is people like them who defeat the purpose of having exams which in my opinion is to test our understanding of the subject and not how much facts we can memorise.<br><br>Well I wonder what other people's opinions are  about the topic.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The purpose of exams is to evaluate the student performance and understanding of the subject. I feel that exams are totally necessary to judge our ability. If there were no exams, how would you judge a person ability? Exams do not take up the entire weightage. There are also projects, practicals and class tests. Of course exams take up a huge percentage(60% for my case) as they are more important compare to practicals and class tests. But that doesnÂ’t mean that practicals and class tests arenÂ’t important. They are vital to your overall grade. I believe that as long as you maintain a consistent effort in your schoolwork, you wouldnÂ’t face so much stress when you are preparing for your exams.<br><br><blockquote>Another group of people are the muggertoads who keep doing the same questions over and over again without really understanding . It is people like them who defeat the purpose of having exams which in my opinion is to test our understanding of the subject and not how much facts we can memorise.</blockquote>I observed that many a times a student doing the same kind of questions are in a situation where they claim that they do not have enough time for revision. Some true some might not be true. While in another case, a student might find that questions on certain type of topic is easy and could score more marks, well they have absolute reason to do that question. I agreed with both hands up that the purpose of exams is not based on how much facts we can memorise.<br><br>------------------<br>If you bring forth what is inside you,<br>what you bring forth will save you.<br>If you do not bring forth what is inside you,<br>what you do not bring forth will destroy you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If there are no exams, would we bother to study? I prob won't be bothered to read all those stuff that would make me fall asleep.<br><br>Right now, my faculty is starting to place less emphasis on exams..sometimes the weightage of the exams is only 40%, with the remaining being taken up by indiv projects, group projects, assignments, midterm tests, and even class participation. But, no matter how much we students hate them, exams are still necessary to ensure that we have at least a certain level of understanding of the subject.  There are always free-riders in group projects, and even in indiv projects, we would still discuss among ourselves and everybody would have similar answers. Thus, exams is the best way to test each and every individual based on their own ability.<br><br>And to counter the problem of students who merely memorise rather than understand the materials, we have a number of open-book exams. I like open-book exams because that means that I do not have to remember facts and can spend my time to fully understand the stuff that i'm reading. But on the other hand, I hate open-book exams coz they are really tough and they really test how much you understand a certain topic, how well you can apply what you have learnt to a new case or scenario.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>(to qwerty and revelations, happy studying  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think the reason we dread exams so much is cos we've been brought up to answer exam questions in a certain way, i.e., cramming as much info as we can within the time permitted. and teachers have been trained to expect these kinds of answers too. but the way to pick a good essay from a bad one is not necessarily based on how much information and material one has crammed into one's answers. often what is impt is whether the student has actually answered a question. this may sound obvious but there are actually several ways of answering (or not answering) a question.<br><br>those who don't know what on earth they are doing, write everything down (C grade staring you in the face here), and expect the marker to sift out the relevant from irrelevant material. many s'poreans do this. then there are those who answer the question briefly, perhaps too briefly, and do not appreciate the complexities of the problem (these ppl can actually get Bs, so if you see ppl walking out of the exam hall early and still getting Bs, they are prob busy answering the question instead of writing a whole lot of irrelevant stuff). and then there are those that answer to the point, and from the way they write, you can tell that they not only have a command of the basic concepts/theories and how to apply them but know the limitations of their positions and can suggest how to move beyond them. all this of cuz presupposes you really know what you're doing. a lot of reading and understanding of the subject is required. but that doesn't mean a lot of writing has to be done in the exam hall. you can do credibly well just answering to the point and doing it in such a way that shows you're pretty knowledgeable abt the subject. writing style matters here. some ppl are really good at suggesting (in their essays) that they know the issues involved when really they don't. if you can convince the examiner you know more than you actually do (99.99% of students are in the exam hall trying to do precisely this. actually to the extent that they actually succeed, exams also train us to be good at marketing - i.e., playing up the positive and downplaying the negative in a way that makes us look good - a skill that is useful not only in the workplace but in life more generally), then you're well on your way to a good grade.<br><br>having said all the crap that i have, besides testing whether the examinee knows what on earth he/she has been taught the past semester, exams also test other qualities like the ability to write in a concise and lucid manner, the ability to understand and answer a question in a relevant manner, maybe even the ability to handle stress, amongst other things. and besides putting less emphasis on the final exams (like reducing the percentage that these exams actually contribute towards the overall grade), more emphasis needs, i believe, to be placed on changing our mindsets towards what is expected of us in exams. if the exams are meant to test our ingenuity or creativity, then a different kind of stress will be placed on us. but one, perhaps, that is more "fun" and enjoyable (yes, i actually know ppl who enjoy exams. they enjoy it cos that's where they can show off that they're better than the rest).<br><br>if not for the problem of the lack of man-power and stuff like that, i actually favour some form of oral examination. phd dissertations require a "public" defense of your thesis from members of a dissertation committee and from other interested parties (usu ppl who are abt to go thru a defense themselves or other ppl from the dept who have nothing else better to do). in a face-to-face scenario, it's harder to bluff your way thru. plus oral exams test how well you speak and deliver your points (this is crucial to how well you perform at work) and how well you can think on your feet (which is good for any number of things, including explaining to your gf why you forgot her birthday). in other words, oral exams test whether you really know your stuff and whether you can communicate what you really know. now that'll be stressful wouldn't it?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>last but certainly not least, hi sparkie!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, my supervisee, Qwerty,<br><br>Actually, examination is a human invention for the academic world to evaluate a person's knowledge and aptitude on the course of study. Of course, we know that it is not true, but there exists no way out, unless someone comes with a better alternative like an open book exam, or a takehome exams (which is popular in US). For those who love the subject, it is an enjoyment studying for the exams, and those who hate the subject, it is a chore. However, there exist the muggers as well, who study for the sake of good grades.<br><br>If you ask me, can an exam really evaluate a person's ability? The answer is no. It is difficult to tell how good a person is, by his examination results, because it is unfair to evaluate by a few hours, sitting in the examination room and reproduce all the things that are taught to you. Well, at least, I can tell you that most of the best scientists which came from your university (and mine too), are not the top students of their year. Apparently, a book is written on it and you, and normally, they are only 2nd upper (or equivalent) can find it in the Rayleigh library, and it was mentioned that the examination which you are undergoing, is just only examination which tests you on memorisation of facts and problem solving skills, and it does not evolve you into an educated person.<br><br>I always believed that a person has to educate himself by reading and thinking more on the subject and interacting with people as well. A successful person is responsible for his education and not blaming his teachers or lecturers, because they are only here to guide. The path is still taken by you to learn. Our education only ends, when we die.  As my teacher once told me something important when I did badly in my exams last year,"There are no wrong turnings, but only roads to walk which you thought you were not meant to." Unlike Singapore, where people view so much on success and failure, the people on our side of the world do not evaluate a person based on a exams, which I think is an attitude that Singapore needs to change in years to come.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i never thought that exams r testing ur understanding of the subject. look at wat we r taking in sec skool...maths, science, history...do we really apply these in the working field?<br><br>i blif dat exams r there to test the determination of the student. the employer wont want a student who can recite the history of mongolia! he has the internet to do dat for him! wat he wants is a worker who strives for better results, and not easily deterred by long periods of work (studies, in the case of exams).<br><br>wat good grades in exams really show is the many months of determined studies before the few hours of writing.</div>

I prob won't be bothered to read all those stuff that would make me fall asleep.<br><br>Right now, my faculty is starting to place less emphasis on exams..sometimes the weightage of the exams is only 40%, with the remaining being taken up by indiv projects, group projects, assignments, midterm tests, and even class participation. But, no matter how much we students hate them, exams are still necessary to ensure that we have at least a certain level of understanding of the subject.  There are always free-riders in group projects, and even in indiv projects, we would still discuss among ourselves and everybody would have similar answers. Thus, exams is the best way to test each and every individual based on their own ability.<br><br>And to counter the problem of students who merely memorise rather than understand the materials, we have a number of open-book exams. I like open-book exams because that means that I do not have to remember facts and can spend my time to fully understand the stuff that i'm reading. But on the other hand, I hate open-book exams coz they are really tough and they really test how much you understand a certain topic, how well you can apply what you have learnt to a new case or scenario.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>(to qwerty and revelations, happy studying   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">)</div></blockquote>Well, I love open book tests too, but too bad we don't have it here.
