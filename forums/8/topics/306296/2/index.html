                                      is also a dermatologist..</span></p>
              <p> <span style="color: #ae3cee;">he gave me one facial wash, one
                                      oil lotion to apply on face aft wash, 2 types of antibiotics.. add
                                      up cost abt $180.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ae3cee;">im v forgetful when it comes to
                                      taking medicine on a daily basis.. so i din finish my antibiotics..
                                      and now im left with a bit of facial wash.. my acne problem has
                                      improved a bit.. but i dun think i'll go back to him again. 
                                      watch wat u eat, drink more water, always keep ur face and pillow
                                      clean and try not to sleep late will help.</span></p>

              <p>yeah, but derma very expensive leh, somemore no guarantee will heal.</p>
              <p>i've been to see my derma for several years and not much improvement at all....pimples, even if go away, will return 2 - 3 months later, and the cycle repeats....</p>
              <p><br>anyway, i think after CNY, i'll use my angbao $ to try the neighbourhood beautician and see how it goes. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>how old are you Nikar?the pills doctors prescribe to you is suppresses Androgen levels in your body</p>
              <p>Androgen are actually hormones in your body that will affect your puberty period ( growing acne, height and whatever ) . by suppressing it, you would get less acne.</p>
              <p>Acne grows as a result of vitamins defieciency in the body. Drink lots of water, take more vegetables ( fibre ) .</p>
              <p>Cut a tomato in half, apply the fleshy side on our face ( lets your face absorb the vitamin C and cellulose.</p>

              <p>ditto. just that i didnt let them con me. they are mad. NYSS skin consultants are BIG TIME scammers. said i won free consultation and treatment then before actually providing the treatment ask me sign up this that, totalling 1.5k. think im made of cash eh.</p>
              <p>and if you've noticed, the channel 8 beauty lifestyle show keep featuring 3 typical problems with 3 standard solutions</p>

              <p>I just saw the show on ch 8 beauty lifestyle 4 and it actually says tat NYSS can actually cure pimples. If its fake, how come they can get people to interview and then speak out for them on the show?</p>
              <p>I have just signed the package recently with them. Costing me $553. It includes 10 sessions and some other products. The product which i got was just a cream for acne. I had to top up another $60 plus for the facial wash and toner. So in total, was abt $610. Did the first session already. Really saw that my pimples are going off really quickly and my face getting better. Of course they are quite pushy and i know that they get commission out of it tats why they want to get u to sign as much as possible. Do know what you're doing if you really want to go there. Don't just anyhow sign any packages. Some may be useless de and u end up paying alot. Know what u spend and what is included in the treatment. The more money u pay doesn't mean that the treatment will be better and higher chance of recovery.</p>
              <p>I know that when it comes to earning money, they won't care what u need. They will just give u everything. Some may be good and some may not. A guildline will be to take the most basic one first. Den see how is the result. If u want to upgrade, u can do it later. I have worked in sales before and i've seen my own coleagues doing that too. Its so sad that people dun care abt the needs of their customer anymore. They just want money. Welcome to the reality of this world!</p>

              <p>hi all,</p>
              <p>recently, my face (left and right cheeks) have been growing a lot of big red pimples and now i'm very worried and want to fix it before it gets worse.</p>
              <p>i went to see a doctor (demartologist) but no use, so i'm thinking of trying those neighbourhood beauty centers that have ads for clearing your pimples, giving you smooth skin etc...</p>
              <p>now, anyone got try those before? is it expensive? good anot? i'm thinking of spending my new year ang-baos on them.</p>
              <p>i'll be very grateful!!!! :)</p>

              <p>Nolah seriously go dermatologists. These doctors are qualified skin specialist. They don't go study expensive and long for nothing one you know. Neighbourhood beauticians are only decent for a simple facial massage and plucking eyebrows. Anything more than that go specialist. You don't want to get scarred for life for nothing.</p>
              <p>Yah, like some forumites said, eat more fruits and veggies, drink lots of water and have enough sleep and your pimples will go away one.</p>
