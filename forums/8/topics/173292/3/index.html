Two years ago decided to move to five rooms as children grown up and both parents want to live with me.  The 3 rooms flat did not have lift at all and no one want to buy.  After trying to sell for two years, spoke to HDB who is ok to buy back.  They sent valuer to value the flat at $188k.  ( I bought at $250 k ).  We must pay penalty of 10% which is 18k.  BUT HDB also want to value current 5 rooms flat also.  IF the value is higher, the penalty will based on 5 rooms.  I asked, if my five rooms is worth $300k ( I bought at $320K ) then the penalty will be $30k.  HDB will take back my flat at ( $188k - $30K), which will be $158k.  I will lose about $92K !!!!!<br><br>HDB is blood sucking poor citizen who is in desperation !!!!!  Now, I got to servce two loans ...

I dare not even let my relative stay in when they needed a temporary place.  So damn stupid policy...  don't allow you to rent out, then make thing so difficult.  I think the officer ( a senior one ) don't know anything when advising me...  realised his fault then try to delay the whole process.  That's why take two years.  I asked him to write to me about this policy as I may need external help so black and white can help solve misunderstanding.  He promised to email but till date since no news.  Seeking legal help means paying legal fee.

I doubt I can get another loan for this.  The officer told me the valuation for my flat is $188k.  But a check with HDB website, it showed similar flat at the area is about $200k....
