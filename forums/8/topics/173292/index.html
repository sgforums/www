( I bought at $250 k ).  We must pay penalty of 10% which is 18k.  BUT HDB also want to value current 5 rooms flat also.  IF the value is higher, the penalty will based on 5 rooms.  I asked, if my five rooms is worth $300k ( I bought at $320K ) then the penalty will be $30k.  HDB will take back my flat at ( $188k - $30K), which will be $158k.

            <div class='col-md body'>They seem to penalize ppl who wanted to buy the 2nd flat and sell the 1st. Their policy seem to be against ppl who switch. My father has finished paying up the current flat and intend to buy one near me but if he did not sell his current flat he will have no money to pay for the new flat.<br><br>So there is the catch-22 situation. If he sold off before he get a new flat he will be homeless. If he buy the new one before selling his current flat, he will be saddled with payment for the new flat.<br><br>The story goes deeper if one has not finished paying the current flat and wanna do a upgrade or downgrade. It seem watever way it is lose money. One way out of it is dun buy hdb but buy condo lor and those restrictions are lifted but condo prices also not cheap.<br><br>Conclusion: Once get a hdb flat live until you get evicted by gahmen due to upgrading or until you die. So for first timer who bought flat best to choose one nearby to parents but then usually those flats ard are old  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
