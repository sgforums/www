            <div class='col-md body'>I know my ass will be flamed by hordes of people, my life will be on the line, my reputation at stake, my ego busted and woman will want to hold me by my balls and squeeze...<br><br>Ok basically, you people out there will either love me or hate me for saying these.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Before any rocket launchers come pointing my way...just hear me on what I have to say...<br><br>I have many woman friends. I have had girlfriends. Not many really....but enough to know about woman. I often have conversations over some Earl Grey with these woman friends of mine, and sometimes the topic will revolve around the differences of the sexes. I have always respected woman, believing them to be an equal of a man, only that we behave and react differently to different situations. In fact I have some woman friends who packs quite a powerhouse background. Some are their own boss, some are hold in high regard due to their work ability, some are potential directors for MNCs...yes...they are good and capable people. So why am I saying that woman are contradiction? This has nothing to do with their work ability, nor capability. It is the thought process itself that I am pointing to here.<br><br>I have asked them sometimes...what do you ask in a man?<br><br>I get varied answers....but I sum these up as the most common answers.<br><br><blockquote><br>I want a man who is not very handsome, but must be lookable.<br><br>I want a man who is chivalrous (or gentlemanly) but chauvinistic enough at the same time.<br><br>I want a man who is not very successful in his career, but must have amass enough success in his work to maintain his position.<br><br>I want a man who is not rich, but financially stable enough to maintain my lifestyle.<br></blockquote>Well, looking at it this way....are the woman telling me that they are all looking for a Mr. Average? Look at the woman on the streets and most of them are with the best guy around. Else it must be some rich fat ugly man with the babes on his side. Hmmm...it must be really hard to be a Mr. Average then, why else are so many Mr. average (me included) not attached? Something is wrong with the fate machine. They forget to program it to detect the Mr. Average around. The one which so many woman wants.<br><br>Of course you are going to say that what you ask for is not necessary what you get...well...here are some of the contradicting conditions you gals ask for in a man.<br><br><blockquote><br>I want a man who has time for me but successful in his career.<br><br>I want a man who is good in bed but not have sex very often.<br><br>I want a man who knows how to treat a woman good but knows how to tease her to love him at the same time.<br><br>I want a man who loves his parents...but must love me just as much.<br><br>I want a man who is athletic, has a great body...but not crazy about sports.<br><br>I want a man who takes good care of me and gives me the sense of security, but must give me space to lead a independent life.<br></blockquote>The list goes on and on...and I did not make them up...they are all from...you guessed correctly...woman.<br><br>Now let's see....what do we have? A man who is successful in his career most probably dun have a lot of time for his girlfriend or wife...I am a business person...and I have seen many successful guys who dun have time for the family. And basically a man who is good in bed is most of the time a man who gets a lot of practice...in this case...how can he not have sex very often? And of course a man who treats a woman good would not want to play mind games with her. As for the parents part....for those out there who are married Â… I am sure you all know how it works...most of the time it is either mum and pa or just wife and the children....it always have to be a choice between them. Basically if a man has a great body...he works out a lot. And if a woman is independent...she would not need a man to take care of her.<br><br>So how are these contradictions summing up?<br><br>Well...another contradiction of woman which I am sure a lot of you guys here have seen before....the way they rejects us. Here are a couple of examples...<br><br><blockquote><br>Callan, it is not you it is me...you are too good for me.<br><br>The problem does not lie with you, the problem lies with me. You are a perfect guy, but I am not a perfect girl.<br><br>I treat my friends better than my lover, and I think you deserve good treatment from me, so let's just be friends.<br><br>You are my greatest friend, and I treat my friends better than my lovers.<br><br>I am not your type, so it would not be possible.<br><br>I am not for you, you would not like me.<br><br>This is not a rejection line...but...<br>^------(contributed by Sonic)------^<br></blockquote>Well...looking at these rejection lines...I just sense each and everyone as a contradiction. Well...if I am good...perfect....why would you not want me? It just does not make sense...well....as for the friends part...I once got so piss at the answer that I cursed under my breath.."yah you screw your lover but you would not screw me, is that it?". Didn't woman always wanted a man who can be a lover and friend at the same time? Well....if you are not my type I would not have asked you in the same place...you can say that I am not your type...but you can't tell me that I am not your type simple because you are not me.<br><br>Well...another thing about woman....have you people not notice a rather strange trend nowadays? I give you people a real life experience I have...<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">I like this gal very much....I am the very nice guy who would always be there for her...take care of her when she is sick...lend her my shoulders to cry on....give her a hug to assure her that I am there for her...well basically...I am the nicest guy she has ever met.(She told me that, I am not blowing my own trumpet) Well....there is a problem...she had a boyfriend...a total jerk...he would humiliate her in public...treat her like a property...take her as his free maid...and of course the object to vent his sexual frustrations on. Well...she refuses to leave him because she says she loves him too much to give up. (what is there to love in him anyway?!?) Of course she got dump in the end after he found his next fresh free maid. She came crying to me...blah blah blah...and then say that I am the best thing that happen to her...blah blah blah...of course I comforted her and she felt better after a couple of months...then I decided maybe it is time I pop the question...and guess what? She rejected me, saying she found someone better...and runs off with the next best jerk that comes along....ok I told myself that I am not for her...and of course history repeats itself....she got dump by another jerk...and I again becomes her fairy god mother who mend her heart...and of course again she runs off...now she is with the 4th best jerk...and I can only say good luck to her...and give up on her...I dun wanna be a dunlopillo Mattress cushioning her every time she falls...and then be alone again till she decides fall again.</span><br><br>So the moral of the story is? Well...How can woman be so contradictory? Well..the perfectly nice young man is right in front of her begging and waiting for her to nod her head, off she runs off begging the jerks to take her in.  and no she is not the only woman whom I have met in life who falls into this cycle...there are a whole lot of them out there....is it not contradicting?<br><br>Of course...these contradictions does not only stops in R/S problems...The modern woman too often cries out loud for equality of the sexes....and than they will claim that man are not gentlemanly to them...that we do not carry their shopping bags for them...that we do not open the doors for them...hmmm...I am wondering if they want equality....or the perks of equality with the original benefits of being a woman kept intact....what do they want at all?!?!?<br><br>Ain't women supposedly to be better at managing emotions than men? If so....why are they causing so much trouble for themselves then? It is one big contradiction all together.<br><br>BUT...one thing I still believe in...it is that...the very reason woman are so intriguing...and interesting...is simply because of such contradictions...and man can be quite a contradiction to like them for it themselves.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------</div>

You are not worth it man.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Just want to echo something that you might have hinted in your thread. It sure is a contradiction why we as guys still lust/ desire/ chase after them even when they cause so much heartache.<br><br>Bottom line, heartaches are heartaches. We like them, they don't like us, it hurts. Contradiction or no contradiction.<br><br>Whether you lament the fact that you tried or regret that you can be so foolish as to put your feelings on the line for someone who respects neither you nor themselves, it still hurts. And we still go back for more. Because we men are such magnificant creatures, except those bastards who still manage to get all the babes and ladies and girls. Bloody unfair. I spit on them man, ptui. Other than them the rest of us are magnificant. Lonely, but magnificant.<br><br>[This message has been edited by pacman (edited 29 September 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ah lanz (haven't call you this for ages)<br><br>I seriously thinking about this "wonderful" yet almost draggy essay of yourz. I can't decide if I wanted to reply but after I hit on the "reply button" it seems i'm too lazy to click back again, so might as well reply some nonsenses here!<br><br>Be it man or woman, we are alwayz contradicting ourselves. As they alwayz say, love is blind. I believe that is very true. Every average person wants an very "average" partners but what is the definition of "average". I pop the same question to people who told me that this girl is damn jude, cute, chio etc and I will ask them, what is your definition of "jude, cute, chio etc".<br><br>Woman ain't the only one stating those contradiction, man does it too. In fact, sometimes I tell myself that I'm not aiming to be rich but financial steady to do what I want to do, and that almost equals be "rich"! But sometimes, we have to look at it from the point that "what do YOU have to offer for the partner".<br><br>You are only a normal person walking on the street, nothing impressive, nothing attractive and wish for someone like Brad Pitt or Jennifer Aniston, I would say, DREAM ON! Before seeking for "better" and "higher" qualified partners, think about what do you have to give?<br><br>I remember a so-called beauty once told me that she can attract guys relatively easily, so she ask for a good and much sought-after guys rather than those averages ones. She believe she has a lot of offer in return too and when I bring up the subjects of "everyone wants that guys, so temption comes in" and she believe that if the guy leaves her, its HIS losses. Is this full of confidences? I do not know and don't bother to find out coz the so-called beauty ain't that a beauty either.<br><br>Anyway, this is not targetting at ah lanz and neither to defend him. Just my humour opinion. Let see what the rest have to say.<br><br>p.s - what prompts you write such a long and "touchy" issue?<br><br>------------------<br>"In physics, mathematics and astronautics it means over thirty; in other disciplines, senile decay is sometimes postponed to the forties. There are of course, glorious exceptions; but as every researcher just out of college knows, scientists of over fifty are good for nothing but board meetings, and should at all costs be kept out of the laboratory" - Arthur C Clarke</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just wanna to add in a few lines which came to my mind which i read on this topic.<br>I was thinking that many times when we look for something, we tend to look further ahead when things r actually so near us. Dont u think that we are very stupid in alot of times? And in a lot of cases, when one is attached, one can still look on for better ones but they never know the good things that his or her stead has already brought but just neglecting them. It will only be missed and yearned for when they are lost. Aren't we contradicting ourselves too?<br>Not only man but woman also, we always demand and ask for more, but have we ever asked ourselves how much have we done instead?<br>So y not just do our part in watever things we r in and not doubt on the outcome or how much the other party is giving too???<br><br>Treasure with what you have,<br>Not regret with what you have lost.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>I think the core of this contradictory issue comes from the point that most of us know what we DON'T WANT.

I may find tat callan(sorrie ah, use u for a while) is a very nice guy, he treats gal well..etc.<br>BUT, i have no special feelings towards him at all.<br>(the word BUT seems so often commonly used. *grinz*)<br>I dun have the thinking of spending most of my time with him or rather, sharing my life with him. I dun feel myself wanting to hug him. I dun feel myself wanting to get any physical closeness with him.<br>Those affectionate and passionate feelings tat we gals want, we will want it from someone we love....and not from someone who is a nice person but we have no feelings for them at all.<br><br>ok, after blahing so much, wat have i conclude? I haven see any conclusion. I am feeling contradicting myself.<br>But, i am sure that, u want her to be with you out of real love and not only by infatuation or tat u are a nice person.<br><br>Rejection lines.<br><br>Oh, sorry, BUT u are not my type.<br>I am not good enough for you.<br>I am a very busy person, i dun have the time for a relationship.<br>I am in love with someone else.<br>You are good, i find myself comfortable talking to you....BUT....*grinz*<br><br>Saw my last pt above? contradicting....haaa...<br><br>Callan, about the experience tat u have encountered, it happened to my frens b4 too.<br>From my point of view, the gal isn't showing any interest in the first place at all. She told u tat u are a nice person. That's the most misleading part n words a gal can ever say to a guy.<br>Maybe it's becoz of those words tat made u think tat u stand a good chance. But only to feel disappointed when the gal left with another jerk.<br>Well, maybe tat guy is not a jerk. It's just tat u are better than him in some ways or the gal made u feel tat u are the best....and all the guys she met are jerks.

It is really up the the female taste rt?  Beauty is within the eyes of the beholder...<br>*gentlemanly but chauvinistic is not hard to acheive.  I have met many guys that are like that.  It's really up to the situation that the guy is facing...You must know when to be nice and when to be strict...<br>*not too successful in his career, but must be able to do good at what he does at work.  Get it? He doesn't have to be good at everything, just be good at what he does is good enuff...<br>*rich and financially stable is totally different things, so I don't see why it is contradicting.  I don't need to drive a BMW or a porche, but gimme a decent car to drive.<br>*being successful in his career doesn't mean he has to spend every minute in the office rt? the guy must know how to divide his time properly...If you can't spend time with me on Mon-Fri, gimme the weekends!<br>*good sex might not mean have to practice for it.  Maybe during the marriage stage the guy already got enuff practice?!  Reading magazine might also help... =P<br>*treating a women good doesn't not mean no mind games.  It means mind games that won't hurt the gal.  Just something to keep the excitment in the relationship.<br>*for the parents thing, not all women ask her husband to choose between her and his family.<br>*having a nice body, well...you can spend 1 hr or so in the gym.  Doesn't mean you have to be that into sports.<br>*security and independent life...why not? A woman always needs someone to care for her.  But yet, she wants to do what she wants to do also, caring for a gal doesn't mean you have to be at her face all the time...<br><br>As for the rejections...would guys rather us tell them the truth?<br><br>*Sorry but you are just not my type.<br>*You are not really in my league.<br>*You are not lookable enuff for me...<br>and so on...<br><br>Gals will only lie to the guy when they care for them.  It's like a nicer way to reject inorder to save the friendship. If I don't care for the guy, I will just tell him to "fork off" straight and direct, but will you want to befriends with me after that?  Don't think so...<br><br>As for your story on jerks...all I can really tell you is...chemistry.  If the chemisty is not there..no matter how nice, how loving, how much you offer, I will not like you in return.<br><br>Like others that said here...all humans are contradicting...so I don't think this is fair to target women as the only walking contradiction...<br><br>enjoy!<br><br>------------------<br>Float like a butterfly...sting like a bee...<br><br>[This message has been edited by NaiveGirl (edited 29 September 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok I am shameless, I ask all of you here to have a look at the topic, but I did not imagine that all of you would grace my thread with thy words above. *laffs*<br><br>now now one by one....<br><br>Packy:<br><br>We man are one contradiction, but we contradict because women contradict themselves. Go figure why I said that, I think you should be able to understand. And I dun like to be lonely and Magnificient, I rather be happy but jerky.<br><br>Ah bish(have not call you this for ages too) :<br><br>Well, like a lot of people says beauty is in the eyes of the beholder? I think this sentence have been over-used, so much that people are using it without thinking. It has almost become an excuse for people who can't find pretty gf/handsome bf. I might sound crude, but let's face it, yes there is beauty in everyone, I believe in that, it is whether you see it or not, but there will be idioits out there who see no beauty in that someone they are with but still wantsthem for the sake of having a gf.<br><br>And no,I dun think that a person should only ask for what is on the same level as he is. This limits progress, I always ask for more than I can handle, it urges me to carry on improving or I will not be able to handle it. An I believe in becoming a better person for your partner, and like I told people before, the best compliment I can ever give the poerson I love, would be that she makes me want to be a better man. So what is wrong in askign for more? There is nothing wrong on our part, just the end decision made by that better person whether to accept you or not. So to all ladies out there, dun reject a guy just because you think he is not good enuff for you, but reject him because he is not willing to improve.<br><br>Ok,I need to rush off, so I will reply to the rest later, pardon me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
