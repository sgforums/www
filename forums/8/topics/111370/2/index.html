Thus even if they survive, what happened if something bad struck? Do they have enough money for rainy days? How to pay for the mortgage of their small HDB home (maybe 99 year loan??)?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ooh, looks like we have some new members here.  Welcome, Cindy and Monaro!<br><br>Okay, first and foremost, whenever we get into this topic, it turns into a "what's bad about Singapore" issue instead of "what's good about country X", and later, of course, "what's bas about coiuntry X".  Let's not go that way, eh?<br><br>I'm an Australian PR, and like Monaro said, Melbourne's a nice place to be.  I do, however, agree with his point about NS and its benefits.  By the time I have kids aged 18 years, I will probably have been too firmly entrenched in Australian society to send them for NS in Singapore, but in any case, how the kids turn out is largely the parents' work rather than MINDEF's.  Whatever I've picked up from NS will be passed down to my kids - if you've seen kids from the country, Monaro, you'll notice that by and large, they're a lot more well-behaved than the city kids, or Singaporean kids for that matter.<br><br>Monaro, you're doing psych too, huh?  Which year of uni are you in?</div>

Perhaps you can send your sons there. If you become an Aussie, I think your son can volunteer for the army right? Yes I do heard that assuie teenagers are bummers, but come to think of it, how about the Singapore bengs and lians?<br><br>The SAT is really a fiasco. The SAT maths are the most our sec 2 maths which are tested in O levels. As for the English part, it is only about vocabs memorisation in which Singaporean kids are good at. Also, I thought that vocabs are tested in the comprehension part in O levels and General paper? Thus, I say the requirement of SAT in Singapore is a total waste of money. Although, it is a good way to donate money to the US government.</div>
