            <div class='col-md body'>basically all these problems are cause by the NKF saga. before that incident happened, i happened to participate in 1 flag day and my tin was about 1/4 or more full of coins with about 5 or more $2 notes inside. Many people before the incident automatically come up to you and donate money. after that incident, i done another flag day and people seems not so willing to donate their money. many even question where these donations will go to before actually donating.<br><br>another problem is that some students, usually the minority will usually fool around when doing flag day. some will just dump a few coins inside and go watch a movie before returning the tin. so the adult volunteers may think you are fooling around when doing flag day.<br><br>one last problem is that during these flag days, usually alot of students are mobilised to do these donations. so anywhere you go, you can see people asking for donations. during my lasst flag day, whereever i go, on the mrt, buses, i see people from my school asking for donations. cause all the year 1 poly students are asked to participate in flag day. so because of lesser donations nowadays plus more and more students participate in flag day, your money collected in the tin will generally get lesser.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If I were the student, I would most likely throw back the tin can at him b4 walking off away.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  In my opinion, CIP involving collection of monetary collection is simply stupid and not educational and not meaningful as well. Why can't schs organise events such as collection of food, clothes, bks etc which pple dun want and donate to the needy or else can sell the donated items b4 donating the money from the proceed to the needy. I had done old newspaper collection during my JC years and I found it to be fun however tiring. The newspapers collected were sold and the money donated to partly sch fund as well as charities. I would say this kind of CIP is much much more better than tin-collection of donations.</div>

I would say this kind of CIP is much much more better than tin-collection of donations. </div></blockquote>The main reason most charity organisation opted for flagdays is because handling cash is much easier and doesn't require the logistic as much as that of collecting food,clothings, etc. Such donation-in-kinds drive takes up more space and usually require more logistic and difficult to run, especially if the organisation have small space available for storage. Same situation for collection of newspaper,old clothings for re-sale purposes to raise funds.<br><br>For Example, the yearly Boys Brigade Sharity Gift Box is run by the Boys Brigade HQ and donations in kind is collected. However, we still receive those faulty electronics, expired food product, damaged furniture, which in turn, we have to dispose off the item at our own cost. On top of this, much needed items like diapers and elderly care products isn't collected.<br><br>Each year, though we have Semb Log which help us to sort out the items, packing them onto Pallets and delivering them to Boys Brigade HQ, we still need to engage heavy man-power to further sort and pack the items. And at times, during the end of the event, we will have out-standing donations such as rice which we have problems distributing them due to the bulkiness and the non-availability of logistic and transportation.</div>
