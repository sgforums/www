            <div class='col-md body'>is it really true that "jiak gan tang" pple who are <strong>born and educated in s'pore </strong>can't understand and speak a single shit of mandarin...?<br><br>most of the time when i speak mandarin to my classmates (who are self-proclaimed ENGLISH EDUCATED) , either they show me a disgusted and annoyance look or they refuse to carry on the conversation.<br><br>i used to be like them during sec school days, however as i get older i feel that (to me) mandarin is actually the language that is better in binding a chinese-to-chinese relationship. it is actually more endearing.<br><br>so, based on today's modern and 'in' society, do u think i will be outcasted soon by fellow pple of my age group and younger???</div>
