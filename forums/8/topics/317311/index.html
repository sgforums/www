              <h1 class="clr">No reports of Singaporeans injured in China quake</h1>
              <p>Singapore’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said so far there has
              been no reports of any Singaporean being injured in China’s earthquake
              on Monday.</p>
              <p>In response to media queries, MFA said it was closely monitoring the
              situation in Sichuan Province after it was struck by a 7.8 magnitude
              quake in the afternoon.</p>
              <p>It said, "Our Missions have been in touch
              with the Chinese authorities, and will continue to establish contact
              with the Singaporean community in the affected areas."</p>
              <p>A Singaporean who works at the China World Trade Center in Beijing called MediaCorp to share his experience of the quake.</p>
              <p>Mr
              Philip Loh said he heard an "explosion" at about 2.30pm, but no action
              was taken by authorities as they had assumed the noise came from a
              nearby construction site.</p>
              <p>However, when they heard a second
              "explosion" moments later and the building shook, everyone was
              evacuated from the office towers, he said. Mr Loh added that no one was
              hurt and work resumed half an hour later, at about 3pm.</p>
              <p>Channel
              NewsAsia checked with several travel agencies and found that
              Singaporean tour groups in the affected areas are also safe. They said
              they felt the tremors, but were not in any danger.</p>
              <p>One of the tour agencies said it would continue with its tours, but may change some of the routes.</p>
              <p>Agencies
              whose tour groups were supposed to return on Monday said flights have
              been delayed as airports in Sichuan are closed. They are expected to
              return on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>An engineering expert told Channel NewsAsia
              this is one of the worst earthquakes in the area for the past hundred
              years — and he expects the death toll to rise.</p>
              <p>Professor Pan
              Tso—Chien, Dean, College of Engineering, Nanyang Technological
              University, said: "I wouldn’t be completely surprised if there are more
              fatalities reported, as we discover more, as we go into more places
              with buildings that have collapsed, or roads which have blocked that we
              cannot get in.</p>
              <p>"And by counting the numbers, I have a hunch that
              the numbers would climb. And as time goes, it may climb even faster
              before we reach the area." — CNA/al</p>

              <p><br>on the contrary, the earth is in the pink of health with earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.</p>
              <p>if no earthquakes or volcanic activity, means the earth's core is dead and in due time with the weathering and wasting, the earth would be one flat piece of land.</p>

              <p><br>it has very little to do with digging, the continental lithosphere is 250km to 300km, don't think any machinery can dig that deep yet.</p>

              <p>it has more to do with plate tectonics.</p>
              <p>but SiChuan isn't situated in an earthquake subduction zone, like Japan or California.</p>
              <p>the only explanation that's logical is to the impacting of india into asia which resulted in the himalayas. india is still being forced into asia, which probably resulted in the stress of the plates causing it to fracture in SiChuan thus producing the 7.8 richter scale earthquake.</p>

              <p>During peaceful times, people start gettig restless and do things that is harmful to nature, and to one another. Maybe this is one way mother nature is shower her anger, that ppl should stop their harmful actions( Strikes, war) and get busy in other things.</p>
              <p>While many of us live in a peaceful and disaster free spore, and busy comparing with one another of what we do not have, you may want to send some time reflecting on what we have and learn to appreciate life, and the fact that we are so alive.</p>

              <p>just found out my theory quite sound as supported by others. quite baffling for me initially because there was no subduction zones, so what was the cause of the earthquake. the question is whether this quake open up a subduction zone in the sichuan province, thereby making it another earthquake prone region like Japan or California. 3,000 aftershocks is quite something else, there were widespread quakes along the sichuan and gansu region, just wondering if this is a prelude to a transform fault (where the eurasian plate breaks into 2 parts and they slide past each other to counter the force of impacting india).</p>

              <p><em><a href="http://www.earthquakes.bgs.ac.uk/latest/eastern_sichuan_12052008/eastern_sichuan_12052008.htm">The seismicity of central and eastern Asia is caused by the northward movement of the India plate at a rate of 5cm/year and it’s collision with Eurasia, resulting in the uplift of the Himalaya and Tibetan plateau and associated earthquake activity. This deformation also results in the extrusion of crustal material from the high Tibetan Plateau in the west towards the Sichuan Basin and southeastern China.</a></em></p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p><em><a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article3920256.ece">Dr Whalley said of the collision between the Indian and Eurasian plates: “The Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau are the consequences of this continuing northwards push. As well as creating these extensive high areas, India’s push also generates an eastwards spread of material away from the Tibetan plateau. In the Si-chuan area the margins of the plateau are being pushed under weaker sedimentary rocks. It is along one of the faults marking the boundary of these sediments that today’s earthquake occurred.”</a></em></p>

              <p>How to take precaution against earthquakes? Famous hindsight question... "Why did not take precautions?"</p>
              <p>Japan can only build supposedly earthquake proof buildings. When a quake strike Japan, they suffer damage just as any other unprepared country. Large or small numbers of casualties, its just the luck of the draw.</p>
              <p>Till today no one can predict an earthquake. Animals are said to be able, but that is only on hindsight. Before the quake, an animal's odd behaviour would always be dismissed as discomfort. The realisation comes only after the quake.</p>
              <p>Life.</p>
              <p>So far for us, it only happens to others. Does our government take precautions against earthquakes? We will ask that question after the fact.</p>

              <p><br>it has very little to do with digging, the continental lithosphere is 250km to 300km, don't think any machinery can dig that deep yet.</p>

              <p>it has more to do with plate tectonics.</p>
              <p>but SiChuan isn't situated in an earthquake subduction zone, like Japan or California.</p>
              <p>the only explanation that's logical is to the impacting of india into asia which resulted in the himalayas. india is still being forced into asia, which probably resulted in the stress of the plates causing it to fracture in SiChuan thus producing the 7.8 richter scale earthquake.</p>

              <p>its a matter of cause and effect, just look at Nicoll Highway line collapse. You dig just maybe 100m and what happened?</p>
