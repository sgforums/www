            <div class='col-md body'>Just eat lots of protein without fats (eg. egg white, white meats, etc.).  And I mean lots....like maybe 5 times of what you're eating per day now.  Then do heavy weights about 3 times a week lor (target all the major muscle groups can liow).  Can succeed one lah, but must be patient because can take weeks to months to notice the first results.<br><br>You can adjust your food as you go along - to have more or less proteins, depending on how fast or slow you're growing.<br><br>Er....lastly, the best thing to do is to consult a professional.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bladez87,<br><br>Wings is lats (the triangle pieces below your armpits, which stretch to your waist).  If you've seen Bruce Lee movies where he did his pre-fight stretching, you'll know what wings are.  Wing training has to be done carefully, safest done with machines.  Any movement which pulls in (opposite of chest press) will use wings.  Chin-ups also use wings.<br><br>Pects is neh-neh (chest).  Heavy bench/chest presses for mass (different angles if you're going for competition, but not necessary for normal people), flyes for definition and 'carving/fine-tuning'.<br><br>Professionals usually recommend 3-4 sets for building.  1st two sets, lighter weights, 12 reps.  Last two sets, heavier weights, 8 reps.  Correct resistance/weight is when you have difficulties the last two reps of each set.<br><br>I feel that push-ups is not really useful for muscle building leh, but only for endurance.  For neh-neh, the only way to grow is heavy bench presses.<br><br>Um....178 cm, 60 kg.  Seems a bit lean leh.  You have to eat more lah.  Just stuff yourself with proteins.<br><br>Prodigy,<br><br>I like the way you said that time isn't on your side.  Its the same here!  I'm almost halfway through my lifespan for a local male. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>My problem area is my lower body, especially hamstrings.  I can't get them to grow in proportion to my upper body, no matter what.  I've engaged the help of so many friends who are professionals, and they also gave up on me.<br><br>Chunyong,<br><br>Aiyoh...abs is the hardest.  Fortunately, we're naturally skinny, so our abs are easier to see.<br><br>I get my abs through crunches and cardio (running, skipping, etc).  But if I do too much cardio, my whole body shrinks, including my face!!!  If I eat more and do less, the lines are not so defined.  Sigh...delicate balance.<br><br>The other way is to follow a bodybuilder's way (they don't do cardio because cardio prevents muscle growth).  A week before competition, they drink less water (not healthy) and walk about 45 minutes per day (thats a waste of precious time or 45 minutes of my life, if you ask me).<br><br>By the way, I'm not a bodybuilder at all.  In fact, I don't want to have big muscles....just toned, conditioned and defined.  I exercise almost everyday.  Been at it the last two decades already!  (But I do very very little weights).<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, I feel that bodybuilding is one of the ugliest and unhealthiest sports around.  No agility, no strength, expensive, no stamina, etc.  But everyone has their own hobbies and ideas of how they can feel good for themselves - and we should respect it all.  After all, if not for all those ugly big guys, how can we slim guys look good? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  Sour grapes....<br><br>Lets digress a bit..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Come on, come on, you lot.....admit it.  How many of you actually go to the gym to look at the opposite sex sometimes?  Or even the same sex?  I do (opposite sex only) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I know I'm not the only one.  Its known that gyms and fitness clubs are often more social and fit.  So out of curiosity, lets see how many are actual true fitness freaks here....<br><br>Out with it, people!</div>
