Lay off more than 2 weeks, your lifts will drop by about 20%. all weight training workouts to built muscles should be high intensity. But it is a good idea to alternate higher volume one week and lower volume another week  to avoid overtraining.

Most girls think overly muscular guys are digusting in the beginning, but they soon find the lean meat on the body nice to hug and hold (I dun know about fat meat will be the same to them), these lean meat when shaped correctly and proportionally can be quite pleasing to the eyes.

My legs are currently doing well as I run and cycle on a regular basis, usually 4km or more for running and 20km for cycling. However, my upper body i.e. chest, shoulders, biceps, etc are not that fantastic, and I have difficulty doing even chin-ups. The max. I can do now is only 4.<br><br>Hence, if anyone can give me some tips on improving my strength for chinups, such as what kind of exercises to use, which machines to use, etc, I'll be eternally grateful.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
