            <div class='col-md body'>Perhaps this will shed more light on the matter, or perhaps more confusion.<br><br><blockquote>They broke contest rules to be together<br>By Jeanmarie Tan<br><br>LAST night on television, you saw how Sivert Ong and bachelorette Rachel Lee walk off together into the sunset on the final episode of Eye For A Guy.<br><br>By now, you'd probably know that Sivert, 27, turned out to be the big loser because in reality, Rachel is actually going out with runner-up Mark Zee.<br><br>To make things more confusing, all three of them are heading for Paris together as part of the prize. Talk about menage a trois - but more on that later.<br><br>But how did it end up that way?<br><br>The simple answer is, because Rachel and Mark broke the rules.<br><br>You see, all the contestants had signed a contract with MediaCorp which prohibited them from contacting each other during the filming to prevent anyone from gaining an unfair advantage.<br><br>They were allowed to re-establish contact only until 'after production ended' - which meant after the whole filming process wrapped and the show is aired in its entirety - to limit information leaks.<br><br>Yet, Rachel, Mark, and even the other guys had frequently met one another after the last episode was shot.<br><br>They all claimed that the term 'after production ended' was 'vague', and that they had flouted the rules 'unintentionally'.<br><br>MEDIACORP'S REACTION<br><br>Not that MediaCorp appeared particularly bothered.<br><br>Mr Ng Say Yong, the executive producer for Eye For A Guy, said that it has taken a 'softer approach' in this case because 'the participants are new to showbiz, and may not know how things really work'.<br><br>He added: 'We've spoken with the parties concerned and we consider the issues amicably resolved.'<br><br>In mid-April, MediaCorp had warned Mark and Rachel to discontinue all communication between them, but eventually allowed them to see each other as long as they are 'discreet', said Rachel.<br><br>The couple, both 23, has been 'low-profile' since.<br><br>As for Sivert, it appears he was the only person who followed the rules religiously - he even mistakenly thought he could contact Rachel only when they went to Paris together.<br><br>But the good guy ended up losing the girl to the 'bad' boy.<br><br>When the three of them returned from Terengganu where the final episode was shot, Mark asked Sivert for 'permission' to call Rachel, after he managed to get her phone number from a friend.<br><br>Sivert told The New Paper he gave Mark the green light because 'it's not like I'm in love with her or anything'.<br><br>But once there was even a hint of competition, Sivert panicked and scrambled to pursue Rachel as well.<br><br>'After Mark called me, I was like 'Oh my God, I'm so stupid man'.<br><br>'So I called the producers to ask for her number, but they told me I couldn't do that.<br><br>'So I stopped there. I could've done the same thing (as Mark) because I have friends who know her, but I didn't initiate anything.'<br><br>He added that it didn't cross his mind to report Mark to the producers: 'I don't know why I didn't tell them. It's just not me to do that kind of thing.'<br><br>In fact, Sivert was kept in the dark about the couple's clandestine affair - until he bumped into them a month ago at an FHM party and saw them holding hands.<br><br>He recalled: 'I sensed some discomfort from them. But, honestly, I didn't feel awkward.'<br><br>But he did admit to feeling 'a little cheated'.<br><br>'But it's not a huge loss on my part. I was interested in getting to know her better, but hadn't reached that point where I was swept away.'<br><br>But surely his ego was bruised?<br><br>BITTERSWEET EXPERIENCE<br><br>'Definitely not,' he insisted. 'I did feel like the biggest loser of the show, but I recovered quickly.'<br><br>Although the Eye For A Guy experience has been 'bittersweet' for Sivert because of Rachel's shocking about-face as well as the show's 'fun but sometimes dull' proceedings, the threesome left together for Paris last night.<br><br>Mark, a polytechnic lecturer, had bought his own ticket.<br><br>'I'll be the biggest lamp post in Paris!' Sivert quipped, adding: 'Actually, I'm meeting some friends there.'<br><br>He claimed he had asked one of his female friends to join them on the trip as a 'double date thing', but she 'couldn't make it'.<br><br>He declined to reveal details about their relationship.<br><br>'She's a good friend. There's potential. But I'm not attached.'<br><br>Ah, sounds like the Norwegian-Chinese hair salon manager is the perfect candidate for Singapore's next reality TV bachelor - in a sequel entitled Eye For A Girl perhaps?<br><br>Sivert laughed: 'No-one has approached me yet, but I would be quite interested!'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>'We were under house arrest!'<br><br>'We were under house arrest!' THE happy lovebirds desperately want to be left alone and get on with their lives.<br><br>Since they started dating 1 1/2 months ago, Rachel and Mark have been holed up at his apartment almost every night and are allowed to go out in public together only from today.<br><br>She joked: 'We were practically under house arrest! I had to sneak in and out to avoid the neighbours.'<br><br>When asked why they persisted in meeting up despite being warned by MediaCorp, Mark said the time spent with Rachel was 'worth it'.<br><br>He said: 'I'm definitely not having fun (breaking the rules), but if I hadn't been able to see Rachel these past five weeks, it would've been a lot harder.<br><br>'We fell for each other pretty hard when production was over, that was when we had private time to really get to know each other and not have the crew hanging around.<br><br>'It's difficult to keep us apart. We're very serious about each other.'<br><br>HARDLY TALKED TO HER<br><br>Rachel explained that she chose Sivert because at that time, she was 'more comfortable' going to Paris with him.<br><br>She said: 'I knew he was a nice person, but I probably wouldn't date him. He's more friend material.<br><br>'When I met him at the Cleo Bachelor party the day after we filmed the last episode, he didn't appear to be interested in me because he hardly talked to me.'<br><br>When asked for reactions to Rachel's about-face, most of the show's suitors declined to make a judgment and wished them well.<br><br>One of them, Eugene Tay, said: 'Going for one guy then another... it happens all the time in real life. It's no big deal.'<br><br>Viewers may also baulk at the odd pairing - Rachel comes across on TV as ditzy and very Singaporean, and Mark is the confident ABC from Princeton.<br><br>HER TRINIDAD CONNECTION<br><br>Jumping to her defence, Mark insisted they're 'more compatible than people think'.<br><br>'She's so much more cosmopolitan than she appears. Her mother grew up in Trinidad and Tobago and my parents lived in Brazil, so we have a similar heritage. We get along so well, and the chemistry is undeniable.'<br><br>Maybe that's why - despite a very brief courtship - both of them are going to Paris together.<br><br>Mark said: 'This whole situation was magnified and we were pushed together faster. In terms of time, 1 1/2 months isn't long. But in terms of actual hours, it's much higher than normal.'<br><br>They jumped at the chance to tour the City of Romance together 'where people won't recognise either of us', said Mark.<br><br>As for their sleeping arrangements, both of them turned coy when asked about room-sharing.<br><br>Mark laughed: 'No comment! My parents are going to read this!'</blockquote></div>
