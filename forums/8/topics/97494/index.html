            <div class='col-md body'>Wow long time since i was last here... alot has happened to me... And wats with all the flaming of Fireice in Bar i see ar? LOL... Chiobu too long neva go out chiong liao issit... ppl think u guy??<br><br>Anyway i got to know this girl, both of us fell in love... She's 24 i'm 25... I even got to know her mum pretty well, her whole family in fact. And then she tells me that she's actually her boss' lover. He's bloody 45!!! Divorcee with a daughter...<br><br>I've heard alot about him from her... mostly negative stuff. I've even met him after he found out about us, cos she had wanted to end their relationship to be with me. He's one f*****. There isn't many ppl i'd dislike in this world. He comes up tops.<br><br>Can you imagine 4 yrs together and he's never given her any status? No one knows they're together. He claims its so that it won't affect her promotion in the company. He's never kissed her on the lips even when they were in bed... He verbally abuses her in the company whenever she "tee kee" back at him. Calls her f******* bitch and stuff. He even kicked her and always challenges to fight with him cos he's into martial arts. In the past 4 yrs, every time when she's so fed up she wants to leave, he'd threaten to recall back the $40k he loaned her. Threaten her with bankruptcy and stuff.<br><br>He did the same this time. But she reacted differently this time, cause i was willing to share her load. So he switched tactics. Claimed to want to commit suicide, can't live without her. Kept asking for a chance to change. Kept reminding her of their 4 yrs together, going through thick and thin and stuff before setting up this $10million company...<br><br>Guess what? She chose to give him a chance. Despite everything that screams that he doesn't love her. He refuses to go her house to know her parents cos he says that love is only between the both of them. What bullshit. Her best friends gave up trying to talk her out of it. Been trying since day 1. Been listening to her complain about him countless times. Yet everytime she went back to him.<br><br>She says and i know that she loves me. But we've only been together a short while. She feels that the old man does love her somewhat cos he did show some care and concern. I told her: A man dotes and showers his gf with affection, but every night he pushes her out into the streets to sell her body. Tell me does he love her or not? Its the same thing isn't it? He can have some traits that show love, but one single act would void everything else. But she doesn't get it, or doesn't want to get it. I don't know.<br><br>I don't expect any advice or what... just wanted an outlet...</div>
