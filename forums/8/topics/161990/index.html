            <div class='col-md body'>i am a 15 year old guy who plays hockey. i am quite skinny but rather fast compared to my team mates. i play on the wing for my team. while i manage to sprint past opponents, i often get pushed off the ball easily, even by 13 year old defenders. My coach tells me i am too weak for a boy my age and that i have to strengthen up. He made our whole team do chin ups and pushups for training and i was one of the few who could not do a single chin up and only managed about 9 proper pushups. i am about 5'7" and 105lbs, and my arms are very very thin.<br><br>am i really very weak? and wat should i do?<br><br>pple tell me that since im so skinny, i should be able to do alot of pullups since im lighter n when they find out i cant do any and can barely hang onto the bar for more than 15 seconds, they tell me im very weak. just wanted to noe whether they are being honest. m i really weak?<br><br>i do tink i am bcos i got into a fight which was my fault with a 13 year old kid not too long ago. he wasnt exactly big, but he was strong and he totally trashed me really bad, even leaving me really dazed on the ground after that. wat do u pple tink?</div>

My coach tells me i am too weak for a boy my age and that i have to strengthen up. He made our whole team do chin ups and pushups for training and i was one of the few who could not do a single chin up and only managed about 9 proper pushups. i am about 5'7" and 105lbs, and my arms are very very thin.<br><br>am i really very weak? and wat should i do?<br><br>pple tell me that since im so skinny, i should be able to do alot of pullups since im lighter n when they find out i cant do any and can barely hang onto the bar for more than 15 seconds, they tell me im very weak. just wanted to noe whether they are being honest. m i really weak?<br><br>i do tink i am bcos i got into a fight which was my fault with a 13 year old kid not too long ago. he wasnt exactly big, but he was strong and he totally trashed me really bad, even leaving me really dazed on the ground after that. wat do u pple tink?</div></blockquote>hey. haha. i think you are me. just that i am 3yrs older than you. i play hockey in my jc team. i played as a striker though. can run fast and evade frm the defenders. i'm 1.75m and 55kg. i'm thin too..<br><br>when i was 16, my 2.4km run was only 12.10min, i only managed to do 6-chin-ups for NAPFA.<br><br>when i am 18(this year), my 2.4km run is 9.45min and i did 9 chin-ups for my NAPFA.<br><br>frm a bronze in Sec 4 to a gold in JC 2 for NAPFA. don't despair. practice makes perfect. attend ur trainings regularly and soon, u can be the fittest of all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't know if this helps. My PE teachers says that doing push-ups will strengthen your arms, therefore, you can perform better at chin-ups. You can try it.</div>
