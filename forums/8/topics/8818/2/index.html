            <div class='col-md body'>I think its a matter of preference. Physically its nothing but a piece of skin blocking the entrance. If you look carefully, when people talk about virginity they refer to the female. Females are usually considered the ones who lose out when it comes to virginity because males experience no pain and mostly no psychological effects from past memories of lectures on intercourse by parents.<br><br>Without virginity you usually get someone who is more experienced in the ways of sexual ability. With a virgin you might get either a male or female with no idea whatsoever as to do during the consumation night. However I do believe that if one or both partners are non virgins they should not lie about it. And when it comes to marriage then the issue of sexual history comes into play. Is it rude to ask your spouse to go for a checkup before doing anything? Or should you trust his/her word of mouth when concerning matters related to his/her physical well being?<br><br>------------------<br>Honesty is the worse policy when taking an exam in CME</div>

As for gals who are virgin, it's sad to know that ur bf has already lost it. And if any of u were thinking of finding that some1 who is a virgin and then u will luv him/her, I'm sad to said that she/he does not deserve to have u as his/her partner. Cause if u luv him/her u will luv him/her for wat she/he is and not mind his/her past.</div>
