            <div class='col-md body'>Agree wif FireIce. To not be able to drink is a blessing.<br>No need to worry about getting caught by the traffic police cos of drunk driving. No need to worry about getting addicted to alcohol and throwing away so much money consuming that stuff and then spending money on your liver operation.<br>So hey! look on the bright side! So many pros den cons!</div>
