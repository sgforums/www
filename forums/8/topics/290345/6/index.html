Some cultures like the idea of a wholesome family life while some cultures like education and material wealth. I have malay friends who studied with me , liked the idea of starting a family after they got their degree. To them , family life is important and they like the idea of having their very own family. Is one wrong from the other? No.<br><br>Malays are very tight knit as a community and they are very lovely people. My mom (chinese btw) was admitted to hospital in Singapore with her children in Australia and my father working . The family of a malay patient actually FELT sorry for her that no one was visiting her during the afternoon. They made my mom felt like she was a family friend during her admission even though they were strangers to her and she a stranger to them.<br><br>I met Bruneian, Singapoean and Malaysian Malays who are actually damn smart. They come over to Australia to study for their Masters and PhD . They don't need prodding - they do equally well as their chinese/indian counterparts.<br><br>The family who is in this predicament ,without looking at their race, - they need help now. Yes it might have not been feasible to have 10 kids in their situation but it is  now done . No use crying over spilt milk.<br><br>I think the issue now is providing an education for their children so that they do not get trapped into the cycle of poverty and they will have an opportunity for skill training or further academic advancements. Once kids are educated , they look at their parents' mistakes and they won't make the same one again because they have lived through the<br>consequences.<br></div></blockquote><span style="color: green;">but there are too many black sheeps? seems like more then the white sheeps </span></div>
