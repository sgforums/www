In japan the men dont have national service but have to do things like firemen duty.Once a year they would go on a trip called 'Shobo Ryoko' (Firemen Field Trip) which is actually a sex trip 'sanctioned' by their wives.I bet Saudi Arabia has incentives for people planning a big family and Singapore garmen should give more also.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There is no racial harmony in singapore, only racial tolerance and i think this applies everywhere else in the world.<br><br>I have sympathy for the kids. They had no choice in their birth. The parents on the other hand deserve none. oh well..maybe they didnt have $$ to buy condoms.<br><br>As for the racial issues in this thread, well..look at the statistics. Look at and compare percentages. the percentage of malays in sg vs the percentage of local university students who are malays. Or how about the percentage of malays in sg vs the percentage people receiving welfare who are malays. Do some research and you get my point.<br><br>This the main reason why malaysia will always lag behind singapore.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I acknowledge that the Malays here are relatively behind their Chinese and Indian counterparts in almost all areas - but statistics have shown as a community they are by and large catching up. However small the percentage, the  university enrollment of Malays are increasing. Drug problems are nowhere near the catastrophe they were during the 1980s. The biggest issue facing the Malay community is the rise of social problems such as high divorce and abortion rates. You have to understand that the current generation is suffering from the failings of those beforehand - socio-economic problems are always a vicious cycle. Therefore, I find it admirable that the the lower echelons of the Malay community are at last making significant progress at breaking out of this cycle.<br><br>Such issues though, are not my main irritant in the postings of this topic.<br><br>What has social and economic problems got to do with racial harmony and tolerance?<br><br>If you're poor and uneducated, I still have a social responsibility, as a fellow human being, to show you respect. You don't spit at any man for no good reason, no matter if he is a millionaire or the unfortunate Chinese aunty who resorts to selling tissue paper at kopitiam for her earning.<br><br>The human tendency to moralize is forgivable. Even ignorance, to a certain extent, is pardonable. But the human urge to discriminate and sling mud at another group for being of a different colour cannot be tolerated for the sake of our humanity and basic decency.<br><br>My appeal to all members of SgForums is to don't let yourselves down by passing off the odd callous or racist remark. In attempting to degrade another race, you're just degrading yourself.<br><br>Thank you, and have a nice day.</div>
