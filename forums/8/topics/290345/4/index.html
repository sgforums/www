As much as they want us to create more babies, they wouldn't want them to be an economic burden. They want babies to grow up in a healthy environment, receive quality education, get a good job and <strong>PAY TAXES</strong>.

It take two hands to clap. I'm not saying all malays are like that or all chinese are good, I'm just saying that there ARE malays who are racist (encountered before personally) and there ARE chinese who will be racist back to them. We live in a non-ideal world, and certain things like these cannot be changed cos if there's a fault, everyone is at fault, if there's no fault, everyone can say they are innocent.<br><br>So in other words, let people speak all they want. By telling them not to pass racist comments, they will tell you something like "also got some malays say racist thing to me leh".<br><br>So just let it be.</blockquote>The attitude of "letting it be" smacks of sweeping things under the carpet.

            <div class='col-md body'>As a Singaporean, I really feel very upset reading comments insulting the Malays and Muslims. Many of you are just listing down utter rubbish in your judgements. I am not defending the Malays, nor am I insulting them.<br><br>Let me tell you first, Malays are not "brainless", "idiotic" or "stupid". Just fyi, the story is highlighted by ST as it is one of the few rare cases of extreme poverty in Singapore. Well, if it is all too common, why would they publish such a story? This shows that maybe out of 10 Malays, only 1 or 2 do 'things without thinking through'.<br><br>From my personal experience, Malays are definitely not stupid. An amount of them are lazy, I have to agree as I, and many of you people have observed. Well, if you actually approach them and ask why, their answer will be "because of society". IF SOCIETY(U PEOPLE) INSISTS that they are simply useless, of course they will be. The mentality to many is, why even bother is someone, in this case, a whole society labels him as useless? Many Malays do make an effort to rise, but their minds are too full of these negative thoughts  not only from you people, but also their family members themselves. Coming from a large family, when the parents or siblings do not do well in education, they will simply think that "Aiyah, it is in my genes that i'm born stupid". But the fact that they can think that way PROVES that they are not stupid at all, they can think. What many Malays need, in my opinion, is some encouragement + a bit of force to make them start improving themselves.<br><br>For your information, the top English Language, Geography and History students in my school are Malays. Most of them did not do well in the beginning of secondary three, but with a bit of force from friends, teachers and parents, they all shot up to become A1 students. It merely proves that Malays are not stupid.<br><br>Some of you complain that your tax dollars are spent in feeding them. Please, reflect upon yourselves, how inhumane you are. Now, we don't know why that family is not doing well in the first place. It is again, unfair for you to judge without knowing the full picture. But what's done is done. The couple's children did not have a choice in being born. Please, have some pity. They don't even have a house for goodness sake, and they are paying for their parent's mistakes. I'm sure that the least we can do is provide them with food and education. You see, if they read this thread, they will be demoralized and become as what i have mentioned in the first paragraph.<br><br>To summarize, the Malays are how they are because of their social problems, but the some members of other racial groups who judge and comment without thinking are not helping them raise their status quo at all. And I believe that if Singapore should fall one day, it would be because of these racial problems that seem to be expanding. Ten years ago, we wouldn't be hearing much of these rambling and rants to begin with.<br><br>My post has no intentions of being racist in any way.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>there are some who leave it to God to decide how many children they will have.  they do not practice and believe in contraception.  'Gods will'.  However they fail to think the consequences once they have many children.  The quality of life that their children received when they arrived in this world.  What happen when these children grow up?  They become delinquent, drug addicts, gangsters, prostitutes and a burden to the society.  So please, think more than leave everything to God.</div>
