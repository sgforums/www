Oh well we are all humans, humans make mistakes regardless of race or religion.. How many times have I already seen threads and posts discriminating malays and muslims and malaysians and for that fact, other races too.. Time and time again it keeps coming..

If one race is holding back the growth of the rest of the country then i'm sure there would be a lack of good sentiment toward that race. Tolerance at best but not harmony.<br><br>It is also human nature to compete. And it is only with competition that there can be progress. No one is slinging mud at malays because of their color. But more because of their poor performance in society. But perhaps i speak only for myself when i say that.<br><br>The malay community is catching up but this is also partly a result of concerted government efforts to help them. Singapore surely cannot afford a repeat of the 1960 racial riots. And sometimes minority races are so quick to scream discrimination when things dont go their way.<br><br>I am sure many singaporeans are of my mindset. It is just that most educated singaporeans are also the biggest hypocrites ever. And so they must maintain an air of caring for fellow singaporeans, regardless of race or religion. And so while they might not say it, they think it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>while there is no law to stop people from having a lot of children, it is the responsibility of the individual to live within their means.  one basic question when you do family planning - can you afford to pay for the household maintenance fees if you have <span style="font-style: italic;">x</span> number of children?  A simple answer like "Oh, we will just eat less, travel less, spend less" is not enough.  You really got to put on paper how much you  and your spouse earn and how much the two of you must spend (e.g. transport, insurance, makan, household bills and others) and then work out the remainder to see if they are sufficient for additional family members.</div>
