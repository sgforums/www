            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by simnatic:</div><div class="quote_body">As a Singaporean, I really feel very upset reading comments insulting the Malays and Muslims. Many of you are just listing down utter rubbish in your judgements. I am not defending the Malays, nor am I insulting them.<br><br>Let me tell you first, Malays are not "brainless", "idiotic" or "stupid". Just fyi, the story is highlighted by ST as it is one of the few rare cases of extreme poverty in Singapore. Well, if it is all too common, why would they publish such a story? This shows that maybe out of 10 Malays, only 1 or 2 do 'things without thinking through'.<br><br>From my personal experience, Malays are definitely not stupid. An amount of them are lazy, I have to agree as I, and many of you people have observed. Well, if you actually approach them and ask why, their answer will be "because of society". IF SOCIETY(U PEOPLE) INSISTS that they are simply useless, of course they will be. The mentality to many is, why even bother is someone, in this case, a whole society labels him as useless? Many Malays do make an effort to rise, but their minds are too full of these negative thoughts  not only from you people, but also their family members themselves. Coming from a large family, when the parents or siblings do not do well in education, they will simply think that "Aiyah, it is in my genes that i'm born stupid". But the fact that they can think that way PROVES that they are not stupid at all, they can think. What many Malays need, in my opinion, is some encouragement + a bit of force to make them start improving themselves.<br><br>For your information, the top English Language, Geography and History students in my school are Malays. Most of them did not do well in the beginning of secondary three, but with a bit of force from friends, teachers and parents, they all shot up to become A1 students. It merely proves that Malays are not stupid.<br><br>Some of you complain that your tax dollars are spent in feeding them. Please, reflect upon yourselves, how inhumane you are. Now, we don't know why that family is not doing well in the first place. It is again, unfair for you to judge without knowing the full picture. But what's done is done. The couple's children did not have a choice in being born. Please, have some pity. They don't even have a house for goodness sake, and they are paying for their parent's mistakes. I'm sure that the least we can do is provide them with food and education. You see, if they read this thread, they will be demoralized and become as what i have mentioned in the first paragraph.<br><br>To summarize, the Malays are how they are because of their social problems, but the some members of other racial groups who judge and comment without thinking are not helping them raise their status quo at all. And I believe that if Singapore should fall one day, it would be because of these racial problems that seem to be expanding. Ten years ago, we wouldn't be hearing much of these rambling and rants to begin with.<br><br>My post has no intentions of being racist in any way.</div></blockquote>X2<br><br>There are blacksheep in every single ethnicity as there are morons.<br><br>Definition of success means differently to people. Some cultures like the idea of a wholesome family life while some cultures like education and material wealth. I have malay friends who studied with me , liked the idea of starting a family after they got their degree. To them , family life is important and they like the idea of having their very own family. Is one wrong from the other? No.<br><br>Malays are very tight knit as a community and they are very lovely people. My mom (chinese btw) was admitted to hospital in Singapore with her children in Australia and my father working . The family of a malay patient actually FELT sorry for her that no one was visiting her during the afternoon. They made my mom felt like she was a family friend during her admission even though they were strangers to her and she a stranger to them.<br><br>I met Bruneian, Singapoean and Malaysian Malays who are actually damn smart. They come over to Australia to study for their Masters and PhD . They don't need prodding - they do equally well as their chinese/indian counterparts.<br><br>The family who is in this predicament ,without looking at their race, - they need help now. Yes it might have not been feasible to have 10 kids in their situation but it is  now done . No use crying over spilt milk.<br><br>I think the issue now is providing an education for their children so that they do not get trapped into the cycle of poverty and they will have an opportunity for skill training or further academic advancements. Once kids are educated , they look at their parents' mistakes and they won't make the same one again because they have lived through the consequences.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When parents encourage siblings to compete fiercely against one another they could end up not liking each other.The Garmen is something like that Those people who are here to make racists remarks are equally aware that Malays are catching up fast with the rest in SIngapore and perhaps they are not comfortable with that.In this forum we are all rascists but no need to vent your hatred and anger in here.</div>
