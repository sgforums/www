              <div>Dear Women,</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>If you've ever said, "Don't think I'm going to be easy, I am not that loose" to a man, please listen, and listen good.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Now this may come as a shock to you, but we men think logically. That is, if you say, "Don't think I'm going to be easy, I am not that loose", the only thing we can think is that you're going to be an "intentionally difficult" lay. Now as for some of my more economic peers, this also says, "You're going to have to spend a lot of time and money to get inside of me." </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>If Girls= Time * Money</div>
              <div>and, as we all know, Time=money. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>And if time is money...</div>
              <div>Money*Money=Money^2</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>And then, as money is the root of all evil:</div>
              <div>vMoney^2= Evil</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Hence, Girls=Evil.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>But that's an old joke, and I don't particularly remember where it's from...Nevertheless, girls, if you want to keep a guy who is considered a "player" around, simply don't put out until you feel ready.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>If it just so happens that after a bottle of vodka and a good 15-minute conversation that it feels ready, then so be it. Spread your legs. Finger yourself. Lick your juices off of your fingers. Moan a little. Whatever.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>You've just got to keep in mind that even the best of "players" requires a gradual decrease in sexual activity and usual withdrawl from the wallet. In Layman's terms: stop being a fucking cocktease and expect things to work out...some of us are too broke for twenty dates before we can get action. Increase your standards a little for him, sure; but don't lock up your pussy and eat your key.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Let me eat your pussy and lock my key...in your hole.</div>
              <div><br></div>

              <p>In this world we have a choice.</p>
              <p>You want pretty girl? Be ready to become sugar daddy. Spend all your money. I used to date chio bu at school because they were easier to sweet talk and bribe with sweets and cheap jewellery for some necking knick knacks. Nowadays, chio bu are demanding, everytime you go out with them, expect to spend $100 perdate (high maintenance). For me, go to geylang is a better deal. So I prefer the moderate looking, more homely and caring girl who is has wife-potential qualities.</p>
              <p>You want a moderate looking girl with more caring heart? Work harder to search for them.</p>
              <p>Its your choice.</p>
