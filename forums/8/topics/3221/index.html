            <div class='col-md body'>To Diabolo,<br><br>Well, you can satisfy the first two conditions and she is not the one, because she is not permanently going to be with you. My last ex-gf fulfil the last two conditions and we failed to hit the third one.. So, every r/s is a bet.. Whether you want to gamble, and it's your choice.<br><br>Let the gal decide then in your case... Hope you would be luckier than me then...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ohhhh, always ask myself this all-important question.   :p  HOw would we know if the other is the one? Sorry folks, we don't. There's no guarantee in this world that we meet someone and ta da!  my future permanent partner forever is standing right in front of moi.<br><br>Ironically, like xue,i believe that there's someone out there for me. My soulmate.  Unfortunately, he probably won't appear with words engraved on his head declaring so.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>We are basing our choices on our instincts and emotions. Subjectively, not objectively. Thus, there's no right or wrong.  We just have to follow our heart.  Anyway, often those that we feel so right at the start turn out to be oh-so wrong at the end right? *gRinz*</div>
