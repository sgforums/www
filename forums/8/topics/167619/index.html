Usually experienced agents would print a lot of coloured flyers and distribute them in letter boxes.  The newbies would want to penetrate the market and they thought owners would be tricked into thinking that they are buyers and call them so that they would be able to get listings.<br><br>Buyers would not spend time, money and effort in printing 'ah beng' flyers. In reality, buyers don't mind spending a little money to look for an agent to serve them. Save them a lot of hassle from having to print pieces of paper and distribute them to letter boxes. (a lot of work involved).<br><br>Also, you'll realise that the wordings of the 'ah beng' flyers are similar. This is because agents borrow ideas from others and then make some changes and print their own. Usually would be  'willing to pay $20,000 to $40,000 cash', divorce cases - needing a place to stay with parents, moving near parents to take care of kids, just sold their property &amp; finding a place to stay,<br><br>This method works best on HDB dwellers to get them to sell.<br><br>I know as I'm an real estate agent but I don't print 'ah beng' flyers.<br><br></div>
