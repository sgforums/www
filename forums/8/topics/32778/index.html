            <div class='col-md body'>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Part 1<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I met her on the net, how?<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I can't remember. but it seems to me that it is this 'little<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;theory' which I declared in the cyberspace that caught her<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;attention.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;If I have a million dollars, I would buy a house. do I have a<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;million? No. That's why I don't have a house.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;If I have wings, I can fly. do I have wings? No. so I can never<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;fly.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;If all the waters are drawn out of Pacific Ocean, but it still<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;can't put off the flame of love between us. Can all the waters of<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Pacific Ocean be drawn off? No. That's why I don't love you.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;That's me, a typical science student. First you come up with an<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;assumption, then you fit a suitable conclusion.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;If the proposed assumption doesn't stand at all, then everything<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;is just bullshit. I guess this is what they call 'unromantic'.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;But she is an exception. she actually mailed me and said that I<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;am an 'interesting' person.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;'Interesting'? What a word to use on me, it's like using<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;'faithful' on Mr. Clinton. I thought this girl must be a low-IQ<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;organism, or suffering from serious brain damage.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Anyway, her nick doesn't seems so bad -FLYINDANCE- that's quite a<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;unique one.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;But I was warning myself: hello, this is the virtual world of<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Internet. who knows what might be lurking behind a beautiful nick.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Talking from ex! perience, most of the time it will be a<br><br>'dinosaur'<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;in disguise. The only differences will be whether it is a carnivore<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;or a herbivore but, I know she is way different from a 'dinosaur',<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;she is special.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;So I guess its time for the appearance of FlyNDance.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Ever since she mailed to tell me that I am 'interesting', I was<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;always wishing to meet her in AJCRR. Too bad, lady luck was just<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;not on my side. So I can only reply her letter to tell her that I<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;will start to train myself to become an 'interesting' person, just<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;to show that she is far-sighted.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;She replied my reply, I replied her reply to my reply, she again<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;replied my reply to her reply blah blah blah... Oh no, I just<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;started a chain-reaction. Actually what interested me the most is<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;this paragraph she wrote in one of the mails....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 'I dance swiftly, amidst the crowd.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Your glance on me be it surprise,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; be it admiration, it ain't going to stop my rhythm.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Because it's not your glance that made me dance,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; it's my heart of youth.'<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I simply cannot relate this girl to any of the 'dinosaurs'. But<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;if she really is a dinosaur, I am willing to let her have her fill.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Tye, my best pal unfortunately, noticed my little affair with<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;FlyNDance, and has been perpetually warning me about this.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"HELLO! You don't even know what she looks like, why take the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;risk?? Maybe 'she' is a guy!"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I can't blame Tye for his ignorance. Ever since he was dumped by&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Sally in Secondary 4, he has become a renowned 'playboy'.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;As the saying goes: "Once bitten, Twice shy".<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;In this case, after Tye was bitten, he has mastered the art of<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;skinning snakes alive, and make them into soup. But he got all the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;factors to be a playboy, I always think he is the 19 year-old<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;version of Brad Pitt.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Tall, handsome and got this tongue that causes diabetes in every<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;women he targets. I don't think he can even remember how many<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;girlfriends he has had.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I went online that night, log onto channel AJCRR and yes!<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;She is there.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Before I can get over the surprise and the daze, she sent me a<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;message.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Hey slorr, so late liao haven't sleep ah?"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Now what? Now what? Ok ok, I had to calm down first. I swallowed<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;hard on my saliva, took a few deep breath.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Now where is that Tye when I needed him most at such crucial<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;moment, somebody to tell me what to say to her. How am I going to<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;attract her with my pathetic humour which has gone stale.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Slorr, me in a foul mood today. Can't sleep, you leh?"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;MOTHER'S (direct translation to chinese), what slorr slorr...<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Now when I read it twice in a row, I am beginning to feel<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;disgusted in that nick Tye gave me. Tye said that: "Who knows, it<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;might attract some innocent gals in talking to you."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"I am not feeling very good too. So let's s! ad together."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Finally squeezed a sentence out, but I can already feel droplets<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;of sweat forming on my forehead. Actually I am not in a bad mood, I<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;just wanna follow up her topic that's all.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;And if she ask for the reason for my feeling down, I can say:<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Since you are feeling down, how can I ever be happy?"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I know it sounds mushy, but Tye said: "MUSHINESS IS THE<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;FUNDAMENTAL TO ALL COURTSHIP."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;And gals are a very weird species, they trust their ears far more<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;than their eyes. So instead of doing 10 things to impress her, why<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;not just say a sentence to move her.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Ok, but you haven't greet me leh."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;DAMNIT!.. how can I forget simple manners to gals.

So if she doesn't has long hair, that means her skirt<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;flies when she dances, AH-HA!!.. this has a certain sexual hint in<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;it...haha.."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Eh?

Deep in the mountains,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;the guy must have long hair, gotta have the look of an artist,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;carries a sketching stand, a few pieces of drawings, and you can<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;see birds stop over at his side, admiring his work. And there will<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;be a girl whose the model, most probably naked."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"slorr, but these all very romantic mah."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"ROMANTIC?

Nope, I am just using my knowledge of statistics<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;to get a deduction, that guys must be TALL to be romantic, not<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;HANDSOME!!! Some love novels even portrayed the guy as normal<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;looking, but no-one dares to challenge the height of him!

            <div class='col-md body'>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;is the perfect location for this transformation to occur."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Slorr, you blowing cow is it?

I began to blame myself for being so perverted,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;why talk about these things?<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I should have discussed with her whether ZOE or FANN, who should<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;be the queen of Caldecott Hill. Damn that TIMES magazine, poison my<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;mind. Maybe she's lagging. so I waited... and waited. Girl its just<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;a few minutes, but it felt like several hours. I want to apologize,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;but do not know how to start. until she sent me this message:<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Slorr... let's meet..."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Without hesitation, I used the hand that I had used it over 18<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;years to wipe my ass, typed 'O-K'.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I am supposed to meet FlyNDance tonight , 8pm, at the entrance of<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;McDonalds, the one beside YMCA. That's the best time and place to<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;meet a girl you have never met before, according to Tye, 'cos they<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;would have taken their dinner by that time which means we can<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;simply go inside the Mac and have some fries and coke.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;She will be wearing a whole set of coffee theme attire and I will<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;be wearing my usual blues, this is our way of identification. she<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;told me she is not those 'cute gals' I may think she is, I said<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;nevermind, I am not Brad-pitt either. then she told me she has long<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;ago given up on this hop! e already.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Part 5<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Slorr, you are early."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;While I was idling, a girl tapped my shoulders from my back.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Although I was already mentally prepared for anything that's<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;going to appear in front of me, I was still astonished by this girl<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;who stood in front of me now.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;If not for the coffee theme and that 'Slorr', I would think she<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;is only asking for directions. She is one of those 'chio bu' that<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;can only be found on Orchard Road, which I usually see while<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;crossing the road. Maybe I suffered from a serious concussion due<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;to the heavy blow, my mind was extraordinarily calm.<br></div>

A very vague word. To many gals, decent=boring. One<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;good thing is that she didn't lie to me about the fact that she is<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;keeping long hair. She also has a fair complexion which reminds me<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;of HL milk I take almost everyday.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;It is now only that I found out she is from ACJC, but had spent<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;her first 3 mths in AJ.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Sitting in front of each other, we talk about many things. From<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;her obsession with coffee to my hobby of watching movies. BTW, she<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;had completely shook off my misconception of 'if she is pretty, she<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;is brainless'. She appears to be an attractive girl, both<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;physically and character wise, talking, smiling to me, occasionally<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;being a little sarcastic and nasty.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;It's like a dream.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;We left the Mac at around 10 pm. Since it's still early, I<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;decided to send her home and fortunately, it's just Ang Mo Kio, two<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;MRT stops from mine.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I would have second thoughts if she's staying at Pasir Ris.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Slorr, congratulations! You are officially permitted to date me<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;from now on."<br>&gt; &gt; &amp;! gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;She said this before the lift door closed.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Back at home, I realized that I hadn't asked for her real name,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;maybe it's the influence of that stupid Tye.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Tye told me :<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Never ask a pretty girl her name the first time you meet her,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;cos there are already too many wolves out there dying to know, so<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;she will be more interested in you if you act bochap.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Then why didn't she ask for mine? Don't tell me there's a female<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;version of Tye telling her not to?<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;It's again 1 am.

            <div class='col-md body'>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"You should go sleep now lah."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Wait one little while. You haven't tell me you tired or not?"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Ok lah, A bit. You leh?"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"I am exhausted but have to say good night to you first. Slorr,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;if not I can't sleep."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"me too."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I can't believe I am doing this SILLY business right now.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Ok I tell you what I count 1,2,3. Then we log off together."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"ok good night Slorr."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Same to you"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"1..."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"2..."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"3..."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Part 6<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I never talk whenever I am inside a cinema, and now is the best<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;time for my mouth to rest, so I spent the following 3 hours to<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;admire this much-talked-about movie of the century, Titanic.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I am not a romantic person, so it's perfectly understandable if I<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;can't really appreciate this motion picture fully, except for all<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;those stunning special effects. but something struck me when Jack<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;said to Rose before he sank into the deep.....<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Rose, listen to me... listen.... winning that ticket was the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;best thing that had happened to me... it broug! ht me to you....and<br><br>I<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;am thankful, Rose....I am thankful...."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Suddenly I felt much fortunate than Jack, because I don't have to<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;risk my life to board Titanic, all I have to do is to switch on my<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;PC every night.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;But he's one lucky guy too, because he knows how to draw, and<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;just look at how slowly he was drawing Rose, that made me blame<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;myself for the lack of this talent. But to her, this movie wasn't<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;just about drawings or special effects. I noticed that packet of<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;tissue paper she was holding in her hand. and just when Rose said:<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;"I promise... I will never let go, Jack... i'll never let go.."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;She opened up her sling bag and here comes the reserve<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;handkerchief. Damn that Celine Dion, why on earth did she had to<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;sing that "MY HEART WILL GO ON" at the end of the show, for all the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;female species inside the theater, its like "MY TEARS WILL ALSO GO<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;ON".<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Ok, movie ended. Let's go."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I stood up, speak to her gently, worried that every single word I<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;breathe out might just crush onto her, and kill her. she continued<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;to sit on the position, looked at me with her beautiful eyes that<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;just came back from a swim.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;After a while, she said "Slorr, movie ended, but life goes on. Am<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;I right?"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I nodded my head. But I just wished somebody might give me some<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;clue of what she was saying. Finally we managed to leave Orchard<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;cineplex, since its still early, we decided to take a walk down the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;street.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;! &gt;Along the way, she seems unusually quiet. So I guess Tye was<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;right about the 'TITANIC FLU', he said that gals often got so<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;mentally distressed after watching this show, and it's the best<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;time to launch an emotional attack on her, that's why Tye had watch<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Titanic for over 5 times roughly.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Her eyes were focussed on the path or the crowds but I know her<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;mind was still left on Titanic, sinking with her, waiting for<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;somebody to pull her up.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I just kept my mouth shut. I know I am not a good swimmer. We<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;walked to Plaza Singapura. Suddenly she stopped in front of a<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Christian Dior counter.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Slorr, have you read a novel called 'Fragrance'?"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Err..nope. Why do you ask?"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Look at this 'DOLCE VITA' from Christian Dior. It's what the guy<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;bought for her girlfriend in the story on her birthday. And he told<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;her 'DOLCE VITA' is French, meaning 'SWEET TIMES'"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;She pointed to a bottle of perfume at the counter, but I was more<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;interested at the price tag around the neck of the bottle.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Oh... is it?"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Slorr, then do you consider today as 'sweet times'?"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"At first I do, but some points are deducted since you started<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;crying."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"That means it can only be considered a little bit sweet, I'll<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;buy the small bottle then."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I insisted to pay for the perfume as her birthday present from me<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;since I know her birthday is coming soon, this kind of saves ! me a<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;lot of trouble of finding a present for her. Luckily it's just<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;perfume, or I would have to pawn my underwear if that guy in the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;story gives her girlfriend diamond or gold bar.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Are you hungry? Wanna sit down and have something?"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"I don't have appetite, what about you?"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"You eat, I eat..."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Her eyes are red again. I am such a fool. Finally got away from<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;the noisy crowd at the MRT station, walking on one of the steets of<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;AMK Ave 6. Contrastingly, it's so quiet now that I even can hear<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;the rhythm of her heartbeat."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Slorr, do you know what's the correct way of applying perfume?"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I shook my head. In fact, I had never used a perfume or cologne<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;before, medicated oil maybe.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"First you apply some behind your ears, then your neck and<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;wrists. After that spray some onto the air, then walk through it."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Sure or not?"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"In that case this little bottle won't even be able to last you<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;for 3 days"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Slorr, shall we try?"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"We? You go ahead. I am a MAN."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;She opened up that DOLCE VITA, behind her ears, neck then the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;wrist she applied some and she really did spray some onto the air!!<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;WABIANGZ!! Expensive leh! Finally she stretched out her hands,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;facing up like enjoying the raindrops fallling on her face.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Hahaha...."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;! "Slorr, this is so fun! Now its your turn."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;She went through the same procedures with me and I can feel the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;coldness of her fingers. maybe it's the perfume, I guess.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Slorr, get ready, I am going to spray!!"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I imitated her. Face up and walked through my first perfume rain.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Slorr let's have another round!!"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;" WHAT!! Serious?"<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;My money isn't easy to come by leh!! before I can collect the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;broken pieces of my heart, she had walked through her second round.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;she was even more excited this time, hoping around, like her<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;nickname. A flying and dancing butterfly. late night of AMK, the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;streets smells unusually nicer right now. until we finished the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;whole of that DOLCE VITA.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"DOLCE VITA is exhausted."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"I guess this sweet time shall end now too. Slorr, I'll go up<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;now. Tonight 1 am, I won't be online, and you are not to do so<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;too."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Huh? But why?"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Go online at 12pm tomorrow. You will know.... Remember, only<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;12pm..."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;She turned and walked into the lift. At the same time, I saw an<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;obvious pink patch behind her neck, which is visible only now<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;because she tied her hair.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I looked up towards her window on the 4th floorfrom below, but it<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;never light up.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Part 7<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I switched off the light in my room. Engulfed in the absolute<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;darkne! ss. I wished to have the same kind of feeling as her right<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;now. I realised in complete darkness, the easiest mood one gets...<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;is loneliness. she must be lonely right now, half asleep.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I almost can see a beautiful butterfly, turning to ashes amidst<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;the sea of flame. And that patch behind her neck.. from pink it<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;became red. Then burgundy. Slowly, it swallowed me was it the cause<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;of that can of beer just now?<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Suddenly I felt cold and shaky. And that coolness seemed to have<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;come straight from my heart, the rate of my heartbeat was an<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;exponential function of time as it got closer to 1 am.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;USE A DIFFERENT NICK!!<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;checked ..<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;She isn't there, my heart was beating fast. But the temperature<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;remained below healthy level....<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;-=~@~=-<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Finally its 12 pm, excited as I was, logged on the net, yet there<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;was still no sign of FlyNDance. But there's a mail from her :<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Dear slorr,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; At first I thought it will be easier for me to settle down in<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;the darkness... recollecting memories we have shared... but all I<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;felt was loneliness...... can you feel it too?...<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I still can't change the habit of logging on at 1am... so I used<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;a different nick to sneak into AJCRR... you don't blame me<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;right?...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">... you werent there... should I feel glad for your<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;obidience?.... you said both of us belonged to TYPE 2... the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;foolish type...maybe you are right!...

I started to realise<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;that you are not only a virtual being living in the cyberspace...<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;in reality you are strong, gentle and sensitive.... I can feel the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;defense Wall of my heart is slowly breaking apart.... I am<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;defeated... I tied my hair today.. 'cos my fren told me that I look<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;more attractive this way...<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I want you to remember my face as it is today...

I don't know....Good Bye.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; With lotsa love,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; FlyNDance<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;After reading her mail, I felt as if I had just experienced a<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;roller-coaster ride which almost derailed. she had shown me the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;other side of her, soft and sensitive.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;For a couple of months, I was trying to hypnotise myself, to<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;suppress my feelings whenever I started to think about her again.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Perpetually I was telling myself, she is just one virtual character<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;that flys and dance in the net, but never in the real world.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I became a fugitive, escaping from my PC, escaping from the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;internet and anythng that has to do wih coffee. Hide myself behind<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;the piles of lecture notes, behind the crowd of people, trying to<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;get rid of this thought of missing something in life.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;But I failed. I found out that its not that I don't miss her, its<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;just that I had forgotten the passion that always comes along when<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;you are having something hanging on your mind all the time. its<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;like I cannot not breathe, its just that I had forgotten the fact<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;that I have been breathing in and out for the past 19 years.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I can hold my breath for a while, but not forever.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I have to find her.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Part 8<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Err... I am looking for ... er..FlyNDance...."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"HUH??..."&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;'Huh', this is the exact word I was expecting from her.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;She seems to be FlyNDance's elder sister, 20++, looked quite a<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;beauty too even without any makeup. But of course, still can't be<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;compared with her. I explained to her my purpose for knocking on<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;the door and told her that I am no stalker whom she might think I<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;am.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Surprisingly when I told her my disgusting nick, Slorr, she<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;appeared to be rather excited and quickly she scribbled something<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;on a small piece of paper and handed it to me.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"You should go and see her. SGH, Room 3-425."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;-=~@~=-<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;This is the first time I've ever stepped into the Singapore<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;General Hospital. It's a dust-free space, everything looked so<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;clean, tidy and arranged.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;But I don't like the feeling it gave me... I entered room 3-425,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;she was there, in a deep sleep. I stood by her, watching.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Her hair was still as long as before, laying across the soft,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;white pillow...<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Her face looked roundish now, I know it's the side-effect of the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;medicine. And the pinkish-red patch that was on her neck had spread<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;to her face appearing in a shape of a butterfly.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Nevertheless, she was still the most beautiful butterfly I've<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;ever seen.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Her eyelashes twitched slightly, she must be dreaming, what's<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;that in her dream?<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;McDonald's fries and coke? Sinking Titanic? Or the rain at AMK<br>&gt; ! &gt; &gt;&gt;Ave 6? The room was getting darker as the clock approaches 6pm.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I wanted to switch on the light. I hate to see her lying lonely<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;under the shadow of a patient's room.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;But I am worried that her dreams might be disturbed by the sudden<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;light rays. While I was in a dilemma, her eyes opened slowly. Her<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;eyes were wide on me, then she turned away suddenly.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I can only see her back at this moment. She lost weight. After a<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;long time, she turned to face me again, rubbed her eyes and<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;smiled....<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Slorr, you are here!"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Yes, nice weather today, isn't it?"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Ya lor, sky also very chio today? Right? Heehee.."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;SKY VERY CHIO...<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I can still remember this was the conversation we had in one of<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;our AJCRR meetings."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;But she didn't realized that it's raining today.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Slorr, why are you standing there. Sit down."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Thanks for reminding me. I just found out that my legs were<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;numbed due to the several hours of standing.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Slorr, you lost weight."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;ME? I thought I should be the one who's telling this to her!?<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Slorr, you hungry? Had your lunch? Food here isn't so good.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;That's why patients like me always slim down a bit. Apart from<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;that. It's quite ok. But sometimes I feel really bored without a PC<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;here to talk to you.."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Slorr, how's yo! ur mid-year? Sure did very well right?"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;WAIT A MINUTE! You are the one who's lying on bed right now not<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;me! Yet, I had nothing to ask her actually.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Because I was there to see her, not to find out the answers to<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;those questions. Maybe now its the time for me to utter some<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;touching lines like whats in the case of a movie.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;But I am not a Romantic person... moreover...<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Movies are fiction.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Life isn't.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;-=~@~=-<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I just wished that she could leave this place as soon as possible<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;back to AMK Ave 6, back to ACJC, back to where she belonged. And I<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;promised she won't be alone anymore, because I will always be<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;there.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;After a while, her mum was here to see her. Around the age of 50,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;slightly overweight. Other than the cheerful smile, she didn't<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;really remind me of FlyNDance.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Err, I think i've gotta go now. Bye bye auntie."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"You....You..."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;She sat up straight in a sudden, like if she'd experienced a<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;tremendous shock.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"I'll be here again tomorrow.. and the day after tomorrow...<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;until you leave this place..."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Before I went back home, I went to Plaza Singapura again to buy<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;that Christian Dior Dolce Vita... and I've got the biggest bottle<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;this time, that she can even swim in it.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I try not to close my eyes that night, I want to go to her as<br>&gt; &amp;g! t; &gt;&gt;soon as the first sun ray shoots into my room....<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Part 9<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Slorr.. you are here.. i've been waiting for you for a long<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;time..."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Had a good night's rest?..."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Oh... I didn't allow myself to fall into a deep sleep because I<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;know you won't wake me up when your here."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Then you should take a rest now."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Err, since you are here already, I don't think I can..."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I gave her the Dolce Vita, and we'd agreed that we would dance in<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;the rain in front of SGH main entrance the day she's discharged.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I dare not look straight at her, because there's a butterfly on<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;her face. It was only last night before I leave SGH that I found<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;out she's suffering from an illness called ERYSIPELAS. What the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;clergymen would term the BUTTERFLY DISEASE...<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;But what I like is the coffee butterfly that is able to dance<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;around freely, not that pinkish-red butterfly that settled on her<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;pale complexion. Moreover, whats a butterfly if it can't fly?<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Slorr, why are you looking at me and not talking?"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I don't know, because I noticed that she's getting weaker<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;physically. I had a bad feeling about this.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Slorr, I am thirsty, can you get me a drink?"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I am not leaving her at this moment. I can still remember a movie<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;about this guy who went all the way to get red bean soup for his<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;! ;girlfriend who's on sickbed and to find her lying silently on the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;white bedsheet when he came back... never to wake up again...<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Are you trying to get rid of me, like what's in that movie?"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Slorr, movie is movie, life is life..."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;MOVIE? LIFE?....<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"But I thought you just had a drink? Anyway, so what can I get<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;for you?"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Ultimate Ice Blended!!"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;This is a hospital leh!! Did she think I can find Coffee Bean<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;everywhere on this island? Like McDonalds, what's more coffee<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;wasn't suitable for her at that time.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Err... coffee isn't good for health, order something else, ok?<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"So you know coffee isn't good for the body too. Then you should<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;cut down on your intake also, ok?"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I saw her smile appearing and there's a shine in her eyes. I<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;realised that shes just trying to tell me not to drink too much<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;coffee in the future.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;My heart seemed to have suffered from a heavy blow.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;This is not good. A taste of pH7 has started to fill my nose. If<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;this is not going to stop, tears might be the next thing that<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;appears in front of her.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I recalled the chapter on reservoir and dam in physics textbook.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Quickly applied the knowledge on myself. Even if it's just a few<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;droplets.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Ok, I promise, I'll try my best."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"And try to sleep earlier in the future and don't skip<br>&gt; &gt;! &gt;&gt;breakfast..."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"It'ss important to you and don't be too obsessed with blue. It<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;makes you look troubled and....."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;This didn't sound good. It's like giving the final instructions<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;before she... I can't bear to let her continue.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Ok ok, I'll go get you a drink right away."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Slorr, is the machine far away? If it is, then its ok, I don't<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;want it anymore."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;From my mental calculation, men would take 67 steps while women<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;would take 85 steps to reach the vending machine right at that<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;corner. Plus the time taken to purchase, average would take a total<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;of 1.8 to 2.1 minutes. Not very far.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Quite near."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Slorr, come back quick. I don't want to be alone for too long...<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;I hate that feeling."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I didn't answer her. I just increased my pace....<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Part 10<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Eh... its late already... go to sleep..", my mum was nagging at<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;me again.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Ok ok.... 10 more minutes..."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Until today, FlyNDance had left for more than 2 mths.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I still logged on at 1 am every night, but onto channel<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;DOLCE-VITA which was created by myself, with slorr and FlyNDance<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;being the only 2 nicks inside, for 10 minutes.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Although she won't be able to fly and dance in real life anymore,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;but I still wish that she could continue to do so in the virtual<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;world.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>&gt; &amp;g! t; &gt;&gt; &gt;Even Tye has given up on me...<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"She's gone, why are you still doing this? For what?!!"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Yet, even if that's the case, I can't allow her soul to be left<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;at the corner of loneliness. Because she said she hated the feeling<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;of being alone....<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I still remember there was a heavy downpour on that day. When I<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;reached SGH, they told me... A coffee butterfly flew away from her<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;room at around 1 am last night....<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;After that... I can't remember...<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I just knew that I stood at the bus-stop for a whole day and I<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;was all wet because of the rain. even my face.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I've been trying hard not to think of her over these 2 months.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;I've been hoping that her face won't appear in my mind every moment<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;that I breathe, but it's like hoping that the sky isn't blue; the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;grass isn't green; the stars do not twinkle at night...<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Basically, I was hoping for something impossible to happen. I<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;can't believe that I am of Type 2, even in real life.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Did I cry?.. NO WAY!..<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I said it before, I am not a romantic person, and this may be due<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;to the deficiency in the hormones that constitutes emotions.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Whenever I had the feeling of pH7, I'll browse through those<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;'FWDS:jokes...' Attention will then be shifted by those dim-wit,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;low-class jokes...<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;So now everything is back to the way it was before I met her 9<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;mths ago.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Tye is still flirting around, and I am st! ill the old decent=dull<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;me. But I've stopped taking coffee and beer.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"Xing ah, is this for you?"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;My mum handed me a letter she picked up in the mail box this<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;morning.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I was surprised when I saw 'To:slorr...' written on the envelope.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;That's for me I guess. I opened it up, there was a piece of<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;writing inside, and another coffee envelope.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Slorr,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I am FlyNDance's sister, I think this is how you are addressing<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;her. I am sorry that I do not know your real name, although we'd<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;met before.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; When I was packing her stuffs a few days ago, I found this<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;letter with your name and address already written on it.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; So I posted it to you, because I believe this is what my sister<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;intended to do.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Best wishes,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Xiao Wen<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;The letter was sent 3 days ago, and there was another:<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 'To:slorr...'<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Followed by my home address written on the coffee envelope. But<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;this handwriting was a lot nicer and the words seemed to be moving<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;swiftly...like in a joyful dance.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I have no time to figure out how she has gotten my home address.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Did I give her in one of my mails?<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I tried to control my trembling hands, slowly, I opened up the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;envelope. I found a photo, and a half of a movie ticket inside.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Apart from these, there was a blue letter... with the familiar<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;DOLCE VITA smell on it. The photo showed her, standing on a piece<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;of grassland, wearing the same coffee theme attire on our first<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;meeting at McDonalds.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Something was written at the back of it....<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Dear slorr,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Coffee represents Pisces.. that's me. Blue represents<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Sagitarius.. that's you. A blue letter inside a coffeee<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;envelope.... know what I mean? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Seeing me, do you feel like drinking coffee now? Stop drooling!<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; FlyNDance<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I smiled.... bitterly. The contents of the blue letter is simple:<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; If I have one more day to live, I want to be your girlfriend. Do<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;I have one more day? No. Too bad. I can't be your girlfriend... not<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;in this life.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; If I have wings, I want to fly down from the paradise just to<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;see you. Do I have wings? No. Sadly. I can never see you again.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; If all the water are drawn out of the bath-tub, but it still<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;can't put off the flame of love btw us. Can all the water in a<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;bath-tub be drawn off? Can.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; So yes. I LOVE YOU.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; FlyNDance<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;My chest was torn apart... tears broke through the dam I<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;constructed a long time go in a jiffy.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;As proud, as emotionless as I was, I can't pull back the salty<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;wetness that's on the whole ! of my face anymore.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;She has changed my 'little theory' and gotten back what I'd owed<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;her... tears for 2 months....<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;-=~@~=-<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Titanic has won 11 awards in the Oscar, including best picture.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Yet, Rose wasn't the best actress under that category. So if it's<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;sad in a movie, it may not be so fortunate too in real life. And in<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;reality, should Jack hold on to Rose and 'Never let go?'<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Maybe he shouldn't be worried about this. 'Cos that beautiful<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;coffee butterfly will continue to fly and dance in his heart..<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;forever...'<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;~THE END~<br></div>
