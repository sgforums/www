IMAGINE going through all the paperwork and such... The TIME wasted... The COURT sessions... ADDITIONAL EXPENSES on LAWYER... And at the end of the day you lose your case (Justice is not always there... That day not Sunday?), WHERE would you stand...?<br>Putting my example into the UNIFIED SYSTEM... Yes... It's CONVENIENT... But slowly you'll become UNAWARE of your expenses... You no longer monitor them like you used to... (Need to top up cash, pay $$$, pay bills, check bank account... etc.) Maybe they should suggest having something like a watch to wear on your hand so that you can monitor your account and spending..? Well.. But that's not exactly my point yet...? Ever experienced farecard spoilt, farecard machine spoilt.... Faulty cards... And such...? What happens then? You find ALTERNATIVEs.... With an unified system you usually DON'T HAVE ALTERNATIVES.... Not like I want it to sound even WORSE... But imagine NOT being able to do payment or even buy food due to system error and fault chip..? Longer waiting time due to technical fault (no alternatives what...? So have to wait lor...) And a place like Singapore...? DON'T you feel CONTROLLED enough..? ~Sigh..~ I don't mind if I've only got a few more years to live lah....<br>More questions... Your friend use your hand to pay, does that count? And now they would have to chop off your hand in order to 'rob' you...? ~Sigh...~ What a RUBBISH WORLD!</div></blockquote>My point here is: when such a cashless system arrives, you have no choice but to accept it.<br>Years ago with the introduction of ATM card, people fear about having the ATM card spoilt, malfunctioning , fear loosing the money balance when the card spoil or fear the ATM card being stolen or robbed. But still we are forced to use it in our society.<br>Now today almost everyone is using ATM already.<br><br>Years ago people fear that if we put too much money in Transit Link Card, if we loose the card the money is gone so people rather choose to use coin.<br>But now everybody still use the TransitLink card.<br>Why dont they fear the card malfunctioning and unable to board the MRT/Bus then? Can you tell me?<br>And how did they manage to monitor the account in their ATM card and Transit link cashcard when it is just a card? Can you tell me this too?<br><br>Just remind you that such kind of technology cannot suit everyone's need and make everyone happy but YET all are forced to use when it is implemented in the society. You just have no choice.<br><br>Even possible is that the Mark of the Beast may not even be the one that keep track of your account. It may be something that you need to produce as a pass in order to buy or sell and your account is seperated in another database, so you will not fear your hand being chopped off by robbers.<br><br>The Bible warned people of this Mark of the Beast coming and never put in detail how it work so I wont know how this Mark of the Beast will work out exactly.<br>Untill the day comes, I will not know (IF ever the day comes in your context). So far I am just giving you the signs that already showed us some technology that can make our life miserable if we dont have it - and they are pointing to the coming of this cashless system , either accept it or reject it with your life miserable.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rapture (edited 01 March 2002).]</div>

How come u also sounded so negative???<br><br>There are engineers called Test Engineers and Process Engineers and Industrial Engineers and ....<br><br>They are here to troubleshoot your problems. Every system got limitations, but fear not...<br>Human brains can conquer all these in the time to come.<br>Eg. The brick-size handphone is reduced by at least 1000% to the present Nokia size in just less than 10 years!!!<br><br>Unless u are 70 years old or planning not to live that long. Another 20 years may be juz the time when such things happen to us.<br>THis is only a conservative calculation....<br></div>
