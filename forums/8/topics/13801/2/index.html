If you can READ every soldiers' movement (Or MAJORITY's) then that's IT liao... Or how about 'FORCE CONTROL' over individuals for the TRUE OWNER or DESIGNER of the CHIP? Hmm... Sounds TOO FICTION?

You still can pay cash NOW for taking Bus but you would be miserable to carry coins everyday with you. Sooner or later they will disallow paying cash to take the bus - consider that how many people do you see everyday actually pay cash to take the SBS bus? Even old aunties and old uncles are now using cash cards.<br>You can try taking cab everyday and make yourself miserable also if you dont mind paying 10 times more. Soon when the chips are implemented into the society, even the cab will have to accept the chip to adopt the paying system to suit the society.<br><br>That's why the arrival of the Mark of the Beast is just a matter of time - either you accept it into your life, or reject it and make yourself MiserabLe.<br><br>so now, do you still think it sounds too FICTION?<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rapture (edited 01 March 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just to remind you, now there's is already an existing cashless system in Singapore which is not that obvious ==&gt;<br><br>1. Some people get their pay when the company put the sum of money into their bank<br>2. These people uses the Cash-topping machine in MRT stations to top up their credits using their transit link card and Nets<br>3. They take bus/MRT without paying cash also, they just insert the transitlink card into the paying machine<br>4. The SBS bus company recieves the amount of credit from each bus and pays tax to the government through GIRO<br>5. Then the government pays their workers by putting a sum of money into their bank again<br>6. These workers pay their their phone bills and electricity bills through NETS/ GIRO BACK to the Government<br><br>etc<br>etc<br><br>From the above you can see, This cycle already exists in the Singapore Society and NOT a single cent was used at all throughout.<br>It is already a Cashless Cycle. AND this cycle is broadening itself EVERYDAY.<br><br>years ago you can only pay bills by going to POST office with cash.<br>But Now you can pay through GIRO, worse of all, there's a NEW machine where you can pay Internet Bills, Electricity Bills, Phone Bills, Singtel Bills, M1 or Starhub Bills, ETC ETC through NETS. That machine just came out not long ago, I think you guys know what I am talkng about.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rapture (edited 01 March 2002).]</div>

IMAGINE how much it would COMPLICATE things and how much more UNJUSTICE would be written over this SOCIETY...? SYMBOL of the BEAST? You've GOT IT....</div></blockquote>The Mark of the Beast is not the technology of chip implantation, neither is it the act of receiving an implantation. AND definitely not the "disadvantages" of having an implantation.<br><br>The Mark of the Beast is build upon the chip technology. Above all these, it is a biblical symbolism of a person voluntarily rejecting Christ and accept the rule of the ultimate leader (which I have mentioned during one of the post toking about the merger of S'pore and Thailand econ.)<br>That guy will be an anti-christian and he will genocide all christians. So to me, it make sense that this Mark of the Beast refers to a certain "program" that enables money transactions. And for christians, they will be barred from using this mark (unless they deny Jesus Christ), hence killing them by starvation etc.<br><br>The Mark of the Beast is NOT a reversible process. Once received, no way one can accept God again (Forgot which verse in the Bible). Many will reject God at this stage even when the prophecy is fulfilled.<br><br>[This message has been edited by MCD (edited 01 March 2002).]</div>

I think there really have to be a BALANCE for such things before a UNIFICATION....<br>No doubt having ONLY ONE cashing system would make our day MORE CONVENIENT... Just like having a CREDIT CARD... It has its CONVENIENCE, it has its PRICE too... HIGH INTEREST RATE and UNREASONABLE CHARGING when ERROR form up during billing... People used to say "Don't overspend lor.." "Be careful lor.." But MY POINT is... When such things actually HAPPEN to you, I can ASSURE you you won't be the one putting on that smiling face... IMAGINE going through all the paperwork and such... The TIME wasted... The COURT sessions... ADDITIONAL EXPENSES on LAWYER... And at the end of the day you lose your case (Justice is not always there... That day not Sunday?), WHERE would you stand...?<br>Putting my example into the UNIFIED SYSTEM... Yes... It's CONVENIENT... But slowly you'll become UNAWARE of your expenses... You no longer monitor them like you used to... (Need to top up cash, pay $$$, pay bills, check bank account... etc.) Maybe they should suggest having something like a watch to wear on your hand so that you can monitor your account and spending..? Well.. But that's not exactly my point yet...? Ever experienced farecard spoilt, farecard machine spoilt.... Faulty cards... And such...? What happens then? You find ALTERNATIVEs.... With an unified system you usually DON'T HAVE ALTERNATIVES.... Not like I want it to sound even WORSE... But imagine NOT being able to do payment or even buy food due to system error and fault chip..? Longer waiting time due to technical fault (no alternatives what...? So have to wait lor...) And a place like Singapore...? DON'T you feel CONTROLLED enough..? ~Sigh..~ I don't mind if I've only got a few more years to live lah....<br>More questions... Your friend use your hand to pay, does that count? And now they would have to chop off your hand in order to 'rob' you...? ~Sigh...~ What a RUBBISH WORLD!<br></div>
