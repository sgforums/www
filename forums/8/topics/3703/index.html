            <div class='col-md body'>The funniest thing is not about masturbation. I am not afraid to admit that I do it - not on regular basis of course. I am sure other guys and gals do it too - bedroom, bathroom, park, etc.<br><br>The best part is that u catch yur friend in the act.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> The other time I went on a Business Trip with one of my female colleagues. Obviously, we stayed in seperate rooms. I chose to have a sudden idea for the proposal and brust into my colleague's room (her room happened not to be locked)...<br><br>She sat up in bed quickly (naked, legs wide open and wet fingers) with BIG eyes staring at me!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> She grabbed hold of her clothes, covered herself and asked me what I want.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Blushing, I shook my head, shut the door and returned to my room - thinking: 'I should have brought my camera along!'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Due to the lost idea, we subsequently lost the contract to another company and got a railing from my boss.

            <div class='col-md body'>Believe me, catching a gal in the act of masturbation isn't a very nice thing to do. Especially if she isn't your gf.<br><br>My inital reaction was surprise (to see her naked), then turn on (seeing her on the bed naked and legs wide open, fingers wet) after that turn off (cause she's not my gf and might sue me for rape if I had a go with her or land a palm on my face if I ask her for sex).<br><br>Well tokunaga, it's quite true that gals are more 'submissive' when it comes to sex. There are exceptional ones who will make your eyes pop out and rock the balls off you!<br><br>Good for you gluteus21. Indeed masturbation DO have it's own merits. Gfs are somebody to be respected and loved. If you wanna make em your sex partner - then it's sorry, go to Desker/Geylang for some paid relief.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
