The WAIS is biased because you'd need to know English, have had basic education in mathematics and lived in a country with snow to have an even chance.  Did someone say Raven's matrices?  Biased against women on the visuospatial ability count.  Bottom line, it's a whole load of bovine excrement any way you cut it.<br><br>Secondly, there's the matter of IQ score distributions, which are based around a mean of 100, with standard deviations of 15.  Given the normal distribution, anything above 165 represents such a tiny number that unless you had census data on every single person within that range, the probability of getting any particular score in that range would be about as reliable as flipping a coin.<br><br>Most important is the fundamental flaw of classical test theory, employed by the Stanford-Binet, WAIS and their clones.  How does one determine if a test item is indeed representative of a 50-year-old's level of function?  The obvious answer is to test a bunch of 50-year-old individuals to see how many of them can get the answer right.  However, this raises an interesting conundrum.  How do you know that this group of 50-year-olds is representative of all 50-year-olds?  The answer depends on their performance on the test items, but the test items are themselves an unknown measure - after all, you started out trying to find out how tough the questions were in the first place.<br><br>We therefore have a vicious cycle of working out how tough the question is based upon how many people of a certain group could get the answer right, and conversely working out how bright this group is, which in turn is influenced by how tough the question is.<br><br>Now, theoretically, there is a way out of this in the form of Item Response Theory.
