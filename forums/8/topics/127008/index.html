The Churel attempts to dry the blood of the men of the family. The Churel were generally extremely ugly vampires with sagging breasts, black tongues, thick, rough lips, wild hair and back-to-front feet. They were thought to be bitter and angry due to their untimely death and as a result attacked their families and attractive, young men. In western India the Churel was also known as a Jakhin, Jakhai, Mukai, Nagulai and Alvantin</strong><br><br>Comments: This is probably India's version of the vampire "Pontianak" commonly featured in malay folklore,probably one of the most terrifying Reports of this creature are especially prevalent in South India.A true case in documents how a corpse of a woman was found with its feet out of place.In some south Indian cultures, a practice of erecting blessed stonehenge-like structures at the entrances of villages is commonplace to prevent this creature from returning from the dead<br><br><img src="http://scd.mm-a.yimg.com/image/800104962"><br><strong>Kali: Vampire from ancient times possessed a terrifying countenance and was said to appear on battlefields during long and bloody wars . Her skin was charred black in tone, her eyes and eyebrows were blood red and she had an extremely long tongue with which she became drunk on the blood of her victims.She had mutiple arms with an assortment of weapons</strong><br><br>Comments: This one is probably the best known of them all and has made some notable appearances in novels, movies and games like Indian Jones and Temple of Doom.Its actually a deity which some Hindus pray to and deeply rooted in Indian culture since ancient times.Often said to represent violence and destruction,she's usually seeked out by religious cult groups and warlords..Cult groups around the world from western countries to Japan have been associated with this goddess ..Certain Indian homes in Singapore have her as their deity in their homes for reasons unknown.The temple in Serangoon Road is dedicated to this deity .A famous case in Singapore involving a murder case of 2 children perpertrated by a Chinese revolves around this entity<br><img src="http://scd.mm-c.yimg.com/image/313954428"><br><strong>Punyaiama: The Punyaiama (pure race) looks like an old woman. It passes a magic thread down a chimney and sucks the blood from the sleeping or mad/drunk women.It attacks travelers at night as they pass by the burial grounds in which this female vampire hides, sleeping by day in a funeral pyre. The ash from this pyre is what gives this vampire her black-skinned appearance. It is also reported to be a cannibal.</strong><br><br>Comments: Usually associated with practioners of witchcraft.Terrifying reports of this creature seems to emote from the rogue states of Bihar and Orissa.This extremely remote regions are largely ignored , teeming with cultural sins that could bring about the moral decay of a society and one of the poorest states where the very fabric of the human psyche is put to the test.In some instances hunting expeditions are sent out to seek and kill this creature<br><br><img src="http://scd.mm-b.yimg.com/image/191275004"><br><strong>Brahmaparus: This bloodthirsty monsters took ghoulish delight in completely consuming the people they attacked. Their method of devouring its victims was highly ritualized: the Brahmaparush would begin by drinking the blood through a hole in the skull, following that the brain would also be consumed. This feeding ritual would not be complete until the vampires performed a macabre dance whilst deliberately entangled in the intestines of the corpse they had destroyed.</strong><br><br>Comments: The source of this creature is associated with ritualistic cannibals who seem to hide in the forested regions of central India where crime is rampant.Often said to be ocstrasised by society, they prey on travellers and unsuspecting victims of nearby villages .Some conflicting reports have suggested that wanted terrorists or criminals hiding in the forests who manslaughter innocent villagers make up for some of these reports. Often bodies were found badly mutilated and local police disbelieving these myths and superstitions often send out armed convoys.On one occasion, a military convoy found evidence of mutilated body parts indicating a ritual.<br><img src="http://scd.mm-b.yimg.com/image/1215843800"><br><strong>Hanh Saburo: Indian forest vampires, which can control dogs. They will attempt to lure or drive travelers into the forest to attack them by sounds.These creatures were supposedly invisible and at times show up as orbs or lights.They were often said to dwell on trees and thick vegetation.Usually a foul stench can be detected when one of these creatures are near</strong><br><br>Comments: The possible source of this mythical creature could probably be attributed to large lizards, amphibians or big cats.In the villagers of South India, its advised not to respond to sounds when travelling through forests at night. Large toads or lizards could be picked up by dogs who attempt to investigate and in turn lead their owners astray...There have been cases where children were found mutilated and hung on trees probably by animals like the Cheetah<br></div>
