            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.auto-ordnance.com/images/model1921.gif"><br><br>Model 1921<br>Colt-made Thompson submachine gun, Model of 1921, with buttstock detached. (George Goll) The first production model was the Model 1921. A distinctive change was the elimination of the barrel jacket to protect the shooter's hands which was used on earlier models. All later model Thompsons assume the characteristic appearance of the Model 1921. Components for the Model 1921 were manufactured in a single lot which would equal 15,000 guns. This was probably due to anticipated fast sale of the new gun. The Model 1921 never sold in great quantities to any purchaser and was not adopted by military forces although tests were conducted in Belgium and England.<br><br><img src="http://www.auto-ordnance.com/images/model1923.gif"><br><br>Model 1923 Thompson Gun<br>This model was an abortive attempt to use a cartridge with better ranges up to 650 yards. The cartridge used was the .45 Remington-Thompson, bullet weight of 250 grains reaching a muzzle velocity of 1,450 feet per second. The cyclic rate of fire for this model was reported to be 400 rounds per minute. The 1923, called the "Military Model," offered a horizontal forearm, detachable stock and sling swivels. A biped and bayonet were optional accessories. Sales were negligible and this model and ammunition are valued collectors items today.<br><br><img src="http://www.auto-ordnance.com/images/model1927.gif"><br><br>Model 1927<br>Thompson Semi-automatic Carbine, identical in appearance with the submachine gun. (George Goll) This model is simply the Model 1921 restricted to semi-auto fire. The action and magazines are the same as the Model 1921 and by the time it appeared on the market, a 100-round drum was available.<br><br><img src="http://www.auto-ordnance.com/images/model1928.gif"><br><br>Model 1928<br>Thompson submachine gun, U.S. Navy Model of 1928, with Cutts compensator. (George Goll) In a catalog published by Auto-Ordnance in the 1930's this model is referred to as the "Navy Model," .45 caliber. The U.S. Navy ordered 500 of this model and helped keep struggling company alive. It was used by U.S. Marines in Nicaragua and was described as very effective in the jungle fighting. The catalog also notes this gun was then in use by the Army, Navy and Coast Guard. The "Navy Model" utilizes the horizontal foregrip, compensator and sling swivels although it was offered either with vertical or horizontal foregrip, with or without the compensator. The cyclic rate of fire was reduced to 700 rounds per minute.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

They can make charms out of small yellow pieces of paper with writing in chicken blood that totally immobilize a vampire or ghoul when affixed to its forehead. Just don't tease the vampire, I know the temptation is huge but don't, because if that paper falls off, you have a deadly undead creature in your face again. Also stock up on uncooked sticky rice (not regular rice, that stuff don't work), dried red beans, and garlic because vampires hate this stuff.<br></div>
