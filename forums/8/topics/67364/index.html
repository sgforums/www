            <div class='col-md body'>Why do people gossip? Could it be that we think we make ourselves look better and gain greater acceptance with peers? Does confidential infomation make us feel important, more knowledgeable or superior so surely people will listen to us? Have you been jealous of somebody's achievements or the attention they receive, and by pointing out their weaknesses you look a little better? If somebody has injured us, how easy it is to put them in a bad light as a way of retaliating and balancing the scales. Gossip can also be used to win others to our side of a conflict. There is a tendency to think that the more people we can get to agree with us, the healthier our self-worth.<br><br>No matter what reason we give, there is no reason to gossip!<br><br>There is a legend about a person who went to the village priest for advice after repeating some slander about a friend and later finding out it wasn't true. He asked the priest what he could do to make amends for his thoughtless act.<br><br>The priest told the man:"If you want to make peace with yourself, you must fill a bag with feathers, and go to every door in the village, dropping a feather on each porch."<br><br>The peasant found a bag, filled it with feathers, and made his way throughout the village doing as he was told to do. He then returned to the priest and asked:"What else can I do?"<br><br>"There is one more thing," responded the priest, "take your bag and gather up every feather."<br><br>The peasant reluctantly began his quest to gather all the feathers he had distributed. Hours later he returned, saying,"I could not find all the feathers, for the wind had blown them away."<br><br>The priest responded, "So it is with gossip. Unkind words are easily dropped, but we can never take them back again."<br><br>The next time you are tempted to say an unkind word, possibly untrue or unflattering word about someone, ask yourrself how this information will benefit the receiver, yourself, and especially the person you are talking about. Be really clear on this one irrefutable fact: Once you say it, you can't take it back.<br><br>If you have an affinity for spreading rumors or welcoming gossip about other people, ask yourself if this is how you would want to be spoken of. Then strive to speak of others as you would want to be spoken of: only with graciousness and charity. And when you have nothing gracious or charitable to say, learn to say nothing at all.</div>
