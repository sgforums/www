            <div class='col-md body'>I can't say i don't mind at all, but sometimes you have to make some sacrifices for love.<br><br>I'll try my best to treat his child as my own, as you can't change the fact that he has a son, as long as he is true to me, i guess i can accept his everything.<br><br>I've watched a program on TV a few months back, this little boy was borned with some kind of illness as his mother is a carrier. The father actually blames his wife for everything and never at all help her go through the darkest period in her life.The little boy is his son mind you, but he can do this regardless of the fact.My point here is, it all depends on the man you chose. At the time my feeling is,love is blind,you wouldn't know wat will happen in the future, the perfect man now may turn out to be an irresponsible husband,some things in life are inevitable. Like wat many other says, marriage is like a gamble, either you win or you lose, but we can't choose not to gamble , as we don't choose love but love choose us.<br><br>------------------<br>Find time to realise that there is one person who mean so much to you, for you might wake up one morning losing that person who you thought meant nothing to you</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I will accept it as everyone has a past,but you must be prepared for the fact that the kids will takesome time adjusting to your presense as they may view it as a form of betrayal by their biological parent if suddenly a new person popped into their life as when their father left them,they had only their mum to cling on and the appearance of another man in their mum's life will suddenly appear like he is there to steal their mum away from them.But i guess when the kids get more mature and able to think rationally,it won't be so bad.Coming from a divorced family where my father left when i was a young age,i am prepared to see my mum remarry if she so do wishes,but so far she has not done so,but i sure will be able to accept it if she does so 1 day and wish her all the best,ehehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Makan begins with a drool, grows with a chomp, ends with a burp.When you were born, you were hungry and everyone around you was full.
