              <p>Sooner or later guys will have to learn to wear long pants to work. Besides, it looks more presentable than it is to wear shorts. Would you go for a debate in shorts? Would you go for a presentation in shorts? Its inappropriate and makes you look like a primary school kid. Would you like to go around being called didi?</p>
              <p>If you wanna talk about comfort and easiness of moving about, theres no difference between the two really. Its just your mind making you think and feel that way. </p>

              <p>you're telling me you reached puberty at the age of 16? Thats quite late dude. Most kids already start growing hair by P6...</p>
              <p>School kids you say? At the age of 15 you should already start learning to become an adult and learn to be more presentable.</p>
              <p>At that age your dick already got weed growing, you are representing your school when you wear your school uniform. That is something you should be looking presentable for at the least. You are supposed to give the impression of maturity and not the other way around..Teenagers want adult to treat them like adults but the impression some of them give is much rather the opposite. So do they really want to be treated as adults of schoolkids?</p>
              <p>Unless its your school I suggest you deal with it. Your main reason for asking is becoz of comfort and preference. If you don't feel like a more mature kid wearing long pants to school then its you against most of society. Sometimes we fail to see things becoz we choose wot we see. I don't really blame you.</p>

              <p><br>on the contrary,i feel that school shorts pair with the current school shirt better,n definitely match the PE t-shirt more nicely when in pe top school bottom attire.long pants will definitely restrict one way or another.when u bend down to get something,or have to run,friction between ur legs n the pants when u bend,or in the toilet.are u saying we look unpresentable from pri 1 to sec 2?i dont see girls worrying their shirt isnt made longer to be presentable.</p>
              <p>besides,despite how u claim u want to be viewed as more matured,u are still subjected to the same rules n requirements.if u get punished it looks more embarassing if u are in long pants than if ur still in shorts.at least thats how i feel....also i do not see any bearing between maturity n length of clothes.</p>

              <p>thats why you will never understand why. becoz its either you don't want to or you still have the mentality of a 12 year old.</p>
              <p>to you shorts seems better but to majority of people long pants is better. so if you look at that perspective, there must be something wrong with your way of thinking because in every single one of your post, you tell us you cannot understand. </p>
              <p>You already show us your problem when you said "<span style="line-height: 18px; font-size: 15px; color: #333333;">i find that very amusing,n cant understand why they'd feel like that."</span></p>

              <p>My post might look offensive from different perspectives.</p>
              <p>But like I said, if you cannot understand it in the majority's point of view, doesn't it mean you are mentally retarded? I'm using words as what they mean here and not as insults. And yes we are having a civil discussion. </p>
              <p>Throughout all of my posts I have been point out to you what majority of guys feel and you call that amusing. Its like you're in a world of your own. You can't seem to try and stick your head out of the box even.</p>
              <p>Would it be wrong if i use the word mentally retarded for anyone who can't seem to absorb what majority of people can understand?</p>
              <p>I can definitely understand a person's preference for shorts. Do you have fetish for legs? Coz it seems now you're point at a different direction about our desperation to hide our legs. We're not desperate to hide our legs. Its about the pants here and not our legs dude.</p>
              <p>I don't think at the pace you're going have you any right at all to talk about norms.</p>
