              <p>My post might look offensive from different perspectives.</p>
              <p>But like I said, if you cannot understand it in the majority's point of view, doesn't it mean you are mentally retarded? I'm using words as what they mean here and not as insults. And yes we are having a civil discussion. </p>
              <p>Throughout all of my posts I have been point out to you what majority of guys feel and you call that amusing. Its like you're in a world of your own. You can't seem to try and stick your head out of the box even.</p>
              <p>Would it be wrong if i use the word mentally retarded for anyone who can't seem to absorb what majority of people can understand?</p>
              <p>I can definitely understand a person's preference for shorts. Do you have fetish for legs? Coz it seems now you're point at a different direction about our desperation to hide our legs. We're not desperate to hide our legs. Its about the pants here and not our legs dude.</p>
              <p>I don't think at the pace you're going have you any right at all to talk about norms.</p>

              <p>my dear,calling someone mentally retarded,isnt that a severe insult?then what is?do u have people telling u that all the time or what?i wasnt even gona retaliate on the fact u think iv a mentality of a 12 yr old,but ur later word showed too much rudeness.n they ask why singaporeans are so rude....</p>
              <p>i dont have any fetish,its just that the way u jumped at me made me think otherwise.the majority isnt always right,if iv to pretend to believe what all else dictate then i think i'd be really dumb.even more so at present times.dont tell me what right i should have or not,i know my limits.iv to request u watch ur language instead.u sounded alright until the last post,tbh,n im rather disapointed u behave this way.</p>

              <p>If you said the language I used was rude, other would have already call you a fucking retard. I did no such thing. Its not like the word retarded is vulgar.</p>
              <p>The level of insult would depend on how the other party sees it. If you see it as something severe, then its your problem. Others in your shoes could look at it differently.</p>
              <p>LOL...Its not about dictation. But about agreement. If you think wearing shorts is presentable, wouldn't they make it an office wear?</p>
              <p>In the first place you kept on highlighting about presentation. Now if  99% of the whole world believes that wearing long pants is more presentable, why can't you understand that? Go to the foreign countries everywhere and you'd see the most of them are practicing the same thing.</p>
              <p>If you could be disappointed at the language I use, what makes you think I'm not disappointed at the fact that you keep on changing directions evading the problem i've been highlighting. Again I will say its just your preference to wear shorts but majority doesn't agree with you. Its not really a free world this world is. We'll just have to deal with it.</p>

              <p>What I cannot accept is that you can't even read and took my last post as a wall of vulgarities? If you can't read i really suggest you go back to school. </p>
              <p>The only vulgarity that came out of my post was used as an example of what others could have used on you. Theres a difference between hurling vulgarities and using it as an example and even explaining that it is an example.</p>

              <p><br>I agree shorts r better. Wat's the big deal about long pants anyway? One can wear them when one starts working..besides the weather here is so hot or rainy it's better to be comfortable when you're at school..also easier to change for PE. If upper sec boys are so concerned about leg hair and looking mature, they would be wearing long pants all the time. But most just can't wait to change back to shorts after school and nobody thinks they look silly do they? Is also a waste to get a new uniform pants if your shorts in sec2 can still fit.</p>

              <p>What you say is true but once they start wearing long pants and the novelty wears off they would rather be in shorts again. Some of my frens I remember they roll up their pants leg cos its so hot. They should at least make shorts an option for the upper sec...</p>

              <p>Fabrizzo, a few points.</p>
              <p>1) This is the internet. Don't like vulgarities? (although I dont see how deino used any vulgarities) Then get off the internet. Simple as that.</p>
              <p>2) Your posts seem well constructed in terms of word usage and vocabulary. However, your complete lack of punctuation and capitalization makes you sound completely 'mentally retarded'.</p>
              <p>If you are IN school at the moment, then perhaps you should concentrate less on how big of a dumbass you look like in Uniform and more about your grammer in English class. However, if you are a working adult then maybe you should not  waste so much time thinking about irrelevant matters like how big of a dumbass you looked back in secondary 3 and 4 and probably 5 and instead think about joining an English class at your nearby CC.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cheers! ^^</p>

              me to call u a ccb shitminded fucktard?why do u have to divert this
              discussion to a foul exchange of words?thats extremely revolting of
              u.i dun mind ur arguments but this has to stop.i didnt come in here
              with the intention of quarelling anyone,but u had to start it</p>

              <p>I have been following the post and Deino in no way had used vulgarities. He just simply showed you an example <strong>if </strong>he/ others had made use of vulgar words. </p>
              <p>Anyway, when you talk about school, you are talking about the future where you will be working in an office too. A school is a place where they nurture and guide you so that you can fit in better into your workplace in future. If right now, a small issue of wearing long or short pants gets into your way, how are you suppose to handle it when you work in an office?</p>
              <p>Are you going to come here and whine that why your bosses don't allow you wear short pants when it is much more comfortable? I agree that shorter pants are more comfortable, but when it comes to presentation, trust me, <strong>looks sells. </strong>So no one will bother whether is it comfortable or not, they just want you to market yourself as well as the organisation you are presenting well. </p>

              <p>I visited quite a few forum, and this forum is considered a lot more civil. </p>
              <p>You are right to have your own opinions and thoughts. But the thought is base on a reasoning that is not sufficient enough to uphold it. For comfort? Not when you are doing something which has got reputation and other factors at stake. When you want to hold to your belief, hold it on with good reasons. </p>
