It's just a never ending pressure cooker of sales and other jimjam.<br><br>Crowds are no excuse however, for discrimination. It's plain laziness and ill-upbringing amongst people to find that letting the disabled move around is causing inconvenience to them.<br><br>Wait till one of these idiots sit in a wheelchair, then they will learn a semblance of compassion and realise that shopping convenience is a privilege, and not an entitlement.<br><br>Gee..40 years of nationhood and we have not grown an iota.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No, it just wont work that way.<br><br>If trolleys are disallowed, it's still ok.<br><br>But if wheelchairs are disallowed......people think that is discrimination.<br><br>That is because when you use a trolley, it is merely a thing, an object, and you fill it with stuff, maybe groceries. It has no meaning.<br><br>But wheelchairs, a wheelchair is used by a disabled person, and society feel they should take care and love and sympathize with the less fortunate ones. It has a meaning.<br><br>Therefore someone can put up signs disallowing trolleys, but not wheelchairs. It just wont be acceptable.<br><br>Baby prams, I dont know, maybe also not acceptable to disallow.</div>
