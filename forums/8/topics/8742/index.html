            <div class='col-md body'>Talk about tyranny of the minority. It's amazing the things we have to endure in the name of racial harmony and tolerance. The Singapore Government's always getting lambasted about not giving equal opportunities to Malays, about not helping them enough, about not giving them a fair chance in school, in the industry, in the military etc etc. Just recently Lee Kuan Yew got whacked yet AGAIN concerning this. It will never be enough, I tell you. They will always strive to be the underdog, to be seen as oppressed, to be seen as the under-privilaged. Why? It is to their advantage after all. In a nation full of Chinese, that's the only way to gain some benefits. And they have done so very succesfully, I might add.<br><br>Especially in areas like education. The MOE's always having a hard time trying to find ways to so call boost the number of Malay graduates for all levels. And when they don't perform, it is the MOE's fault. Wonderful. Now here comes the National Football Academy to save the day...for the Malays. Finally, they have the chance to earn good money without studying just by kicking a ball around for what, $3000-$4000? I would love to kick a ball around for that amount as well. And how good exactly, is their standard of soccer? If their so good, why do we need to import so many foreign players? Is that all the S-League will be made up of? Malays and foreign players? The foreign players are better than the Malays! And how come there are so many Malays in the S-League? Oh no, not that Chinese and Indian players are all that good either, but you can't help wondering right? Well, it's the Malays ticket to an easy life. After all, if they can't study, they might as well kick a ball around and earn good money. It's just too bad that the obsession of having a local soccer league totally overshadowed this. Or perhaps not? Ok, let's not talk about soccer.<br><br>Talk about normal life. Malays are exceptionally persistent in honouring their religion. Nothing wrong with that. Every Friday they go to mosques to pray, which entitles them to the whole morning and afternoon. Nothing wrong either. In some schools, they even have a prayer room for them. How privilaged indeed! So much so that they abuse it. In a certian institution, the prayer room of the Malays was found to have graffiti on walls, with cigiratte butts and beer cans scattered on the floor. A complaint was made, and the warning notices were put up. To no avail. The same thing was repeated twice, and each time the Malays that used the room clamimed innocence. Finally, the room was simply closed off. No more prayer room. Up in arms, came the Malays to the principal, demanding that their prayer room be reopened. The reply was a firm negative. But the Malays insisted and insisted and got the help of religious teachers to back up their cause. The principal made a deal: Whoever drew the graffiti and smoked and drank, owe up. Sabotage was out of the question, since it was a Malay holding the key. The Malays refused. They claim that they were sabotaged. Who? No idea. And this is not an isolated incident. It may be one of the worst cases, but it is definately not exclusive to merely a few schools. To primary schools, secondary schools, JCs and poly ( I'm not too sure about NUS and NTU ), they are such cases of varying degrees of mischief. And the Malays always claim innocence.<br><br>If that is not bad enough, let's talk about something practical: food. Lots and lots of halal food out there, one might say. Is it a problem? Nope. Who cares anyway? Just make it all halal to accomodate them, never mind the rest. By the way, does anybody here know about the halal process? Let me explain then. This process is done by their own Muslim butchers, and they cut up the animal in a certain way which is supposed to make it halal. Very good. Do you guys know that they offer the animal that they have killed as a sarcrifice to their god, Allah? No, they don't do anything to the meat. They just face Mecca and offer their prayers. Now then, what is the big deal? If you don't care, it doesn't matter then. However, if I'm not wrong, the Lord Jesus did say in the Bible that his disciples must not eat food sacrificed to  idols. Christian, would you please tell me, is Allah an idol? If he isn't, fine and dandy. And by the way, the term "idol", what does it mean? An object of worship. By object, I suppose one might mean a PHYSICAL object. What a minute, there are no images of Allah! Yes, there aren't, but in Mecca, do you know that there is this thing called the Black Box? I'm not sure of its exact name, but inside that box is a stone. And every Muslim in the world when praying, would turn towards that stone and worship. Now, there is the idol! Don't believe me? Read up, ask your Muslim friends, do some research. What I am saying is current and true. So, Christians, have you been eating halal food? If so, you are guilty of eating food sacrificed to idols! Have you ever realised that? Ever? No? Go and find out if you don't believe me Christians. When you do find out that what I am saying is true, what are you going to do? Oh, that's your problem, not mine. Most likely you'll just keep quiet and not do anything, after all, the Muslims will surely be very offended. But having known this, how does feel it if let's say you do try not to eat halal food? What a nightmare! Goodness, halal food is everywhere! Oh nothing wrong for me. Just wondering what you Christians will do, that is, if you honour God not just in name of course. But what I have said is merely nitpicking to those who don't care.<br><br>How about this then? Their famous Ramadan, the month-long fast. They tell you that that they cannot eat or drink anything for one month. But, if you wish to observe, do you know that in the dead of the night they will gorge themselves silly? What hypocrisy. I know a few Malay friends who DO eat during Ramadan. Their job is to push railway cars containing electrical generators, which weigh around 2 or 3 tons, in order to connect them to trains. No time for fasting, thank you, we need to eat in order to get the job done.  Same goes for truckers, labourers, and other tasks which require lots of energy. Fair enough I suppose. Even Ramadan isn't worth losing their jobs. The problem is when other Malays do the same thing. In offices, especially, those obese Malay clerks munching away during teabreak. Who cares? Same goes for the office workers as well, though they are more discreet. Do I sound as though I'm whining? Perhaps I am. If they do not wish to honour their religion, that's their problem. The problem is when they make all sorts of excuses to justify slacking off. Every year it's the same. During Ramadan. What irks me most is that they really take advantage of everybody during that bloody month. Weakness, nausea, loss of concentration, you name it, they've go it. Which of course, justifies a series of long breaks and lunch hours. In schools, apparently any and all project work are automatically dumped onto the laps of their non-Chinese partners, or if there're all Malays, a postponement of the project deadline is an absolute MUST. Missing classes becomes the norm for that month, and somehow or other it is the month in which Malays get sick the most easily, with plenty of MCs and excuses as always. Oh, yes, I too would fall ill if I had to fast a month every year, but what makes me so mad is that I have witnessed so many eating whilst they are suppose to be fasting, and not a little bit, and they still act as thought they really haven't eaten at all! Like I said earlier, if they wish to bluff themselves, by all means it's their problem. But not at the expense of such lame excuses to get off work and study! My friends working or studying overseas also complain of the same, with some telling me that the school cook was totally fed-up with outrageous requests for meals in the middle of the night! Indeed, how much longer must we tolerate this?<br><br>I have not even begun to fully detail the benefits the Malays are given in Singapore in terms of education, housing, etc etc. The thing is, are they really as in need of help as they say they are? Do we really have to accede everytime they bring up their religion? Do we need to always give them a headstart in order to compensate for their, what, stupidity? Not only in Singapore mind you. In Malaysia, the so called bumiputras, ah, now there is an excellant example! They are so coddled by the Malaysian government in this regard, and then Mahathir complains that the bumiputras are not performing as well as non-bumiputras. What a joke. Since when did pampering companies ever helped to improve the economy? How much more do Malays need to be coddled? How much, and for how much longer?<br><br>Perhaps without these perks they wouldn't able to survive out there after all. If that is the case, the Malays are truly, and I say so justly, despicable. Despicable for pretending to be stupid and helpness; despicable because perhaps they truly are stupid and helpness, in which case we and the Singapore Government should kick our own asses for being so stupid by trying to help them so much and by accomodating them in so many, many ways. Next outburst please!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would have expected at least a convincing rebuttal of my various points. As it is apparently, I have expected too much. Of course, it is easy to stand far off and judge me a raving lunatic. But as I have said before, if you truly don't care about what's going on around you, then there is no point in replying here. Or if you do know but instead keep quiet in the name of racial tolerance, there is also no point in replying. Or perhaps you do not wish to find out for yourself, you do not wish to see things as they are, Rulakir. So you conveniently label me, among other things. Perhaps it is your ignorance that prevents you from rebutting me with facts. Why not go and find out more about what I have said before replying again? Not to search for faults among the other races, but to search for evidence about what I have said. Why not at least try? Or is it simply easier to sit down and say that I am a fanatic and a coward?<br><br>CopperWings, please, do not give what I personally term "primary school logic" answers. I am merely stating my unhappiness with the Malays. Have I said anything for or against the Chinese or the Europeans or the Americans? I believe not. Have I made any comparisons between Malays and other races? No. Then where then did this assumption of saying that Chinese are not that good either arise? Who is saying that the Chinese does not have many faults too? But how is that related? So just because the Chinese has many faults mean that they should tolerate the faults of the Malays? Most interesting. Does that mean that because of your own faults, you should keep quiet and tolerate the faults of others? Yes, I believe so. But up to what extent, may I ask? Pray, tell me, up to what extent? If people take advantage of you, do you keep quiet and say it's alright, it's ok, I have my own faults too? If that is the case, seeing that you have not made any protests, wouldn't the same people take even more and more advantage of you? And yet will you still keep quiet and say never mind, I have my own faults too? Does having one's own faults means letting others take advanatge of you, despite of their faults? To that, my answer is no.<br><br>So please gentlemen, take your time to write a full convincing rebuttal. And with facts and clarifications of course. Don't just sit there with your PC far off and give generalised "primary school logic" answers. Do a bit of footwork, eyework and brainwork and find out if what I have said in my post is true or not. If it's not, then say so and explain why. If it is, what will you do? Keep quiet again and tolerate all things because of your own faults? Take the log out my own eye, indeed. Or perhaps purposely remain blind through willful ignorance? I am sure that remaining willfully ignorant is as great a sin as judging others with a log in your eye. At least with my log, I try to see. You who perhaps claim to have a speck, do you see and say nothing, do nothing? Why not be totally blind in that case? Of course, if you don't care at all, then you shouldn't be replying in the first place. Good day.</div>

For everything that you have said here, I could say the opposite.

            <div class='col-md body'>Sigh......<br>I wanted to leave this alone, but since you have called me out to refute your claims, fine.<br><br>You want rebuttals, I'll give you rebuttals. But for someone who names himself Allah, <strong>AND</strong> has only 2 posts, you shouldn't be blaming me and the others for treating you, in your own words "as a raving lunatic".<br><br>As a foreword, I'm going to make several material comparisons between his complains, to that of what some of the other religions have as a rebuttal. So, do read with an open mind, and correct me if I'm wrong in certain things.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Lets start with the dissection of your overall complaints shall we ?<br><br><blockquote>Every Friday they go to mosques to pray, which entitles them to the whole morning and afternoon. Nothing wrong either. In some schools, they even have a prayer room for them. </blockquote>Lets start with the friday prayer. It is interesting that you say that they go the the mosques for the entire morning to the whole afternoon, when in actuality, they go for their prayers from about 11 am to 2 pm. That's pretty close to lunch time, IMO.<br><br>Of course, that's the same as saying that Sunday is for another major religion to go to church for chapel services and masses yes ? Is it anyone's fault that their prayer day doesn't fall on a weekday ?<br><br>In certain schools, they have prayer rooms for them ? Fine. AFAIK, all tertiary institutes, with perhaps the exception of the ITEs have a prayer room for the buddahists(sp?), and the Christians too. So what's the point ? Everyone has a prayer room Equality achieved. Some schools don't really have the extra rooms in the first place, but you can almost always assume that there's one for the christians too.<br><br>I'll skip that vandalism part, since its all speculation. The evidence might seem obvious, but since we're not policemen, and we don't know how to go about such things, we'll not go into it. Plus, if they do not respect their own prayer room, and take precautions to prevent history from repeating itself, then its their own fault. The school will have its own way of handling things.<br><br>Halal food processing technique. You've covered the base foundations of how its done, but you have not written the intentions. In Muslim religion, their chants is similar to that of the Buddists(sp?) to let the spirit of the animal killed move on. To them, its supposed to be a sort of purification process. Sacrifice to their god Allah ?  Don't know about that, but highly unlikely. (It is interesting to note from a philosophical point of view that almost all religions have some sort of sacrifice involved in their rituals at one point of time or the other.)<br><br>Okay, here's the part that I'm miffed about. When people complain about another religion, must they hide behind another religion ??? Don't they have ANY other forms of cover other than religion ??? And please try not to incite the Christians on this board to dislike or even hate their fellow man.<br><br>As for the Mecca stone, that's like saying that people who kneel in front of a statue of say, Buddha or Jesus and uses it as a focal point of their prayers is equivalent to praying to an idol....<br><br>Noting that you dislike Halal food so much, I suggest that you start a farm, raise your own vegetables, and animals, and cook food the Non-Halal way. That way, you wouldn't be contaminated by anything that you don't believe in.<br><br>The Ramadan Fast. You do realise that the fast, while traditionally expected to be followed, has been modified to suit the modern age ? Besides, if you've been eating a meal a day for an entire week, I wouldn't be surprised that you would gorge yourself once the opportunity presents itself.<br><br>Here's a similar question. If you broke a leg, would you still go all out to work your butt off ? or take as many opportunities as you can to slack in your job ? Such behaviour is human, and it is in the human nature to abuse something until it goes beyond its limit.<br><br>Humans by nature are lazy, and if you can get something for free without having to work for it, why not ?<br><br>I am not ignorant, dear sir. Rather, I prefer to leave things as volatile as religion, race, and traditions as they are. If you are not happy with the situation, then, perhaps you ought to do something about it. Be it migrating, perhaps to China, joining the Nazis, or making a nice deep cut with a knife across your throat, that's entirely up to you.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rulakir (edited 22 August 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen for your views, whether relevant or irrelevant, logical or illogical. It seems to me that only Rulakir and Maya ( or Saya? ) have the capacity to refute me, and for that I am grateful. Don't worry, I am not backing down just yet. I always enjoy a jolly good round two, though severe time constraints do hinder my ability to do so for the present.<br><br>And my dear Rulakir, what is it with my nick and the number of posts? I consider it an irony, or a sick joke perhaps, that someone called Allah would rail against the Malays and Muslims. How does the thought strike you, if indeed there is an Allah? For all you know, the real Allah might completely agree with me! As for the number of posts...what is the significance may I ask? Pray, do tell.<br><br>So far, it would seem that every person who has replied is a Chinese, or at most not a Malay and a Muslim. Yes, thank you for the views from the Chinese, but how about the Malays themselves? I would dearly love to read their replies, get it straight from the horse's mouth so to speak. So, any Malays with enough brains and guts to refute me? Or is the computer and the Internet still a little too advanced for them to use? Or perhaps I have come to the wrong place? Perhaps I have. Any Malay forums where I can take my diatribe to? Pray, do recommend.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>that was a really charming little post. "allah" extremely eloquently voiced practically all the negative "characteristics" of the malay community that has ever been raised. one wonders how much better he'll do if he devotes this same effort to more socially-friendly causes that would benefit all of us.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>i shall not be so bold as to attempt a pt by pt rebuttal, since i'm half asleep and probably missed half of what "Allah" was trying to say. however, i'll like to add my 2-cents worth (what to do? people like to talk.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">).<br><br>"ALLAH":<br>firstly, i feel that you've probably been making sweeping generalisations.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> you might have found all these pts true from your own personal experiences and stories you've heard, but do bear in mind that there're always exceptions to the rule. furthermore, it is often the more shocking, headlines-grabbing incidents that grab our attn and stick in our heads. we often forget the little acts of kindness/courtesy granted to us daily, but the tiniest negative incident would get passed around like wildfire. it would do you good if you could summarise your pts, and phrase them more coherently, so we can understand your true intentions instead of squibbling on little details.<br><br>i definitely dont agree with this post, finding it a tad too extremist for my taste. i admit that i have been unhappy in the past regarding how muslims sometimes defend their "rights" too vehemently, usually at the expense of the rest of the pop, but my animousity(??no spellchk. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> sorry) doesnt extend so far. you shld note that usually, it's a small grp of malay/muslim extremists who stir up the "trouble", claiming to speak on the behalf of the rest of their community. sometimes, their claims remain rather doubtful.<br><br>lastly, i'll like to urge you to be a little more sensitive. it isnt fair to condemn an entire race/religion without concrete evidence. furthermore, using their god's name for a nick is, IMHO, going WAY too far. you dont have to be so drastic to display your unhappiness you know....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>but somehow i feel this post was more to stir up the forums and get a reaction, rather than expecting a serious discussion. good luck in finding someone to listen, and argue with ya.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Fuck I had enough of this discriminating Malay shit. First of all I must say to the guys that keeps condemning the Malay race I all I have to say that you are all nothing but piece of gutless shit. Only know how to talk big online where no one knows who you are and that you can hide behind that monitor of yours. If you guys really hate us that much, say it straight to our face when u see a Malay walkin down the street. Dont just vent ur anger by using this forum. Cause an uprising, hell make a racial riot for all I care!<br>Anyway heres to clear most of the things about Malay and Islam and also raising a few points of my own,<br><br>1) About the equal opportunities in SG. Yes we Malays are not give equal opportunities. Look at the state of the SAF for God's sake. We Malays r not even allowed to be a commanding officer of an army fearing that when if there will be a war against Malaysia or Indonesia, the malays will side with them. Please! If China were to invade use, will u Chinese side with China?? I dont think so rite?? This is OUR homeland, we were born and raised here! We have national pride too! The handful of Malay officers ard is just to show the neighbourin countries that SG HAVE Malay officers and ONE Malay pilot but we all know that is just a facade. To save the trouble of being labelled of not having equal opportunities. Look at the Commandoes, theres no Malay commando as far as I know. Navy? No need to say.<br>So the new Football Academy has been set up to accomodate the Malays of a career?? Hahaha! What utter rubbish. Lets face it SG is a paper chasing country, which parents will ever allow their children to pursue a career in sports?? Because we Malays actually are passionate enough and care abt the game and hey if u r good enough why not make it as job, rather than doing something that you hate rite?<br>Allah r u gd enough to play? If u r go ahead and call up FAS. They desperately need a real gd striker now. $3-4K per mth is big and easy money? A footballer's career, well any sporting career is short. 7-8 yrs if u start out young, 5-6 if u start late. So what r they gonna do after that?? Thats y they need to know that they will be earnin lots now just in case something happens later. Same goes with ANY pro football league. Worst what if they got a serious injury that might stop them from playin again?? Anyway look at England for instance youngsters are paid 1-2K pounds a week! Lets not even go to the salaries of the top pro.<br>And about S-League made up of Malays and foreigners, hahaha that would be something isnt it? But have u ask urself whats the reason why there isnt many Chinese playing soccer?? If you can answer that question then you know that this notion Malay dominating S-League is a whole pile of rubbish. How about the foreigners? What abt them you ask? Have you seen an English Premier League or Serie A match recently?? Look at Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Milan, Inter, Juventus and even Man Utd! They r not made up of 11 English or Italian men. So I dont see the logic here.<br>Ok education. What about them? If u you want to say unfair look at the names of the schools. CHINESE High, Singapore CHINESE Girl School or watever Chinese naming school. Do you see a Malay High or SG Indian High School?? Or maybe Semangat Sec or Kejayaan Sec?? Again u all must say that there r handful of Malay naming schools, but please once again that is just a facade!<br><br>2)Ok now we're complaining abt the things Muslims do in general. First of all abt the weekly Friday prayers. As Rulakir has said, that the prayers only last frm 12-2. Does that 2 hrs really mean anything?? Will the world stop functioning and the stock markets crashing during these two hours?? Please!! If u cut off 1 hr of our lunch time, we only make use of another hr! And please remember we dont have the luxury and time to eat our lunch! Christians r lucky to have Sat, Sunday and Fri evening masses where ppl dont usually work. So please, use abit of common sense here.<br>Prayer rooms, well I dont know which pri or sec schools have them but as for higher institutions as far as I know ALL major religions have their room. Hell some schools have their OWN churches. Vandalising and stuff that I dont know. Maybe Allah u r the one that vandalised the place for all we know.<br>Ok Halal food. What makes a food halal? As Rulakir has said cleared most the doubts so if Allah is so worked up abt eating Halal food then stay away from them! Eat all ur char siew, pig's brain or watever shit you eat. And stay away from the Mee Rebus, Mee Siam, Lontong, Rendang, etc...<br>Fasting month. I must say I personally dont enjoy that particular period. But hell have any of Chinese ever tried it before?? Going on through the day without food and drink from dawn to dusk?? If you have and managed to stay bubbly, energetic and cheerful then I say gd for u and we are all wrong! If u havent then SHUT UP! You all dont even know what Ramadhan signifies. Its not only abt not drinkin and eating. Its more than that! Its a test of mind AND body. Theres alot of thing we Muslims cant do during fasting mth but I wont go into details on what they r. And isit wrong that we eat alot when break fast??? Hell you guys after a hard day's work look forward to ur dinner! Imagine a hard day's work without food and drink!<br>Well I must say that I am quiet ashamed that a few of the Muslims in SG dont really follow the teachings of Islam(y do they call themselves Muslim in the first place anyway?). However EVERY religion has its own rebels. Look at Jesus Christ! He was a Jew!! So get my drift here??<br>So you want to know what irks me?? Hungry Ghost Festivals or 7th Mth or watever u call it. Burnin of joss papers and God knows what other stuffs. Fills the air with smoke which really irritates me! The whole area gets smoky and smells! The mornin after those inconsiderates one who burn without using the bin will cause the place to be dirty with all the ashes. What have u say about that Allah??<br><br>Ok I think I'll stop here for now. Dont worry pt 2 will soon follow...</div>

From the post by "Allah" I will have to conclude that you are still studying. From many years ago, as far as I can remember, Malay students have been given special concessions as far as school fees and school books are concerned. I cannot confirm this as it has been quite some time, statistics showed that Malay students were not doing as well and so this was a form of help given to them to help them along. It has helped, I have many Malay colleague, more experienced, more educated and more senior. My boss is a Malay and I respect him for focus.<br><br>In SpookyKids post of why are there schools such as Singapore Chinese Girls, Chinese High, Anglo Chinese etc, these were founded by Chinese associations, apart from the government. I am sure if a Malay association decide to found one of their own, they can name it what ever they want, "Reformasi Secondary", "School of the oppressed" what ever.<br><br>On the issue of the fast, special concessions are made for our fasting colleagues.
