            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry...you can't sompare the two show...both are veering very distinctively in their own directions...<br><br>Star Wars is fantasy Sci-fi...You know that most of the things in that movie cannot possibly be done...Where got yoda and where got the "force" which this new movie has reduced from a fantastically mystical thing into "mitochondrians?"...wah...so scientific...and so...lame man...They effectively just destroyed the whole appeal and mystery of the force by turning it into a plant derivative sound-alike name...and the shit movie was aime so much for boys younger than 10...i remember the first trilogies...after the end of the show, everyone in the theater would stand up and clapp like hell....compare it to this new Phantom Menace...Not even one person clapped when the show ended...sheesh...obviously, it looked like one big commercial to sell Lucas toys...so dissappointed in George...RElying too much on Technology to make his movie sell instead of sticking to the actual movie itself....Matrix Kicked ass!!!!  What menace was teh movie talking about by the way?...I didb't feel any kind of mencae at all..<br><br>If you're talking about Darth Maul, he may have looked menacing, but he definately didn't exude menace...he appeared for less than a mintue...and even still he got chopped to smithereens at the end of that one minute. Also didn't even play well to the emotional aspect of the viewers...After QuiGonn died and was being creamated Jedi style...they go and make the scene damn cold and emotionless one...Where got...i didn't even feel he died one...<br><br>Now I'm a fan of Star Wars...But not a fanatic ok...I love my movies and there are standards to keep when judging movies...and to me...Phantom menace flopped as a show...(but made money...Goes to show you that sometimes being shallow can get you laces)...I didn't expect anything from the movie...in fact  I didn't know much about the Phantom menace before ZI went to watch it...but it was still quite dissappointing...I went home and watch a TCS show with more heart than Phantom...aiyoh!....not good man...<br><br>Star Trekkkkkk is sci-fi....You can actually see that we can achieve everything Trek shows can...For those who dun know...We already have a matter transporter...Science has developed already...at present can transport 1 partical (of what I forget) from one point of space to another without that piece of matter moving through the space....Quite cool...So in effect, Star Trek is a lot more believable...<br><br>I still preferred the original series tho and the last few movies really sucked...they always get into this family bonding thing ion the movies...The original Star Trek movie and Wrath of Kahn and the Search for Spock was damn good....Especially #1 and Wrath of Khan...VEry Sci-Fi.....Search for Spock was when it started to get more into the family movie type thing...I guess they just got too popular...Teh rest after those three, even tho they were enjoyable to watch, were pretty lame compared to the original 3 movies...<br><br>I love the Jame T. Kirk Series best because it was about exploration, danger, uncertainty, and wonder....the Next Generation is more bland...always about diplomacy...Every show is like one big family get-together...And everyone is so proper it's not funny....<br><br>That's Why I like Star trek Voyager because it reminds me of what the old shows were about...new crew, new ship(ok so the name isn't as snazzy as Enterprise), new stories, but the whole essense of the originals was so evident in this series (soemthing very lacking in Generation)....And that james t. Kirk...What style he had!!!  So ....cool but in a funny kind of way...but definitely cool...and even tho the props and action was quite fake, it gave me more of a rush and stayed in my mind longer than the generation series...dun get me wrong, generatioins is a good show, but too "clean" and filtered for my taste...more like a commercialised sci-fi show...Now james T. kirk....his shows were calssics...:-)<br><br>And notice that Voyager doesn't share much popularity...just the same way that The Kirk series went thru...you know why?...Becasue it;'s real sci-fi and not the commercialised one....not that anything's wrong with that, but I prefer more "underground" sci-fi....like the original Star wars Trilogy.....<br><br>oh yeah, The Space battle scenes and landing scenes are more believable and more stunning than the generatioj shows...generations is just way too mcleaned up man...veryone looks like they just came out of the dry cleaners...even after they supposedly got their ship blasted in half...<br><br>ah...but Kirk serise and movies had coool space scenes and battles nad stuff...<br><br>Anyone want to compare notes?...:-)<br><br>Scott me up Beam me!!! or is that Beam me up Scottie?...ha ha:-)<br><br>[This message has been edited by firewire (edited 09-12-1999).]</div>
