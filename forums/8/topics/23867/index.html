            <div class='col-md body'>One of the qualities that we often seek of a partner (and even of close friends) is that of understanding.<br><br>You tend to talk about deep, heart-to-heart matters with people that you think understand you. They don't have to agree, but at least they get what you mean. Right?<br><br>Right.<br><br>So how do you know someone understands you? REALLY understanding what you are saying, not just the language you are using? We all know communication is important in any relationship. But communicating to a person that doesn't really understand you defeats the purpose.<br><br>This is how I define understanding:<br><br><strong>Understanding is a two way road. </strong><br><br>Obviously the people talking to each other have to have a common ground for communication. Language is often used, and it's English for me. Other forms include body language, eye contact etc.<br><br>So I will explain to the best of my ability what I am thinking or feeling. This is the easy part.<br><br>The two way road is only completed when the person I am talking to communicates back to me that he or she does truly understand. Easy you think? Not so, my friend.<br><br>It's much more than saying <span style="font-style: italic;">"I understand"</span>. I don't know what it is, but there is this feeling of <span style="font-style: italic;">relief</span> after I finish my verbal diarrhoea and somehow the person I was talking to manages to communicate back to me that they actually did understand what I was babbling about.<br><br>It could be thru body language, it could be their replies, it could be their eye-contact, it could be by saying "I understand" and  <span style="font-style: italic;">it could be by doing nothing at all</span>.<br><br>This is why I feel, that you may have a problem that you really need to talk about, and you choose to only talk it through with certain people. It's because somehow you KNOW they will understand. It has been communicated to you before that the person does understand what you are talking about. It's almost like saying "at least I talk to him/her I know I won't be wasting my breath".<br><br>Then there are people that you talk to but they seem uninterested. Sure they understand what you are talking about, I mean you are using a language that both of you are fluent in. But somehow they don't seem to be able to communicate to you in no certain terms that they actually really deep down <strong>do</strong> understand you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm... jOhO.... after reading your thoughts... you've somewhat brought me back to school days when i had to learn about a similar topic... except that the subject was called <span style="color: red;"><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Listening</span></strong></span> . Somehow, i feel that these 2 topics are correlated.. so...allow me to give a mini tutorial here...<br><br>Listening is actually a skill. Not everyone is capable of <strong>good</strong> listening. Before you say, <span style="font-style: italic;">"Easy lar.. just hear that person tok only wat.."</span> please hold your horses... If someone tells you <span style="font-style: italic;">"I'm ok"</span> but does it with a frown... do you really think what you hear is what the person truly meant?<br><br>Using this simple example.. someone who's good at listening might probe a little more.. by saying back <span style="font-style: italic;">"are you sure you are ok? you don't sound ok.. wanna tok about it?"</span> or perhaps something along the lines of <span style="font-style: italic;">"I'm sure ya ok but if you ever feel like sharing any problems.. i'm here for ya"</span> Basically.. you'll be sensitive towards that person cos you can <strong>listen</strong> that deep down he or she is feeling somewhat down. Conversely, a person who is completely unable to listen at all.. will probably reply back something like <span style="font-style: italic;">"Great!! Now let's go do something fun like bungee jumping!!"</span> I think if that person was in serious depression enough... you'll probably be tempting him or her to bungee jump without a rope.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: darkblue;">Listening involves not just hearing of words... but also fine tuning to that person's emotions... feelings and moods. </span></span><br><br>Why do we usually expect close friends and loved ones to show us better understanding? That's becos we ourselves would tend to expect own close friends and loved ones to be better at listening to ourselves...  In a way, tat's quite true. People do tend to listen more or listen better to different people. We would show greater patience in listening to people who are close to us... and fine tuning becomes easier when you know the person's minute habits which could be tell tale signs of their deep down emotions.<br><br>Notwithstanding... good listening is a tough skill and no one can be absolutely perfect at it. Just becos we would tend to show greater patience and better fine tuning to close ones does not mean that we are good at it. I dont suppose i should indulge too much on how to improve listening skills as that's a completely different topic altogether.. and besides... there's way too much to say there...<br><br>In conclusion, i guess the point i am trying to make here is.. the art of understanding someone starts with listening.. Might be worthwhile if we all try to start brushing up on tat skill... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Which also brings into mind another word <span style="font-style: italic;">Sensitive</span>.<br><br>we often think that ppl need to listen to us, need to understand us, and need to be sensitive towards us, yet, we dun really do the same....<br><br>if this is taken into consideration of an r/s, these 3 factors are very very important...<br><br>no, i'm not saying u muz be "over-sensitive" but being sensitive enuf to UNDERSTAND and LISTEN.<br><br>u can listen, u can "try to understand" yet..... if u are not being sensitive to the person's feelings, u may end up hurting him/her unknowingly.....<br><br>how impt. are these 3 factors? go figure...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
