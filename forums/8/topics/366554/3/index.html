              <p>Dear Xunni,</p>
              <p>It is most shocking and horrific to have read your first post in this thread.</p>
              <p>Since the dawn of civilisation, mankind had sought to learn to live side by side in harmony and peace, but at times, conflicts do arise, which resulted in barbaric wars, where might is considered right, and it was perfectly acceptable that the weak be exterminated and have no right to rule, and should be ruled instead.</p>
              <p>But at no time was there ever a WORLD war, where societies pit themselves against each other on a global scale, till the 1st world war in 1914. After the war, whomever was right or wrong, humanity had seen the horrors it had wrought on each other, and were determined to stop such inhuman activities again.</p>
              <p>There must be a cut-off point somewhere, or we will never cease in the blame game, and can even trace animosities or barbarism way back to millions years ago as cavemen.</p>
              <p>The cut-off point began after world war 1, where every human were taught to respect and value human lives instead of perpetrating senseless aggressive wars, which may ultimately doom mankind, if the 'an eye for an eye' policy was adopted instead of better diplomacy and compromise.</p>
              <p> Smaller nations were given freedom, and were aligned for protection by stronger states such as Poland protected by England and France, the victors against german aggression.</p>
              <p>Japan, thanks to US intervention in the 18th century, opened up and modernised the feudal society, culturally exchanging technologies and education. The intelligent and hardworking japanese soon caught up with their European counterparts, and were determined to reap their share of colonisation and raping of other nation's resources, which they lacked.</p>
              <p>Germany, under Hitler, was determined to maintain racial superiority as well as to enlarge its land holdings onto the European continent.</p>
              <p>These 2 rapacious and low self esteem nations then challenged the world. They could be be forgiven if they had done so in a less barbaric manner, but the:-</p>
              <p>a) practise of duplicity while conducting negotiations</p>
              <p>b.) mass murder of civilian human beings to the tune of millions.</p>
              <p>are certainly unforgivable, by any other human being and its victims. No other nation since world war 1 had conducted or even condone such barbaric acts against non-combatants, more so after nations decided to respect the value of innocent human lives.</p>
              <p>That you chosed to villify others while justifying the WW2 Axis actions only makes me weep. Weep because it seemed our social spending on education had failed you, in allowing such horrific perceptions to exist in you, a modern educated person.</p>
              <p>I can only hope you are an exception rather than the norm, or our future as well as the future of humanity will be doomed by more of your kind. I need not even go further on your attempted curtailing of others' freedom of expression.</p>
              <p>Goes to show how much you respect such freedom, and only want it for yourself but not for others, displaying the signs and symptoms of growing tyranny and dictatorial authoritarian character traits in you, the very traits in which you profess to hate in your disdain of the ruling party.</p>
              <p>Look at yourself in the mirror. I know you would not like what i had wrote, but someone will have to wake you up to reality. Better me, only an insignificant fella here who doesnt give a damn to insults, than to see others hurt. </p>

              <p>You must understand that Britain and France were forced against their will to declare war on Germany.</p>
              <p>What they wanted was to arrange another munich where Germany would annex parts of polish territory and then according to these strategists, Germany would go on and attack the Soviet Union.</p>
              <p>But unfortuntely, Germany invaded Poland, so they had to declare war otherwise they would had lost face because Britain had already guaranteed Poland they would assist if Poland attacked.</p>
              <p>That guarantee by Britain was also bullshit, designed to warn Hitler not to attack, because if Germany attacked Poland, the public in Britain would not accept it and Britain had to make some sort of move against Germany and that would ruin Chamberlain's grand strategy of forming an alliance with Germany against the USSR.</p>
              <p>The game gets more complicated once Britain and France declared war, because they were still carrying out their plan of instigating a German-Soviet war.</p>
              <p>So they couldn't actually go and seriously fight Germany.</p>
              <p>You can read the details of this commplex game here:</p>
              <p>It is usually said that the events of March 1939 revealed Hitler's
                  real nature and real ambitions, and marked the end of appeasement. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This
                  is certainly not true as stated.</strong></span></span> It may have opened the eves of the
                  average man to the fact that appeasement was merely a kind of slow
                  suicide, and quite incapable of satisfying the appetites of aggressors
                  who were insatiable. It also made clear that Hitler was not really
                  concerned with self-determination or with a desire to bring all Germans
                  "back to the Reich." The annexation of territories containing millions
                  of Slavs showed that Hitler's real aim was power and wealth and
                  eventually world domination. Thus, from March onward, it became almost
                  impossible to sell appeasement to the public, especially to the British
                  public, who were sufficiently sturdy and sensible to know when they had
                  had enough.</p>
              <p>But the British public and the British government were two
                  different things, and it is quite untrue to say that the latter learned
                  Hitler's real ambitions in March 1939 and determined to oppose them.
                  <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Above all, it is completely wrong to say this of Chamberlain, who, more
                  and more, was running foreign policy as his own personal business. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Nevertheless, concessions to Germany continued. But
                  now parallel with concessions went a real effort to build up a strong
                  front against Hitler for the day when concessions would break down.
                  Moreover, concessions were different after March 17th because now they
                  had to be secret. They had to be secret because public opinion refused
                  any longer to accept any actions resembling appeasement, but they were
                  continued for several reasons. In the first place British rearmament
                  was slow, and concessions were given to win time. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In the second place
                  the projects of the anti-Bolsheviks and "three-bloc-world" supporters
                  demanded continued concessions. In the third place, Chamberlain
                  continued to work to achieve his seven-point settlement with Hitler in
                  the hope that he could suddenly present it to the British electorate as
                  a prelude to a triumphant General Election which he planned for the
                  winter of 19391940. </strong></span></span>Of these three causes, the first, to gain time for
                  rearmament, w-as the least important, although it was the one most
                  readily used to justify secret concessions when they were found out.
                  This is clear from the nature of the concessions. These were frequently
                  such as to strengthen Germany rather than to gain time for Britain.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The projects of the anti-Bolsheviks and the "three-bloc-world"
                  supporters were too dangerous to admit publicly, but they were
                  sufficiently well known in Berlin </strong></span></span>to lead to the belief, even in
                  moderate circles, that Britain would never go to war for Poland. For
                  example, Weizsà¹„cker, the German secretary of state, chided Nevile
                  Henderson in June 1939 for abandoning his often-repeated statement that
                  "England desired to retain the sea; the European Continent could be
                  left to Germany." However, these two groups, although still active in
                  1939, and even in 1940, had not originally envisaged the complete
                  destruction of Czechoslovakia or Poland. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>They had expected that Hitler
                  would get the Sudentenland, Danzig, and perhaps the Polish Corridor and
                  that he would then be stabilized between the "oceanic bloc" and the
                  Soviet Union, with contact with the latter across the Baltic States.</strong></span></span> It
                  was expected that a rump Czechoslovakia and a rump Poland would be able
                  to survive between Germany and Russia, as Holland or Switzerland could
                  survive between the oceanic bloc and Germany. Moreover, the
                  "three-bloc-world" supporters never wanted Hitler to drive southward
                  either to the Adriatic or to the Aegean. Accordingly, although divided
                  in respect to Romania and the Black Sea, they were determined to
                  support Turkey and Greece against both Germany and Italy...</p>

              <p>And don't expect any TV documentary, movie or history book to tell you all these, because this interpretation of events is suppressed in the english world.</p>
              <p>But if you go to other worlds, they will tell you.</p>
              <p>For example the left wing world:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hitler denounced the treaties imposed on Germany following WW1 and
                  commenced the rearmament of Germany. He intended to take his revenge
                  for Germany’s defeat in WW1 and for the seizure of German colonies by
                  Britain and France.<br><br> Far from opposing Nazism, however, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the political leaders of Britain and
                  France and a number of other western countries believed that they could
                  use Hitler to destroy what they saw as a far greater danger to their
                  power and privileges — the Bolsheviks of the Soviet Union...</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Barthou brought the USSR into the League of Nations and, as Germany and
                  Japan left it, the Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov began the fight for
                  the adoption of the principle of collective security.<br><br> However, influential leaders of the capitalist powers believed that
                  German fascism was the only bulwark against Bolshevism. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>They
                  confidently expected that a re-armed Germany would sweep to the East
                  and destroy the centre of the Red contagion — the USSR...</strong></span></span></p>
