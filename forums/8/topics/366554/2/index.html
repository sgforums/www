              <p>Everyone says that Japan, Germany and Italy were at fault and
                                              they were the ones who caused world war 2 and demanded that they
                                              apologise.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Britain was also at fault because it was they who encouraged Hitler to expand eastwards and then go attack Russia.</p>
              <p>France tried to encircle Germany but Britain blocked her efforts to do so as Britain's agenda was to let Germany go east.</p>
              <p>But don't expect english textbooks or historians to tell you this.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>...Any analysis of the motivations of Britain in 1938-1939 is bound to be difficult because different people had different motives, motives changed in the course of time, the motives of the government were clearly not the same as the motives of the people, and in no country has secrecy and anonymity been carried so far or been so well preserved as in Britain. In general, motives become vaguer and less secret as we move our attention from the innermost circles of the government outward. As if we were looking at the layers of an onion, we may discern four points of view: (1) the anti-Bolsheviks at the center, (2) the "three-bloc-world" supporters close to the center, (3) the supporters of "appeasement," and (4) the "peace at any price" group in a peripheral position. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The "anti-Bolsheviks," who were also anti-French, were extremely important from 1919 to 1926, but then decreased to little more than a lunatic fringe, rising again in numbers and influence after 1934 to dominate the real policy of the government in 1939. In the earlier period the chief figures in this group were Lord Curzon, Lord D'Abernon, and General Smuts. They did what they could to destroy reparations, permit German rearmament, and tear down what they called "French militarism."</strong></span></span><br><br>     This point of view was supported by the second group, which was known in those days as the Round Table Group, and came later to be called, somewhat inaccurately, the Cliveden Set, after the country estate of Lord and Lady Astor. It included Lord Milner, Leopold Amery, and Edward Grigg (Lord Altrincham), as well as Lord Lothian, Smuts, Lord Astor, Lord Brand (brother-in-law of Lady Astor and managing director of Lazard Brothers, the international bankers), Lionel Curtis, Geoffrey Dawson (editor of The Times), and their associates. This group wielded great influence because it controlled the Rhodes Trust, the Beit Trust, The Times of London, The Observer, the influential and highly anonymous quarterly review known as The Round Table (founded in 1910 with money supplied by Sir Abe Bailey and the Rhodes Trust, and with Lothian as editor), and it dominated the Royal Institute of International Affairs, called "Chatham House" (of which Sir Abe Bailey and the Astors were the chief financial supporters, while Lionel Curtis was the actual founder), the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust, and All Souls College, Oxford. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This Round Table Group formed the core of the three-bloc-world supporters, and differed from the anti-Bolsheviks like D'Abernon in that they sought to contain the Soviet Union between a German-dominated Europe and an English-speaking bloc rather than to destroy it as the anti-Bolsheviks wanted. Relationships between the two groups were very close and friendly, and some people, like Smuts, were in both.</strong></span></span><br><br>    <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> The anti-Bolsheviks, including D'Abernon, Smuts, Sir John Simon, and H. A. L. Fisher (Warden of All Souls College), were willing to go to any extreme to tear down France and build up Germany. </strong></span></span>Their point of view can be found in many places, and most emphatically in a letter of August 11, 1920, from D'Abernon to Sir Maurice (later Lord) Hankey, a protà¹‰gà¹‰ of Lord Esher who wielded great influence in the inter-war period as secretary to the Cabinet and secretary to almost every international conference on reparations from Genoa (1922) to Lausanne (1932). D'Abernon advocated a secret alliance of Britain "with the German military leaders in cooperating against the Soviet." As ambassador of Great Britain in Berlin in 1920-1926, D'Abernon carried on this policy and blocked all efforts by the Disarmament Commission to disarm, or even inspect, Germany (according to Brigadier J. H. Morgan of the commission).<br><br>     The point of view of this group was presented by General Smuts in a speech of October 23, 1923 (made after luncheon with H. A. L. Fisher). From these two groups came the Dawes Plan and the Locarno pacts. It was Smuts, according to Stresemann, who first suggested the Locarno policy, and it was D'Abernon who became its chief supporter. H. A. L. Fisher and John Simon in the House of Commons, and Lothian, Dawson, and their friends on The Round Table and on The Times prepared the ground among the British governing class for both the Dawes Plan and Locarno as early as 1923 (The Round Table for March 1923; the speeches of Fisher and Simon in the House of Commons on February 19, 1923, Fisher's speech of March 6th and Simon's speech of March 13th in the same place, The Round Table for June 1923; and Smuts's speech of October 23rd).<br><br>     The more moderate Round Table group, including Lionel Curtis, Leopold Amery (who was the shadow of Lord Milner), Lord Lothian, Lord Brand, and Lord Astor, sought to weaken the League of Nations and destroy all possibility of collective security in order to strengthen Germany in respect to both France and the Soviet Union, and above all to free Britain from Europe in order to build up an "Atlantic bloc" of Great Britain, the British Dominions, and the United States. They prepared the way for this "Union" through the Rhodes Scholarship organization (of which Lord Milner was the head in 1905-1925 and Lord Lothian was secretary in 1925-1940), through the Round Table groups (which had been set up in the United States, India, and the British Dominions in T 910- 1917), through the Chatham House organization, which set up Royal Institutes of International Affairs in all the dominions and a Council on Foreign Relations in New York, as well as through "Unofficial Commonwealth Relations Conferences" held irregularly, and the Institutes of Pacific Relations set up in various countries as autonomous branches of the Royal Institutes of International Affairs. This influential group sought to change the League of Nations from an instrument of collective security to an international conference center for "nonpolitical" matters like drug control or international postal services, to rebuild Germany as a buffer against the Soviet Union and a counterpoise to France, and to build up an Atlantic bloc of Britain, the Dominions, the United States, and, if possible, the Scandinavian countries.<br><br>     One of the effusions of this group was the project called Union Now, and later Union Now with Great Britain, propagated in the United States in 1938-1945 by Clarence Streit on behalf of Lord Lothian and the Rhodes Trust. Ultimately, the inner circle of this group arrived at the idea of the "three-bloc world." It was believed that this system could force Germany to keep the peace (after it absorbed Europe) because it would be squeezed between the Atlantic bloc and the Soviet Union, while the Soviet Union could be forced to keep the peace because it would be squeezed between Japan and Germany. This plan would work only if Germany and the Soviet Union could be brought into contact with each other by abandoning to Germany Austria, Czechoslovakia, and the Polish Corridor. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This became the aim of both the anti-Bolsheviks and the three-bloc people from the early part of 1937 to the end of 1939 (or even early 1940). </strong></span></span>These two cooperated and dominated the government in that period. They split in the period 1939-1940, with the "three-bloc" people, like Amery, Lord Halifax, and Lord Lothian, becoming increasingly anti-German, while the anti-Bolshevik crowd, like Chamberlain, Horace Wilson, and John Simon, tried to adopt a policy based on a declared but unfought war against Germany combined with an undeclared fighting war against the Soviet Union. The split between these two groups appeared openly in public and led to Chamberlain's fall from office when Amery cried to Chamberlain, across the floor of the House of Commons, on May 10, 1940, "In the name of God, go!"<br><br>     Outside these two groups, and much more numerous (but much more remote from the real instruments of government), were the appeasers and the "peace at any price" people. These were both used by the two inner groups to command public support for their quite different policies. Of the two the appeasers were much more important than the "peace at any price" people. The appeasers swallowed the steady propaganda (much of it emanating from Chatman House, The Times, the Round Table groups, or Rhodes circles) that the Germans had been deceived and brutally treated in 1919. For example, it was under pressure from seven persons, including General Smuts and H. A. L. Fisher, as well as Lord Milner himself, that Lloyd George made his belated demand on June 2, 1919, that the German reparations be reduced and the Rhineland occupation be cut from fifteen years to two. The memorandum from which Lloyd George read these demands was apparently drawn up by Philip Kerr (Lord Lothian), while the minutes of the Council of Four, from which we get the record of those demands, were taken down by Sir Maurice Hankey (as secretary to the Supreme Council, a position obtained through Lord Esher). It was Kerr (Lothian) who served as British member of the Committee of Five which drew up the answer to the Germans' protest of May, 1919. General Smuts was still refusing to sign the treaty because it was too severe as late as June 2 3, 1919.<br><br>     As a result of these attacks and a barrage of similar attacks on the treaty which continued year after year, British public opinion acquired a guilty conscience about the Treaty of Versailles, and was quite unprepared to take any steps to enforce it by 1930. On this feeling, which owed so much to the British idea of sportsmanlike conduct toward a beaten opponent, was built the movement for appeasement. This movement had two basic assumptions: (a) that reparation must be made for Britain's treatment of Germany in 1919 and (b) that if Germany's most obvious demands, such as arms equality, remilitarization of the Rhineland, and perhaps union with Austria, were met, Germany would become satisfied and peaceful. <img src="http://home.zonnet.nl/gerardvonhebel/euro1938.GIF" alt="" width="849" height="723"></p>
              <p>The trouble with this argument was that once Germany reached this point, it would be very difficult to prevent Germany from going further (such as taking the Sudetenland and the Polish Corridor). Accordingly, many of the appeasers, when <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>this point was reached in March 1938 went over to the anti-Bolshevik</strong></span> or "three-bloc" point of view, while some even went into the "peace at any price" group. It is likely that Chamberlain, Sir John Simon, and Sir Samuel Hoare went by this road from appeasement to anti-Bolshevism. At any rate, few influential people were still in the appeasement group by 1939 in the sense that they believed that Germany could ever be satisfied. Once this was realized, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">
              </span></span></p><h1>it seemed to many that the only solution was to bring Germany into contact with, or even collision with, the Soviet Union.</h1>
              <br><br>     The "peace at any price" people were both few and lacking in influence in Britain, while the contrary, as we shall see, was true in France. However, in the period August 1935 to March 1939 and especially in September 1938, the government built upon the fears of this group by steadily exaggerating Germany's armed might and belittling their own, by calculated indiscretions (like the statement in September 1938 that there were no real antiaircraft defenses in London), by constant hammering at the danger of an overwhelming air attack without warning, by building ostentatious and quite useless air-raid trenches in the streets and parks of London, and by insisting through daily warnings that everyone must be fitted with a gas mask immediately (although the danger of a gas attack was nil).<br><br>     In this way, the government put London into a panic in 1938 for the first time since 1804 or even 1678. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>And by this panic, Chamberlain was able to get the British people to accept the destruction of Czechoslovakia, wrapping it up in a piece of paper, marked "peace in our time," which he obtained from Hitler, as he confided to that ruthless dictator, "for British public opinion." </strong></span></span>Once this panic passed, Chamberlain found it impossible to get the British public to follow his program, although he himself never wavered, even in 1940. He worked on the appeasement and the "peace at any price" groups throughout 1939, but their numbers dwindled rapidly, and since he could not openly appeal for support on either the anti-Bolshevik or the "three-bloc" basis, he had to adopt the dangerous expedient of pretending to resist (in order to satisfy the British public) <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>while really continuing to make every possible concession to Hitler which would bring Germany to a common frontier with the Soviet Union,</strong></span></span> all the while putting every pressure on Poland to negotiate and on Germany to refrain from using force in order to gain time to wear Poland down and in order to avoid the necessity of backing up by action his pretense of resistance to Germany. This policy went completely astray in the period from August 1939 to April 1940...<p></p>

              <p>If Hitler had crossed the channel to invade Britain in 1940 he would had won the war.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Georgia,Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Mao: 
                                                Hitler was then really terrific, having occupied 
                                                almost the whole of Europe, excepting east of the 
                                                Moscow-Leningrad-Stalingrad front. And not counting 
                                                United Kingdom. He occupied North Africa as well. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Georgia,Times New Roman,Times,serif;">However, he blundered: <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>If after the Dunkirk evacuation 
                                                his troops had immediately followed into the United 
                                                Kingdom, the latter would have been at the end of 
                                                its tether. A British prime minister told Premier 
                                                Zhou Enlai in Geneva that the United Kingdom had 
                                                no more troops at all then, and it was vulnerable 
                                                everywhere. </strong></span></span>However, the Germans hesitated to drive 
                                                forward just because of the English Channel. </span></p>

              <p>Or had Hitler decide to back the ukrainian nationalists during the invasion of Soviet Union, he could had won the war with the USSR.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>...As a consequence of the shift of emphasis to the south, German Army Group South completed a colossal envelopment east of Kiev (August 24-September 21). In a great bag 200 miles wide, the Germans captured 665,000 prisoners with 3,718 cannon and 884 tanks. Hitler called this "the greatest battle in the history of the world"; his chief of staff called it "the greatest strategic blunder of the Eastern Campaign."<br><br>     <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>At this point in the campaign a curious phenomenon appeared: large numbers of anti-Stalinist Russians began to surrender to the Nazis. Most of these were Ukrainians, and the majority were eager to fight with the Nazis against the Stalinist regime of the Soviet Union.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>If the Nazis had been willing to cooperate with this movement, and to treat these deserters in a decent fashion, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>it is extremely likely that the flood of Russian deserters would have become an overwhelming torrent and the Moscow regime would have collapsed. </strong></span></span>Instead, the Nazis, led by Hitler, resolutely refused to adopt the role of "Liberator of the Slavs," and instead insisted on playing the role of "Annihilator of the Slavs." The arrogance, sadism, and racism of the Nazi system soon presented itself in a form as hateful to the average Slav as Stalinism itself.</p>
              <p>As soon as the conquering German armies seized Soviet territory, various Nazi and satellite organizations of exploitation, of enslavement, and of extermination moved in, led by the SS. Prisoners of war and civilians were rounded up by the millions and deported to German slave-labor camps where they were starved, frozen, and beaten into subhuman derelicts at the very time that they were expected to work, fifteen or more hours a day, on Nazi war production.</p>
              <p>Those inhabitants of conquered areas who escaped deportation or imprisonment generally were deprived of most of their possessions, especially of their food stores and livestock. All industrial equipment which had not been removed by the retreating Soviet armies was stolen or destroyed by the Nazis.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The deserters who wished to fight with the Nazis against Stalin would have been welcomed by many German Army officers, but their use in this fashion was generally discouraged and frequently forbidden by the Nazi political leaders such as Hitler or Himmler. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>In spite of this, some Russian units in the Nazi armies were formed, although generally they were used only for guard or garrison duties. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The size of this movement of anti-Stalinist deserters can be judged from the fact that, in spite of the obstacles we have mentioned, the number of such deserters serving in the Nazi armed forces reached 900,000 in June 1944...</strong></span></span></p>

              <p>How Germany could had won the war may be a thesis.</p>
              <p>But Britain's agenda of instigating a war between Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia is not a thesis.</p>
              <p>It is a fact.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>...And by this date, certain members of the Milner Group and of the
                  <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>British Conservative government had reached the fantastic idea that
                  they could kill two birds with one stone by setting Germany and Russia
                  against one another in Eastern Europe.  </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>In this way <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>they felt that the
                  two enemies would stalemate one another</strong></span></span>, or that Germany would become
                  satisfied with the oil of Rumania and the wheat of the Ukraine.  It
                  never occurred to anyone in a responsible position that Germany and
                  Russia might make common cause, even temporarily, against the West. 
                  Even less did it occur to them that Russia might beat Germany and thus
                  open all Central Europe to Bolshevism...</p>
              <p>This idea of bringing Germany into a collision with Russia was not to
                  be found, so far as the evidence shows, among any members of the inner
                  circle of the Milner Group.  Rather it was to be found among the
                  personal associates of Neville Chamberlain...</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Some of you may have doubts after long years of brainwashing by british propaganda and may not be willing to accept this fact, but the evidence is conclusive.</p>
              <p>This view that Britain deliberately sought to set Germany against Russia is also not taught in our schools.</p>
              <p>The view that is taught is british false propaganda; a complete falsehood.</p>
              <p>Of course after years of hearing one version of events, suddenly I go and tell you that version is bullshit and another version is the truth, most would find it hard to adjust.</p>
              <p>But there are many facts and sources to examine if people are interested to find out more.</p>

              <p>Can, but not all at the same time.</p>
              <p>The Germans pushed all the way to Moscow, but then Hitler made several key strategic errors, mainly splitting up forces to capture lots of different places (far from one another) at the same time, rather than concentrate his forces. And his generals just could not get him to change his mind most of the time.</p>

The United States today finds herself confronted<br> by a hostile Germany and Italy in Europe and by an
                          equally<br> hostile Japan in the Orient. Russia, the great land link
                          between<br> these two groups of hostile powers, is at present
                          neutral, but<br> in all probability favorably inclined towards the Axis
                          powers,<br> and her favorable attitude towards these powers may be
                          expected<br> to increase in direct proportion to increasing success in
                          their<br> prosecution of the war in Europe. Germany and Italy have
                          been<br> successful in war on the continent of Europe and all of
                          Europe<br> is either under their military control or has been forced
                          into<br> subservience. Only the British Empire is actively
                          opposing by<br> war the growing world dominance of Germany and Italy and
                          their<br> satellites.<br> <br> 2. The United States at first remained coolly aloof<br> from the conflict in Europe and there is considerable
                          evidence<br> to support the view that Germany and Italy attempted by
                          every<br> method within their power to foster a continuation of
                          American<br> indifference to the outcome of the struggle in Europe.
                          Paradoxically,<br> every success of German and Italian arms has led to
                          further<br> increases in United States sympathy for and material
                          support of<br> the British Empire, until at the present time the United
                          States<br> government stands committed to a policy of rendering
                          every<br> support short of war the changes rapidly increasing that<br> the United States will become a full fledged ally of the
                          British<br> Empire in the very near future. The final failure of
                          German<br> and Italian diplomacy to keep the United States in the
                          role of<br> a disinterested spectator has forced them to adopt the
                          policy of<br> developing threats to U.S. security in other spheres of
                          the world,<br> notably by the threat of revolutions in South and Central
                          America<br> by Axis-dominated groups and by the stimulation of Japan
                          to further<br> aggressions and threats in the Far East in the hope that
                          by these<br> mean the Unites States would become so confused in
                          thought<br> and fearful of her own immediate security as to cause her
                          to<br> become so preoccupied in purely defensive preparations as
                          to<br> virtually preclude U.S. aid to Great Britain in any form.
                          <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>As a<br> result of this policy, Germany and Italy have lately
                          concluded<br> a military alliance with Japan directed against the
                          United States<br> If the published terms of this treaty and the pointed<br> utterances of German, Italian and Japanese leaders can be
                          believed,<br> and there seems no ground on which to doubt either, the
                          three<br> totalitarian powers agree to make war on the United
                          States,<br> should she come to the assistance of England,</strong></span></span> or should
                          she<br> attempt to forcibly interfere with Japan's aims in the
                          Orient and,<br> [2]<br> furthermore, Germany and Italy expressly reserve the
                          right to<br> determine whether American aid to Britain, short of war,
                          is a<br> cause for war or not after they have succeeded in
                          defeating<br> England. In other words, after England has been disposed
                          of<br> her enemies will decide whether or not to immediately
                          proceed<br> with an attack on the United States. Due to geographic
                          conditions,<br> neither Germany nor Italy are in a position to offer any<br> material aid to Japan. Japan, on the contrary, can be of
                          much<br> help to both Germany and Italy by threatening and
                          possibly even<br> attacking British dominions and supply routes from
                          Australia,<br> India and the Dutch East Indies, thus materially
                          weakening<br> Britain's position in opposition to the Axis powers in
                          Europe.<br> In exchange for this service, Japan receives a free hand
                          to seize<br> all of Asia that she can find it possible to grab, with
                          the<br> added promise that Germany and Italy will do all in their
                          power<br> to keep U.S. attention so attracted as to prevent the
                          United<br> States from taking positive aggressive action against
                          Japan.<br> Here again we have another example of the Axis-Japanese<br> diplomacy which is aimed at keeping American power
                          immobilized,<br> and by threats and alarms to so confuse American thought
                          as to<br> preclude prompt decisive action by the United States in
                          either<br> sphere of action. It cannot be emphasized to strongly
                          that<br> the last thing desired by either the Axis powers in
                          Europe<br> or by Japan in the Far East is prompt, warlike action by
                          the<br> United States in either theatre of operations.<br> <br> 3. An examination of the situation in Europe leads<br> to the conclusion that there is little that we can do
                          now,<br> immediately to help Britain that is not already being
                          done.<br> We have no trained army to send to the assistance of
                          England,<br> nor will we have for at least a year. We are now trying
                          to<br> increase the flow of materials to England and to bolster
                          the<br> defense of England in every practicable way and this aid
                          will<br> undoubtedly be increased. On the other hand, there is
                          little<br> that Germany or Italy can do against us as long as
                          England<br> continues in the war and her navy maintains control of
                          the<br> Atlantic. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The one danger to our position lies in the
                          possible<br> early defeat of the British Empire with the British Fleet
                          falling<br> intact into the hands of the Axis powers. The possibility
                          of<br> such an event occurring would be materially lessened were
                          we<br> actually allied in war with the British or at the very
                          least<br> were taking active measures to relieve the pressure on
                          Britain<br> in other spheres of action. To sum up: the threat to our
                          security<br> in the Atlantic remains small so long as the British
                          Fleet<br> remains dominant in that ocean and friendly to the United
                          States.</strong></span></span><br> <br> 4. In the Pacific, Japan by virtue of her alliance<br> with Germany and Italy is a definite threat to the
                          security<br> of the British Empire and once the British Empire is gone
                          the<br> power of Japan-Germany and Italy is to be directed
                          against the<br> United States. A powerful land attack by Germany and
                          Italy<br> through the Balkans and North Africa against the Suez
                          Canal<br> with a Japanese threat or attack on Singapore would have
                          very<br> serious results for the British Empire. Could Japan be
                          diverted<br> or neutralized, the fruits of a successful attack on the
                          Suez<br> Canal could not be as far reaching and beneficial to the
                          Axis<br> powers as if such a success was also accompanied by the
                          virtual<br> elimination of British sea power from the Indian Ocean,
                          thus<br> [3]<br> opening up a European supply route for Japan and a sea
                          route for<br> Eastern raw materials to reach Germany and Italy, Japan
                          must be<br> diverted if the British and American ( ) blockade of
                          Europe<br> and possibly Japan (?) is to remain even partially in
                          effect.<br> <br> 5. While as pointed out in Paragraph (3) there is<br> little that the United States can do to immediately
                          retrieve<br> the situation in Europe, the United States is able to
                          effectively<br> nullify Japanese aggressive action, and do it without
                          lessening<br> U.S. material assistance to Great Britain.<br> <br> 6. An examination of Japan's present position as<br> opposed to the United States reveals a situation as
                          follows:<br> <br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Advantages Disadvantages</strong></span></span><br> <br> 1. Geographically strong position 1. A million and a half

                          strong<br> defensive position and a navy and naval air force at
                          present<br> in that ocean capable of long distance offensive
                          operation. There<br> are certain other factors which at the present time are
                          strongly<br> in our favor, viz:<br> <br> A. Philippine Islands still held by the United States.<br> B. Friendly and possibly allied government in control<br> of the Dutch East Indies.<br> C. British still hold Hong Kong and Singapore and<br> are favorable to us.<br> D. Important Chinese armies are still in the field<br> in China against Japan.<br> E. A small U.S. Naval Force capable of seriously<br> threatening Japan's southern supply routes<br> [4]<br> already in the theatre of operations.<br> F. A considerable Dutch naval force is in the<br> Orient that would be of value if allied to U.S.<br> <br> 8. A consideration of the foregoing leads to the<br> conclusion that prompt aggressive naval action against
                          Japan by<br> the United States would render Japan incapable of
                          affording any<br> help to Germany and Italy in their attack on England and
                          that<br> Japan itself would be faced with a situation in which her
                          navy<br> could be forced to fight on most unfavorable terms or
                          accept<br> fairly early collapse of the country through the force of
                          blockade.<br> A prompt and early declaration of war after entering into
                          suitable<br> arrangements with England and Holland, would be most
                          effective<br> in bringing about the early collapse of Japan and thus
                          eliminating<br> our enemy in the pacific before Germany and Italy could
                          strike<br> at us effectively. Furthermore, elimination of Japan must
                          surely<br> strengthen Britain's position against Germany and Italy
                          and, in<br> addition, such action would increase the confidence and
                          support<br> of all nations who tend to be friendly towards us.<br> <br> 9. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It is not believed that in the present state of<br> political opinion the United States government is capable
                          of<br> declaring war against Japan without more ado; and it is
                          barely<br> possible that vigorous action on our part might lead the<br> Japanese to modify their attitude. Therefore, the

Make an arrangement with Holland for the use of<br> base facilities and acquisition of supplies<br> in the Dutch East Indies.<br> C. Give all possible aid to the Chinese government<br> of Chiang-Kai-Shek.<br> D. Send a division of long range heavy cruisers to<br> the Orient, Philippines, or Singapore.<br> E. Send two divisions of submarines to the Orient.<br> F. Keep the main strength of the U.S. fleet now in<br> the Pacific in the vicinity of the Hawaiian Islands.<br> G.

Completely embargo all U.S. trade with Japan,<br> in collaboration with a similar embargo imposed<br> by the British Empire.<br> <br> 10. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>If by these means Japan could be led to commit an<br> overt act of war, so much the better.

              </blockquote>
              <p>Here is an analysis of Japan's intentions:</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>By the beginning of 1941, the Japanese attack on China had bogged
              down and was in such imminent danger of collapse that something drastic
              had to be done. But there was no agreement within Japan as to what
              direction such drastic action should take. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>A timid majority existed,
              even within the Japanese government itself, which would have been
              willing to withdraw from the Chinese "incident" if this could have been
              done without too great "loss of face." On the whole, this group was
              timid and ineffectual because of the danger of assassination by the
              extreme militarists and hyper-nationalist groups within Japan.</p>
              <p>Moreover, it was impossible to reach any agreement with the Chinese
              Nationalist government which would allow Japan to retain its "face" by
              covering a real withdrawal from China with an apparent diplomatic
              triumph of some sort.</p>
              <p>The advocates of an aggressive policy in Japan were divided among
              the insignificant group who still believed that an all-out assault on
              China could be brought to a successful conclusion and the more
              influential groups who would have sought to redeem the stalemate in
              China by shifting the offensive against either Soviet Siberia or the
              rich Anglo-Dutch possessions of Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
              <p>In the long
              run, the group which advocated a drive to the south was bound to
              prevail, because Malaysia and Indonesia were obviously weak and rich,
              while Soviet Siberia lacked those items (such as petroleum, rubber, or
              tin) which Japan most urgently needed, and it had demonstrated its
              power in the battles of 1938-1939. Germany, which originally encouraged
              the Japanese to move southward against British Malaysia and then, when
              it was too late, sought to redirect the Japanese blow against Siberia,
              played an insignificant role in Japan's policy.</p>
              <p>The decision to move
              southward, where the defense was weaker and the prizes so much greater,
              was made in an ambiguous and halfhearted way in the summer of 1941. The
              critical turning point was probably during the last week in July...</p>
              <p>....As a result of these pressures, Japan found itself
              in a position where its oil reserves would be exhausted in two years,
              its aluminum reserves in seven months. The chief of the General Staff
              of the Japanese Navy told the emperor that if Japan resorted to a war
              to break this blockade it would be very doubtful that it could win. The
              president of the Japanese Planning Board confirmed this gloomy opinion.
              The armed forces insisted that Japan had a choice between a slow
              decline to extinction under economic pressure or war which might allow
              it to break out of its predicament. The navy had little hope of victory
              in such a war, but agreed with this analysis.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It was also agreed that
              war, if it came, must begin before the middle of December, when weather
              conditions would become too adverse to permit amphibious belligerent
              operations; it was clear that economic pressure was too damaging to
              allow Japan to postpone such operations until the resumption of good
              weather in 1942. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Accordingly, the decision was made to make war in
              1941, but to continue negotiations with the United States until late
              October. If an agreement could be reached by that date, the
              preparations for war could be suspended; otherwise the negotiations
              would be ended and the advance to open war continued. Matsuoka, the
              foreign minister, who was opposed to continuing the negotiations with
              the United States, was dropped from the Cabinet on July 16th; from that
              date on, the civilian portion of the Cabinet desperately sought to
              reach an agreement in Washington, while the military portion calmly
              prepared for war.</p>
              <p>In the course of 1941, Japan's preparations for
              war were gradually expanded from a project to close the southern routes
              into China by an attack on Malaya, to an attack on the United States.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The decision to close the Burma Road by force meant that Japan must
              move into French Indochina and Siam, and cross British Malaya, after
              neutralizing the British naval base at Singapore.</strong></span></span> Such a movement had
              numerous disadvantages. It would mean war with Britain; it would leave
              the Japanese lines of communication southward open to a flank attack
              from American bases in the Philippines; it was doubtful if China could
              be defeated even when all Western supplies were cut off (after all,
              these supplies were so insignificant that in 1940 American arms and
              munitions to China were worth only $9 million); even a total defeat of
              China would leave Japan's material shortages acute, especially in
              respect to the greatest material need, petroleum products.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In view of
              these disadvantages, under which Japan would expend so much to gain so
              little, it seemed to many Japanese leaders that very considerable gains
              could he obtained with only a slight additional effort if an attack on
              the rich Netherlands Indies were combined with the attack on Malaya and
              the Burma Road. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Such an advance to the tin and bauxite of Malaya and to
              the oil of the Dutch Indies had every advantage over any alternative
              possibility, such as an attack on eastern Siberia, especially as the
              Japanese Army (but not the Navy) had a higher opinion of Soviet power
              than they had of Anglo-American strength.</p>
              <p>Having given the attack on Malaya and Indonesia
              the preference over any possible attack on Siberia, the Japanese
              leaders accepted the fact that this would mean war with Britain and the
              United States. In this they were probably not wrong, although some
              Americans have claimed that America would not have gone to war if Japan
              had passed by the Philippines and left other American territories
              untouched on its road to the south.</p>
              <p>It is certainly true that such
              actions would have touched off a violent controversy within the United
              States between the isolationists and the interventionists, but it seems
              almost certain that the policies of the Roosevelt Administration would
              have been carried out, and these policies included plans for war
              against Japan's southern movement even if American areas were not
              attacked.</p>
              <p>In any case, judging American reactions in terms of their
              own, the Japanese decided that an American flank attack from an
              untouched Philippines on their extended communications to the southward
              would be too great a risk to run; accordingly, an attack on the
              Philippines to prevent this was included in the Japanese plans for
              their southern movement.</p>
              <p>This decision led at once to the next step, the
              project to attack the American fleet at Pearl Harbor on the grounds
              that an inevitable war with the United States could be commenced most
              effectively with a surprise attack on the American Navy rather than by
              waiting for an intact American fleet to come to seek out the Japanese
              in their zones of active operations in the southwestern Pacific.</p>
              <p>It
              must be recognized that one of the chief factors impelling the Japanese
              to make the attack on Pearl Harbor was that few Japanese (and these
              mostly in the army) had any hope that Japan could defeat the United
              States in any war carried to a decisive conclusion. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Rather, it was
              hoped that, by crippling the American fleet at Pearl Harbor, Japan
              could conquer such a large area of the southwestern Pacific and
              southeastern Asia that peace could be negotiated on favorable terms.</strong></span></span> Here, once again, the Japanese misjudged American psychology...</p>
