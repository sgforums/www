              <p>Me thinks just about the same, just that never say only.  =P</p>
              <p>Interesting how history textbooks omit whatever Westerners did to China in the past, except for "seeking new trade routes" and "missionary work" eh? Of course must add that Germany did take part in a small portion of China's bullying.</p>
              <p>Or Allied war crimes during and after WW2. Never heard/read about it, no?  =\</p>

              <p>not possible leh.....even if they can win fights with china, they cannot be able to conquer entire china. during WWII, even at their peak of power, japan only managed to capture a few cities in china (like less than 1% of the area of china) and we all know china has more than a thousand cities.</p>
              <p>further more, say, if japan conquers china, their fate will be like the american soldiers in Iraq and Afganhistan, with no end to the war in sight, as the bilions of chinese will rise up non-stop and the fighting can drag on till eternity.</p>

              <p>if i remember correctly, japan conquer china is because they always have bad blood with china way before even 19 century. these 2 countries always at loggerheads with one another and WW II is the breaking point for both.</p>
              <p>however, during WW II, japan's main reason to invade china is due to greed.</p>
              <p>they want china's natural resources (which is a LOT, btw).</p>
              <p>as if that's not enough, japan also want natural resources of the SE Asian countries.</p>

              <p>Would we in Singapore dreamed of visiting or to study in Berlin ? Would mixing Deutsch with our everyday language be considered fashionable, cool and hip? </p>
              <p>Would we still be complaining about our government and on how much better Berlin was being governed?</p>
