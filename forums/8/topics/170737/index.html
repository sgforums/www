            <div class='col-md body'>Hindu Beliefs and Practices<br>At the heart of Hinduism is the monotheistic principle of Brahman, that all reality is a unity; the entire universe is one divine entity. Deity is simultaneously visualized as a triad:<br>Brahma the Creator who is continuing to create new realities<br>Vishnu, the Preserver, who preservers these new creations. Whenever dharma (eternal order, righteousness, religion, law and duty) is threatened, Vishnu travels from heaven to earth in one of ten incarnations.<br>Shiva, the Destroyer, is at times compassionate, erotic and destructive.<br><br><img src="http://www.arches.uga.edu/~wolfcr78/images/hinduism.jpg"><br>This page gives a somewhat opinionated view on Hinduism in a the Matrix Trilogy. I found this information while searching around in forums for information on the Matrix. While, it may be an argument to illustrates the authors belief that Matrix Revolutions has many Hinduism elements, the information it presents is very accurate and suprising it is one of the best accounts of hinduism in the Trilogy that I have been able to find as of yet. If you want to learn more about Hinduism so that you can understand the information better, click here.<br><br>Now, Hinduism in the Matrix:<br><br>When Sati raises the sun, it symbolizes a new era or epoch. That's what Hinduism is divided into, epochs. The cycle is broken, but a new epoch exists. One in which man and machine are at peace. However, when Sati asks the Oracle if we'll see Neo again, she says "Maybe". You know why? Because Neo is DEAD. His code/spirit along with Smith's reloads the Matrix at the end. But he can be reincarnated if he is needed. Revolutions is about hindu philosophy. Reloaded was buddhist. By the way, while it isn't a matrix within a matrix, the IDEA of it is the same. In this one the idea is blink of vishnu, which is pretty much what matrix within a matrix is. However, it's not so blatant. Remember, Neo's powers EXTEND BEYOND the Matrix. Why is that? It's logically explained in the movie, but think of this: if we define reality by what we can and cannot do, and suddenly the powers that Neo has in the Matrix (due to it not being real) have transcended the Matrix, what does that imply about the real world? What does that imply about the very nature of reality? Answer: Reality is a matter of perception. the Matrix can be just as real as the real world. The real world may not even be that real anyway. In the Blink of Vishnu, Lord Vishnu dreams of a thousand universes that are created and destroyed within the blink of an eye. He wants to be close to man, but man rejects him and chooses suffering instead. But he comes down to earth in various incarnations to teach man how to become closer to God. Well, Neo meets one of those incarnations right at the beginning. Rama is an incarnation of Vishnu. He is the first program to exhibit a "human" emotion: love. He will lead the way for programs to become closer to humans. In the Matrix trilogy there is no real divine intervention (at least not blatant). Humans are considered as gods to the machines and programs, while programs and machines are equated to what we are right now. By the way, Neo is also representative of Vishnu. And Smith is representative of Shiva. Especially in the Superbrawl. It's a battle between Hindu gods, that's why the song is in Sanskrit (taken directly from the Upanishads, hindu texts). Vishnu is the protector of the world (like Neo is the protector of the Matrix), while Shiva is the destroyer of the world (like Smith is the destroyer of the Matrix). Many complain about the lack of ideas in Revolutions, but that's not true at all. remember, Reloaded and Revolutions were filmed at the same time. For a reason: they were meant to be a dialogue between Buddhism and Hinduism. In Buddhism, there is no end. It's all about cycles. That's the ultimate destiny of the One, which is proposed in Reloaded. No free will, you can't exert any change. You just follow the cycle of life. Neo rejects this destiny. In Revolutions, it's Hinduism, where he exerts his free will, there is nobody controlling his actions. Everything that has a beginning has an end. Even Neo, because he is an incarnation of Vishnu as well. And he accepts this (his own mortality) to destroy Smith. By the way, another reason to believe Neo is Vishnu and Smith is Shiva especially in the Superbrawl is because shiva is a part of Vishnu, just like Smith is a part of Neo. By the way, it's not that Neo is only Vishnu. He's also Buddha and Christ that's why you see him form a cross at the end. But he's nowhere near only Christ. IMHO, the Matrix trilogy owes more to eastern philosophy than Western.<br><br></div>
