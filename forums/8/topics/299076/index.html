No more match-making agencies for her, thank you very much.<br><br>After she failed to get results through a match-making agency, Ms Zhang Xue Hong, 42, opted for a do-it-yourself (DIY) 'manhunt'.<br><br>For the past two weeks, she has been sticking up notices on lamp-posts along Taman Warna and other streets in Holland Village.<br><br>Bemused residents have been seeing - alongside the usual notices for garage sales and lost pets - her handwritten personal ad, titled 'Marriage'.<br><br>It reads, in broken English: 'Looking for a sigle (sic) white aged between 42 to 60 as a mankind (sic) partner, please contact ms zhang.'<br><br>It lists a Singapore handphone number, a China telephone number and address, and her e-mail address.<br><br>When contacted, Ms Zhang, who lives in Tianjin, said that she has been to Singapore twice in search of her elusive 'white knight'.<br><br>She revisited Singapore last month after her first attempt five months ago through a local match-making agency was unsuccessful.<br><br>She returned to China on Monday as her social visit pass was about to expire.<br><br>Ms Zhang, who does not speak English, painstakingly used an electronic dictionary to translate the words.<br><br>'I didn't write anything about myself because my English is not good, and I was scared I would write wrongly,' said Ms Zhang, who describes herself as conservative, voluptuous, and fair with long flowing hair.<br><br>Armed with some 20 copies of her flier, she headed to Holland Village two weeks ago, because she had heard there are more Caucasians there.<br><br>She said: 'I want to find a white man. I'm Chinese so this might seem impolite, but I think European or American men are of better quality.<br><br>'They are better-educated, more cultured, and have better personal upbringing.'<br><br>Ms Zhang said she has had five or six boyfriends previously, all from China, but the relationships ended as either party found the other 'unsuitable' in the end.<br><br>She said she started hearing good things about Caucasians in the past three years from friends and even her older brother, who has an American friend teaching at Peking University.<br><br>LANGUAGE IS NO BARRIER<br><br>She said she was not concerned about the language barrier.<br><br>She said: 'A lot of Chinese people find white men overseas, and most of them also can't speak English at first. If there really is chemistry, it won't be a problem. You can communicate in other ways.'<br><br>So why Singapore?<br><br>Ms Zhang said she did her research, and found it would be very difficult to go to the US or Europe due to visa and other restrictions.<br><br>So she decided on Singapore, as it has a majority Chinese population, a substantial expat community, and is a relatively safe country.<br><br>She paid more than 3,000 yuan ($600) to come here in June, on a one-week free-and-easy tour to Singapore and Malaysia.<br><br>She immediately scoured the Chinese newspapers here, and following an advertisement, went to First Overseas International Matchmaker at Katong Shopping Centre to pay $20 to register as a member.<br><br>In her application, she stated she was looking for either Europeans, Americans or outstanding Singaporean men who earn between $3,000 and $6,000 a month, live in private property, and preferably, run their own businesses.<br><br>She also wrote that she's 1.55m tall, weighs 50kg, earns 1,000 yuan a month, and loves reading, music and travel.<br><br>Ms Zhang even skipped the Malaysia leg of the tour in hopes of a match. She called the marriage agency several times after she returned home but there was no match.<br><br>Agency owner Francis Toh, 53, said given her requirements, it was very difficult to find a mate, and his employees had explained that to her when she registered with them.<br><br>He said: 'We do not guarantee a match. It's not that if you want a man who earns so much money and lives in private property, you will definitely get him by paying $20.'<br><br>Last month, Ms Zhang decided to make a second, 16,000 yuan one-month trip to Singapore.<br><br>She stayed at a budget hotel in Chinatown for a week, before moving to a friend's house in Redhill to cut costs.<br><br>So did she get any response to her fliers?<br><br>Ms Zhang said she received one phone call about a week ago.<br><br>'But it was from a withheld number, and he spoke English, so I couldn't understand him. I asked him to speak in Mandarin, but he couldn't, then he hung up,' she said.<br><br>Most residents in the neighbourhood where Ms Zhang's fliers were found were mixed in their views.<br><br>Their reactions to her ranged from 'funny' to 'desperate' to 'very bold.'<br><br>NTU lecturer Andrew Duffy, 42, who called The New Paper hotline after spotting the flier while visiting a friend, said jokingly: 'It's good marketing!'<br><br>One female resident, who declined to give her name, said she even spotted two Caucasian men taking pictures of the sign on the lamp-post one morning.<br><br>A married male Australian resident, 59, who declined to give his name, said that he would never respond to such an ad, even if he was single.<br><br>But his wife, 60, said that in their country, there are men who go overseas to find Asian women willing to live in remote areas of Australia with them - because many Australian women are unwilling to do so.<br><br>'They could have happy marriages and have children,' she said.</div>
