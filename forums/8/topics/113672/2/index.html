            <div class='col-md body'>hi friend, i know how u feel know..maybe i'll juz share wif u my story below.. :<br><br>The first time i saw her was about 2 years ago, when i was still year 1 in poly, at yishun mrt station platform. 1 week about 3 to 4 times, i sure will take the same train as her and in the same cabin. I was at first attracted by her stuffs,but not her..haha..yes it's true..because i've never seen a girl that is so hardcore about camouflage stuffs and army pictures..and the moment i look at her, she gave me a very special feeling. The feeling was very unexplanable,even until now. I didn't know who was she then and i also did not have the courage to go up and know her...But 1 thing i know about her, she's a SP student too..<br>It was until one fine morning, when i was taking a lift from my father to attend my unit's training, i saw her again at a road junction in yishun..then i finally know that she's also in NCC! Hmm..from then, i was very eager to know which element she's from and what district,if she's from land..But definitely, not from Central..<br>I enjoyed the mornings when i was able to see her. She and I will always take the first blue cabin. There was 1 day when i went late to school because i was running a camp at my unit, i was so shock to saw her on the platform too..haha..but after the end of that semester, she never appeared on yishun mrt station platform again..I told myself, maybe timetable different already.nvm..<br>After that, I never saw her again liao until when i host the ICEP cadets in 2003.I was very happy and glad that i saw her.I slowly began to observe her and knew her name and her background.And for one moment of time,during the ICEP dinner, our relationship became so close. Maybe was my lameness and the "yam seng" thingy that brought us together..haha.And that was the night,i finally got her number..haha.<br>The last few days of the ICEP,i wasn't around.Went to Malaysia.Before i went,she asked me to help her buy bubble gums,in which i really did..i think that,i was again 1 step closer.After since,we never contact each other again..until 1 day,while i was having lecture,she smsed me..(details no need to spill out lah..i swear not mushy mushy or confession type). Ever since then, i told myself to take 1 big step out and try "minimising the gap". Well,it kinda works.<br>Until the eve of my 1st TP driving test,29 march 2004,i really cannot tahan liao..i feeling for her was too strong and i wanted to let her know.i really wanted to be with her..I picked up alot of courage and sms her..as expected,got rejected..cos she treat me as her very good friend..<br>Though i told her i understand and will remain as friends,my feeling for her is still there..juz can't forget..i told myself try to give it up many times,but i can't..<br>juz a few months ago, she gaved me 1 fighting fish...i treasured it so dearly..treated it very well..but in the end,time was up for the fish and the fish died..i was so sad..i lost the only precious gift that she gave me..(besides the naruto hp chain)..But luckily she understood and never "kill" me.<br>Friends told me to forget abt her and carry on..but she has been constantly giving me hopes..hai..dunno wat to do..some time damn pissed off with her oso..like to give me empty promises..sad..</div>
