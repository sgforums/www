            <div class='col-md body'>This topic is not meant not be provocative... its meant to be solemn and serious. I know this seems a funny topic to post here in the sense that the S'pore internet scene is still english dominant...<br><br>Just that I hv so many frens who either are very poor in chinese language itself, or do not like the language at all, or are very inept in chinese culture, which leads me to think that S'pore chinese do not really care whether they are chinese or not, isit?<br><br>I do think that due to chinese being a majority in the country, you do not face many racial problems and thus leads to the corrosion of the chinese culture itself, in the notion that when any race face discrimination, they will then stand up to defend themselves, which in turn will up the level of respect for their own culture in the process. Understand what I'm writing? When I read, I also a bit blurr...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>and s'pore chinese also seems to look down on native chinese working in s'pore, which I dun understand why.... maybe they are more crazy over cheap stuff becos they are poor, or maybe they are snobbish in outlook to you due to different background, or maybe of other factors... but ultimately, they are people of your own skin... why look down on them???<br><br>And on culture... seems like the chinese hv very little, or in fact no knowledge on chinese culture at all...<br><br>not trying to be racist here... but just puzzle why chinese are receiving such treatment in a chinese dominant society... I understand racism perfectly, but racist against your own race... something new to me...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Pls do not make this post a discussion on racism in s'pore... this post is suppose to discuss S'pore chinese and their treatment of chinese culture and native chinese workers... another topic is posted to discuss the nationalist thing, which you can input your views there... I do not wish to distract people fm the chinese culture discussion... thks!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>For those who wish to know, I'm a malaysian who respect s'pore very much for it's achievement as compared to my country... and I'm defintely not racist... just bochup...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Whens the end coming?

            <div class='col-md body'>Well...As for me I like the Chinese culture, I love Chinese Literature, arts and their language. I can speak Mandarin fluently too. I mean I believe it is a culture that is meant to preserve for a long run...<br><br>But Tamils in SG does not like the Indians from India too. Cos they think they are poor and not qualified enuff or something like that. I have heard from the news that only SG Chinese does not want to be a Chinese if they have a chance, they would rather be a Japanese or a westerner...Why?? Blame the government for not incorporating enuff on chinese and culture...<br><br>I know there are ppl whose proficiency in Mandarin is low becos they seldom use the language but they can write well though.<br><br>Well...at least I am proud to be a Chinese in the least.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From the title of the topic, I find the answers u're looking for from fellow forumites quite ambiguous.<br><br>The title itself suggests whether s'porean chinese values culture from our very origin, China. And you mentioned about discrimination in ur latter part of the thread.<br><br>On culture,<br>This may come as festivals, gestures etc. If so, I would say the chinese culture in s'pore is somewhat fading in the younger breed of people around in this country.<br>Maybe coz there's not enough exposure of the young to it?<br>Try asking a teen on the streets:<br>"Ni zhi bu zhi dao Duan Wu Jie shi zai ji shi?"<br>6 out of 10 or more won't be able to give u the answer.<br>More common ones like CNY, then maybe. (AngBaos!!!)<br>As for gestures, maybe things like 'respecting the elders' and simpler ones are observed still.<br>Coming to arts, again we dun have much to see about cept fer the occasional exhibits around town. How many students nowadays do u really see taking higher chinese and chinese literature? Some schools even allow students to forgo chinese as a subject and take up another language, for eg, French.<br>The point here is, it's not that S'pore chinese dun value their cultures, but becoz they are not properly taught to appreciate it from a very tender age.<br><br>On discrimination of chinese from China, it's not uncommon. Why? I dun really know.<br>Maybe coz of the behaviour? U muz know that it's really different being a chinese here and one in the very far east.<br>We tend to make fun of them, blame their communist background? Hehehe. (TongZhi ni hao!!!)<br>When they come to our country, it can't be helped if they're viewed as 'aliens'.<br>We do, of course, know they're all like us. Homosapiens? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br>I'm neutral on this topic  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>Dun get me wrong, but i do have a close fren who's engaged to a chinese expat. She's only 20 and quite a babe. So, it really depends on individuals whether discrimination is evident.<br><br>Rinoa : True that local indians do not like the bangladesh people coming here.<br>Status difference is the main reason and u're right on abt the them being uneducated and poor as viewed by local indians.<br>Well, at least they provide a commendable number of construction workforce to the local community. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br>But I will still avoid taking buses and trains to town areas on Sunday. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">PP<br><br>Jaa ne~~~<br><br>------------------<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>To see a world in a grain of sand<br>And a heaven in a wild flower,<br>Hold infinity in the palm of your hand<br>And eternity in an hour.<br>-William Blake<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Takai, good point that my subject and the things discussed does not really match... some info to share with you... while I was writing this topic, the look down on chinese thingy came into my mind, and I started writing that, then found that it seems linked to racism, and I started a new topic(writing both at the same time)... but somehow, the looking on chinese thing still seems relevant to me, in the sense that if thye do not value their chinese culture, and that they do not see themselves as chinese, then may lead to the look down on chinese thing again... it seems related here and there, so I wrote it down... a bit long for an explaination huh....   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>As for chinese culture, its not just about general values like respect for elders, knowing the different festives(there are so many that I dun even know!)... it is also about understanding chinese literature, knowing chinese history(which is a very important part), the "tang shi", etc... I know "tang shi" is considered a bit out for many s'poreans, but it is a very important part of chinese cultural, as with other "shi" fm other dynasty, and "song ci", the chinese opera(I do admit that I like the stage opera quite a bit...)etc... woah... getting longer...  ;p<br><br>And people seems to hv forgotten their dialect, which IS another important aspect of chinese culture... and I do also like the hokkien operas very much... one story to share with you... my cousin was asked in class what she was her interest and when she replied hokkien operas, she immediately became a laughing stock of the class... another reflection on s'poreans' view on chinese culture.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  one thing though... even if anyone devotes the whole of their life to learning chinese and its culture, there will still be no way that they can become expert in all fields...<br><br>something irrelevant... when I type "chinese culture", i always typed it into "chinese cultural", and got to back space to change it... any of you face this problem? or its just me?<br><br>------------------<br>Whens the end coming?

            <div class='col-md body'>hi bochup,I don't think s'pore chinese are racist to mainland chinese.  To be racist is to imply that we hate them deeply.  rather I think sometimes we laugh at them because of the perceived backwardness of mainland chinese.  I have from afar observed that chinese academics &amp; exchange students are treated well  because, I guese, being intellectaul &amp; sophisticated would put one in good light in any society.<br><br>As u mentioned it is important to know chinese literature &amp; history as part of knowing chinese culture.  but I m afraid in S'pore students already don't pay attention lit &amp; s'pore history.(i got D7 &amp; B4 respectively) cos maths &amp; science are what is emphasised &amp; ultimately counts.  anyone heard of lit or hist tuition??  nope!<br><br>I also don't think we look down upon chinese lang &amp; culture.  when I was in NS 2 yrs ago most of platoon listen to 93.3 most of the time and I did feel left out. tho I like Faye Wong now.  the pop culture scence is alive n well.  tho yes sadly traditional culture is on the wane.<br><br>I have this theory that christianity plays a part in the erosion of traditional chinese culture.  esp now charismatic movement rapidly gaining new converts.  Christianity is an exclusive faith.  when one becomes a Christian he not only has to renounce other gods (thus some parents unhappy that kids don't worship ancestors anymore) but one is immersed into a church culture itself which is very westernised.  What do u think?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mateo, for a moment, I thought u're a fan of Roberto di Matteo(Chelsea) or Dominic Matteo (Liverpool)....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I agree very much with you that Christianity does play a part to a certain extent, but due to the sensitivity of such issues, I rather we not dwell too much into the talk of impact of a religion to chinese culture... the topic makes sense(and is reasonable!), but may become too hot to handle and arguments may boil to the level of abuse... I rather not take the risk.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>and talking about the pop scene... I do credit HK pop for carrying people's interest in chinese and cantonese up, but they can only do so much.... and what good does it do when hokkien, teochew, hakkah, etc, etc learns how to speak cantonese but dunno how to speak their own dialect? It probably kill the odd dialect group off...<br><br>I'm a hokkien and speaks the dialect itself quite fluently, but somehow, I still feel handicapped when using the language to communicate in depth... this shows how bad the dialect standard hv dropped in s'pore.<br><br>I hate to say this about FM93.3 chinese station, but their standard of chinese is atrocious, and many of their DJs simply hv bad taste... they can help improve the standard of chinese in s'pore becos the standard here is already at rock bottom...<br><br>but new textbooks hv improved quite a bit, and MOE seems to understand that older texts hv simply too low a standard for s'poreans to compete with any of the chinese teaching country, thus the new texts...<br><br>I heard that the S'pore Uni debate team was formed by all native chinese for the last Worldwide Unversity Chinese debate competition... is it true?<br><br>------------------<br>Whens the end coming?
