The interest rate might go up depending on the market, depending on the reserve bank. Now Australia is in an election period , I don't think the interest rate can go up any further until after the elections. The apartment prices are not going up as fast as the interest , so go figure.<br><br>The news is that because of the inflation and interest rates, no one really wants to buy and most cannot afford to buy. People are waiting for property prices to slum and developers who cannot afford to wait for the right prices will sell at firesales rate. Vultures are already circling and ready to swoop - if you get what I mean.  ***NEWS : Markets already crashing from the Dow Jones Dip- those who bought property on 75% of the value mortgage -  are going to be in trouble if they dabbled in stocks - aka firesales***<br><br>If US goes into recession and Australian economy gets affected , first to go are not the Australians <strong>but the foreign workers.</strong> And consider this - if you work under an AWA ( Australian Workplace agreement) - you are screwed both ways - more screwed than the Australians.<br><br>If I were you, just do nursing - it is the only profession unlikely to be affected in recession.<br></div>

The monthly living estimate given is 128000 per month bare minimum . Forget entertainment - you cannot afford it . Forget buying clothing - you cannot afford it. Not to mention - transportation costs.<br><br>Ok . You actually have to take a japanese entrance exam which consists of the japanese language and pass it for them to consider you for admission which takes 6months -2 years later - <span style="font-style: italic;">so the matter is whether they will accept you first.</span><br><br>Students health insurance 1000 yen per month .12000 per year<br>Undergraduate: Enrollment Fee: 282,000yen (about SGD 3600)<br>Tuition Fee: 535,800yen ( around SGD 7500dollars)<br>And tuition fees - I don't think it is so cheap for foreigners<br><br><strong><br>So yah , tuition fees cheap........living cost kills.</strong><br><br>The americans I know who lived in Japan - says that USA is cheaper to live in. Food is cheap ( and very unhealthy) . It is just the rentals but you do not need to worry if you live in a college dorm.<br><br>MIT tuition costs are higher but eating in USA is far  far cheaper than even in Australia . MIT has a range of scholarships for foreign students to apply to decrease cost of living if they are very talented to get into MIT . Japanese universities - they don't.  And Japanese tend to be more xenophobic towards chinese.<br><br>Besides that, if you think Singapore is a pressure cooker . Japan is EVEN WORSE for university students there.<br><br>Now think in terms of jobs, go back to Singapore or any english speaking country- you have to pay to translate your transcript to english. And if you want to stay in Japan - I heard permanent residency is not easy to acquire - not as easy as USA or Australia.</div>

He has not even said anything about the standard of his japanese language yet. There are people who work as a clerk but seriously how many are foreign students?<br><br>And like I said , it is whether tokyo uni want to accept him or not.  Frankly he might as well do a local degree in NUS which is recognised unless his family is damn rich and can afford either way .  Always cheaper to do it locally.</div>
