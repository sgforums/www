            <div class='col-md body'>Memo from General James to General Staff,<br><br>I fear gentlemen, very much fear we are going to fight a losing war on the Eastern Front. Yes, given the circumstances, there is no choice but to engage on several fronts. The enemies are known to overwhelm us by using such tactics. Several battles conducted on several fronts to confuse and further divide us.<br><br>Of course, if we had follow my report given in August, we might perhaps be more prepared to face this evil. To get the men in better shape and to further equipped us. Not to point finger gentlemen, I seem to hear very often this phase Â“it is far too early and time consumingÂ” being parroted around in the corridors of the Ministry. It is time to reap what we have sown for this past few months.<br><br>The men are demoralised. The equipment below fighting capabilities and logistics are a nightmare. The war is due to commence on the 31st of October and we all know, this is a war we canÂ’t afford to lose. I pray that we can perhaps hold them to a bloody draw. And that, gentlemen, is an optimistic forecast.<br><br>Yours truly,<br>General James<br><br>------------------<br>The heartless and souless fool.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Memo from Agent James to the office of Head Director<br><br>Sir,<br><br>Given your directive, we have actively searched out the spies and agent provocateurs. Pardon my language and manners, but the situation now is like a block of cheese, there are holes everywhere! The worst damage is to come from a certain female agent nick named Tet.<br><br>Form the surveillance we have conducted on her, she is an expert agent skilled in disinformation and she has the ears of General James, the commander in charge of the Eastern Front. I would stress that I have the utmost respect for the General but I feared he had been taken in by her. Yes sir, I question the ability of General James to tackle the enemies on the 31st of October. Agent Tet is going to be the ruin of the General, and sir, we both knew what females are capable of, especially well trained ones.<br><br>We canÂ’t afford to confront the General without any hard evidences but I believed she is the one enemy that is perfectly capable of destroying our war efforts. Sir, you put me in this position because you trust my instinct. And I hope you will further trust me for I am about to launch Operation TET with the aim of kidnapping her until the war is, according to the General Staff Office, over by the 14th of November. I await your instruction.<br><br>As always,<br>Your faithful employee,<br>Agent James<br><br>------------------<br>The heartless and souless fool.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Transcript from Reporter James to Reuters<br><br>Holy Moly! Yes sir, we are seeing a society on the fringe of war, literally! This is reporter james reporting to you live from<br><br>*Roar of siren going off *<br><br>and what we are seeing here is mass protest and demonstrations! Yes people, after the excitement of Sloloban and Yugoslavia, we see yet another display of peopleÂ’s power. And what is the people clamouring for? They are<br><br>* Shouts of anger and molotovs being thrown *<br><br>very against the idea of mobilising for war and frankly, I am apt to agree with them. The nation is not really for war and after a lure of 6 months, they are just not ready for the prospect of war. They are too used to the good life and now, this premonition of fighting again just ignites something in them.<br><br>* rapid chatter of rubber bullets and steel and flesh clashing *<br><br>But war is inevitable and it is going to happen whatever the people might say. The government is firm in their decision and war is what they are going to get. We can only pray for these people and hope they come to their senses.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dearest Tet,<br><br>By the time you read this, I would be in the Eastern Front, looking over the horizons at the enemy. The last few days, I have drilled my men hard and make sure the quartermaster is doing his job right. Due to the heavy burden place upon me, I fear I am falling ill soon. And all this is happening right at the start of the campaign.<br><br>But worry not, for am I not more than capable of handling myself? Do I not distinguish myself in the battle of A------, in which I was duly promoted to my current rank? True, I should have been in the General Staff if the battle had gone much better but I am satisfied with the arrangement because this is what I wanted out of my life.<br><br>I need to write to you to calm myself before the eve of every major battle. You know that very well and it had sort of become a ritual for me. And again, have faith in me and my grey matters. It will excel, or perish in doing so. Wish me lucked. Tomorrow, at 0900 sharp, shall be a glorious day for me.<br><br>Yours more lovingly,<br>James<br><br>------------------<br>The heartless and souless fool.</div>
