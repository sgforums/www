            <div class='col-md body'>a pathetic one i think...as an ARTS lover (dance and music)i think we relli have a lot of catching up to do...<br>the govt jus announced tt they are spending BIG MONEY to develop and encourage the ARTS in singapore...and have (high) hopes of being a technological, economical and cultural hub of the region (or is it the world?)...yes..they are goin to build concert halls...theatres...auditoriums...give grants and things like dat...but from my perspective...the arts is not something which survives on infrastructure and incentives...but comes within urself...the passion for arts...the interest and the determination in the field...<br>i can see that theatre is picking up...especially in chinese drama...but other areas such as dance, music and art are still stagnant...occassionally seeing a few ripples thats all...a large percentage of the audience is made up of the cast's family members and friends...i used to work at SISTIC...so i know the rough figures...(so far...except for Saltimbanco...the average turn-out for performances or concerts is 60%-70%...in which half of the tix were complimentary tix for family and friends...different case for zhang hui mei and dong li huo che concerts...)<br><br>i wanted to "study" dance at La-Salle after my A levels...but my mum shot me THAT LOOK and say,"wat are u goin to eat in the future? your dancing shoes?"...<br>singapore is too pragmatic a society...and i am not that WEI DA to sacrifice studies to pursue my interest...<br>a fren of mine wanted to apply for a scholarship to royal london school of music but her parents did not give her the green light...her parents are understanding ppl...but just not risk-takers in this sense...<br><br>sigH~ (again)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think by building good infrastructures is a very good START.<br><br>I myself is an Art lover and involved in production years ago at Kallang Theatre, WTC, Drama Centre, Black Box and the swimming pool of XXX Hotel (!!) And we do meet a lot of problems with infrastructures.<br>Jubliee Hall is deep, very good for drama. Kallang theatre is good for dance and musicals cos of the seating design. WTC is bad for drama cos the stage is super shallow but ok for cross-talks. Well, to me Victoria Theatre is still the best ! We have to change our scripts and prop designs numerous times just becos the infrastructure and facilities do not meet our requirements.<br><br>But compared to France and London, our theatres are just slightly better than a cinema ! Go to the Opera House and you will know wat i mean. The atmosphere there is superb. Really, and the atmosphere will affect your enjoyment.<br><br>We must also provide adequate infrastructures and facilities for foreign threatre groups to perform in Singapore. Some of their props are very high tech and sophisicated. If we cannot provide the infra and facilities, they cannot come ! How to interact then ?<br><br>Well, support from the public is definitely needed in Singapore. And I do see that people are more Arty Farty nowadays then 10 years ago. But we gotta work harder !<br><br>Btw, I used to like The Necessary Stage, Haresh Sharma is a great Playwright, but their recent productions are quite a disappointment ..... *sigh*<br><br>Hai(3) Yan(4) Den(3) Ren(2) De(3) Ju(3) Chang(3) and Shi(2) Jian(4) Hua(4) Ju(4) Tuan(2) are still high in standard  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>OH YEAH ! If the Taiwanese Dance Troup "Yun(2) Men(2) Wu(3) Ji(2)" comes to singapore, MUST GO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>got dream...but no $$$...<br>parents oso no approve...<br>cant expect me to jus pack up and leave this country in the middle of the nite...<br><br>at least i am trying hard to keep myself updated...i am currently waiting for entry into university...so rite now i am werking and attending my dance sessions...but i am afraid i am unable to juggle those when i started studying...i skipped a lotta practices and rehearsals when i was in JC becos STUDIES ARE MORE IMPORTANT blah blah blah...<br><br>me alone cant revive the arts scene (if we have one to call our own in the first place)...my dance instructor told us that arts is never profitable business...last time she has to fork out her own money to rent studios...as well as to pay for odds and ends...it is oso difficult to find sponsors for concerts or performances cos ppl dun believe they can get much out of arts...<br><br>sigH~ (yet again)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why not have a heart-to-heart talk with your parents ? Start with ur mum  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>A real heart-to-heart talk. Tell her your passion in dancing and beg for her understanding. Dun make the conversation sour, talk nicely, real nicely. Talk like an adult, calmly and gentlemanly. I believe your parents will listen.<br><br>But one thing i will have to highlight. Singapore is a very realistic society, so you still have to consider about money. So you should think about how you can earn yourself a living if you do take up dancing. I am not into this area so I cannot comment.<br><br>I will suggest you go down to Las .. ??? cannot spell, paisei, and tok to the teachers etc there and ask for advices. See wat job prospects you have if you take up dancing. If i did not remember wrongly, there is no "dancer" in the Career Guide 2000 (can be purchased at 7 eleven , MPH etc ) Know more about the courses they provide at Las ... see if they are wat you want.<br><br>There is a scholarship offered by Lasalle (finally can spell !!) SIA, details :<br><br>Degree conducted at LASALLE-SIA and awarded by partner university, Queensland University of Technology Bachelor of Arts (Dance)<br><br>Contact LASALLE-SIA for the scholarship before the closing date !!!<br><br>If you can get the scholarship, your future will be bright and perhaps your parents will not object anymore.<br><br>But a career is for life, do consider properly, dun do things out of implusion.<br><br>Good luck !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>another important ingredient for a vibrant for arts scene is a critical mass. suffering the curse of a small population, the ardent arts-patronisng core is too small to substantiate any profit nor to provide critical feedback.<br><br>its heartening to see the number of aspiring artists(es) here but careful soul-searching must prevail. the expected excitment and joy from pursuing an artistic existence must be measured against talent possessed. its all well and good to want to be an artist but as artists what do we have to offer the world which is already not there? do you have a voice that is unique, not only unique but relevant to a discerning audience? the arts is not a soft-option but the view prevails and continues to lures wide-eyed aspirants into an existence that may ultimately lead to disillusionment. the love for the arts, at the end of the day, must be distinguished from talent for the arts.<br><br>------------------<br>There are a number of mechanical devices which increase sexual arousal in women.

            <div class='col-md body'>T|red<br>Let me give u some encouragement...<br>My fren she has actually graduated forom La Salle in Dancing..and U know what, her parents were dead against it when she first told them about her dream to be a dancer...and they told her that they would not give her a single dime if she were to pursue her course of study...Guess what she did? Being such an uncomformist, she paid the school fees all by herself..working several part-time jobs and took up some bank loans...and she finally graduated...It is hard work but she did not regret at all...Went to see her performance, though she is not the most outstanding dancer but i can feel the beat in her heart knowing that she succeed..<br><br>Do u know the worst thing that can happen in your life is not following you dream...but to actually dun even try to know if your dream can become reality....<br><br>I came all the way here to Canada to study Psychology whcih my mum thinks is simply 'useless' in the aspect of the demand in SG...I mean who cares if SG wants me or not? It is MY interest and MY desire to be one...And I did go thru all the hard knocks before I can land here...Not all ppl are forunate to pursue what they want...U are a human being..not a tool to be manipulated...<br><br>If u want to do something..Do it!! What can u lose?Afraid that no one will employ you or you can't be as outstanding as the others?SG arts scene is improving and I think there is a ray of light in whatever u want to do...<br><br>Regret comes if you dun even know try.....<br><br>------------------<br>Writing is a weapon that is more powerful than a man's fist.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 15 March 2000).]</div>

I wanted to be a teacher.<br><br>Well, Tired, i would suggest that you spend more time trying to know yourself better, see wat are your strengths and interests, wat is the best for you in the long run. Maybe it is dancing, maybe not.<br><br>Try as many things as possible (not the bad things though!) Along the process, you'll know yourself better !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>nopez. not close to any relatives. by the way, i said that i'm not that independent, coz i don't think i dare and could support myself and my studies......anyway, back to where i was, my grandma dotes on me, but she respects my parents decision. anyway, who knows, she may even try to change my mind. u know, i really hate it when people start discussing something related to me behind my back. it's so irritating........that's why i don't really confide in anyone.....coz i'm scared that they'll go and tell my parents or something like that, and if THEY think that the idea i'm having is wrong, then they'll come and speak to me and try to change my way of thinking.......ok, i've sidetracked. sorry.....</div>
