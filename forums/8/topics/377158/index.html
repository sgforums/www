              <p><strong>No U-Turn Syndrome</strong> (<strong>NUTS</strong>) is a term first coined by <a title="Singapore" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore">Singapore</a> entrepreneur <a title="Sim Wong Hoo" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sim_Wong_Hoo">Sim Wong Hoo</a>, to prominently describe the social behaviour of <a class="mw-redirect" title="Singaporeans" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singaporeans">Singaporeans</a> having a mindset of compliance to higher authorities before proceeding with any action.</p>
              <p>In his book <em>Chaotic Thoughts from the Old Millennium</em>, he uses a comparison of <a class="mw-redirect" title="Traffic rules" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_rules">traffic rules</a> in Singapore to those found overseas, to describe the phenomenon : In Singapore, drivers are not allowed to make a <a title="U-turn" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-turn">U-turn</a> unless a sign specifically allows them to do so, while in some other
              countries drivers may make U-turns freely so long as the 'No U-turn'
              sign is not present. Following that, this analogy is used to explain
              the <a title="Red tape" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_tape">red tape</a> he has encountered with hard-nosed <a title="Bureaucracy" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy">bureaucrats</a>, which in turn stifles the very <a title="Creativity" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity">creativity</a> that the Singaporean government has been trying to promote in the recent years.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_U-Turn_Syndrome#cite_note-0"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>NUTS is also considered as one of the major criticisms of the rigid <a title="Education in Singapore" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Singapore#Criticisms">Singapore education system</a>,
              where students are taught from a young age to obey instructions in an
              unquestioning manner, in a society where grades and paper certification
              are emphasised at the expense of some life skills.</p>
