After all, the movie is about the book, not the other way round. LOTR was not tailored to sastify the ignorant american hollywood demographic, which you apperantly fall under in your crass and arrogrant deconstruction of this epic, but to people with more refined tastes and who prefer to give pause and enjoy the story, and of course, refrain from making vulgar and ah beng statements from their ignorance (guess who).<br><br>[quote]<strong>mistake no.2<br>wtf? invincible ghost army? simi lanjiao? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> </strong></blockquote></div></blockquote><strong>Ignorance, crassness, a vulgar and general lack of understanding and respect for source material on your part does not consitute a mistake on their part.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>[quote]<strong>mistake no.3<br>frodo as the hero. sam put in way more effort than frodo. hey he killed 3 orcs. what did frodo kill?</strong><br><br>Ah yes, spoken like a true mindless american type moviegoer who is concerned only about stacking bodycounts and insipid, overrendered explosions. The very kind who would fault Black Hawk Down's documentary storytelling as highly fictious without even researching source material on their part. FYI, Frodo is the ringbearer, carrying the ring of ultimate evil in middle earth with the power to destroy all that is good in the land, resist it's effects, and somehow triumph over it's evil to destroy it. Yes, it's safe to say Frodo's character in the movie is an effortless one to carry off. Maybe your measure of a hero is how many people you can hoot upside down, in which case you should go to Far East Plaza and learn some lessons in heroism.<br><br>Please.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><blockquote><strong>mistake no.4<br>does sauron have an unlimited supply of orcs?</strong></blockquote><br><br>No, but he sure has a large, large number of them. While finite, his army is more then enough to take massive losses and defeats in battles all around and still maintain a powerful presence. What did you expect, he's the main bad guy. Since when was sauron's massive army a mistake? It was never a mistake, it was just that way until a massively ignorant and yet puffed up in self-worth person came along and thought it was so.<br><br><blockquote><strong>mistake no.5<br>for the last scene, the boat scene. all the hobbits suddenly lost alot of weight and became the size of children.</strong></blockquote><br><br>Gee, that's some nice nitpicking on your part. Why not mention that some of the shots you could tell were obviously CGI or composited? Maybe if you can find a way to shrink full grown men into hobbits, I'm sure they'll apperciate your constructive input. Barring that, which I'm sure you do not have the solution, the vollective voice of the majority says this to you:<br><br>Shut up.<br><br><blockquote><strong>mistake no.6<br>"i'm not a man."</strong></blockquote><br><br>This is disturbing, it was clear that what she said was clearly correct. Having called this a mistake, one wonders if you are suffering from some form of gender identification disorder...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote><strong>mistake no.7<br>faramir has a very clever horse.</strong></blockquote><br><br>You apparently know little about horses and how intelligent they really are. Yes, trained horses are capable of reutning home without control once they have been set off (if you notice, the rider wasn't controling the horse either, it had been trained to act on cue, a far more difficult thing to do then riding back home on its own). It is by no means impossible and never was until you decided to come along and proclaim, in your infinite ignorance, that it was so.<br><br><blockquote><strong>mistake no.8<br>wasn't most of rohan's troops slaughtered in part 2 during the urukhai siege with only the king, aragorn and 3-4 riders left? where the fuuk they suddenly find 6000 troops?<br>and the king expected more than 12k?</strong></blockquote><br><br>You dolt, those extra troops also came from the Riders of Rohan Gandalf led in at the end of the Two Towers. More then enough. As usual, the mistake lies on your part again.<br><br><blockquote><strong>mistake no.9<br>forget the troops. where they get 6000 horses.</strong></blockquote><br><br>As above.<br><br><blockquote><strong>mistake no.10<br>they repaired the city of kings damn quick.</strong></blockquote><br><br>See the nitpicking rebuttal.<br><br><blockquote><strong>continuity is [b]HARD</strong>.</blockquote>[/b]<br><br>It sure is, no feature length movie is free of continuity errors. However, taking a pause and thinking about things isn't too hard, something sombody should try here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></strong></div>
