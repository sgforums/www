(Gimli's father)). and it was from this adventure that he acquired Sting (the orc detecting sword) and the mithril armour (that silver corset that Frodo wears). of cos, it was in the Hobbit where Bilbo found the Ring, encountered Gollum and did not kill him.<br><br>The Hobbit is actually a very entertaining book to read, unlike LOTR which is actually plunges into the history and culture of Middle-Earth.  Silmarillion (and the appendices in LOTR) gives u a historical insight of making of the Ring, the coming of the Elves, the rise and fall of Sauron etc. Not an easy book to read cos one kinda forgets the whole list of elven names. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i can try to answer some of them, but since I didn't read other Tolkien books I'm sure someone else can explain them better, especially the elves part:<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by spencer99:</div><div class="quote_body">I didn't read the book and don't intend to? I watched the film but must confess that I didn't really fully understand certain parts. However, I have some questions that I really want to know:<br><br>a. Why must Frodo leave together with the Elves?<br><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This one not very sure, but something to do with the fact that he was ringbearer, and in Galadriel's words (to Elrond) he was dead or will die, especially since the wound inflicted by the witch king never truly healed.</span>  </span><br><br>b. Why must all the Elves leave? Where are they going?<br><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The time of the elves has passed in Middle Earth.  This one very chim, talks about end of Third Age and all, but what it basically means is that with the fall of the power of the rings (of which the elves have 3), they no longer have a place in Middle Earth, which will be dominated by Men.  They are going to the Grey Havens, from where the elves originate, I would imagine??</span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </span><br><br>c. Some Elves went to Aragon's aid in LOTR II. What happened to them?<br><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I don't recall in the book that the Elves went to the aid of Rohan.  In fact, in the book it wasn't the banished Eomer and his faithful Rohirrim army that Gandalf managed to round up to come to Rohan's aid (they were already back fighting), but some other western folks (men), I think.  Since the story is cooked up by PJ, am afraid nobody can really answer your question, but presumably those who survived remained in Rohan to help defend it while the Rohan army went to Gondor's aid?</span></span><br><br>d. Why is Arwen dying initially?<br><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Arwen was never dying... just that by choosing to remain with mortal men, she's as good as giving away her life...</span></span><br><br>e. Why is Lord D**** (Steward of Gondor) so negative and think that they will surely lose?<br><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Because he has in his possession a palantir, similiar as the one that Pippin looked into, and he used it to try to foresee the battle.  Unfortunately, Sauron has control over what images are shown to him, and chose to reveal only the darkest moments.  That's why Denethor was misled into thinking there is no hope at all for Gondor. For me it was an important omission, because the kingdom of Gondor is the greatest amongs the western lands, and even the line of stewards are wise and well regarded, so it would have been inconceivable for Denethor to give up the fight so easily just because Boromir was dead </span></span><br></div></blockquote></div>
