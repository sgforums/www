It's called Just Games I think. Just tell them you want a modified Playstation 2<br>game console. They have two types, one is the Japanese version &amp; the other is the U.S. version. Get the U.S. version. They also have 2 types of consoles. One is the power cable directly plugged into the game console &amp; the other one is with the power transformer.<br>The game console + controller is around S$300plus. Can't remember the exact amount. They will try &amp; sell you other stuff for the PS2 like memory card, extra game controller, original games.<br>If you want to save some money, buy your PS2 games, memory cards &amp; extra game controller from J.B. The shop is above the McDonald's at Holiday Plaza. P.S.2 games are at about S$3 (6 ringgit) each. BTW the modified PS2 console can play DVDs (original &amp; pirated) and PS1 &amp; PS2 games (original &amp; pirated) but it can't play VCDs.</div>

Yes, I know what you mean. Actually those manning the<br>Causeway Checkpoint Customs are young NS guys want to show off only. I came across them before, saw this guy bought for his daughter a Barney the Dinosaur cartoon VCD also kena stop and his passport particulars taken down. They don't know the actual rules &amp; regulations. By right they're not supposed to do that. A regular Singapore Customs officer friend of mine who has been working there for 10 years now told me that you are allowed to bring in not more than 4 discs, be it DVDs, VCDs, game, music or software CDs. What are not allowed is Porn material, weapons &amp; firearms.</div>

I cannot find any site on this 2 chip for comparation. Which one is better?<br><br>And does messiah 2 pro = messiah 2 ver2?<br><br>And i had PS1, does the controller and memory card compatitable with PS2. If yes, then i no need them on PS2 which cost me $320 for the system.<br><br>thanks, after someone answer me, then i know what to buy</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I prefer DMS3 to Messiah chips....esp the one for v9 sets. Get one that doesn't need you to swap any boot disc when playing or changing games. From what I heard, DMS3 don't suck the power from your PS2 lens. It suck the power directly from the PS2 power supply.<br><br>Go check it up on Internet lor...sure got alot of websites talking about it. Make sure your PS2 model is above 50000 series, those under the 50000 series are older PS2 model. Just make sure you don't get ripped off by for buying an overpriced PS2 hor.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
