            <div class='col-md body'>To have a divorce, the couple needs to be separated for at least 3 years first.<br><br>The only party they have to see are lawyers (no other choice), who will do everything.  Lots of documents to sign, lots of agreements to make, lots of legal terms to understand, etc.  Matrimonial properties, kids, possessions, alimony, approval of the divorce itself, official date of the divorce, etc.<br><br>Marriage is a legal contract in the eyes of the law.  Thus, lawyers are needed to make the case for the matrimonial contract null and void....and it doesn't end there beacuse ultimately, they will also have to face a judge in court who will close the case!<br><br></div>

Just go to your lawyer. I dunno about legal aid though.<br></div>
