Hey I didn't say I didn't comb my hair or didn't wash my face.  There are many ways to look smart instead of piling a thick mountain layer of foundation , mascara, concealer , eye shadow and liner , blush and lipstick , and dressing up  with bloody uncomfortable heels like you are out for some big event premiere when it is actually a walk in bloody orchard road . There is such a thing as au naturel beauty , in case you have not noticed . I am who I am - not some made up pansy  .<br><br>Of course tshirt and jeans cannot be worn to a formal event but I am refering to casual outings.<br><br>AND YOU ARE AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF ASIAN GUYS WHO I AM TALKING ABOUT <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> .

Here most aussies whites , esp the young ones, don't know how to deal with us as much as we don't know how to deal with them. However u mention the word singapore and they go "  oh, u must be rich"".  You should see how the aussie born chinese chat with the aussie whites - to them it is comfortable because they both come from the same aussie culture.  Once u get invited to pub with them , you join em - that is where everyone loosen up and starts talking alot.<br><br>The british whites who work here are either backstabbers or they tell u off in ur face . The ones who tell you off in your face are the ones you mix with because you know when they are honest to tell u what is wrong but some singaporeans I know tend to go for the backstabbers because they sound so diplomatic and sweet  . Sweet talkers are the ones who want to screw you. Straight in your face type are those you can be friends with but never ever trust them . They still have the ability to squash u down like the backstabbers .<br><br>The american friend I have - very difficult to know how he is like the first time I met him . I had a  suspicion  about american guys that they want to screw around but he is alright . He ask me if I prefer a handshake or a hug. I said handshake . So he know his boundaries as well. He never calls our outings dates ...he calls them excursions  -  I think it is a friend friend thing with them . He never says no , he always says negative. I  asked him once if his blood is negative...it is funny when he responds " Oh , negative"  ( which sounds like o negative) then he realised what I did ...and went HELL NO...   Don't ever insult their country when they are busy criticising it because it is their constitutional right as an american to criticise it ...not yours if ur not american.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agree. It's the Singaporean culture that's so annoying to the world, even Li Ao has a problem with it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
