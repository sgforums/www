            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>The more I see posting about SPGs and white expatriates getting girls, the more it is starting to irritate me . I used to think white guys are scum due to singaporean socialising . Used to hate them like crazy , yeah they take jobs from singaporeans , yeah they take girls/guys from singaporeans etc. I have a newer perspective now .<br><br>I have been staying in Australia for quite a while .  I work in a majority caucasian organisation.  In Singapore , I don't get calls from colleagues who are concerned about me when I get admitted to hospital or sick . In Australia , my caucasian colleagues come and visit me in hospital , express their concern etc ,or give me a call to check how I am going.  Once , one of the caucasian neurosurgeons actually shifted  me into his busy schedule a few months ahead of his appointment load because my fellow nursing colleagues ( the white and singaporean ones) actually asked him for that favor to see me since I was a former nursing staff in the neurosurgical ward.  He is a nice guy who didn't wave me off on my concerns with my cervical and lumbar prolapsed discs. Sometimes I see him around and he asks how I am .  In Singapore , I don't really think that will happen unless you are actually a personal friend of a doctor or some powerful AND  rich fella.<br><br>I turn off one nice caucasian guy who liked me alot because of my parents' say so and my misguided notions especially when I thought of the SPG stereotype.  I literally told him  off stating that all white guys seem to think we asian girls are cheap etc .  He told me not to use racial overtones on him and not all white guys are after sex - yes some can be horny as hell  . They are basically as human as everyone else - they want friends too - people who they can discuss their interests, problems, ambitions and hopes  etc. They are physically more open because of how they were brought up . A hug and a kiss can be their normal greeting of saying hello . None of the caucasian guys dare to hug or kiss me because they know asian culture can be conservative regarding opposite gender contact . The girls , however , would hug me when they see me.<br><br>Now I have an american caucasian friend who I have a teenagelike crush on   . He is  cute and refreshing in many ways . So what ? Does that make me an spg ? He doesn't care how I dress - and I mean HOW I DRESS - I am tshirt and jeans type of person on my offdays  . I read how one girl says she has to dress skimpy to attract caucasian guys . Well THAT IS TRULY SAD . I don't need to dress skimpy to talk to one , let alone act like I don't mind their type of greeting.  He knows that I don't like to be hugged and kissed like the other caucasians and he respects that. He can be playful and smack me on my arm for fun but he doesn't even bother about my appearance . He will tell waitresses to back off  in a sarcastic tone if they try to pick him up when I am around him . Mind you even though I said Hey it is ok.  Our relationship is strictly platonic  .<br><br>Most asian guys I go out with wants me to dress up so that I can look nice to their friends ...really what kind of shat is that . My caucasian friends don't even care whether I put make up or not . If I look nice , they will complement me on it . If I look like crap , there is always a cafe we can relax and chit chat about everything under the sun.<br><br>I find that some singaporean guys have so much insecurities that they have to go picking on white people .  Oooh they take away our girls because they have bigger d**ks ...oooh they take away our jobs .  Not their fault it is happening -  some of you project a large amount of insecurity which turns people off whether guys or girls.  AS FOR THOSE GIRLS WHO THINK THAT THEY HAVE TO DRESS LIKE HOOKERS TO GET CAUCASIAN GUYS - YOU SERIOUSLY will look like a WHORE to them and WILL get treated like one . Hey what u see is what u get , right?  Please dress more respectably  is all I advise .  You get more respect that way.<br><br>Get over it ...move on. If you cannot get a good job in singapore , look elsewhere instead of moaning about your low paying jobs or thereof lack of career advancement . That is what australians/americans/europeans do mostly , they get bored in their countries ,  they apply for overseas jobs which open up another area of the world for them to explore . Not to mention they will have a new area of expertise to compete with you back home. Can you actually believe my singaporean working experience came in useful in australia? It open some new avenues for me when I thought it was useless but my caucasian friend said use it and I did .  Make urself mobile , don't tie urself down .<br><br>Most of all quit moaning about caucasians or people dating them . It's a globalized world . Think of what can you make your future out of urself rather than blame someone else for your inadequacies . It doesn't project well on Singaporeans when someone does the anti caucasian thing.<br><br>PS the ones I find always complaining about the quintessential ang moh are actually the ones I find always kissing the ang mo arses . Come on . If they did wrong , tell it to their face. I do that and  I do have some problems with my colleagues regarding that but hell , they know I am very blunt and straightforward which they respect . How the hell would I even be a senior staff then?</div>

You are a vain man who is more worried about what others think of you than how much you care about each other. You are also a sexist by implying that all "females" must dress well.<br><br>2. Caucasian men actually don't mind a girl that dresses casually or comfortably, because caucasian men prefer relaxed settings to snob-parties.<br><br>3. Caucasian men, if they see a very well-dressed, made-up woman in a bar, think "high-class hooker" rather than "well dressed asian woman". A woman that dresses casually and comfortably is seen as being more "herself" than a poser in a suit.<br><br>Sad to say, but people like you give asian men a bad name and reinforce the pro-caucasian mentality.</div>

Some want trophy conquests , some want a relationship.<br><br>There are decent guys , regardless whether they are caucasian or singaporean ,who are out there. One example I know who is a decent singaporean and married to my ex uni classmate , he is a damn good husband who pampers his wife like no one's business. They remind me of my parents alot - very loving couple .  There is this decent bloke of a  caucasian guy I know who cuts off contact with every single girl once he is attached in a serious relationship   . He recently resumed contact with me when his relationship broke down ( after 2 bloody  years - I get a sudden hello from him) .</div>

Too strong a word ....what's wrong with tshirt and jeans? Maybe you should read a lil closer  ...I didn't recommend tshirt and jeans for formal events or work .  T shirt can mean loose baggy tshirts to well fitted tshirts to fashionable looking printed tshirts to work environment type tshirts ...jeans doesn't have to mean those misshapen jeans ...it can be bootcut , slim cut , capri like , hipster jeans, branded jeans.  Oh ya now is cold season so everyone wears a jacket , windbreaker over themselves ...haha<br><br>Actually there is a whole section of mens wear in davidjones here - 2 floors worth  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> .  Maybe you should come to melbourne.<br><br>So in your opinion ,  a girl to go out for a simple coffee and chat all dressed up to the nines , even to a hawker center or market?  People here in australia will laugh at ya if you do that.<br><br>As my dear caucasian friend said ....you don't dress up to the nines unless you want to hook up with someone <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> .</div>
