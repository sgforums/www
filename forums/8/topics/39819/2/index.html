Many evidence about the bible can also be faked. Especially when power and big money are involved. How can one fake the DNA evidence in the mitochondria? This evidence can be duplicated. In science, whatever proof  produced must be able to be duplicated by another scientists using the same methodology. This is what seperate science from religion. Religion is merely a hypothesis waiting to be proven. Not that I am a free thinker but I have my doubts with some teachings.</div>
