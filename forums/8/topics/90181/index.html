            <div class='col-md body'>encountered the following incident while i was shopping at a furniture shop at Funan Mall recently. i wanted to buy a desk but was aware that i might need to change my item after ordering, so i called days in advance to ask about their exchange policy. their staff told me that i would be welcomed to make an exchange any time as long as i have not received the goods. so i ordered the item on a saturday night and specifically requested it to be delivered after 6pm the next tuesday. they promised me that delivery would be made between 6pm to 8pm. after placing my order, i realised that the item was not appropriate and that i needed an exchange. i planned to do so before 5.30pm, which, based on what their staff have told me earlier, was completely okay. to my shock, i found that their delivery man around one whole hour earlier, without any notice to me at all. nobody should have been at home at that time, but by some bad coincidence, my mum happened to be around, and since she was unaware of the situation, she accepted the goods when they told her that it has been ordered and paid for. i only learnt about the early delivery after the men had left, at around 5.20pm. when i called for an explanation, they simply told me that the men could come "earlier or later" as and when they please and that the arranged time was only a guideline. i asked them what is the point of promising me a time if you cannot honour your promise. i told them that this completely disrupted my plans for an exchange and they curtly told me that i should have informed them 10-12 hours beforehand. i explained that this was not what their staff had told me when i called to ask earlier, and to my surprise, they just said that their staff could not provide complete information since "most people don't change their minds so quickly" and that it was my fault for misunderstanding them. this sounds totally absurd and foolish to me, cos it is almost like saying that we should just leave Sars patients to die since most people do not have Sars. they insisted that "most customers know" that exchanges should be made much earlier and stubbornly refused to listen to my explanation that different companies have different policies, which was why i took the trouble to call and ask specifically, only to be misled by their ignorant staff. the customer service manager was rude and unhelpful and was completely unwilling to listen to what i had to say. he seemed bent on butting in what i am talking and insisting that it was MY fault for not having known how they operate inside. i wonder how i would have known what they did in their company if they themselves did not know and could not provide me with full and accurate information. he rudely snapped that "nothing could be done since delivery has been made".<br>but i thought maybe i was too angry to think clearly and see the whole picture. can you guys give me some ideas on what you think?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i can understand how u feel but dun flame the delivery guys. Nowadays, to keep costs down delivery trucks go to many locations in a single trip, no company will give u a definate time say 5.30pm and be there on the dot! Most likely they will indicate a time frame say between 2 hours.(very good liao some companies give 4 hours time frames, u cannot wait then dun buy attitude) Put yourself in the person delivering the goods, they allocate 30 minutes per stop, along the way, any 1 address fly him aeroplane, the rest will be delayed. If he doesnt wait, the owner comes back and call company say he never come, lose lose situation.<br><br>I feel u were partly to blame for leaving things till the last minute. Partly sway also.<br><br>But economy now so bad, i would have tot that the company will ascede to your request out of good will. You could go to Case to resolve your problem lor. In future dun give them your business lor.<br><br>They Made a Sale but lost the customer.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i know that i was in the wrong to put things to the last minute. but seriously, i did not really have a choice.<br><br>i place on order on a sat night at 10pm and i decided to change my mind on sun night. but mon and tue, i had a totally packed day where i literally din have time for lunch even, so i really could not have done it earlier.<br><br>plus they start business later than i start work and they knock off at 5.30 before i knock off. so i really could not find the time.<br><br>perhaps it was my fault that i was hasty in ordering the goods, but the item that i originally ordered was almost $200 and the item i wanted to change to was $99 cash and carry.<br><br>i knew that deposits could not be gotten back, so i was fully prepared to lose that $100.<br><br>and since it was cash and carry, if they had told me that i had to dismantle the original thing, take it back myself, and carry back the new item, i would have gladly done so.<br><br>and they would have made an extra $100 out of thin air.<br><br>am i really totally at fault in this? especially when they did tell me that i could change "as long as before delivery" and they delivered 1 hour earlier than scheduled.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stonecarvings:</div><div class="quote_body"> encountered the following incident while i was shopping at a furniture shop at Funan Mall recently. i wanted to buy a desk but was aware that i might need to change my item after ordering, so i called days in advance to ask about their exchange policy. their staff told me that i would be welcomed to make an exchange any time as long as i have not received the goods. so i ordered the item on a saturday night and specifically requested it to be delivered after 6pm the next tuesday. they promised me that delivery would be made between 6pm to 8pm. after placing my order, i realised that the item was not appropriate and that i needed an exchange. i planned to do so before 5.30pm, which, based on what their staff have told me earlier, was completely okay. to my shock, i found that their delivery man around one whole hour earlier, without any notice to me at all. nobody should have been at home at that time, but by some bad coincidence, my mum happened to be around, and since she was unaware of the situation, she accepted the goods when they told her that it has been ordered and paid for. i only learnt about the early delivery after the men had left, at around 5.20pm. when i called for an explanation, they simply told me that the men could come "earlier or later" as and when they please and that the arranged time was only a guideline. i asked them what is the point of promising me a time if you cannot honour your promise. i told them that this completely disrupted my plans for an exchange and they curtly told me that i should have informed them 10-12 hours beforehand. i explained that this was not what their staff had told me when i called to ask earlier, and to my surprise, they just said that their staff could not provide complete information since "most people don't change their minds so quickly" and that it was my fault for misunderstanding them. this sounds totally absurd and foolish to me, cos it is almost like saying that we should just leave Sars patients to die since most people do not have Sars. they insisted that "most customers know" that exchanges should be made much earlier and stubbornly refused to listen to my explanation that different companies have different policies, which was why i took the trouble to call and ask specifically, only to be misled by their ignorant staff. the customer service manager was rude and unhelpful and was completely unwilling to listen to what i had to say. he seemed bent on butting in what i am talking and insisting that it was MY fault for not having known how they operate inside. i wonder how i would have known what they did in their company if they themselves did not know and could not provide me with full and accurate information. he rudely snapped that "nothing could be done since delivery has been made".<br>but i thought maybe i was too angry to think clearly and see the whole picture. can you guys give me some ideas on what you think?<br><br></div></blockquote>Hey.. you might want to call them again.. tell them you can pay for the deliver charges and change the desired table you want.. I think its more fair to both parties  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
