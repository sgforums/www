            <div class='col-md body'>Recently i have two cousins who were quarrreling about their pets at home. Lets named them person B and C. B was the one who bought the pet last year after great opposition from my aunt and family. Before getting the pet, B promised to pay for the pet's food, grooming, medical fees [if needed]... etc. C on the other hand promised to help out with the cleaning, feeding and to help with half of the cost.<br><br>But after awhile, C decided not to take up this responsibility anymore and only helped to feed the animal as he realised that it was not his duty to do so much, afterall it was B who bought the animal. In fact as time passes, feeding the animal seems like his responsibility and duty instead of B's.<br><br>The cage also stank as a result of not changing the cage. Even though the pet belongs to B, B rarely lifted a finger to change the cage and always left it to my aunt to do the cleaning. B only brought the pet to the vet once for grooming and till today the nails of the pet is long and it has difficulty in walking as the floors are slippery and the paws can't get a firm grip. After repeated calls by family members to B to bring the pet for its long overdue grooming B still refused. And every week, nagging by my aunt to B to change the pet cage became routine. Not only this has happened once, it has<br>happened before, when B brought hamsters home few years back. Every few days then would the hamster be fed and watered. And only after repeated calls then would the hamster cage be changed.<br><br>I got sick and tired of all these and decided to ask your comments on this. Is it considered cruelty to animals? Who do you think is at fault? B or C  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it is cruel.  The animal would still be in better condition in the pet shop<br>How come people nowadays have so much $$$ to buy pets all the time?<br><br>The auntie should get creative and come out with some penality for B to learn the consequence of his irreponsibility. Such as have the cage animal put in his room and such and from hence forth, if any pets are bought will go to B's room and stink up the his room.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>both at fault...atfirst the B chouldn't have bought the pet since he/she couldn't take care of it well...and C also shouldn't promise to help out in the first place...they are just being irresponsible for the pets...my advice is to ask them to give the pets away to someone who really can take good care of it~~</div>
