Why should rubbish workers or anyone have to suffer such awful smells?

There's just a lot of miscommunication, which is not uncommon.<br><br>The fact is, everyone is seeing only (false) ideas of everyone else, and not their actual being. So when you're upset and you attack someone online, you're only attacking your idea of that person online (ie. what he represents to you), and not actually that person himself.<br><br>And by Clarification, Law of Reflection and self-responsibility, when you say, "pple should not misunderstand me or throw personal attacks at me", what you're really saying (what the experience is teaching you), is that "I should not misunderstand others or throw personal attacks at others", as well as "I should not misunderstand me or throw personal attacks at me".<br><br>So anyways, even if there has been miscommunication or misunderstanding, but in the end it's all ok. Since you realize that we are really only seeing ourselves in others, in everyone that we interact with (this is the inner reflective meaning of relationships, with the outer being Evolutionary Duo, in support of each other's evolution); ultimately what matters is yourself, how you see all these aspects in yourself, do you accept and love them in yourself, and how you may continue to improve and evolve these aspects within yourself.<br><br>And then, you can share this with others around you as well.<br><br>Have a nice day <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually if there's a toilet nearby I will just dump my unfinished drinks into the sink before throwing the cup/can away. If not, just empty it onto the grass patch or sth lor.. Some ppl say it will attract ants, but let's put it this way - grass patches are not free from ants either even if u dun dump your drinks there. Unless you are saying it will breed more ants?<br><br>At the end of the day, best solution is to finish the bloody drink la...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yupz KangZ... you're right... the bottomline is: FINISH YOUR DRINK! If you decide to buy a can of drink, make sure u can finish it.... or else buy a bottled one where u can put the cap back on and bring the leftover home.... for those who have the habit of bringing along unfinished drinks from kopitiams, fastfood places, coffee cafes etc, make sure u finish them... if not, leave them there and dont bring them along with u!</div>

So does that mean that I can be labelled as an intelligent human being now?</div></blockquote>No problem, Freakass.<br><br>You see what I was saying about misunderstanding? The fact is, I *never* labelled (or even implied) that you or 'Andy Lau' were non-intelligent human beings (which you misunderstood me to do so).<br><br>What I was saying about the 'intelligence' bit is this. Some started criticizing and attacking in a non-productive way, such as, "what if pple slip on ice cube? or what if the sweet drink cause ant problem?", instead of offering productive solutions to the problems they speak of.<br><br>So I'm saying, use your intelligence (because everyone here is intelligent!) to *work out a solution* to the problem you mention, instead of unproductively just criticizing, "nope, your suggestion got problem. this got problem. that got problem", which is honestly not helping the situation. In fact, my concern is that pple who read their post, may get the wrong idea, and continue to throw drinks into rubbish bin.<br><br>So remember, I *never* do personal attacks. My "do u understand now? if not forget it", is not mean to say "u are not intelligent", it is merely an expression of my frustration at being misunderstood again and again. And my "if not, forget it" isn't signifying "i give up coz u can't understand", but my intention was, "i don't want to start a flame war on internet forum, so i'm gonna leave it alone", which is basically what 'andy lau' did, which I appreciated.<br><br>I don't like flame wars nor personal attacks, which is why I try not to start any such things. But misunderstandings are commonplace, so it's nobody's fault here (it's not productive to put blame on anyone), let's all just work together for a better tomorrow.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Touching on to what Ultima has quoted on the issue of unfinished drinks can and containers that are disposed in the bins, how about unfinished food containers? Isn't food having higher decomposition rate than beverage?<br><br>Often me see people dispose their food, either with dripping sauces and not consumed completely into the bins, which pose the same problematic issues as beverages? The worst of all is that food invites even bigger pests, birds to swamp in to pick on the food and littering the floor with more debris.<br><br>No doubt that there will be people who are unhappy that things turn out, but we have to understand that it's all human nature and upbringings. If you ask me whether would me do the same, frankly speaking, me would also like throwing unfinished drinks and food into bins, but most of the times that me had to do such a way is due to constraints and rush of events. At least fundamentally we have people disposing the items into bins and not anywhere else, at this moment of time, there will always be a minority group to do things differently.</div>
