But please, remember not to do it again. And just as importantly, please tell your friends, classmates and others around you (spread the message whenever you see someone about to throw a drink or ice into a bin), let them understand the consequences of such an inconsiderate act. I'm sure once they realize, they also wouldn't want to cause suffering to others deliberately.<br><br>Then where to throw the drink, liquid or ice? If outside, pour it down a drain, or even on the nearby grass patch. For ice cubes, you can even throw in on the road (it'll dissolve and evaporate rapidly under singapore heat). None of this is littering, because as long as you do in intelligently (eg. unfinished sweet drinks don't pour it on concrete floors, or inconvenience others in any way), you're helping to water the plants and cool the environment. And doing your bit to make the already unpleasant and thankless tasks of the rubbish cleaners, at least a little less unpleasant or painful.<br><br>Same for toilets and hawker centres. Pls be considerate for the toilet cleaners and hawker cleaners. Don't make a mess of the urinals, cubicles and basins. (I even remember seeing shit on a man's urinal before!). For hawker centres, pls don't spit, spill or dump food material onto the table, and if you're using tissue paper and your food is soup based, pls do NOT throw ur tissue paper into ur unfinished soup.<br><br>As long as you care, common sense is enough to advise you what is considerate behaviour and what is not. Please remember to let others know about this. Again, I believe it's not that Singaporeans are really evil, it's just ignorance.
