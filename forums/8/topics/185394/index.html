            <div class='col-md body'>It it saddening how many Singaporeans are insensitive and inconsiderate, even if they do not deliberately mean harm, but lack of concern and caring can also cause unnecessary difficulty to others.<br><br>Throwing half-finished drinks, liquids or ice into dustbins, is an inconsiderate act because the water makes a horrid mess of the rubbish. Decomposers (ie. bacteria and fungi) reply on enzymes to carry out their decomposition work, which in turn needs water to work. (This is why drying food can preserve it).<br><br>When pple throw drinks, liquids, ice, or even wet stuff that is not properly tied up in plastic bags, they are causing a lot of unnecessary unpleasantness to the rubbish cleaners (who are already doing Singaporeans a very huge service performing cleaning tasks that most pple won't be willing to do, without getting any thanks or appreciation, or even a decent pay for their service), as well as those poor elderly auntie/uncle who rumage through rubbish bins every day to find some tin cans to sell to buy their next meal.<br><br>If you have thrown drinks into rubbish bins in the past, it's ok if you didn't realize that it causes others this problem. But please, remember not to do it again. And just as importantly, please tell your friends, classmates and others around you (spread the message whenever you see someone about to throw a drink or ice into a bin), let them understand the consequences of such an inconsiderate act. I'm sure once they realize, they also wouldn't want to cause suffering to others deliberately.<br><br>Then where to throw the drink, liquid or ice? If outside, pour it down a drain, or even on the nearby grass patch. For ice cubes, you can even throw in on the road (it'll dissolve and evaporate rapidly under singapore heat). None of this is littering, because as long as you do in intelligently (eg. unfinished sweet drinks don't pour it on concrete floors, or inconvenience others in any way), you're helping to water the plants and cool the environment. And doing your bit to make the already unpleasant and thankless tasks of the rubbish cleaners, at least a little less unpleasant or painful.<br><br>Same for toilets and hawker centres. Pls be considerate for the toilet cleaners and hawker cleaners. Don't make a mess of the urinals, cubicles and basins. (I even remember seeing shit on a man's urinal before!). For hawker centres, pls don't spit, spill or dump food material onto the table, and if you're using tissue paper and your food is soup based, pls do NOT throw ur tissue paper into ur unfinished soup.<br><br>As long as you care, common sense is enough to advise you what is considerate behaviour and what is not. Please remember to let others know about this. Again, I believe it's not that Singaporeans are really evil, it's just ignorance. So this is where you can help them, let them know, help them to understand.<br><br>Thank you for being a nice person, wishing you a nice day.<br><br>Bedok Ah Beng<br></div>

So use your intelligence, and dispose of your drinks, liquids and ice in some appropriate way (eg. go to nearest toilet to throw away remainder drink, if got no other place to throw, I've done this myself many times!), that won't cause more problems to others.<br><br>A little bit of inconvenience, but it's doing ur part to help others. If u see difficulties with any of the suggested solutions, then come up with your own better solution. Two wrongs don't make a right. Instead of complaining abt problems, seek the solution. This is self-responsibility.<br><br>As long as you got the consideration in your heart, your love will light the way of your destiny. </blockquote></div>
