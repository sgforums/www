            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Is Contact Under Way in India? </strong></span><br><br>Persistent stories out of India indicate that something extraordinary is happening there involving UFOs. An Indian engineer working on antigravity propulsion has described studying advanced technology in "package" form--technologies ready made to be analyzed and duplicated. But where are they from?<br><br>Since October 10, everyone from members of the Indian Military to young children have reported seeing multiple UFOs of all shapes and sizes near the high altitude glaciers in the Tarai region of India, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the Chinese border. Indian Air Force pilots in the region have complained of unexplained instrument jamming and spotting the objects in the air during flight. Even a Buddhist monk, apparently not surprised by the activity, claims that the UFOs have been in the area since 1998.<br><br>Sumit Chatterjee reports that despite the militaryâ€™s usual tight lipped response on account of national security, some officials have responded bluntly and confirmed the presence of UFOs in the area. Indian ufologists suspect that the flurry of activity is related to the local rumor that beings from Sirius will land in the area within the next seven years, though not reveal themselves until 2012.<br><br>The Indian-Chinese border has recently been overcome with military activity, though it is unclear whether it is related to the increase in sightings. Chinese tanks were reportedly sent to investigate an artificial lake that had mysteriously appeared and threatened to flood the Indian Sutlej river valley. Upon reaching the area, however, they found that the lake had mysteriously disappeared. Chatterjee suggests that the extraterrestrials melted a glacier to form the lake in order to keep the Chinese tanks from reaching the border.<br><br>A UFO Roundup correspondent in India, Krishnari Bai Dharapurnanda, reports that according to the Indian Space Research Organization the extraterrestrials are constructing a fortress in the Himalayas for an unknown purpose and wished to keep Chinese tanks from the border.<br><br>Offering another explanation of the increased military and UFO presence in the Tarai region, Chinese UFO Roundup correspondent Chen Jilin reported a rumor that Extraterrestrials are in cooperation with the Chinese Communist Party and New Delhi to fend off an attack from Americans or Israelis.<br><br><a href="http://www.cosmicparadigm.com/ufonews/2004_11_07_archive.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cosmicparadigm.com/ufonews/2004_11_07_archive.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mountain villagers in the Tarai region of India's Himachal Pradesh state claim that UFOs have been seen "by day and by night" near the high-altitude glaciers of the Himalayas and that "aliens are building a very large underground base up there."<br><br>Since Sunday, October 10, 2004, UFOs, ranging in size from "very large cylindrical objects of a dull silver colour" to "small speedy discs," have been seen over the glaciers north of Chini, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) from India's border with China. UFOs seen at night were said to "glow red and gold."<br><br>"More Indian military personnel and local natives are coming forward in the Himalayas' Tarai area and are reporting many exceedingly abnormal activities and UFO sightings all around the clock."<br><br>"Some (Indian) helicopter pilots are complaining about sophisticated jamming."<br><br>"A young boy in Nepal drew a picture of what appears to be an extraterrestrial flying object. He saw it while playing with many friends on the ground. The boys reported that these vehicles have no sound, can take off vertically, and can float in defiance of gravity. These vehicles can disappear all of a sudden," reported Sumit Chatterjee.<br><br>"Some of the IAF (Indian Air Force--J.T.) pilots are continually reporting seeing strange flying objects in the Himalayas near the Chinese border."<br><br>"A Tibetan (Buddhist) monk who recently visited India said these activities have been going on since 1998."<br><br>"According to a scientist of the Indian Geological Survey, UFOs and strange beings are visiting a 100-square- kilometer portion of the Tarai. Visits have occurred frequently during the past 18 months. The northeastern region of Himachal Pradesh has experienced many varied sightings."<br><br>Chatterjee added, "Among the local people is a rumour that 'they' will land here in the next seven years. Some Indian ufologists say that beings from Sirius will land on Earth and publicly reveal themselves in 2012."<br><br>"Is this the final prophecy of the landing that the Mayans predicted centuries ago?"<br><br>"The military personnel are talking privately but maintain that for national security reasons nothing more can be said. But at least one of the officers has come out and said bluntly that these are UFOs."<br><br>"There are many indications that a large underground base is now being built within the hard andesite (bedrock) of the high Himalayas. The construction is going on in the high terrain close to the No Man's Land between India and China."<br><br>"Another interesting thing--increased Indian and Chinese army activity has been seen in the region."<br><br>But the strangest report comes from the Chinese side of the border. A Chinese armored brigade, outfitted with T-80 main battle tanks, was ordered to proceed to the border from the People's Liberation Army (PLA) base in Niuke. But when the tanks got to Zhada, they got a real surprise.<br><br>"Recently an artificial lake was created in China" west of Zhada, "very close to the Indian border. "The lake" filled the Langchui River (called the Sutlej River on the Indian side--J.T.) valley and "threatened to flood the Indian side. India and China both refused to investigate the incident. Then, all of a sudden, the local Chinese people reported that the lake was no longer there. Whatever remained of the lake was no longer a threat to the Indian villagers. What really happened?" Chatterjee asked, "What caused an artificial lake of this size? And who took care of removing the problem?"<br><br>"It appears that the aliens melted a glacier and created the temporary lake to prevent those Chinese tanks from reaching the border," said Krishnari Bai Dharapurnanda, a UFO Roundup correspondent in India. "There are many rumours at the Indian Space Research Organisaton (ISRO). They say these UFOs are definitely planning and building a fortress in the Himalayas for a purpose known only to the aliens themselves."<br><br>In China, UFO Roundup correspondent Chen Jilin reported, "No news is coming out of the Langchui Valley. It is a military region with very tight security. But the rumour is, the Extraterrestrials are active in the region with the collusion of the (Chinese Communist) Party and New Delhi, to ward off an attack from the Anglo-Americans and the Israelis."<br><br>Many thanks to Sumit Chatterjee, Krishnari Bai Dharapurnanda and Chen Jilin for this news story.<br><br>UFO Roundup<br><br><a href="http://ufocasebook.com/himalayanbase.html" rel="nofollow">http://ufocasebook.com/himalayanbase.html</a></div>

India is cooperating with Europeans and the Americans in space explorations and technology research program. India is also part of World Trade Organization. India is receiving major outsourcing contracts in IT and call-center service work from America and Europe. Indiaâ€™s Forex reserve is at a level never imagined before because of international direct investments from Western nations, Japan, Korea and others. Interestingly, China the arc rival of India changed its posture in the last few years to make Indiaâ€™s friendship and trade a priority. India is slowly getting to the point when it is accepted as a permanent member of the Security Council. All the five Security Council members China, America, Russia, France and UK support Indiaâ€™s inclusion.<br><br>When all these factors are added together and analyzed, it seems like India is being told by the world to abide by the hidden protocols and in exchange be recognized as a major emerging superpower</strong></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why do u think of all countries they want to contact India. Why not the US? I can tell u something about India's history is shrouded in deep mystery. They (indians) could be aliens themselves if u read that books called Mahabaratha and Ramayana, They have many theories and ideas there which sound like ET technology and their god has one of them , a blue skinned person called Krishna who could be an Alien. Why that of all people only this guy is blue skin?  He had great powers and manipulated others around him like Kings and warriors  to change events in the course of History &gt;He looks like this:<br><br><img src="http://amminadab.com/temple/images/krishna.jpg"></div>
