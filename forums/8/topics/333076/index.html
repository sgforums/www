              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;">A Better Understanding !!<br> <br> <br> Once upon a time, in a village, a man appeared and announced to the <br> villagers that he would buy monkeys for $10 each.<br> <br> The villagers, seeing that there were many monkeys around, went out to <br> the forest and started catching them. The man bought thousands at $10 <br> and, as supply started to diminish, the villagers stopped their effort. <br> He further announced that he would now buy at $20 for a monkey.<br> <br> This renewed the efforts of the villagers and they started catching <br> monkeys again. Soon the supply diminished even further and people <br> started going back to their farms. The offer increased to $25 each, and <br> the supply of monkeys became so small that it was an effort to even find <br> a monkey, let alone catch it!<br> <br> The man now announced that he would buy monkeys at $50! However, since <br> he had to go to the city on some business, his assistant would now buy <br> on behalf of him.<br> <br> In the absence of the man, the assistant told the villagers. "Look at <br> all these monkeys in the big cage that the man has collected.<br> I will sell them to you at $35, and when the man returns from the <br> city, you can sell them to him for $50 each."<br> <br> <br> <br> The villagers rounded up <br> all their savings and bought all the monkeys.<br> <br> They never saw the man nor his assistant again, only monkeys everywhere!<br> <br> <br> Now you have a better understanding of how Wall Street works.</span></p>

              <p>that is...not...how it works</p>
              <p>lol</p>
              <p>there is no giant con here. What more accurately happens is...</p>
              <p>man comes to village and buys monkeys for 10 dollars apiece. Supply dwindles and he offers 20. Supply dwindles even more. Some smart villager realises he can make money by buying monkeys from the next village at 5 dollars, pay 10 dollars for transport, and make the remaining 5 dollars.</p>
              <p>more and more people decide to do this, and trade is established between villages. man stops buying monkeys one day(totally legal!), but the trade continues, built on the speculation that the man will one day come back to buy more monkeys. prices escalate as people corner the market to consolidate bargaining power when the man returns. He never does. Meanwhile, farms are set up to breed monkeys. People order monkeys weeks in advance, anticipating prices soaring. The futures market is born.</p>
              <p>2 years later, the big monkey players can no longer afford to buy up all the monkeys, and starts selling them. Prices drop, and they are forced to sell even more before they lose monkey value. Prices drop even more. Suddenly monkeys are worthless once more. Worse, tons of honest monkey breeders are now stuck with monkeys ordered months ago, with many pregnant monkeys still about to give birth. Buyers who ordered them now refuse, or cannot pay up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Replace "monkeys" with "tulips" and you'll get the first ever market crash. Yes, an entire empire was once bankcrupted because people speculated in tulips. You heard right. Tulips. It's not a giant con. It's just stupidity mixed with greed.</p>
              <p>now replace "monkeys" with whatever tradable commodity/equity you want, and this describes wall street. Yeah, we never learn from our mistakes.</p>
