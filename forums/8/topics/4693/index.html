            <div class='col-md body'>Finally....we have reach the mouth-watering clash between England and Brazil.<br>England with its boring,workmanship-like football style will slap off challenge by the sambal chilli eating players of Brazil.personally...there is serious doubt of Brazil's defending ability n England will no doubt punish them severely with Heskey n Owen.But i hope that will all happen in the normal time cos if it goes to extra time or penalty,anything can happen.Brazil is not the same BRAaaaaZil we know of in the past.<br>even though i think brazil will be facing a near exit,i'm still in love with the way Brazil plays...esp Ronaldo's close control n careessing of the ball.wonderful balance n powerful shot to boot given his tall height.<br><br>btw,are u ppl staying at home or going out with friends to watch the match? maybe can intro some places to watch besides coffee shops and hmv.i heard can watch it on the big screen beside planet hollywood.can anyone confirm?<br><br>------------------<br><blockquote>Let us not look back in anger or forward in fear but around in awareness.<br>-James Thurber</blockquote></div>
