            <div class='col-md body'>I agree it's the male's ego problem and the female's security problem that shapes everyone's choice of partner especially in singapore. Tradition idea still linger about influencing people's preference eventhough it is weakening in this modern era.<br><br>Not only height is a problem but i think capabilities in the form of career, education level, finance, social status etc are also problems when choosing life-time partner. In general, my personal opinion is most female prefer male to be stronger compared to themselve in many way to make them feel secure and male prefer weaker female to boost their ego.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My personal opinion is that if you cannot even get past the height obstacle, then this person is really not the one for you. Even when you get together, what is to guarantee the height issue will not crop up again next time? Loving a person means loving that person. Period. Whether he is short, tall, fat, thin, kind, evil, it doesn't matter. Loving a person means you must accept everything about him/her. I am 1.76m, my gf is 1.54m, and our height difference has never been an issue since the day we met. I definitely did not love her any lesser because she is so much shorter, and I certainly would not love her more if she is 1.70m. fyi, my previous gf is 1.48m  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.</div>

For example, at first sight you look at him, hmm he is shorter than me, thus in your mind you will rule out him as a potential bf. But of course when you got to know him better, you may think he really suits you and starts to fall in love with him. Then the height problem is no longer a problem .<br><br>------------------<br>Devilish is my name</div>
