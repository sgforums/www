              <p><br>Are you a risk manager?!?!?! Haha.</p>
              <p>Back to the topic. I work in an accounting firm in London (not as an auditor though), but still, I may be able to provide some advice.</p>
              <p>I believe most of you by saying "accountant" are in fact referring to an auditor. In a nutshell, an auditor seeks to provide assurance over the truth and fairness of financial statements. Therefore, you will spend heck alot of time ticking boxes and doing various tests to gain confidence over the accuracy of company accounts.</p>
              <p>My friends in Asia say hours are crazy. Frequently past midnight. But the hours will improve as you move up the ranks. That's just the nature of the beast so you have to endure it to reap the rewards in the future.</p>
              <p>Speaking of rewards, there are significant benefits to training as an auditor, especially if you are able to leverage your time in an accounting firm into a professional qualification such as the ACCA, CIMA and what not. The pay jump is significant if you qualify and it increases your marketability (the training increases your business knowledge alot!).</p>
              <p>Also, if you were to make partner, the remuneration is ridiculous though not even close to top bankers.</p>
              <p>For those of you seriously considering a career in an accounting firm, don't just limit yourself to being an auditor. There are many functions in an accounting firm (go to their websites and take a look) which will appeal to different people. But all in all, join an accounting firm to get a professional qualification, not because of immediate remuneration. The benefits will only accrue in the long-term.</p>
              <p>Any other questions, please let me know.</p>

              <p><br>For experienced hires(associates and above), it depends on what role within IB's you're referring to. Taking lateral transitions into account, it's almost impossible for someone from accountancy to move into trading although the relevant accountancy experience would ease the transition into investment banking (M&amp;A, DCM, ECM, etc). Then again, with the right networks and appropriate contacts, nothing is impossible just that the probability of such transitions still tend to be skewed somewhat.</p>
              <p>At the analyst level, with the exclusion of certain roles that specifically require certain qualifications (ie.masters or PhD in financial maths/engineering for folks working on pricing/structuring), I don't think the specific major matters too much, although graduates of a quantitative discipline - usually accountancy, business, economics, engineering, actuarial science/maths/statistics - are still somewhat favoured (if my observations of the fresh hires I work with are anything to go by), which would be understandable given the highly numeric nature of the business, especially in FO roles.</p>

              <p>To all those thinking about an accounting career, I have very simple advice. Don't worry too much about what you are doing now. Whether its business administration or accountancy or what not, the most important thing to get out of it are communication, analytical and writing skills, amongst others. These transferable skills will follow you through life and you will derive the most benefits from them. Technical skills can be picked up along the way as you are more sure of your career path.</p>
              <p>Having a technical degree is beneficial only at the beginning as you will learn alot along the way. At least that's the way it is in London, alot of my colleagues have absolutely no finance, mathematical, accounting backgrounds. Does not stop them from working in an accounting firm.</p>
              <p>Of course, this is not really relevant if you are looking for a highly specialised job. As <em>walesa</em> mentioned, there is probably no way anyone with a non-mathematical background is going to get a job as a quant analyst or derivatives trader. But if anyone is looking to work in an accounting firm, don't fret. Any degree or diploma is fair game for recruiters.</p>

              <p>If you graduate from NTU, you will be a qualified CPA after 2 years of relevant work experience, same with ACCA. NTU B.Acc is equivalent to ACCA, but ACCA is ranked higher than NTU's B.Acc.</p>

              <p><br>CPA and ACCA almost the same in Singapore.</p>
              <p>If you graduate from NTU, you will be a qualified CPA after 2 years of relevant work experience, same with ACCA. NTU B.Acc is equivalent to ACCA, but ACCA is ranked higher than NTU's B.Acc.</p>

              <p><br>It's subjective. I have seen PRC doing alright for the lower and mid level papers, but when in the professional level, they can't make it. Reason, they memorised all the essay questions, I don't know how they do it, but they take out all the past year questions and memorise every damn word. But questions in the professional level is different, that's why some of the PRCs can't make it after the mid level papers. If you are already in accounting, then no choice, do ACCA or go NTU. Unless you want to consider a career switch.</p>
