If not you would be better stop thinking of her, saves you from getting more hurts. If she keep quiet and don't dare to say a thing could mean she likes you but confused over something that's bothering her.<br><br>however, sometimes girls get impressed with such manly courage and might like you suddenly. and this only applies to those homly girl or guai guai one.
