            <div class='col-md body'>i really wonder what JOY you get from rearing DOGGY only to make them ill and end their life prematurely.<br><br>9 years ago my sis bought a Pekingese from a pet shop out of impulse. My bro and i advised against her buying from a pet shop but she thought that the looks was too irresistable.<br><br>Turn out the dog had a congenital liver defect and it wasn't a problem the pet shop dunno. Because the 2nd night after bringing her home, she suffered fits and frothed in her mouth. And this will happen every few days.<br><br>So it was something that the pet shop should know.<br><br>For four years, we resisted all calls by vet to euthanised her. We believe she should live life to the fullest. But after 4  years, she left us for a better place, died when we went out.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Skibi<br><br><strong>Responsible home breeders</strong> do not jus breed for $$.  They take very good care of the pups and do not anyhow sell to Tom, Dick or Harry. They will normally screen thru buyers and make sure they can give the new pup a good life.  And good home breeders will make sure their dogs are free from any disease or sickness so that it will not pass down to the pups.  They will be able to share with buyers on the dogs parentage and history.  They will also provide after sale service coz they care for the pups, they will help new owners when there is a problem.<br><br><strong>Pet shops</strong> are very commercial.  Most pet shops do not really care much abt the pups they sell.  They only wan $$$.. they also would not share much abt the pup's parentage and history so you will not get an idea of the pup's family line.  As they have so many pups to take care of, they normally would not be so attentive to all of them and therefore issues like virus will happen, due to negligence..<br><br>In S'pore, it is not easy to find good home breeders tat's y ppl usually end up buying from pet shops (also coz of varieties).  I have frens who will buy from overseas reputable breeders but sad thing is u cannot see the pups in person unless u fly over there to choose and bring home.<br><br>Hope the info is useful to u.<br><br>This is based on my knowledge.  Should any members have any comments to add on or correct me if I'm wrong, please go ahead and enlighten.<br><br>Thanks!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>enerestan has mostly explain all.<br><br>just wanna add, breeders really watch what they are breeding. they do not breed any she-dog with a he-dog of the same breed. They will do research onto whether breeding the dog will produce any undesired genetic disorders. It is impossible to eliminate hereditary disorders especially if they are inherent in the breed. But they will minimise the chances of it happening.<br><br>More importantly, they are more concerned in keeping the species bloodline as pure as possible without passing down genetic disorders. They rather not earn your money than selling you something that could potentially ruin the bloodline of the breed in future.<br><br>As far as I know there are breeders in singapore located at Seletar Farms or Pasir Ris Farms. But your choice of breed are very limited and in my opinion, they are not the perfect breeders as the choice of Sire/Dames available in Singapore are limited and not many owners are willing to let their dogs breed.<br><br>Breeders will NEVER sell you a dog when they think the dog is not ready to leave its parents.<br><br>Petshops in Singapore get their dogs mostly from Australia or New Zealand because Singapore laws make it cheap to do so (no quarantine required for Aus and NZ dogs).<br><br>As far as I know there are breeders there who themselves are commercialised because it makes more economic sense to do so. Shame on them.<br><br>So the best way i guess for you to get a dog is actually do your reserach first on the breed. Then go to the breeder and share your views. From there make your judgement if the breeder really knows what he/she is doing.<br><br>If you really love dogs and have a deep passion in knowing what's the best, i believe you should take the trouble.<br><br>I hate it when friends around me suddenly wants a dog, and go to the pet shop to get one. Only to cage them almost 24 hours a day and uncage them if they want to play with it. And be stingy when the dog is sick and not want to bring to a vet.<br><br>sigh....too many ignorant ppl around.<br></div>
