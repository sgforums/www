              <p>If he still have not returned you that part of that thing.</p>

              <p>Thats argu-able as spreading malicious gossip aka defamation.</p>
              <p>He can request for you to take down the details.</p>
              <p>But he cannot claim defamation.  Not yet.</p>

              <p>And insist that he return you what he promised to.  Or at least let him work out a compromise to return the whatever he promised to you in kind.</p>

              <p><br>Just wait for the letter.</p>
              <p>And receive that so called lawyer letter or court letter, then you get a lawyer to advise you.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, no point worrying yourself to it.</p>
              <p>Do not offer to private settlement with whatever money you think you or others advise you to give.  Not without at least going thru the lawyer or take the advise from the courts.</p>

              <p>I am not in favour of seeing anyone being bullied, espacially young adults.</p>
              <p>1. You have the right to seek redress for what happened to you, espacially if you can back up your claims.</p>
              <p>2. Posting photos and information relating to your problems are only evidences to substantiate the claims you are making in public view.</p>
              <p>3. The other person too have a right to defend himself, and if he wants, he can seek legal counsel for advice or proceed to sue you in a court of law. This right does not AUTOMATICALLY means he will win in a case.</p>
              <p>4. Furthermore, defamation cases are long drawn and costly, up to thousands of dollars. Therefore, if you put up photos and information and presume you are right, then challenge him in face off in court, for he is in the wrong, he may even have to pay for every cent of your legal cost.</p>
              <p>5. NEVER be afraid of a lawyer letter. That piece of paper is meant only to frighten you, in the hope that you will be stupid enough to back off, apologise, because most people are not aware of their rights and want no trouble, espacially if what they seek is small compared to the court action that may loom.</p>
              <p>At most, they can only tell you to remove the post as a first stage. It would have already serve its purpose anyway, so taking it off is no shame, and continue to ignore other threats, by engaging in a lawyer to brief you on your rights and your options next.</p>
              <p>There are free legal counsel you can turn to, offered by community serving lawyers.</p>
              <p>6. Should the other party proceeds with legal action, have no fear, stand your ground as long as you think you are right, and battle it out. The other party will have more to lose.  No one goes to jail in civil suits or have anything attached to their personal records. You may even put fear back into the other party to back out and reach for a private settlement with you.</p>
              <p>7. At this current stage, you SHOULD NOT settle for private settlement and be bullied or even blackmailed for more inducement for the other party to stop legal action. Keep track of all correspondences he sends to you, avoid all meetings and engage a lawyer to represent you. Tell him to talk to your lawyer.</p>
              <p>But if you are a student, and don't want anymore trouble, and had removed the pics and info, then there is nothing more to fear. You had done your job to blacklist him and made others beware of him. Walk away. Chances are you are unlikely to get the property you seek from him anymore. A lesson learnt in excercising trade.</p>
              <p>If he wants trouble, either you report to the police or send him a legal letter instead. Nothing to fear, buds, so long as you know your rights. Next time, be smarter and leave no trace. Conpersons must not be tolerated or be allowed to misuse justice to serve their despicable ends by frightening others.</p>
