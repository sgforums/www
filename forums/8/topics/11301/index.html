But as a whole, I would agree that they are doing an excellent job.

            <div class='col-md body'>i too agree that our govt has been doing a great job with this little country of ours...lky and gct are 2 great ppl together with their team of ministers, have brought about prosperity to everyone BUT not enough is being done...<br>one big problem that the govt is facing now is that there are not enough poiliticians out there or rather not enough joining PAP...<br>this you have to blame the govt... with restriction on freedom of thought and speech, many youths nowadays can' be bothered to go into politics since it could result into them ending up in jail under the ISA<br>those that probably had interest are probably deterred by the ISA...<br>one big problem i feel the govt or rather the PAP has is that it fears that if other ppl take over power they wouldn't be able to do a good job and s'pore would be in turmoil<br>hence they come up with all type of measures to suppress opposition...but thats doing more harm than good.. it results in the above mentioned problem..<br>so what happens when lky dies or gct retires... lee hsien loong and team would face a huge problem of rebulding and reshaping the govt cause not many capable ppl will step out... think abt this...capability may come in the form of opposition...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well bear what u said is correct however, to add on to peiyi's point, peiyi has a point an i think i've got a solution...i feel that the change in ministers should be held regularly...for example America's presidential system is that they vote for the president once every 4 yrs, i think the prime minister's seat be put up for election once every 4 yrs that way all those wanting to make a difference can get a chance and even if they turn out to be horrible leaders, four yrs is not too long to do much damage (unless he/she does a hitler[than he/she should be impeached]) and the P.M should be given the chance to be re-elected for multiple terms if he/she is deemed capable(by the citizens of course)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is no doubt that the Singapore government (PAP) had been very successful during its rule for the last 35 yrs. But the thing is that although we are called a republic, it seems that we do not really have much demoracry.<br><br>Well, just take a look at Potong Pasir. It has been under the rule of Chiam See Tong for quite a number of years. Despite the fact that its buildings are old, PAP doesn't want to uprade it at all. Just because it is under an opposition party rule. Well, in the last election, David Gan didn't lose very badly and it means there are actually people in the area that supports PAP. Even for those people who supports the opposition party, they also had contributed to the success of the nation and why do they have to be "punished" for having more confidences in the opposition party? I guess PAP had acted a little to mean in this issue.<br><br>Talk about the salary of the ministers. Come on, as one of the post mentioned, we don't bribe poeple so that they won't be bribed. The government explains the rationale behind this as "So that ministers do not fall into corruption". I think the down side of this is that in the end, we may attract people who aren't really concerned about politics and the nation. Instead they are actaully more concerned about the pay they would be getting. If that happens, whats the difference between having a corrupted government and bo chap governemnt??<br><br>The sincerity of the government is sometimes also doubted by the public. Look at the Speakers' Corner. Speakers are not allowed to bring in amplifiers and tentages for their speech. Let me ask you, would you want to stand in the hot sun or cold rain to listen to people talking? i doubt so. If the government really wants to let the public have a place to voice their opinion on issue, why not provide a condusive place for them?<br><br>I am not anti-PAP, it is just that sometimes whatever they act and speak seems irrationale to me.<br><br>------------------<br>Where is Montgomery?
