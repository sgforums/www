Do you think construction worker can get a PR status? the whole building of my office is swam with foreigner PR.<br><br>And do you think a baby bonus will work on singaporean?? maybe it will work on you. but not on majority of the singaporean when they think it is so hard to raise a kid in singapore with everything so expensive. So high the price of a flat to accomodate a family etc. the government is as good as doing nothing in this sense.<br><br>It's analog to the situation when you see a drowning man, yes you tried to help but all you did is stand there shouting for pple to help when you yourself know how to swim and din help. The government i do not think is not capable or poor. They could had put in more incentive if they really care. They could help to lower the burden of raising the next generation of singapore making it different if you are the true citizen of singapore instead of confering almost the same benefit to both foreigner and its citizen.</div></blockquote>Well,the baby bonus in my opinions is not enough,but at least it's an acknowledgement of concern about our falling birthrate and it's a measure taken,albeit inadequate 1.But then i think Singapore is not a good place to bring up kids,agree?ehehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Theory Of Relativity<br>Eating a lot of good food will make 1 hour seem like 5 minutes while eating lotsa horrigible cooked veggies will make 5 minutes seem like 1 hour <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">~~~<br>Waiting for Diablo 2 Add-on <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To moose:<br>Do you think you can afford a HDB flat with no HDB loan or debt incurred in singapore with your pay to start a family? do you think you can support your family of 3 kids with you working alone in SAF and your wife staying at home teaching your kid well?<br><br>I believe by then you will be complaining like hell why life in singapore as a singaporean is so hertic when the foreigner can just come here to work and get rich back home. Maybe by then you want to complain, however are you allowed to voice your complaint to effect changes? No! you have to go along with every policy of the government. You have no say. You are just a moose tied with a thread running on the wheel to drive the economy so that our government can be rich. you are not allowed to voice your opinion. Don't you think you are just a slave legalised by law.</div>

I was born in 1979 and my parents got fined $600 for giving birth to me as I was their third child .That time I heard from my parents the TV got this ad showing a apple being cut into 2 and 2 kids got one share each and the third couldn't have a share. That is so cute (It was the 2 child policy then) Then a few years later the PAP realise that Singapore population is facing aging problem and started to give bonuses and rebate to the parents for having a third child.
