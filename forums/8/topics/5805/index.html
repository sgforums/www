            <div class='col-md body'>The will to power sounds much like the struggle of the animal kingdom. Only the strong shall survive. It's a one-for-himself/herself world.

            <div class='col-md body'>MayaJade,<br><br>Morality for peace Â– which group of people benefit most from this Â‘peaceÂ’? All kind of social, economic or political system distinguishes two basic sets of people Â– the exploiters and the exploited. Think of any mode of production and you will see a class engaged in production and a class that owns the means of this production.<br><br>Religious morality Â– How does the religious and political subjugation of peoples by the Holy Crusades and Spanish Inquisition promote peace? Peace for the exploiters who wield a stable of morals for justification for hegemony. Nietzsche puts it that morality or any given system of acceptable behaviour benefits the strong. (In a nutshell) As such, by adhering to this morality people subjugate themselves to this class. On the other hand Christian morality is a weapon wielded by the weak against the strong since they do not possess the means of production (IÂ’m splicing Marxism with Nietzscheanism here) by elevating themselves on a higher moral plane, i.e. platitudes like Â“The meek shall inherit the earthÂ’, Â“Turn the other cheekÂ’, Â‘Love thy neighbourÂ’ etc. According to Nietzsche these are ideological excuses and explanations the weak give themselves for non-competition with or subjugation to the strong. And because this inaction is so seductive, it creates a herd mentality.<br><br>The questions are,<br>Are contemporary morals beneficial to YOU, or for another type of people?<br>Can you recognise certain types of morals or social rules that benefit another class instead of YOURSELF? If you can, do you dare to break them?<br>What is GOOD and what is EVIL? Why have they been given the values they have?<br>Are notions like Â‘peaceÂ’ and stabilityÂ’ catchphrases for the subjugation of the masses?<br><br>Â“And he who has to be creator in good and evil, truly, has first to be a destroyer and break values.Â”<br>Nietzsche<br><br>cheers<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dammit, pewter acted cute so I had to write this again  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>The peace I referred to was basically the peace knowing that most people around have enough morality for these:<br>1.  Not killing me to eat my meat or to skin me.<br>2.  Enough of them think that it's not good to snatch away my new swanky handphone or other belongings<br>3.  Not disturbing me<br>Yeah many of them may not be doing it for morality but for fear of the law but basically I believe that morality and law safeguard me from attacks.<br><br>Aside from that, I am not concerned about any other types of morality.  To me the values regarding sexuality  are mostly rubbish, except rape, and I do not feel any oppression from others' moral standard.  I ignore them and the most they can do is to ostracize you or whatever... at least when you're in Singapore, not in places like Indonesia.  I'm sure I would have been stoned to death for multitude of moral lapses if I'm still living there.<br><br>Actually, which part of morality are you discontent of?  Why bother?  If superman is as super as he is ought to be, I thought he wouldn't be able to care less about others' moral values, he'd just ignore them and do things his own way.<br><br>I think I should read Nietsche's book(?) because I'm curious about his full picture of the Superman.  And while at it, have you read The Lord of The Flies?  Do you suppose it's possible that uncoached children might be canibalistic and savage because morality needs generations to learn?  I believe that human have great ability to think but I don't think we are flawless in our thoughts.  We are not infinitely wise we can figure everything out ourselves.  Even if our deeds satisfy us what about others?  Doesn't the superman give a hoot to anything at all?  Family? Friends? The fellow countrymen?  The near-to-extinction animals?  The trees?  Whatever?<br><br>I think the minimal order is necessary for me to live without worrying for so many things I might go crazy<br><br>Maya</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Everything exists because of some reason, even if the reason is not valid anymore.  I think morality, by making life more predictable, was meant to create peace.  Certainly it is not peaceful to have people stepping on you all the time.  That morality can be used to step on people all the time is a gross mistake because it was actually meant for good purposes.<br><br>Also, I think the existence of so many Ubermensches is not sustainable.  One of the thories on why the dinosaurs perished is that the carnivores grew too fast compared to the herbivores and in the end they died starving.<br><br></div>
