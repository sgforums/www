He would bring some during their regular monthly meetings (either at IBM or OFS). Should you want these at other times, please contact him at eawtan@yahoo.com and they can try to arrange pickup (He stays in Tampines). As they are still unaware of the demand during the meetings, he typically brings only ~2 sets of each. If you are sure you will turn up and want the CDs, he can always reserve and burn extra sets, just give him &gt;2 days advance notice.<br><br>Note: For Debian (netinst version), you can contact Eugene at eugeneteo@lugs.org.sg. Useful for those who wants to do a network install, and use sid right away. If you can't wait to get it, you can arrange to meet him in NUS. Thanks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Is Linux use at risk?</strong><br>By Eileen Yu<br><br>A law suit involving Santa Cruz Operation Group (SCO) and IBM could halt future deployment of open source software, Linux.<br><br>But the Linux User Group of Singapore (Lugs) said users evaluating or using Linux need not be too concerned over this on-going suit.<br><br>SCO has alleged that IBM had wrongfully duplicated several codes of Unix software and embedded them into Linux. SCO owns rights to Unix and has its own Unix-based operating system, UnixWare. It is suing IBM for damages worth at least US$3 billion (S$5.26 billion).<br><br>Also, SCO reportedly sent letters to about 1,500 of the world's largest corporations, warning them that they could be liable for using Linux.<br><br>In a letter to SCO's partners, Mr Darl McBride, the firm's president and chief executive officer, wrote that it has 'compelling evidence' that Linux contains unauthorised SCO Unix intellectual property.<br><br>He added that SCO has suspended its sale of Linux, but would 'continue to support our SCO Linux and OpenLinux customers and partners who have previously implemented those products'.<br><br>'We will hold them harmless from any SCO intellectual property issues regarding Linux.'<br><br>But he did not say how this would impact such users under the General Public Licence (GPL), which governs the distri-bution of Linux.<br><br>Said Mr Tan Min Liang, a technology lawyer with a major law firm here: 'The GPL permits anyone to read, modify and distribute such a program's source code, on the condition that the source and any of the accompanying modifications are made readily available to the public.<br><br>'The SCO-IBM legal tussle raises certain pertinent issues with regard to the GPL, especially since SCO had previously distributed Linux under the GPL.'<br><br>He added that the culmination of the SCO-IBM suit and other issues, such as the laissez-faire code contribution model adopted by the open source community, will fundamentally alter the model as it is known today.<br><br>Systems integrator Metaparadigm helps organisations such as Overseas Family School manage open source architectures.<br><br>Mr Michael Clark, the firm's managing director and an avid open source supporter, is still 'very comfortable and quite happy' to continue promoting the use of Linux to his clients because the risk of doing so is 'minimal' and 'very, very small'.<br><br>He said: 'The only risk of end users being litigated would be if SCO can prove ownership of copyrighted material, and take on a Napster-style battle that targets end users.<br><br>'This would require SCO to point out what the copyrighted material is, and even then, the Linux community would respond immediately by removing the disputed code.'<br><br>In an e-mail to Computer Times, Mr Lim Swee Tat and Mr Sanjeev Gupta from Lugs, said SCO is unlikely to pursue the case to end users, even if it wins the case. They are the Lugs' president and vice-trea-surer, respectively.<br><br>The firm's allegations against IBM have been shown to have no merits, they added.<br><br>One such instance is SCO's claim that it owned the remote copy update (RCU) technology, which relieves memory bottlenecks on multiprocessor servers, that IBM had inserted into the Linux 2.5 kernel series.<br><br>The two Lugs repre-sentatives said that it is unclear why SCO thinks it has the rights to RCU since the technology was originally developed by Sequent in the early 1990s. Sequent was acquired by IBM in 1999.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>FSF Statement on SCO v. IBM<br>Eben Moglen<br>June 25, 2003<br><br>The lawsuit brought by the Santa Cruz Operation (SCO) against IBM has generated many requests for comment by FSF. The Foundation has refrained from making official comments on the litigation because only the plaintiff's allegations have been reported; comment on unverified allegations would ordinarily be premature. More disturbing than the lawsuit itself, however, have been public statements by representatives of SCO, which have irresponsibly suggested doubts about the legitimacy of free software overall. These statements require response.<br><br>SCO's lawsuit asserts that IBM has breached contractual obligations between the two companies, and also that IBM has incorporated trade secret information concerning the design of the UNIX operating system into what SCO calls generally ``Linux.'' This latter claim has recently been expanded in extra-judicial statements by SCO employees and officers to include suggestions that ``Linux'' includes material copied from UNIX in violation of SCO's copyrights. An allegation to this effect was contained in letters apparently sent by SCO to 1500 of the world's largest companies warning against use of free software on grounds of possible infringement liability.<br><br>It is crucial to clarify certain confusions that SCO's spokesmen have shown no disposition to dispel. In the first place, SCO has used ``Linux'' to mean ``all free software,'' or ``all free software constituting a UNIX-like operating system.'' This confusion, which the Free Software Foundation warned against in the past, is here shown to have the misleading consequences the Foundation has often predicted. ``Linux'' is the name of the kernel most often used in free software systems. But the operating system as a whole contains many other components, some of them products of the Foundation's GNU Project, others written elsewhere and published under free software licenses; the totality is GNU, the free operating system on which we have been working since 1984. Approximately half GNU's components are copyrighted works of the Free Software Foundation, including the C-compiler GCC, the GDB debugger, the C library Glibc, the bash shell, among other essential parts. The combination of GNU and the Linux kernel produces the GNU/Linux system, which is widely used on a variety of hardware and which taken as a whole duplicates the functions once only performed by the UNIX operating system.<br><br>SCO's confusing use of names makes the basis of its claims unclear: has SCO alleged that trade secrets of UNIX's originator, AT&amp;T--of which SCO is by intermediate transactions the successor in interest--have been incorporated by IBM in the kernel, Linux, or in parts of GNU? If the former, there is no justification for the broad statements urging the Fortune 1500 to be cautious about using free software, or GNU programs generally. If, on the other hand, SCO claims that GNU contains any UNIX trade secret or copyrighted material, the claim is almost surely false. Contributors to the GNU Project promise to follow the Free Software Foundation's rules for the project, which specify--among other things--that contributors must not enter into non-disclosure agreements for technical information relevant to their work on GNU programs, and that they must not consult or make any use of source code from non-free programs, including specifically UNIX. The Foundation has no basis to believe that GNU contains any material about which SCO or anyone else could assert valid trade secret or copyright claims. Contributors could have made misrepresentations of fact in their copyright assignment statements, but failing willful misrepresentation by a contributor, which has never happened so far as the Foundation is aware, there is no significant likelihood that our supervision of the freedom of our free software has failed. The Foundation notes that despite the alarmist statements SCO's employees have made, the Foundation has not been sued, nor has SCO, despite our requests, identified any work whose copyright the Foundation holds-including all of IBM's modifications to the kernel for use with IBM's S/390 mainframe computers, assigned to the Foundation by IBM--that SCO asserts infringes its rights in any way.<br><br>Moreover, there are straightforward legal reasons why SCO's assertions concerning claims against the kernel or other free software are likely to fail. As to its trade secret claims, which are the only claims actually made in the lawsuit against IBM, there remains the simple fact that SCO has for years distributed copies of the kernel, Linux, as part of GNU/Linux free software systems. Those systems were distributed by SCO in full compliance with GPL, and therefore included complete source code. So SCO itself has continuously published, as part of its regular business, the material which it claims includes its trade secrets. There is simply no legal basis on which SCO can claim trade secret liability in others for material it widely and commercially published itself under a license that specifically permitted unrestricted copying and distribution.<br><br>The same fact stands as an irrevocable barrier to SCO's claim that ``Linux'' violates SCO's copyright on UNIX source code. Copyright, as the United States Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized, covers expressions, not ideas. Copyright on source code covers not how a program works, but only the specific language in which the functionality is expressed. A program written from scratch to express the function of an existing program in a new way does not infringe the original program's copyright. GNU and Linux duplicate some aspects of UNIX functionality, but are independent bodies, not copies of existing expressions. But even if SCO could show that some portions of its UNIX source code were copied into the kernel, the claim of copyright infringement would fail, because SCO has itself distributed the kernel under GPL. By doing so, SCO licensed everyone everywhere to copy, modify, and redistribute that code. SCO cannot now turn around and argue that it sold people code under GPL, guaranteeing their right to copy, modify and redistribute anything included, but that it somehow did not license the copying and redistribution of any copyrighted material of their own which that code contained.<br><br>In the face of these facts, SCO's public statements are at best misleading and irresponsible. SCO has profited handily from the work of free software contributors throughout the world. Its current public statement constitute a gross abuse of the principles of the free software community, by a participant who has employed all our work for its own economic benefit. The Free Software Foundation calls upon SCO to retract its ill-advised and irresponsible statements, and to proceed immediately to separate its commercial disagreements with IBM from its obligations and responsibilities to the free software community.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Asian Linux: Some keen, others cool</strong><br>By Winston Chai, CNETAsia<br>Thursday, July 24 2003 10:25 AM<br><br>Asia can leapfrog Western countries in the development of Linux-based applications but some governments are not latching on to this opportunity, says a senior IBM executive.<br><br>"The open-source movement is moving faster here than in the U.S.," said Michinori Nakahara, manager of Linux sales and marketing for IBM Asia-Pacific South.<br><br>In the region, he pointed to Japan, Korea, China and India as strongest proponents of the Linux operating system. "We've talked to authorities in countries like China and Korea and they are very interested in considering open-source," he said.<br><br>In particular, Nakahara sees great potential for research and development into embedded Linux applications in the region. Embedded Linux, which competes with embedded operating systems such as Microsoft Windows CE and Symbian, can be used to power electronics devices such as video recorders, mobile phones and network routers.<br><br>"In particular, India and China are doing a lot of development on Linux at the client end," he added.<br><br>Given the momentum in the region, Nakahara is surprised that Singapore, one of the most technology-savvy nations in Asia, has stayed coy on the open-source movement and decided to forgo the chance at gaining a technological lead.<br><br>"Singapore is an advanced country--a familiar location for many research institutes and one of the earliest adopters of the Internet. Yet, people here seem to very conservative towards Linux and I'm not sure why this so," he told CNETAsia.<br><br>Nakahara was speaking to reporters at the sidelines of the IBM Business Forum in Singapore.<br><br>While his observations aren't revelatory, they stand testament to how some countries seemed to have turned a blind eye to the open-source movement.<br><br>North Asian countries like China, Japan and Korea have long signaled their endorsement for Linux and even formed an alliance in March to fine tune Linux and develop related applications.<br><br>For countries with a strong manufacturing base such as China, Korea and Japan, Linux gives them a chance to create an operating system free of licensing fees and with full control over the source code. Also, for China and India, there is national pride in working with an operating system that has intellectual property not owned by an American company.<br><br>"Most interest in Linux has been in Australia, China, Japan and Korea and this momentum is coming from governments rather than enterprises," said Robin Simpson, Gartner Australia's research director, in a previous interview.<br><br>Japanese authorities recently said it is considering a switch to Linux during its next IT systems overhaul in 2005.<br><br>The government has reportedly taken to a 188 million yen (US$1.6 million) contract by Fujitsu, IBM Japan and Oki Electric Industry to use open-source systems for managing salary and other personnel administration data for the country's 800,000 public servants.<br><br>In 2001, China's Beijing municipal government too snubbed Microsoft and awarded six software contracts to Chinese vendors, including a deal for 2,000 desktop OS seats to Red Flag Linux, a state-linked Linux developer<br><br>In Singapore, a spokeswoman from the Infocomm-Development Authority (IDA) of Singapore, the country's tech industry regulator, has previously confirmed it is currently not looking into implementing Linux on a government-wide basis.<br><br>However, IDA said it has now included Linux as a server operating system option for government tenders and contracts, along with other alternatives such as Microsoft's Windows 2000, Sun's Solaris, IBM's AIX and Hewlett-Packard's (HP) Unix.<br><br>"Singapore seems more closely aligned with Microsoft and traditional commercial software development companies," said Gartner's Simpson.</div>
