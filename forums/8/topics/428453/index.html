              <p>For example, if you call NEA to come to your house to inspect for mosquitoes and after a long time the officers never come to inspect yet, some people will call up NEA to kao bei and scold the officers.</p>
              <p>Some people call the banks to request for a new card, new pin etc and after a long time still never receive they will call the bank to kao bei and scold the officers</p>
              <p>Some people want to apply work permit for maids to come to take care of their family and after a long period of time MOM still never approve they will call MOM to kao bei and scold the officers</p>
              <p>Have anybody ever call the police and kao bei and scold them before?</p>
              <p>Like if you make a police report of loanshark harrasement and after a long time the police still never catch them, do you dare to call the police to kao bei and scold them?</p>
              <p>Of if the police take your things like labtops etc for investigation and after a long time still haven't solve the case and never return back to you, do you dare to call the police and kao bei and scold them?</p>
              <p>Anybody tried calling the police and scold them before?</p>

              <p>STOMPer<strong> iceblue </strong>was disgusted that the family who had
                  caused a 5-hour standoff on board an SBS Transit bus was given a free
                  ride home in a taxi. He feels they should have received a stiff penalty
                  for their behaviour instead.<br><br>The family of four, comprising a
                  Chinese national couple from Beijing, an elderly lady and her daughter
                  (both Singaporean) as well as their maid were told by the bus captain
                  to alight after they had brought a wheelchair on board the bus. <br><br>This
                  was because the bus was not equipped with a padded wheelchair dock,
                  which meant that transporting a wheelchair would have been unsafe for
                  other commuters.<br><br>Here's what the STOMPer wrote in an email today (Jan 19):<br><br>"I
                  was surprised to read an article in Wanbao yesterday about this family,
                  including two members from China, who 'hijacked' a public bus for about
                  5 hours in Singapore, and was given a free taxi ride home by SBS
                  Transit.  <br><br>"The family had wanted to board a bus near Mandai
                  and was refused by the bus driver for bringing a wheelchair up on the
                  bus due to safety concerns, as wheelchairs are a safety hazard and
                  might injure others on the bus if there are no safety straps onboard.<br><br>"The family refused to alight and left other commuters stranded on the bus. <br><br>"The reason given by the PRC woman was that the bus did not have signs that forbid wheelchairs to be brought up.<br><br>"The bus captain had to call another bus in to transfer the other commuters to. <br><br>"I am amazed by SBS Transit's response in providing a free taxi ride home for the family to end the fiasco. <br><br>"The
                  situation seems to have been mishandled. It just suggests one should
                  make a fool out of yourself to have your requests granted. It sets a
                  bad precedent.<br><br>"Clearly, in this scenario, the family had not
                  only created a public nuisance, but also wasted taxpayer's money by
                  activating the police and increase costs for the public transport
                  operator. <br><br>"The police, should have taken action against the family instead.<br><br>"No wonder our public transport costs are increasing."</p>
