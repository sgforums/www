Students that are able to learn faster in a separate class then those that need more help. Maybe the education system here is tough, but how many countries can get such a high rate of students passing o levels? Would you rather we be uneducated?<br>We have no other natural resources besides our location and people. So have to concentrate on moulding the children as they are the nation's future.</div>

But you'll most probably end up in JAIL, getting FINED or having an 'interview with the policeman'...   :p</div></blockquote>Ha ha, not only that! There are so many WHINERS in Singapore. Whine about noise, whine about language, whine about dressing. You know what I mean. And what's the justification for this whining? We're an ASIAN society, so we are CONSERVATIVE. Fuck sia.<br><br>Singapore is like that lar, everything also cannot. Talk or joke loudly, and you'll see people writing in the newspaper forums about young people having no manners. Dye hair, body piercing, tatoos, costume jewellery...bad bad, society is degenerating. Sports like skateboarding, rollerblading, stunt biking, bad bad, damage public property, people who do these have no morals. I can go on and on about the tangibles, the list for intangibles will never end either. Oh well, so much for our CONSERVATIVE ASIAN society. Fuck it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thing I hate about Singapore:<br><br>1) The topical weather of stickyness - But it's alot better than the hot summer of Aussie....trust me. If SG have the climate is Aussie spring/autumn...then it's the best.<br><br>2) The Educational System - Many people have explained it. I'm even a victim. Poly grad who struggled his life. Applied many times for a course in NTU but was rejected cos priority is given to JC students AND FOREIGN STUDENTS. So how?....lan lan siao siao go to Aussie to get a degree and kena complain by the locals for stealing their chance to study....haha....it's a vicious circle. But I do applaude their choice of English as first language.<br><br>3) The lack of appreciation for arts. Didn't do enough to promote and cultivate our own arts and culture. Want to create a creative society? Dump the books and the "memorizing" method and start to cultivate creative thinking.....of course the GOV tried but parents complained.....duh!<br><br>4) Not real hate but.....The lack of freedom of speech(FOS)? In the 80's the GOV is very strict on these stuff. But I think the GOV are getting more and more lax on controlling our FOS over the past decade (that's why this forum still exist) and I believe they will continue to be more lax. But I still think that we will never have FULL-BLOWN FOS cos people tends to abuse it. In aussie, I've already seen many abuses and people shooting each other and being personal. If that kind of so-call FOS exist in SG, I think SG will have alot of social problems. Until we prove that we are responsible enough for our own speech...FOS will always be controlled.<br><br>5) Not hate but some say our politics sucks.....I agreed and disagree too. If you say our government sucks I can relate to that.....but politics sucks? If you've seen Aussie/US politics, you'll be even more disgusted. Of course I disgree with the governments policies sometimes but I think they a pretty good job. Some may argue that Singapore is small and easy to gover and the people are too tame.....but who cares? The fact is that they did a pretty good job.(for now) No...I'm not a PAP fan(I disagree with some of their stuff too).<br><br>What I like about singapore:<br><br>1) I overheard some HK students at my school saying "Those Sing Gah Por Reans ah, always eh speak with the 'lah' and'leh'......."<br><br>In Brissy, it's easy to spot a singaporean, by the way they talk (beside the 'lah' and 'leh'), the clothes they wear (giodano, levis....nike air), the deuter haversack they carry, the Q00 bottles they use for their water bottles, The brand of cigrattes they smoke (unfortunately, marlboro is very rare in Brissy). If you see a specky asian guy, most prob his a singaporean.<br><br>And some of you complain that we got no identity. I'm glad we Singaporeans have an identity although most will disagree.<br><br>2) Foreigners who came to SG don't can SG's transport system is world-class for nothing. If SG improve our cust-service, we are truely world-class liao.<br><br>3) The avaibility of services. You just need to take a lift down to buy food from the nearby mama shop or go to a nearby "Dr Tan" clinic or go to the coffeeshop to by.<br><br>4) CHEAP Food or all varieties..........I miss Laksa and chicken rice  :p</div>
