He's going to take a holiday and forget the whole thing.....I am very happy for his mother. She was very worried and she's old and not well."<br><br>The Attorney-General's Chambers had earlier called for a deterrent sentence.<br><br>It is not known if they would appeal against the judgement. - CNA<br><br>(WHO'S NEXT TO DISPLAY ROAD RAGE N NOT GET JAILED?!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> )</div>
