I know of another friend of mine who would only take roti canai for his breakfast and would flood all the fish curry on it, and drink the curry from the bowl... until I took him to a chinese restaurant, he gets addicted there and did not want to eat steak anymore...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>M1 Garand<span class="large"></span><br><br><strong><br><br>The M1 Garand (more formally the United States Rifle, Caliber .30, M1) was the first semi-automatic rifle to be put in active military service. It officially replaced the Springfield 1903 rifle as the standard service rifle in 1936, until officially replaced by the M14 that was developed from it in 1957. It would be heavily used in WWII, Korea, and to a limited extent in Vietnam. It was primarily used by the U.S., but also some other countries. It continues to be used as a civilian firearm, and by some drill teams.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/45/Garand.jpg"><br><br>Notable features<br><br>Weight was approximately 9 pounds 10 ounces (4.3 kg) unloaded but varied with wood density from rifle to rifle; length was 43.6 inches (1.1 m). The rifle is fed by an en-bloc clip which holds eight rounds. Loading was through the top of the receiver. After the last cartridge is fired, the rifle ejects the clip and locks the bolt to the rear. Clips can also be manually ejected at any time. Charging a partial clip in the rifle is not commonly done because it takes more time than ejecting the clip. The en-bloc clip is manually ejected by pulling the operating rod all the way to the rear, and then depressing the clip catch button.<br><br>Ejection of an empty clip created a distinctive "ping" sound. Some incidents during World War II were reported when Germans used the ping sound to alert them to an empty American rifle. During the Korean War, incidents were reported where American soldiers used this sound to their advantage noting that the enemy would pop their heads up when they heard the clip sound. A common misconception, stories about clip noise are mostly anectodal and it likely had little positive or negative effect on any engagement.<br><br>Originally chambered for the 0.276 in (7 mm) Pedersen cartridge using a 10 round clip, the Garand Rifle was later standardized to use the then-official U.S. military rifle round: "Ball Cartridge, 0.30 in (7.62 x 63 mm), Model of 1906," commonly known as the .30-06 (read "thirty-aught-six"). Its maximum effective range is listed at 440 m, with capability of inflicting a casualty with armor-piercing ammunition well beyond 800 m.</strong></div>
