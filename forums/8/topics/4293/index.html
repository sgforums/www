Maybe mine was worse than yours.  My ex bf cheated on me somemore, without considering the fact that I TOLERATED his family.  His mother even insulted my parents... why?  Because my siblings and I were capable enough to make money and pay for our own school fees in poly and in Uni, which her children are all useless freaks who only asked money from parents.  They are rich, so what?  Rich people don't know how to behave like rich people (classy I mean).<br><br>His mother even said,"All guys don't need to tidy up their rooms.  Their wives or gf must!  Otherwise, they will be considered badly brought up by parents."  "There is not such thing as sexual equality.  Women are always one level below men."  How come she never say this to her daughter or daughter's bf?  In fact, when my ex bf's sister quarrelled with her bf, she would bring him home to let her parents scold him.<br><br>So guys and gals, I'm not telling you to be kia su or what... But before you commit in a relationship, do check out the person's background and how his/her family is like, unless you are not serious about the r/s.<br><br>But Ruthbaby, I was luckier than you in some way, because his family did not harass me after we broke up.  You see,... THEY DARE NOT!.  The reason was very simple.  I am educated and know a few close friends who are lawyers or litigators.  Anything goes wrong, I won't hesitate to sue.  This family want face one.  So they won't want their horrible behaviour to be reported on newspapers.<br><br>------------------<br>Make money.  Make big money!</div>
