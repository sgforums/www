            <div class='col-md body'>I remember i read somewhere about the reason why sg use these gurkhas..cos lee kuan yew felt indebted to their country( not very sure why...i think some gurkha saved his life or smthg)...so as a way to 'help' them. Sg employs all these nepalese...its obvious dat coming here will allow them to get out of the poverty trap back home...so i think alot of them are keen to come here work.<br>The sec skool dat i studied in was right beside the nepalese contingent's estate (ie the gurkhas' family like kids, wife, parents etc)...their estate is fenced up...with a gurkha policeman holding mp5 guarding the entrance into the estate.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br>Then when our nepalese frens in sec skool invited us go to their house....we were like 'uhhhh...no thanks'...cos got a cop holidng gun...i dunno...at dat age we were kinda scared.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Anyway...last but not least...YES...THEY ARE F**KING FIT...they can run for hours on end without stopping....during our NAPFA 2.4km...the nepalese boys SPRINT...i think their 2.4km clock 8min plus .

            <div class='col-md body'>Gentlemen,<br><br>From my early years, I have been informed that the Gurkhas are tough, loyal and disciplined. They are paid the same as regular PO, given condo-like living place, good welfare, families sent over, children studies here and commanded by an Ang mo.<br><br>On the question on why commandered by an Ang mo ? I do not know. But at same time, this also make me questioned about their loyalty.<br><br>To many, they are killer- like tough looking soldiers in blue. Do not mess with them is the impression. Holding a SMG and Being a regimental organisation .. does help. They are always more well armed than our regular PO.<br><br>I have personally met quite afew of them, have spoken with them and have done duties with them. They are great chaps, friendly, loves girl talks and loves buying 4D and Toto, it seems. They are like regular people ... really.<br><br>And I must say.. year on year.. I do find that they have soften, not like those I have seen 15 years back. In those days, they are really those no nonsense type outfits. Not any more, presently I find them slacking in all aspect... except being fit and tough.<br><br>I will not depend on them on most situations. If they are sent to take a terrorist location.. I assume they will perform greatly... But I suspect the commandos and SOC will be sent instead. To hunt for villians, they are at the middle of the column, as I see in the Pulau Tekong where armed robbers were reported to have landed there from MY. To patrol the streets, they don't speak local and are no verse in the local Law. They seemed to be shielded.<br><br>To protect installation, seemed to be their only forte and duties. They are armed with MP5s, very very Garang. But how would they react to situations. That ! I would Question.. they have no war experience.. when was they last time you see them in action, and I mean real action, not just presence. Maybe their presence are what is required.. I don't know.<br><br>I know of afew incidents that much affected my opinions.. I will not disclose it though. But they great fellows and very on the ball... that I have my great respect.<br><br>Cheers<br></div>

I understand that they are on contracts and troops are constantly renewed, some have PRs. But you have to understand that comforts breeds lofts. They are not from extreme poverty and hardship state as before. With better life, families to feed and properties does make one think ... twice... especially who and why they are dying for. What the hell do they have at stake in Singapore that they should lay down their lifes for.  Talking about bravery, I believe some singaporean's will even die to protect when circumstances fall into their believes and national security. Heroism are often only seen in times of desperation.</div>

I understand that they are on contracts and troops are constantly renewed, some have PRs. But you have to understand that comforts breeds lofts. They are not from extreme poverty and hardship state as before. With better life, families to feed and properties does make one think ... twice... especially who and why they are dying for. What the hell do they have at stake in Singapore that they should lay down their lifes for.

They are paid the same as regular PO, given condo-like living place, good welfare, families sent over, children studies here and commanded by an Ang mo.<br><br>On the question on why commandered by an Ang mo ? I do not know. But at same time, this also make me questioned about their loyalty.<br><br>To many, they are killer- like tough looking soldiers in blue. Do not mess with them is the impression. Holding a SMG and Being a regimental organisation .. does help. They are always more well armed than our regular PO.<br><br>I have personally met quite afew of them, have spoken with them and have done duties with them. They are great chaps, friendly, loves girl talks and loves buying 4D and Toto, it seems. They are like regular people ... really.<br><br>And I must say.. year on year.. I do find that they have soften, not like those I have seen 15 years back. In those days, they are really those no nonsense type outfits. Not any more, presently I find them slacking in all aspect... except being fit and tough.<br><br>I will not depend on them on most situations. If they are sent to take a terrorist location.. I assume they will perform greatly... But I suspect the commandos and SOC will be sent instead. To hunt for villians, they are at the middle of the column, as I see in the Pulau Tekong where armed robbers were reported to have landed there from MY. To patrol the streets, they don't speak local and are no verse in the local Law. They seemed to be shielded.<br><br>To protect installation, seemed to be their only forte and duties. They are armed with MP5s, very very Garang. But how would they react to situations. That ! I would Question.. they have no war experience.. when was they last time you see them in action, and I mean real action, not just presence. Maybe their presence are what is required.. I don't know.<br><br>I know of afew incidents that much affected my opinions.. I will not disclose it though. But they great fellows and very on the ball... that I have my great respect.<br><br>Cheers<br></div></blockquote>Guess who storm the SQ117?<br></div>
