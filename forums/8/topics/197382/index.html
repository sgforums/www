The Football Association of Singapore (FAS), through the Young Lions management, also paid a portion of the two Nigerian-born Singapore citizens' personal income tax for the last financial year.<br>.<br>According to tax consultants Today spoke to, the personal income tax for each of the footballers for their $50,000 sign-on fee could be anywhere from $4,000 to $6,000 each, depending on the amount of relief both may have applied for.<br>.<br>The FAS' chief of administration, finance and corporate affairs Samuel Panthradil confirmed that the body had agreed to pay the personal taxes for the two men, but only for the $50,000 sign-on fee.<br>.<br>He said: "During the negotiations between the Young Lions management and the two players, it was agreed that the $50,000 which the two players received was nett. It was agreed that the tax attributable to the $50,000 payments would be borne by the FAS."<br>.<br>While the taxes paid by the FAS for the two players may not be a large amount, football officials and players Today spoke to yesterday were outraged. Several officials also felt disappointed that the FAS agreed to almost every demand the duo made.<br>.<br>Said a senior national player, who spoke on the condition of anonymity: "It is a matter of principle. Agu and Dickson are supposed to try and assimilate into Singapore's society.<br>.<br>"Yet, they are given special privileges such as having a portion of their income taxes paid. Some national players have served the country for years but we have never had our income taxes paid or even subsidised by the FAS.<br>.<br>"This is a joke."<br>.<br>An S-League club chairman added: "If they were foreign players who were new to Singapore football and their salaries were not that high, I would understand the need to offset some of their personal taxes.<br>.<br>"But Agu and Dickson were earning much more than most of the average footballers in Singapore at the time."<br>.<br>And while they were playing for the Young Lions, their accommodation was paid for in full by the FAS, the club chairman said.<br>.<br>The FAS still subsidises the accommodation costs for the two players Â— who now play for Woodlands Wellington Â— despite their having been axed from the national team.<br>.<br>Agu and Dickson have been in the news this year for all the wrong reasons.<br>.<br>At the beginning of the year, Agu pocketed US$20,000 ($32,544) from an Indonesian club before reneging on an agreement to play for them, while Dickson failed to report for national duty that same month.<br>.<br>In March this year, the FAS announced unprecedented punishment for Agu Â— the 21-year-old was fined $20,000 and banned from international football for a year.<br>.<br>This followed the punishment dished out to Dickson, who was banned from national duty for six months. The FAS, following a discussion in Parliament over the subject three months ago, said that they will review the Foreign Talent Scheme.</blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
