If he were far less extravagant, a larger portion of donations could go to the needy. No need for gold taps, expensive paper and a fleet of executive cars, unless they were gifts. I'd prefer to see the money spent on these go to the patients to seeing him get some traditional penalty.<br><br>However, demanding refunds of past donations is a tad too much.</div></blockquote>Donors do not have a legal right to demand back their donations as no Manifest disadvantage have been incurred.</div>
