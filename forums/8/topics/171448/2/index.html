            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Glen999:<br><strong>Dec 29, 2005 (ST)<br>[b]Durai has done far more good than bad for NKF</strong><br><br>ALMOST 20 years ago, I was a project manager with the National Kidney Foundation (NKF). At that time, it was a small outfit, with few staff. We squeezed into a modest house on the grounds of Kwong Wai Shiu Hospital in Balestier Road, which we shared with the NKF's sole dialysis centre.<br><br>Some administrative staff were fortunate to have desks. Project managers camped out in the sole meeting room in the building, sitting wherever we could. Mr T.T. Durai's office was a tiny space under the stairs. He held the position of honorary secretary.<br><br>The dialysis centre was a depressing place, with its cold, functional appearance. If I remember correctly, it could serve only about 30 patients then. Funds were extremely limited, so we could not help everyone who applied for help.<br><br>The first time we met to select new beneficiaries was heartbreaking. We hated to turn people away just because we did not have enough money, but we had no choice. Feeling helpless, we cried.<br><br>We worked long hours but we did not mind, even though we were not compensated and had very modest salaries. Mr Durai was an important motivating force. He had big dreams of a network of dialysis centres, with a bright and cheerful environment to help keep patients' spirits up.<br><br>He talked often about improving the lot of patients and their families, and developing programmes to encourage them to lead normal, productive lives. His face would light up with enthusiasm every time he talked about his dreams for the NKF, and he would beam with joy whenever we scored a win.<br><br>He worked tirelessly to make the NKF a better organisation, and even played a significant role in pushing through the opt-out scheme, which made more donor organs available for transplant.<br><br>Almost three years ago, I met Mr Durai again when I visited the new NKF premises. I was floored by how far it had come. How civilised and stylish! The NKF was truly a pacesetter and I was filled with pride at its accomplishments.<br><br>There is no doubt Mr Durai has made mistakes. He is human, after all, and which human being is perfect? He has passion, which can produce spectacular results but can also get him into trouble.<br><br>In Singapore, we have been encouraged for years to think out of the box. If not for Mr Durai thinking out of the box when we were all huddled together in the old office at Kwong Wai Shiu Hospital, the NKF could well be still an ineffectual beggar charity, like so many others out there. He has done far more good than bad for the NKF.<br><br>The man is a visionary, and every country needs visionaries. Had better checks and balances been in place at the NKF, this sorry state of affairs could have been avoided.<br><br>People make mistakes, or sometimes they just dare to take a different road, which may rankle with the masses. What is the use of baying for blood? Can we please try to forgive?<br><br>Carol Chua Siew Gek (Ms)[/b]</blockquote>ms Carol Chua,  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  u are real cute in yr "advise" at the end of 2005!!!</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Indeed Durai brought NKF to where it is now, including the unfortunate fund mismanagement incident.<br><br>The NKF pioneered (in SG) charity shows and aggressive soliciting of funds through road shows and telemarketing.<br><br>All of which (in my opinion) is wholely unethical. To use jackpot prizes and lucky draws that include brand new cars and plasma TVs to entice viewers to call in to 'donate' takes away the true meaning of charity and instead, turns it into a money spinning enterprise. This was a likely borrowed move from their many visits to Las Vegas performances.<br><br>Ultimately, <strong><span style="color: red;">greed</span></strong> superceded everything else rather than the welfare of the patients. Let's not forget that the patients, the ones who really needed the cash, saw a mere 10 cents per dollar. It's safe to say that probably 40 cents went to all the productions and road shows and 50 cents went into the volunteer / executives pockets.<br><br>Carol Chua Siew Gek will be wise not to over state her case in this matter.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I won't deny that Durai did a lot of good for a lot of people.<br><br>However, there's a Malay saying that goes 'a single drop of ink will contaminate a whole pot of milk'. In other words, a single mistake will completely taint all the good that you've done.<br><br>People make mistakes, and they should be forgiven for their mistakes if they realise the error of their deeds, apologise to the wrong parties, and make amends.<br><br>However, the way I see it, Durai doesn't seem to be doing any of the above. He doesn't seem to realise the error of his ways, making dumb excuses instead (which were all rejected by KPMG). He hasn't apologised to kidney patients for not acting in their best interests or to the general public for using their donated money wrongly. He hasn't made amends by compensating the people he had knowingly sued wrongly.<br><br>So tell me....  how is everyone supposed to forgive him?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Look at the present situation, the reputation and goodwill of NKF has been badly demoralised and many donors from the lifedrop programs have constantly withdrawing their donations, which mean their resources is depleting.<br><br>No doubt, Mr Durai deployed a excellent marketing strategy to NKF. If this is a private organisation, he will become the most successful CEO, on the other hand, look at how many non-profit organisation are trying to survive and fight a piece of the pie. The fittest ones are to survive and the weak ones are left to die - Darwin's theory. Hence, non-profit organisation got act like a profit organisation, to compete, to survive in the turbulent environment.<br><br>However, the grave and serous mistake Mr Durai inappropriately used the donors' funds, not for NKF but beneficial to himself. How can we forgive if that amount of funds could actually save lives of many kidney patients? Take an instance of the cars NKF has bought for Mr Durai, at least worth a few hundrds thousand. How many lives are ruined rather than NKF's main corporate strategy of saving people?<br></div>
