            <div class='col-md body'>Bad driving habits belong to both male and female drivers.  But sadly, I think there are more female BLUR DRIVERS than male. Conversely, there are more male RECKLESS DRIVERS than female.<br><br>Blur female drivers are guilty of stuff like... last minute change of lanes because they don't know where they're going or they can't decide where to turn; making sudden turns across junctions because of bad judgement of oncoming traffic; slow response to road condition or over zealous braking; road hogging due to over caution.<br><br>But everyone scolds everyone else while driving.

            <div class='col-md body'>That's really bad luck.  I don't think you should've failed.  By the way my car stalled during the test and I still passed.  Perhaps the tester had a limit to the number of passes he could give, so he gave you the axe.<br><br>Ever observe that some female drivers wait at a junction when there are no cars, but race across it when cars approach?
