            <div class='col-md body'>Be proud that you're a Chinese. But if you're saying that you feel low-class because you're listening to Chinese songs, then it's a different story. I'd say blame it on the Chinese music scene from Taiwan. They're churning out singers (WHO CAN"T SING) everyday. And most of the songs from Taiwanese singers are crap. It's very different from the days in the 80s or early 90s when Chinese/Canto music rules. I was an avid fan of Chinese/Canto music back then, but now I can't even bring myself to tune in to a Chinese radio station. It's agonising.</div>
