            <div class='col-md body'>It's normal to argue about this. I once accused my bf of that. Then he pointed out that I've been taking him for granted. He's very attentive with me- he holds my hand all the time, he carries everything, including my handbag, and he opens the car door for me. When nobody's looking, he sneaks a light kiss or a hug. And he has always been there when I was upset.<br><br>Could she be taking you for granted? We girls are sometimes guilty of that. Maybe a gentle reminder would help.<br><br>If not, be really attentive when you go out with her next time. Don't have to buy her expensive stuff. Hold her hand. Tell her she looks great when you meet up. Make an effort to listen, even if she's whining about something again. And surprise her occassionally with flowers, a gentle kiss on the cheeck, a small item she might find useful.... you get the drift. I like to smell my bf's hair and plant kisses on his forehead. He loves it. Would your gf like that too?<br><br>Hope that helps.<br><br>[This message has been edited by purr (edited 14 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To girls, every little thing that you do counts...whether you are giving her one stalk of flower, or a huge bouquet (unless maybe it's for special occasions), it means the same to her....it's not the quantity, but the thought that counts....so, just pay more attention to small details and i'm sure she will be able to appreciate you more...<br><br>also, when she's complaining things to you, listen to what she has to say, don't do other things and listen to her at the same time...it will make her feel as though u r not bothered by her problems...dun invalidate wat she says (for eg, when she say "I feel so stupid", u shouldn't invalidate wat she feels by saying "no, u're not stupid lah", it will make her feel as though it's wrong of her to feel that way...rather, say something like "dear, what's wrong..would u like to tell me about it??" then give her a hug after tat...) this way, she'll feel that you really care about her, and want to be there for her....<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by sparkle (edited 14 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I feel that although guys should take the effort to do all the 50 sweet things Rinoa has so kindly pasted on for our reference, there are times when I feel that as a guy, its a no-win situation.<br><br>I have been grilled at 3am in the morning by her about what make-up she uses. The position of things in her room etc.<br>Then there are times when she simply doesn't want to talk to me because I said 'something insensitive'. When I ask what it was, she says 'Don't pretend you don't know'.<br>Well, NEWSFLASH: I really dun know!!<br><br>Sometimes it gets really perplexing trying to second guess her. Sometimes it works, e.g.)taking some of her files she left at my place to the movies just in case she pulls out. She did call it off and then asks me: 'You wanted to bring notes to watch a movie with me?!?'<br>Which would have led to the 'insensitive' part if she wasn't feeling so sick I had to bring her back.<br><br>There have been other situations like the 'Which Dress should I wear, the Black or the Blue?' I have learnt NEVER to answer that question. Its a Red Herring. She has already chosen a dress. She wants you to be the same 'wavelength' as her and tell her the dress she chose.<br>Something like when Daniel was called to interpret the dream of the King who didn't tell him what the dream was. (Ref: see Bible, Book of Daniel)<br><br>Its at this point of time when, if you have picked the wrong dress, she says, 'we're so different' (sub-text: WHY are we even together in the first place?).<br><br>I dunno. But I love her all the same.<br>But sometimes I wish she was a tad bit more transparent in what she wants and what she thinks. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well thanks Rinoa. Yea i guess i do feel that i do feel she cannnot be satisfied sometimes. I do tell her how much she means to me...and very often too.

            <div class='col-md body'>Oops, if Rinoa says that those are signs of trouble, I'd better be on my toes more.<br>Racife my man, I think its time to clear things up with our respective Gfs.<br><br>Cluon is damn funny, hey, does the phrase 'Don't touch me!' sound familiar to you?<br><br>Rinoa: What happens if she refuses to let me touch her? I mean the simple things like holding her hands when we cross the road. Its not like she says it out loud, but she just pulls it away.<br>I know for sure that she's a committment phobic person, and sometimes I feel like I'm there to 'tide her over' till the next guy comes along. I know its very dangerous when we start speaking like polite friends and that's where we are right now. I feel tolerated.<br>The problem is I can't tell this to her and not risk another 'we're so different' response and another fight which basically leads to nowhere. The problem is that we're having quarrels about things that doesn't have a direct relation to our lives, eg) I don't wanna go out and meet a group of people  and she starts a diatribe about how antisocial I am. We're having a discussion about politics and she HAS to be on the opposing side of my views, probably just to show that she's very PC and different from the normal run of people.<br><br>Its frigging driving me nuts! Racife, I intend to live my life as a bachelor and have a dog as a companion and leave the girls to the rest of the guys in the world who have tricks up their sleeve to make them docile.<br><br>Me? I'm just an ordinary guy with simple tastes. Why is it guys always have to do the understanding bit? To tolerate her tantrums, to take care of her when she's sick and she turns around and say that its 'normal' Bf stuff. Why can't I do something more? Something romantic?<br><br>Dog. Studio Apartment. Single. Here I come. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Fey...<br>Oh well...she is commitment phobic and do you know why??You must find the root to all the problems...the "taking for granted" symdrome ie TFG is very common for most of the relationships. Either one party takes for granted and makes the other feel inadequate. I always believe communication is very important. Both of you should actually sit down and find out what is the menace of the whole entire displeasure of each other. Though it may lead to some unwanted arguements....at least u know what is the host and u can start finding the cure and antidote for it.<br><br>But the problem is when they know what is the problem , they wanna avoic the issue for fear of break-ups and as such. But this are phases of life..In life, there are so much to be explored and know.Love comes in all forms...ur frens family....your work...studies...and interests. I always believe true love prevails. If u are always feeling miserable while so called "in love"...what is the point of being in love then?Even after each argurment, there should be a conclusion and solution...and both of u should feel better and taking the realtionship to a higher peak cos u have reached a higher level of understanding.<br><br>Have u asked her if you see a future for both us??Always be very far-sighted and imaginative for the future..Both od u should share a vision .Not only living in the present but working towards the future...<br><br>Hope my advice works...no matter what I am still young.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">Seek multiple advices to reach the right one.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
