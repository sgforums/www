            <div class='col-md body'>Worm...<br>Well, since u ask..maybe U can try telling him how you feel. Some guys are a little tad more insensitive and might be a little MCP. U should sometimes tell him how u feel as I always say the communication in a relationship is of utmost importance. I dun believe in keeping mum and tolerate each other...I think a relationship stands out only if they understand each other feelings, -ve or +ve.<br>Instad of sulking why is he reacting so ungentlemanly..why dun you tell him how u feel.Maybe he is inexperienced on how to treat a girl nicely.Some guys needs training as well...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">But I feel that since you are still young, there are always better opportunities to meet better guys who will treat u like a gem. This only the first phase in your life..and there is still so much for u to explore.Hope this works!;P<br><br>P.S:But seriously if I were u , I would have dump him for saying that sentence "I dun want to try to be sensitive to anyone!" Hey, what is this...U are just not anyone..U are his GIRLFRIEND!! I will never allow a guy to shout at me like this like he is the king and i am just a chambermaid under his royal feet. He has no respect for u at all. Think about the whole realtionship again if he is the one for U.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 17 January 2000).]</div>

How can u possibly tolerate such an insensitive idiot?! Sorry if u found my comment insulting or whatever, but I honestly don't comprehend any of this. Find urself the better life u deserve, either being single or getting a better bf. Such guys (read:Morons) do not deserve gfs. Hope u ain't offended by my personal opinions.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't agree too much with the dump him part. Try to talk things over worm...sure dumping him may be the easiest and fastest way out, you can even say that there are plenty of other guys out there but can you say that you are 100% sure they will be better than this current guy?<br><br>jUSt mY ThoUGhtS...~!  :p</div>
