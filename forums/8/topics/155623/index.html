At the counter with this cashier who was talking non-stop with her colleague...<br><br>"Hahaha...." "Blah blah blah...." "Hahaha...." I looked at her and waited as the queue behind me built up...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>"Hahaha..." FINALLY. She took my purchase and scanned it. "Hahaha...." Nice to see a happy work force around..?<br><br>Then I paid and moved myself slightly aside so that the next person can come in while I try to keep my change...<br><br>"Hahaha..." She took my purchase again and scanned it..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  "Hahaha...." Asked the next person in queue for the sum to be paid... I quickly took back my purchase.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  What the hell..??

            <div class='col-md body'>There was another incident when I was shopping in TESCO hypermart where this lady handed out her sole credit card to pay off the amount of RM 666.22. She did not bring enough cash by the way, only RM 50 in her purse.<br><br>When the cashier scanned and found that the card was rejected, she acted surprised and asked the cashier to scan again. This process went on 8 times, and the queue started to build up longer and longer. She didn't even mind a bit and was making herself comfortable and pretending that her credit card was usable.<br><br>No one in the line said anything about her and she started to turn around and tell us, you have to wait ok, I am here first. Then she turn around to her friend and said, you know this kind of cashiers really dunno how to work, you must next time bring the exact change for them, if not they don have the correct change for you, that's why I use credit card nowadays. blablablabla... sounds like a typical dato's wife.<br><br>Then finally when the credit card machine rejected her card for the 8th time, the cashier told her that she had better call the bank to check up her card. She started scolding and blaming the cashier for his incompetence quite loud. Can say the end of the line also can hear it, there were about 15 ppl on the queue already. She called the bank and the bank informed her that she has now overused her money and the card is currently frozen temporarily. She became hysterical and shouted over the phone. My goodness, paiseh lor that fellow...<br><br>Finally she had to walk out bare-handed and a hung up papaya face. The cashier was quite pissed off, but there were some who started laughing at her.</div>
