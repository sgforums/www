However I should also emphasize that the term "complexity", which is casually thrown about by creationists to support irreducible complexity, is not well-defined and not easily quantifiable.<br><br>Take for example some species of grasshopper with 120,000 genes, 3-4 times more than the human. Are grasshoppers more "complex" than human beings?<br><br>As we learn more about embryo development, we see that one strategy for producing a multi-cellular organism is the use of modular gene batteries and the use of iterative repeats, so that a small amount of base genomic information can result in a large diversity of developmental functions.<br><br>Our mathematical colleagues would call this "fractals". For example a plant genome doesn't need to encode for all the exact positions of every leaf on the adult tree - the developmental program simply repeats the same function for every successive leaf formation.<br><br>That allows for simpler, less "complex" genomes.</div>
