My office is situated in central business district where talents like me are aplenty. Though reservist is very important for my family and I, it came to a point that I don't really have the time to serve it.<br><br>It was during one of those toilet breaks when I realised how wrong am I. Joe shiamnscosft has been in singapore for a good 10 years now and we had become good buddy over the years.<br><br>i remembered when i first started joe and i were on equal terms, both entry level junior executives. What frustrated me was because of the tight work schedule, whenever I went for reservist, my boss would be unwilling to let me go on long leave as there was a backlog of work and I had been away for too long, which just doesn't cut it in this line of work. Joe  meanwhile gets to spend his annual holidays going back to India, widening his horizon, buying property back home etc etc. Worse still, I now realise, while peeing next to him in the toilet, that's not only has he got a bigger dick, he has also surpassed me in rank and seniority. I realise those rumours about he downplaying my commitment to the company must be true! he must've said i couldn't be that mobile and engage the clients constantly if i have to be disrupted by this reservist thing where i couldn't even be contactable by handphone... yup how wrong i was. Reservist is not very important for my family. </div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singaporeans are very lucky to have a good and elite government who geniune cares for the average peasant. Straits Times echo the same views as me that PAP MPs whose outpouring of sympathy for the poor is adequate and exceptional.<br><br>Simplistic ideas like a social safety net or unemployment benefits and minimum wages is not going to solve the problem and is also not good for a country. With such an approach, our MPs will not get a chance to show that they care and justify their high class salary.<br><br>Look at USA. They are in hugh debts and yet still going to increase the minimum wages for their people. Their economists say it will have little negative impact on the economy but look at the facts. Thats why their politician are paid peanuts compared to our elite minister. Luckily our government works in a reverse way by minimising wages instead of minimum wages so as to attract more talents.<br><br>They are not only good at keeping our citizen at toes but also help our 3th world neighbours with jobs. By working here, they can definately retire like a king when they go back home. However, the beauty thinking of our elite government is not easily appreciated.</div>

This as an entire package mades Singapore attractive to foreign investment... They with their unique talents of coz deserve a well deserved pay... Who would like to work for another country if not being compenstate enough for their effort? With their talent they could easily work well in their own country.<br><br>Simply said... indirectly you should thank the foriegn talent for your job, without them, these companies would already being in somewhere else cheaper. Only those people who have no proper qualification never study hard in school or work hard in their life would go around complaining this and that. Blaming the society for not giving them their pension like other countries do... why not for once stood up on your own and not rely on the rest of the Singapore to support you little maggots.</div></blockquote>Maggots? R u a singaporean? Why don't u put it. With foreign talent,more top job belonging to Singaporean r being given to FT while jobs like toilet cleaner and plate cleaner r reserve for Singaporean? In the end,the FT only helps a icetip of Singaporean like big bosses who ensure their company remains competitive while <span class="large"><strong>most(70%)</strong></span> singaporean suffers.</div>
