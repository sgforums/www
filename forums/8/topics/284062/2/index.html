It's because we've advanced as human beings, we've become more humane. You can't prevent the birth of killers just by trying to deter them. The entire point of putting someone in jail is to rehabilitate them into society and to ensure they aren't capable of hurting anyone anymore. And if they are succesfully rehabilitated they get released on parole (maybe not in Singapore I'm not sure). If one day your entire family got murdered, tortured and raped and you shot the criminal out of anger you'd want to take back what you said.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The death penalty is meant as a strong deterrence.<br><br>Put it this way. When we are taught criminal law, the most simplistic explanation for the purpose of criminal law is this: The purpose of criminal law is to preserve and protect law-abiding citizens and as a tool of social control. Penalties give a practical incentive to obey the law, and censure those who still choose to break the law.<br><br>We do lock people up in hopes of rehabilitation. But realistically, its more for retribution. The other two reasons would be expiation and incapacitation. We are not as noble as we hope to be. And really, you can't really rehabilitate criminals by locking them up together. You'll more likely breed smarter criminals when they share tips on how to commit crimes.<br><br>As for the death penalty, the only thing I feel is unfair in Singapore is that such cases are heard by only one judge. I personally believe that the jury system is best for such cases. It's been found that juries are typically much better at deciding questions fo fact, leaving the judge free to contend with questions of law. Also, think about it. 12 heads are better than 1. There will be more experience and juries allow community input into what we believe to be right or wrong.<br><br>However, in Singapore, that's not going to happen. The next best thing we can have is to have a panel of 3 judges presiding with a majority verdict needed for conviction. While people may complain about the demands on the court system, I think it is only fair given the severity of punishment. Also, once the sentence is carried out, there is lesser by way of compensation if it were a wrongful conviction. I personally believe it is rather frightening that just one person will decide your guilt.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by jondizzle foshizzle:</div><div class="quote_body">omfg you barbaric crazy bastard...<br><br>Why do you think we don't have the same methods of punishment for crime as we did in the medieval times such as the iron maiden and other methods of torture? It's because we've advanced as human beings, we've become more humane. You can't prevent the birth of killers just by trying to deter them. The entire point of putting someone in jail is to rehabilitate them into society and to ensure they aren't capable of hurting anyone anymore. And if they are succesfully rehabilitated they get released on parole (maybe not in Singapore I'm not sure). If one day your entire family got murdered, tortured and raped and you shot the criminal out of anger you'd want to take back what you said.</div></blockquote><span style="color: blue;">You have taken my points out of context. And you are more likely to be a bastard than me.<br><br>I said hard labour, like old but not like in those medieval times where you once had a life.????. Those times are long gone. Make their life hard, not torture them. Let them reflect what they have done and let those who learn of their story think hard of the consequences. We do have advance as human but becoming more humane? Ask those genocide victim in Darfur or those monks in Myanmar. Advancing only meant that murderders are smarter in action and the authorities are more advance to be ahead of them.<br><br>The idea of jailing a criminal is not only to rehabilitate them. It is also to keep them away from society for good. That is why your country may have sentence without parole. What is the idea to jail them without parole? To pay for their deadly crime. For taking another one's life. You take one, you pay with yours.   Better in jail than to be 'murdered' on the gallow or by lethal injection. If they are rehabilitate, they can still contribute to society from where they are. Be a counselor to the younger offenders, be a pastor, inventor or whatever that is possible and useful to the society. You might wanna check your closet for items made in prison.<br><br>And if one day I shoot the murderer of my entire family, I have the confidence that the justice system will put me away for a period of time, but not for life. </span></div>
