But instead, they chose to forgive, means they wash their hands clean of the responsibility of upholding justice. and surrenders that responsibility to the higher power, in this case, the law.<br><br>the law cannot forgive, the law is just a set of rules.<br><br>but if u're saying that the law should be less strict, maybe instead of death penalty, give life imprisonment. that's a different thing liao.<br><br>haha so is that what you mean?<br><br>personally, i agree with the death sentence. but too bad sometimes people get wrongly accused and die for nothing. but i think seldom happen la.<br><br></div>

Without it, a small and fragile country like Singapore will not survive the influx of notorious crimes.<br><br>An eye for an eye, a life for a life. Murder is liable to death sentence unless provern to be manslaughter. On the other hand, drugs crime such as smuggling and carrying of more than 5g of toxic drugs are direct liable for death sentence. For this, it should be base on case by case basic, but then without such strict enforcing laws, our society maybe become a drug transition centre full of drug addicts n smugglers.<br><br>Contrary to all, nobody should or have the rite to sentence or give a death sentence to a fellow human, because we all human, born to mistakes. And in believe in divine and spiritual existence, God shall be the one who decide.<br><br>When a judge sentence a fellow human to death, he proclaim the convict name against the Citizens of Singapore thereby sentence you(he) to death by hanging till death. So the judge does not hold the liability but instead fall on we, the citizen of singapore. So in 200 over death sentences per years in Singapore changi prison, most are drugs traffickers.

Jail <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span>? That's jail for the rest of your life. Which means you'd be spending the rest of your life doing almost nothing. Life imprisonment is much of a deterrent as the death sentence.<br><br>Even if you don't abolish the death sentence at least do it in a more humane way; death by hanging is an extremely painful way to die and it can take up to 8 minutes for you to lose consciousness. Is it not enough that the person has to be killed that you have to make the last moments of his life the most painful he's ever experienced?</div>

Hundreds of thousands of people do the more harmless drugs and their lives aren't affected the slightest bit.</div>

Will you be able to forgive this person, after what he has done to your loved ones?? Remember this....when the murderer killed your loved ones.....he has sneered at the dying victim and probably spat at the victim with utmost satisfaction too!!<br><br>It is easy to say..."Yes, one is against the death penalty in Singapore" when all is well with one's family....afterall ....the family who has a member murdered is someone else's. The affected family is suffering in anguish and pain but not the unaffected families.<br><br>For all we know, the ppl who are against the death penalty for murderers are those unaffected by the crime  AND the murderer's family themselves.<br><br>For me, I give my full support to the death penalty! Otherwise, we will have ppl murdering ppl, knowing full well that the perpetrators will not have to pay with their lives.....but only have to get the rotan and free lodging and meals and Changi.</div>
