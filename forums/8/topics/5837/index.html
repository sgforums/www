            <div class='col-md body'>i think the two should actually go together cos women reach their sexual peak late in life (35-40?) and guys are at theirs around 18-25(?) so yeah it makes sense! by the time women are at their peak, their freaking husbands are going thru some sorta mid-life crisis! which is why i never understood the older man younger woman thing...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Older women it iz for me =)<br>hehehe... i dunno but all the relations i had were with older women. I find them juz like MsSeus said... mature, more developed *wink* but NOT necessarily more experienced heehee...<br>They are easier to tok to. You can tok about anything with older women and when the relationship ends, they take it much better than the younger girls. You can still remain frenz with ur exs and everything is all good... Maybe its coz they know the relationship will not become serious? i dunno, but as much as i like dating older women, when i'm 28-30, i'd like a wife who's younger than me. Its juz dat rite now, at my age, women around 21-28 are very... stimulating (mentally &amp; physically)....<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i agree with cloun. also, i think a small amount of wrinkles on a woman is rather sexy. and when i say older, i naturally hope for maturity and an earthly philosophical outlook. nothing is more sexy and intriguing than a woman who has seen the world, thought about it and wants to compare it. older women tend to have more mellow voices with better tonal quality. their speech patterns are more confident and most of them think before they speak. major plus in my books.<br><br>ok, now to really sound superficial, about 5 years my senior would be perfect, or 6, or 7, or 8...i draw the line at 45 unless she has a body to die for and a face that does not resemble a prune. sex with an older woman tends to be better because foreplay is a priority. it starts right from wine at dinner to well, the end. plus they tend to be more willing to experiment and open minded about sexuality. a whiff of cologne, a brush of the hand, a sideway glance are all potential starting points for major tumble sessions.<br><br>cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okok, so from what we can tell thru the response, guys like older women. And as i've pointed out, biologically, they do belong together. Just wondering though, how these women view younger guys? I mean we all know that most pple get upset when they breakup, so the fact that these women are ok with it, implies what?? and furthermore, if, say, they're already in their 30s, won't they be under pressure to tie the knot? Unless they treat younger guys like toyboys, i don't see how they can be so flippant about the relationship. Comments??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Gee, I never thought that there'd be a number of guys who are also interested in older women. I was afraid that I'd be one of the rare ones.<br><br>My first love was two years older than me. Sadly she rejected me, boy was I heartbroken.<br>But we're still friends at least. I've been more attracted to older women since, cause I feel that I've got alot to learn from them, and they can better stimulate me emotionally, physically and mentally. As for age difference, 2-5 yrs would be just fine. Although older than that is not a problem with me.<br><br>The main problem is that, IMO, most women aren't really interested in a long term relationship with a younger man. As for MsSeuss's question, I can't really answer it but I'll give it a try. Perhaps when women are dating younger men, they feel sexier and more confidant in knowing that they still have the power to attract them. The whole package(the flowers, little gifts, romance, wild sex etc) makes them feel youthful again. But ultimately still, a younger man cannot provide much more than physical statisfaction.<br><br>I know my thinking's flawed, just sharing my views.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yup... i tink maybe wat auspex say is true...<br>i dun tink older women want commitment when they go out with younger guyz (some do though)... i mean, i went out with this gal who was engaged for 2 yrs before and while we were going out, she kept toking abt stuff dat we would be doing 1 yr from now... scared da crap out of me coz i wasn't really ready for commitment too... i tink younger men do not expect long-term relationships with older women... maybe its dat Oedipus-complex thing..

            <div class='col-md body'>Cloun,<br><br>Oedipus Complex is NOT a 'no like mamma' syndrome. Its a Freudian theory for male comming of age and jealousy. The young boy finds he has to compete with his father for his mother's attention. In the process he develops a sense of protection over her. One reason for this is (and it gets quite sick here) that the act of sex between his parents is interpreted (by him) as violence upon his mother by the father via peneration of penis into vagina. As such this sense of protection and competition causes the young boy to hate (or have murderous intent) his father. All this is meant to be subconscious of course. In the original Greek myth of Oedipus, the protagonist killed his father, married his mother and had sex with her - the irony of which is of course he practised the same 'violence' on her as did his father before him.<br><br>Freud, sick bastard.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>why the heck are you so defensive? i merely saw Oedipus Complex used in the wrong context and just clarified it. i didn't mean to step on your delicate toes. how the heck was i to know it was some esoteric vernacular-enhanced joke?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I dunno what the heck are in their mind, but partners older than us (like me 20, ex bf 31) won't even consider marrying us.  Maybe they know something I don't know.  So when I get to be 30-ish and know what THEY KNOW, I suppose I won't think about marrying some 20 ish men.<br><br>Maybe because women (or issit juz me?)mature faster then men.  My bf (present) has the same age as I do but strangely i feel motherly towards him.<br><br>Anyway, I doubt that I will look for younger men later on in life.  Though Terence and others have convincingly raved about how sexy <span style="font-style: italic;">tiny</span>wrinkles are, how am I supposed to feel confident approaching a young thing (with muscular arms and 6 packs!) when my limbs may jiggle when i brush my teeth?  Maybe instead of feeling like a nymph, I'd feel like an old witch who seduced fresh princes with toad's bile potion.</div>
