Ppl asks me if I have been hurt by a rejection by someone...Ironically the answer is no...I am more hurt if my frens were to ignore me or misunderstand me. To me, affairs of heart can't really perturbed me unless the guy has a special place in my heart...<br>Sounds cruel?but that is the real me...and I know it is unhealthy..one day I will find him....and realise the agony in me to love him as who he is and accept him as a whole.<br>So the guys you meet is different from mine then, they like my spirit and hardiness in the perspective of world views. I am no damsel at all...I fight for whatever is wrong and actually boyish in nature just that my cover on the exterior explains another story of me.

Though I know that the rejection would also be direct, but that's what I like about you, if you dun like me, you would tell me straight, so come on, spur my fire by rejecting me. *smiles*<br><br>-----------------------------------<br><br>Ok, in order not to spoil such a good thread, the buayaing is just that, so now for my contribution.<br><br>Loneliness? hmm...I been alone for 3yrs, though the wait is long, I would prefer to find the one whom I would want to spent the rest of my life with first before I settle for any hunny bunny that jumps into my path. I dun like to be garang guni, and take anyone who wants me, that is if anyone wants me anymore. 3 yrs of being alone, 3 valentines, I yearn to find her, but she never appear. Woman came and woman go, none made me crazy, none made me move, was my standards high? Not really, just a little, but I am rather flexible, for I see beauty in all. And she does not have to make every grade, for I am not that picky. I guess the feeling is just not there and some bad memories at work. Feelings? What do I meant by feelings? Lex is similiar to me in this sense, we go by feelings, she might not be beautiful, se might be, she mght not be them ost intelligent, or she might be, but it all voice down to how comfortable I am, when I am with her. Till now, I can't really find one, not yet, she might be in this forum, she might be just next door, she might be acroos the globe, but I have yet found her. she who can make me crazy. Being alone have it advantages, I can concentrate on my career, I can concentrate on my future, not that I can't when I have her, just that, I would have more reservations before I embark on a risky investment. I can make more gal friends, without fear or worry if she is jealous or not.(And I sure hope she is not, when she comes.) But the drawbacks are there too. I have to rely on my poor little self for support when I face a crisis, I have the pricking feeling at the back of my back, when I see happy couple together in marriage, I have the constant urge to adopt a child when that cute little one runs by. Yes, I am presently giving up such divine happiness for the moment, so that I can meet her, she who can make me crazy.<br><br>Strange words to come from a buaya, but people who knows me well, will know why.<br><br>------------------<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Just my $0.02 + $0.03(from Lex) worth</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Being lonely is different from wanting to be alone.  Loneliness brings sadness.  Without the feeling of being attached to anyone around, it's easy just to opt for a way out, turn off the light and good bye, as if anyone care.  That's why loneliness is dangerous.<br><br>I still don't know how to handle loneliness.  I tried chatting people up but if they brush me off, that's it, I'm going to crumble.  I tried the internet but it seems to me that if you are lonely, chat rooms and forums just amplify the loneliness because these faceless names are more likely to come across as cruel.  A new addiction helps, I'm currently into Pokemon Yellow vesion and with him I am not afraid of loneliness.  While he lasts...<br><br>The best way, to me, is to sleep.  Tomorrow is really another day.  Maybe my mind will not be so clouded with sadness I can see again that I *am* attached to friends, Jade and family.  Maybe it's just the warm sun making it hard to feel lonely. Yeah, I only feel lonely at night, anytime from 8 pm till sunup.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rinoa, I'm not sure, but maybe its going to be quite impossible for you to find THAT guy... I'm quite shocked at what you wrote, cos I'm almost the same, do not feel hurt by rejections, but by frens misunderstanding me... frankly, I always feel that frens and my gf are equally important. At first my gf didn't like dat idea, but she hv got to accept it somehow...<br><br>back to the loneliness part... I'm actually quite surprised that many of you are in those clear-cut cases where you know you prefer loneliness or companionship. I dunno isit my star(Gemini) or what, but I like my time with frens, in crowds and also alone.<br><br>When I'm with frens, I like the communication between us, when I'm in crowds, I like the anonymity, and when I'm alone, I like the peace and time I can do my own things.

            <div class='col-md body'>Like you said, the internet forums(like this one) allow me anonymity(sp) in posting msgs to 'chat' with you guys and gals. Someone once told me that how you may sound on the internet thorugh posting msgs can be very different from the way you actually are in real life. That's pretty true for me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I guess I'm a very reserved kinda guy, very shy and uncomfortable around strangers. Like when you had the various outings, I really wanted to go, but didn't cos I tot that I might be a party pooper. As such, I've not many friends that are close to me. So the feelings of loneliness is always nearby, like now.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> What do I do? Well, like now, I'm just replying to varios topics on the sgforum, just to find something to do. I surf the net, ICQ and play computer games to while the time away. Pathetic isn't it? Ha! Yeah I know. Now I worry about the orientation camps coming up in June, that I hope to make more friends. But, it's pretty frightening and all, cause of my low self esteem. Sometimes I really hate myself. But, that's life!</div>
