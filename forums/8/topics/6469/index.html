            <div class='col-md body'>Of all human emotions, nothing is as fearsome as loneliness. We can be surroundeded by family members &amp; friends &amp; yet something just isn't right. Extreme loneliness can manifest into deep depression &amp; I read somewhere that of all emotions, loneliness is the only one that can &amp; will kill. Even in the bible, in Genesis 2:18, God recognised its danger &amp; made a helpmate for Adam. Just a note for non-Christians, Genesis is the very first book of the bible and for God to even make a note of this horrible feeling in the second chapter of His holy Word just goes to show its possible power of destruction.<br><br>In a way, all of us in this forum are lonely because most of us check in regularly to post replies &amp; maintain links with fellow sgforumites whom we like even though we have never met &amp; maybe may never will.<br><br>How do you deal with prolonged periods of loneliness before it becomes a depression? I try very hard to snap out of it by reading or sleeping it off. Whenever I feel lonely, I love listening to melancholy music which isn't helping things, in fact, I think I like to wallow in it but usually I snap out of it in a couple or few days 'coz I can't stand myself when I'm depressed. If everything fails, I will try to spend time with my nephews or nieces, nothing cheers me up faster than young children. Shopping helps too as do eating but that will make me fatter &amp; then I'll be even more depressed.<br><br>Would love to hear how the rest of you cope with feelings of loneliness.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wah, can relate.<br><br>I totally agree that its can be an addictive feeling even if you think its not good for you. I suppose its a case of better-the-devil-you-know.<br><br>The problem is, once you spend time by yourself, you kind of get uncomfortable when you are suddenly surrounded by heaps of people, for example, in a disco. I guess it because they do not offer you the companionship that you need. You might be surrounded by friends, but they are not talking about or doing things that somehow you know you need to do but can't pinpoint.<br><br>I don't the think the solution to feeling lonely is to surround yourself with other people. Maybe you need some time by yourself,  I mean serious time with yourself, not just climbing to the top of a mountain thinking that the solution will suddenly come to you, to find out what you want, otherwise you are not doing anything constructive.<br><br>Sometimes I watch TV. I think it helps because it takes my mind off stuff and I like doing it. Killing monsters on computers helps too. Or else talking to a close friend.  Someone whose company you enjoy. Worse come to worse, invite him/her out to eat with you. Nothing is more fun than watching other people get fat together with you.<br><br>I also think that sometimes, going with the flow can help. There will be instances when no one has time for you, and you have absolutely nothing to do. These are the times when you need to realize that its nobody's fault, and its a temporary condition that will pass.<br><br>[This message has been edited by pacman (edited 07 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>just a quick post before i dash off to work. btw, thanks for all replies. i'm not that lonely, don't worry, my work &amp; social life is quite packed for me to have time to be lonely all the time. perhaps i've put my topic posting across rather badly. what i meant is that sometimes, inadvertently loneliness descends upon all of us, for women, sometimes it's ascribe to the onset of PMS. what i was asking do you even realise that you're feeling loneliness - this kind of loneliness is not that you've no friends to go out with or you don't feel comfortable when there're people around, it's just a feeling that something or someone is missing from your life. yes, i'm still single but lately in the press there're so many cases of crimes of passions that i'm not too perturbed about my single status yet. anyway, really got to go before i'm horribly late for work.<br><br>tet:<br><br>yes, i know we're never truly alone when we've Christ but sometimes if He has sent a wonderful friend just when you needed one, wouldn't you much have preferred that? thanks for your comforting words.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi colette,<br><br>I feel that all the time, maybe because as the only child. Somehow I find it strange that people came to this world alone and die alone, and in the process of living his/her life, one finds the designated person to be together. Some people chose to remain single and some people found someone that they love.<br><br>Loneliness creeps into everyone's hearts. I don't miss home, but still find myself requiring the company of people. The only way to relieve that loneliness, since I am without a companion, is to live life meaningfully. So, I keep myself occupied that there is a very little spare time kept for myself... Sometimes, I don't know what I am doing and where I am, but nevertheless, work is what keeps me going and even my extra cirricular activities are there to keep me going...<br><br>Loneliness is to endure the presence of a feeling which no one understands...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi pacman,<br><br>DonÂ’t worry, you didnÂ’t write a wrong essay  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">. I posted what I did this morning Â‘coz most of the replies seem to think that IÂ’m lonely &amp; depressed &amp; all of you have been great in giving encouragement, thanks. Also my morning brain translated your Â“Wah, can relateÂ” as Â“Wah, can relax or not?Â” ??!?? I just wanted to clear the air &amp; hope that the other replies (if any) would be on how they deal with feelings of loneliness when it hits them instead of consoling me.<br><br>In fact what you wrote is quite true, I especially agree with you that loneliness is a temporary thing, itÂ’s just like the seasons - it comes &amp; goes, what I would want to do here is to bring peopleÂ’s attention to it &amp; be aware that itÂ’s perfectly okay to feel lonely but we have to be careful that those feelings do not turn into depression because depression would require medical help in most cases.<br><br>What prompted this topic was 2 documentaries that I saw on telly recently - one was on Earthvisions regarding a dolphin which was feeling depressed &amp; simply lost the will to live unless human friends came along to help &amp; another on Channel NewsAsia titled Â“I am ... GraceÂ”. This was a documentary on a young lady who is afflicted with Down Syndrome, she made several comments which touched me. One was that people like them have feelings just like you &amp; me &amp; the other was her reply to the question: Â“If thereÂ’s one thing that you could wish for, what it be?Â” I would have thought that her reply would be: Â“To be normalÂ” but hers was instead this: Â“What would be the price I have to pay if the wish came through.Â”, I donÂ’t remember the actual words but thatÂ’s the gist of it. It really hit me then that not all handicapped people are really handicapped, yes maybe physically but otherwise, theyÂ’re pretty like normal people &amp; there may be in fact things they would not want changed. Grace seems to have very few friends &amp; I sensed the loneliness that she may have felt.<br><br>Another 2 incidents were when I was on the bus home last week (around 5.30 pm) &amp; I happened to sit next to an old lady &amp; somehow we started chatting &amp; sheÂ’s lonely too for she revealed that she spends time taking a bus from one terminal to another &amp; then back home again almost weekly. Does she do that in the hope that some friendly, kind strangers would talk to her &amp; thereby lessen her loneliness? Also last week again on a bus, I saw this old man talking to a young man, an ah beng at that with a girlfriend in tow. HeÂ’s a nice ah beng for he was patient &amp; respectful to the old manÂ’s rattling about the high cost of living, he wasnÂ’t simply listening but he engaged the old man in a conversation with respect &amp; the girlfriend was simply listening with no hint of impatience to this old manÂ’s repetitions, that scene changed my mind about the bengs &amp; the lians, theyÂ’re not that bad after all.<br><br>Then I realised that some of us may feel displaced when we canÂ’t match the pace of living here, that although some of us may have a lot in material things actually do not have enough in things that really counts. I also realised that it doesnÂ’t take a lot to make other people happy - just a smile &amp; the patience to listen to them, to give them the gift of our time. These incidents also prompted me to spend more time with my parents who are pretty old, somehow I always think that theyÂ’re going to be there FOREVER, I have tons of important things to do [like I really do?] but ... I wonder if theyÂ’re lonely when their children out at work &amp; thereÂ’s only 2 of them left in the flat.<br><br>hi sparkle,<br><br>Nah, itÂ’s not weird that you should feeling lonely even when youÂ’re in a group. Read pacmanÂ’s first post 3rd para, I think that could be the reason or maybe you just outgrew your friends.<br><br>Good for you that youÂ’re learning to be happy on your own. ThatÂ’s so wonderful! I think most of us yearn for that perfect someone to complete our lives but in the meantime while weÂ’re searching, we have to learn to be happy without him or her so that if weÂ’re indeed fortunate enough to find them, weÂ’ll be even happier.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>hi prodigal,<br><br>Of course we need friends - genuine friends that is, humans were made to crave phyiscal contact with other humans or animals that can respond to our affections. Come on, youÂ’re only 25 or 26 this year, whatÂ’s the big deal with having a girlfriend? I havenÂ’t had a boyfriend for years and no IÂ’m not ugly just in case anyone is wondering.<br><br>I think youÂ’re feeling restless, youÂ’re searching for something or someone, but this someting or someone is not something or someone you really know.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Sorry! In short, you donÂ’t have a firm idea of what you want, you thought that you wanted this &amp; when you attained this, that victorious feelings lasts but only for a while &amp; the next craving for another something or someone hits you even harder, the hunting process begins all over again. You repeat this process so often that you have no idea what the heck you actually want or youÂ’re doing &amp; you find it becoming more meaningless. Well, hang in there for one day youÂ’ll find peace with yourself even if you donÂ’t have a companion. Maybe IÂ’m way off base, but that was how I felt when I was younger. Now, I am wiser (hopefully) &amp; I think less uptight about what others think of me &amp; my actions &amp; I also have a firmer idea of what I want out of life.<br><br>You know what Phil Collins said, you canÂ’t hurry love. Be patient &amp; ever hopeful (unless youÂ’re like 26 going on 96), one day your dream girl may just drop in your lap!<br><br>Just remember, loneliness canÂ’t get the better of us if we donÂ’t allow it. Just like everything else, it only has the power to hurt us when we give it the power to do so.<br><br>Time for dinner!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Colette,<br><br>I know what I want, and could not understand why you keep interpreting me as someone who don't know what I want. Either you have something against me, or you don't understand me. It is not about what I want most of the time, it is about whether the other person want it or not. I have put it clearly once : all I ever want is to find that someone, marry her, and give her a happy life, and the rest is secondary. I don't need to think about a career, because it is something that is easily attainable to me. I wish that sometimes, there is someone who could come into my life, and give me all the love and affection, and relieve me from the burden of my pain and sorrows, and eventually push me to a higher point. But love is not about finding someone and relieving you of pain. It is about finding someone and devoting that love to her. I always know what I wanted, and it is very simple and it is the gift of romantic love.<br><br>There are many ways of dealing with loneliness. Just that I choose to put myself with loads of work and committment so that I won't have that spare moment in time, where I have to feel that I am lonely. It is your choice, and it is your life. That is coming from a 25 year old virgin who can drive. If you want my opinion, you would find it exceptionally tough that all your classmates are getting married and hitched in one way or another.<br><br>Nevermind...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Prodigal<br><br>Sorry. I did write that I can be way off, anyway, that was how I felt a few years back. No, I donÂ’t have anything against you, may be I just donÂ’t understand you well.<br><br>Oh, so sweet that youÂ’re eager to love someone &amp; be married &amp; you got something right, itÂ’s not about what you want most of the time, it is about whether the other person wants it or not. See? ThatÂ’s the whole trouble, sometimes we meet people whom we love so much but alas they donÂ’t even know that we exist. ThatÂ’s why I advised you to be patient and wait for your best possible dream mate. Unless you donÂ’t mind doing all the loving &amp; giving and she all the taking for thereÂ’re gals like that, they prefer to be loved more than to love. Btw, you donÂ’t have to announce to the entire Internet world that youÂ’re still a virgin.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> CouldnÂ’t resist that, no malice intended.<br><br>I read your other posting under the Â“What do women wantÂ”, you mentioned the x-factor, yeah nobody knows how falling in love works, I only know that itÂ’s taking a long heck of a time coming to me. I think most of the time love doesnÂ’t seem to come is because we [okay, maybe I] donÂ’t take the time &amp; effort to give the other party a chance, sometimes, we come across a minor flaw &amp; thatÂ’s it, we slowly begin to write them off &amp; we put too much emphasis on that lovely dovely feeling, personally, I think the first flush of love fades within a few months to be replace a comfortable loving feeling and we panic because we expected the passion to last longer. Anyway, IÂ’m no expert on love, IÂ’m lousy at relationships &amp; IÂ’m hankering after the impossible man, so IÂ’ll just have to wish you all the best.<br><br>FYI, most of my friends are already married &amp; thereÂ’re little replicas of them running around, do I find it tough, yes, but only when I face setbacks and during the Christmas to ValentineÂ’s Day (VD) period, either the air is thick with the lonely virus or the cupids are just happy shoving my single status in my face &amp; having fun at my expense. IÂ’m a sucker for love during the Dec to Feb period.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Hey guys one big tip here, the best time to get a girlfriend is during this period, however, be warned that you may be ditched after VD.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Anyway, once VD is out of the way, IÂ’m the happy swinging single again until December, darn it!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Whatever your choice, prodigal, be happy  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">, thatÂ’s my wish for you.

            <div class='col-md body'>hi colette,<br><br>i think loneliness is someting that everyone can relate to and that no one is immune to loneliness unless maybe you are a siamese twin.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> sorry that was evil... sometimes i try to get together with frens or do some work to occupy myself. but it does not work that well, offering only temporary relief. sleeping also offers temporary relief. hmmm... i love listening to melancholic music too when i am lonelyor depressed. recently i was listening to "i love you" by sarah mclachlan. hehe wonderful melancholic song!<br><br>but i think wat works best to cure loneliness is to do the hardes thing, reach out to someone! it is sooooo difficult though. i know that it is one of Christ's commands, to love one another but sometimes it is so hard, dun you think? also in this day and age, everyone is so individualistic and we are sotempted to follow suit. *sigh* but God's love will flow through those believe. even for non christians, i think that this is the way to actually get over loneliness? to reach out? it will come back to you somehow...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>just my 2 cents...<br><br>------------------<br>Let him that move the world, first move himself.</div>

Tsk, tsk,  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> I was never hostile towards you, perhaps my language has been a bit strong in the beginning but I harbour no hostilities towards you.  DidnÂ’t watch the movie Â“CluelessÂ” at all, so IÂ’m really clueless as to the significance of your remark about being a virgin &amp; able to drive.<br><br>Thanks for your wish, but actually IÂ’m too lazy to search, lousy at the dating &amp; flirting game &amp; I find that they take up too much time &amp; energy. IÂ’m lazy to that extend that I hope God will just let me meet &amp; fall in love with the right guy &amp; that heÂ’ll love me too, dating just to sieve the wheat from the chaff, gosh, that mere thought is enough to kill my interest in looking for a boyfriend. Maybe itÂ’s just another phase IÂ’m going through or maybe itÂ’s just my 3 am brain talking. Do keep us posted when you find a girlfriend.

            <div class='col-md body'>Colette<br>I can relate to u cos I think it is perfectly fine to be single too and not becos we are ugly but becos we want to find the right one and hit it right...Well, maybe becos of the high expectations too that makes our search harder to attain and I have to agree that sometimes the ideal is just there but you just have got to find it and grasp it. But have you ever wondered that too much choices can be a hassle too?<br><br>Ppl are complaining that they have no one in their lives that pays real attention to them but how many understand if one being too desrable..it is a threat to any existing relationship..giving gitters to the bf and think he is not as good as his contenders..and as such...So that is why it is important to find a guy with great confidence and trust in me...at least this time, I know that the next one will be the final one and I dun mind taking sometime to search for the Ultimate one..even it might take years...cos it is such a hassle to get in and out of a relationship or ppl might think u are a player or as such...<br><br>So maybe you can share how u think to see if we are sorta in sync?<br>My...

            <div class='col-md body'>Lonliness is not entirely a bad thing colette. Not everything is worth doing, not all friends are worth making. If you're lonely because you think you're missing something, don't.<br><br>Since you quote from the Bible, I suppose you would know that men of God like Elijah had to go through periods of lonliness. It is recorded on numerous occasions that the Lord Jesus went off to be alone so that he could pray.<br><br>And yes, the Lord also felt terribly alone when he cried out "Eloi, eloi, lama sabathani". My God, My God, why have you forsaken me? At that moment when He bore the sins of the world on his shoulders, He was cut off from the Father because of that. And was he ever cut off before? Never.<br><br>So take courage. Being lonely is part of life. David was very, very lonely during certain trying periods. It's all recorded in the Psalms. You aren't alone, the Lord is with you.<br><br>------------------<br>This is merely the path I have chosen. You decide yours.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, this is my second post to this forum  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>I find this forum a much more conducive place to discuss things. I used to visit soc.culture.singapore but the people there are ... sigh. One more thing, my english is really lousy so please pardon me ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Okay, about loneliness, please allow me to contribute my 5 cents worth.<br><br>Frankly, I am a person who enjoy loneliness but I like to be in a crowd at times too. Basically I enjoy both. And I always believe that we need some time to be alone every now and then.<br><br>When I was younger, I had always wanted to know more friends, observe them and analyse their characters. But when I grow older, I am more interested to know who I am. Hence I spend more time with myself, trying to find out what kind of person I am. I even travel alone, putting myself in unfamiliar environment and see how I respond to it. I am wierd right ? Haha  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>But after all these years I had indeed known myself better. I know what I want and what my needs are. What I cannot accept and live with. What is important to me and what are things that I can give up. Now I am more ready to know other people and more ready to help them know me.<br><br>My wish now is to know my parents more. I dunno them well. I simply live with them. But I don't really KNOW them. Their presence are simply taken for granted. They are growing old and I just wish that I can know them well before they leave me forever.<br><br>My good old fren Buddha said that "everything happens for some reasons"<br>If you are lonely now, there must be some lessons for you to learn from it. So, try to learn from it, you will become a wiser person everyday  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Loneliness is part of our lives. If you want to enjoy life, you should enjoy loneliness too.

            <div class='col-md body'>After reading Littleman and Angeldark's posts I had a new take on the discussion of loneliness. I might be stating the bleeding obvious, but it sure is new to me.<br><br>I think people get lonely because their immediate emotional needs are not met. Thats why people feel that they haven't found their lover who can totally understand them. Thats why people who have close friends and relatives and a busy social life can still get lonely.<br><br>I suppose the company and understanding provided by a lover is different from those provided by friends and family and pets, and sooner or later this unfulfilled part will manifest itself, be it the need for girls to put away the independent strong outward appearence and just enjoy the feeling of being protected but their man; or the need to guys to show all vulnerabilities and yet still know that they are loved and treasured; or just to be held.<br><br>Angeldark, thats why you said you prefer to be lonely but can still get lonely sometimes. Your threshold for certain type of company is low, so you are easily satisfied and can choose to be lonely, but your needs for that special category for someone is just as high as anyone else, so you still feel lonely. No?<br><br>Well don't get addicted to the feeling anyway, if you feel lonely. Like most posters have shown, they have been able to get on with their lives in the meantime.<br><br>Now go for the outings and get me some pics.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by pacman (edited 11 March 2000).]</div>
