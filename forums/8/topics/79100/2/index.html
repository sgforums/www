The audio is a few seconds ahead of the video; suddenly you hear a chorus of screams and shouts that donÂ’t match the video. <strong>Then, as the yelling and keening intensifies, the one who read the statement puts away the paper, pulls a long knife out of his shirt, leaps onto Nick Berg and begins sawing his head off. </strong> Another one jumps on NickÂ’s back and pins his arms as he dies. The others caper and dance, calling out Â“Allahu Akhbar!Â”<br><br><strong>The screaming and gagging is nightmarish. And itÂ’s not quick.</strong><br><br>The video <strong>ends with one of these creatures holding up BergÂ’s head while the camera pans in for close-ups of the head and body. And the lake of blood.</strong><br>[/b]</blockquote>I watched till he finished all his talking, and I offed my WMP.<br><br>Heh.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nonsense, those militants killed the very person who was trying to help them. As you can see if you read around a little, the ordinaty Iraqi is also repulsed by the murder of this person for nothing more then shallow political reasons as they are about the senseless prision abuse.<br><br>Frankly, those people doing their <span style="font-style: italic;">viva la resistance</span> don't have a clue on what to do with their lives and future, they are just living their own fantasy of struggle against a grossly overblown threat. The inescapable truth is, the only way things are gonna improve in Iraqi is if the americans and UN stay in there and build up that nation. Driving them out is prehaps the most counterproductive thing they can do now, but hey, these people prefer fantasy to reality.<br><br>Oil theories are nuts as well, the Iraqis are in hardly any position to get rich on their resources on their own. Left to their own devices, they can do little about their resources, given their infrastructure, stability and the like. You have plenty of different factions witin the local poulation wanting a piece of the pie with little regard for the future of the commoner. Unless some form of democracy and proper central government is installed, Iraqi goes nowhere.<br><br>What good is driving out the americans and the world from their soil, and having what's left of their nation when they can't do anything about their situtation? In fact, leaving them like that is the vicious cycle that sells more people into pointless fantasies of blowing themselves and for no real cause.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>got this from another forum:<br><br>The picture the media is now showing of the guy the terrorist beheaded as revenge for what went on in the Iraqi prisons looks odd to me. If you look at the men dressed in black, they all seem well fed. Actually most look fat.<br><br>That bothers me, because these guys are fighting a war and eating on the run. They are constantly on the move and should be either very fit and trim or scrawny and malnourished because of the same reasons.<br><br>One thing they should not be is fat like couch potatoes. If you look at all of the photos of the prisoners who were naked who supposedly were just plucked of the street, most of them are thin.<br><br>1) extremely convenient "wag the dog" timing at the height of furor<br>regarding U.S. torture of Iraqis<br><br>2) CNN poll question: "Is the Berg killing a reason for withholding any<br>remaining Iraq prisoner abuse pictures?" Bush has been reported to be<br>struggling with question of whether Pentagon should release additional<br>torture photos. Given that the alleged decapitation of Berg was allegedly<br>prompted by the first wave of torture photos, Bush could now cite "national<br>security" issues for witholding additional materials.<br><br>3) Berg's last known whereabouts was in U.S. custody.<br><br>4) Berg shown in video wearing orange jumpsuit known to be of U.S. issue<br>(compare with pictures at Guantanamo).<br><br>5) Berg mysteriously captured by Al-Quaeda (still wearing jumpsuit). Either<br>he escaped from U.S. captors or U.S. let him out -- with orange suit and<br>all -- to be immediately apprehended by Al-Quaeda (before he had a chance to<br>change).<br><br>6) Tape obviously spliced together and heavily edited. Goes from a) Berg<br>sitting in chair talking about family, to b) Berg sitting on floor with<br>hooded "militants" behind, to c) blurry camera movement, to d) almost<br>motionless Berg on floor as head cut off.<br><br>7) Audio clearly dubbed in.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> "Arab" reader flips through pages of "statement" and keeps ending up on<br>the same page. Perhaps doesn't even known enough Arabic to recognize what<br>page he's on?<br><br>9) "Arabs" have lily-white hands and (other exposed) skin.<br><br>10) "Arabs" have Western-style body posture and mannerisms. OWNED!<br><br>11) When Berg decapitated, there was almost no blood. If Berg were still<br>alive at this point, with the cut starting at front of throat, blood would<br>have been spraying everywhere. Berg's severed head, the floor, Berg's<br>clothes, and even the hand of the "Arab" who decapitated Berg had no visible<br>blood on it. OOPSIE<br><br>12) Berg's body didn't move while on the ground. Although held down, Berg<br>would have tried to instinctively wiggle and writhe away from captor's grip. GEE YA THINK?<br><br>13) Camera angle made it impossible to see if Berg's eyes were even open.<br><br>14) Alleged "scream" from Berg sounded to be that of a woman and was clearly<br>dubbed in.<br><br>15) Berg goes to great trouble to identify himself, providing information<br>about his family. Why? To elicit greater sympathy? Or to provide a<br>positive ID. FBI visited Berg family in an attempt to "verify his<br>identity". Guy in video looks very little like Berg photos provided by<br>family.<br><br>I believe that Berg (or this lookalike character) was first killed (perhaps<br>by lethal injection, poisoning, etc.), then decapitated after dead (explains<br>lack of blood spraying everywhere). Berg was killed by Al-Quaeda (known to<br>be a CIA - Mossad joint venture). Berg video released at height of furor<br>over U.S. torture of Iraqis and just before Bush was to decide whether to<br>release additional torture videos. Now torture videos will be witheld from<br>public for reasons of national security. Now "patriots" everywhere will<br>laud the virtues of U.S. torture of "enemies". Sensitivity level of public<br>gets heightened in terms of what's acceptable treatment of prisoners.<br>Juxtaposed with decapitation, piling naked men into pyramid is nothing.<br>Such treatment will be considered more and more acceptable even in domestic<br>situations. George W. Bush sleeps well tonight while Berg family lives in<br>torture. Serves Berg's father right for opposing Bush and the war of<br>aggression against Iraq.<br><br></div>
