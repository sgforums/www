Note: GRADES Always come first, then CCAs n NS. if you dont make the cut, and let's assume there's one empty seat where two with similarly lower grades fighting for it, their CCAs, NS will come into place. and when you appeal for entry while re-taking As due to GP or absent from a subject... THESE will affect you. If you have really good grades.. then u can forget abt sispec or ocs. but if you're the borderline cases, here's a chance to redeem yourself while you fight for it. And moreover, if you need to retake A levels or something like that, chances are, given the rights as an officer, specialist, you'll be more likely excused from your duties than others.<br><br></div></blockquote>The diff. is that Jan intake has all the scholars in it. if u are no scholar, then academically wise both are the same or even worse lah. (eg. me lol) fitness wise both are the same lah, otherwise they have to undergo ptp training already. i have to agree jan intake got more percentage become commanders but this got to do with those scholars (sign on) and also demand and supply esp for new specs to takeover ORD personnels.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Privileges are no rights. You gotta get that right. You can have the privilege but it can be taken away from you. You can fight for privileges, but still the process will take too long when you need it and when it was addressed, you probably cant utilised it. That is the understanding you must have.<br><br>You had to condone to the military ground operation needs before your privileges. Any CO has the right to refuse any privileges without even the need to answer for his action even if it concerns your future. You need to know the difference between privileges and rights. You have no rights to retake A levels and leaves are considered rights that needs approval from CO and with the understanding that it'll be considered privilege if operational requirements state that you need to cover more military operations due to the nature of your unit. An example was the increased security after the 911 incident. So taking too many things for granted is a fallable cause.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Travey:</div><div class="quote_body">officers will definitely have that kind of privilege among many others. what i wanna say is being a man doesn't mean u are cut off from all forms of privileges lah. some still can fight for it. esp if it concerns ur future. anw have to go study liao. tmr got test ah.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </div></blockquote></div>
