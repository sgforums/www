And a specialist is usually given important roles. However, the initial training may be harsh, but essential to strengthen the force. It should not be taken lightly, though most of the time it was misunderstood.<br><br>If you think you're a role model for fellow friends and extremely helpful, going for sispec might be a good option as you'll learn to exercise these abilities.<br><br>Moreover, it enhances your chance of application for a local University.<br><br>Note: NUS and NTU takes into account of your NS liabilities, and your CCAs. If you had not had any CCAs, you must work hard to at least obtain a specialist or officer position. Being a men of corporal rank gives u 0 advantage when you apply for your university.

            <div class='col-md body'>i think the specialists importance realli canot be over-emphasised. they are the closest to the men, and they are the "specialists" in their field. they may seem to be sandwiched between the officers and the men, but this unique position gives them the advantage of being on the ground yet exposed to certain level of planning, and they are required to bridge the gap between the 2. if u can become a well-respected spec by both the men and the officers, u would realli haf done very well!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yah, but it gives them the lousy thing of doing the most thing and not getting paid enough.  If want to take up responsiblities may as well go for officer and get the highest pay possible and do the least job, its not like u are going to make a career out of this.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you realised the April Batch = Either unfit, or Weaker in studies.<br><br>January Batch usually consist of those who will be likely to command good grades. And when you happen to be the borderline case, you'll have to depend on CCAs, and probably appeal, re-appeal, apply, re-apply type... You have to deliver the goods in NS. Note: GRADES Always come first, then CCAs n NS. if you dont make the cut, and let's assume there's one empty seat where two with similarly lower grades fighting for it, their CCAs, NS will come into place. and when you appeal for entry while re-taking As due to GP or absent from a subject... THESE will affect you. If you have really good grades.. then u can forget abt sispec or ocs. but if you're the borderline cases, here's a chance to redeem yourself while you fight for it. And moreover, if you need to retake A levels or something like that, chances are, given the rights as an officer, specialist, you'll be more likely excused from your duties than others.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Travey:</div><div class="quote_body">Sure anot?

            <div class='col-md body'>errrh that where u are wrong, there are more men then spec or officer, if u are officer and u need to retake your A'level, no way u have time to go and study and retake one. If u are man, there are lots of people who can replace you for the same job, not true if u are an officer.</div>
