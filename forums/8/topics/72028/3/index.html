            <div class='col-md body'>wow... look at how this thread turned out to be..<br><br>i think there are plenty of issues to discuss here ie. whether nsf officers are keng, whether specs are more important blahblahblah<br><br>but i think it boils down to the individual. how much pride and effort u put into your work will show in the end, irregardless of your rank.<br><br>i know plenty of us out there in the service, irregardles of nsf or reg status are plain unhappy with the way we are treated. well there's no way this can be resolved. i'm sure no matter how high ranking or how capable your commander is, he'll def have something that you absolutely dislike, be it the way he punishes you or the way he picks his nose. bottomline is, there are only two ways to improve your life.<br><br>1) you go right up to him, sit him down over a nice cup of coffee and have a chat and understand why he does things the way he does. ie, maybe he should use his pinkie to pick his nose instead of his thumb. that way he'll know he's doing something others percieve as wrong and maybe make an effort to change. OR he could give u a clearer understanding of why he does things that particular way,maybe he's forced to, maybe he has his reasons. but rem to do it in an amicable manner. dun turn it into a deathmatch. i'm very sure your commander will appreciate the feedback and the willingness of his men to work with him. Hey, everybody's human<br><br>2) just shut up and live with it, making the best out of every situation. this would prob be the way most ppl adopt and there's really not in need of an explanation cause its inbred anyway<br><br>I prefer the former and i actually do implent it in my unit when i see conflicts forming. i've actually dragged an entire (section size equivalent) group into a meeting room just to address a trivial issue cause one of them was a bit too slack. in the end, they didn't gel to be the bestest of friends, but at least they formed a professional workin relationship that ensured the job was done well enough.<br><br></div>
