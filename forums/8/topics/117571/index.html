            <div class='col-md body'>Some say the Taj Mahal pre-dates Shahjahan by several centuries and was originally built as a Hindu or Vedic temple complex.<br>These photographs are taken from an album that was found and then smuggled out of India. On the back of each photo there is a stamp mark that says, "Archaeology Survey of India." This signifies that they were the property of that institution. This means a number of things: That the Archaeology Survey of India (ASI) has been researching the evidence that proves the Taj Mahal and many other buildings were not of Muslim origin, and that they know this information but remain silent about it.The sealed rooms at Taj have always been a mystery. Archaeologists are probably worried about tinkering with it, because it might lead to a whole slew of Hindu vs. Muslim riots<br><br>One of the 22 rooms in the secret storey underneath the marble plinth of the Taj Mahal. Many such features of the Taj remain unknown to the public so long as they see it only as a tomb. If the public knew how much it is missing in the Taj Mahal it will insist that the government unseal its many stories. Two doorways at either end of this corridor in the right side wall leading to inner apartments have been sealed by Shahjahan. If those doorways are opened, important evidence concealed inside by Shahjahan may come to light.<br><br>The Taj Mahal has seven stories. Five of them lie sealed and barred concealing rich evidence. The marble building in the centre is flanked by two symmetrical ones. The one in the foreground is the eastern one. The one in the background is being represented as a mosque because it is to the west. They should not have been identical if only one was to be a mosque. In the courtyard at the foot of the eastern building is inlaid a full scale replica of the trident pinnacle [found at the top of the dome]. The tiny tower at the left near the western building, encloses a huge octagonal multi-storied well.<br>This is the massive octagonal well with palatial apartments along its seven stories. A royal staircase descends right down to the water level indicated by the tiny white patch showing the sun's reflection.<br><br>This was the traditional treasury well of the Hindu temple palace. Treasure chests used to be stacked in the lower stories. Accountants, cashiers and treasurers sat in the upper stories. Cheques called handies used to be issued from here. On being besieged, if the building had to be surrendered to the enemy, the treasure used to be pushed into the water for salvage later after recapture. For real research, water should be pumped out of this well to reveal the evidence that lies at the bottom. This well is inside a tower near the so-called mosque to the west of the marble Taj. Had the Taj been a mausoleum this octagonal multistoried well would have been superfluous.</div>

Three Hindu gods. The one at the left known as Ayu Devata (God of life) is still invoked in Siberia if some near and dear one falls seriously ill. The other two are just samples of the many gods and goddesses sold in the bazar of Ulan Bator, the capital of Mongolia. <strong>These indicate how Hinduism prevailed in the ancient world.

            <div class='col-md body'>what bahi dude says is true, Hindu culture was widepread in olden times..i think Buddhuism was brought from India to China by Gautama.This vedic culture has have been the only universal culture since the dawn of mankind and Christianity, Islam may have been derived from there. It makes sense and  there is evidence proving that religions were derived from one another.Its only logical that early man had to start from somewhere<br><br>Bhai has all his points covered, so i suggest not arguing with him any more before he makes a fool out of u <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>MunnaBhai's posts are informative and one can see that he does gereat research on unconventional subjects.Now how many of u here actually do that.Stop ridiculing him and learn from what he posts. I feel its better than reading other non educational crappy posts</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To add on to the above post ,I had read about the controversy of Taj Mahal.<br><br>Sckeptics believe that it was originally a Hindu temple or designed by hindu architects and that Islam never existed during those times.The theory suggests that the whole thing was a fabrication by opposers of the Hindu religion who created an alternate religion called Islam.A western researcher did intense research on the subject and subsequently published a book.The book never made it to the public.It was banned by the Indian government as they didnt want anyone rewriting their country's history.If i am not wrong , this was during the rule of Indira Ghandi's goverment.Again there is a downside to the story, if the Taj Mahal was done by Islam architects they could have been inspired by Hindu religions and culturesas it was widepread in those times<br><br>I dont dispute the fact that all civilisation might have been originally from India and that a very complicated society calling themselves as people from the vedic culture was reigning at the time .They could have spread their immense knowledge to other continents and educated those people.These people might have had a jumpstart and awakened created their own religions and cultures evolving over time which continue till today.<br><br>A lot of research has been and still ongoing on India's past and they have just too much on their plate.Now its known that India had an advanced civilisation called the RAMA empire  way before Taj Mahal times  similar to the atlanteans and  had nuclear capabilities.Ancient manuscripts prove that They were constantly at war with Atlantis. No one knows how a nuclear holocaust could have happened in Rajastan in the past, its just baffling.But there is intangible proof that it happened. there have been manuscripts found saying that ancient Indian kings had nuclear like devices at their disposal with instructions on how to built one  and this what Atlantis was after and unwilling to surrender their weapons, they had used it on themselves<br>The nuclear weapon that India possessed was called  "Rama's Arrow" and it was  restricted to  only benevolent aristocracy of the Rama civilisation <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Note: other sites in India have also been found similar to the Rajastan site is is believed to be testing grounds for the RAMA empire.So it further proves that some kind of nuclear testing was going on in the past.This also means that India had already done nuclear testing long long ago.I dont know how Bush or Clinton or the UN will feel about this! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Josyer, director of the International Academy of Sanskrit Research in Mysore, India, stated on September 25, 1952, that Indian manuscripts several thousands of years old dealt with the construction of various types of aircraft for civil aviation and for warfare.<br>"The specific manuscript on aeronautics included plans for three types of vimanas (aircraft), the Rukma, Sundara, and Shakuna. Five hundred stanzas of an ancient text treat of such intricate details as the choice and preparation of metals which would be suitable for various parts of vimanas of different types."<br>"There were eight chapters...that provided plans for the construction of aircraft that flew in the air, traveled under water, or floated pontoon-like on the water's surface. Some stanzas told of the qualifications and training of pilots."</div>
