            <div class='col-md body'>I would like to share my opinions regarding the recent bandwagon of Â“para paraÂ” dance among many teenagers. The dance itself is a form of exercise, which is harmless. Its widely availability in arcade entertainment centers is also a safe environment for teenagers. However, there is a side effect to such a popular dance, which is based on techno music.<br><br>Many teens are drawn to the attention of dancing from an initial admiration of fellow friends. However, due to peer pressure, they quickly pick up the habit of dancing so as not to be felt left out. In addition, at their age, they fulfill the minimum requirement stipulated to enter a discotheque. Some wanted to improve on their skills in dancing, thus visiting discotheque becomes more frequent.<br><br>The problem comes in when they wanted to explore more and becomes addicted. In the complicated environment of any nightspots, innocent teens are subjected to the influence and temptation of alcohol, smoking and possibility of drug trafficking. The initial interest in dancing might put a teen into such a dangerous situation.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>I am not trying to advocate that nightspots should be banned. There are of course people who go purely for entertainment and fun. But it is those black sheep who make use of the environment to engage in illicit activities that harms innocent partygoers. What I am trying to point out is that at a tender age of 21 and below, most teens are easily tempted by monetary rewards for small services rendered. This is esp so when Spore is continuly being termed as a "soft society", hence there could be a trend whereby teens seek out easy ways to make money<br><br>Perhaps the authorities should put a check on the age limit for entering such nightspots, especially young innocent girls who often fall into prey of lecherous wolf out there. The sad thing is, gals usually are admitted into discotheque at a younger age while guys are at an older age. This facilitates the more mature guys to scheme against younger gals who might still be immature and cannot judge b/w right or wrong, thus falling into the trap.We won't want to wait till something happens before actions are taken, do we?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Looks like some kind of physiotherapy to me...  you pay a couple of bucks just to swing your arms around in time to music.  Oh go on... argue that it's a harmless workout... argue all you want till I point out that the Great Singapore Workout gives you the same thing:  music and good exercise.<br><br>And I'm willing to bet my last dollar that not more than the occasional straggler who stops to watch the idiot on the platform actually thinks that the player is l337 and looks vaguely intelligent esp if there's a small entourage of backup dancers behind him/her, playing for free.  If they'd spend the amount of time they do on the machine doing something more intellectually stimulating, oh say, watching the grass grow... they just might recover.<br><br>It's not dance.<br><br>It's a symptom...<br><br>...of something serious, no doubt.<br><br>[This message has been edited by H3X4D3CiM4L (edited 16 July 2001).]</div>
