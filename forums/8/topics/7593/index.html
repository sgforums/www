This is a paradox involving time travelling. I read in a book which offers an explanation in this paradox.<br><br>It is said that every move you made will create another parallel universe or timeframe. If time travel is possible and you travel back to the past, you will end up in another parallel timeframe B which will not intersect with your own timeframe A. Therefore, if you were to kill your father in timeframe B, it will only affect timeframe B and not timeframe A. And if you are able to return to timeframe A, you will find that your father is still alive, whereas in timeframe B, you wouldn't have exist.<br><br>Please correct me if I'm wrong. Thanks!<br></div>

When you are out, the world has aged like maybe 10 years, wouldn't that be time travel??

            <div class='col-md body'>two extreme to the idea.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>1. if time travel is possible, we would have known about it very much earlier. i mean, surely a person would have travelled back and made some kind of announcement. then again, maybe 4 digit years are not significant enough. perhaps time travel was invented in year 20319, so they found it more significant to travel back to something like year 10000 to make the annoucement. aiyo, then again, the person might still be travelling...<br><br>2. maybe time travel has been invented in the future. but banned from use by government regulations ? then again, it's such a potential catastrophic invention only highly trusted ranked governmental personnel can use it ? bill clinton might already have been in conversation with lee kuan yew super junior over the possible merger of singapore and US.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>last time when i was interested in the idea of time travel, i had this crazy notion that all instances of events are present at any one time. meaning that everything thru' our eyes are present as frames that move us along. and all frames are defined by the usual 3-dimensional measures as well as a fourth dimension, time. as you all know, light alters physical dimensions, weight, time span. so my crazy notion is not entirely false. what's tough to visualise is how we can "physically" capture each frame, and do the actual time travel. of course, time travel doesn't strictly require you to physically move. if you can travel faster than light and end up in a planet a few million light years away, you might be just in time to look at the light waves that propogate pictures of you being born on earth.<br><br>of course, it's just a crazy notion.</div>
