I remember during my unit days, my PC was just as idiotic as whoami6969. He assumed with his rank {He is regular and has held LTA for 3 years <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">} he could command respect from the men. He started to treat us like crap and shit. There was once he lost an 840 during exercise and he tried to shift the blame to all the PSO signallers. Too bad for him by SOP all PSO signallers carry 940s and it is really stupid to imagine us carrying 2 signal sets and doing mission at the same time. But that bugger refused to give up and tried to shift blame to the obese guy in my platoon who incidently is even fitter than him <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">. Finally the RSM found it and by the equipment log and serial number of each signal set, we manage to trace it back to him <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">. Well he got off lightly with 21 extras. Now you can start understanding why when we "dao pao" food for him in the cook house, there will be extra ingrediants <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">.<br><br>On the other hand, my CSM was a hard hitting no nonsense man. He goes on his job professionally and most importantly is willing to stand by his men when trouble arises. This is what I call a leader. Finally it boiled down to the point that we look up to our CSM as our "PC" rather than the stupid LTA.</div>
