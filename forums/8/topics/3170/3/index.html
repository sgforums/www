            <div class='col-md body'>Yawnz.<br><br>Being an officer would mean u are above the rest, but being arrogant and ignorant while u are at it is another story. In the SAF, we talk about command and respect. The rank gives the command, but not the respect.<br><br>whoami6969:<br><br>Well, I can tell u I am a specialist. And from my own experience with many officers, there are good ones and bad ones. Everybody tries to make things happen, not discard things when they looked bad from the start.<br><br>About your remark of 43 men to make a officer, well, I do scoff at it if u don't mind. Cos there seems to be more men who seems to be doing better than a officer in terms of their own personal life.<br><br>Well, I have nothing more to add, but seriously, u would need all those luck u can get when u enter reservist. Cos life in reservist ain't what u think it is. All this NATO is making me bored and sleepy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Inexperienced I may be, I do not deny that fact, so let me put it simply, does OCS produce this kind of attitude in their officers? Correct me if i am wrong, but i have nothing to say if you are a Commandos or Guards officer. SOC (or even SEOC) time of under 8 minutes, so what? Does your bars give you the power to show off such a mentality here? Spare us please.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is pretty obvious that this person is placing so much attachment to this order called "rank".This self-created system of "SAF" is only an illusion that one person may hope to enjoy for 2.5 yrs and a few other reservist yrs if he isn't a regular.Let us further examine the fact that rising of ranks are non-dependent on one's true capabilities but more of how much bootlicking you do and how much of a class performance(wayang) that you give.To sum it up : Once you leave those camp gates after the ORD date,come up to the real civillian world,lift up your chin and tell ppl of your rank...and wait for them to laugh and tease you for still living in your imaginary world.<br><br>------------------<br>Because anyone hides pain in the depths of their hearts.Or so I knew.<br>If there's a reason to fight in this time, this place,<br>Then I can fly, without being afraid of being lost.<br>I unsheath only my rage.<br>Live now, in everything</div>
