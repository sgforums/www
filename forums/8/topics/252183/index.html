            <div class='col-md body'>Once I took a taxi to a veterinarian with my dog. My dogÂ’s cough attracted the attention of the taxi driver. He turned and asked, "Has your dog caught the flu?" "Yeah! He has been coughing since last night," I replied. With a long sigh, he said, "Gee, the way it coughs sounds just like a human being." As the conversation continued, he told me of a painful experience he had in raising a dog.<br><br>Several years prior, he had a huge German shepherd. It ate a LOT and its fierce barking bothered the neighbors. Soon, he could no longer afford to keep the dog. So he put it in a bag and drove it to a mountain, over 100-km away, abandoning it there. The dog ran after his car for several kilometers and then dropped out of sight.<br><br>A week later, at midnight, he heard something knocking heavily at the front door. It was his German shepherd, looking haggard and exhausted from an apparent long period of running and searching. He was surprised but said nothing. He turned, grabbed the same bag, put the dog in and drove away again. This time, he drove to a faraway town. On the way, he could hear the dog crying in the bag. Upon arriving, he opened the bag and saw the bag was filled with blood that had flowed out of the dogÂ’s mouth. Prying the dogÂ’s mouth open, he discovered that its tongue was torn in two. The dog had bitten its own tongue in half to kill itself.<br><br>We both fell silent. From the rearview mirror, I could see the driverÂ’s eyes filled with tears. After a while he said, "Every time I see a dog, it reminds me of my German shepherd. I know I will be in pain for the rest of my life. I really do not live up to being a human being. Dogs are more human than I am."<br><br>As I listened to the taxi driver tell his story, a scene entered my mind: the German shepherd was running tirelessly through the meadows, the mountains, the fields, the towns and the cities. In order to find his master, he ran hundreds of miles and suffered a great deal until finally, he arrived at his masterÂ’s house. He never thought that his master would not only refuse to open the door for him without saying a word of comfort, but would take him far way to discard him again. What a shock this is to a loyal and courageous dog!<br><br>The taxi driver continued on saying that afterward, he buried the dog with a grand funeral. In memory of the dog, he went to the gravesite often. Unfortunately, this did not ease his feelings of guilt. So he had sworn that he would tell this story to every dog owner he met, hoping to alleviate his feelings of guilt.</div>

The dog had bitten its own tongue in half to kill itself.<br><br>We both fell silent. From the rearview mirror, I could see the driverÂ’s eyes filled with tears. After a while he said, "Every time I see a dog, it reminds me of my German shepherd. I know I will be in pain for the rest of my life. I really do not live up to being a human being. Dogs are more human than I am."<br><br>As I listened to the taxi driver tell his story, a scene entered my mind: the German shepherd was running tirelessly through the meadows, the mountains, the fields, the towns and the cities. In order to find his master, he ran hundreds of miles and suffered a great deal until finally, he arrived at his masterÂ’s house. He never thought that his master would not only refuse to open the door for him without saying a word of comfort, but would take him far way to discard him again. What a shock this is to a loyal and courageous dog!<br><br>The taxi driver continued on saying that afterward, he buried the dog with a grand funeral. In memory of the dog, he went to the gravesite often. Unfortunately, this did not ease his feelings of guilt. So he had sworn that he would tell this story to every dog owner he met, hoping to alleviate his feelings of guilt.</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> WHY THE FCuk HE WANT TO DUMP THE DOG?!<br>FIND THE DOG A NEW OWNER WAD!!!!!<br>KNN AS IF THE DOG CAN SURVIVE BY ITSELF IN THE HIILS OR MOUNTAINS...<br>&amp;^%$#...TELL THE UNCLE DUN TOK COK LAR!!</div>
