Stop hao-lianing around with your $5000++ salary, ur tiny red car where u got even though you live 5 steps away from the school. Jus so that u can honk at poor toot students who have their shirt/blouse out and show them your pathetic car. Stop telling ppl u are the future HOD jus because you won an award from where? London isit? Saw ur crappy face with 2 dumb blondes in the school mag. Think, if jus by putting ur useless notes on ur lousy projector to let students copy while u haf ur hao-lianing session u can win an award?! Pui! No wonder Chemistry was so badly done in the 'O's. Stop pointing those fingers of urs around, as though u are so clever. Din your mum told you? Its rude.Oops. I forgot. U showed off your mum passed away becos of smoking isit? Oh, now I understand why u do some things u do. Single parent. Understandable. Stop flirting around with the school gals as well. We know u are desperate. Jus look at ur height.  Dun tell students how late u work till, we dun care. Since u like to play superhero and be involved in everything that doesn't concern you, stop whining like a gal. Do not suck up to ur buddy tooot ( principal) and get extra funding for ur 'yawn' shooting. Wat? Air con bus transport twice/thrice weekly! How much funds you have! Did I hear about you boasting an air-con range in tooot!? What the heck! Waste of school resources! I know you claim your 'fren' gets drunk easily after nites out and u are the one who carries him home. We all know. 'Fren' is actually u. Stop acting.Pathetic. Stop treating students like babies. Even other teachers say the same. For once, can you PLEASE MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS and KEEP YOUR ADVICE TO YOURSELF? STOP TRYING TO BRING toot DOWN SINCE THE FIRST DAY YOU CAME. SORRY. WE ARE STILL AT THE PINNACLE REGARDLESS OF YOUR BEST EFFORTS.<br><br>Finally, and most importantly, CHOO, as u like to be called, YOU SUCK. SERIOUS.<br><br>So happy i'm not in toot anymore. For the rest of you reading this who are still in toot, just hope u dun see CHOO. Worse still, his form class. Before I forget, dun be confident when he says that the chemistry papers are easy and you all are well-prepared for it, he just wans to make himself seem like a better teacher.<br><br>Grow taller soon.<br>Regards.<br><br>-&gt; toot means censored.
