The shows you list appeal to a great portion of the population, young and old.<br><br>However, the feedback from the industry is that a local animated sitcom will not be succesful because the majority of (adult) Singaporeans feel animation is for kids and these viewers will never accept a Simpsons or Family guy-type show featuring local characters.<br><br>I think the industry feels it would only make sense to make a show if it appeals to the majority of viewers, young and old, all races, lower-, middle- and high-income groups.<br><br>My conviction is that a sitcom that looks like South Park and plays like the Simpsons will get good ratings. I hope to prove it by getting people excited and expressing their interest in seeing made and aired in Singapore.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The reason why south park is a popular series is due to it contents.<br>Its vulgar with tons of fart/sex jokes. Thats why people like it.<br><br>The other reason is that the producer is able to keep up to date and make episodes that revolve around all the latest gossips/news.<br>Examples would be the episode Paris hilton stuff the pineapple into her cheebye, the WoW episode, Chinpokomon, PSP episode when kenny goes to heaven, Wii episode when cartman freeze himself. Blah blah.<br><br>I pretty much watched everything from season 6~10.<br>Some episodes are actually quite sian.<br><br>Singaporeans will only be interested in sitcoms if you can include the latest gossips in sg, politics stuff, ahbeng stuff and all the crude language.<br>But in sg, sure kana ban.<br><br>If you going to revolve around the PCK singlish and lousy sg jokes.<br>Wont appeal i think. Even if it does, only to minority, and is those type of watch and forget show.<br>Got watch nvr watch no diff.</div>

The humour of that show will never be allowed in Singapore and that's okay. I don't want to do the exact same thing. I couldn't even if I wanted too.<br><br>I think that if South Park's humour can be mixed with PCK and Under One Roof's humour, it could  be a funny show that will be allowed and will appeal to you, me and also more conservative people. I think it's worth a try. Just the idea alone is already so different from what's been on offer so far, it'll be exciting to see.</div>
