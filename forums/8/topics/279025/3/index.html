They'll not watch an animated sitcom for adults, especially one that looks like South Park."<br><br>I started this thread for a practical purpose. I can't convince the network to make this show just by telling them Singaporeans want to see it. Singaporeans will have to tell them directly.<br></div></blockquote>I love South Park, The Simpsons, The Family Guy, and Futurama...Only the Simpsons are shown on TV, so for the rest, I bought DVDs from the States.</div>

Southpark humour derives alot it's dialogues plot (very important)/ characters and relevance (this can be disputed for early season).<br><br>The most impressive thing about southpark are it's characters. Every character has a unique, distinct and sometimes, queer, personality. Their personalities are not just for differentiating characters, but also closely tied to the plot of the story. One of the most memorable reflections of Cartman's vengeful personality has to be "Scott Tenorman must die". You can watch it here <a href="http://www.southparkzone.com/episode-vid-501.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.southparkzone.com/episode-vid-501.htm</a>. Point is, characters are important elements and to not develop it fully will only make your film dry and impersonal. Yet from the clips you have shown, the characters are simply tools to relate storylines in your film, they have no importance and will be just as funny if they were replaced with any other character. Yet, Southpark would no longer be Southpark if any of it's character changes (which is why Kenny is always "reborned").<br><br>The next thing is dialogues, Southpark is certainly have very fantastic dialogues . Dialogues are clear, interesting, reflective of personality and most of all, funny. They keep the film interesting even in very dry, and perhaps necessarily dry, times. Dialogues also frequently carry double-meanings and are heavily connotated by influence from various cultures. This makes it an extra perk for those who catch it.

I think it is a great idea, but I feel that this is not easy, and you'll really need to be able to do better than Southpark if you want it to be successful.

Another thing though, South Park may seem like a light-hearted not-to-be-taken-seriously comedy but it actually deals with very serious issues such as homosexuality, racism, etc. Usually at the end of an episode Stan would go into his "I learned something today..." speech. If you look past all the jokes you'll find a very meaningful satire of important global issues. That, in my opinion, is what makes South Park one of the greatest comedies.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Where Is God:</div><div class="quote_body">I think Iskandar has some very wrong conception of southpark.<br><br>Having watched every single episode (yes, do try and quiz me on it), I can tell you that southpark is really more than just redneck-eque sex/gore/racism humour. Southpark humour derives alot it's dialogues plot (very important)/ characters and relevance (this can be disputed for early season).<br><br>The most impressive thing about southpark are it's characters. Every character has a unique, distinct and sometimes, queer, personality. Their personalities are not just for differentiating characters, but also closely tied to the plot of the story. One of the most memorable reflections of Cartman's vengeful personality has to be "Scott Tenorman must die". You can watch it here <a href="http://www.southparkzone.com/episode-vid-501.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.southparkzone.com/episode-vid-501.htm</a>. Point is, characters are important elements and to not develop it fully will only make your film dry and impersonal. Yet from the clips you have shown, the characters are simply tools to relate storylines in your film, they have no importance and will be just as funny if they were replaced with any other character. Yet, Southpark would no longer be Southpark if any of it's character changes (which is why Kenny is always "reborned").<br><br>The next thing is dialogues, Southpark is certainly have very fantastic dialogues . Dialogues are clear, interesting, reflective of personality and most of all, funny. They keep the film interesting even in very dry, and perhaps necessarily dry, times. Dialogues also frequently carry double-meanings and are heavily connotated by influence from various cultures. This makes it an extra perk for those who catch it. To substantiated my point for excellent dialogues, <a href="http://www.southparkzone.com/episode-vid-902.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.southparkzone.com/episode-vid-902.htm</a>.<br><br>Lastly, plots are often beautifully... (I would write more, but i have to eat dinner)<br><br>While you may argue that the style of your directing, tv switching-manner of plot progression, doesn't allow much for any of the above, it may be pertinent that you ask yourself whether it is worth giving up all the above elements for your unique style of directing. I think it's a hit or not situation.<br><br>I can tell that you are trying to emulate the style of southpark while adding your own flavour. I think it is a great idea, but I feel that this is not easy, and you'll really need to be able to do better than Southpark if you want it to be successful. After all, emulations often lead to comparisons.</div></blockquote>All your comments apply to the short I made and the clips from the sketch show. What did you think of the scenes from <a href="http://cartoons.com/animation.htm" rel="nofollow">Circus</a>?</div>

No engaging storyline. No change in beats. Predictable - the boy will obviously get his head bitten by the lion, it's just how bloody and gory and stupid it will be, the reason for which the lion tamer left was stupid too.<br><br>4) I can't believe i spent time lookin through those clips. There was no emotional change. The characters did not go through any change from start to end of each clip. It looked like a school animation project at best.<br><br>5) The child getting his head bitten off by a lion is a just revolting when there is no meaning to it. I don't even know when that scene was there.<br><br>6) Haiz. I don't think it will work. I mean take a look at the simpsons - at least there's logic there. If homer simpson got his head bitten off by a lion, at least it might have been because he dropped a doughnut into the lion's mouth and wanted it back. Or perhaps he wanted to look down the lion's throat. He would probably also have stuck his hand in first, then be stupid and put his head in. At least there's a reason for him to put his head in - you character has no reason whatsoever.<br><br>7) Your characters are just like robots - EVERY ONE OF THEM. They have no depth whatsoever. There appears to be not much difference between each of the characters except for their appearance. All of them have no brains and cannot think at all.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> There is no CONFLICT.<br><br>9) If you haven't taken a scriptwriting class before or some form of film studies, try taking one?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for your nine-point review. I felt it only just to take the time to write a nine-point reply.<br><br>1 Circus was made for and targetted at a global market.

The reason I ask people to view the clips is to see if they like the style and type of humor, and if they would like to see a local animated sitcom that will look and sound like it, but of course with completely different situations and characters.<br><br>2 Thanks. I don't see any problem with the lip-synch.<br><br>3 Three-act structures usually don't show in scenes, only in entire episode.<br><br>4 I appreciate the time you took to look through the clips, and I'm sorry you didn't enjoy them.<br><br>5 The boy's head getting bitten off is about how people who try too hard to have fun often don't worry too much about safety, especialy other people's safety.<br><br>6 The boy's character is not Homer and Circus is not The Simpsons. In your first point you say Circus is an imitation of The Simpsons, now you say it's not enough like The Simpsons. I can't do much with reviews like 'Why isn't it more like The Simpsons?"<br>Again, this scene is about a little boy who is pressured into a very dangerous situation and it doesn't end well. It's not about donuts, and the boy doesn't want to do it in the first place but is pressured into it by the adults.<br><br>7 Maybe you prefer less subtle expression of emotion, more exaggerated inflection and bigger emoting. I don't, and purposely kept everything more low-key. That is not everyone's taste. Some people like over-the-top acting. I think they feel more comfortable with it, so there's no mistaking they're watching a comedy. They can tell from the rising pitch and the laugh track that there's a joke. I prefer subtlety and would like to see a local animated sitcom without a laugh-track or high-pitched exchanges.<br><br>8 This remark is addressed in 7. Just because no one is screaming, it doesn't mean there's no conflict.<br><br>9 No comment.<br><br>Not everyone will like the humor, the animation or the characters. Circus isn't your cup of tea.

It's like "I have a lion here with a big open mouth" "oooo! boy go put your head in" "okay." Head gets bitten off.<br><br>None of the characters are motivated by anything it seems.

I'm referring to the conflict that is present in every story. This is taught as part of the basics of script/screenwriting. Not the conflict as in fighting/screaming at each other. Research a bit on what is meant by conflict in stories for screen.</span><br><br></div></blockquote>In short, I cannot grasp what your premise is, I can't see any beat changes, there is no motivation in the actions of the characters, there is no setup &amp; payoff, there is no conflict (no, not the screaming at each other and fighting kind), etc.</div>
