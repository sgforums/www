            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone,<br><br>I'm Iskander and I make cartoons and animation. In 2000 I saw a show called South Park and thought, "I want to do animation like that!"<br>So, I made some very <a href="http://www.sgcartoons.com/animation.htm" rel="nofollow">rough samples</a>, without sound effects and/or without music.<br><br>I went around town to pitch the idea of an animated sitcom, and the industry feedback was:<br><br>"Singaporeans think animation is for kids. They'll not watch an animated sitcom for adults, especially one that looks like South Park."<br><br>I started this thread for a practical purpose. I can't convince the network to make this show just by telling them Singaporeans want to see it. Singaporeans will have to tell them directly.<br></div>

Homer Simpson is an irresponsible, abusive and violent alcoholic. Yet a very lovable character. Moses Lim or Gurmit Singh can't come home drunk and kick the dog, but an local animated character might.<br><br>I think it's worth a try.<br></div>

In 2000 I saw a show called South Park and thought, "I want to do animation like that!"<br>So, I made some very <a href="http://www.sgcartoons.com/animation.htm" rel="nofollow">rough samples</a>, without sound effects and/or without music.<br><br>I went around town to pitch the idea of an animated sitcom, and the industry feedback was:<br><br>"Singaporeans think animation is for kids. They'll not watch an animated sitcom for adults, especially one that looks like South Park."<br><br>I started this thread for a practical purpose. I can't convince the network to make this show just by telling them Singaporeans want to see it. Singaporeans will have to tell them directly.<br></div></blockquote>as far as i know, south park will not get approval by our ultra conservative government agencies and MDA. so you can forget it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>good attempt, though not too pleasant on the eye....would be nice if you do it 2-d rather than the flat 1-d ...script needs strengthening, off hand i can figure a couple of people who can contribute, make it more comical and satirical.....<br><br>if you can't get it screen then do it via the net...youtube is a good way to start as you've already done, if it's good you'll get cult following and the rest is history....<br><br></div>
