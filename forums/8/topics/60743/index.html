But I can't be myself if I don't want to stick out like a sore thumb. The consequences are not favorable and more problems will arise. Looking at the big picture. It's best to speak Singlish with Singaporeans to save all the trouble. Even when speaking with mainland Chinese folks, my mandarin is drastically diff from what I converse with locals, in terms of intonation, accent, vocabulary word use and articulation. I speak 'Singlish mandarin' with Singaporean Chinese.<br><br></div>
