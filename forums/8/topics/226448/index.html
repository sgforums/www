I did not buy the<br>&gt; &gt; roadbike because the staff serving me could not tell me the difference<br>&gt; &gt; between a $900 bike and a $300 bike except that they were both had<br>&gt; &gt; aluminium frame. I did not buy the fax machine because no one bother<br>to<br>&gt; &gt; serve me despite standing at the fax machine section for 15 mins. I<br>&gt; &gt; approached a staff at the adjacent section selling telephone but all he<br>&gt; &gt; told me was the staff selling fax machine is not around and did not<br>&gt; &gt; offer any assistance.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; On the 21/10/06 I returned to Carrefour - Suntec City - to get a refund<br>&gt; &gt; for the laptop as I had discovered that the laptop only supported<br>&gt; &gt; Windows XP and could not be used to run my DOS programme. The salesman<br>&gt; &gt; who sold me the laptop 6 days earlier was very unhappy and refuses a<br>&gt; &gt; refund of the laptop citing various lame excuses. He finally agree to<br>a<br>&gt; &gt; refund after I went through Carrefour's refund policy with him. At this<br>&gt; &gt; point he make a photocopy of my identity card claiming the company's<br>&gt; &gt; need to track my refund history. I was outrage and disappointed at<br>being<br>&gt; &gt; treated like a criminal and asked for the duty manager. The duty<br>manager<br>&gt; &gt; arrived and agreed that it was not Carrefour's policy to make photocopy<br>&gt; &gt; of customer's IC but he was no better than the salesman for he wanted<br>to<br>&gt; &gt; take down my particular's instead.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; I am very disappointed with the Carrefour's staff, from the lack of<br>&gt; &gt; product knowledge to the lack of service and finally to their staff's<br>&gt; &gt; attitude of negating on the company's promise of a refund if goods<br>were<br>&gt; &gt; returned intact. They should not bother to track my refund history as<br>I<br>&gt; &gt; will not be shopping there anymore.<br>&gt; &gt;<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thomas is really naive to think that Companies actually take time to write different replies to different complaint letters<br><br>If they didn't look into the case, The email would just end after the first Carrefour reply and they wouldn't even care about whether they cc to anyone else or not.<br><br>BTW, Is this Thomas's first time out shopping?</div>

[/b]</blockquote>Maybe you the one who is blind, What I am complaining is Dr is unfair about all his complains, in fact his notebook case is totally non-sense ..... You blind is it ? We talking about the doctor at fault, not talking about template !!!<br><br>So what the staff make a mistake, if a Dr that highly educated and professional also can make mistake of getting a new notebook , without thinking that his software is old dos !!!!   then a more less educated and professional supermarket staff cannot make mistake is it ?<br><br>So doctor can shit , other people cannot is it !!! You are the one that is blind, maybe you should go see that doctor to treat you blindness , I bet he will use a template also to refer you to the mental hospital !!!!<br><br></div>
