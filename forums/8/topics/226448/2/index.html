I did not buy the<br>&gt; &gt; roadbike because the staff serving me could not tell me the difference<br>&gt; &gt; between a $900 bike and a $300 bike except that they were both had<br>&gt; &gt; aluminium frame. I did not buy the fax machine because no one bother<br>to<br>&gt; &gt; serve me despite standing at the fax machine section for 15 mins. I<br>&gt; &gt; approached a staff at the adjacent section selling telephone but all he<br>&gt; &gt; told me was the staff selling fax machine is not around and did not<br>&gt; &gt; offer any assistance.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; On the 21/10/06 I returned to Carrefour - Suntec City - to get a refund<br>&gt; &gt; for the laptop as I had discovered that the laptop only supported<br>&gt; &gt; Windows XP and could not be used to run my DOS programme. The salesman<br>&gt; &gt; who sold me the laptop 6 days earlier was very unhappy and refuses a<br>&gt; &gt; refund of the laptop citing various lame excuses. He finally agree to<br>a<br>&gt; &gt; refund after I went through Carrefour's refund policy with him. At this<br>&gt; &gt; point he make a photocopy of my identity card claiming the company's<br>&gt; &gt; need to track my refund history. I was outrage and disappointed at<br>being<br>&gt; &gt; treated like a criminal and asked for the duty manager. The duty<br>manager<br>&gt; &gt; arrived and agreed that it was not Carrefour's policy to make photocopy<br>&gt; &gt; of customer's IC but he was no better than the salesman for he wanted<br>to<br>&gt; &gt; take down my particular's instead.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; I am very disappointed with the Carrefour's staff, from the lack of<br>&gt; &gt; product knowledge to the lack of service and finally to their staff's<br>&gt; &gt; attitude of negating on the company's promise of a refund if goods<br>were<br>&gt; &gt; returned intact. They should not bother to track my refund history as<br>I<br>&gt; &gt; will not be shopping there anymore.<br>&gt; &gt;<br></div></blockquote>I think Carrefour's main mistake is the email slip-up. For me their service is OK for a hypermart. To understand the saleman's frustration, you should visit Carrefour on a busy day and see how crowded it is. There are so many people asking so many things. An careful consumer should do his homework first, especially for expensive things like a notebook computer, you should never depend entirely on a salesperson.<br><br>It is rather strange that this Dr. Thomas Lee is buying a computer from a hypermart rather than Funan or Sim Lim, or even Best Denki. Maybe he is busy doctor who has no time to shop at all. I think I would also be very frustrated if a customer wants to return a new, perfectly functional notebook because it can't run DOS programs. A simple emulator (like DOSBox) will do, however,  the question remains -<br><br>What kind of important program still runs on DOS nowadays? Why is the doctor so unhappy that he can't run it?<br><br></div>
