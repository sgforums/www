            <div class='col-md body'>October 2003<br><br>Captive dolphins in Singapore finally have a reason to smile thanks to a new campaign launched by WSPA member society, Animal Concerns Research and Education Society (ACRES). ACRES initiated its campaign, "Behind the Dolphin's Smile - A look into the plight of dolphins in captivity," following an intensive investigation into the welfare of the six dolphins currently living in Underwater World Singapore's Dolphin Lagoon.<br><br>The dolphins in the Dolphin Lagoon are part of a marine exhibit including a swim-with-dolphins component. The dolphins used are Indo-Pacific humpbacks and are known for being especially shy and sensitive animals. These introverted dolphins are forced to perform up to four times per day, 365 days a year. One of the exhibit's dolphins, Natam, died in 2001 due to a stress-related illness and concerns are high for the remaining animals.<br><br>"Despite their smiles, the dolphins are suffering," commented ACRES president, Mr. Louis Ng, at a press conference to launch the new campaign. "Enlightened governments around the world agree that it is cruel to keep these free-ranging marine mammals in captivity. Singapore should aim to be #1 in animal welfare too and not just be content with having the world's #1 airport."<br><br>Since its campaign launch in September 2003, ACRES has been working to educate the general public about the plight of captive dolphins by taking their messages on the road and circulating a petition to end the captivity of dolphins at Underwater World Singapore's Dolphin Lagoon. The petition already has over 2,250 signatures, including those of the SPCAs of Hong Kong, Malyasia, India and Nepal.<br><br>In addition to securing the retirement of the six Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins currently living at the Dolphin Lagoon, ACRES' 'Suffering, Not Smiling' campaign aims to:<br><br>Â· End the use of dolphins in animal shows<br>Â· End the petting and swim-with-dolphins sessions<br>Â· End further imports of dolphins to Singapore<br>Â· Stop new dolphinariums from being established in Singapore.<br><br>Underwater World Singapore became one of the first marine parks in Asia to keep Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins in 1999, so it is fitting that this facility be among the first targeted by this campaign. The dolphins owned by Underwater World Singapore were imported from Thailand to fill Dolphin Lagoon's tanks. At the time, the park claimed to have saved these dolphins from ending up on the menu at a restaurant in Thailand. But the evidence suggests something far less atrustic, as the World Conservation Union released a statement saying, "A directed net fishery for Irrawaddy and Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins has developed in Thailand to supply live dolphins to marine parks." (Reeves &amp; Leatherwood).<br><br>Please take a few moments to send a letter of protest to Haw Par Corporation Limited, the owners of Underwater World Singapore and its Dolphin Lagoon. Express your support for ACRES and their campaign to stop dolphin suffering. Politely request that Haw Par discontinues the use of captive dolphins at its facility immediately.<br><br>Mr. Wee Ee Lim<br>President and Chief Executive Officer<br>Haw Par Corporation Limited<br>178 Clemenceau Avenue<br>#08-00 Haw Par Glass Tower<br>Singapore 239926<br><br>Please send a copy of your letter to ACRES at: dolphin@acres.org.sg<br><br>extracted frm - <a href="http://www.freethedolphins.org/singapore_03.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.freethedolphins.org/singapore_03.htm</a><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Wat do u guys tink? im wondering y the lagoon is targetted wile the Zoo has been doing it for more years....</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>DOLPHINS EXPLOITED AND SUFFERING AT DOLPHIN LAGOON, SINGAPORE<br>PRESS RELEASE<br><br>SINGAPORE 12 SEPTEMBER 2003 - The Animal Concerns Research and Education Society (ACRES) expressed serious concerns over the plight of the Indo-Pacific hump-backed dolphins (Sousa chinensis) currently held in captivity at Dolphin Lagoon, by Underwater World Singapore (UWS).<br><br>ACRES, today, launches the Â‘Suffering, not smilingÂ’ campaign, which aims to raise awareness on the plight of dolphins and urge Singaporeans not to support marine parks that keep dolphins in captivity. The campaign is based on scientific and factual evidence that captivity is detrimental to the welfare of dolphins. It proves that research, conservation and education in dolphinariums, have minimal benefits to wild dolphins.<br><br>Although subtle and less visible, the greatest abuse suffered by captive dolphins lies in confinement itself. Dolphins are highly pelagic animals and have large home ranges of about 30-400 square kilometers in the wild. The Dolphin Lagoon in Singapore measures one hectare, this represents only 0.0003 per cent of the dolphinÂ’s natural home range! Clearly, this is detrimental to the welfare of the animals.<br><br>Indeed, recent studies in the United States suggest that an inordinate number of captive dolphins are succumbing to typical stress-related illnesses such as heart attacks and gastric ulcers. It can hardly be sheer coincidence that virtually identical disorders affect millions of human beings forced to endure tedious and repetitive menial work. Natam, the female dolphin at Dolphin Lagoon had similarly died of a stress-related illness. She had succumbed to acute gastritis in 2001.<br><br>Indo-Pacific hump-backed dolphins are also notoriously shy animals. Forcing these shy dolphins to perform unnatural acts and forcing them to participate in contact sessions with humans further compromises their welfare. The unnatural acts during the dolphin shows also contradict earlier statements by UWS stating that the dolphins would not be made to perform tricks "which are unnatural".<br><br>The contact sessions with the dolphins also exposes the participants to possible diseases from the dolphins. The United States National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has acknowledged that the potential exists for transmission of diseases between wild marine mammals and humans. Marine mammals are known to carry pathogens that can infect humans. As NMFS has noted, not only do bites from marine mammals carry a danger of infection, but there are a number of disease agents that are common to both humans and marine mammals and can be transmitted between them.<br><br>Outbreaks of infectious disease reported in dolphins include erysipelas, pasteurellosis, hepatitis, Pseudomonas pseudomallei infection, and systemic mycosis. While there has been no recorded incidence of human-dolphin disease transmission at Dolphin Lagoon, it should be noted that the recent diseases from animals also had no earlier recorded incidences.<br><br>The conservation and research value of keeping these dolphins in captivity is also doubtful. Research conducted on dolphins in captivity does not have the potential to improve the conservation of wild dolphins as the lives of captive animals are artificial. The extensive list of research on captive cetaceans listed in the campaign report provide further compelling evidence of the limited potential of these captive research.<br><br>The limited value of captive studies and the increasing ability to conduct research on wild dolphins all undermine the case for the continued research conducted on captive dolphins. No genuine conservation organisation will deny the fact that conservation in the wild must take precedence over all other programmes.<br><br>Louis Ng, biologist and President of ACRES, said: "Progressive countries have already banned this cruel practice of keeping dolphins in captivity because it is impossible to cater to the needs of dolphins in captivity. They are sea creatures who need wide open spaces and keeping them in container-size lagoon will drive them insane. Natam, the female dolphin at Dolphin Lagoon had already succumbed to a stress-related illness. Jumbo, the male dolphin at Dolphin Lagoon is also showing signs of mental and physical stress. How much more will it take for people to realize that dolphins suffer in captivity and should belong to the vast open seas?"<br><br>Indeed, progressive countries such as the United Kingdom no longer have dolphinariums (since 1993). Similarly, Brazil, Israel, the state of South Carolina in USA and the state of Victoria in Austrailia have also enacted legislation making it illegal to keep marine mammals in captivity.<br><br>There is also a growing movement within the marine park industry to discontinue keeping cetaceans in captivity. The Weymouth Sea Life Park and Marine Sanctuary in United Kingdom states that: "Sea Life is committed to only displaying creatures which can flourish in our environment. Sea Life believes that whales, dolphins... should not be kept in captivity."<br><br>Although there are still many unknowns, there have been a number of dolphin rehabilitation and release that points to this as a viable option for many captive dolphins. It is the view of ACRES that dolphins belong in the wild. ACRES is therefore campaigning for the rehabilitation and release of the dolphins at Dolphin Lagoon, back into the wild. This humane alternative will give these dolphins back their freedom and the lives they truly deserve.<br><br>extracted frm - <a href="http://www.acres.org.sg/campdolphin.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.acres.org.sg/campdolphin.htm</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>IN NEWS<br>The New Paper<br>July 6, 2003 By Calvin Low<br><br>UNDERWATER WORLD'S PINK DOLPHINS: Conservation or exploitation?<br><br>Everyone loves dolphins - those smiling denizens of the deep we associate, through folklore and National Geographic, with sagacity and their carefree ways among the waves.<br><br>But the smile of the captive dolphin - like Underwater World Singapore's (UWS) pink dolphins at the Dolphin Lagoon - also appears to be its curse, for it reveals no pain.<br><br>Not that the nearly 500 paying patrons cared two Sundays ago.<br><br>Before the 3.30pm show, they were more interested in spotting the two females in the still murkiness of the show pen, exclaiming each time a sluggish fin cut the surface in the 34 deg C heat.<br><br>"See over there - there's the dolphin!" exclaimed Madam Shirley Teo, 44, to her three children against the blaring music.<br><br>"So cute!" exclaimed Linda Lim, 11, seated nearby.<br><br>During the show, oohs and aahs greeted the dolphin's "cute" and "clever" antics. No prizes for guessing who won the day: Education or entertainment.<br><br>After Han and Euang's show, it was Jumbo's turn to complete the visitor's afternoon of fun, by presenting himself to be rubbed and touched so those in the paying queue can have their "been there, done that" photograph taken.<br><br>These activities are nothing to scoff at in terms of revenue generated.<br><br>Not at $17.15 per entry and $5 per photo with Jumbo, multiplied by "thousands of visitors a day".<br><br>So who's complaining? Animal welfare groups are. From local groups Animal Concerns Research &amp; Education Society (Acres) and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), to international organizations like the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society (WDCS) and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).<br><br>All are against the commercial exploitation of captive dolphins because of:<br>Â· The cruel confinement of these ocean mammals<br>Â· The conduct of captive research, which is of little, if any, relevance to the conservation of wild dolphins<br>Â· The deprivation of the dolphins' instinct and natural way of life, including loss of their social structure and enforced dependence on humans for food<br>Â· The dangers of human-dolphin contact, including the possible transmission of disease.<br><br>As a result, half of captive dolphins die within the first two years of captivity. Survivors live to five years, according to data from The Marine Connection in the UK. In the wild, the average lifespan is 45 years.<br><br>SIZE MATTERS<br><br>Dolphin Lagoon holds 30 million litres of water. But this is sub-divided into five pens, the smallest being the size of a basketball court.<br><br>Critics argue that this is inadequate for ocean-living dolphins whose individual overlapping home-ranges are between 30 and 400 sq km, according Dr Thomas Jefferson's three-year study of wild Hong Kong Pink dolphins.<br><br>Acres' president Louis Ng cited Swiss dolphin specialist Giorgio Pilleri, who studied dolphins in captivity for 20 years. Professor Pilleri concluded that captivity, coupled with the destruction of the dolphin's sophisticated social structure, causes "psychological disturbance, and neurotic behaviour almost identical to that of humans held in solitary confinement"<br><br>As a result, the UK government closed all dolphinariums there in 1993.<br><br>UWS does not refute charges that its research on its captive dolphins is of little, if any, use to the conservation of pink dolphins in the wild.<br><br>Professor Pilleri, who himself regretted confining dolphins for research concluded: "Keeping dolphins in artificial conditions can do little else than produce artificial scientific results."<br><br>This is because dolphins in captivity lose their natural instincts and their biological cycles, including ovulation, are altered by the artificial conditions in which they live.<br><br>Researchers involved in Dr Jefferson's study of wild pink dolphins in Hong Kong also found - after having collected information like movement patterns and social organsation - that such data could not have been gathered in a captive setting.<br><br>Captive dolphins also present a small genetic pool which severely limits captive breeding programmes.<br><br>To avoid the high risk of in-breeding, such programmes rely on further captures from the wild to replenish dolphinarium stocks.<br><br>Because dolphin tricks have lost their novelty, the captive industry worldwide has moved to "swim with the dolphin" programmes.<br><br>But before you jump in, read the fine print on your indemnity form carefully.<br><br>WDCS and The Humane Society of the US are concerned that the promotion of captive dolphin touching and feeding programmes will encourage the public to repeat their experiences with wild dolphins and whales - which is potentially dangerous.<br><br>In two separate incidents in Florida, people were badly bitten by wild dolphins:<br><br>One needed 20 stitches to her leg, and the other needed emergency room treatment for a deep wound in her hand.<br><br>extracted frm - <a href="http://www.acres.org.sg/newsunderwater_060703.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.acres.org.sg/newsunderwater_060703.htm</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Response from "UNDERWATER WORLD'S PINK DOLPHINS: Conservation or exploitation?" article<br><br>The New Paper<br>16 July 2003<br>SPEAK UP: YOUR FORUM<br><br>Dolphins can thrive in captivity<br><br>I would like to respond to Calvin Low's Jul 6 report on the Underwater World Singapore pink dolphins. The views of the marine park community were not properly represented in the article. Furthermore, there were serious errors. Dolphins do very well in the care of modern marine parks like Underwater World Singapore's Dolphin Lagoon. Contrary to the data presented in the report, studies show dolphins in marine parks live as long as those in the wild. Please visit www.underwaterworld.com.sg.<br><br>With respect to pink dolphins, there have been no long-term scientific studies to accurately determine their average lifespan in the wild or marine parks.However, there was a scientific study in Hong Kong that addressed the survival of infant pink dolphins in the wild during the period from 1994 to 2000. The results were alarming, with only 31 percent of infants surviving their first year of life, and 5 per cent survival to year five.<br><br>Their main threats are habitat degradation, pollution, fisheriescompetition (through entanglement in nets and fisheries removing the dolphin's target species), boat traffic, and hunting for human consumption. The conservation threats are all related to human activities and will only be ameliorated through public awareness and education - areas where Underwater World Singapore plays a significant role.<br><br>We work closely with international dolphin experts and we have attended and presented work at international scientific meetings. We are involved in the rescue and rehabilitation of dozens of marine animals every year, including the rescues and release of pink dolphins in 2002.<br><br>We absolutely refute Mr Low's assertion that Underwater World Singapore's research effort has little conservation benefit.Every day at Dolphin Lagoon, there are people who see dolphins for the first time. We provide a first-hand personal connection with dolphins, a direct living experience of enormous value, especially to children.<br><br>Mr Bruce Mackay<br>Curatorial director<br>Underwater World Singapore<br><br>CALVIN LOW REPLIES<br><br>The facts presented in the report stand without error or misrepresentation as quoted from the various sources, including the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society (www.wdcs.org) and Acres (info@acres.org.sg).<br><br>Marine parks' views have been amply covered in recent press reports which failed to address the welfare of captive dolphins.<br><br>In my report, the dolphins' cramped conditions and photographic evidence of their unnatural circus acts at Dolphin Lagoon were presented to illustrate the findings of dolphin experts who have no vested interest in the commercial exploitation of captive dolphins.<br><br>Mr Louis Ng<br>President<br>Animal Concerns Research and Education Society (Acres)<br><br>Acres is deeply concerned about Underwater World Singapore holding dolphins in captivity.<br><br>Recent studies in the US suggest an inordinate number of captive dolphins are succumbing to stress-related illnesses such as heart attacks and gastric ulcers. Natam, the female dolphin at Underwater World Singapore, died of acute gastritis (The Straits Times, Mar 23, 2001).<br><br>The contact sessions between dolphins and humans are also highly questionable. The Hong Kong dolphin watching code states do not touch or swim with marine animals.<br><br>extracted frm - <a href="http://www.acres.org.sg/newsunderwater_060703_resp.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.acres.org.sg/newsunderwater_060703_resp.htm</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I know a way comfirm good for both... open the gates and see if the dolphins come back to work. u they "volunteered" to do so, everyone wil be happy.<br><br>sometimes i hate this type of stupid issues. why not release all the dogs and cats? what is the theory? only endangered animals are looked into? and over-populated animal to be exterminated to an acceptable population(eg. cats)? well if thats the case, then the humans are serious over populated.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bauhahaha... some people always think theay know what's best for them wild animals...<br><br>The truth of the matter is, which PETA advocates letting all animals run wild and free, some animals are equally, if not more miserable out there in the wild then in capavity. Being in the wild brings with it its whole new set of stresses on the animal. Does anyone seriously think that wild penguins which have to batter -20 degree cold, escape predators and go for long periods without food are more carefree and less stressed then captive zoo penguins?<br><br>The fallacy in their arguments is that releasing these animals, which have been conditioned to human contact, into the wild will be a solution. If anything, the entire thing is far more complex then that.<br><br>Just look at Kieko, the whale which played Willy in Free Willy. Following the movies, there was a large media blitz to free the whale. Releasing the Orca into the wild was far more complex then shown in the movie. Had that whale been released into the wild just like that, it would soon die. After spending millions of dollars on new facilities and programmes to get the whale ready for life in the wild, the entire thing was plagued by costy and unnecessary failure, leading many the wonder if the whale and human was just far better off keeping things in capavity.</div>
