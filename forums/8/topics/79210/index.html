            <div class='col-md body'>"Only in the mysterious equations of love can any real logic be found."<br>A Beautiful Mind<br>"May I ask your name, my lady? Or perhaps angels have no names, only beautiful faces."<br>A KnightÂ’s Tale<br>"If I could ask God one thing, it would be to stop the moon. Stop the moon and make this night and your beauty last forever."<br>A KnightÂ’s Tale<br>"Love has given me wings, so I must fly."<br>A KnightÂ’s Tale<br>"Hope guides me. It is what gets me through the day and especially the night. Hope that after you are gone from my sight, it will not be the last time I look upon you."<br>A KnightÂ’s Tale<br>Â“When I was a kid, my father had this dog that started to get all weak and sickly. He takes it to the vet, he examines it and says a maggot must have laid eggs in the dog's butt. The baby maggots have crawled up, now they've started to grow, and eventually they're gonna eat the dog alive from the inside. He says it should be put to sleep, because it's an old dog anyway. But father won't do it. He takes the dog home, he puts it on the bed, he reaches up into the dog, picking out the maggots with his finger, one by one. It takes him all night, but he gets every last one. That dog outlived my father. That's love, Sam.Â”<br>Addicted To Love<br>"If I do marry, I want it to be for love."<br>Aladdin<br>"I'm gonna love you 'til the day I die."<br>All The Pretty Horses<br>"Love is such a strong word. And if you are going to use it, make sure you know what it means. Cause it hurts to hear and know that you don't mean it."<br>Alone and Restless<br>"I'd rather have you as a friend than not have you in my life at all."<br>American Pie<br>"Is it possible to be in love with someone and not even like them?"<br>American Sweethearts<br>"Whatever you choose, we will always have each other."<br>Anastasia<br>"You make me want to be a better man."<br>As Good As It Gets<br>Â“You will see a lot of things, but they will mean nothing to you, if you lose sight of the thing you love.Â”<br>At First Sight<br>"It's the scariest day of the year. Yet only one thing scares me, that we might never have met."<br>Autumn In New York<br>Â“If there's any kind of magic in this world, it must be in the attempt of understanding someone, sharing something. I know, it's almost impossible to succeed, but . . . who cares, really? The answer must be in the attempt.Â”<br>Before Sunrise<br>"You're my heart. And you know I can't live without my heart."<br>Blow<br>"Your heart is free, have the courage to follow it."<br>Braveheart<br>"I will love you my whole life. You and no other."<br>Braveheart<br>Â“Love won't obey our expectations, its mystery is pure and absolute.Â”<br>Bridges Of Madison County<br>Â“Fate exists but it can only take you so far, because once you're there, it's up to you to make it happen.Â”<br>Can't Hardly Wait<br>"Love itself is what is left over after being in love has burned away."<br>Captain Corelli's Mandolin<br>"When you fall in love it is a temporary madness. It erupts like an earthquake and then it subsides. And when it subsides, you have to work out whether your roots have become so entwined together that it is inconceivable that you should ever part."<br>Captain Corelli's Mandolin<br>Â“Kiss me. Kiss me as if it were the last time.Â”<br>Casablanca<br>Â“I would rather have had one breath of her hair, one kiss from her mouth, one touch of her hand, than eternity without it. One.Â”<br>City Of Angels<br>Â“When they ask me what I liked best, I'll tell them it was you."<br>City Of Angels<br>Â“I believe there's a place where the restless souls wander, burdened by the weight of their own sadness. They wait for a chance to set the wrong things right. Only then can they be reunited with the ones they love. Sometimes, a crow shows them the way; because sometimes, love is stronger than death.Â”<br>City Of Angels<br>"Some things are true whether you believe in them or not."<br>City Of Angels<br>"Love gives you wings."<br>Conspiracy Theory<br>Â“There are millions of people in this world, but in the end, it all comes down to one.Â”<br>Crazy/Beautiful<br>"I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side, as a condemned soul, than enter heaven without you. Because of your love, I will never be a lonely spirit."<br>Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon<br>"Poetry, beauty, romance, love: these are what we stay alive for."<br>Dead Poet's Society<br>"If you die, I'll hold your hand. And the last person you'll see would be me. Because I love you. I love you Victor."<br>Dying Young<br>"I kneel before you not as a prince, but as a man in love."<br>Ever After: A Cinderella Story<br>"A life without love, is no life at all."<br>Ever After: A Cinderella Story<br>"Love's not only blind, itÂ’s deaf as well."<br>Excalibur<br>Â“You will be doing anything for the one you love... Except love them again.Â”<br>Faithful<br>"I give my smile to everyone, but I give my heart to only one."<br>Fifth Element<br>"You have been trying to tell me that death is not the endÂ… donÂ’t back out on me, now that I finally believeÂ… I love you."<br>Final Fantasy<br>Â“You mean ... you mean you don't like me?Â”Â…Â… Â“No, of course I like you. It's because I like you I don't want to be with you. It's a complicated emotion.Â”<br>Finding Nemo (Marlin answering DoryÂ’s question)<br>"I take the good with the bad. I can't love people in slices."<br>First Knight<br>"A man who fears nothing is a man who loves nothing. And if that is so, then what joy is there in your life?"<br>First Knight<br>"Love has many faces. I may look on you differently, but not with less love."<br>First Knight<br>"There was once a man that loved you too much to change you."<br>First Knight<br>Â“You are what I never knew I always wanted.Â”<br>Fools Rush In<br>"You will never know love unless you surrender to it."<br>Fools Rush In<br>"I love you so much it hurts."<br>Fools Rush In<br>Â“I always thought that there was this one perfect person for everybody in the world, you know, and when you found that person the rest of the world kind of magically faded away, and, you know, the two of you would just be inside this kind of protective bubble, but there is no bubble, I mean if there is you have to make it, I just think life is more than a series of moments, you know, we can make choices, and we can choose to protect the people we love, and that's what makes us who we are and those are the real memories.Â”<br>Forces of Nature<br>Â“When you love someone, and you love them with your heart, it never disappears when you're apart. And when you love someone and you've done all you can do, you set them free, and if that love was true.... when you love someone it will all come back to youÂ…Â”<br>Forget Paris<br>"I may not be a smart man, but I know what love is."<br>Forrest Gump<br>Â“A heart can be broken; but it keeps beating just the same.Â”<br>Fried Green Tomatoes<br>Â“I wonder how many people never get the one they want, but end up with the one they're supposed to have.Â”<br>Fried Green Tomatoes<br>Â“Sometimes I wish I had never met you. Because then I could go to sleep at night not knowing there was someone like you out there.Â”<br>Good Will Hunting<br>"If I asked you about love, you'd probably quote me a sonnet. But you've never looked at a woman and been totally vulnerable, known someone that could level you with her eyes. Feeling like God put an angel on Earth just for you, who could rescue you from the depths of Hell. And you wouldn't know what it's like to be her angel. To have that love for her, be there forever, through anything, through cancer."<br>Good Will Hunting<br>Â“Real loss only occurs when you've loved something more than you love yourself.Â”<br>Good Will Hunting<br>"Everything I do, I do it for you. Anything that might be special in meÂ… is you."<br>Great Expectations<br>"I am what you have made me to be."<br>Great Expectations<br>"She'll only break your heart, itÂ’s a fact. And even though I warn you, even though I guarantee you that the girl will only hurt you terribly, you'll still pursue her. Ain't love grand?"<br>Great Expectations<br>"I've loved people before and they went away. So a long time ago I made a decision that I wasn't gonna need anybody anymore. I wasted most of my life that way. And I know I'm late and I know I don't deserve it, I need youÂ… I love you."<br>Heart and Soul<br>"Some people live their whole life and never fall in love. I lived mine and I fell in love."<br>Here On Earth<br>"I love this spot. It's like heaven. Right here on earth. Maybe that's what heaven is. Maybe we go through life collecting people and places we love, and they become our heaven."<br>Here on Earth<br>"You know that place between sleep and awake, the place where you can still remember dreaming? That's where I'll always love you. That's where I'll be waiting."<br>Hook<br>Â“All you need is love.Â”<br>I Am Sam<br>"If you can't fall in love with your best friend, then who can you fall in love with?"<br>I Think I Do<br>"I was just about to tell you. That I love him. I do! I love him and I don't care what you think. I love him for the man he wants to be and I love him for the man he almost is. I love him, Laurel, I love him. I love him!"<br>Jerry Maguire<br>"True love cannot be found where it does not truly exist, nor can it be hidden where it truly does."<br>Kissing A Fool<br>Â“How come we don't always know when love begins, but we always know when it ends?Â”<br>L.A. Story<br>"I've loved you from the moment I first laid eyes on you. What would be more reasonable than to marry you?"<br>Little Women<br>Â“Whenever I get gloomy with the state of the world, I think of the arrivals gate at Heathrow Airport. General opinion's starting to make out that we live in a world of hatred and greed, but I don't see that. It seems to me that love is everywhere. Often it's not particularly dignified or newsworthy, but it's always there - fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, husbands and wives, boyfriends, girlfriends, old friends. When the planes hit the twin towers, as far as I know none of the phone calls from the people on board were messages of hate or revenge - they were all messages of love. And if you look for it, I've got a sneaking suspicion that love actually is all around.Â”<br>Love Actually<br>Â“Tell her that you love her. You've got nothing to lose, and you'll always regret it if you don't.Â”<br>Love Actually<br>Â“True love lasts a lifetime.Â”<br>Love Actually<br>Â“Beautiful Aurelia, I've come here with a view of asking you to marriage me. I know I seems an insane person - because I hardly knows you - but sometimes things are so transparency, they don't need evidential proof. And I will inhabit here, or you can inhabit with me in England.Â”<br>Love Actually<br>Â“I love you even when you're sick and look disgusting.Â”<br>Love Actually<br>Â“To love is to suffer. To avoid suffering, one must not love; but then one suffers from not loving. Therefore, to love is to suffer, not to love is to suffer, to suffer is to suffer. To be happy is to love; to be happy then is to suffer, but suffering makes one unhappy; therefore to be unhappy one must love or love to suffer or suffer from too much happiness. I hope you're getting this down.Â”<br>Love And Death<br>Â“Love is a minefield, you take a step and get blown to pieces, put yourself back together again and stupidly take another step. I guess thatÂ’s human nature, it hurts so much to be alone that we'd all rather blow-up than be single.Â”<br>Love And Sex<br>Â“The one who loves, waits.Â”<br>Love At Large<br>"Love means never having to say you're sorry."<br>Love Story<br>"I know that to love you is a treason against France. But not to love you is a treason against my heart."<br>Man In The Iron Mask<br>"Take love, multiply it by infinity and take it to the depths of foreverÂ… and you still have only a glimpse of how I feel for you."<br>Meet Joe Black<br>"Love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without. If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with? I say fall head over heels. Find someone you love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back. And how do you find him? Forget your head and listen to your heart."<br>Meet Joe Black<br>"Find someone who you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back. You have to try, because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived."<br>Meet Joe Black<br>"I love you now. I love you always. Susan, thank you for loving me."<br>Meet Joe Black<br>Â“It is at times like this that I know what my purpose is in life. I am here to love you, to hold you in my arms, to protect you. I am here to learn from you and receive your love in return. I am here because there is no other place to be."<br>Message In A Bottle<br>Â“There is a place you can touch a woman that will drive her crazy. Her heart.Â”<br>Milk Money<br>"The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and have that love returned."<br>Moulin Rouge<br>"If I should die this very moment, I wouldn't fear. For I've never known completeness like being here, wrapped in the warmth of you, loving every breath of you. Why live life from dream to dream?"<br>Moulin Rouge<br>Â“Love? Above all things I believe in love. Love is like oxygen. Love is a many-splendored thing, love lifts us up where we belong, all you need is love.Â”<br>Moulin Rouge<br>Â“All my life, you've made me believe I was worth only what someone would pay for me. But Christian loves me. He loves me, Harold. He loves me, and that is worth everything.Â”<br>Moulin Rouge<br>Â“Come what may, I'll love you till my dying day.Â”<br>Moulin Rouge<br>Â“Can't fall in love? But a life without love, that's terrible.Â”<br>Moulin Rouge<br>Â“If you love someone you say it, you say it right then, out loud. Otherwise the moment just... passes you by...Â”<br>My Best Friend's Wedding<br>"Michael, I love you. I've loved you for nine years. I've just been too arrogant and scared to realize it. And, well, now I'm just scared. So, I realize this comes at a very inappropriate time but I really have this gigantic favor to ask of you. Choose me. Marry me. Let me make you happy."<br>My Best Friend's Wedding<br>Â“School is still the same.. there's still that one guy that you get up and go to school for in the morning. The one with the mysterious confidence that every girl falls for. Those years of school wouldn't have been the same without him. I wouldn't have been the same without him.Â”<br>Never Been Kissed<br>Â“You know, that moment when you kiss someone and everything around you becomes hazy. And the only thing in focus is you and that person. And you realize that that person is the only person that you're supposed to kiss for the rest of your life. And for one moment you get this gift. And you want to laugh and you want to cry because you feel so lucky that you found it and so scared that it will go away all at the same time.Â”<br>Never Been Kissed<br>Â“Don't forget. I'm just a girl standing in front of a boy...asking him to love her."<br>Notting Hill<br>"I was born to kiss you."<br>Only You<br>Â“I love you without knowing how, why, or even from where.Â”<br>Patch Adams<br>"Evelyn, loving you kept me alive. I should have died over there. When I was in that water, I made a deal with God. I told him I was sorry. I was a fool for leavin' you and I told him I would never ask for anything again if I could just see you. And you know what? It was worth it. You kept me alive Evelyn, you brought me home. So I'm gonna stand by my end of the deal, I'm gonna walk away. And I won't ask you for anything."<br>Pearl Harbor<br>"If I had one more night to live, I would want to spend it with you."<br>Pearl Harbor<br>Â“Will you love me for the rest of my life?Â”Â…Â… Â“No, I'll love you for the rest of mine.Â”<br>Phenomenon<br>"Do you ever put your arms out and just spin and spin and spin? Well, that's what love is like. Everything inside of you tells you to stop before you fall, but you just keep going."<br>Practical Magic<br>Â“Look, I guarantee there'll be tough times. I guarantee that at some time, one or both of us is gonna want to get out of this thing. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life, because I know, in my heart, you're the only one for me.Â”<br>Runaway Bride<br>Â“That's why they call them crushes. If they were easy, they'd call them something else.Â”<br>Sixteen Candles<br>Â“I hate the way you talk to me, and the way you cut your hair. I hate the way you drive my car. I hate it when you stare. I hate your big dumb combat boots, and the way you read my mind. I hate you so much it makes me sick; it even makes me rhyme. I hate it, I hate the way you're always right. I hate it when you lie. I hate it when you make me laugh, even worse when you make me cry. I hate it that you're not around, and the fact that you didn't call. But mostly I hate the way I don't hate you. Not even close, not even a little bit, not even at all.Â”<br>Ten Things I Hate About You<br>"Don't let anyone ever make you feel like you don't deserve what you want. Go for it"<br>Ten Things I Hate About You<br>Â“You'll always know when the right person walks into your life.Â”<br>The Butcher's Wife<br>Â“If he's the right man for you, you can't just let him slip on by.Â”<br>The Butcher's Wife<br>"If the people we love are stolen from us, the way to have them live on is to never stop loving them. Buildings burn. People die. But real love lives forever."<br>The Crow<br>Â“DonÂ’t say we aren't right for each other, the way I see it isÂ… We aren't right for anyone else.Â”<br>The Cutting Edge<br>"Love doesn't end just because we don't see each other anymore."<br>The End Of The Affair<br>Â“You see I never stopped loving you, even though I couldn't see you.Â”<br>The End Of The Affair<br>"Let your heart guide you. It whispers so listen carefully."<br>The Land Before Time<br>"I will find you. No matter how long it will take, no matter how far."<br>The Last Of The Mohicans<br>"What will I give to live where you are? What would I pay to stay here beside you? What will I do to see you smiling at me?"<br>The Little Mermaid<br>Â“The only wrong thing would be to deny what your heart truly feels.Â”<br>The Mask Of Zorro<br>Â“I have to ask you a question. It's a good one so think about it. If two people love each other, but they just can't seem to get it together, when do you get to that point of enough is enough?Â”Â…Â… Â“Never.Â”<br>The Mexican (Jerry answering SamanthaÂ’s question)<br>"I got a woman who I can't stand to be two feet away from."<br>The Perfect Storm<br>"I love you from the first time I saw you. I love you now. I love you forever. There is not goodbye - only love."<br>The Perfect Storm<br>Â“Hear this now: I will always come for you.Â”Â…Â… Â“But how can you be sure?Â”Â…Â… Â“This is true love -- you think this happens every day?Â”<br>The Princess Bride<br>Â“Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.Â”<br>The Princess Bride<br>Â“He was like an angel, you know? I never knew life could be like that. He was the one thing I followed through in my life, the one thing I didn't give up on. I was good at loving him.Â”<br>The Untamed Heart (Caroline)<br>"Did you ever think about that night at the park? I barely know you. I don't know your dad's first name, I don't know if you ever wore braces, or contacts, or glasses. Heck I never get the idea how you become a wedding planner. But I know the curves of your face. I know every flick of gold in your eyes. And I know that that night at the park was the best time I have ever had."<br>The Wedding Planner<br>"I know I never done the right thing, I never said the right thing, and I act like a fool. I always say that we'll be just buddy-buddy friends, but I will not be true to my heart. So I ask you this one question. And if your answer is no, I will leave you alone once and for all. Be my wife Mary. And I'll take care of you, be true to you, and like this house I built for your dolls, I will provide a strong roof over your head. If your answer is yes, then no one will ever love you as much as I love you. If your answer is yes, you will make me the happiest man on the earth."<br>The Wedding Planner<br>Â“All our young lives we search for someone to love, someone to make us complete. We choose partners and change partners. We dance to a song of heartbreak and hope, all the while wondering if somewhere, somehow, someone perfect is searching for us.Â”<br>The Wonder Years<br>Â“This is crazy.Â” Â…Â… Â“I know. It doesn't make any sense. That's why I trust it.Â”<br>Titanic<br>Â“I love that you get cold when it is 71 degrees out. I love that it takes you an hour and a half to order a sandwich. I love that you get a little crinkle in your nose when you're looking at me like I'm nuts. I love that after I spend day with you, I can still smell your perfume on my clothes. And I love that you are the last person I want to talk to before I go to sleep at night. And it's not because I'm lonely, and it's not because it's New Year's Eve. I came here tonight because when you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible.Â”<br>When Harry Met Sally<br>Â“You can't express every feeling that you have every moment that you have them.Â”<br>When Harry Met Sally<br>Â“When you realise you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible.Â”<br>When Harry Met Sally<br>Â“Hearts will never be practical until they are made unbreakable...Â”<br>Wizard of Oz<br>Â“Without a heart I can never really know what it would be like to love someone, or ever really understand trashy novels.Â”<br>Wizard of Oz<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
