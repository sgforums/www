              <p>lionnoisy, you are very noisy for nothing.</p>
              <p>Please find out the right facts before posting this crap.    I know Principal from childcare and also have relative working as childcare teacher.</p>
              <p>The toddlers stand when they are having their shower.   No child sits down when showering.      </p>
              <p>Oh yes, the job of childcare teachers is a very difficult and demanding one.   I almost want to  become one but after I found out the job, I give up.       For the younger ones, either the cleaner aunties or the childcare teachers  bathe them .   also teachjers have to clean up their shit like when they pass motion, vomit, pass urine out of the toilets.     Also, parents sometimes are overly demanding.   Was told that sometimes the older ones also stand up pass urine without going to the toilets.</p>
              <p>The pay is very low.    Some kids are beyond control, they give the teachers problems everyday.     </p>
              <p>In chinese it is said this job is ci li bu tao hao.</p>

              <p>MCYS is very strict towards the management of the childcare centres especially those under the government.     They go check it out more than two times a year.     </p>
              <p>lionnoisy, think you are referring to australia childcare centres.      You gotta be in Singapore to know how the childcare centres function, no point posting crap.     </p>

                  <p> Any people would know that he is talk non-sense - who in the right mind would have mattress in the bathroom !!!  if he cannot even know the different between mat &amp; mattress !!! i think Lionnoisy need to go back to childcare to relearn !!!</p>
                  <p> stop asking so much - if you so picky take care of your own child !!! Nowaday, govt &amp; parents over demand on childcare, tons of paperwork, certification - which pay the staff peanuts !!!  yet they do not want to pay !!! Yep soon no one want to work in childcare !!! </p>

              <p>first thing is Pervert Alert !!! Lionnoisy - what the hell is he
              looking at children bathing !!!!</p>
              <p>Any people would know that he is talk non-sense - who in the
              right mind would have mattress in the bathroom !!! if he cannot
              even know the different between mat &amp; mattress !!! i think
              Lionnoisy need to go back to childcare to relearn !!!</p>
              <p>stop asking so much - if you so picky take care of your own
              child !!! Nowaday, govt &amp; parents over demand on childcare,
              tons of paperwork, certification - which pay the staff peanuts !!!
              yet they do not want to pay !!! Yep soon no one want to work in
              childcare !!!</p>
