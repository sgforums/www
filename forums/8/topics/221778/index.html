Is God becoming of your maid? If everyone can have everything, then who will work hard? What would people become and how we know who is good and who is bad? If God clears up all the pollution in the world and cure all the cancer that derived from these pollution, how will people cherish their part of the world and the little things we had, seeing the cancer children the cause of our own hands? What is Justices and fairness when everything want we will have and nothing to contrast to? How boring a place if what we were to be given to us EVERYTHING every single time? What would then people ask for if God has provided every single desire of our hearts. Would we even ask for more and become so intelligent if we weren't even short of food, clothing and shelter? Would we even bother to ask? What will we become if we needn't fight for all what we want and need? There is maybe such a place on earth that existed in such a condition.... In the pig sty where the pigs are waiting to be slaughter....</div></blockquote>If you are serving God for blessings and to make your life easier then ur wrong.  God is not your maid, he is your master.  Learn to serve God with the right frame of mind - do not ask for reward.  The act of service is reward enough.  Even if at the end of the day you go to "hell" so be it.  Go to hell and cleanse it of the Devil for God.</div>
