            <div class='col-md body'>if u get ABD u still got plenty of uni courses in NTU/ NUS open to you i think. ACE will be much tougher, every grade counts. but it still can def get u in quite alot of courses in local uni. as long got A can do something. but also depends on ur GP. ur GP A is a big bonus, other than tt, B and C for GP no diff i think. Fail GP and with ACE will be much worse, maybe can retake GP seperately now i dont know.<br><br>ABD can prob get u in most of the engy courses in NTU and majority of the rest, probably biz also can. for NUS also same. but i dont have any idea of maths prerequisites for either uni.<br><br>when u get ur results u ask around ur classmates u will find out how to register for ur courses in uni. its not tt hard but also cannot suka suka do or worse dont do anything. if u do get AAA i think u will be offered scholarships and such, then dont need to do much, but unfortunately thats not ur case<br><br>can place multiple choices in order of interest, 1, 2 3.. of course most kiasu ppl will just whack all the unis for application and at last min then choose which one to go to.<br><br>then must mail them some documents and transfer them some $$ for their processing. forgot the process exactly already.</div>
