            <div class='col-md body'>Ok....interesting and relevant post for me...so I am replying with my long long posts again Hehehe <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Firstly, how old are you Fat&amp;Ugly ? If you're not above 21 then no need to fret too much, cos most young people tend to be less matured, more shallow when it comes to relationships and are more materialistic too (NOTE I said MOST and not ALL so please don't flame me !).....<br><br>To quote a personal incident, I have also spoken with some irc and icq girls before and then later proceeded to the phone. One of them I managed to get along quite well over the phone (things in common and stuff) and we chatted for quite long hours.<br><br>When I finally agreed to meet her, she said ok and we met at Orchard Cineplex. Imagine my surprise (and frustration) when I was practically ignored the entire night ! She was cold, monosyllabic and didn't even want to glance in  my direction. During the movie, she was unusually silent and straight after the show, cooked up some stupid excuse like "my friend's in hospital I have to visit him now" and left in a hurry ! Needless to say, I never saw her or heard from her again !<br><br>The point here is.....obviously that girl must have been looking for some gorgeous hunk or good looking stud or whatever, cos I don't fit into such categories. I would say I count as the more guy-next-door types, who dresses decently and has a ready smile. Guess that kind of thing isn't enough for some girls !<br><br>So after this long story, the point is that some girls as you have mentioned really DO go for looks. It's just a fact of life...<br><br>I have had other girls talk to me and accept me for who I am physically, mainly because we have been able to get along on an intellectual level. Believe me when I say that this kind of behaviour is more sincere and mature.....liking someone for their emotional qualities and not their physical appearances.<br><br>The important issue here is to socialise more and widen your circle, in order to meet women who can truly appreciate who a guy is INSIDE. Believe me such women do exist but they lie low until they find their right man. SO it is up to the guys to project such an impression (of security, commitment and stability) to attract the girls and I can tell you....looks are definitely secondary for these women.<br><br>Ok ok final note....go for QUALITY in women and not QUANTITY. Go for the SUBSTANCE in people and not just their FORM (now I sound like an accountant hahah  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">)<br><br>Cheers and hope you find the RIGHT woman soon !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi musicwhiz...<br><br>well said ...i must admit i do feel better after i read your mail...thanks a million..<br><br>i guess wat i had to do now is to widen up my circle of friends..but i am quite a shy person and will not initiate conversations unless initiated.<br><br>i do agree that the girls in IRC and ICQ do have quite a high standard in guys when they meet them up. so if they see you that is below their standard, they will kinda ignore you or find some excuse to get away (no offence but this had happened to me and my frens a few times)<br><br>I really guess quality is more important as i wanted a long lasting relationship rather then a short fling.<br><br>thanks musicwhiz again and i do hope you find your dream girl real soon too  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
