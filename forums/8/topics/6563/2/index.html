            <div class='col-md body'>I totally agree with Churra ;0)<br><br>When you go for looks initially, that's lust and not love. Sure looks matter but if you want to love that someone, they have to stand out in everyway possible. In fact, I think love transcend looks. Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. So if you love someone, their beauty will increase by the day.<br><br>My current boyfriend is definitely not a looker. I usually go for really fit lads. And yet, he's the one whom I am absolutely nuts about. In fact, he has been working out just for me =P<br><br>So best of luck to those out there who have yet to find the one and those who have, treasure it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have reply numerous time to this type of topics...and is actually getting tired of this constant lecture....<br><br>I believe that a relationship is split into 2 parts, the attraction and the maintainance.<br><br>During the first stage(attraction), you dun really know much about the other party, so I should say that the main attraction comes from the physical aspects. Thus in this perspective it is almost impposible to judge whether he person is of great character or of high intelligence. But it is this very basic and superficial attraction that makes us wants to know more and get us closer to the other party. And of course you can't just judge beauty in a general sense. Different people have different perspective of beauty, you might be attracted to a really normal looking girl if she have the most beautiful ears. But that is of course if you really like beautiful ears?!?<br><br>But once the first phrase is over, the second pharse(maintainance) begins. At this stage the physical attraction will slowly died away. It might take years, it might just be a week, but it will slowly die off, but while it is dying off, this is where personality comes in. Personality starts to maintain your interests in her/him. And as you get to know more and more about her/him, the physical attraction becomes more and more secondary. If there is not enough personality of the type that you are interested in, you will soon become bored and it will be difficult to maintian your interests in her/him. So I shall say the this is how the beginning of a break up starts.<br><br>Thus my verdict, you got to be attractive in some physical sense to attract others to know you. But if you have a rotten character you can forget about keeping the relatioship for life.<br><br>But there is one more element which a lot of them often miss out...confidence....A confident man is a charming one....a man can be a great looker...but if he lacks confidence, he is just another guy on the street...he would not be able to flaunt his assets....but an average looking guy with confidence, can make a big difference, he would be able to drawn charms from his character and materalise it. This is the charms of a confident man. Of course when I meant confident I do not mean arrogance. They are 2 different thing. I do not think I would need to explain.<br><br>Also woman goes alot by instinct. This cannot be expalin....hmmm....or simply put...an X factor can just attract them....and X means you do not know what. Understand? *sigh* how to since you do not know? So the solution is just be who you are...the right one would come along to pick you up.<br><br>Patie:<br><br>hmmm...so what monastary are you going to? wahahaha....Shaolin temple? Wait till my buaya days are over and I 'll join you.*laffs*<br><br>Canto:<br>*sigh* Confidence......<br><br>------------------<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Just my $0.02 + $0.03(from Lex) worth</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>FatNUgly ah, dun worry too much.. i'm also in ur predicament but as i've found out, it pays to stop wallowing and start taking an active approach to it. U have to bring urself to talk to the girls u meet, have a sincere conversation... even flirt abit, sometimes such an attitude would be interpreted as self-confidence which belies ur outward appearance. Funny thing is, i'm getting some female attention now despite being horizontally and aesthetically challenged; its a self fulfilling prophecy actually, act confident, feel confident and u will be confident, it helps to enhance ur desirable character traits.<br><br>cheers  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pple who are good looking has their problems.<br><br>When pple are after them, it is really difficult for them(the gd lookers) to know if they(the hunters) are attracted to their(gd lookers) looks/body or their(gd lookers) character.<br><br>Btw, when i see a pretty ger, i will take a second look. It is just normal. When I see a Ferrari on the street, I will take a second too .... But to me, that ger is "just another pretty face".<br><br>Woman with confidence really attracts me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Just have confidence in yourself. You are the BEST, in your own ways.<br><br>There is this phrase which an old man in China (Yunnan) once told me :<br><br>"When you look at a beautiful ger for 3 days, you'll see her ugly side. When you look at an ugly ger for 3 days, you'll see her beautiful side" This applies for guys as well.<br><br>Moreover, if a ger is attracted to you just becos you are a gd looker, then she might leave you when she has found another better looking one !!

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, it does not matter whether you are smart or stupid, ugly or handsome, egotistic or not, nice or being jerk, at the end of the day, it voiced down to what I called X-factor.. Women just go for guys who have "chemistry".. And the list that they create are all rubbish... You can fulfil their conditions 1-10 on their list, but miss the eleventh condition called chemistry...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, pacman,<br><br>Well, I think it is a product of both. You know, like some gals who are sweet and nice, you thought they would go for someone who is financially secure and nice, but they chose to go for guys who smoke, have long hair or drive a motorbike. They would tell you that the guy is sweet, no matter how you would see it in from your perspective.. There is nothing which you can do but to blame that you have no chemistry.<br></div>
