            <div class='col-md body'>Every February, across the country, candy, flowers, and gifts are exchanged between loved ones, all in the name of St. Valentine. But who is this mysterious saint and why do we celebrate this holiday? The history of Valentine's Day -- and its patron saint -- is shrouded in mystery. But we do know that February has long been a month of romance. St. Valentine's Day, as we know it today, contains vestiges of both Christian and ancient Roman tradition. So, who was Saint Valentine and how did he become associated with this ancient rite? Today, the Catholic Church recognizes at least three different saints named Valentine or Valentinus, all of whom were martyred.<br><br>One legend contends that Valentine was a priest who served during the third century in Rome. When Emperor Claudius II decided that single men made better soldiers than those with wives and families, he outlawed marriage for young men -- his crop of potential soldiers. Valentine, realizing the injustice of the decree, defied Claudius and continued to perform marriages for young lovers in secret. When Valentine's actions were discovered, Claudius ordered that he be put to death.<br><br>Other stories suggest that Valentine may have been killed for attempting to help Christians escape harsh Roman prisons where they were often beaten and tortured.<br><br>According to one legend, Valentine actually sent the first 'valentine' greeting himself. While in prison, it is believed that Valentine fell in love with a young girl -- who may have been his jailor's daughter -- who visited him during his confinement. Before his death, it is alleged that he wrote her a letter, which he signed 'From your Valentine,' an expression that is still in use today. Although the truth behind the Valentine legends is murky, the stories certainly emphasize his appeal as a sympathetic, heroic, and, most importantly, romantic figure. It's no surprise that by the Middle Ages, Valentine was one of the most popular saints in England and France.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Valentine's Day I know was started by commercial institutions - chocolate manufacturers, card makers, restaurants, department stores, florists, etc.<br><br>I remember years ago, there were even V.Day greeting cards for grandparents, etc.  Totally out of point and meaningless.<br><br>In countries like Korea and Japan, guys give girls chocolates on Valentines, or they go eat some black-coloured noodles.  Then one month after (14 March - I think they call it "white day" or something), girls give guys chocolates back.  Very commercial leh.<br><br>Back in the 1950's when Singapore was poor (I wasn't born then), the Chinese people could afford to dress up and eat good food only during Chinese New Year.  My grandfather used to say that everyday can be Chinese New Year if one has money.  Don't need to wait till CNY to have good food, etc.<br><br>I'm applying this same theory to V.Day.  If one is in love, everyday can be Valentine's.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.tajmahalindia.net/gifs/history-taj-mahal.jpg"><br>For centuries, the Taj Mahal has inspired poets, painters and musicians to try and capture its elusive magic in word, colour and song. It is one of the most flawless architectural creations of the world. Since the 17th century, travellers have crossed continents to come and see this ultimate memorial to love, and few have been unmoved by its incomparable beauty.<br><br>In 1631, Shahjahan went on an expedition to the south and, as always, Mumtaz Mahal accompanied him. But she died in childbirth at Burhanpur. She had borne Shahjahan fourteen children, of whom four sons and three daughters survived. When Mumtaz Mahal died, she was just 39 years old. Shahjahan was inconsolable and contemporary chronicles tell of the royal court mourning for two years. there was no music, no feasting, and no celebration of any kind.<br><br>Tahj Mahal stands in the city of Agra, in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, on the banks of the Yamuna River. It was built in the memory of the beautiful Arjumand Bano Begum, who won the heart of a Mughal prince. She was married at 21 to Emperor Jahangir's third son Prince Khurram and stayed loyally by his side through good times and bad: in the luxurious royal palaces of Agra as well as the transient tents of war camps.<br><br>In AD 1628, Khurram became king after a bloody battle of succession: he took the name Shahjahan or King of the World and showered his beloved begum with the highest titles. She became Mumtaz Mahal, the exalted of the palace and Mumtaz-ul-Zamani, the exalted of the Age. But Mumtaz Mahal was not destined to be queen for long.<br><br>Construction Of The Mausoleum - Taj Mahal<br>Work on the mausoleum began in 1633 and 20,000 workers laboured for 17 years to build it. The most skilled architects, inlay craftsmen, calligraphers, stone-carvers and masons came from all across Indian and lands as distant as Persia and Turkey. The master mason was from Baghdab, an expert in building the double dome from Persia, and an inlay specialist from Delhi.<br><br>Yemen sent agates, the corals came from Arabia, the garnets from Bundelkhand, onyx and amethyst from Persia. Mumtaz Mahal's final resting-place was ornamented like a queen's jewel-box.<br><br>Epitome Of Love -Taj Mahal<br>Shahjahan, who was a passionate builder, now decided to erect a memorial to his queen in pristine marble that the world would never forget. The site selected for the tomb was a garden by the Yamuna river, unshadowed by any other structure. The garden had been laid by Raja Man Singh of Amber and now belonged to his grndson, Raja Jai Singh. By a royal firman, Shahjahan gave Jai Singh four havelis in exchange for the garden. The site was also chosen because it was located on a bend in the river, and so could be seen from Shahjahan's personal palace in Agra Fort, further upstream.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Clinton makes an appeal to protect the Taj<br><br>Neena Haridas in Agra<br><br>It was US President Bill Clinton's greatest wish was to see the Taj Mahal. And so he did today. After spending about two hours in the Taj Mahal, President Clinton walked in to Taj Khema, a property of the UP government 500 yards aways from Taj, to give his 'Green Talk', marking the 30th anniversary of Earth Day.<br><br>Evidently still impressed by the Taj Mahal, Clinton expressed grave concern at the problem of environment pollution that has begun to "mar the walls of the Taj Mahal. Pollution has managed to do what years of war and plundering could not... I understand this is called marble cancer by environmentalists. If this is what pollution can do to a stone, I fear to think of what it will do to our children," said Clinton.<br><br>Clinotn said, "Today is the Earth Day -- but India is a land that has been worshipping its earth and environment for centuries. But it is now time to protect our earth because global warming is a reality."<br><br>India and US celebrated Earth Day today by signing a joint statement of co-operation in the field of energy and environment. US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh signed the agreement a little before Clinton's address.<br><br>Clinton said the objective of the agreement was to exchange ideas and technologies aimed at producing clean and efficient energy without pollution and without disturbing the economic growth of both the nations. Said Clinton, "Under the agreement, the US Agency for International Development has earmarked $ 45 million for projects aimed at producing efficient energy in India, another $ 50 million for clean technology projects throughout south Asia. Besides, the US Exim bank has agreed to make available $ 200 million towards clean technology."<br><br>Clinton's talk against the backdrop of the Taj gains significance because the monument has been facing major environment problems because of leather tanneries in the adjoining areas. Besides, the high flow of tourists and vehicular pollution has also been cause of grave concern.<br><br>Clinton said, "United States has suffered the greatest pollution crises in the world -- one of our rivers caught fire because of the polluted water. We have had acid rains. This is the cost we had to pay for our rapid industrialisation. It has taken us lot of hard work and sustained effort to bring down pollution. It is no more sure that you have to use this kind of energy for economic growth. Economic growth is possible using efficient and clean technology, and that is what our endeavour should be."<br><br>Under the agreement signed between the two countries, India and US will exchange technology of non-conventional energy. India has an edge over other countries in this sector because of the scientific development that it has made in this field. Said Clinton, "You are using electric-run vehicles in and around the Taj. That is a great effort to keep the monument intact. It is this kind of effort that will save the earth from global warming."<br><br>Clinton warned that India is very vulnerable to the bad effects of global warming because of its geographical expanse and rapid economic growth.<br><br>"I am not asking India to overlook its economic concerns, but today we have the technology to make economic growth without eroding the environment."<br><br>A special invitee to the President's talk was Vir Bhadra Mishra, environmentalist and founder of Sankar Mochan Founation and Friends of Ganga. Mishra has been working on cleaning the Ganga, and President Clinton appreciated Mishra saying, "I admire your work on Ganges because, for you, it is a matter of faith and science."<br><br>Ram Prakash Gupta, the chief minister of UP, while welcoming Clinton said, "The Taj is a monument of love and I wish you had brought Mrs Hillary Clinton along with you here," to which Clinton nodded in agreement. Gupta said, "We are working on a $ 150 million project to protect the Taj from environmental protection and I am glad Clinton chose the Taj to address the issue of environment pollution."<br><br>The meeting was also attended by Indian Ambassador to the US Naresh Chandra, US Ambassador to India Richard Celeste and his wife Jaqueline Lundquist, besides a host environmentalists from India and a few school students who, to their joy, got to shake hands with Clinton.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>what great about the Taj:<br><br><strong>The dome is made of white marble, but the tomb is set against the plain across the river and it is this background that works its magic of colours that, through their reflection, change the view of the Taj. The colours change at different hours of the day and during different seasons. Like a jewel, the Taj sparkles in moonlight when the semi-precious stones inlaid into the white marble on the main mausoleum catch the glow of the moon. The Taj is pinkish in the morning, milky white in the evening and golden when the moon shines. These changes, they say, depict the different moods of woman.</strong></div>
