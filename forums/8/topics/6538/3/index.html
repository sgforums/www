            <div class='col-md body'>Well I am an Arsenal Fan...dun sound like one meh...well actually I said before that they will win the title coz of the points system. But whether they will bring back the Euro Cup is another thing..But I guess it will be very tough....Dun really think they are up to it.. if they continue to be complacent. But I must say the free kick by Beckham was not bad...been a long time since he last scored in the premiership?? Well I am not actually a Beckham fan and so I am not too sure...Pls correct me if I am wrong..well btw I hate beckham coz he is damn arrogant...and he is not exactly very fantastic...well I believe that you put him on the other side if the wing and he will be a useless player....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well...if u put Giggs on the right or Rivaldo on the right, they would be pretty useless too.....<br><br>players are meant to play at certain positions. it's been a long time since the late 70s when the Dutch introduced the concept of total football to the world and let's face it, how many players are there in the world today that can play anywhere outfield?<br><br>prediction for Wed. 2-1 to Man U. Giggs rested and Fortune in his place.<br><br>Once Ronny gets back in shape and now Berg is back in form, Man U's defensive problems are ending. Yorke has remembered how to score and Beckham is getting there too. With Keane in the middle and Scholes pushing up, Giggs and Beckham on the flanks and any of the 4 strikers up front, Man U has the firepower to tear any defence to pieces.<br><br>All we need now is for Wimbledon to hold Leeds to a draw and it should be safer for Man U.<br><br>Only Bayern Munich and Barcelona have the team to fight with Man U on their terms.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Altrex (edited 19 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Trapattoni: Please save me, United by John Greechan and Ken Lawrence<br><br>EXCLUSIVE: Embattled Fiorentina coach Giovanni Trapattoni last night put his<br>faith in Manchester United to save his job by refusing to be part of a Champions<br>League stitch-up.<br><br>United are already through to the quarter-finals but a comfortable draw in Valencia tonight would see both teams qualify.<br><br>That would leave the English champions top of their group, the potentially dangerous Fiorentina out of Europe and Trapattoni out of a job.<br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson has left out man of-the-moment Ryan Giggs because of a tight hamstring, yet insists the Welsh winger will be fit to face Bradford on Saturday,<br>giving ammunition to the cynics who suggest United, already without suspended<br>David Beckham, won't be giving their all in the final group match.<br><br>But Trapattoni is confident that professional pride will not allow United simply to<br>cruise.<br><br>'I don't think they would ever sink to such a level,' he said. 'In all these years I have<br>learned something about Sir Alex Ferguson. I know he would never allow his<br>players not to give 110 per cent. He wouldn't stand for that in any game.<br><br>'There is no doubt in my mind that Manchester United will go there to win and that<br>they will play the best team available. They will defend their reputation. It is a team<br>with 11 internationals, one of the greatest clubs in the world.'<br><br>The Fiorentina coach would have gained heart from hearing Sir Alex talk about<br>United's quest for two more pieces of soccer history in Valencia.<br><br>They are already the first club ever to qualify for the quarter-final of the Champions League four times in a row. Tonight, in the Mestalla Stadium, they have the chance to beat a Spanish club on Spanish soil for the first time and also score their 300th goal in European competition.<br><br>United could still lose top spot in Group B if they lose by three goals to Hector<br>Cuper's side and the Old Trafford manager said: 'Tactically, you should never plan<br>just to contain. We will be very positive and we want to win. I would be less than<br>happy if we lost even 1-0, although that would not take us off the top of the group.'<br><br>United trained for only a short time on a pitch so saturated by two days of rain that<br>Slovakian referee Lubos Michel decided to hold a precautionary inspection at<br>breakfast time.<br><br>Ferguson added: 'If the rain continues, we will see a very different type of game<br>than normal in Spain. A wet, greasy surface could make it an extremely exciting<br>match.'<br><br>With Giggs and Beckham out, Ferguson is expected to bring in Quinton Fortune<br>with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer likely to partner Teddy Sheringham in attack.<br><br>do you think Sir Alex will 'give in' and let Fiorentina into the last eight?? personally I dont think so...as I know as a coach himself, he wouldnt allow his player to 'give in'.. he wants them to put in their 100% in every match..that will mean Trappatoni OUT!<br><br>cheerz<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> FNU  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>------------------<br>Yesterday is history<br>Tomorrow will be a mystery</div>
