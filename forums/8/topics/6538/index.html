            <div class='col-md body'>bravo Man U,<br><br>as one of the great Liverpool managers (can't remember which one..)once said, he would rather play badly and win rather than play well and lose.<br><br>Man U, by its own standard, played poorly this season. How on earth they have more points now than at the same time last season is something i really cannot understand.<br><br>Still, no complaints. Just win the Premiership and maybe the Champions League too. Even if you play badly, like in the Champions League final, as long as you win, no one will remember otherwise. Bayern Munich isn't remembered as the team which played better over 85 minutes in May. They are now remembered as the team which lost to Man U.<br><br>Man U forever.</div>

Watch out for the replay in case you missed it..<br><br>Man of the match : Ryan Giggs (my prediction)<br><br>Manchester United now had 12 points and cruise joins Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Chelsea in the last eight who fight for the Champions League trophy!!<br><br>GLORY GLORY MAN UTD!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, Manchester United are through to the final 8 of the Champions League after defeating Fiorentina at OT 3:1 from the goals of Cole, Keane and Yorke.<br><br>Fiorentina started the game quite strong and not surprisingly got their first goal of the match from a superb piece of work by Batistuta. But I can say that if only Schmicheal is there!!! Manchester United got that wake up call and replied with a goal from Andy Cole. With that goal, Andy Cole equalled Denis Law record of 14 goals in Europe. The killer goal came in the 33th min when Roy Keane blasted the ball pass the Fiorentina goal keeper after the ball deflected off the cross-bar from the header of Berg. From then on, the match is all Manchester United's.<br><br>As usual, Ryan Giggs and Roy Keane are the two main engines of the United's midfield with Giggs missed a couple of clear shots of goal.<br><br>According to Kevin Keegan, MOM is Keane that is if you watch ITV in Manchester.<br><br>But I agreed with F&amp;U that MOM should go to Giggs. Athough he missed a couple of clear shots, he is still involved in most of the chances created.<br><br>If he continued playing this way, he could have easily get the Man Utd Player of the Month(again).....!!!<br><br>------------------<br>You've Lost that Lovin' Feeling.....!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i agree with iamsilly<br>i doubt if schmechiel or banks, victor baia or any other great goalkeeper could have stopped the shot<br><br>let's face it, Bosnich is a great shot-stopper, probably the best in the Premiership and a great penalty-saver too. His only problem is that he's a terrible kicker.<br><br>anyway, to fall behind to a goal of such quality from Batistuta is nothing to be ashamed of.<br><br>What Man U fans should really be proud of is the way they came back attacking and Cole's superb turn before scoring. The way they outplayed Fiorentina after being behind to such a great goal<br><br>Glory glory Manchester United. Though prior to this game, I really doubted their ability to retain the Champions League (but not the Premiership), but now i think they have a real fighting chance...if they continue playing like that</div>
