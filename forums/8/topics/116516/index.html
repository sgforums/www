And it's best if you can grad soon and go to work to support your parents.<br><br>Finally got into a poly last yr, due to some reason.. But somehow you wasn't happy at your present school where you never get to take the subs you want and ppl there are dumb and arrogant... You often hear vulgarities in the air within that school, cos the students there believed that it's cool and punk  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> This is something you really don't like and you often rather be alone than to be within the groups. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You saw a new course in another poly.. Something you'd like to do.. And will sure to find ppl of the same interest as you... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Would you choose to try for another poly or stay on? To another poly will waste another yr of your precious youth. Stay on.. I dunno how long you can tahan..

Only child in the family. And it's best if you can grad soon and go to work to support your parents.<br><br>Finally got into a poly last yr, due to some reason.. But somehow you wasn't happy at your present school where you never get to take the subs you want and ppl there are dumb and arrogant... You often hear vulgarities in the air within that school, cos the students there believed that it's cool and punk  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> This is something you really don't like and you often rather be alone than to be within the groups. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You saw a new course in another poly.. Something you'd like to do.. And will sure to find ppl of the same interest as you... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Would you choose to try for another poly or stay on? To another poly will waste another yr of your precious youth. Stay on.. I dunno how long you can tahan.. So?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>Imagine Imagine Imagine.. Put yourself in that situation..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> </div></blockquote>wha tu are saying seems immature and illogical if u ended up in the expected conclusion especially the part of yr enviornment...Well the poly culture isnt that bad afterall....sure u will meet "slackers' but they are everywhere too, in school, workplace ect...i expereinced this sh|t far worse in sec school than in poly....Somehoe in poly ppl are more older and mature so a diff kind of negative environment is going on if there's one...a prelude to working life but in a less immature and individualistic point of view....the best solution is to have your identity, a cool one and reinforce it in front of the others...mabe after a while they may stop bothering u if they happen to...Well as for  e when i was in poly, things were like what u mentioned above, but i didnt let that bother me too musch..AHahaa...i spent most of my time alone going after girls  than this hanging around in groups  sh|t..maybe just a few of them 2or 3 who happen to be like me used hang around but not that much...I guess i discovered the best way to exploit poly life! - The mysterious lonesome Romeo suave and cool!.....you might look around and see groups of ppl hanging about....but in real truth .everyone is "alone"...it doesnt necessarily mean that if u dont belong to a group u are not cool..if this thinking persists in u, u  may end up not enjoying poly life...Its the best time to learn things and about people...watch and learn is the key<br>..And when they enter the wroking life its the same and maybe much more alone than u think....Enter the working world , These ppl aint got time for u pal....</div>
