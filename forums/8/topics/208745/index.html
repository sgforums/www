            <div class='col-md body'>Well, this quiz was given my friend, and he havent tell me the ans to it yet.<br><br>So i thought of sharing it to the ppl here as well<br><br>Here goes:<br><br>You have twelve coins. You know that one is fake. The only thing that distinguishes the fake from the real ones is that its weight is imperceptibly different. You have a perfectly balanced scale that only tells which side weighs more than the other side.<br><br>What is the smallest number of times you must use the scale in order to always find the fake coin?<br><br>Use only the twelve coins themselves and no others, no other weights, no cutting coins, no pencil marks on the scale. etc.<br><br>These are modern coins, so the fake coin is not necessarily lighter.<br><br>Presume the worst case scenario, and don't hope that you will pick the right coin on the first attempt.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>what biangz how many times must explain to those without common sense and never put heart into any situation or bother to sit down and use brain to think.<br><br>12 coins...1 of the 12 is fake and can be identified by been greater or smaller in weight.<br><br>split 12 coins into 2 groups of 6 each...from here on never mix the 2 groups together.<br><br>take first group and split them into 2 groups of 3. weigh.<br><br>1st time:<br>if:-<br>the balance evens out, that means the fake coin is in the other group of 6 coins.<br><br>if:-<br>the balance shows a difference, the fake coin is in this group. thus take note of the location of the difference. (e.g the heavier 3 coins are on the left or right scale plate)<br><br>2nd time:<br>either way you can get to this step even if your 1st time weighing is either result of that mentioned above since you have found which group the fake coin is hiding in.<br><br>if:-<br>now assuming your 1st time the balance evens out, just take any group of 3 coins from the suspect 6 coins and weigh it against any 3 coins of the 6 coins that are genuine and if the balance unevens and you got the 3 coins suspected to contain one fake. even if it balances you will still know where the fake coin is since its definitely with the other group.<br><br>if:-<br>now assuming your 1st time shows a difference, just remove the heavier 3 coins and take note of the position of the lighter 3 coins. you know the remaining 6 coins are genuine and just pick any group of 3 coins from them and place it on the balance. if it balance you know the fake coins are heavier and is the group of 3 coins you just take up from the scale. if it still unbalnce it means the 3 coins remaining on the scale hides a fake cooin and the fake coin is lighter than a genuine one.<br><br>3rd time:<br>either way from step 2 now it should not affect your way to step 3 and you should know which group of 3 coins hide a fake one and if the fake coin is indeed heavier or lighter.<br><br>now assumine you are a lucky star and hit bulls eye, you now take any one genuine coin and weigh it against any one of the suspected from the group of 3 fake coins and find the weight unbalance.<br><br>now assumiming you are down on luck and hit snakes eye you will only get an unbalanced scale on the 3rd coin of the group of 3 coins suspected to hide a fake one then you will take the most 5 times of weighing in total to find the fake coin.<br><br>so please use common sense and think it will take 3x or 5x just to find 1 fake coin in a group of 12 coins by displacing the balance 3 - 5 times.<br></div>

But you do not. So....<br><br>Number the coins 1 through 12.<br><br>1. Weigh coins 1,2,3,4 against coins 5,6,7,8.<br><br>1.1. If they balance, then weigh coins 9 and 10 against coins 11 and 8 (we know from the first weighing that 8 is a good coin).<br><br>1.1.1. If the second weighing also balances, we know coin 12 (the only one not yet weighed) is the counterfeit. The third weighing indicates whether it is heavy or light.<br><br>1.1.2. If (at the second weighing) coins 11 and 8 are heavier than coins 9 and 10, either 11 is heavy or 9 is light or 10 is light. Weigh 9 against 10. If they balance, 11 is heavy. If they don't balance, you know that either 9 or 10 is light, so the top coin is the fake.<br><br>1.1.3 If (at the second weighing) coins 11 and 8 are lighter than coins 9 and 10, either 11 is light or 9 is heavy or 10 is heavy. Weigh 9 against 10. If they balance, 11 is light. If they don't balance, you know that either 9 or 10 is heavy, so the bottom coin is the fake.<br><br>1.2. Now if (at first weighing) the side with coins 5,6,7,8 are heavier than the side with coins 1,2,3,4. This means that either 1,2,3,4 is light or 5,6,7,8 is heavy. Weigh 1,2, and 5 against 3,6, and 9.<br><br>1.2.1. If (when we weigh 1,2, and 5 against 3,6 and 9) they balance, it means that either 7 or 8 is heavy or 4 is light. By weighing 7 and 8 we obtain the answer, because if they balance, then 4 has to be light. If 7 and 8 do not balance, then the heavier coin is the counterfeit.<br><br>1.2.2. If (when we weigh 1,2, and 5 against 3,6 and 9) the right side is heavier, then either 6 is heavy or 1 is light or 2 is light. By weighing 1 against 2 the solution is obtained.<br><br>1.2.3. If (when we weigh 1,2, and 5 against 3, 6 and 9) the right side is lighter, then either 3 is light or 5 is heavy. By weighing 3 against a good coin the solution is easily arrived at.<br><br>1.3 If (at the first weighing) coins 1,2,3,4 are heavier than coins 5,6,7,8 then repeat the previous steps 1.2 through 1.2.3 but switch the numbers of coins 1,2,3,4 with 5,6,7,8.<br><br>LOL LOL!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><a href="http://www.folj.com/puzzles/very-difficult-analytical-puzzles.htm" rel="nofollow">PAISEH HOR!!</a></div></blockquote>Norh, the link is there, click on the word "paiseh hor" is the answer and it's 3 times lol<br><br>btw, it's classified under very difficult segment sia, down there got alot more puzzle, some are really hard, some doable got time then go grind brain abit lor<br>quite fun de</div>
