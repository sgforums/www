Should i stop and rest or i should carry on with life....<br><br>In life, soemhoe we got to wear mask to face different pples especially if our job requires us to meet pples everyday. Only when u reach home can u take off your mask and be yourself.  Did u hear of something like this  b4 " Xi ru ren sheng, Ren sheng ru xi"..Just like chinese opera...the actor and actress are another person when they are on the stage..once they are off the stage they are back to themselves...tht's wht life is all abt...<br><br>i'm also wondering when i can take off my mask and be myself and go after wht i really one... In office....many political ard here adn there...Who's really true to u is really soemthing i wanna find out too... Just being "backstab" somehoe yesterday... didn't really take it to heart...But pples who are softhearted are usually the one who suffer in the end......<br><br>Really tired mentally and physically..don't knoe wht the hell i'm doing noe... Most important when can i take off my mask in life.... I think only when someone see me cry only will they knoe tht's my true self...<br>sadly...i don't knoe how to cry noe........<br><br>Anyway, why are u still here? Shouldn't u be flying off noe?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes, the question is not whether u know who u are or not, coz I feel deep inside, we know just exactly who we are, how we feel. Its just that in the course of expressing this feelings, things get jumbled up a bit, the end result may be a bit garbled, people may misunderstand u, others accuse u of things u aren't... but thats okay as long as u really understand who u are.<br><br>The problem is many at times, we fear if people will accept us if we wear our real faces becoz we have been hiding under false facades for so long. Sometimes its just so much easier to carry on wearing the thin facade we have put on for so long. But, if you can accept yourself as who u are and not give a damn to what pple will say or how they judge you... then I can say u'll have no problems living your life with your masks tucked in your closet.<br><br>Juz some random thoughts.<br><br>------------------<br><strong>Tell me why?<br>I want the meaning of my life....<br>Do I try to live?

            <div class='col-md body'>Never thought of that before.<br><br>Maybe a mask has protective effects. Maybe the mask if for you to blend into certain environments in order not to be found out as a fraud and kanna eaten alive by the nasty things out there.<br><br>On the other hand, I do feel that I tend to change my behaviour in order to fit in into a crowd. Loneliness I guess. Or maybe survival.<br><br>Still, I don't think its that difficult to take down that mask if you want to.

            <div class='col-md body'>Very interesting topic. I think no one person can stand out and claim that she/he has never put on a mask. Everyone wears a mask, the only variation is the period and the intensity. I think masks are there to protect myself and also the people around. Why? To protect myself because I'll feel a sense of vulnerability if I show too much of myself to one particular person. To protect others because I don't really think they want to see the times when I'm raving mad. It's a mean to preserve our sanity.<br><br>There are always periods in my life when I can tangibly feel the mask that I'm wearing. Despite all that might be underneath, I have to put on a facade and face the world as it is. A mask can be so tiresome to wear and it cen bring about bouts of depression.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>To answer what Rinoa has posted, the answer is "no". I don't know the person behind the facade and I think that the mask and the person have been so interlinked that I can't differentiate which is the real me. So, to make my life easier to bear, I see it as the different sides of me. Dependent on my varying moods.<br><br>Hypocrites don't necessarily have to wear a mask to stab you in the back although it's more disgusting if they do. I know from past experience how nauseauting it can be. You see this person who seems so nice or at least civil to you but once your back is turned, out come all the poison.<br><br>"Is it better to live in a world which pleases Mankind or a world which pleases U pleases yourself" (Rinoa). It's difficult to attain the highest level of pleasing yourself over pleasing others especially with the ways most of us are being socialized. I don't know if we'll one day lose our identity but do you know your identity in the first place? I used to worry about changing and losing what I was in the beginning but I've achieved the will to self-delude myself into thinking that I'm changing into a better person.<br><br>Rinoa, I wonder too...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sighz......thanks Rinoa for asking the question i have been asking myself for a long long time......like what they say, we all wear a mask sometime or another.....problem is, for me, i wear a mask all the time.......maybe i've used a mask for too long a period of time, or i have never tried to discover the real me deep down inside, but i find that somehow, i don't know who i am.....sometimes, i look at myself now, look at myself in the past......i've changed, and is still constantly changing due to the environment (maybe) but i think, it's more due to the people around me......i find that my friends are a great influence to me.....i'm not an individual.....(of myself) i am just a replica of all the friends i mix around with, combined. i pick up their habits, their style, and the way they carry themselves.....sometimes, i feel so sick. juz plain sick of myself...the me that i never knew.....<br><br>i may be able to express my feelings well online, but i don't actually do so in real life....which is the real me, i don't know....mayb the one online is the me deep inside, but people will never know. they meet me, they c a great difference......<br><br>sighz........can anyone take off my multi-masks for me???</div>

Telling them how we feel and we are sure nothing serious will happen if we don't knoe them in real life... i heard someone told me long ago tht pples who talked to each other online are pples who are lonely inside..They want pples to listen to them and knoe how they feel...I agreed to this statement to a certain extend...<br><br>i wondering again..hoe are we going to break open the mask everyone is wearing...... tht's will take a long time to do it.......i think...wondering again....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm... what a philosophical question. Must be by Rinoa. *laffs*<br><br>Well, my point of view is rather abstract, hope you all dun mind my $0.02 + $0.03 worth.<br><br>Mask? Do you not wear one? You are always behind a mask, just what the mask is that's different. when you are born, you wear a blank empty mask, you know those without features? Well, after a while as you grow your life experiences is enrich, your mask becomes more colourful, say you got to know that people can betray, then on your mask, you will add a feather of cautious, to put on when you need to help you pass a similiar obstacle. So as more and more patterns goes onto the mask, the more and more different combinations you can have. Abstract?<br><br>Well, what I meant is this, You are born with a mask on, your personality, underneath all that life experience that you gather, is the true mask that you first own, but because of the many addition to your life, you learn how to use these "accesories" to protect yourself. Or sometimes even to gain advantages. Life is a chioce, you can choose to go back to what you are, the inexperience, the unprotected you. But would you? I would not, but then again, I would not use such mask to take advantage of others, it's mine choice, other people can choose otherwise, but they can't decide what I want to do with my life.<br><br>Tired? You aree tired because you are looking at it as a burden. Me? I look at it as experience, I might be laid down by them, but I would take them in my stride, for they are what makes me fight for tommorow.<br><br>Hope I'm not too absract in my explanation, but hope I dun get any flame for this.<br><br>------------------<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Just my $0.02 + $0.03(from Lex) worth</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>interesting topic. i think abt it once in a while and just the other day my colleagues and i were talking abt this. but nothing much came out of it cos i was spending too much time figuring out what mask this particular guy was trying to wear! anyways, just some random thots and ramblings....<br><br>closely tied to the idea of masks is how we want to project ourselves and let others see us. in other words, one's sense of identity and sense of self-worth and pride have a lot to do wif it. i think we are constantly creating ourselves. but this "image-crisis" is strongest when we are in our late teens and early twenties i believe. after that, it may be less a case of us actually discovering ourselves than that we have started to be less concerned with finding an answer. at this point we find ourselves more content with ourselves, with who we are and what we've become. in a way, we make peace with ourselves and learn to be happy with who we are. but here too lies the possibility that we may wake up one morning and, as in some kind of mid-life crisis, wonder whether this is all life was meant to be. but i digress....<br><br>from the replies so far, i think the issue is a complex one, and one that means different things to different ppl. i'll focus on one aspect of it. i think it is necessary to distinguish between putting on a mask because it is part of your work and putting on a mask as a means of self-discovery. here is what i mean. when we are at work, there is an expectation that we carry ourselves in a particular way, that we act a certain way. if this is what you mean by having to put on a mask then, well, there isn't too much there to be said. there are several parts to this issue. on the one hand, we may have to put on a false front in front of bosses or colleagues or customers. but there is another word for that. i believe it's called professionalism. so even when we are crabby or tired or just plain sick of life, we cannot just be ourselves and "heck care everything". just the way life is.<br><br>what i've found to be the best way to get past this "false front" thingey, is to be frens wif ur colleagues and bosses. this of course depends on the culture of the organisation. but if you can be frens, it takes the load off a lot and ppl see you for who you are. being frens allows u to show your vulnerabilities and your concerns. it shows you are human. but then this other side of us may feel that showing our weaknesses would detract from our performance appraisals or would put us in a bad light. so it's a delicate balance between being able to show your "true" self and being (perhaps overly) concerned abt how it will affect our climb up the corporate ladder. suffice to say that a positive result in the case of the latter doesn't always come from a suppression of the former. IF (and that's a big "if") you are the very ambitious type, then you will not find much happiness if there is too great a divide between what u feel is your "true" self and what u think is permissible to let others see abt you (your front). i don't know why, but it seems to me that the more driven a person is, the more he/she will experience a gulf between their true selves and "false" fronts. the successful ones are those who can bridge the gulf. in my view, if ur not very ambitious, then why on earth put up such a front. just be yourself and you'll be much happier. but if u are terribly ambitious, unfortunately impressions (and sometimes only impressions) count a lot. in such a case, "right" impressions matter - and so "fronts" are created.<br><br>on the other hand, the more interesting qns abt "real" and "false" selves are, i feel, whether it makes any sense to say that role-playing, far from being "other" than your true self, is really an essential part of creating your "true" self. we are all caught up in a nexus of expectations and more expectations. do u feel a sense of responsibility to fulfill these expectations (whether from family, society or whatever)? why do you feel this way? because u really believe in something? because u don't want ppl to say things abt you, talk abt you?<br><br>whatever the particular reasons, fronts are put up because of certain expectations we feel we need to fufill. so maybe we should ask ourselves - which of these fronts are really important to us? cos some fronts are there because of who we really want to be. in such cases, masks are the projection of an ideal, something we want to attain. and sometimes (not always) playing a role affects a blurring of the line between "true" and "false" selves. so false fronts may not always be bad. sometimes the tension between true and false selves is transformational - it helps us become who we want to be. because if everything we do has to be "in character", then there is no possibility of great change. doing something out of character, by maybe playing a role, sometimes leads to self-improvement. having said that, i understand the growing pains we get trying to discover ourselves. instead of seeing masks as a bad thing, maybe we could try focussing on those masks we really can't stand wearing. those are the ones we remove, as far as we can. the others help shape and define the kind of person we'll be.<br><br>hmmm....not very organised....but i hope u catch my drift anyways.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
