            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm...due to the amount of "serious" discussions already on this thread, I'd thought I'd avoid hopping on the bandwagon of being too philosophical (as most of what I say would probably be very repetative and redundent anyway) and instead share some experience and observations on it.<br><br>The point I want to make is that different groups of people will always see you differently. My JC classmates see me as an inactive and genrally reserved person; My NS campmates see me as a responsible, fun-loving person; My classmates in the uni see me as a workaholic. And I'm sure the forumites whom I have met have a different impression of me altogether.  But no matter how each group sees me, I'm still me. Its just that I have to act differently in different environments and hence, earning a "mask" from each one. But when you take that down, what lies beneath is still you. I still remember once when I cracked a rather lewed joke in JC, many friends were rather surprised as most thought I was supposed to be the "guai guai" type. So there, my "mask" which had a halo above it suddenly had the halo removed; meaning people now see me differently; closer to my "true self" if you would.<br><br>As for the mask we put on personally, I have to agree its done more as a form of protection (think its been mentioned many times). After all, how can I trust people whom I met not too long with my inner thoughts, inner desires? But this form of protection will still break down eventually anyway, when others know you better.<br><br>That is why I really pity people who take pains to put on a mask to hide many things. Time will be its undoing; in accordance with my belief that truth will come to light one day. And often, this is the case.<br><br>As to finding yourself, I'm afraid I do not have any satisfactory answers here. What I can say is always be true to your ideals and beliefs, because that is the essence of every individual behind the mask.<br><br>------------------<br>I do not embrace my dark side, but I do acknowledge it;<br>else I can never be whole<br><br>[This message has been edited by Bravehart (edited 18 February 2000).]</div>

Depends on the person, situation, time, place, everything!<br><br>I can tell you know, that I myself dislike ppl who puts on a mask, but yet come to think of it, I also have one on...<br><br>Everyone has one on, ask yourself, WHY???  Been thinking about this for some time already, and i think that the reason why I have one on is to protect myself, from what?! From who?!  everything and everyone!  I am not a very confident person, everything can easily trigger me down and hurt me.  Some ppl say that I am naive...(if you really know me that you will know, if you don't then don't bother asking...)<br><br>I hide myself a lot of times.  For instance, I have recently encounter a situtation that I choose to be naive, just knowing the truth will just cause me too much pain and hurt.  I have always told my boyfriends that, if they ever decided to lie to me, pls put in a effort to continue to lie to me, don't ever tell me the truth...

            <div class='col-md body'>I wear maks also....but i dun see them as masks really, althoguh they are.  I would like to consider them more as extensions of different aspects of my personality.  I have a very simple yet complex personality and thus can fit almost anywhere yet nowhere at the same time...hard to beleif until you know me for real...So you will see me with people others would think I would never hang around...mainly because my perosnality is very flexible...notthat i kiss ass or anything, but when i hang out with people and act a certaion way, that is the real me!...I don't have to fake it or make an effort to keep it on.<br><br>The masks that i do keep are when i am sad or angry...my mask is one of bochupness and i pretedn that i don't hurt...tot he point where i actually believe it.<br><br>I beleiev that i talkt to you about this the other day Rino.<br><br>What i project on the net i sthe real me and none oif it is false at all.  at the same time, when you meet me, i am quite different from what you see on the net, but you will also realise that this is also the real me...none of it has to be made up or forced.  Not that i am dual personality or anything but rather i am just very universal...<br><br>I rememebr reading quite a few times about children who grew up under multicultural environments with two value systems like I did ( i actually grew up under asian values, american values and british values)....I won;'t get into tmy histroy but suffice to say that people with my background usually can adapt verty easily to their surroundings and environments.  Usually have a lot of diplomatic ability with an afinity to undestanding people without even havingto consider it first.  I beleiev that i ahev these abilities also and after reading those articles know now that it must be true.<br><br>So the perosnality and character i put forward are my real selves no matter how varied they may be.<br><br>The only other thing that is a very apparent mask for me is my physical appearance.  used to mask the fact that i am really very gentle...as a form of very effective self-protection...but even still, i wouldn;'t be able to put across this mask if i didn't have this insid eof me already right?<br><br>So in effect, a lot fo the masks people wear(that they can wear comfortably), are actually extensions of different aspects of their personality...<br><br>Maybe i might be worng ar..hehehhe but anyway it;'s how i feel and it's how i try and live my life by...hehe just dun flame me..mi innoccent..:-)<br><br>But yeah...masks do serve their purpose, but I think that one has to be conscious of them as often as possible...and then ask yoursefl why you need to be liek this or whay you want to be like this...or is it that you really are like this...<br><br>Sometimes the conflict in peopels personalities are the pre-acknowledgement of what they are or will be so is it really a mask?...heheh now that didn't make sense..heheh~</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To the Goddess of Love,<br><br>The sum of all my thoughts on this subject could be found in a song in the musical "Phantom of the Opera" entitled "Masquerade". I will prefer to live the same person in my real life as well as in cyber life. I don't see why I need a mask to get through. Perhaps, sometimes now, I don't know how much I have evolved as I took a different perspective, and for a moment, after reading all the posts here, I suddenly began to wonder whether I have really become different or perhaps wearing a mask....
