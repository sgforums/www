Your sayings are completely different from my teacher. He says that qigong will be able to take blows, but not bullets, or even knives. Those that can take knives are another form of qigong, and even so, also got limit. I don't know how you can a bullet. With bullet travelling so fast, the impact is going to be very big. You sure you can take that?</div>

He says that qigong will be able to take blows, but not bullets, or even knives.</blockquote>qi-gong is actually about internal strength, or "qi". also called nei-gong.<br>if your internal strength very high, then can withstand a lot of physical violence.<br><br>however, the modern day skills for training nei-gong, such as QiGong, very "down-graded" compared to last time Song's dynasty and earlier.<br>those skills like JiuYang ShenGong belong to the forgotten realms/category of nei-gong training already. u never see the real power of JiuYang before right?<br>not i want to say, but everytime i see those QiGong masters making a fool out of themselves by letting trucks roll over them, i really say "how pathetic it is that they're insulting *real* martial arts like this"? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>next time, ask your master come see me. he stand 500 metres away from me and i'll propel him and make him retreat 60 steps against his own accord, just by channeling out my qi, based on JiuYang teachings.<br><br><blockquote>With bullet travelling so fast, the impact is going to be very big. You sure you can take that?</blockquote>the point is not how fast the bullet is. as long as the qi in you is always at a very immense and extreme level, no problem......because the bullet, no matter how fast, will still hit you at the end.<br><br>thus, if your qi inside is boiling strong, bullet, anything, no problem.</div>
