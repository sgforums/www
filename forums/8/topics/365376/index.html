              <p>Hey Group!</p>
              <p>I am an unknown author in the US. (I hope to change that!) Part of my book is placed in Singapore. The last time I was there was in 2001 so I'm sure things have changed some since then. There are terms said in the book that I want to make authentic to the normal Singapore slang. I am hoping someone's willing to help me on this. I've already been to the TalkingCock for some ideas but I am not sure how accurate that may be.</p>
              <p>In the US, we use the terms:</p>
              <p>What a blast.</p>
              <p>That's cool.</p>
              <p>Are you crazy?</p>
              <p>Oh my God.</p>
              <p>Dude. Man.</p>
              <p>Pissed off (meaning mad, angry)</p>
              <p>Stupid, Fool, Idiot</p>
              <p>Then there are pet names like, sweetheart, babe, honey etc. for our boyfriend/girlfriend. I realize English is spoken  and most of these terms may be the same but I want to write this as if you were reading the book. What would you find accurate? I noticed 'lah' and 'leh' at the end os phrases and I figure this to be the same as when a Canadian says 'eh'. But would these words be used by a working professional with an age of thirty?</p>
              <p>Any help would be great. Anyone willing to help me for a short time with this, I would really appreciate it. You can verify on my website:</p>
