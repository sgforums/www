In the T'ang dynasty, fireworks were invented. These were originally for shows, but later on they used them to scare of enemies in war. The fireworks were mainly small bamboo cases filled with gunpowder, and a fuse was put on the side.<br><br>In the Han dynasty, they invented the wheelbarrow, which was for carrying loads too heavy for a normal person's back to support. The wheelbarrow was originally wood, so the Chinese nick named it the 'wooden ox'.<br><br>OTHER INVENTIONS<br><br>The compass was for religious use. When a new houses was being built, the used it to see if the house was faced in perfect harmony with nature (which meant they thought if you faced your house to magnetic north, you and nature would get along). The compass started out as a wooden circle with markings on it, and a magnetic spoon on top.<br><br>Designed with a machine called the Earthquake weathercock, which was a contraption that told them when and where an earthquake would come. This machine looked like a giant six-foot bronze pot that had dragon heads lining the top, and ivory frogs under each dragon.<br><br>Spaghetti<br><br>The Chinese first manufactured the 'fan', which was mostly carried by women and soldiers. Most of the fans were made out of bamboo and silk. The fan was basically many bamboo spines sticking out in almost a half circle with silk wrapped around it.<br><br>First to create kites, which mostly children played with. The kites were most of the time silk squares, held together by bamboo.<br><br>Created many things with bamboo, which made a lot of baskets and holders and were really strong.<br><br>The Chinese were the first to discover iron casting around the sixth century, when they mixed tin and copper together.<br><br>Revolutionized agriculture by harnessing animals<br><br>made boats modern with magnetic compasses, sternpost rudders and watertight flamboyance, plus many other things to long to tell.<br><br>The first clock that they devised was for astronomical uses. In the first clock ever, there was a puppet that would hold up a plaque that would tell the time. They also invented giant water clocks, which rang every fifteen minutes.<br><br>The first blast furnace, which was water powered.<br><br>To Chinese, jade was more valuable then gold.<br><br>They invented the first object for counting, called an abacus.<br><br>The Chinese used a method of medicine called acupuncture<br><br>They were the first to discover the rudder<br><br>Processed grain with bamboo machinery<br><br>They made most toys, machines, houses, and other things from bamboo.<br><br>The Chinese also were the first to think of harvesting silk, and make clothes, fans, kites, toys, paper, and lots of other things from it.<br><br>They produced the first planetarium, which was actually made by an emperor. The planetarium was a big enclosed place with stars and constellations on the inside. The person using the planetarium would sit in a chair that was hanging from the top of the enclosed dome.<br><br>In the 3rd century, they a found a wine that acted like anesthetic, and they also used herbs before the age of written history</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Invented paper and printing<br><br>In their writing, there were 80,000 different symbols<br><br>The first to invent books and had book shops in every city by the end of the T'ang dynasty<br><br>There were 3 different important kinds of paper, the very first being silk rags. The cheap kinds were no more then wooden strips, and the most expensive was silk cloth. Although most of the kinds of paper was made from over 50% bamboo, some of the other things they were made of were silk, cloth, hemp, mulberry bark, and plant fibers.<br><br>In the Han dynasty, 206B.C.-A.D.220, paper and ink were invented.<br><br>In the T'ang dynasty, 618-906, the first printer was invented.<br><br>In 868 AD the earliest known book ever was printed.<br><br>At Dongkou Village, where Bouyei people live, we can see an open dam through which a limpid river flows, and flocks of ducks are seen sporting and playing in it. On the banks Bouyei women in groups of two and three wash clothes. All Are quiet, leisurely and carefree.<br><br>Looking down from a high place, we can wee large and small steaming and boiling kilns, fermenting pools and lime pits scattered all over like stars in the sky, as if to tell and sing a story of long, long ago. Near high and low thatched cottages are papermaking workshops and a water-powered mill wheel.<br><br>The local records say that the papermaking industry there began 300 years ago, in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. Later it flourished during Qing emperor Qian Long's reign(1736-1796), and the number of papermaking households increased from three to a dozen. Every household had eight kilns, with a monthly rough-straw paper (or toilet paper) output of 150 kg. At that time, hand production included husking bamboo and hemp with pestles and mortars. Today, such primitive means of production can still be seen in Xieyao Village, Changshun, 30 kilometers from Huishui.<br><br>In the early 20th century, Dongkou's papermaking industry spread to more than 100 households. The husking of bamboo and hemp was then done by water- or ox-powered roller. In the 1940s, papermaking there became more flourishing, and production spread to 150 households, with a total of 300 kilns. The number of papermaking workshops grew to 180, grinding 1.5 million kilograms of bamboo raw materials a year with 60 rollers. Its annual output was 0.5 million tons of rough-straw paper. Today, both rough-straw paper and paper money are good sellers in all corners of the province.<br><br>To make rough-straw paper takes two kinds of bamboo as raw materials, with the addition of birch leaves, lime and water. Generally, the paper, called zhuma (bamboo hemp), is clean and is a good absorbent. One special use is for putting under corpses.<br><br>Birch leaves are necessary materials for papermaking. The mucilage is drained out of the leaves for strengthening the adhesion of the paper, and for improving its smoothness and evenness. First, bamboo is husked with a pestle and mortar. It is then placed in a pool of lime to soak for several days to make it soft. It is then put into a big kiln for steaming and boiling for 35 days. After being rinsed in river water, it is again steamed and boiled for another ten days before being ground into pieces and put into a pool of pure water. After mucilage from birch leaves has been added, it is then strained. The residue is the pulp raw material.<br><br>Originally, papermakers used bamboo curtains to hang the sheets of pulp on till they dried to the constituency of damp paper. Later, the remaining water was squeezed out.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>About 1,800 years ago, during the Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220), Cai Lun improved China's papermaking technique using bark and hemp. This then became one of the four great ancient inventions of Chin. Today, ancient papermaking has been replaced by modern means of production, but in some places in southwestern China's Guizhou Province, where many people of ethnic-minority groups live; this ancient technique is still practiced.<br><br>In Huishui, Changshun and Danzhai near Guiyang, capital of Guizhou, many papermaking workshops are well preserved. Of them, the biggest is the one in Dongkou Village, Lushan Town, Huishui County, some 80 kilometers south of Guiyang.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>PAPER MONEY<br><br>Invented origami - which originated with the wealthy people in China - when they used expensive paper to write to friends. Before they sent the letters, they folded them up into fancy designs.<br><br>They also modified paper to make raincoats, windows, umbrellas, they used a lot of paper in their houses even windows!<br><br>Many of the children's toys were made out of paper<br><br>Armor for war was made from strengthened paper<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Some of the greatest inventions in the world were by made by the Chinese. INVENTIONS AS A RESULT OF WAR<br>Mostly with the Mongolians<br><br>In the T'ang dynasty, gunpowder was invented, which actually was by accident. They were attempting to make the elixir of life, which was supposed to make you immortal, and was primarily for emperors.<br><br>The first to make bombs for war, in the 17th Century, which were no more then a bamboo shell, about the thickness of two men's legs, and the length of a man's leg. The bombs were then filled with gunpowder, and a fuse like the fireworks, was installed.<br><br>Nest Cart - looked kind of like the Eiffel tower, with a giant birdhouse on top of it. The nest cart was a mobile lookout, for oncoming armies and other things. The people in the nest cart also dropped bombs from their perch, which was perfect because they had a bird's eye view.<br><br>Built the first cannon, which were just bamboo cases holding gunpowder and were put in a big iron cannon.<br><br>Bamboo or iron basket, which was like a smaller version of the cannon, that had arrows with rockets attached to them. The arrow rockets would shoot out of the miniature cannon like bullets out of a gun wood.</div>

Other felicitation was done by guests of honor and vote of thanks by nellamai ramanathan. The welcome address was done by abirami ramanathan.<br><br>About the QUBE XP Hi – definition server:<br><br>The Qube Cinema server, completely conceptualized and developed by Real Image Media Technologies, is highly versatile in handling picture and sound. Designed to be format independent and future proof, it is upgradeable to support new formats that might emerge across the world. Each theater equipped with the Qube Cinema Server has the capability to offer audiences high quality, high definition digital cinema with rock steady picture, even illumination, unsurpassed 6-track digital sound and the absence of any scratches, even on the 100th day of screening, making it the ultimate experience in movie evening.<br><img src="http://www.behindwoods.com/images_new/Real%20Image%20Logo%20copy.jpg"><br>Digital cinema is the projection of features using a digital projector in the theater. The original negative of the film is converted to Hi-Def digital using a HD Telecine. During this stage, the film can be color corrected perfectly in a manner that is impossible when printing on film. This digital copy of the film is then compressed to a format such a s MPEG-2 or Windows Media 9 in order to make it a manageable size to transport to the theater. Finally, the compressed film is encrypted using virtually unbreakable digital methods so that the film cannot be pirated.<br><br>The compressed, encrypted digital version of the film can then be transported to the cinema theater. This can be done using a small hard disc pack, using a fiber optic network or using a satellite system. In the theater, the film is loaded into the Qube Hi-Def Digital Cinema Player and projected onto the screen using a high quality 3-chip DLP projector from companies such as Panasonic, Barco, Christie and Digital Projection.<br><br>The Qube Hi-Def Digital Cinema Player, conceived and developed by Real Image, is highly versatile in handling picture and sound. Designed to be format independent and future proof, the Qube Hi-Def Digital Cinema Player is upgradeable to support new formats that might emerge across the world.<br><br>A digital movie can mean a much wider release enabling screening of the movie in hundreds of theaters across the state on the very first day. More theaters releasing a new film on Day 1 means more audiences flocking to the halls in the first few weeks, increasing collections dramatically. The costs of film prints, which are currently 20 % of a film’s production cost, are reduced to a minimum so there is little additional risk for a distributor to plan a large release. Producers and distributors can reap the rewards of their investments when the film’s publicity is at its peak and thus draw larger crowd.<br><br>The possibilities of video piracy is zeroed in, since there will be no physical prints to copy from.<br><br>The Qube network will be stationed in the following locations..<br><img src="http://www.behindwoods.com/images_new/map.jpg"><br><br></div>
