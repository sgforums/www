            <div class='col-md body'>Cold Water<br>Posted: 12.03.2004<br>Rebecca Heslin<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Watch out convertible-driving, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch-wearing, balding mid-lifers, there's a new identity crisis pulling up next to you -- and it's your kid you sent off to college four years ago in the driver's seat.<br><br>Students spend the college years collecting the puzzle pieces of their lives such as the good GPA, the stellar internship, etc., only to realize after graduation that while the puzzle may appear completed, there is still no clear picture.<br><br>This harsh realization sends many into what has been coined the younger brother to the mid-life crisis -- the "quarter-life crisis."<br><br>"The quarter-life crisis is a fourth through your life when you are uncertain of who you are and where you are suppose to be going, questioning what your purpose in life is," Anderson Hicks, a senior graduating in December in textile design, said.<br><br>As soon as students move their tassel from right to left, they are faced with the fact that they are about to close the door to the 20-some years of a structured life spent in school and open one to the often dreaded "real world."<br><br>While these post-graduation fears faced in one's early 20s may not be a new concept entirely, pop culture has begun putting more emphasis on the phrase "quarter-life crisis" in such forms as movies, music and books. Societal changes magnified through such media may be to blame for the revival of the weight placed on this time in one's life.<br><br>"Society is placing more pressure on students, students are putting more pressure on themselves and parents are putting pressure on students -- more so now than in previous generations," Larry Gourdine of Student Health said.<br><br>Aside from the fact that people are waiting longer to marry in today's society, there are several other factors playing a role in the angst that comes along with life in the early 20s.<br><br>The ever-rising cost of tuition is leaving many students in more debt after they graduate, and that along with the bills and insurance they are now solely responsible for can become very overwhelming to those new to the job market.<br><br>Hicks feels that some of the challenges associated with graduating include "dealing with finances, leaving your friends, and the whole eight-to-five thing."<br><br>Aside from the financial responsibilities and challenges people in their early 20s are faced with, life can also take a drastic turn socially. Students are suddenly faced with the rude awakening that they can no longer go out every night and then show up in the morning with their pajamas on reeking of beer and smoke like they could during their college years.<br><br>"If you oversleep for a class it is O.K., but not in the real world -- there is no room for messing up," Hicks said.<br><br>In essence, graduation symbolizes a turning point in one's life. Only this time around, they are on their own to structure their lives.<br><br>"At this point, you realize you are grown up whether or not you accept that," Philip Corriher, a senior graduating in December in textile management and Spanish, said. "There's no set path or protocol to follow anymore."<br><br>In their book, "Quarterlife Crisis: The Unique Challenges of Life in Your Twenties," published in 2001, Alexander Robbins and Abby Wilner write that "After graduation, the pathways blur. In that crazy, wild nexus that people like to call the 'real world,' there is no definitive way to get from point A to point B, regardless of whether the points are related to a career, financial situation, home or social life."<br><br>Robbins and Wilner write about the angst that comes along with the post-college territory in an effort to prove to those affected by this type of crisis that it is real. It's a good idea for students to start to plan early, or else they may find themselves caught in the whirlwind of reality after graduation.<br><br>"When you're in college you're looking three or four years down the road and not seeing the light at the end of the tunnel," Gourdine said. "Then all of the sudden you're thrown into the real world to fend for yourself -- it can definitely be very overwhelming."<br><br>Essentially the quarter-life crisis is not all that different from that of the one mid-lifers claim to experience.<br><br>"The mid-life crisis is about feeling that one's life is not meaningful and the fear of facing the inevitabilities of growing older," Gourdine said. "The quarter-life crisis is associated with the same type of feelings."<br><br>While essentially the quarter-life crisis is not all that different from that of the one mid-lifers claim to experience, mid-lifers sometimes scoff at the notion of a quarter-life crisis.<br><br>They strike up their violins at the idea that graduates, who have so much ahead of them, are complaining about this tough time in their lives, when they haven't lived that long.<br><br>"Just like everything else, older generations are so far removed from the college generation that they are unable to understand the stresses associated with graduation today," psychology Professor Chris Mayhorn said.<br><br>Many students have heard the age-old clichÃ© come out of their parents' mouth about life when they were in college -- "You just don't know how good you've got it today."<br><br>Gourdine heard those words from his parents' mouths and has come to accept that they don't feel much sympathy toward quarter-lifers.<br><br>"However, they are both very valid problems that are just part of the aging process," he said. "They just come at two totally different points in a person's life."<br><br>Just like any other aspect of the aging process, this one doesn't affect everyone.<br><br>"It's on a continuum -- some graduates will really freak out while others won't at all," Mayhorn said. "It's a possibility that there will be more of a culture shock for those living in dorms versus apartments, because those in apartments have already experienced a preview of life on their own while those in dorms are more sheltered,"<br><br>From a psychological standpoint, this type of crisis is just like any other. The root of the problem is based in the fact that there is some type of change occurring. Any type of change -- good or bad -- causes stress, according to Mayhorn.<br><br>As with all stress, preparation and taking proactive steps can lessen the effects. Planning ahead is crucial in assuring that the pieces fall completely into place one day.<br><br>"As students embark upon graduation, there is stress because they are leaving behind what has been described to them as the best years of their life," Gourdine said. "The more prepared students are at this time in their life, the smoother the transition will be for them."</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>quarter life crisis does not only mean the above stated.<br>it is also about direction in life, especially in your 20s when u feel like u have not achieved a single thing. Some are still living off your parents, without a job. If you are lucky to have a job, u dont have enough $$$ to spend. Others are at a crossroad, dunno whether to switch career, company. a lot of 20 somethings suffer from this crisis. u feel insecure and wonder where u will be in 5 yrs time. Some with high-flying job but leading a very unsatisfied life may feel what is the point of slogging so hard when u cant enjoy life. Others are frustrated at failed relationships.<br></div>
