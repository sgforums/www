No, not the taiwanese, pls.<br>I went around searching for it and I realised alot of vcd shops don't have it in stock because apparently it was not well-received by audiences in Singapore since it did not have considerable amount of eyecandy in the show except for Kuroki Hitomi  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> I think it's because there are no Mr make-a-fish lookalike thats why it does not appeal to girls or even the obasan who are the major contribution to vcd sales in Singapore.<br><br>But then it was the compelling storyline and the badass zaizen goro who glued me to the show. I watched it once last year on Channel U. Now I want to buy the vcd or dvd to watch again. Cmon, anyone who knoes pls? Thanks~[/b]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yes, bai se ju ta. It's so unlike the dumb idol dramas nowadays where handsome hair guy meet cute girl, love here love there, love everywhere, then caught disease or sumthing, separated, 3rd party comes in and ka jiao, but in the end still together again. So got a formula lor.<br><br>This 1 however just relies on a good plot and solid acting, it's a very serious drama but dangg~~ it's so nice.<br><br>Oh hi Mr Storywolf, I dun mind a 2nd hand 1 though. Just quote me a price and I'll consider.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Zaizen is such an asshole but goddamnit, I actually rooted for him in the show. When the patient died and they went to court. I just went...oh no...zaizen must win the case no matter what. walow, so bad right. His drive, ambition and the desire to conquer all.<br>And I think the anime dragonball which I watched eons ago, one of the character resembles him alot. Vegeta. Both are selfish bastards who fight only for themselves, they do what they think is right, by any means possible regardless of what other think. But then, they project an aura in which as much as we would like to strangle them with our bare hands, deep down, we just root for them.<br>It was very sad when zaizen lay there, dying. I duno about the taiwanese great white tower but I think it's one of those love love story again. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> I think I'ld just wait for it to show on TV. Beside...I don't think the acting is solid as the jap version.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
