              <p>And besides, lets not sidetrack from the TS's topic.</p>
              <p>I frequent SLS very much and I know their standards. I have no idea about the shops at the 1st  and 2nd floor. I mainly frequent those from 4th and upwards and all I have got to say is they are honest to me and I have visited most of the shops there..</p>
              <p>Of course, you will have to know ur stuff as always and should have done your research before hand. I find them very friendly and I can always bargain a bit with them to get $5 or $10 off..  So yah.. Please don't label all of them as goons okie? :)</p>

              <p>thanks a lot, everybody. I cannot access this site from work, sorry for the delay.</p>
              <p>I give the shop keepers credit for the scam, they were good. as I think back through the entire conversation, it's almost an art form :) maybe this is a useful experience, I could have walked into a much bigger scam after having heard so many times "singapore is very safe". now I know better, thanks for the advice guys. but... who I don't give credit to is singapore government, for not doing more about it. and these guys from CASE don't even pick up the phone :) I think ultimately it's bad for business in general. or maybe getting rid of crooks is way harder than getting rid of chewing gum.</p>
              <p>to answer the question somebody asked, I ended up buying a phone that the guy recommended as "very good quality". I couldn't find much on the internet about neither the manufacturer nor the model... inside the box there is no warranty information, just a small booklet with instructions... illegal product if you ask me. but again, credit goes to the seller. I lost all my concentration after the unexpected proof of defects. I am ashamed to say how much I paid for it and can't really make a comparison with other shops. check-mate.</p>
              <p>thanks for the time guys. will definitely do better next time.</p>
