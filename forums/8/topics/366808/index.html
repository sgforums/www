              <p>I found this closed thread http://sgforums.com/forums/1359/topics/343642 made by people that have been scammed in sim lim by this particular phone shop. I have just experienced the same, and thought I'd share it.</p>
              <p>Very much like one story in the thread above, I buy one cordless phone, they give me the receipt, and then... they just want to show me that the phone is not that good, maybe I buy a better one. The guy sets the phone up there, and then calls some free dial number, I listen to some answering machine, there is some background noise, but not too bad, I say it's fine. Then, the guys says the phone is also breaking all the time, calls the phone from his mobile and slowly counts from 1 to 12. there are 3 or 4 one second breaks, some numbers drop out completely, supposedly because of the poor quality of the phone. bullshyte, the answering machine I heard before was not breaking out at all! the guy was pressing the mute button on his mobile phone (I suspect he was doing the same in the other story as well, to prove that the cordless phone doesnt work beyond 5 meters). no damn cordless phone in this day and age, not even the cheapest, has so many brealks in 20 seconds and from 50 cm of the cordless receiver, not even the worst of the worst. and this was a panasonic too. this was a carefully coreographed  and well rehearsed scam.</p>
              <p>of course, I only realized this after I left the shop... bought a more expensive one from these crooks, which I didn't need. not going to take it back after reading what others have gone through trying that. I wouldn't mind having my money back, but more importantly, can't just leave these crooks pretend to do business. any suggestions, please let me know guys. will try consumer protection monday, don't know what else is there to try.</p>

              <p>Sim Lim is a place for those who are 'experienced' and know the ways there.</p>
              <p>People who are not brought there by their friends who are 'regulars' tend to be easily ''legally scammed'' by the unscruplous lot there.</p>

              <p>back to practical matters, are you all suggesting that there is nothing I can do but learn the lesson? also, it puzzles me that a place like sim lim that is so widely known for illegal practices is allowed to do business. these shops must be licensed by some government body, why don't they do anything about it? is it because they only target tourists?...</p>

              <p>Hi, it's the same in most parts of the world. Tourists and foreigners get "cheated" by small stores.</p>
              <p>Give them credit that they managed to "convince" you to buy a more expensive one.</p>

              <p>Well, the most common one would be reporting the matter to CASE but most probably they can't do anything as you are convinced to buy something willingly... even at a higher price (There is no standard retail price for electronics).</p>
              <p>Just believe in yourself next time you wanted to purchase an item. Even in normal retail stores, these things happens... when the other item would fetch a higher com, which sales would not push that item?</p>
              <p>Btw, you found out how much more did you paid for the item compare to the normal retail price in major electronic store yet? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>thank you for the replies, guys, maybe that's a bit more insight
                  than I need at the moment. is ah neh a word for indian
                  people?(google search again)</p>
              <p>I come from somewhere in europe, small country.</p>
              <p>back to practical matters, are you all suggesting that there is
                  nothing I can do but learn the lesson? also, it puzzles me that a
                  place like sim lim that is so widely known for illegal practices is
                  allowed to do business. these shops must be licensed by some
                  government body, why don't they do anything about it? is it because
                  they only target tourists?...</p>

              <p>'ah neh' is a disrespectful term which refers to Indians.</p>
              <p>And yes, there is nothing much you can do, since you are the one who agreed to their pricings.</p>
              <p>And don't worry, there are also plentiful of locals who often get scammed there, so tourists are not the only ones who experience such crap.</p>
