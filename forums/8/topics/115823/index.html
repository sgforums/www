He could easily converse in either language and will not mind watching Chinese movies or dramas. However, that's one Indian. There will always be others. What I meant by ideal is that someone who will see eye to eye with you. Ideal love to me is an impossible thing, so I don't mind, but most people will prefer someone they love to be someone who can understand them.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>-----<br><br>I'm Looking 4 Trouble, where are you?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
