            <div class='col-md body'>I had a case 2 yrs ago, i had this friend who totally abuses my trust a a loyal friend, by spreading my secrets and 'borrowing' money from me. His father owns a shop which sells those hi-fi's tv's etc, and i wanted to get one discman from him, by paying through installments. After paying $100++( which at that time to me was too much) he juz said the discman was sold to sumone else. That's only one case. Just last yr on the first, i went to holland Village to celebrate the new yr, and we stayed out late outside. Then I was beaten up in the face by this indian man, and this 'friend' juz sat there and did nothing.....<br><br>Not only that, after that, when i returned to school, the principal wanted to know who was involved in the incident, and so i wrote down his name. He immidiately spread rumors abt me being a coward, and made all my close friends hate me. And that at that time I finally gave up on him........<br><br>And to think that i treated him as a friend 4 2 yrs..............<br><br>What would u do if u had the same incident?</div>

It is indeed admirable.<br><br>I do understand that it is hard to accept betrayals from good frens but unfortunately, it does happen. It happened to me as well. I learnt from it and became wiser in choosing frens. If it happens once, it is his fault, if it happens twice, it is your fault.<br><br>Life is a process, and you learn along the way  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Take it as a lesson.

            <div class='col-md body'>1) Run the whole incident through your head. Realize your immediate feelings after that. Do you think that he/she treated you like a friend?<br><br>2) Being forgiving is one thing but being over-forgiving is another. There is a limit to everything in life. Realize yours and stick to it. People will take advantage otherwise.<br><br>3) If you really feel edgy about the whole thing, confrontation will reveal all. Have a smooth but firm talk with your friend, telling him/her how you feel.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Heehz... here's one. My best friend since Pri. 1 betrayed me by stealing my girlfriend from me in Sec 3. I thought I knew him inside out, since we were practically in the same class and school every year, live a coupla blocks away from each other, and go home in the same bus everyday for 9 years.<br><br>The line from this song "Johnny... Don't point that gun at me." seems apt to describe the feelings that time.<br><br>We're still friends (no longer best friends. You can say we're just acquaintances.) now, since we found out that the girl was actually trying to make use of both of us. However, just to be safe, I made sure that my current gf doesn't even know he exists.<br><br>A bit extreme, I know. But better safe than never....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Hope you don't feel as miserable AngelDark.<br><br>------------------<br>"A Gentleman is not an implement."<br>-Confucius, Analects, 2:12</div>
