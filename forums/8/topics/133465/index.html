            <div class='col-md body'>sorry to burst your bubbles guys, but feelings and love especially are much much more than chemicals. the one chemical most commonly associated to love would be oxytocin...but that gives a feeling of infatuation. its produced at the start of relationships...the whirlwind romance part. after that, different chemicals are produced, but they seem more of a marker or indication of where the relationship is heading, more than anything.<br><br>i doubt it that feelings would be as simple as we think it is, just electrical brain waves and chemicals. alot of it is over simplified, leading us to think that such chemical tweaking is possible when it truly is still quite far from inception. also, the hair starnd thing to analyse chemical patterns of people? you need a huge amount that has not been cleared up to know what "feelings" a person has. a lot of these feeling hormones are cleared up after they've had their desired effect. really a combination of nervous, endocrine and advanced brain activity than simply chemicals. also, the body has natural limits for different hormones, like feel good dopamine and serotonin. too much, and production will stop, coupled with a huge clean up operation in for that hormone in question. all to do with the body's natural regulation system.<br><br>so for now, i guess its safe to say that we cant really play God in this area yet, can we. the future is a lot brighter than we make it out to be... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
