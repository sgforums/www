            <div class='col-md body'>"Intellectual" sacarstic? I hope not heh. Anywya....<br><br>LDR=Long Distance Relationship? If so then propbly it's demanding if you zealously want to document his/her social life overseas. But if you just want to know who her friends are, then alright. But I guess that's just a broad way of defining everything.<br><br>HOW much you want to know is another thing. If you want to know all her friends overnight and as much about that as possible, that'd irritate the hell out of me.<br><br>Basically, the only thing holding you 2 together in a LDR is love and trust. Actually more of the latter. The physical aspect of a r/s isn't around for most of the year, and while it can be the strongest bond, it can be the weak link in a chain, coz it's always damm easy to get physically attracted to someone else.<br><br>However, if you trust your gf, then that shouldn't be a problem. If you do, let her live her life overseas, and you live yours here. Ask her how she is, what was her week like and stuff,but demanding details would be too excessive.<br><br>Doubting your gf/bf would be the worst in a LDR.<br><br>On a brighter side,my classmate has been with her bf who's in the US for like almost 3 years. He left when they just got together and in her words "she hasn't physically been together with him in the same country for more than a month at a stretch". Pretty taxing Iwould imagine, but they're still going. Ofcourse,email and ICQ and Netmeeting has helped a lot.<br><br>They also have a rather unique agreement allowing each party to see or date other ppl. I'm not sure if every r/s can take that but well when you're young, you'll always like to keep your options open. While neither side has actually seriously used that agreement,the fact that such an agreement can actually exist examplifies the importance of trust in a r/s, what strength it brings to a r/s.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, dil, all my friends who are in a LDR always break up because why? they dun trust each other, they not mature enuff, they dun trust each other... i dun want to discourage u but it really depends on the level of trust. i've a friend here who has a LDR but he dates other women here. his reason was because "a girlfriend is suppose to listen to your problems, basically be ur close friend... AND be physically intimate as well... we long distance, how to be physically intimate?" his gf trusts him alot and rarely ever calls up to check on him... I dun want to make u sad, but like zippo say, alot of young people like to keep their options open. This person could be the one or it could be the next one, u never know unless u try... and checking up on him/her will piss them off... its like having ur mom breath down on ur back every second... dat would sux, rite?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dil...!!!! err same dil i know?<br><br>Anyway i don't belive in LDR..cos it defeats the purpose of a relationship in the 1st place. The idea or my idea of a relationship is so that we can be close to one another and be there for each other. If that is not possible then why bother.<br><br>No it isn't too much to ask wat u ask cos that is wat everyone wants in a relationship wether long or short distance. The problem is that in your case being so far and only being able to tok to her and not able see her face to face will only bring you insecurity. This feeling of insurcurity will make your simple question full of suspision and jealous to her on the other end.<br><br>So of cos she'll bitch at you.<br><br>------------------<br>+++++++++++++++++++++++<br>Guns don't kill People<br>People Kill People<br>+++++++++++++++++++++++<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well LDR's are probably like rubber-bands. Depending on the thickness and strength, the longer you stretch it and then release it, the more distorted it's shape will be.<br><br>If your r/s is firm and sturdy with lots of trust ie. a thick rubber band, then there'll be less distortion.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>great analogy zippo  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> basically dil, it all depends on how you ask her. if you do tt whole 20 qns thg first thg you talk to her then i wont be surprised if she gives up on you. but if she mentions her day/one of her frens and you casually ask for more details then.. hey, what's wrong with tt? just make sure she knows you TRUST her. yeah, sounds naggy but tt's the main thg in ANY relationship, LD or otherwise.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all, thanks for all the responses.<br><br>Killjoy, how are you doing? Yeah, it's me, dil. Haven't been going to the chat room 'cos I was pretty busy and pretty vexed by your know what lah. Anyway, I personally don't agree with you idea of a relationship. It is more than physical closeness. But I got to admire that having someone by yourself when you are feeling down and stress is a huge plus. Chemistry, love, able to communicate and trust are some other huge factors involves. Also, the temporary separation will make the temporary reunion so much sweeter and unforgettable. Had a good time when I was home last summer. *smile*<br><br>On the other hand, you made a good point regarding the insecurity part. Being thousands of miles apart really renders both parties defenceless against potential "hitters" (aka buaya) and temptations. And this can only be solved by mutual trusting.<br><br>Trust is a common theme in the postings of Cluon, Zippo and ataraxia. It is really the only significant thin thread that is holding a LDR together. I don't trust pple easily 'cos it is my way of preventing myself from getting hurt. However I think it is working against me right now. Gotta work on it somehow.<br><br>Ataraxia, I think you too made a good point in your post. Think about it, it is a real big pain if the first thing the other partner asks you is "Who did you go out with?" Police interrogating a suspect or something. *shrug* I really have to admit that I fall into that trap pretty often. Bad, hope the damage is still repairable...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well dil, i understand how you feel. personally, i dont trust anybody.. subconscious action actually, which i only truly realised recently. sad huh? but if you "love" her enuff to be in a LDR, shldnt you trust her as well? trusting someone, means tt you're dependant on tt person in a way.. which is a very scary feeling. however, what's life w/o a lil pain huh?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>abt the 20 qns.. i thk your gf will understand, esp if she's going thru the same emotional turmoil, wondering who you're with, what you're doing, if you've found someone new.. however, she cld be having a blast w her 'new life' and may resent this 'intrusion' or view it as you being possessive and paranoid. the key word here is communication. tell her how you feel candidly and frankly. tell her all your fears, emotions, worries... if she's tt great a ger she'll at least take the time to listen. however, take care not to whine, spy's case is the ideal eg why not to.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> all in all, the strongest bond between you guys wld still be tt dirty four letta word: love. if you truly love each other enuff, do your best to wk out the kinks. afterall, it isnt everyday you find someone you love...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ataraxia, the line between communicating one's emotion and whining about how one's been hurt is really fine. What I thought to be "communicating" my feelings might be thought of as whining by the other party. The art of communication is not easy to acquire.<br><br>Are you really only in Sec 3? I kinda don't believe it. I was still hanging out at MickeyD's when I was your age. Hahaha, see, my "mis-trusting" instinct is firing up again.</div>
