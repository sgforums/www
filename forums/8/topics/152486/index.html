            <div class='col-md body'>Thursday, April 21, 2005<br>Fincher shooting Zodiac film<br><br>Well, against all odds, Fincher has begun casting for his new movie... and it won't be Benjamin Button. Instead, as reported here a few months ago, it will be the new Zodiac Killer film that he attatched himself to. And so far, it seems to be a rather interesting and talented cast.<br><br>From DarkHorizons.com<br><br>"Mark Ruffalo is in negotiations and Jake Gyllenhaal and Robert Downey have signed onto David Fincher's long-gestating thriller "Zodiac" according to The Hollywood Reporter. The Paramount and Warner Bros. co-production is aiming to begin filming in August.<br><br>Gyllenhaal will play Robert Graysmith, the journalist and author of the two books, "Zodiac" and "Zodiac Unmasked: The Identity of America's Most Elusive Serial Killer Revealed," upon which the film's script by Jamie Vanderbilt is based. Downey will play fellow reporter Paul Avery, and Ruffalo would play the San Francisco homicide inspector in charge of the case.<br><br>The books revolve around the real-life tale of a serial killer known as the Zodiac Killer, who terrorized San Francisco between 1966-1978 and had at least 37 murders to his name. Graysmith and Avery worked at the San Francisco Chronicle, which the killer used as a conduit to communicate with authorities. The former believed he had identified the killer but competing investigations and other circumstances prevented the suspect from being apprehended."<br><br>Hopefully it won't be a retread of Seven, but I have faith in Fincher, and eagerly await this new film. The script was written by Jamie Vanderbilt (The Rundown). While I thoroughly enjoyed the rundown, I hope Finch still brings in Andrew Kevin Walker to do a rewrite</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So the Zodiac Killer choose his/her victims based on their Zodiac signs? Catching serial killer is always the hardest for police cuz the motive is not about money or love but a depraved appetite for perverse ritual killing and satisfaction. With such motive, how to nail the serial killer? And very often they are smart ppl who like to play games with the police. To them it is a challenge to the authorities to apprehend them.<br><br>But I like to watch serial killer movies cuz they will portray how ingenious the killers are and how incompetent and stupid the police are until the hero of the movie steps in to catch the killer.

I guess he taken to going back to the serial killer genre again. I suppose most people if not all would like to see him direct movies like Se7en, Fight club.<br><br>Wait for Zodiac, We can revisit Se7en again.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Andrew Kevin  Walker and Fincher pulled out the masterpiece called Se7en in  the 90s. Perfect movie. Should be seen in the theatre to get the full effect. Since then i been following the director's movies<br><br>I own the collector's edition DVD of Se7en. Perfect pic and sound quality.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>David fincher made only a few  films but his films leave a huge impact on the viewer especially  seven. Love that movie..His movies excel in the visual department to being out the mood..Alien 3 could have been so much better if the studio didnt interfere in his creative process. Above all, the film in that series is a different altogether. With dark stark visionary and editing.Under disguise it addresses the  Aids holocaust and the many religious references to Christ. The starting scenes where the deceased were shown in the form of computer screens was a testament to his dark creative process<br><img src="http://www.fiorina.ibt.pl/ripleycap.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.fiorina.ibt.pl/dwaynecap.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.fiorina.ibt.pl/newtcap.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.fiorina.ibt.pl/bishopcap.jpg"><br><br>But Panic Room did not come out that well as his previous movies though the resemblance in the climax scene where the thugs surrender have the same grandeur feeling to Alien 3<br><br>There is a full  unedited version of Alien 3 on DVD with more than 30 mins of deleted scenes readded. The way Fincher conceived it... Recommend watching it...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You all are going for some specific director movies? For me I have no preference I thrive on the story lines instead. Tonite there will be one more called Kiss The Girls which is also about a serial rapist/killer? I remember last time also got one called Bone Collector.<br><br>I think recently there is one called SAW? A killer tied 2 person to each other and then leave a saw behind for one of them to use it to free himself? There is another about a doctor surgeon whose daughter has a rare disease as in her hands will rot away by herself after a few months but her daughter is a brilliant pianist. So the doctor kidnapped young children saw off their hands and sew it onto her daughters hand. This ritual has to be repeated every few months until a cure is found for her daughter strange illness. Another cool movie theme.<br><br>Anyone into the hobby of collecting serial rapist/killer movies? Can recommend some other? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
