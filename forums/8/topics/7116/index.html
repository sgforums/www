Why is changing yourself for a relationship a bad thing? I feel that it is not necessary so. If there is something bad about oneself like maybe self-centeredness in a rs, isn't it a good thing to change? Changing and adapting is not necessarily bad, as long as you don't fundamentally change who you really are.</div>
