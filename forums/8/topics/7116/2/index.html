I never said i am willing to let her go.<br>I actually begged her not to leave me but she insisted. I told her i love her but she just left me, saying things like "we're very different..".<br>Though i usually let her have what she wanted in an arguement.<br><br>2. I have always tried my best to help her when she has problems.<br><br>I did tried to call her up many times everyday since the day we broke-off but each time she refuse to listen to my call.<br><br>There was 1 time i even called up to 20+ times just to stop her leaving me.<br>I didn't even know i had called 20 times<br>until she finally replied<br>"Stop bothering me!<br>Do you know you have called over 20 times and you're disrupting my incoming calls??"<br><br>She said she loved me. Why is she like this now..?<br><br>ahh, you still think i deserve it now?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Poopooman, sorry to tell you this, but I think you have to let her go. People will obviously get irritated when you call non-stop.<br><br>Firstly, from my view, I think that the problem has been there for a long time. Maybe the lack of communication is the key issue here. I think you've tried to lie to urself that everything is fine and just give in to whatever she wants. Sometimes, a girl wants the guy to have his own opinion and also a little bit of argument is healthy in a relationship as it release tension from building up.<br><br>Anyway, try not to always let girls have their way, coz' they'll think u're pathetic if u do that all the time. It's different from pampering them.</div>
