            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Mel Gibson's "The Passion of the Christ" will be the first movie here to be screened under the new Mature-18 film category when it comes into effect next Monday.<br><br>This comes as part of the Media Development Authority's (MDA) revised film rating system.<br><br>Critically acclaimed films like American Beauty will no longer be restricted to viewers 21 years and above with the new Mature-18 (M-18 ) category.<br><br>Both cinemagoers and the film industry welcomed the news.<br><br>"I am going to go to NS soon so I think I'll be matured enough to view such films," said one movie fan.<br><br>Kenneth Tan, Managing Director, Golden Village, said: "I think that anything that results in an increased repertoire of films being able to be shown and anything that increases our audience base potentially means greater returns and greater profits for the cinema."<br><br>But the floodgates will not be opened.<br><br>M-18 movies must be quality films with good acting, scripting, production values and artistic integrity.<br><br>Fitting the bill is "The Passion of the Christ" which will be shown in cinemas next week.<br><br>Under the old film rating system, this film would surely have been classified R(A), accessible only to those 21 years and above.<br><br>That is because of the violent scenes showing the whipping and crucifixion of Jesus Christ.<br><br>But as the scenes are considered integral, the film will go uncut and be classified M-18.<br><br>The film was also approved only after consultation with religious leaders.<br><br>M-18 films can also be screened in the heartlands. But response to this has been mixed.<br><br>"Whether it screens in HDB (neighbourhoods) or Orchard Road, I don't think it matters at all. Now tapes and blue films are easily available, it's beyond adults' control," said one moviegoer.<br><br>One teenager pointed out: "Youngsters are more likely to hang out (in town) than in HDB estates."<br><br>R(A) films, now known as R-21, will continue to be restricted to cinemas outside HDB estates.<br><br>Another first - consumer advisory will be made mandatory for all films rated NC-16, M-18 or R-21.<br><br>"Apart from ratings, we would like the public to make an informed choice. There are some adults who would not like to see graphic violence or horror," said Amy Chua, Director, Media Content Division, MDA.<br><br>But as the rules relax for adults, the censors will be stricter on films for younger viewers.<br><br>Those with violent scenes and coarse language will be classified NC-16, instead of just requiring parental guidance. - CNA<br></div>

They'll go through the film and tell the distributors what the ratings should be. The distributors then decide whether they want to go ahead for a smaller market or engage their own guys to edit the film and submit for ratings again.<br>It all boils down to how much profits they can make.<br><br>No media will communicate, broadcast or print for an altruistic reason of informing the public or entertaining or transmitting culture.

Singaporeans like to complain abt govt being restrictive, trying to con them etc.... but seriously, how many voters are willing to take to the streets for something they believe in and is against the govt.??</div>
