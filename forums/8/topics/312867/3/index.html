              <p>Shows your absolute ignorance in this matter. The japanese are forever "proving" with their tiny dick scientists that the photos were fake and yadadadada while meanwhile Amensty International, the red cross, the un, the soviet union( now russia) and even goddam fucking America has statisitcs that show at least 300,000 people died directly to japanese hands in Nanking. And FYI, its not fucking PRC VS Kuomingtang its the COMMUNIST PARTY vs KMT and i would say its absurdly retarded you assume they would be fighting in china's fucking capital while the japanese rape their daugthers and wives and kill their sons.</p>
              <p>Closer investigation? OTHER THAN THOSE JAP WANKS, CITE ME A FUCKING SOURCE FOR THIS. You fucking can't. Oldest forumite indeed. Senile with fucking age.</p>

              <p>sigh. i'm really torn up here. ok, this is the issue. of course we should forgive because it's the past. and it's not the current japanese's fault, it's the fault of their ancestors, and they're prolly dead or dying themselves. death is the ultimate equalizer.</p>
              <p>but we cannot deny the hurts and emotional scars that the victims went through. you can't just get raped and watch your family members killed, and be told to just drop it because of the past. the victims need justification, or at the very least, acknowledgement that they went through those suffering.</p>

              <p>As passionate as you are, you can always reply in a nice civilised manner. No need to be rude. You are just discrediting yourself even if you are right. State your points clearly and concisely. You may attack his points but not the person himself.</p>
              <p>Now, it is clearly pointless for me to shove my views into your face because you have kept an extremely strong stance in your views it will be pointless to try to argue with you till the cos come home.</p>
              <p>But my views here will be as follows.</p>
              <p>WW2 had been a very terrible war. Millions of people have died, all have suffered. But even among the fog of war, you can see the bright side of the people involved, as well as their dark side. Would it be fair then to accuse the good people for the actions of the evil ones?</p>
              <p><br>The fact is, I believe the Japanese gov should apologise. But the world should be prepared to let go too. Those who have been involved, are already dead or dying. Would it be fair for the next few generations to fight over what the past has done? If that is the case, what lessons have we learnt from the past? To hate one another with each other's guts? Just because my grandpa fought with their grandpa? I find it irrelevant.</p>
              <p>The world have to move on. It is time for the world to cooperate rather than to fight over an issue that has been there for the past 70 years.</p>
