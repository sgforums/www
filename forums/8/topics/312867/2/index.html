              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Massacre and Slaughter of the Overseas Chinese</span><br><br>A.D. 1603 - Manila, Philippines<br>24,000 massacred by Spaniards when Ming Mandarins<br>visited the islands sparking fears of Chinese dominance.<br><br>A.D. 1662 - Manila, Philippines<br>30,000 put to sea and expelled from the Philippines.<br>Those caught outside the Parian (Manila's Chinese<br>ghetto) were beheaded immediately.<br><br>A.D. 1639-1640 - Manila, Philippines<br>20,000 die in anti-Chinese violence<br><br>A.D. 1686 - Manila, Philippines<br>Anti-Chinese violence<br><br>A.D. 1740 - Batavia, Indonesia (Batavian Fury)<br>10,000 Chinese slaughtered by Dutch when the Chinese<br>objected to forced removals to Sri Lanka as slave<br>labour.<br><br>A.D. 1763 - Manila, Philippines<br>Anti- Chinese violence<br><br>A.D. 1792 - Cholon, Vietnam (Ho Chi Minh City)<br>10,000 Chinese massacred in the Tay Son movement's<br>retaking of Cholon from Nguyen Anh who in 1780 had<br>proclaimed himself the new Nguyen ruler. According to<br>Nguyen records, Nhac of Tay Son lost one of his closest<br>aides, killed by Nguyen troops who happened to be ethnic<br>Chinese. In revenge, Nhac ordered the killing of ethnic<br>Chinese in the city including the women and children. It<br>has been speculated that this act was also to destroy the<br>ethnic Chinese commercial monopoly.<br><br>A.D. 1823 - South Borneo<br>10,000-20,000 Chinese massacred when Chinese "kongsi"<br>resisted the withdrawal and reselling of mining<br>concession to the Dutch by local Sultans due to<br>monetary jealousy and rivalry.<br><br>ca. A.D. 1824-1851 Reign of Rama III - Thailand<br>A band of Chinese insurgents capture and loot the city<br>of Chachengsao, causing the majority of the Siamese<br>population to flee the city. The government successfully<br>dispatched troops to put down the affair. After a few<br>confrontations one of the rebel leaders changed sides<br>and led his troops to capture the other rebel leaders. The<br>rest of the rebels soon fled the city and were surrounded<br>by the government troops. The town folk returned and<br>initiated a massacre. Some Chinese tried to flee by<br>becoming monks, but were not spared and many hanged<br>themselves to avoid the slaughter. Deaths numbered in<br>the thousands.<br><br>A.D. 1857 - Sarawak, North Borneo<br>2,000-5,000 Chinese massacred by Raja Brooke when a<br>Hakka gold-mining "kongsi" failed to murder him. Liu<br>Shanbang led 600-armed miners from Bau Lama to attack<br>Kuching on the 18th of February 1857. He succeeded in<br>the attack but James Brooke escaped unhurt. Liu became<br>the de facto 'Rajah' of Sarawak for 5 days from the 19th<br>to the 23rd of February after which Liu and his men<br>retreated to Bau when Tuan Muda Charles Brooke with<br>his Dayak force from 2nd Division (Sri Aman) retaliated.<br>Liu Shanbang was killed at Jugan, Siniawan on or about<br>the 24th of February. His men and their families were<br>mostly killed or suffocated to death by the Rajah's men at<br>Mau San and Ghost Cave areas with some managing to<br>escape to Indonesia.<br><br>A.D. 1871 - Los Angeles, California, USA<br>19 Chinese die when white Los Angeles citizens go bezerk<br>after the accidental killing of a white man by a Chinese<br>laborer.<br><br>A.D. 1877 - Chico, California, USA<br>Anti-Chinese violence.<br><br>A.D. 1885 - Rock Springs, Wyoming, USA<br>Anti-Chinese violence.<br><br>A.D. 1887 - Snake River, Oregon, USA<br>31 Chinese miners massacred in a 2-day orgy of violence.<br><br>A.D. 1890s - San Francisco &amp; Seattle, USA<br>Thousands of Chinese were assaulted in "pigtail cutting<br>parties" by unemployed white vigilantes frightened by<br>the Yellow Peril frenzy.<br><br>A.D. 1942 - Singapore (Operation Sook Ching)<br>70,699 Chinese tortured and/or killed by Japanese<br>Kempeitai in Colonel Tsuji Masanobu's "Sook Ching" or<br>Purification/Ethnic Cleansing in reprisals for overseas<br>Chinese support of mainland China against the Japanese<br>invasion.<br><br>A.D. 1942 - Malaya (Operation Sook Ching)<br>40,000 Chinese killed by Japanese Kempetai in the<br>continuation of the Singapore Sook Ching.<br><br>A.D. 1946 - Malaya<br>The withdrawal of Japanese troops created a power<br>vacuum in Malaya. The predominately Chinese MPAJA<br>representing the victorious Allied forces with the approval<br>of the British, streamed out of the jungles to assume<br>control of towns and villages to impose law and order<br>prior to the British arrival. However, brutal reprisals and<br>witchhunts of Japanese collaborators and police personnel,<br>many of which were from the Japanese favoured Malay<br>population polarised the conflict along racial lines. Malays<br>retaliated with a fiery brand of Malay mysticism, Islam and<br>martial arts, forming the Red Band under Kiyai (Tok Guru)<br>Salleh and the Sabilillah. The Japanese, angered by the<br>MPAJA guerrilla activities during the occupation, joined the<br>Malays in the Batu Pahat area of Johor state to clear the<br>area of Chinese elements. The fighing spread thoughout<br>Malaya with the worst fighting occuring in Northern Johor<br>and central Perak states. Thousands died in the fighting<br>with large areas cleared of Chinese settlers who were<br>forced to flee to the larger cities.<br><br>A.D. 1965-1966 - Indonesia<br>500,000 killed in anti-communist violence, many were<br>local Chinese suspected of communist activities, others<br>were those who joined the PKI (Parti Kommunis Indonesia)<br>ignorant of the ideology but attracted by it's stance for<br>defending worker rights, while many others were innocent<br>victims caught in the frenzied bloodletting of racial<br>jealousy and animosity.<br><br>A.D. 1969 - Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia<br>1500-2000 Chinese dead from racial rioting sparked by<br>Chinese electoral victories in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur<br>which prevented the formation of a Malay dominated state<br>goverment in Selangor and the 2/3 majority in Parliment<br>required to push through constitutional amendments<br>without a referendum.<br><br>A.D. 1998 - Jakarta, Indonesia<br>Thousands of Chinese businesses and homes were burnt,<br>looted and smashed when rampaging youths, chafting<br>under the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, blamed the Chinese<br>for their sufferings and rioted in the streets of Jakarta.<br>Untold numbers of Chinese were killed, Chinese girls were<br>gang-raped and houses plundered. The Indonesian police,<br>unable or unwilling to stop the violence, prompted residents<br>of housing estates to band together to erect barricades,<br>arm themselves and to employ armed guards to patrol the<br>streets.</p>

              <p>Theres nothing wrong at all with the Japanese people of today's modern society. But theres everything wrong with their politicians.</p>
              <p>Instead of showing remose, the Japanese right-wing politicians sanctioned the altering of history text books in an attempt to white-wash their war crime past, denying the future generation from understanding their countries true history.</p>
              <p>How would you feel if our very own government attempted such a stunt on us? Personally, its shameful on so many levels.</p>
