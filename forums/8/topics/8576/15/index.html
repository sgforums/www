            <div class='col-md body'>Well Inzaghi bro, don't count the chicken before they hatch. ManU hasn't played their game yet, who knows what is to come??? So it is 2-0, a minor hiccup, definitely due to the first controversial send-off of McAllister. Two send offs, well, Liverpool has got depth. Who told you that there isn't enough defenders??? And the ball is round, and the human brain is life, Houllier doesn't necessarily need to play a four midfielder game when the suspension takes its place.<br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No choice lah Inzaghi bro, poor refereeing is one major setback that makes the EPL so frustrating to watch. Gone is Petit, just wondering when it will be Vieira's turn. Lots of teams are already drooling as he gets more disappointed with the refereeing system.<br><br>Well, it is a pity of Liverpool. Injured is Berger and Redknapp, out due to suspension in the near future would be Hammann and McAllister. But then, Liverpool's midfield is still going strong. Available is still Smicer, Gerrard, Heggem (can play midfielder role too), Murphy, and lots of others. Players from other positions can also be pulled back to play the midfield role too.<br><br>Kelong referees. Sheesh. (But quite unlike my bro to miss a chance on slashing my team leh, heheheh).<br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rev:<br>well bro, i would love to rub salt into the wounds of Liverpool...how would i not!!!! but if the outcome of the match is heavily determined by the man in black, i can't really say anything right????...who knows one day this may fall on my team *touch wood*....but if ur team play kampong soccer, which is very much capable of, that will be a very different story liao!!!<br><br>i think those big clubs from Italy &amp; Spain should start the move now, if not never!!!! Viera is very depressed, i bet he wanna quit and Wenger must be fearing of losing another key player...let see how Viera cope with the situation...<br><br>well for a team to win the EPL, it must have very capable second team players, just look at my team, u will know liao!!!!...i will sit back and see how ur team react....hmmm, that will be interesting..<br><br></div>
