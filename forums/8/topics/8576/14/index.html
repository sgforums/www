In terms of depth, Liverpool is definitely comparable to Arsenal. But I have this nagging feeling that Liverpool might come up superior, who knows.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Well, for ManU, I have to agree that the flow of play was definitely very smooth as I saw the match (part of it anyway) on Sportscity and I must say, they did play like champions (but don't let the ego start growing yet), I must say that this is only the first match, and I am not being complacent with the 1-0 scoreline, but I simply think it is a good start to a promising season for Liverpool.<br><br>And anytime you want??? Onz.....ManU shop we go.....<br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear sparkle,<br><br>Must you doom my precious heart to even more pieces? Our destiny is not intertwined and the Lord knows how much I am bemoaning about that! I did not reject being your Andy Lau but another goddess has already my poor heart. Given a chance back in the cafÃ© by the forum, I would have approached you regardless of the outcome and the imagined pain on my face. Most pretty one, you are one gal that guys do not give up on, they simply catalogue it to the back of their mind for future reference.<br><br>Buaya you? Of course that thought has cross my mind. I would be lying if I say you do not left a lasting impression on me. After all, not a lot of guys can profess to be unmoved the sight of a Rosamund Kwan look a like. I sincerely hoped that you do not mind if I pay you special attention in this thread. After all, flirting is an art and I am in the middle of this module. Of course, it shows you the grade I am going to get when my designated project (you) did not even respond in the slightest way to my advances.<br><br>Sitting beside you would the greatest honour you can accord to a guy and I am dizzy with pleasure thinking about the prospect of doing that. Alas, we are but faculties apart and it would be difficult for me to join you in lessons together. Needless to say, I get into bouts of depression when I heard that this is last semester in NUS. If not, you can rest assure that all level 4000 modules of Finance will be on my CFM list. Guess the idea of sitting beside you in lecture, drinking in your sweet scent and getting intoxicated by your beauty, will be assigned to the nether realm of dreams.<br><br>My sweet and demure sparkle, see you tonight.<br><br>Forever yours,<br>Hata-san<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Dear sparkle,<br><br>I am so sorry if I had offended your good sense. If my flirting is too blatant and hard to swallow, I apologise for it. Words come naturally to me and praising a woman's beauty is an act of a gentleman, which I aspire to me one.<br><br>Again, my sincerest apologies if my comments has brought you unwanted attention and unwarranted hassle. If you sense some Machiavellian ploys in my recent decent into this thread, I can assure you that there is none. Revelation is someone whom I have met in my NS days and the joke about him being manhunt material is just that, a joke. Please, the world would be a very poor place to live in if we had to judge all praise as a stab in the back or mere flattery to be chucked aside. I will have you know that only a few girls are privileged to list of goddess and again I apologise if you feel that I have been exposing your beauty to the forum.<br><br>My heart belongs to tet and tet only. The fact that she is married does not deter me in the least bit. Naivegirl has the good and comradely sense to ask me to move on with my stalking life but I am afraid I am in too deep for that now. At the risk of sounding melodrama, I liken myself to be a moth edging to towards the candle light, knowing that it spells certain death but yet...destiny beckons and I can't resist her lure.<br><br>It would be indeed callous of me to buaya you after the news of tet's marriage. Yes, my heart hurts more over this slight at my character than at the lack of chances between us. Please my dear darling, how can I ever think of another woman when my heart is filled with one only? Do I really sound so crass to you, am I worth so little in our heart?<br><br>Flirting is what this singles thread is all about. And this is where I will polish my art and practise it elsewhere, most notably on my Goddess. Alas, she is wised to my tricks and honeyed words. You sound hostile my most preciouses sparkle, do you not enjoy my postings to you? Or are you afraid of all those unwanted attention from me? As it is, I am a heart broken man in this virtual life. My stalkee is married and my youthhood idol is scorning me. Alas, is karma knocking on my door so soon or is that Revelation hitting a paper image of me with his slippers outside the temple?<br>I am cursed!<br><br>Yours forever...<br>Hata-san<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>
