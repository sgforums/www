            <div class='col-md body'>Well, Keegan had to quit because he was going to face angry crowds. And he was stubborn not to stick with the 4-5-1 formation that was so successful against France, and went on to the 4-4-2 and then 3-5-2 formation. These formations caused some confusion among the players, so the main bulk of the error was due to the wrong tactics used, and of course the sleepy head Seaman lah. The game vs Finland, another difficult game with fantastic recent form. I fear for England yet again.<br><br>Right now, Howard Wilkinson is temporarily in charge of the team (like there is any surprise). Terry Venables is the hottest pick to fill up the seat of National Coach as he is the one with most success so far as coach, but there is recent speculations that the next coach will not be English, with Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger highly pipped for the job. John Gregory, Peter Taylor, Peter Reid and Bryan Robson are also candidates speculated.<br><br>Your guess???

The second French candidate, Aime Jacquet, has already ruled himself out of the job. So did local favourites Peter Reid and Peter Taylor. Marcello Lippi, who has just been sacked in Inter, has very low chances too. It would take more to pry Bobby Robson from Boro too. So this time, it is anyone's guess.
