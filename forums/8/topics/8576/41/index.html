Everything got content one leh......dunt pray pray. The 3 goalies selected for Italy will surely be David James, David Seaman and Richard Wright with Nigel Martyn out on injury for quite a few weeks. Taylor promised to use the youths, and with Richard Wright somewhat lacking maturity on the international level, I guess David James is the most obvious choice, and his dedication this time round is for all to see.<br><br>Maestro, errr......not so desperate yet lah, can take ur time.<br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>
