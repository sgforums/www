            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote> Arbiter, that is where you are wrong. That is precisely the role of an air traffic controller, to babysit the pilot. There are quite a number of positions in the tower itself. From the start up of the airplane, to the taxing of airplane, all these are not within the scope of the AIR traffic controller. The main duty of the air traffic controller is basically to ensure the runway is clear for takeoff, to coordinate with other agencies (I think this part is confidential), and honestly, it is very very seldom you have jumbo jets holding at a pattern in an aerodrome. If that happens, it will be a major major screw up on the controller's part. But I have yet to point out the rest of the members of the tower crew, which I guess I am not at liberty to say. But I think you get my point. The Air Traffic Controller has as major a part to play in this as well as the pilot and co-pilots. The careers of those in the tower and those in the cockpits are basically ruined. I guess I should put the full stop here. </blockquote>Think I put what I just said here. Should be better. Only one person to discuss there but more people to discuss here.<br><br>Anyway, the Taiwanese controllers have as much responsibility to shoulder as the pilot. That is basically what I wrote above. However, negligience or not, the pilots and co-pilots can never go scot-free because it is their responsibility to ensure the safety of the plane and its passengers. They don't get paid so much for nothing.<br><br>Two things pointed out by my Sparkle dearest. Firstly, it is not the responsibility of the China Airlines pilots to do any notification, although they could do it. There is a particular frequency whereby they could do it. But it is not their responsibility. Secondly, Sparkle, an Air Traffic Controller can never give take-off clearances if he can't even see the airplane nor the runway. It is just ridiculous. If that is the case, we can put a monkey and expect him to do exactly the same, am I not wrong??? He gets paid that much an amount of money for a reason too you know.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Inzaghi bro, it is not exactly thaaaat tough for England to catch up with Germany. Germany, although catching up on form, can't exactly win all its games, and there is always the dark horses like Finland that will ruin the day for Germany. England has basically played the tough matches, and now it is up to the easy ones (not counting the showdown in Germany). Eriksson should be able to bring England to World Cup 2004 if he register wins in the next 3 games before he officially takes over. That means he really needs to be released by Lazio in order to ensure he doesnt have an uphill task of doing Mission Impossible. England is an underachiever, like China is the sleeping dragon. Once England's full potential is let out, it will be a power to be reckoned with. Kevin Keegan basically does his tactics the way I played Championship Manager, very unprofessionally, and not based on clear strategies. Eriksson can change that, and hopefully, he will succeed. I will still be here in 2004 and will definitely be rooting for England.<br><br>And Inzaghi bro, Sparkle bad girl must scold her what. She good girl anyone will have things to say to her meh??? hehehe......<br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well for the case of the of share holders i dont think i am at all concern. No matter wat SIA still have the safest record. I pretty mad at the taiwan press for pointing their fingers so soon .... they trying to rid themself of resposibility, I think they should close down the airport for not having the radar the track the plane. wat abt the chinese pilot who saw the plane go on the wrong track, shouldnt they report to the tower and the accident will not happen....<br><br>they can blame everyone but the fact is that the accident had taken place and not amount of finger pointing can bring back the lives of the 81 person on board</div>
