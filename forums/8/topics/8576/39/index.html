            <div class='col-md body'>The crash looks pretty bad. 79 dead so far. Tsk tsk tsk, and a meagre 25,000 big ones for compensation. Not a lot actually. Sighz.....<br><br>FnU, if I were to have my choice, I wouldn't choose Eriksson, for one, a good club manager might not be a good national coach. One important fact remains, he is a Swede, not an English, and he has not managed an English club before (he almost managed Blackburn though). With such powerful crudentials behind him, he is seen by many as the best man for the job. I hope too, that he will succeed as English manager. At least rooting for him is better than rooting for what's that guy's name in charge of the Lions? However, he faces an uphill task of bringing England to the World Cup, and with a history of bringing about radical changes of which short-term success will almost certainly be compromised, many would definitely take the opportunity of jumping on him, and proving Adam Crouzier and gang wrong, making them rethink their decision that they should have made crowd favourite Terry Venables the man instead.<br><br>PacMan, I think your no updates is the stock situation issit??? Too bad I don't buy any SIA shares. Don't intend to buy also, so no updates from me lah. But Moose and Inzaghi bro will up down up down for you lah, so no worries okie?? Hahaha......<br><br>Inzaghi bro, my Sparkle dear where got ignore me one??? I said before already what, don't mind her keeping a pet moose as long as she feeds the moose on time and keep me out of it. And she especially has fetishes for mooses with naval uniforms. So no choice lah, hor Sparkle???<br><br>Sparkle, mooses who sail around are the most attractive one, hor...... *bleah*, hehehe<br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>

Do you know that lots of English people actually favour Terry Venables and he is actually most qualified at the moment (apart from Bobby Robson, he guided England to semi finals in Euro96). So he had actually won quite a number of hearts in England, and has lots of respect. If not for the fact of his scandal which makes him unpopular with the top few FA people, he would definitely have been the next England big boss without fail.<br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>

Runways not in use are supposed to be blocked, obstructions higher than certain heights must have warning lights, lots more precautionary steps which the Taiwanese controllers did not do. But I have still no idea how the hell did the Captain go to the wrong runway.<br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rev:<br>ya, he may not exhibit any knowledge about english football...but soccer has no language barriers, i think with his experience (although not in the international stage(, he should be the right choice, at least i really hope so... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>as to why the pilot chose the wrong runway..okie, we both drive right, so imagine in the point of the driver..this is my analyse..the weather was bad, when he turn right towards both runway, the further runway (5L which is the correct one) light will be very dim or cannot see due to poor weather, as the light in 5R which is the wrong runway was on and he is approaching that runway first, he may mistaken that as the correct runway...<br><br>actually they're quite unlucky too, if the renovation has been slightly further, nothing will happen..the 747-400 is a mega top, need more distance to pick up spped to take off.....so, kanna lor... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hahaha, Moose, blame Sparkle, she big culprit, not me.<br><br>Inzaghi bro, Eriksson for your info speaks English. There is no language barrier here. It is just that when with his entire soccer career centred in Sweden, Portugal and Italy, he had absolutely no knowledge of anything about English soccer, the style, the players (apart from the occasional mention of the Shearers and Owens). Hopefully, from now til July, he would be able to catch up on this, and convince his critics that he is the right choice, for there is no scope for failure in this case. Eriksson simply cannot afford any hiccups here.<br><br>In terms of the incident, first problem, the faulty runway should never have been lit up in the first place. Even the taxiways are lit up in different lightings, so a faulty runway lit??? That is misleading. Second, there should be luminous barriers barracading the accesses to the runway. Thirdly, the cranework and everything, apart from being NOTAMed, should also be lit with red lights to warn pilots. All these are standard SOPs, which have not been conformed to. So when it comes to finger pointing, I guess both the pilot and the Air Traffic Controller cannot run away from things. But reports were true, what were the co-pilots doing??? Sighz...... complacency was their biggest enemy.<br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh yah, just read the other thread. Didn't reply there since the focus is different. But for commercial controls, clearance for the runway is usually given before the plane is taxied unto the runway itself. That answers one question. There are no such thing as ground radar. Everything is via visual on the ground. But visibility of the Air Traffic Controller can't go below a certain level such that the controller can't see the plane. With so many people in the control tower, (can't name all, I think this is classified), I am appalled that no one gave an abort take-off command when it was realised the wrong runway was being used. Contrary to what some people think, I feel that this is something we should take notice of. Firstly, it is a national disaster with so many deaths. Secondly, SIA is a form of national pride and it's failure reflects badly on Singapore as a whole. And forgot who mentioned, pointers must be taken from this disaster to ensure that this won't happen a second time. Oh well, to those who can't be bothered, don't be. It is all up to the individual.

So many factors seem to have contributed to the crash.
