            <div class='col-md body'>True. The onus to take off is on the pilot, provided weather allows. Air Traffic Controllers are allowed restrictions of wind shear (information is real time for ATC), and it is up to them to advice the pilots. It will definitely depend on the playback to see what information ATC told the pilot. Had such strong wind shear been informed to the pilot, u think singaporean will want to fly meh???? Remember Singapore are reknowned for their 3Ks leh...... Only moments after the crash were meteorological reports provided with regards to the strong winds caused by the incoming Typhoon Xangsane given. From the point of view of a pilot on the ground, u think he can be the judge meh???? The case you said is not applicable for this because planes are able to fly when typhoon activities are near because typhoon activities is only up til certain flight levels.<br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>The black box will be important in the investigation, as it will indicate whether the pilot made his decision under the influence of the most up-to-date weather information. And safety standards will definitely have to be changed. New procedures will be up. There will be immediate changes for safety standards. But the ATC will definitely be heavily criticised if it was found they allowed the take-off despite the knowledge of difficult in-flight situations in the departure route.<br><br>I just realise, you 6 yrs good also what.
