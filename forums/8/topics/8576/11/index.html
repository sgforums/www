            <div class='col-md body'>Maestro, Salas has this unique style of play whereby he does score nice individual goals too. A skilful player himself, he is definitely a goal-getter. About adapting to the style of play, he has done well adapting in Italy, and with Manchester United's attacking type of play, I am sure Salas will not take long to adjust.<br><br>But then again, I think ManU better do something about defence rather than attack. Barthez is pleading for Roche to cross over the straits, but too bad Fergie is not charismatic enough to succeed.

And we have a common interest in soccer, me suaning his fave team that is lah, hehehehe...... so how can I give up this opportunity to do that??? How's my little sweetie pie today??? *wink wink*<br><br>Inzaghi bro, hehehe, win liao lor, blame it on soccernet, tsk tsk tsk...... doubt me somemore, how can it be??? Have I ever brought u inaccurate soccernews??? Sighz..... well, don't worry lah, latest is that Old Trafford might be reconsidered again afterall, it is just that Villa Park and Anfield are better fields, and it was forseen that four internationals might come from Anfield, that's why. Not to worry not to worry, just because Anfield comes to mind when it comes to internationals first. Hahahaha.......<br><br>colette dear, don't listen to what my bro says, of course u dunt suan me, would u bear to??? *wink wink* kekeke<br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>
