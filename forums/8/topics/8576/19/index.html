So just like it is so unbecoming for ManU to let in 2 goals like that, it is equally unbecoming fro Liverpool to leak in 3 goals like that. I watched a little of the game before going out, and I must say that West Ham played really well..... with Di Canio the master architect of many of their attacking play, but then Liverpool against Southampton.....sighz...... need I say more?? But I am sure Liverpool will bounce back from all these adversities to give a serious championship threat to the rest. So what u do last nite bro??<br><br>Moose, u think Werewolf issit???
