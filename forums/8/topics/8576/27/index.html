Slow and steady, hehe..This number has not much significance to me, but still I would like to make use of this post to express some personal feelingsÂ…<br><br>To me, the net is just another medium of communication between people. Been using it for about 4-5 years. If not for it, I would probably have lost touch with a lot of my friends, including a number of them who are currently studying abroad. I started out using IRC, and that was when I first got addicted to the net, and spent many sleepless nights typing away in front of the screen. Having quit that a couple of years ago (thank goodness!), I found myself a new Â“addictionÂ” in the form of ICQ.  I much prefer ICQ to IRC since itÂ’s more personal, and the people I talk to are mostly personal friends rather than strangers.<br><br>For friendships to start from the net and to develop and be maintained in real life, I think itÂ’s not easy.  Last year, a friend sent me a link to the JCgirls website, and from there, I stumbled upon Sgforums. I have always been more of a reader than a poster. If I remember correctly, I think I only began posting more regularly since the second singles thread, and that is where I began to have a regular exchange of flirting posts with darling Revelations  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">. Not surprisingly, this resulted in us having some kind of relationship that everyone speculated about.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Anyway, through Revelations, I got to meet Qwerty, another fellow forumite, who is now also a close personal friend. Sometimes itÂ’s amazing how friendships are built, and I would say that the greatest reward I got from being a member of this forum is getting to know these two guys. So IÂ’ll like to dedicate this post specially to my toadie darling, Revelations, and to the very unique Qwerty  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">.<br><br>To the other people I know from the forum, I apologise for not mentioning you all. Everyone of you do mean something to me, just that the two of them really do have a special place in my heart. *goosebumps* hehe.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>sparkle<br><br></div>

Hehehehe, being in the forum is fun (only in few selected threads though). And getting to know a few nice forumites, that is more than I can ask for. And hehehehe, Sparkle dear's fun-loving character reflected in here is insignificant to what a pleasant and fun lady friend she is in real life. One of the main reasons, why it is still so difficult to completely quit this forum no matter how much I want to, hehehe...... darling Sparkle, congrats for your 1000th post. *muackx* hehehehe<br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>
