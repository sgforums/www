            <div class='col-md body'>Inzaghi bro, there is nothing I can say...... I mean, being a voluptious babe doesn't guarantee appropriate mannerism and adequate intellect (I mean, look at Baywatch, those babes got the b**bs, but do they have the brains???) So trust me lah, pretty as she is (actually I don't really think she is lah), she is not suitable for u.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Trust me, I'm your bro......<br><br>And well, of course my deeds don't warrant me as an anti-ManU fan, I mean, I could have gone around stabbing ManU fans rite??? But then, these are only the typical stuff the ManUreans do themselves, so I shan't associate myself with them, ehhehe......<br><br>And let's see about losing five matches in a row. Liverpool has got available their all reliable Fowler, Owen, Heskey and co. in attack, and the formidable likes of Babbel and very soon, Ziege, to join the formidable back four. Quality??? I don't think Liverpool lacks any. However, let's take a look at ManU. At attack, well, no arguments, Cole and Yorke are formidable upfront (even though Cole misses more than he scores), but the defence is very very questionable, with the likes of the Neville brothers (so unreliable, can be seen further in the Euro Cup), and Jaap Stam (duh, he looks like a block head), and whoever the other first team defender u consider first team lah..... hehehe.....and how about the highly rated goalkeeper in Barthez??? Who let in 3 (*gasp!!!*) goals on his debut??? Not a perfect start I can see. And look at the fixtures, let's see now, Chelsea first, who has a history of hantaming the Manures until jialat jialat, and next in line??? Oh gosh, Arsenal, with Ljunberg available (has not failed to score a goal against ManU yet)...... so talk about probability, I am sure with accountings you do statistics, and these are simple calculations of odds of things happening, and I am sure that you are more than capable of doing those calculations eh??? Hehehehe...... oh gosh, I talk so much, hahahaha...... but whatever it is Inzaghi bro, you are still my bro, hehehehe (except between the first and final whistle lah)<br><br>Muahahahaha, so let's await the anhilation of the Manures.......<br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>HmmmÂ…IÂ’m tired of talking about Miss Hui and Miss Tan. Change topic shall we? How about you guys play my aunt agony for once? HereÂ’s how the story goesÂ…<br><br>Today, I met a friend at the MRT station. We were in the same classes before, and are on friendly terms, except that our friendship is only contained within campus. He asked if I was going to meet my bf for dinner, not knowing that IÂ’ve long regained my single status, which I told him so. Our conversation didnÂ’t last long, coz his train arrived very quickly. My train came not long after, and less than a min or so after boarding the train, I received an SMS message from him, asking if I wanna go disco with him and his friends someday (and he even indicated that he has no evil intentionsÂ…which I find pretty amusing.). I was surprised at his invitation coz as IÂ’ve said, so far our friendship has always been limited to within the school compounds, and yet the moment I told him that IÂ’m single, I get an invitationÂ….HeÂ’s a friendly guy, and already has a gf, so what I suspect is that heÂ’s probably trying to match make me with his guy friends. What do you all think? Would like to hear the guysÂ’ point of view. And are you guys always so kind and eager to help your friends find partners? I have another friend whom I seldom see online, yet everytime I see him online, heÂ’ll be busy promoting his friend to me. People donÂ’t seem to believe me when I say IÂ’m fine being single, and some would busy themselves with telling me things like how I would be able to find lots of eligible guys when I start working (yeah rite, all the cute looking guys would have been taken up by then, heh  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">). Is it that tough to imagine that someone actually enjoys being single? Of coz I know that IÂ’d probably get sick and tired of being single one day, but whatever it is, IÂ’m happy now. Someone says that if I dun get one now, by the time I get sick of being single, there wonÂ’t be any guys left for me. Quite true, but so what? So I have to get a guy now just in case I canÂ’t find one later on? Waa..sorry, IÂ’m a bit disgusted with myself for posting all these stuffÂ… I sound like an old spinster whining away..hahahaÂ…Â….whateverÂ…sianzÂ…Â…<br><br>I think I like this betterÂ…Revey!! I want a hugÂ…..heheheheheheÂ….<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Sparkle,<br><br>Let me just offer u what I think about the issue. Actually it is up to you whether u want to go for these outings. I am sure that the guys are just trying to help their friends out by introducing them to you. It is up to you whether u can allow a new guy to come into your life, when u are tired of being single. If u are happy about being single, then knowing a few more friends would be okay, and if these guys try to make advances, just tell them that you are not interested.<br><br>Well, some friends asked me about the same thing the last 2 days as well. One of my friends was asking why I don't go after this gal and that gal, and even ask me whether I am interested in meeting another gal... I just tell them that I am okay with being single. Besides, it takes two to tango. If people are not interested in me, I would not bother to do anything. Though sometimes I yearned for the caresses and kisses, but I guess that it's okay for the time being...<br><br>*joking mode on*<br><br>Well, why bother to let those guys date u, while the most eligible bachelor (me) here can be a better date?<br><br>Hahahahahhahahahhahahahahah<br><br>*joking mode off*<br><br>*Prodigal gives Sparkle a good friendship hug*<br><br>Have a good day.<br><br>yours sincerely,<br>Prodigal<br><br>------------------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights. However, love is not about finding someone to relieve you, but love is about you devoting your heart and soul to love that someone, even if you know that someone do not love you the way you do."<br>- Prodigal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sparkle:<br>well, it is sometime considered social manners to invite a gal to some form of group party, if u're uncomfortable with it, u can just say NO!!!!..but of cos, if u're single, they may like u to meet up with more friends, its very natural, dun take it negatively..it is no harm in getting to know more pple, pls be reminded that u need lotsa friends in this working society..<br>guys as well as gals, we wish that our friends will get a good partner, that's why there is the so called match making...but who knows u may find ur Miss or Mr Right there!!!!<br>it is true that good things will be snatched up early, but we mustn't fall into an illusion that we must also be fighting for sometime if we're not prepared....being single is not lousy, just that we're not prepared to commit to a relationship...but because u want to stay single and hence not meet up with new pple, that this is very stupid indeed...<br><br>so what do u think, my sis!!!</div>
