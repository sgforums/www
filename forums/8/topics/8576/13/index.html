Well, if you study beside me, sure cannot concentrate one, thatÂ’s for sure, but only for the simple reason that IÂ’m so slack that youÂ’ll get influenced by me. One of my friend likes to call me up when sheÂ’s lagging behind and canÂ’t finish her work, coz she knows that sheÂ’ll feel better after finding out that IÂ’m also doing last min work..heheÂ…<br><br>Proddy, yup thanks for the drinks. Revey, you r horrible lah, told you that youÂ’re driving so dun drink too much, and what did you tell me? That itÂ’s nothing to you?

            <div class='col-md body'>To my most worshipped Goddess,<br><br>My Goddess, have I not being sincere and loyal enough? Have I not shown my devotion and love more than anybody else has? Did I not love you more than my life itself? Why have you forsaken me and destroy all my dreams and hopes? All this question I need to have answered, for I envision a long night of numerous nightmare and bleak existence.<br><br>At the risk of sounding most politically incorrect, I will have you know that I do not treat your marriage as legal binding! It is not legal binding in the sense that such agreement between you and your husband will not deter me from wooing you and coming in between you and him! Love is definitely selfish and I swear on my fatherÂ’s grave that I love you more than he does you! I will not believe that my selfless dedication cannot touch the stony cold heart of yours.<br><br>I will chase you from one end of the earth to another. I will serenade you under the cold shower of Paris, the sunny sky of the Caribbean seas and the wild night of Rio de Janeiro. I promise you this and more. My most worshipped Goddess, I am mystified! Am I not the more worthy of your love than your husband is? Have I not proven that my love for you is as deep as the blue sea?<br><br>I hate to measure my love for you in the cold paper of statistics but I feared I must resort to this method to convince you that I am the one for you. Who is the one calling you every night? Who is the one there for you when you are at your most lonely? Who is the one who rushes down from the East all the way to your house when you told me you were feeling bored and depress? Who is the one you feel most comfortable with? Who is the one who abandons his essay to a D grade so he can accompany you to the clubs during the weekends? I can go on and go my most beloved Goddess, but I know there is one thing I can never measured up to your husband. He is rich and successful. I am neitherÂ…I am just a poor worshipper who needs to beg for incense outside your temple, while he can afford to built 7 pagodas for you at his whim. All I know is that my heart is worth more than all the diamonds in South Africa and gold in Ukraine. And if this is not enoughÂ…I have no more hope left in this world.<br><br>I canÂ’t go on anymore. The news of your marriage has shattered my heart beyond recognition. My keyboard is getting wetÂ…and I am late for school. But what is school, when I donÂ’t have youÂ….<br><br>I loved you Goddess.<br>Yours, then, now and forevermore,<br>Hata-san<br><br>"the pursuit of truth and beauty is a sphere of activity in which we are permitted to REMAIN CHILDREN all our lives"<br>~ albert einstein<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>

Liverpool did well also what, although didnt watch the match, but I am sure the new Nike ball had some part to do in there not being more goals scored. Arsenal vs Liverpool, I predict Liverpool to win by a single goal. And onz.....let's go to the ManU shop someday together...... we can have coffee around there too......<br><br>Moose, u dunno XXX meh??? Tsk tsk tsk, even I noe, hahahaha<br><br>Tet *gasp* married???
