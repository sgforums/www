Wenger said he won't py that kinda $$$ for Wiltord...so we shall see if he honour his words or not....<br><br>well its always tough in a new season, no matter what other teams did in the off season...yes, this is rather tough for my team, considering we haven't manage to buy a big name apart from Barthez...but whether is he good enough or not, well he is proven in the international level, shouldn't be a big deal if he let in goals in those matches!!!! when u got a better understanding with his defenders, he will play better...<br><br>anyway, me tonight going to the Man Utd pub for dinner....will tell u how is the feeling to be there!!!! oh i forgot, Liverpool will never have one in SG, cos they're just toooo broke!!!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Inzaghi bro, tok cok lah, hehehehe, no use a club being sooooo rich when the people in the board are soooooo stingy..... well, at least Liverpool was willing to spend, and I'm sure their investments will be well worth it.<br><br>And opening a Liverpool shop you were saying??? Well, there are the pros definitely with opening an ManU shop, afterall, with the support for ManUnited dwindling, u really need such stuff to perk up the support for the team. A good place to visit for all ManU trashers too, hehehehe...... The feeling, hmm..... someday I must go too, you accompany me lah, then when I gena beaten up you bail me out yah??? hahahaha.......<br><br>The deputy director or dunno whatsisname has gone to France to discuss the deal already. Wiltord's heart is no longer in France, so I guess the deal will be a go ahead. Don't worry, this Wiltord thingie won't be a repeat of the Van Nisterooy saga...... tsk tsk tsk, what were they thinking???<br><br>By the way, I heard rumours that Fergie might be signing Van Nisterooy next April at a much much much reduced price...... how true is this u noe???<br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Sparkle,<br><br>I feared I had not the good fortune to be your Andy Lau although I must admit, with a tinge of embarrassment, that he used to be my idol. Who can resist his charming looks and killer stares? And I must confess again, with an even redder face, that I had an even bigger crush on Rosamund Kwan since I was a youth and to chance upon her first movie with Andy Lau. Such porcelain face, such grace lined with feminine musk...to be complimented with a slender figure that set many a testosterone racing. Ah, such is the fervour of youthful dreams.<br><br>And my dear lady, you make my dream came true again. Never in my wildest dream do I dare...yes, dare to dream that a living goddess from the silver screen would appear in the flesh, right in front of me. And shaking my hand with a coy smile! If not for the high chair behind me, surely I will faint!<br><br>Of course, many an infatuations are usually accompanied by exaggerations. But my dear lady, I dread that my words will do you injustice. Nothing can possibly describe the earth shattering experience you had on me. Mon ami, I am surprised that the lights and music did not stop at the arrival of such beauty...surely they know that a goddess is among us tonight!<br><br>As much as I am an ardent admirer of your beauty, I fear I must decline the honour of being your Andy Lau. Alas, Heaven does make sports of man...you chanced upon my life too late. For simply the fact that my heart is taken.<br>I aspire to be Tanaka Misato's Takenouchi Yutaka, to be tetrutetrumon's hata-san. After all, my appearance in this thread is homage to her.<br><br>However, I must admit last evening was a very special night for me. For at long last, Rosamund Kwan appears once again in front of me. My dearest lady, you made my night.<br><br>Forever yours,<br>hata-san<br><br>Ugly is not a sin...I am goddamm proud to be among the uglies! - James<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>

Heheheh.....<br><br>And aiyoh Hata-san, enuff of humility lah, hahaha<br><br>Sparkle dear, me your Andy Lau??? Hahahaha, can can, in fact, I can be a different person for you everyday. Just like you look like a brand new beauty to me everyday.

            <div class='col-md body'>My dearest friend, I believed you know which "catergory" my dear friend CoCo is. And trust me, using beautiful to describe CoCo and sparkle will be doing them an injustice. After all, Hello Kitty always proclaimed herself as beautiful, abet in another dialect. Now that would be a horror, putting the 2 goddess in the company of a stray cat.<br><br>dear friend, treasure your time with sparkle. Such girls do not pop into your life that frequently and do grab it with your fist held tight!<br>And by the way, my god, i look like Jack by the bean stalk when i stand next to you! Nobody told me you were a manhunt potential!?!? You effectively ruined me and prodigal's mood last night!!!<br><br>Ugly is not a sin...I am goddamm proud to be among the uglies! - James<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear sparkle,<br><br>Sigh. We are simply not meant for one another sparkle. I worship the ground Rosamund Kuan walked on and Yutaka Takenouchi is the guy you wish to lock lips with and if this is not fate, I proclaim the world to be a very dead and dull world! We have the fate to bump into one another but ah, destiny is something that will elude us in the near future.<br><br>As for my compliments, take it in your stride. I feared I have not done you justice with my praise! Such beauty, you simply took my breath awayÂ…please forgive me if I called you goddess in future. My Goddess is a very jealous god and she forbade her worshippers to give praise to another idol. However, I am sure she will not begrudge me if I acknowledge the presence of another goddess. After all, She in all her infinite wisdom knows that her slavish follower here will never dare lay another incense on another altar.<br><br>Sometimes my darling, I wonder how far we missed out on meeting one another. We studied in the same school and our faculties are just next to one another. I shuddered with pleasure knowing that I might have been sitting behind you in bus 151 on the long silent journey to school. I loved to hang at the cafÃ© near the forum, watching the BA students hurried on their way to the education of making more money out of us poor proletariats. And it set my mind thinking if I have missed out on you too, when my head is bend down towards my espresso. So near and yet so farÂ…<br><br>If we had met earlier, would I have the courage to pursue you like I did for my namesake? I wonder long and hard. After all, one does not bump into a goddess (especially one he worship since his youth) that often in his life. Would I have abandon my cautious nature and jump from my seat in the cafÃ©, running close to you and stop you in your track. And asking you in a breathless voice, Â“Where have you been all my life goddess?Â” Ah, and most likely be the first guy in the forum to be slapped by a gal.<br><br>I can go on and on about how close we were to one another darling, but that would defeat the purpose right? I rather fall back on those what-if scenarios and console myself every night that life would definitely taken a much more interesting turn if I had chanced upon you earlier.<br><br>If you are a fan of Yutaka, you must have seen his show With Love. And his net romance and the countless times they miss one another. Girls are not the only die-hard romantics around, I am a romantic too! I too, waited for a woman to sweep me off my feet and have the most fiery and passionate hunting season with her, me devoting my energy and effort to bag that lovely doe. My dear darling, I am sadden that I do not have the opportunity to chase you like Zeus chasing the lovely goddess Danae. All I have is regret at not knowing you earlier.<br><br>Forever yours,<br>Hata-san<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>
