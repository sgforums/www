            <div class='col-md body'>FnU, no lah, Lazio has made a bid for McManaman, but McManaman has not agreed to Lazio yet. With my guts feel, I think that McManaman might just switch to Middlesbrough instead. Only at Middlesbrough will he be able to hold down a regular first place rather than Lazio. And next reason, he already spent one year learning Spanish. Now he has to start all over again with Italian??<br>Barcelona might not be the team it used to be, but that doesn't mean it is any less formidable. In the place of Zenden and Ron De Boer, is Emmanuel Petit and Marc Overmars. No signs of Frank De Boer being unhappy though, and he still has an important role in defence for Barcelona. Already proven in Arsenal, they will have a big impact on Barcelona's style of play. And if Patrick Vieira is going to move anyway, I guess Barcelona would be the place too. Too bad Zenden is not going to Chelsea.<br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>

Without your sparkle, how can a shattered heart bring about another bright pair of eyes???<br><br>How can there be hostily and nonchalance from yours truly??? How can our distance be drifting further and further??? Sighz...... could it be...... could it be...... could it be that u have found another Daniel??? No, no, no, I refuse to believe that. That is simply not possible. *Soooobbbb*<br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Inzaghi bro, Macca's career will not be gone if he goes to Boro. Imagine the likes of internationals like Ince, Boksic, Karembeau, Schwarzer, and a lot of other worthy players. All they need is a good playmaker, one which Macca can provide. To Lazio, well, I just think that he might not be as well used as in Boro, where his spark of ingenuity might be restricted by the company of equally reknowned stars.<br><br>By the way, ManU's group is not at all that tricky what. The only trick is that between now rivals PSV and ManU. Should be interesting to watch that match. But ManU is the favourites to emerge top from that group.<br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rev, you are rite, itÂ’s simply not possible for me to have found another Daniel. The only Daniel I will ever accept into my heart is you. You are the only one who can put up with my unreasonable requests, my wilful nature, my bad temper, my sudden bouts of insecurities and insanity. The reason for all these is simply to get your attention. I crave for attention, not from anyone else, but from you. But IÂ’m getting weary, weary of having to try to put up a stoic front in front of you, but not succeeding at all. One of these days, youÂ’ll find me unbearable, and I do not wish for that time to come when my love for someone manifests itself as a form of nuisance to that someoneÂ….<br><br></div>
