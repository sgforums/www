            <div class='col-md body'>Wahlau Inzaghi bro, making out in your own room is only for married couples. But it would be a different feeling if someone else come make out in your room. Hahaha...... but not to worry, Hotel 81 is not my cup of tea. I'd rather save up for Ritz or something like that. In the meantime, no need to abstain. All you need is to put on ur thinking cap, singapore so many places, dunneed me to teach lah hor, hehehe......<br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hahaha, Inzaghi bro, Juventus no choice lah. 2 red cards, and one of them belongs to a goalie, somemore two matches with 2 red cards, how to qualify??? Anyway, Liverpool is through in the UEFA cup. Too bad Celtic can't get through too. Feel for that poor guy. They were leading. But now with all 3 clubs reaching the second round, an extra slot will be allocated to England, meaning likelihood of Liverpool qualifying is greater. Hope Berger's injury won't hamper anything. He has done well for the team.<br><br>How do you feel about the new English squad?? Surprise entries into the squad.<br><br>England squad: Anderton (Tottenham), Ball (Everton), Barmby (Liverpool), Barry (Aston Villa), Beckham (Man Utd, capt), Brown (Man Utd), Butt (Man Utd), Carragher (Liverpool), Dyer (Newcastle), R Ferdinand (West Ham), Fowler (Liverpool), Gerrard (Liverpool), Heskey (Liverpool), James (Aston Villa), Johnson (Derby), Lampard (West Ham), G Neville (Man Utd), P Neville (Man Utd), Owen (Liverpool), Parlour (Arsenal), Phillips (Sunderland), Robinson (Leeds), Scholes (Man Utd), Smith (Leeds), Southgate (Aston Villa), Wright (Ipswich)<br><br>And I doubt Leeds will progress to the next round. It has been grouped together with Lazio and Real Madrid. Yet another Italian-Spanish pair. Doubt Leeds will be second time lucky.<br><br>Anyway, for the pairings for Champions League.<br><br>Group A<br>Valenica, Sturm Graz, Man Utd, Panathinaikos.<br><br>Group B<br>Milan, Deportivo La Coruna, Paris St Germain, Galatasaray.<br><br>Group C<br>Bayern Munich, Arsenal, Spartak Moscow, Lyon.<br><br>Group D<br>Real Madrid, Anderlecht, SS Lazio, Leeds.<br><br>Manchester United looks likely to go through. Arsenal, slightly more tricky, but hopefully will go through also. Leeds, give up. Anyway, I say Liverpool has got chance of lifting the UEFA trophy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Berger would be out for 6 months estimate. and well, he was an important player, but as reports say, there is always gerrard, murphy or barmby to cover him, so shouldnt be much of a problem.<br><br>Sad to say. You are right. Liverpool's chances of lifting the cup this time round is slim with Barcelona's inclusion. Hopefully they will be trashed out. They were favourites to go to the second round before Leeds beat them to it, remember?? The ball is round. And Owen is on form. Remember his 30 seconds feat.<br><br>Sad to say, but chances of ManU progressing is very high.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hahahah, Inzaghi bro, that's the difference you see??? Man U will only have chance if all the top players of Liverpool gets injured. While Liverpool will just take anything that comes at them.<br><br>And did you see the match of ManU?? A second round place was only decided on the final minutes. So risky.
