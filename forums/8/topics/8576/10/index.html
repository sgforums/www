            <div class='col-md body'>Yeap, it would be good if Salas went to ManU, then it would make beating ManU more satisfying. I mean, of the last two matches, ManU only managed to score a miserable 1 goal through Fortune, even though the likes of Cole, Yorke, Solksjaer, Sheringham, Keane, Beckham, Scholes, have all been played throughout. With this 3-0 scoreline that Chile won, I guess Fergie will be very very attracted. But I think he promised Sheringham that there will be no more strikers this season. Let's see if he keeps his promise.<br><br>Well, Redondo is a crowd puller, causing great uproar when Real Madrid decided to sell him, and well, Macca won't be coming back to EPL, so forget about him yah???? Yeap, Del Piero and Inzaghi could make the other two, but lots of legible people as well, hehehe, I'm toking about Del Piero lah, my Inzaghi kor is definitely in.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Sparkle, how can I sleep early without that simple goodbye by you???

My question to you is how long will sala perform in Man U should he join Man U. I think is the style that Man U play, they dont really play with a out and out striker, but relies more on the flank to break open the defends...... their goals are spread among all their players...which is good , so if the main scorers is down some 1 can step up to take up the task of goal scoring<br><br></div>
