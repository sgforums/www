            <div class='col-md body'>Sparkle dearie, awww...... u were studying so hard for your test that my heart just hurts thinking of it. You should have told me when you were feeling sleepy. I would have gone by your side to give you the wake up massage that I recently learnt, and make warm cocoa for you to keep you awake while giving you the moral support by your side. Behind every successful woman is a nice guy, rite??? kekeke *wink wink*<br><br>colette dearie, now now, no need to feel inferior in any way. Have you realised that from the start of everything til now, you were the only one that I have termed the flirtatious beauty??? No one deserves this title more than you dear, my flirtatious one *wink*<br><br>Moose, well, if Maya doesn't know how a moosette is supposed to be like, well, maybe you can have the honour of giving her the personal coaching yah??? Maya rite??? *wink*<br><br>Ouch, my eyes keep winking tonight, hahahaha<br><br>Inzaghi bro!!!! I am awaiting my coffee. The most lethal strike partnership didn't score a single goal. Gosh. And even if I gave you one ball, it still wouldn't make up for the 2-0 trashing that ManU suffered.......gosh!! What am I to say??? To suffer a goal by Hasseilbank is understandable, but by a defender who doesn't even have regular first team placing??? Who is always placed under pressure by the Yorke and Cole duo??? Oh dear, after being terrorised by four different strikers, he could still go ahead and score a goal???? *shake head*<br>And oh dear, some ManU player just couldn't play professionally rite?? hahahaha......too bad he saw red yah??? *wink*<br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>

Omigosh, what do I see??? And I didn't think the chemistry for Chelsea was there. Remember what I told you about the 3-1 defeat earlier??? Omigosh, that followed by a 2-0 defeat yet again. And...... oh gosh, it is that famous bald headed Barthez again???

            <div class='col-md body'>Inzaghi bro, hehehehe, okay, so I got the facts wrong, only got to sleep two hours last nite, so dunt expect too much from me lah. But well, no teams have ever won the EPL three times in the row, and I doubt Manchester United will be able to do it this time. And I don't know, 5 goals in 2 games seems quite a lot for a world class goalkeeper like Barthez. Hmm...... how huh...... a repeat of Mark Bosnich??? *ponder ponder* And well, Babbel has been a powerhouse in the Liverpool defence, with Ziege also available (remember the Ziege vs Beckham and Gary Neville battle?), I dunno if what you said will hold true. Not a fan of the German attack though.<br><br>Coffee tonight cannot lah, me got appointment tonight *wink wink Sparkle* hahahaha, not the next three days also, fully booked too *double wink wink Sparkle*, so leaves Friday thru to the weekends  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Which day u free???  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Sparkle dear, well, disregard the term flirtatious and that is what you are. You are my one, the one and only, and if you wish, I will make cocoa for you everyday, even if you don't have an tests.
