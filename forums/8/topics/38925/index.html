            <div class='col-md body'><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/infostructure/0,1377,58143,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.wired.com/news/infostructure/0,1377,58143,00.html</a><br><br><strong>War Worms Inch Across Internet </strong><br><br>02:00 AM Mar. 21, 2003 PT<br><br>The U.S. military action in Iraq has stirred up computer virus writers and malicious hackers, who have apparently decided to vent by defacing websites and releasing e-mail worms that prey on people's fears and curiosity.<br><br>Antagonists and activists based in the United States, Europe and the Middle East are engaged in their own form of war games. Some are vandalizing websites, particularly government sites, scrawling scornful cybergraffiti or urging people to "make love not war."<br><br>And at least three e-mail viruses that their authors claim were released in response to the war have started making rounds on the Net.<br><br>Website defacements don't normally cause problems for anyone but those in charge of the altered sites. And for most people the war-related e-mail viruses, which don't yet seem to be in wide circulation, are nothing more than an annoyance.<br><br>But relatives of military personnel involved in the war in Iraq said malicious code lurking in their inboxes is the last thing they need to copes212 with right now.<br><br>"My husband had been e-mailing me every day, (but) the messages stopped on Tuesday," said Marilyn Montero, a military wife who lives in Southern California. "Very late yesterday I got an e-mail that said it had pictures attached of what happened in Iraq last night. I'm stupid with worry now and I opened it.<br><br>"It screwed up my computer, and now I can't get e-mail or check news sites until my brother comes over to fix it. E-mail from my husband was the one thing that was keeping me going. I hope the idiot who made this virus has a really horrible day."<br><br>Regina Scalone from New York, whose cousin is stationed on an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf, also got whacked with a war worm.<br><br>"I'm not an idiot, but everything I know about computers went out the window when the war started," Scalone said. "I'm so frantic to find out what's happening over there. So I opened an attachment that was labeled 'Go USA,' and my computer locked up.<br><br>"I've been told tricks like this, playing off people's worries, are called social engineering by hackers," Scalone added. "Well, this seems pretty goddamn antisocial to me."<br><br>Social engineering refers to the use of psychological tricks to encourage people to do things they might not normally do. Virus writers often include messages tied to current concerns like war, or eternal human urges like lust, to get people to open infected e-mail attachments.<br><br>So far, the war-related worm in widest circulation is Ganda, the one that both Scalone and Montero opened. Ganda is currently rated a low threat by most security firms.<br><br>Ganda arrives with one of several different subjects and messages, all with references to the current military action and political situation.<br><br>One variation claims the attachment contains pictures of Iraq taken by U.S. spy satellites; another purports to contain a pro-America screensaver and urges people to display it to show support in the war against terrorism. Others come with messages claiming the attachment is either an anti-George W. Bush or pro-peace screensaver.<br><br>Once the attachments are opened on PCs running Windows, Ganda behaves like many other e-mail worms, e-mailing itself to all the addresses in the infected machine's Outlook contact list. It also scans the machine for security software -- such as McAfee, Norton or Sophos antivirus products -- and shuts them down.<br><br>Ganda's code claims it was written by "Uncle Roger" from HÃµrnsand, Sweden. Oddly, the virus' code also contains this message: "I am being discriminated by the Swedish school system. This is a response to eight long years of discrimination."<br><br>"We don't know what Uncle Roger's problem is with the school system in Sweden," said Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant for Sophos. "But clearly the author of this virus is exploiting an interest in current affairs by deliberately presenting his virus in this way. At a time of international crisis, it is understandable that computer users will be interested in finding out the latest news from the Middle East.<br><br>"Whatever his problem is, a worm is not an appropriate way to complain about it."<br><br>Worms aren't the only war-related Internet irritation. Network security firm F-Secure reported that as of Thursday morning, several hundred U.S. and Middle East websites had been defaced with pro- and anti-war messages.<br><br>Some of the messages are in English, others are in Arabic, said Mikko Hypponen from F-Secure.<br><br>Hypponen said he expects to see more war-related defacements and worms in the next week. He also advised computer users to treat all e-mails containing attachments purporting to contain war-related information with extra skepticism.<br><br>As always, security experts said the best way Internet users can protect themselves is to update antivirus programs regularly, and to stay current with security patches for all software.<br><br>But some who have attempted to keep their programs patched ran into problems earlier this week after applying a critical patch for Windows 2000. The patch made it impossible to reboot their computers.<br><br>Microsoft later announced the patch was incompatible with 12 previous software fixes for Windows 2000 issued between December 2001 and February 2002. Users running any of those fixes won't be able to reboot their Windows 2000 systems after applying the new patch, according to Microsoft.<br><br>"We get slammed when we don't quickly apply the patches, and slammed when we do," said Jeff Kinsel, a systems administrator for a Manhattan publishing firm. "Some days I just hate my job."<br><br></div>
