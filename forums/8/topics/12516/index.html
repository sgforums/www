            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I had a dream.<br><br>I was 30 years older. Standing at our new service balcony, I was admiring what was a refurnished neighborhood. Kids were running in the new playground, young teenagers skateboarding on the new ramp. Palm trees swayed and rustled through the wind, and the new carpet glass was just beginning to grow. The air still smells of new paint. The pavement bears an uncanny resemblance to the red carpet and it leads to my block of flats. The lift now stops on every floor, much to the delight of my wife who had been complaining of rheumatism especially when it rained. Today my daughter will bring her fiancÃ©e home for dinner. A brand new Mercedes pulled over in the parking lot. 12 floors above, I could notice its shine. It was a luxury I never owned.<br><br>Then the doorbell rang. Signs of familiarity. At the door was my daughter, whom I had known for 22 years, and my companyÂ’s strategist, downsizer, manager of operations. The same person who took the position I was expecting to promote to when old Ah Teck retires. Later he would perform a major downsizing operation that will rid the company off deadwoods to create a more dynamic and effective organization. Those were his exact words. I remembered because I was a recipient of one of the retrenchment letters he sent. I known him for 2 years.<br><br>Â“Meet Chris David, my fiancÃ©e. Chris is from Australia and heÂ’s an expatriate. Â” Her voice was distant. Â“Ah Lim my ex colleague.Â” Chris reached out his hand. Flashbacks of scenes in the company races through my mind as I watched his hands extends. The same hands took a position which would rightly be mine, typed the letter that told me to leave, and the same fingers that pointed to the office doors. Now, the same hands will snatch my daughter. I reached out my hands and returned his courtesy.<br><br>Â“Chris and I are getting married. We will then move back to Australia. Chris said his time in Singapore is due, and he wishes to return home. Our home in Australia.Â” For minutes I couldnÂ’t utter a word. Her voices sounded like echoes in the mountains. She was shouting at one end of the cliff, and I was hearing it at the other end, and I couldnÂ’t get any closer. My own daughter, now an expatriateÂ’s wife, an Australian.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was back at work again. It was an improvement from the old job as the assistant manager of operations in a printing firm. At least I was issued free uniforms for this one. A cap, a blue shirt that prints Â“Ah Tan Cleaning ServiceÂ” and matching pants in light blue. My trusty trolley of cleaning gadgets wasnÂ’t around for me to pick up like it usually was. I had pasted my initials Â“IOÂ” on it when I started here so that no one will be mistaken and wheel my trolley away. I spotted my trolley in the distant. It was Krishnan my new colleague. Krishnan starts his day at 6 in the morning. He would wipe all the ledges, empty all the baskets and scrub all the sinks, and when I arrive for work, there were hardly anything left to do. He lives in the company quarters a stone throw from where we worked; he hardly leaves the quarters when we are off work. He sends most of his pay back to his home in Bangladesh every month. It was my trolley, the ledge at the bottom of the left wheel was broken and I had tied it up with a couple of rubber bands so it wouldnÂ’t fall apart. But my initials that I had proudly sticked its handle was gone. Later I learnt that I had to leave this job too. Krishnan was younger, worked better, and most importantly cheaper to hire.<br><br>I was back at the service balcony again. Palm trees still swayed and rustled in the wind. Oblivion to naught, kids were still ramping their skateboards in the new playground, the pavement still bears an uncanny resemblance to the red carpet that leads to my block of flats but I avoided it when I walked today. It was the luxuries dwellers here were bestowed with in exchange for.....What? As the scene fades, I awoke from my dream.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jessie my 2-year-old daughter sound asleep in the other room. There is no service balcony, only a little kitchen and a bathroom that would hardly fit anything more than my wife and our daughter. In the vicinity, old folks were beginning to assemble to start their daily tai chi exercise. My wife was getting ready to join them. I had often laughed at her because she was the youngest among them all. She said she had to start working out now because she could get rheumatism when she grew older if she doesnÂ’t. There are no skateboard ramps. The playground was old; the slides made from concrete instead of plastics, the seesaw of wood instead of rubber and did not have springs under them. But it was ample to provide Jessie with many hours of pleasure. It was there where she took her first step, but it will be my responsibility to lay the paths where she will step into the future.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Kind of sad but i do not think it is just a dream.<br><br>Things are beyong our control and we will become powerless if we continue to be "manipulated" by the authority. Listening and obeying their every call while knowing something is not right. Our next generation would lose their right and identity if they do not wake up but let this dream go on.<br><br>i do agree that expats are attractive but what made the local unattractive? Have you analyzed? How many of our local would be unemployed? And why most expats prefers not to stay here but go back home? How many of our ger would appeal to these expats? How many of them raising their expectation and waiting for their rich foreign prince to appear? And hence, how high would the percent of singlehood shoot up to?<br><br>A service balcony that is too expensively paid for and it is considered the "return of kindness" due to the support to XXX party during the previous election. Is it worth your money?<br><br>I guess the young would not understand what is going on now or worry about what is awaiting them in the future. They would think it is all just a dream and hence wonder what is the morale behind the story. They would only be bothered if they have no money to buy the new PC game that everyone is crazily playing.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Poor (edited 23 October 2001).]</div>
