            <div class='col-md body'>im not a guy but im sure it will definately be an added bonus if the gal knows how to cook well. Although it may be wenxin but imagine as u stay together for some yrs into married life, do you think he will still find it so wenxin? most guys take things for granted. soon they find its your job wat... eat 10mins finish then go watch tv liaos... of cos you love him your willing to cook n feed him well. but wat im trying to say is for guys who get to have a cooking wife will soon take it for granted n feel nothing abt it. But if you dun always cook and only certain days, then diff. on the days you cook, he will look fwd to it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

I understand what you said. Men are ironic creatures and they do not know how contradictory about the things they say. I also get the comment about fat and slim. I don't believe whatever men say anymore. Sometimes I think all of them are programmed to be pathalogical liers.<br><br>Personally, I think some of the things said here are commendable but its idealised and over time, the man will complain about the food and everything and being very ungrateful and the cook will be treated as a "yellow faced auntie". For me, I can cook but see no point start a precedent to be taken as a maid to cook, clean and pay for the groceries for my guy's family, his older siblings and husbands/wives as well as his relatives staying nearby. (his sister is married to a really rich guy) I have to clean up after they eat, they also don't leave you any food nor any clean utensil to use and they freely dispense hurtful critiques about my techniques and how they do not like what I cook (while wolfing everything down)<br><br>I work full time, study part time, have my own family issues, dreams and burden to work out. I do not see any incentive to take on more work and go take care of my bf family with the way they treat me.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>On top of it, I realise that his brother's wife dispised me for cooking cause it made her look bad in front of her mother in law. The mother in law also quite nasty and kept using me as a example for her. She had never got on well with me and she's the type that if she open her mouth, gold will drop. Now, relations is no good and I've noticed of the things she does to get one up. I know she's very close to the mother in law cause she dispise her own mother and she is like a baby making machine so she gets all the good stuff and all the good treatment. I think its all become very unhealthy although I do my part to get expensive herbs and dragon brand concentrated bird's nest for the mother which she finished in 1 day. (Apologies if I feel this way but I think they are very gian png and crass) I do not like competition esp at home but I know my guy would never move out of his home and I have to live with the filthy house with the dog shitting all over the house.<br>Already I am not part of their family. the mother screamed at me several just because of small issue like didn't open letter box and that my cleaning make her house grow ants or that my lap cheong not good enough. Then always treat me like handyman and get me to fix her video, tv, fan and etc. I am a girl leh!

Pardon me for saying this, you seem no better than a maid to them... THey are taking  you for granted.. Gal, you don't deserve this... If you are doing it willingly, then I think that's fine... But don't seem so in this case...<br><br>Last time, I also had a similar prob... My ex bf lives in a mansionatte... His mum used to ask me to wipe the floor for them using a cloth. (It's wiping, not mopping ok?) Imagine carrying a pail of water up the stairs to their rooms, then wipe all the stairs, down to living room again? That's it!! My relationship with my ex grew sour becoz he sided with his mum...  I mean, if we did in out of our own accord, we'll feel more 'gam wan'... But now, it's not.<br><br>I suggest you talk to your bf nicely again...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think many gers got the wrong concept leow. is not whether you know how to cook or not that guys like.<br><br>guys like women who know how to please, know how to make him to come back often and look forward to it. cooking shud nt be the main thing, being thrifty or know how to look out for good deals can please a man very much also more than cooking.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

And if he sides with her then he is in the wrong.<br><br>if you are thinking all the time and stress abt it then your relations are not gd. but if you still ard after all this time means maybe you want this relationship,  but never walk away best you trash it out with him first then decide. Even to the point if you have to fight and quarrel better you say it out than don't say. Never keep anything inside.<br><br>If both of you discuss until quarrel but he willing to listen then there is hope, but instead if keep quiet, keep it to himself and say nothing then he not sincere.</div>
