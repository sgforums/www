But she has got no status in his house.<br><br>but in the eyes of other women in his house like his mother or sister-inlaw, that woman staying with them eating their food using their things is a nobody and a cheap s lut and one that the relatives will make gossip out of.<br><br>My comments may be harsh but it's facts. Cohabitation in the new millenium may be a new thing but it is a deeply rooted 'no no' in our asian culture because of face. Of course they will never respect her and abuse her even make her do all the s hit job in the house. The longer she stays in the house unmarried the more they will despise her.<br><br>So if she has got no status as a wife, of course the son has to side with the mother, what is he going to say to his mother if he was asked 'why he sided with a nobody' do you know the answer to that if your mother asked you that question?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>If the woman is the mans wife, the mother in-law may still try to find fault but she has to know that the son may not side her anymore because the son can "defend" his "wife".<br><br>Do you see the difference?</div>
