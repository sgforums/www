            <div class='col-md body'>Well I feel that most if not all guys tend to  be attracted to this type of stuffs...its a typical male behaviour, and add to that the easy availability of porn online and the lure is too difficult to resist.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Of course I'm not saying that every hot blooded male spends  90% of his time online looking at smut, but it becomes excessive if someone spends hours everyday just looking at/downloading porno pics/mpgs. (i.e. it has turned into an obsession) Thats where the danger lies.<br><br>If this is the first time your boyfren is watching/viewing porno pics online, well it is alright to forgive him for that (c'mon dun tell me there isn't a guy here who hasn't watched/viewed porno pics or films before <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> ), but if he keeps doing it everyday then its time for a serious talk with him. Anyways my view is that it _is_ ok to look at  pornography once in a while (its part of human nature), just make sure it doesn't turn into an obsession. Or perhaps you could channel his interests elsewhere, i.e. engage in other more meaningful activities rather than just going online, where these things are within easy reach.<br><br>------------------<br>The most basic of all human needs is the need to understand and be understood.</div>

Jane, u're too harsh in making yur bf SWEAR abt NOT watching porno. Guys can be easily aroused by visual stimuli.<br><br>Talking abt sex, i believe most fellas here certainly DISAPPROVE on kiddos having sex or whatsoever. I am no exception.<br><br>Youwen, judging from the reply u gave. I can draw a few conclusions from this:<br><br>1) U've a damn conservative thinking and can't accept porn at all.<br><br>2) U're VERY, VERY religious fella and consider yurself as a godly fella who steers clear frm Drinking, Gambling and Vice.<br><br>3) U've been jilted by another gal/fella recently and took it real bad, haven't get over it.<br><br>4) U're still a young 'gina' of abt 14-18 years old who haven't matured in the brain department and try to act smart in this forum!!!!!<br><br>Please lah Youwen, GROW UP!!!!!!!</div>

Jane, u're too harsh in making yur bf SWEAR abt NOT watching porno. Guys can be easily aroused by visual stimuli.<br><br>Talking abt sex, i believe most fellas here certainly DISAPPROVE on kiddos having sex or whatsoever. I am no exception.<br><br>Youwen, judging from the reply u gave. I can draw a few conclusions from this:<br><br>1) U've a damn conservative thinking and can't accept porn at all.<br><br>2) U're VERY, VERY religious fella and consider yurself as a godly fella who steers clear frm Drinking, Gambling and Vice.<br><br>3) U've been jilted by another gal/fella recently and took it real bad, haven't get over it.<br><br>4) U're still a young 'gina' of abt 14-18 years old who haven't matured in the brain department and try to act smart in this forum!!!!!<br><br>Please lah Youwen, GROW UP!!!!!!!</div></blockquote>Jeff, judging from the reply u gave, I came up with these few conclusions :<br><br>1. U are damn tiko and embrace porn because it is your saviour capable of rescuing u from your sexual hunger and deprivation.<br><br>2. U are a Very Very self-centered person. Your life is centered ard vices.<br><br>3. U are promiscuous. One nite stand is your way of life. (better go for a full body check up soon hor)<br><br>4. U are basically stupid. It could be inherited or it could be due to some accidents when u were a kid. I really dont know.<br><br>Finally, I would like to say this: If u like porn and simply cannot stop this habit, then pls keep this to yourself. DONT treat porn the same way as someone who is on a diet would treat chocolates or icecream. "Hey it is okay to eat my fav chocolates once a while wat" Yes, it is okay cos we are talking about dieting and the influences u have on other pple lifes are not that significant. But the same cannot be said of porn. When all of us treat porn like choco which is okay to consume once a while, wat will the world become???? Wat messenge are u sending to younger pple?? U may not realise the influence u have on other pple but pls dont underestimate it.<br><br>And ya, jeff, pls wash your hands before touching any thing ok???<br><br></div>
