But anything too extreme is not healthy. Up to their own measurement as to what is consider extreme.<br><br>I wish to stress on the point that SEX is not a tool to hold your man's heart or control his sexual desire for other women. Dun be a fool and fall for that. Only have sex when both party fully understand the consequence of it. Subjective matter whether is it right to have premartial sex. Just keep these pointers in mind.<br><br></div></blockquote>Tet,<br><br>Let me ask u a simple question: Is it possible that a rapist or a pervert is what he is today because partly he watches too much porn? If the answer is yes, then do u think it is likely that he starts from a beginner level first(ya like wat u said, surfing porno surf and cds, confidently assuming he has total control of his character development) without having thoughts that he would oneday become a rapist and end up miserably behind bars for almost the rest of his best life??? Ask yourself, do we become "bad" overnite or it is more likely to be due to a slow but powerful corrupting effect of porn material.<br><br>My point is if u dont mind porno material, pls keep this to yourself and dont spread the word that "it is okay as long as u dont do it too much". The problem is we tend to overestimate ourselves. Are u sure we can say no to more?? Are we realli so good, beyond temptation????</div>

Are you harbouring such strong views just to rebutt this other fella or wut?<br><br>I wouldn't know what goes on in the minds of all rapists but I'd imagine they're deprived ppl. Their need for sex forces them to do what they do; if these desires are fulfilled from pornography or whatever, then they're somewhat at ease with themselves (for however long it is) aren't they?<br><br>I think there were rapists before the advent of pornography as we know it; guys are horny (I know!

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm... how come I dun feel excited looking at Porn? Am I abnormal? I mean I do receive plenty of porns from frens, and also did surf the web before for it... but looking at those pics dun really arouse me... I rather read those R(A) stories...<br><br>actually, youwen's thinking is kinda conservative, but her considerations are not to be ignored... its true that such things can happen. Tet wrote about the mental state of rapist, but I dun think all rapist are like dat... I wud give it a 50-50 on rapist being in that kind of mental state as compared to rapist who only wants to satisfy their sexual desires...<br><br>youwen, I can feel that you're sensitive about such things, and that thinking is what that is being taught to us by school and society, which I think at this point in time, is wayout of sync with the true state the world is in... I know people feel sad that the society hv degraded to be like dat, but how wud you know this shouldn't be the norm?<br><br>I mean does what society makes us believe means what we must practice? I'm not saying those people shd sleep around with numerous guys and gals, but just that I won't stand out and say they are wrong, cos this world is as confused as my brain, and my belief is that there are no absolute rights and wrongs...<br><br>geez... writing out of point huh...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Whens the end coming?

            <div class='col-md body'>Youwen,it is immature for you to resort to name calling and thus far from your posts,i guess the people in this post have infered that you are an immature person to have to resort to calling people's name to get your point across,if you bother to back your arguments up with facts anf logic,it will be a better way of bringing your point across.From your posts,i can infer that<br><br>1)You like to seek attention<br>2)You are an extremists in your views,these type of people are the most dangerous in this world eg religious extremists as they will only see their own point of view and is not willing to listen to arguments or even glance at the point's of views of others,anyone who does not share your point of view is condemn and subjected to name calling as evident in your posts<br><br>To view pornography is quite commom in our day and age when it is so easily available with teh advent of the internet,and i would say that it's pretty normal unless it becomes the focal point of your life and you start to get controlled by it,a little pornography doesn't hurt anyone,hehehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>It's take a second to look at my makan,a minute to finish my burger and a lifetime to enjoy all the food i want <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">~~~<br>Diablo 2 rockzzzzzz  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>[This message has been edited by moose (edited 29 June 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Youwen, frm ALL your replies to this thread. The ONLY conclusion that I could draw is tat:<br><br>YOU'RE A GINA WHO IS STILL IMMATURED IN THE MIND AND HAVE A CONSERVATIVE THINKING LIKE THAT OF A 'M.C.P'. FURTHERMORE YUR COMPREHENSION SKILLS ARE DAMN REALLY BAD, YOU'RE A SHALLOW-MINDED FELLA AND U'RE A VERY BIASED FELLA WHO ONLY SEES ONE SIDE OF THE STORY TO EVERYTHING.<br><br>Let's face the facts shall we? The SBA can't go round surfing the web EVERYDAY to ban ALL Singaporeans from surfing porn. Porn IS bad for one's mentality but surfing for porn ONCE IN A BLUE MOON is alright as long as it doesn't turn INTO an OBSESSION! Too much of anything IS BAD.<br><br>In this world of ours, one can't really steer clear of porn. Even in the movies, newspapers, magazines... There IS some degree of PORNOGRAPHY everywhere. Scantily-clad woman ARE considered as Pornography too (but to a lesser degree).<br><br>IF U CONSIDER YURSELF AS ONE WHO STEERS CLEAR FROM ANYTHING RELATED TO PORNOGRAPHY. STAY IN YOUR FLAT THE WHOLE DAMN DAY AND DON'T EVEN ATTEMPT TO FLIP THE PAPERS, MAGAZINES, JAPANESE MANGA, OR EVEN TURN ON THE TELEVISION!!!!!!! U SHALLOW-MINDED A**HOLE.</div>

I know of friends who are couples who watch pornography to get pointers, hehehe...... and I agree with Tet, don't use sex as a handle for ur bf, just not the way it should go.<br><br>And everyone, youwen might be rather extreme in his views, but if he really does have his principles which he adheres strongly to, then let him. But on the otherhand, youwen, just as u disagree violently to this issue, u will fail if u try to impose ur thoughts on others this way.

Internet is for everyone who knows how to use a computer and who has an internet account, modem,cable...need I say more??? Basically, we use the net to do so many useful things like shopping on line, research, hotels booking etc etc. Let assume that u are right for the first time in your life that i am realli conservative, does that mean I have no rights to access the net??? Dont be a dumbass like jeff007 lah! Please lah! By asking pple to get lost cos he or she has a totally diff view from yours is not realli that mature u know??? So in the future if u wanna ask pple to grow up hor, look at yourself in the mirror and say " I need to grow up first "<br><br></div>

Besides... after viewing alotta porn you kinda get bored of it.<br><br>watching porn does not make ur bf love you anyless nor anymore.... neither is it damaging to your psyche...<br><br>self control is the key here... if ur mind gets affected by the porn the fault is with yourself for letting it get to you.<br><br>Not the porn.</div>
