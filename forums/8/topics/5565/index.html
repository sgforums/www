            <div class='col-md body'>Hui-Neng<br><br>Ok, u do have your opinions, and so does everybody else. I would like to explain to you what ego really is, but first...<br><br>I know that a lot of my posts are quite egotistical, but fact #1.-u don't know me do u?  So insulting me just really says a lot about the kind of person u r. so I come in defense of myself...<br><br>Just to drag myself to ur level, I would like to express a view of mine.<br><br>U seem like the kind of person who believes in all-consuming modesty.  That's ur view.<br>Let me ask u...Are u Singaporean?<br><br>If u r, I am willing to guess that u didn't have to go through any or many hardships in your life.  Even if u had, society here is so insulated that you would never truly understand what it's like for people who grew up under harsher circumstances than u.  My statements were made to let people know that it takes a lot of hard work to get what u want.  U seem to think that everyone must be humble and crap like that.  i believe in moderations of it.  Sometimes, for some issues, I have no modesty what-so-ever.  I won't tell u my life story, but suffice to say that I grew up having to rely on myself.  Everything I did, I never turned to friends or family for support (except to pay for school and essentials like that).  In terms of raw emotional growth, I never turned to anyone or had anyone to turn to, so excuse me for praising my accomplishments or lack of.  Like I said, u wouldn't even have an inkling of what the real world is like.  I don't believe people should be modest if they are able to accomplish something.  Modesty is a facade used by a lot of conservative and not so conservative people to gain concessions or approval from other people.  But it's false isn't it.  If u did soemthing, be proud of it.  Don't pretend that it wasn't such a great thing.  Of course, going overboard is another thing.<br><br>It seems that u have a problem with people who are confident in themselves.  Maybe we should all have low self-esteem.  Not a chance.  If u think I'm egotistical, then fine, go ahead, but I will say this again,"u have no idea what i'm like."<br><br>What u read here is just a small part of the kind of person I am.  Maybe u can't handle people whho are straightforward with what they have to say.  But then it goes back to the idea that u have to put up a false front to please people.  I'm definately not trying to please anyone am I?  In the end, I'm more truthful about myslef than u are aren't I?<br><br>U must be very conservative...a throwback from history if u think that anything on this site is Godawful.  This site is so mild it's not even funny.  and Most of the girls in the fotos are from average on up with most being on the up scale.  which are u?<br><br>R u fit to judge people?  What criteria do u judge us ego people by?  Do u have high intelligence?  Are u pretty?  It may sound fucked up, but if u aren't a combo of this then you shouldn't be commenting on people's ego.<br><br>"people who are devoid of, dismiss, falsify or discount their ego are non-entities.  They exist for existence sake.  Have no reason save to breath.  In the end, their existence is pointless.  To know yourself is to have an ego.  To be confident is to have an understanding and growth of that same ego."<br>Ounkeo, Wansai<br><br>This quote by a not so common philosopher says it all.<br><br>If u really feel like dumping crap on me, feel free to mail me.  If u want more ego from me than what u read, please read my newer post about myself, then let me know what u think.  Definately u would have a small enough mind to automatically think that evryone who has an ego must be losers.  All the great things ever done in this world was by people who had oversized egos.  Have u ever heard of anyone with low self-esteem doing anything signifigant in their lifetime.  Not many people...<br></div>

My post above wasn't a cut at Singaporeans in General...Only to those ones who have pampered lives trying to judge everyone else by their own pampered lives.

            <div class='col-md body'>Heh. Ego, like dignity and pride, requires you to have a sense of self, and that sense of self is generally defined in our society by what others think/respond/interact with us, rather than any internally created identity. Fortunately, if you think about it, ego and pride are really quite pointless considerations that require you to waste mental and emotional energy taking into account a lot of trivialities like the opinions of others <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Interesting circular tautology by saying that your non-egoness exists through an egotistical expression of it. Reminds me of the liar's paradox, where a man comes up to you and says "I am lying right now."<br><br></div>

Why I did I don't know...I guess it was probably a guy thing...guys egos are bruised very easily.<br><br>Anyway, as I was saying somewhere else on the board, what I say here, I say for many reasons, the least of which is for my ego.<br><br>AS for my fondness for long posts...well, u can choose.<br><br>1. Firewire is full of shit, and everything can't be flushed down so a lot of it gets regurgitated back out...ie to this site. :-)<br><br>2. Firewire's really got something interesting to say.<br><br>3. Firewire can't find people outside who he can communicate with on such levels...Due to not mixing around enough...no ones fault but my own..lone-wolf type and everything.:-)<br><br>4. Firewire is full of shit.<br><br>Take ur pick and let me know.  :-)<br><br>Hmmm.  Pretty huh?  Wanna post ur picture or send it in for  us 2 see?  I wouldn't ask if i wasn't willing to do the same thing.  In fact, I'm in the process of creating a page to upload now so I can link my image to my posts.<br><br>:-)<br><br>p.s- My real name isn't firewire either...although I wish it was...ha ha.:-)<br><br>PPS Ah Hell!!  I'll post my pic now.  what's the point of waiting.  I guess now's just as good as later.<br><br>Ah hell, go to my site.  The design is screwed up becase I did it just to post pics for people to see.<br><br><a href="http://members.xoom.com/firewire_iee" rel="nofollow">http://members.xoom.com/firewire_iee</a><br><br>sometimes xoom doesn't load right away.  U might get an error message.  Just try and enter again.<br><br>PS-a person who posts his picture on the web definately has ego :-)<br><br>I apologize to everyone for posting so many useless things the last few hours... In a vain attempt to post a pic here it seems.  My free services don't allow me to link to the images in my site so u have to go there directly.  Again I apologize.<br><br>I guess I've been "spamming" this wonderful site lately.  Damn.<br><br>[This message has been edited by firewire (edited 26-10-1999).]</div>
