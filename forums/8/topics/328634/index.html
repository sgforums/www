              <p>actually i also dunno.</p>
              <p>i try not to bring up the topic of wedding in front of the gal, in case she starts thinking wat actually went wrong.</p>
              <p>for 2 yrs, she has already been 'bombarded' by friends on when's the wedding; a Q she practically has no answer to.</p>
              <p>she did try talking to the bf, but seems like his reply was 'i know u been waiting all this while, so u wan wait, u continue to wait, else u can let go, i won't blame u'.</p>
              <p>i was like ??? when she told me.</p>
              <p>she did consult those friends who are already married on how the initial planning went; but it seems that the couples either has the guy doing the planning but roping in the gal into the discussion or the couples sat down and have a discussion on things. But, either way, it was the guy who started the topic first.</p>
              <p>In her case, she has to start the topic herself.</p>
              <p>hrmm.. any implication? any advice for her? i am at my wits end, i dunno how to console her.</p>

              <p>sigh.. -_-"</p>
              <p>recently, during a gathering with both the gal's and guy's
              friends, plus the guy's family members, the gal announced that the
              'accepted proposal' was called off, take it that the proposal never
              happened before.</p>
              <p>The guy sat there, just shrugged his shoulders.</p>
              <p>hrmm.. i dun understand.</p>

              <p>i am a gal, i dun actually know how a guy thinks, and i also know that friends (guys) jus assured the gal that there's nothing wrong as they didnt wanna see her too upset.</p>
              <p>wat i wanna know and is very curious is,</p>
              <p>y did d bf proposed?</p>
              <p>y did he reacted the way he did?</p>
              <p>y did he seem not even interested in the wedding?</p>
              <p>y did he drag so long, and is still dragging?</p>
              <p>i can onli see it from a gal's views; the time he proposed, was the time when there were suddenly many suitors ard the gf, thus to ensure that she's 'his', he proposed. At that moment, maybe he really wanted to get married, and at the same time, rid the bees away. But after a few weeks, he regretted and started to seem less interested.</p>
              <p>As for dragging and not lifting a finger in planning - i felt maybe it's cos the gf was a very detailed person, so he jus let her plan instead, but it's wrong, cos which gal wan to plan their own wedding w/o d groom-to-be ard, it's = she's jus marrying herself.</p>
              <p>I dunno if i am rite in feeling dat way; any guys to help out? as in answering the Qs?</p>

              <p>IMHO, the wedding is but the one of the first steps to a marriage. If like that also cannot sort out, then the challenges ahead will be worse... In the future, there will be tasks that involves several parties (in-laws, friends, whatever...) in many kind of weird or cliche situations.</p>
              <p>I suggest that u shd consider getting marriage counselling (or something like tt) from ROM first... Dun start off with the wrong step. Very painful one... Wedding issues can be brought up again many years later, as a topic for quarrels &amp; comparison. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/unhappy.png" alt="unhappy.png">  </p>
