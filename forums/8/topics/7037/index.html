            <div class='col-md body'>hmm, i can see some high tension in here...as for being racist or not, i can't, in anyway, see how this thread comes across as racist.<br><br>However, my reasons for sticking with my ethnic background might be considered as racist by some. For being proud of ur own ethnic race can be constituted as being racist. I choose to believe that being racist is to be stereotyping, having negative perceptions and always on the lookout to demean and humiliate them.<br><br>For me, I loved being a Chinese. For my ethnic race has been around for 5000 years and our cilivisation stretches back further than other civilisation. I m proud of looking yellow, having slant eyes and got dark black hair. I love Chinese history and my culture, and most importantly of all, I loved my own ethnic women!! Gosh, they are so beautiful. The hypes about Japanese ladies, in my opinion, is over-rated  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">I loved my language and I feel comfortable speaking my native tongue with my ah-ma and using Chinese with my friends from the same ethnicity background. I m proud of being a "Chink" as some people likes to call my race and I m encouraged to know of the thousands of Disapora around the world. I get worried when the cross-straits tension broke up and i cheered when a fellow Chinese took the Nobel prize for physics and another became the Man of the Year in the 1998 Time magazine.<br><br>There u have it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>Me and my ethnicity<br>and me so proud of it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>

Seniority upmost important, greet all elder (including elder cousins) according to seniority everytime we meet, greet before eating, not allow to talk back to elders etc. After so many years, got so used to those tradition.
