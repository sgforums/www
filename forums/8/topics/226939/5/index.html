It might help. You might have felt that you had put in a hell lot of effort and time and mugged like no one's business, but still, you got undesirable grades ( in your eyes). Okay, that feeling is horrid. That is undeniable. But then, are you going to stay there and wallow in self-pity, or gain sympathy from others, or would you choose to shut up and transform this "setback" into a force that propels you to work harder? Think about that.<br><br>Clearly, YJC is not as popular as any other prestigous jcs like Hwa Chong or Raffles. Okay, so? Does that mean that you are fated to do badly in YJC? Obviously not. So what if the society stereotypes? Who cares? Are you living for yourself or for the society?<br><br>Whichever the case, your choice of JCs was irrefutably unwise. With 16 points, you should had know better what chocies to put, especially when they had provided you with a table with all the intake scores.<br><br>You may say, oh, easier said than done, I have never experienced such nasty things before. True, I was never worried about my JC selection. But do think of what I've said. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>X2</div>
