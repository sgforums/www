After all, reputation is almost always the best indication of the breadth, depth, rigour and overall quality of the education provided there. But ask yourself this: did you really want to gain admittance into the better JCs? Was there a burning passion, a relentless wanting within you? Were you ready to make the necessary sacrifice of time and effort, and to forego some of the things you love for the pursuit of academic success? More crucially, did you actually make the aforementioned sacrifices to an extent significant enough for the attainment of your curricular ambitions? Most importantly, do you think that you actually gave all you got and did your best?<br><br>The main point I'm trying to illustrate is that you obviously lacked conscientiousness and did not put in sufficient effort, and your lack of diligence, self-discipline, a positive attitude and a clear set of goals is consequently reflected in your less-than-mediocre results. You really shouldn't be frustrated about your unsurprising inability to get into your first-choice JC, much less releasing your irrational anger on other forum users, which is highly immature to say the least. If I were you, I wouldn't whine so much but would instead consider this a hard lesson learnt. I'd start planning ahead for my JC years, making decisions on what subjects to take, what CCAs to participate in, reflect on what I'd like to achieve, learn or make out of myself in the two years I will inevitably spend there.<br><br>The bottom line is it's time to come to a realisation and get all your s-hit together. Be optimistic of what's ahead of you, practise humility (more so when you don't have genuine substance to offer) and stay focused on your tasks at hand.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by RETARDED_MORON:</div><div class="quote_body">It's really natural that you actually look out for reputation as one of the foremost criteria in the making of your choice of JC; most people wouldn't condemn you for wanting prestige. After all, reputation is almost always the best indication of the breadth, depth, rigour and overall quality of the education provided there. But ask yourself this: did you really want to gain admittance into the better JCs? Was there a burning passion, a relentless wanting within you? Were you ready to make the necessary sacrifice of time and effort, and to forego some of the things you love for the pursuit of academic success? More crucially, did you actually make the aforementioned sacrifices to an extent significant enough for the attainment of your curricular ambitions? Most importantly, do you think that you actually gave all you got and did your best?<br><br>The main point I'm trying to illustrate is that you obviously lacked conscientiousness and did not put in sufficient effort, and your lack of diligence, self-discipline, a positive attitude and a clear set of goals is consequently reflected in your less-than-mediocre results. You really shouldn't be frustrated about your unsurprising inability to get into your first-choice JC, much less releasing your irrational anger on other forum users, which is highly immature to say the least. If I were you, I wouldn't whine so much but would instead consider this a hard lesson learnt. I'd start planning ahead for my JC years, making decisions on what subjects to take, what CCAs to participate in, reflect on what I'd like to achieve, learn or make out of myself in the two years I will inevitably spend there.<br><br>The bottom line is it's time to come to a realisation and get all your s-hit together.

Good luck.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </div></blockquote>i take it as being natural when i counter-flame.<br><br>on the contrary..im pretty sure i gave in all i could. effort, diligence, discipline and goals were all present. as far as i can remember, the whole year prior to Os was spent on studying, weekends included.<br><br>one thing im sure of, the chances of me staying in YJC for the remaining 2 years in percentage is 10%.<br><br>i see stereotyping in action here. its definitely unjust to attribute less-than-mediocre results to lack of diligence etc etc.<br><br>in actual fact, my directions prior to As and even after As are clearly mapped out early this year already.<br><br>you didn't face the prospect of hitting bottom marks when you did all you could already. try taking some wasted effort as a hard lesson learnt.<br><br>but yes, i see your sound advice.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
