            <div class='col-md body'>Well ever felt lost when u;re out of relationships or feeling desperate fer another gal? This type of situations are common nowadays. Well i can say i'm one of those examples.Lets talk about your first love and how was it like. Well First love are very memorable to ppl but not to most guys i suppose. In this new age world toking about first love maybe something which we may haf forgotten or dun bother to even talk about it. Well my first love was rather intresting to me cause in de past love means having a galfren, holding hands, kissing. Well even a fool at my age now would think i'm stupid, backdated or wadever. Well me myself think so too. Love has so much meaning, breaking up is never easy, let's all say that once u have started a relationship, would u try yer best to keep on to the relationship or try yer very best to spoil it. Well i do have some frenz who haf galfrenz who are really nice gals but haf bastards as boyfrens and in the end those gals get hurt emotionally. Is the saying, Bad guys attract more to good looking gals true??<br>Uptill now based on what i've jus seen in my whole life that saying was rather true.Y do 'some' guys never treasure a good galfren which they haf in their hands? Are they being selfish to other guys who may haf liked this gal but was rejected due to someother reasons??Well i haf experience such cases b4 and i'm sad to say life is being unfair.<br><br>Next is about breaking up, i'm sure 90%of the population who is above 14 yrs old have had a breakup in their relationships b4. Well i do had a breakup b4 and everytime i cry after that thinking wad has gone wrong or y din i keep the realtionship? Some ppl may think i'm a sissy or wad , crying at a age like me.But it's just my nature, i'm more of a emotional fella so i jus can't help it. Ever thought of y yur relationship fell or y did the gal u really love, has a boyfren wif a personallity of a bastard?<br>Well the rest is up to u peeps to comment<br>I know wad i haf jus typed is abit out of point to wad my topic is about sorry<br><br>------------------<br>Life's a bitch<br>Suharto</div>
