              <p><strong>1. What is this 4G4Good movement about?</strong></p>
              <p>4G4Good movement is an initiative by StarHub Mobile with the goal to 
              do more with 4G by empowering, educating and inspiring as many as 
              possible.</p>
              <p>Between 12 July to 31 August 2014, StarHub Mobile post-paid 
              subscribers can pledge their unused talk-time, mobile data, and SMS from
               their StarHub Mobile post-paid bill for August 2014 towards the less 
              privileged. StarHub then aims to disburse StarHub Prepaid cards to each 
              beneficiary with a minimum of 80 minutes’ talk-time, 300 SMS and 1GB of 
              data per month for 12 months beginning October 2014. We hope to support 
              up to 500 beneficiaries from the five selected charity organisations, as
               determined by StarHub.</p>
              <p><strong>2. How can I participate?</strong></p>
              <p>StarHub Mobile post-paid subscribers, who want to participate in the 
              4G4Good Programme, may pledge unused minutes, data, and SMS from their 
              StarHub Mobile Postpaid line by sending “Opt-in” to 6904 via SMS.</p>
              <p><strong>3. How will I know that my pledge has been received?</strong></p>
              <p>A confirmation SMS will be sent for each successful pledge. Each 
              eligible StarHub Mobile post-paid line is only able to make a pledge 
              once under this Programme.</p>
              <p><strong>4. Which are the adopted charity organisations that StarHub is supporting and why?</strong></p>
              <p>StarHub has selected five charity organisations whose beneficiaries 
              would greatly benefit from access to mobile telecommunication. This 
              would either be due to their reliance on support from caregivers for 
              medical reasons or due to disabilities. Selection of individual 
              beneficiaries would also take into consideration their income status, to
               help ensure that the truly needy benefit.</p>
              <p>Our adopted charity organisations for this initiative are:</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Asian Women’s Welfare Association</span></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.awwa.org.sg">www.awwa.org.sg</a></p>
              <p>AWWA, being in its 44th year, served over 5000 clients from infancy 
              as young as 9 months old to seniors at 97 years old. Our mission is to 
              empower the disadvantaged (children with special needs, disabilities, 
              families, elderly &amp; caregivers) to maximise their potential to lead 
              independent and dignified lives.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cerebral Palsy Alliance Singapore</span></p>
              <p><a href="http://cpas.org.sg/">http://cpas.org.sg/</a></p>
              <p>Formerly known as Spastic Children’s Association of Singapore, the 
              Cerebral Palsy Alliance Singapore (CPAS), was established in 1957 to 
              provide persons with Cerebral Palsy and multiple disabilities with early
               intervention, special education, rehabilitation services, day activity 
              centre programmes, vocational training and gainful employment in 
              Singapore. </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ISCOS (Industrial &amp;Services Co-Operative Society)</span></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.iscos.org.sg">www.iscos.org.sg</a></p>
              <p>ISCOS (Industrial &amp; Services Co-operative Society Ltd) is a 
              social organisation that helps members (ex-offenders) and their families
               make positive changes to reintegrate successfully into society. 
              Established in 1989, it has now over 13,000 members who have benefited 
              from various programmes and initiatives ranging from employment and 
              skills training to family-bonding activities.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singapore Association of the Visually Handicapped</span></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.savh.org.sg">www.savh.org.sg</a></p>
              <p>The Singapore Association of the Visually Handicapped (SAVH) is a 
              voluntary welfare organisation, founded in 1951. Their mission is to 
              help the Visually Impaired help themselves by acquiring new skills and 
              gaining self-reliance to cope with the integration into society.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Society for the Physically Disabled</span></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.spd.org.sg">www.spd.org.sg</a></p>
              <p>The Society for the Physically Disabled works towards the integration
               of people with disabilities into mainstream society. Through programmes
               that encompass rehabilitation, employment, training, education, 
              consultation and assessment in assistive technology, day care, and 
              social service support, they work in partnership with people with 
              disabilities to maximise their potential and to help them to be 
              self-reliant and independent.</p>
              <p>You may find out more information about them by clicking on the links.</p>
              <p><strong>5. Can I select the charity organisation I want?</strong></p>
              <p>No, you will not be able to do so. All donations will be disbursed as
               equitably as possible to the beneficiaries from the charity 
              organisations selected, based on the organisations’ relative 
              requirements.</p>
              <p><strong>6. Will there be any charges for SMS sent?</strong></p>
              <p>There will be no additional SMS charges.</p>
              <p><strong>7. What if I do not have any un-utilised mobile data, minutes or SMS after I have made my pledge?</strong></p>
              <p>No mobile data, minutes or SMS from your postpaid mobile line will 
              disbursed to the beneficiaries if you do not have unused data, minutes 
              or SMS. No money will be deducted from your line as well.</p>
              <p><strong>8. Upon a successful pledge to 4G4Good, will the adopted charity 
              organisations receive more donation if I reduce my talk time/SMS 
              sent/data usage?</strong></p>
              <p>StarHub aims to disperse the donations to each beneficiary per month (for 12 months) as follows:</p>
              <p>• 80 minutes of talktime</p>
              <p>• 300 SMS</p>
              <p>• 1 GB of mobile data</p>
              <p><strong>9. Would I get tax rebate by making a pledge?</strong></p>
              <p>There is no tax rebate as the pledge is intended to support StarHub in the 4G4Good initiative only.</p>
              <p><strong>10. I am on Power Connect mobile plan and my plan allows airtime 
              rollover to next month. Would you stop the rollover if I opt in to 
              pledge?</strong></p>
              <p>No, this is a pledge movement only. The airtime rollover arrangement will continue as per usual.</p>
              <p><strong>11. I am a StarHub TV/ Broadband customer. Why I am not given a chance to support this charity movement?</strong></p>
              <p>This is only applicable for StarHub Mobile customers as we are only 
              looking at the pledging of unused mobile data, minutes and talktime.</p>
              <p><strong>12. Will my name be displayed in somewhere (corporate website) after I pledge?</strong></p>
              <p>We will not be indicating the names of people who have pledged on our website.</p>
              <p><strong>13. How did StarHub decide on the amount to donate to each beneficiary?</strong></p>
              <p>We aim to offer to each beneficiary StarHub Mobile prepaid cards with
               80 minutes of talktime, 300 SMS and 1 GB of mobile data each. This is 
              based on our estimation of what an average mobile phone user would need 
              on a monthly basis. This was calculated based on our examination of how 
              much unutilised talk-time, mobile data and SMS StarHub Mobile post-paid 
              customers have on average each month and how many pledges we hope to 
              receive.</p>
              <p><strong>14. What is the minimum amount of pledges that StarHub needs to 
              get before donations take place? (If we get too few pledges, will fewer 
              than 500 beneficiaries get less than the targeted 80 minutes, 300 SMS 
              and 1GB?)</strong></p>
              <p>StarHub will assess the total number of pledges at the end of the 
              campaign to determine if we can meet our target of giving 500 
              beneficiaries 80 minutes of talk-time, 300 SMS and 1GB of mobile data 
              each month. If fewer pledges are received, we will review the number of 
              beneficiaries instead of the amount of free services for each 
              beneficiary, as the proposed amounts of talk-time, mobile data and SMS 
              are what we feel would be an adequate provision for the beneficiaries' 
              communications needs.</p>
              <p>However, we hope that enough StarHub Mobile post-paid customers will 
              come forward and make their pledge to enable us to reach our intended 
              target of 500 beneficiaries, hence we are kick-starting the drive with 
              our donation to MINDS.</p>
              <p>We urge all StarHub Mobile postpaid customers to show their support and pledge 4G4Good today.</p>
              <p><strong>14. How would I be able to know how much I have donated?</strong></p>
              <p>You may refer to the un-utilized minutes, data and SMS in the monthly bill.</p>
              <p><strong>15. Are there any other ways I can help the beneficiaries?</strong></p>
              <p>You can also donate your old mobile phones, with accompanying 
              charger, to the adopted charity organisations at selected StarHub Shops.
               Your donated mobile phone will be cleaned and all data removed and sent
               to the adopted charity organisations for distribution to the 
              beneficiaries on a monthly basis.</p>
