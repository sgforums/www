              <p><br><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Delinquency rate for credit cards has fallen over past 10 years</strong></span><br> <em><span class="update">By Millet Enriquez | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 12 October 2012 2022 hrs </span></em></span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span><br>Singaporeans may be 
              charging a higher amount of credit on their cards on average every 
              month, but the Credit Bureau Singapore (CBS) has said the number of 
              accounts with missed payments have dropped in the past 10 years. <br><br>This is due to low unemployment levels and responsible lending policies. <br><br>While
               the monthly credit card balance per consumer - which consists of 
              charged amount and rollovers - rose 54 per cent from S$3,275 in 2002 to 
              S$5,034 in 2012, the percentage of credit cards with overdue payments 
              fell to 2.07 per cent of credit cardholders this year. <br><br>That is compared to 2.4 per cent a decade ago.<br><br>The average monthly default rate in the past eight years was also at a low of 0.06 per cent.<br><br>The
               bureau, which celebrates its 10th anniversary this year, is set to 
              introduce an SMS alert system by end-November to inform customers on 
              fraudulent use of their identity for loan applications. This is to 
              enhance its credit monitoring system. <br><br><strong>CBS is also expanding its 
              data provider base by including non-banking institutions like telecom 
              and utility companies to gather customer data which can be used for 
              credit assessment. </strong><br><br>William Lim, executive director of the Credit
               Bureau Singapore, said: "This is what we normally call alternative 
              data, the non-traditional source of data. It helps the new markets 
              entrants, <strong>the consumers who have no credit history to have a credit 
              history, so that the lenders can have better visibility in terms of 
              their credit performance in the past. So if I am a new graduate coming 
              onto the job market, there is actually no history that I would have with
               CBS."</strong><br><br>CBS is also exploring cross-border exchange of data with credit bureaus in other countries.<br><br>Mr
               Lim said: "We believe that in a current situation where the workforce 
              is very mobile, that can be beneficial to consumers as well as to 
              lenders alike. So it is something that is on the table."<br><br>In his 
              keynote speech, Minister of State for Trade and Industry Teo Ser Luck, 
              who was guest of honour at the CBS 10th anniversary seminar on Friday, 
              said Singapore ranked eighth in the world in terms of credit access, 
              citing the Doing Business 2012 report by the World Bank. <br><br>He also noted the role of a strong credit bureau in a country's financial infrastructure and overall economic growth.<br><span style="color: #0000ff;"><br></span><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Set
               up by The Association of Banks in Singapore and Infocredit Holdings in 
              2002, CBS helps financial services firms in their risk management by 
              providing credit data. </span><br></strong><br>From an initial 10 members, the bureau now has 28. <br><strong><br>It provides over one million credit reports to members each month - up from over 8,000 monthly a decade ago. </strong><br><br>Its credit card base has also grown to over 1.4 million from only 747,091 in 2002.<br><br>- CNA/ms</span></span></p>
