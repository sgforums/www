              We are able to pay SP services bill at SP Services Customer Service Centres with our credit card. It will be good if we can do likewise via internet banking. But do you think is it wise to do so?
              
              We are encouraged to pay recurring bills via credit card instead of GIRO. What are the likely consequences if we are unable to clear our monthly credit card bill?
              
              We will be subjected to at least 2% interest rate for the outstanding amount, including the new transactions done via credit card.
              
              Illustration
              
              Outstanding amount: $1000
              New transactions amount: $1000
              Interest: 2%
              Total outstanding amount for next bill: $1000 + $1000 + $40 (2% interest) = $2040
              
              Therefore please do not just pay the minimum sum. Please clear our monthly credit card bill promptly.

              <p>Whenever I use my cards, I make it a point to make payment to the credit cards before the monthly statement comes. This would keep my statements clean, and make the bank owe me credit instead.</p>

              Bank and VISA made 1 to 3 percent of the amount charged from the retailer when we make payment using credit card.
              
              In view of this circumstance, should retailers give customers 1 to 3 percent discount for making payment in cash, using EZ-link card or NET?

              Some people do not have any credit card. Some people have more than one credit card. 
              
              Some become bankrupt because of credit card. Some people are better of with credit card. 
              
              Credit card is not the root cause of financial problem.
              
              What are the root causes for some people to get into financial difficulty?
              
              Is it the way we manage our money?
              
              Is it because of our addiction to gambling, shopping or the desire to possess branded items?

              <p>Credit Bureau (Singapore) Pte Ltd (CBS) is Singapore's most
                                      comprehensive consumer credit bureau that has full-industry uploads
                                      from all retail banks and major financial institutions. It is a
                                      joint venture between The Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS)
                                      and Infocredit Holdings Pte Ltd.</p>
              <p>The setting up of a consumer credit bureau in Singapore is a
                                      significant addition to enhance the RepublicÂ´s risk management
                                      capability. Since 2002, the Banking Act has allowed CBS members to
                                      disclose and obtain credit-related information to mitigate consumer
                                      credit risk through information pooling from CBS. The Monetary
                                      Authority of Singapore (MAS) provides the regulatory guidance and
                                      support to CBS to bolster the integrity and transparency of
                                      SingaporeÂ´s financial sector.</p>
              <p>To do this, <strong>CBS aggregates credit-related information
                                      amongst participating members and presents a more complete risk
                                      profile of a customer to credit providers. This helps credit
                                      providers to determine the likelihood of the customer repaying,
                                      thus enhancing their risk assessment capabilities.</strong> Our
                                      goal is to help credit providers make better lending decisions
                                      quickly and more objectively.</p>

              SP service charge you 50 cents for sending you a reminder and 1% of the unpaid amount. Bank charge you 2% of outstanding amount due for payment.
              
              Town Council charge you 2% of outstanding amount and $60 adminstrative fee if the amount is overdue for 5 months.

              Thank you. I agree with your view. It is not necessary to have credit card. We can use NET when we shop in Singapore. We should use debit card instead of credit card. Credit cards are designed and created for rich people when it was launched in the market. But nowadays almost anyone who are working can apply for it.
              
              Therefore we should not apply for a credit card if we are poor in managing our money.

              <p>yes and no, in the past some situations the payment method even cash and nets not possible. that's when CC comes in. but later comes debit car, makes cashless transaction even more convenient. its good to have CC for emergency use. sometimes you really do not carry enough cash and ATM is just no aceessible. as for the prvieleges and credit i don;t know. so far no CC companies their goodies appeal to me, or rather is what i need.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>its simple, sit down with a calculator or do some somple maths. its allbasic maths. set aside an amount you need for monhtly bills. AXN and giro so convenient. no longer is flashing credit cards that appealing - even cheap foreign laborÂ can apply for one <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">Â .. and you will fidÂ  that tyou noneed to start a thread here about this anymore.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>the concept is similar to phot editing. the base raw files still need to have some photo quliaties recorded.otherwise no degree of photoshoping is going to help make a bad photo good.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I think whether you have a credit card or a atm <a href="http://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/deposit/bankcard/default.page">bank card</a>, its up to the individual rite? If u got no control, then you will just anyhow spend. Everything must be done in moderation ma. Personally I think using credit card to pay bills is a good idea. can earn shit load of points which u can use to redemn stuff which in a way offsets your bills. At the end of the day, the bills still must be paid whether giro or credit card. Might as well get something from it.Â </p></div>
