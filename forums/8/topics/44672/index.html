            <div class='col-md body'>I'm sure many of us have read news articles abt the 'irresponsible' family of eight in Sembawang. Sad to say many of these related articles have not been kind to the family who've recently lost their grandparents to SARS. The deceased son recently gave a telephone interview on Chinese news programme and had clarified his family's so-called 'irresponsible' actions.<br><br>If his words are to be taken, then I fear that many of us have been deceived by the media's cock n bull story. The reporters have got some inadequeate facts on this incident and then added fuel to fire by including certain irresponsible actions which the family did not partake in back then.<br><br>It's sad to see that even PM Goh and his ppl are not infallible to the media's discrepancies. I tot that our local media prides itself on reporting nothing but the truth. Unfortunately my trust have been misplaced, for several other incidents including this have led me to believe that the media now places sensationalism as its priority.<br><br>And there seems to be no body that can regulate what the media is reporting..all those editing is done by the 'inner' ppl..anything wrong it's not unusual for others to think that there'll be cover-ups. So where's the transparency in media regulation. And if u ask for it..some ppl in media circle may lambast u for trying to restrict freedom of speech.<br><br>Frankly after all this I am very disappointed with the local media. I have now truly appreciate the notion that whatever they print or say has to been taken with a pinch of sceptism or even cynicism. In fact, i believe all of us should not entirely believe in what the local media reports, lest there will more victims of deframing reporting like the bereaved family of 6</div>
