            <div class='col-md body'>It's not like that.<br><br>If only people have 'people food' equivalent to the dog food, it will bring alot of benefits.<br><br>Dog food is designed to fulfill all the nutritional need of dogs.<br><br>A dog can eat it exclusively without any additional food like rice or meat or anything else.<br><br>A dog can eat it exclusively throughout his life.<br><br>You can buy dog food from supermarkets and pet shops, and feed it to your dog.<br><br>Now, imagine.<br><br>Yeah, imagine.<br><br>IF ONLY, there is 'people food'. It will solve alot of problems we humans are facing now.<br><br>We need to eat. One of the most basic human activities is eating. Everybody is eating in this whole wide world. If we can make this most basic activity more efficient n effective, it will be a great leap for us.<br><br>With 'people food' there will be:<br><br>1. Improved health.<br><br>We need all sorts of nutrition but everybody can't eat with perfect pyramid. When u eat a char-kway-teow for lunch, you are sabotaging ur body. How many times cases like this happen worldwide?<br><br>Even when u make a deliberate attempt to eat complete n balanced food, u still lose. It's impractical and impossible to get all the nutrients, and our cooking process destroys a lot of what's already there.<br><br>With 'people food' , people's health will get better. Exponentially. It will revolutionize our health, just like the discovery of fire did.<br><br>2. Economies of scale.<br><br>Imagine u buy a dog food. You feed it to ur dog. That's it. You don't cook, u don't source for ingredients, u don't use fire, u don't use electricity. You don't spend time and effort in preparing the food.<br><br>Why?<br><br>Because all of that has been done by the manufacturer in their plants.<br><br>That's economies of scale.<br><br>You only need to go to the supermarket and buy 1 month supply.<br><br>That's amazing.<br><br>With 6 billion people in this world, everyday eating, can u imagine the amount of saved electricity, saved oil, saved water, saved time, saved effort, saved energies like gas?<br><br>There will be a tremendous benefit from the economies of scale.<br><br>3. Freed resources.<br><br>As a result of economies of scale, we will have freed time, freed electricity, freed water, and so on. Pressure to the environment will be reduced as well.<br><br>Also, less resources used for the eating process.<br><br>Imagine the time people take to eat. 15-20 mins or more. In 1 day we spend 40-60 minutes to eat. With 'people food' we can use much less time. It can take a form of a pulp, simply gulp it down with minimal chewing. Imagine the freed time people all over the world will have.<br><br>All this freed resources like time, money, water, etc, can be better used elsewhere.<br><br>In short, making 'people food' has many advantages for humankind: improved health, economies of scale, and freed resources. The technical barriers can be overcome if scientists want to. But first of course there must be an awareness and a desire.<br><br>When u look at the dog food, it really is a great concept.<br><br>When u copy that concept for humans, it really is a breakthrough.</div>
