            <div class='col-md body'>To the end of his life, Ravel remained curiously ambivalent on the subject of his most popular and frequently performed work.  Â“I have written only one masterpiece,Â” he was once heard to say.  Â“Alas, it contains no music.Â”  Ironically, that audacious masterpiece which he also described as Â“orchestral tissue without musicÂ” was written almost by accident.<br><br>In the summer of 1928, Ravel was approached by the celebrated dancer Ida Rubinstein to produce a ballet on a Spanish subject. The original plan called for Ravel to orchestrate several excepts from Iberia, the colorful piano suite by Isaac AlbÃ©niz.  (Rubinstein undoubtedly thought that Ravel would repeat the enormous success he had enjoyed 6 years earlier with his version of MussorgskyÂ’s piano suite, Pictures at an Exhibition.)  When it was discovered that AlbÃ©niz, before his death, had assigned the rights of orchestration to his former pupil Ferdinand Enrique Arbos, Ravel at first decided to withdraw from the project but then suggested he might prefer to write something of his own.<br><br>The first indication of what the new work would be can be found in a rather disjointed letter that Ravel wrote to the Spanish composer JoaquÃ­n Nin:  Â“No form, properly speaking, no modulation, or almost none; a theme, a rhythm, orchestration.Â”<br><br>Years later, after BolÃ©ro had become a worldwide sensation, Ravel continued to insist that it had been nothing more than a modest experiment. Â“I am particularly desirous that there should be no misunderstanding about this work,Â” he said in an interview published in LondonÂ’s Daily Telegraph.  Â“It constitutes an experiment in a very special and limited direction.  Before its first performance I issued a warning that what I had written was a piece lasting 17 minutes and consisting wholly of one long, unbroken crescendo. There are no contrasts, and there is practically no invention except the plan and manner of execution. The themes are altogether impersonal Â– folk tunes of the usual Spanish-Arabic kind.  And (whatever may have been said to the contrary) the orchestral writing is simple and straightforward throughout, without the slightest attempt at virtuosity.Â”<br><br>Like the music of some of todayÂ’s Minimalist composers, BolÃ©ro is an exercise in controlled monotony, though in this case a monotony whose purpose is neither to sedate nor hypnotize an audience, but to drive it to the brink of hysteria. The structural organization of BolÃ©ro is as startlingly simple as it is breathtakingly original. A single, maddeningly unforgettable melody in C major, with a complementary refrain in a minor key, is repeated over and over without variation or ornamentation to the insistent beat of a side drum. Announced by the flute, the melody is taken up in turn by the clarinet, the bassoon, the E-flat clarinet, the oboe dÂ’amore (a baroque ancestor of the modern instrument), a muted trumpet, the tenor and soprano saxophones, and then by various combinations of instruments as the orchestral texture becomes increasingly complex and the volume Â– to say nothing of the tension Â– builds inexorably. Finally, when it seems that the listenerÂ’ s nerves have been stretched to the limits of their endurance, the composer unleashes his master-stroke:  a sudden, unexpected shift to the key of E major, which has been variously described as a dam bursting, a fever breaking or Â– as the producers of the hit movie 10 (1979) correctly surmised Â– an even more intense form of physical release. An abrupt return to the original key of C major, followed by some barbaric fanfares from the trombones, leads to the work's shattering conclusion.<br><br>At the first performance in Paris on November 22, 1928, BolÃ©ro was an instantaneous and overwhelming success, a success that surprised no one more thoroughly than Maurice Ravel. While the premiere was also a critical triumph, the composer was far more interested in a dissenting opinion that had been heard in the audience that evening. It seems that midway through the performance one of the cityÂ’s bejewelled grand dames began her review of the composerÂ’s latest efforts with cries of Â“He's mad!  He's mad!Â”<br><br>When told of the incident a few days later, Ravel flashed one of his famous, boyish smiles. Â“Aha!Â” he said with evident satisfaction. Â“She understood the piece.Â”</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think you have been hynotised by that piece. I hear it so many times during rehearsals and performances till I got sick of that repetitive tune!  But yah lah, its nice melody to people who hear it once in a while.   :p<br><br>Thanks for coming down, btw.  Great moral supporters, you both!
