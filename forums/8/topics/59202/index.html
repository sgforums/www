(i m assuming u r going for only a holiday n so wun be venturing into the suburbs but will only be hanging ard in the city)<br><br>as for food, unless u r going to splurge...otherwise, eating at the usual eateries along chinatown or "foodcourt"...budget abt $10 per meal, inclusive of drinks<br><br>hope this helps u!<br></div>

With the thugs they've hired to check tram tickets, hopping on without a ticket is the <strong>last</strong> thing you want to do.<br><br>Bismarck, if you've got an ATM card that is compatible with the "Plus" system (check the back of your ATM card), you should be able to use the ATMs here without having to set up a new account.</div>
