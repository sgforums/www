The only president to die in office outside of this pattern was Zachary Taylor who was elected in 1848 and died in 1850, notably a year also ending in zero. The "curse" was "broken" by Ronald Reagan, who was elected in 1980 and survived his presidency, despite having been shot in an assassination attempt.<br><br>-_-</div>
