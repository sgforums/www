              How about punishments with shorter duration like pulling the ears, squat down and come up several times? In this way, the kids will feel embarrasses and shes doesn't have to keep monitoring them?

              Hm... I think if the students commit the offence more than once, he/she must be punished even after apologising. You should ask ur teacher  friend instead.

              <p>yes...i can relate to wad u said...cos the case involving my frend's bro n our tutor mentioned in a much earlier post was sth like tat...as mentioned, he didnt study his spelling despite being scolded b4 during previous lessons. my tutor was someone who would use the cane to cane the student's palms if the student was unrepentant or the offence committed was serious. b4 she did tat, she would 1st inform the parents n tell them y she was caning their child. anyway, my tutor at tat time was on the verge of caning my frend's bro. upon seeing the cane, he got scared n was close to tears. he begged our tutor to give him another chance n apologised again n again to her...</p>
              <p>well, as mentioned in tat post, our tutor didnt cane him. however, she punished him by making him stand at attention at a corner near her n study his spelling for the entire lesson. as mentioned in tat post, he stood for nearly an hr n a half n his legs were so painful n tired at the end of it...my tutor said tat although he apologised, he still had to be punished to deter him from being lazy in future...</p>
              <p>so from tat case, we can see tat apologising does help the student juz as how it helped my frend's bro escape caning. however, apologising may onli go as far as lightening the punishment, it may not help the student to escape punishment totally...</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think all minor punishments must be standardized in a school. The discipline committee should list down all the punishments for offenses and there must be a single teacher that administers the punishments on a rotational basis. For example, if a student didn't do homework, the teacher will submit his name to the discipline committee and ask him to report to the teacher on duty during recess or after school hours to receive punishment. In this way, it also ensures that all students are punished for the same duration unlike the case when the student must be released at the end of the lesson. Haha...</div>

              <p>Reading some examples of punishments that teachers use in previous replies, I can't help but think that it is pretty ridiculous. Doing stuff like embarassing the students with I must say, retarded means, or using violence and terror to keep a child in check isn't really the solution to "discipline" a kid. I have seen it myself, these punishments and harsh treatments will only lead to a rebellious attitude which could evolve into something worse in the future. It can become a form of physical rebellion like joining a gang to create trouble in the streets or a passive rebellion like purposely failing in their schoolwork. Anyone heard of the Gangura in Japan? A really good example of a passive resistance.</p>
              <p>Lets take homework as an example, teachers in Singapore tend to overwork their students to excel in the examinations. Our system is set in such a way that its either you get it or you don't. Resulting in heavy mugging for the general population of students and really limited time to experience their childhood like their counterparts in other countries. I remember seeing a thread whereby a primary 3 year old student was spammed with an entire list of homework for a short vacation break. I assume that sudent is around 7-8 years old? A small child already getting exposed to the exam stress? Okay here's the linking part with the punishments. If teachers were to heavily punish their students or embarass them in some childish way for the homework that is already being overgiven, then its already ridiculous. So allowing teachers to punish their students more harshly will only make things worse. If a teacher assaults a student, he/she gets charged like any other criminal, thats how the world works.</p>

              <p>yesterday i saw a classic example of students apologising but still getting punished. well, it was shown on tv. those of us who have been watching channel 8 from 11-12 at nite will noe tat the current drama serial being screened is entitled Rhapsody in Blue. Jesseca Liu was the main actress in tat drama n in tat drama she acted as a school teacher as well as the stepmother of a gal who unfortunately lost her voice and beloved father(acted by chen hanwei)..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>in last nite's episode, Jesseca was seen punishing her students on 2 occasions. the 1st incident involved a boy in her class who said demeaning things to Jesseca's stepdaughter who had juz joined the class. Jesseca scolded the boy n asked how he would feel if ppl said such things abt him...moments later, Jesseca ordered him to apologise to the gal and then he was ordered to stand in front of the class, facing the blackboard...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>tis was the 1st case tat happened in last nite's episode...will post the 2nd case later...noticed tat Jesseca still punished the student although he apologised to the gal...</p>

              Hm... facing the wall or blackboard was also a common classroom punishment in the 80s. Anyway, I didn't watch this drama but I can imagine how fierce Jessica is. She has the kind of strict teacher look. I'm looking forward to hear what's her 2nd punishment. I guess it's most likely standing outside classroom?
              
              I also read in another forum that a lady teacher drew a small circle high up in the blackboard and the punishment for a small short boy is to put his index finger into the small hole. Each time he moves his finger out of the hole, the teacher will draw the hole higher until he had to tiptoe. Haha... not only his legs suffered, even his arms get aching after 2 periods.

              more than 1 period...my pri 3 teacher used to punish us in a
              similar manner n 1 period is juz abt the maximum we can go without
              dropping our arms..even so, the student will be grimacing in pain
              alredi...</p>
              <p>the 2nd case in tat show actually happened within 5mins of the
              1st...its another common punishment but no standing involved...will
              post tat tml...</p>

              Sorry, I can't remmeber which forum and which thread cos I read about it a long time ago. But then one of my friend whom I met in facebook who studied in the same primary sch as me said that her sec sch teacher used to punish people to stand and stretch out hands horizontally for 1 period. So that's 1 of the common punishment. Hm... I can't think of other punishments that doesn't involve standing other than writing lines. I wonder if my guess is correct.

              Haha.. writing lines is nothing. How long is the boy punished to face the blackboard? Did he face away or move about?

              <p>Despondent, was that a question posted towards my reply? I apologise for the late reply. No offence but did you interpret my words correctly? I did not suggest completely letting the students off but rather nipping the problem in the bud. We should target the thinking and influence that led to such a decrease in student-teacher relationship. This includes making ammendments to our education system and teaching methods.</p>
              <p>The punishments as I have read from previous posts are rather stupid as well. I mean seriously, forcing students to kneel on marbles? smoking cigerettes while holding a few kilograms worth of weight on their arms? Who does that? I wouldn't believe such a thing happened if I didn't read multiple posts on similar things. Physical embarassment such as this is in my opinion a very unrealistic and childish way to handle things. It can solve the problem for a while but will backfire in a while.</p>

              <p>tat teacher is an exceptional case...she was way out of order...but its not true tat it would deter onli for a while n backfire later cos her students were greatly deterred after being punished n the discipline of the school did improve. yet, having said tis, i must admit tat she wasnt a gd teacher when it came to disciplining students cos her punishments were inhumane and sheer torture. she onli kept her place in the teaching industry cos she produced gd results and discipline in the school...</p>

              Hm... I wonder if such punishments (stand facing wall or outside classroom) is still common in schools nowadays. I asked a few of my teacher friends and one of them said it is common in her school where students are punished to stand 15mins outside staff room during recess. Maybe it depends on the school culture too.

With globalisation and a new level of media influence, the punishments that worked in the past may not work now.
