              I asked quite a few of my friends who are teachers and some of them even said that they don't even punish the students to stand outside classroom or staffroom.

              But you mentioned before that whenever her students are punished to stand, they must stand tiptoe automatically without being instructed to? It very common to be punished to stand for talking or forgetting to bring textbook right? In this case, its considered harsh. Haha...I guess after they stand tiptoe, they will then appreciate having the priviledge to stand normally. :D

              Hm... how about if both punishments lasted for the same duration? Normally, the teacher won't consider the duration right? The punishment suppose to last for the whole lesson.

              <p>haha..anyway, both my female frend n myself agree that school discipline nowadays have dropped drastically compared to during our time...i still remember when we were in school, our teachers were not so restricted when it came to giving out punishments...in fact i remember that they were allowed to give any kind of punishment as long it didnt cost injuries or did not cause physical abuse...</p>
              <p>an example of the above would be my chinese teacher in pri 1...this was more than 20yrs ago alredi...she belonged to the older generation of teachers who believed tat punishments were needed to teach n guide students...i remember that most of her students were fearful of her as she nvr had any qualms abt punishing us. she had a wide range of punishments and we nvr knew how she would punish us...</p>
              <p>i remember how scared we would be whenever she asked any of us a qn...she had the habit of doing tat at the start of most lessons...she would randomly pick students to answer qns on the previous lesson. we were expected to revise our work after every lesson and students who couldnt answer the qns correctly would be punished. there were 2 common punishments she would give for this. she would scold the student for not revising his work and then order him to stand at a corner in front of the class and either 1) hold up his textbook above his head, keeping his arms straight up or 2) stand at a corner in front of class wif textbook balanced on top of his head. For both cases, the student had to maintain the respective positions until the teacher released him. as primary one kids, we obeyed her out of fear and dared not slack during punishments, fearing that she would punish us even more if we did...</p>
              <p>needless to say, there were times where u can find several students being punished tgr for not answering her qns correctly...in such cases, they would stand along both sides of the blackboard, either holding up their textbooks or balancing them on their heads. the teacher would proceed wif the lesson. i was a victim of such a few times tat yr and i remember that my arms felt quite tired after the punishment...</p>
              <p>if this teacher lived in the modern generation, i wonder if she would still keep her job...</p>

              generation of teachers who believed tat punishments were needed to
              teach n guide students...i remember that most of her students were
              fearful of her as she nvr had any qualms abt punishing us. she had
              a wide range of punishments and we nvr knew how she would punish
              us...</p>
              <p>i remember how scared we would be whenever she asked any of us a
              qn...she had the habit of doing tat at the start of most
              lessons...she would randomly pick students to answer qns on
              the previous lesson. we were expected to revise our work after
              every lesson and students who couldnt answer the qns correctly
              would be punished. there were 2 common punishments she would give
              for this. she would scold the student for not revising his work and
              then order him to stand at a corner in front of the class and
              either 1) hold up his textbook above his head, keeping his arms
              straight up or 2) stand at a corner in front of class wif textbook
              balanced on top of his head. For both cases, the student had to
              maintain the respective positions until the teacher released him.
              as primary one kids, we obeyed her out of fear and dared not slack
              during punishments, fearing that she would punish us even more if
              we did...</p>
              <p>needless to say, there were times where u can find several
              students being punished tgr for not answering her qns
              correctly...in such cases, they would stand along both sides of the
              blackboard, either holding up their textbooks or balancing them on
              their heads. the teacher would proceed wif the lesson. i was a
              victim of such a few times tat yr and i remember that my arms felt
              quite tired after the punishment...</p>
              <p>if this teacher lived in the modern generation, i wonder if she
              would still keep her job...</p>

              Oh the raise hands punishment seemed to be common during our times. It's like the traditional Korean punishments where the student must kneel down and raise hands. However, this punishment did not seem to happen often in my primary school. Even if it happened, the student would need to raise hands for a few minutes. The teacher did that just to scare them. I guess my primary school was very lenient and slack in discipline. How long must you raise your hands?

              The tip-toe punishment is more creative as I never came across before. I wonder if other teachers in her school will copy this idea. Perhaps it will become the most famous punishment of this era? Haha...

              That was in Year 2000 when she was just 19 and still waiting for A levels results. I guess it still happens nowadays in some schools but generally most schools do not allow that to happen.

              Yup, both of us are of the same age. I was studying in the poly at that time and had not known her. I guess she is a strict person as she told me that she used to cane her little brother who refused to study hard. She also said that the school she had been relief-teaching in is a notorious neighbourhood secondary school which is very different from the elite all-girls secondary school which she is from. In that case, I wonder how she got the idea of making her students stand on chair as it wouldn't have happened in her sec sch. Perhaps it happened in her pri sch or she just followed what other teachers did? Most teachers will just make them stand outside classroom and not on chair. Haha...
              
              BTW, r u also of the same age as me? You seemed to reply very fast for my previous few posts.

              <p>Chasing the student out of the class is the most ineffective punishment. It isn't even a punishment at all actually - the student gets the privilege of having his own private space along the corridor, and he doesn't have to even pretend that he is listening to whatever the teacher is saying.</p>
              <p>Worst of all is when a student gets sent out of the class for forgetting his/her materials/text/whatever. It merely serves to deny the student the right to learn. But this applies to all punishments that seeks to cause physical strain which causes them to lose their mental concentration.</p>
