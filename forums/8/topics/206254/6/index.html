            <div class='col-md body'>actually from wad i noe, the form of class of tat teacher is always the main 'victim'... according to my info, the teacher will mark out wif chalk at the start of every yr the specific positions for punishments to take place. she would draw out circles on the floor at the frony n back of the classroom. from wad i heard, she would usually mark out enuff for 10 students...<br><br>so when a student is to be punished, the teacher would order him/her either to the front or back of classroom. the student will go to one of the positions marked n do the punishment there. its at these marked positions where kneeling or knee-bending will take place. wads even more interesting is tat the teacher allocated 2 positions for the harshest punishment of all. on these 2 marked positions, she would stick 2 marbles n 2 bottle caps on the marked spots wif double-sided tape. so when a unrepentant offender is being punished, he/she will be ordered to either of these positions for punishment.<br><br>for knee-bending punishments, the student will go to 1 of these positions n the teacher will put a chair next to him. the student will then bend his legs down to the level of the chair. the chair will then be removed n the student is to stay in tat position thruÃ³ut. from wad i noe, knee-bending is extremely tiring n painful cos its usually accompanied either wif the student's arms being outstretched n his sch bag place on top of his hands or wif the student lifting his bag above his head. most who went thru tis punishment ended up in tears. gals though r usually nt given tis punishment...<br><br>gals r usually asked to kneel. they r nt asked to knee-bend due tot he fact tat they r wearing skirts. but even then, the gals r stil nt able to withstand the punishments meted out...from here we can see the intensity n harshness of the punishments. the sucess rate of deterring the students was often very high...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>according to my frend n his classmates, the most torturing punishments r the kneeling on marbles n knee-bending while lifting bag above head. my frend himself was ordered to knee-bend wif bag above his head for nt bringing his bk for 3rd time. from wad he told me, tis punishment is realli unbearable. within 5min, his legs n arms were alredi quite tired. however, the teacher ensured his hands were kept straight up n legs bent properly. needless to say, he ended up in tears n it was onli less than 15min. the teacher kept him there for a full 20min b4 releasing him. even then he wasnt allowed to return to his seat. the teacher made him kneel on one of the marked spots n pull his ears for the rest of the lesson. my frend can nvr forget tat incident...<br><br>surprisingly, slapping is nt the worse punishment in terms of pain. cos for slapping, the student can 'cheat' a bit. as long as the slaps produce a sound loud enuff for the teacher to hear, she will let it pass. so the slaps dun have to be very hard though on the long run, they stil do hurt the cheeks. there were incidents though when serious offences were committed n the teacher insisted slaps were hard n painful...<br><br>serious offences n unrepentant offenders were often dealt wif very severely. punishments will be extremely painful n wil last for long periods. my frend n some of his classmates were victims of such punishments as they were culprits of serious offences n repeated offences(like the case above). serious offences include vulgarities, fighting in class, playing truant, rudeness to teacher...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the teacher has been teaching for abt 20 yrs nw. if she could be kicked out, she would have been long ago. ppl have complained abt her but strangely, she has nvr lost her job. from wad i noe, she is always able to offer gd explanation for her harsh punishments. moreover, she has been delivering the gd results over these yrs n students have become better ppl after being punished by her. the sch has improved in discipline n results...so i guess she will remain in the teaching world until she retires...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting topic...brings back the memories. ..Here's some of the more classic/amusing punishment I seen or have experienced.<br><br>1. Everyone who talks will be sent outside the class....so we purposely get sent out of the and continue our chats there. The record was 40% of the class were outside chitchatting happily<br><br>2. I was punished for wearing a PE shirt inside the uniform because the weather is hot....wtf right??!!!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i alredi said ppl did complain but no use cos she has always produced gd results. n students have become better behaved after being taught by her. there were even students who had crush for her cos of her dressing(see my earlier post) n her pleasant looks. like i said b4, as long as the students dun make her angry, she is very pleasant n nice...<br><br>she has advanced in age nw though so she no longer looks as pleasant as she used to but her dressing is stil as b4...smart formal wear.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sorri all these have been tried b4. no success...apparently she is hated by students but well-liked by moe n principal cos she can deliver the 'goods'. well, her lessons were actually quite interesting n at times hilarious...she can make the whole class burst out laughing at her jokes. students on the whole enjoy the humour she brings except of cos for those being punished. laughing is the last thing they can do.<br><br>she even takes the trouble to give extra lessons to weaker students n she nvr scolds anyone for asking silly qns. in fact, she encourages students to ask qns n to participate in class.<br><br>so as we can all see, she is a gd teacher n takes extra efforts to make students achieve gd results. perhaps the onli thing she is hated for is her harsh punishments. but as long as u dun commit any offence, u will like tis teacher...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>spare the rod and spoil the child. i prefer the old school fashion of caning when the kids do something wrong. thats how most of us and our parents were brought up and i'll say its rather effective.<br></blockquote>i beg to differ...even though caning inflicts pain n shame, the pain dun last very long...but the pain inflicted from tis teacher's punishments last very long usually for the rest of the day. tis is more effective as the student will be reminded nt to repeat the offence.<br><br>anyway, the teacher has become the school's DM le. from wad i noe, she doesnt realli believe in caning...she stil trust more in the prolonged, painful n tiring punishments she often mete out in class. of cuz caning hasnt been abolished...juz tat its nt so frequently used anymore wif those harsh punishments as substitutes.<br><br>n those punishments have proven effective. students who played truant, caught smoking n caught fighting in sch have been dealt wif so severely tat hardly any in sch dared to do such things. there was an incident of 2 boys caught smoking outside sch. they were marched into the DM office. tis teacher made them kneel on marbles outside her office n carry their bags above their heads. on top of tat, they each had to hold 5 unlit cigarettes btw their lips thru out the punishment! guess how long they were punished??? for HALF A MORNING!!! from the time assembly ended at abt 745am until recess time at ard 10am! u can imagine the pain n suffering those 2 boys went thru...worse than being caned...<br><br>in fact, the teacher even made special arrangements tat day for all her classes during that punishment period to be held outside her office. so for tat 2 hrs or so, u could see classes going to the DM office to have their lessons outside. she did tis so tat she could keep an eye on the 2 boys. according to my frend, those 2 boys were nt given any rest at all. when his class had their lessons tat morning, those 2 boys were seen crying thru out. the onli thing the teacher did to ease their agony was to allow them to shift their arms occasionally. from lifting their bags abvoe their heads, she would change it to putting their bags on top of their outstretched arms. she would do tis every half hr. however, they were kept kneeling on the marbles thru out wif legs bent at 90 degrees....so isnt it true tat tis punishment acts as a better deterrent than caning?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>abt the case of 2 boys being punished for smoking, someone my frend knew actually witnessed them being punished...he had gone to the bkshop to buy sth after seeking permission from his teacher n walked past the DM office. there, he saw the DM marching the 2 boys to her office. curious, he hid at 1 corner to look...<br><br>(DM approaches her office wif the boys following her, carrying their schbags)<br><br>DM: WAIT OUTSIDE HERE FOR ME!!!<br>(went into office n came out moments later, holding some marbles in her hands. marbles were placed on the floor)<br><br>DM: KNEEL ON THEM!!! TAKE UR SCHBAGS N CARRY THEM ABOVE UR HEADS!!!<br>(students obliged)<br><br>DM: KEEP UR HANDS STRAIGHT UP!!! KNEEL PROPERLY!!!<br>(she then takes out the cigarette boxes she confiscated from the boys, takes out 10 cigarettes n put 5 into each of the boys mouths)<br><br>DM: YOU BOYS LIKE TO SMOKE RITE?? HOLD THESE CIGARETTES WIF UR MOUTHS!!! I WANT TO SEE THEM BTW UR LIPS AT ALL TIMES!!! IF ANY DROP OUT, U WILL GET IT FROM ME!!!<br><br>DM then proceeded wif the 1st lesson of the day...leaving the boys suffering in agony...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>to add on the case above, the boys were positioned in a way tat they had no chance of slacking without being noticed. according to my frend who was one of those who had to go to DM office for lesson tat day, the DM made the students sit on the floor during lesson. she took for herself a moveable whiteboard, a chair n a classroom table...so lesson was conducted in such a setting...<br><br>those 2 boys were made to kneel on both sides of the table next to the teacher's seat. so the teacher had a very gd view of them while she taught. also they were made to face the class. although they did look kinda funny being punished, hardly anyone laughed, fearing they may end up being punished as well...thru out the lesson, the teacher would glance at the boys to make sure they were nt slacking. according to my frend, those boys realli had a horrid time. they were crying buckets of tears in extreme pain from prolonged kneeling n lifting of bags above their heads. yet not a min of rest was given to them...the teacher made sure their hands were kept straight up n legs bent at 90 degrees. she scolded them each time she caught them slacking...<br><br>worse was to come, after giving the class work to do, the teacher went to inspect the boys. my frend saw tat the marbles they were kneeling on had shifted to the side of their knees. the teacher then repositioned the marbles back to the center of their knees n made the boys straighten their arms to the fullest...she picked up the cigarettes tat the boys had dropped from their mouths n scolded them for dropping them...then she added a few more cigarettes to the ones she picked up n made the boys hold them wif their lips b4 proceeding to mark her bks...my frend could see the grimace in the boys' faces. the extreme pain was obviously unbearable. yet, the teacher warned them nt to slack or drop any cigarettes or she will make them stay tat way until the end of sch...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, the case of smoking was used as a stern warning to all the students then. after tat incident, hardly anyone dared to commit serious offences. there were still a few serious offences tat were committed n they were dealt wif in similar ways...<br><br>there was a case of bullying then. it was a big case as it involvesd 6 sch bullies...4 boys n 2 gals.they were caught bullying a junior boy outside sch by the DM. they were paraded the next morning during assembly..<br><br>after assembly tat morning, they were marched to the DM office for punishment. the DM did wad she always did for serious offences...she made all of them kneel on marbles outside her office. however, tis time the punishment was abit diff from the smoking case. instead of lifting their bags above their heads, they were asked to slap each other. they were ordered to kneel facing each other in pairs. the 2 gals paired up wif each other. then they were ordered to slap each other simultaneously as hard as they could. 1 student wil 1st slap his partner then be slapped back in return. they were made to do tis for HALF A MORNING... from wad i noe, within half hr, all 6 of them were crying in pain.<br><br>as the above case, the DM had her lessons outside her office tat half morning. according to my frend, the slaps were rather hard. from where they sat, they could hear the slapping. as usual the DM allowed no slacking from the students. she kept making sure they knelt properly on the marbles n tat their slaps were hard n painful. at one glace, it was obvious how swollen their cheeks were. n the slaps were nt juz simultaneous, they were in sequence. 1st the left cheek then the rite...the 2 gals especially were crying so much in pain nt juz from the pain coming from the slaps n prolonged kneeling but also from their aching arms. the 4 boys were nt much better as they also cried buckets...<br><br>from these 2 cases, its evident tat this teacher treats serious offences very severely. she metes out the harshest punishments u can ever tink of...they proved effective though as serious offences became few n far btw...</div>
