              ok...i am back wif the 1st of 2 more cases involving tat chinese teacher who tot me in pri 1...tis case took place few yrs later when we were in pri 4...according to one of my former clasmate, 2 of his classmates in pri 4 were punished rather harshly by tis teacher for showing her disrespect along the corridor...
              
              it happened midway thru the morning. the bell had rang for recess n students were seen making their way to the canteen. 2 of my frend's classmates decided to race to the canteen. as they ran, they met the teacher who sternly ordered them to stop n stand in front of her. she then proceeded to reprimand them for running along the corridor n making a lot of noise. surprisingly, she didnt punish them at all but let them go wif a stern warning. instead of thanking their lucky stars, those 2 boys began to make faces behind the teacher n one of them muttered in chinese:"Da Zui Ba Lao Shi!"(Big-Mouth teacher). unfortunately for him, the teacher heard wad he muttered n turned ard angrily, onli to catch them making faces at her.
              
              the aftermath was more or less expected. the teacher was infuriated n scolded them very harshly. she scolded them for being disrespectful to her n then ordered them to stand along the corridor while she went into the teacher's room to put down her things. moments later, she came out n told the boys tat she was going to punish them for wad they did. she made them stand along the corridor n slap themselves hard. she ordered them to keep slapping themselves until she came back and warned them not to cheat while she was away...
              
              my frend recalled tat the teacher returned less than 5min later. she had gone to get a table from a classroom n she placed it btw where the boys were standing. then she went into the teacher's room n brought out a porcelain fish tat had a big, opened mouth. she put the fish on the table n beckoned the boys to stand next to it. then as punishment for calling her big-mouth teacher n making faces at her, she ordered the boys to pull the corners of their mouths apart wif their fingers n recite "my mouth is bigger!"(wo de zui ba bi jiao da) in chinese 300times each! they were to take turns to recite the sentence while bending towards the fish. she then left them instructions to shout out clearly each time n to report to her once they had finished shouting out the sentence 300times each...
              
              it was a very horrid time for the 2 boys...they felt very stupid n embarrassed facing a porcelain fish n shouting "wo de zui ba bi jiao da!" it was indeed a very interesting punishment although it was certainly a very harsh one. my frend recalled tat the boys were seemingly tired after having shouted out 300times each. when they reported to the teacher after they had completed, the teacher even told them tat she felt like making them stay back after school and continue shouting out the sentence another 1000times...cos she felt there was a need to punish them until they will remember for the rest of their lives not to be disrespectful to their teachers...
              
              well, in the end, the teacher didnt carry out wad she threatened...she decided to let them go after making them apologise for being disrespectful n promise tat they will not perform such acts of disrespect again...she left them wif a stern warning tat if she ever see such acts from them again, she will make them shout out the sentence outside the teacher's room from recess time until end of school...would she have carried out wad she threatened we do not noe. however wad we do noe was tat the 2 boys felt utterly embarrassed as many students walked past them n sniggered at them while they were being punished...

              b4 i cite the 2nd case involving tat chinese teacher who taught me in pri 1, i would like to switch back to my chinese tutor who tutored me in secondary school...as i shared earlier, she belonged to the older generation of teachers n hence was rather strict wif her students, both in school n also those she tutored. i also shared several incidents where she punished her students for various offences, some of which were related by her to us...
              
              to add on, i remembered tat as she shared wif us, we also probed further into wad she shared. we found out tat while most of those whom she had punished were male students, there were a few occasions where female students were punished. although caning was onli reserved for male students, our tutor shared tat other forms of punishments were given to both genders wif equal measure... 
              
              our tutor recalled a case tat involved a rebellious secondary 1 gal whom she taught. tis gal hated studying n often refused to do her hmwork. she had a younger bro who was also being tutored. according to our tutor, she was hired to teach n discipline tis gal as she was in danger of slipping into the normal technical stream. our tutor recalled tat she had a hard time disciplining n guiding her. punishments were rather frequent and got to the pt where they began to lose effect on tis gal. our tutor had to set a rule tat each time she attended lessons without her hmwork done, she will stand n do her hmwork during lesson time. she was onli allowed to sit down when she had completed her work.
              
              tis went on for some time until one particular day when our tutor went to the gal's place to conduct lessons. her younger bro informed our tutor tat his sis had nt returned hm from sch yet. shortly after, the gal came hm. our tutor asked y she came hm so late n whether she did her hmwork. instead of answering her qns, the gal rebelliously retorted "y u bother? u tink i dunno wad u wan? stand onli mah! stand, stand lor!!!" our tutor could nt believe wad the gal said. she was very furious n scolded her severely. in the end, she granted the gal her wish by telling her tat since she liked standing so much, she will stand at a corner for the entire lesson. moreover, our tutor meted out more punishment by making the gal hold up her schbag above her head. she ordered her to keep her hands straight up n warned tat if she dared bent her arms, she will be punished in the same manner the next lesson.
              
              well, as expected, the gal could not keep her hands straight up for very long. my tutor recalled tat after abt 20min, she saw tears in the gal's eyes. it was obvious her arms were hurting alot n could no longer hold the bag up much longer. hence, she allowed the gal to put her schbag down but the gal was kept standing at the corner. after abt 10min, our tutor told the gal tat the earlier punishment was to punish her for not doing her hmwork. nw, she was going to punish her for being rebellious n rude. then, she ordered the gal to slap herself continuously. our tutor could nt rem how long the slapping lasted but she was sure it lasted longer than the 1st punishment...
              
              our tutor concluded tis account by saying tat in the end, the gal was made to stand in the corner until the end of the lesson, which was almost 2hrs!!! as we heard tis account, we could not imagine a gal going thru all tat although we felt tat the gal deserved to be punished harshly. thru our probing, we gathered more info abt tis case which i will share in my next post...

            <div class='col-md body'>
              ok...to continue from above, our tutor shared tat it took her almost a whole yr to take tat gal in hand. the gal was very stubborn n simply refused to yield initially. our tutor had to be very strict wif her n fortunately, she had a secret weapon. u see, the gal's parents could nt take her in hand n was tempted to send her to girls' home on grounds tat she was beyond control. the gal herself knew wad it was like in the girls' home as she heard stories from her frends. hence, she was rather fearful abt going to girls' hm...
              
              our tutor had to resort to threatening the gal tat if she still continue to be so rebellious, she wil report her to her parents n tell the parents to send her to the girls' hm...the gal would end up giving in n do her hmwork albeit very reluctantly. our tutor recalled how the gal would sit n do her hmwork, sobbing at the same time. she didnt wan to obey but knew tat if she didnt obey, she might end up in the girls' hm...
              
              our tutor did have compliments for tat gal though. tat gal was a very gd older sis to her bro. according to our tutor, she doted on him alot n would play the role of a parent when her parents were nt ard. she would buy food for him, bring him to the doctor when he was ill n help him wif his hmwork(even though she hated studying). there were times when her bro would plead on her behalf when she was being punished by our tutor. as mentioned above, punishments were rather frequent for tis gal n our tutor added tat she punished the gal in almost every possible way she knew of...they included writing lines, standing at a corner, ear pulling, slapping of cheeks n even kneeling...our tutor was even tempted to cane the gal but refrained from doing tat as she was female.
              
              in my next post, i will share more abt our tutor's rationale in punishing her students the way she did...

              <p>This is an interesting topic. Most school punishments mentioned in this thread are standing, pulling ears, raising hands up / carry schoolbag above the head or any combinations of these.</p>
              <p>Anyone came across punishments like standing on chair/table?</p>
              <p>One interesting one I know of was the teacher made student stand inside a small circle she drew on the floor and it really made the student's legs tired after a while beacuse the circle is so small that he cannot move his legs. It seems like female teachers usually like to make people stand and have creative punishments like these. :D</p>

              to snoopy 81...
              
              what u mentioned is somewad similar to the standing punishment my chinese tutor gave to some of her students. the onli diff is tat she didnt draw any circle on the floor. however, it must be noted tat when she made any of us stand, she would expect us to stand wif our legs tgr and both legs had to be kept straight at all times. she would not onli scold us each time she caught us standing wif one leg bent but also ensured tat we resumed the proper way of standing...
              
              one qn for u, snoopy81...how long did the teacher u mentioned make the student stand? my tutor back then made several of her students stand in the manner mentioned above for more than an hr. for my frend's bro's case, he had to stand for abt one n a half hrs! the rebellious gal mentioned in an above post also stood for an entire lesson, lasting abt the same duration.
              
              i agree wif u tat female teachers tend to be rather creative wif punishments. in fact, most of the punishments mentioned in tis thread were meted out by female teachers. they seem to prefer meteing out a variety of punishments which could be embarrassing, tiring, painful or any combination of these 3...as i mentioned, my tutor did tell us her rationale for meteing out harsh punishments at times which i will share soon...meantime, keep ur posts coming...

              Hi despondent...
              
              Yeah seems like standing punishments are the most common. I know its tiring to stand at attention. By the way, standing punishment is suppose to make you embarasses and legs tired at the same time right? Therefore, must stand at attention then considered punishment right?
              
              Hm... I think the student stood for the entire lesson which could be somewhere between 1 to 3 periods (30 mins to 90 mins). A teacher will usually punish the student to stand for the entire lesson right? I wonder if there's any teacher who will let the student sit down if he really stand properly for a period of time.
              
              I guess females are more creative and therefore their punishments are creative as well. Female teachers usually don't cane but will mete out punishments which last for longer duration like standing and of course embarrassing and tiring! Haha.. better not get punished by female teachers.
              
              By the way, 1 of my female friend shared with me the idea of punishing a naughty kid to stand on one leg for 30 mins. Fortunately she is not a teacher or tutor. I asked her if any of her teachers used this punishment before and she said it was her own idea. See how creative girls are!

            <div class='col-md body'>
              Refering to my previous post, I did ask my female friend whether making a naughty kid stand on one leg for 30 mins is too long and whether she allow the kid to change leg halfway. Her answer was that 30 mins will be long enough for the kid to remember and learn the lesson and she will not allow him to change leg halfway. I also asked her what if the kid put down his leg halfway. In that case, she will make the kid hold something (eg. textbook).
              
              Is this punishment considered creative and too harsh?

              hi snoopy...
              
              thanks for ur posts...well, i must 1st state tat most teachers i encountered did not ensure students stood at attention when being punished. so far, my tutor was the onli one i ever encountered. most teachers would just get the student to stand for a certain duration but they dun realli care if the student was standing with one leg bent or not. at most, they would ensure tat the student did not lean against anything while standing...
              
              i did also encounter some teachers who did not punish students for the whole lesson. my form teacher in pri 3-4 believed in releasing us early if we did the punishment properly. it must be noted tat not all punishments can be done properly for the entire lesson. for eg, u cun expect a student to carry the schbag above his head, keeping both hands straight for 2 entire periods!!! i noe of frends who had to keep their hands raised straight up(without their schbags)for an entire period. they were close to tears at the end of it. tis can also be said of kneeling punishments where the student is expected to kneel at 90 degrees to the floor. u cun expect him to do tat for 2 entire periods. at most u can keep him kneeling for 2 periods but allow him to kneel wif his butt on his heels now n then...
              
              standing seems to be the onli punishment tat is reasonable enuff to be done for long durations. while standing for very long periods can be very tiring, it does not cause any physical injury. moreover, standing is a punishment tat can be used for very long periods without the student not being able to pay attention or follow the lesson...tis i will elaborate when i share abt my tutor's rationale for meteing harsh punishments...

              hi despondent, I guess u're right. Standing does not cause any physical injury so it's most commonly used. Just to add on, I have another female friend who tried relief teaching after her A-levels. Because of her young age, she was bullied by her class until she became so angry that she punished 5 boys to stand on chair outside classroom. Even so, the 5 boys did not stand properly and kept stepping down. Therefore, she had to draw circle on the floor and if they step down, they'll leave footprints unless they jump which will make quite a lot of noise and she would know from inside the classroom. Isn't this a creative punishment?
              
              Refer to my previous post of the standing on one leg punishment for 30 mins, isn't it creative and too harsh?

            <div class='col-md body'>harsh yes, creative not realli...i noe tat in the military, standing on one leg is used as a way to punish personnel who do not stand properly during drills or parades. yet having said tat, to do it to kids is rather harsh...one thing i wonder is whether its possible for the kid to maintain balance for 30min?</div>

              hi despondent
              
              Yeah, standing on one leg can be really torture because all the body weight is exerted on the only leg. Oh gosh, I can't imagine standing on one leg and then go off balance and end up having to hold textbooks for more intense punishments! Haha... she even jokingly said that she wanted to make me do that one day. :D

            <div class='col-md body'>Hm... I also reliased that being punished to stand, the girls will usually stand properly with legs together even if not instructed to and boys usually get tired easily and tend to move about. Maybe girls have stronger leg power. Hehe...</div>

              <p>Anyone came across punishments like standing on chair/table?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>when i was at primary school, i was really naughty. my teachers kept asking me to stand on chair.. haha and i remember i was really really naughty that i would make funny2 faces up there.. then she would ask me to stand on the table.. haha.. idk y last time i didnt mind at all.. coz like i was still very young, i guess? like pri6..</p>
              <p>i got punishment standing for 2 periods also.. man, so tiring, i tell you.. *sighs*</p>
              <p>oh yea, btw, i heard from my friend that her friend's tuition teacher would ask them to stand on a chair in the toilet.. if the students never study properly, the teacher would ask him/her to strip (as in naked) while studying.. idk how true this is, but that's really scary man..</p>

              <p>Physical punishment should be allowed. People simply do not have the judgement to decide if it's appropriate or not.</p>
              <p>They
              should be able to punish students who are out of line appropriately
              however. Maybe lock them in a room with nothing to do or something.
              Counciling is the best option IMO</p>
