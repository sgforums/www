            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">i recall a case way back wheni was in kindergarten...i remember i was in K2 back then...we were having our chinese lesson when the bell rang signalling break time...hence, we lined up in an orerly manner to get our food...after all of us had taken our food n gone back to our seats to consume it, i remember asking the teacher for permission to go to the toilet...so i went nt noeing wad was in store later...<br><br>when i returned to class, i noticed there was a commotion...walking to my seat, i saw one of my classmate standing in the middle of the classroom...the teacher was in front, scolding him...she scolded him for playing a fool in class instead of sitting at his seat quietly...it turned out tat while i was away, he was making faces at some of our classmates...it ended up wif the teacher ordering him to stand in the middle of the classroom...as a punishment for wad he did, she ordered him to stick his tongue out n to keep it stuck out since he enjoyed making faces at others...<br><br>it was a funny sight!!! i remember tat within a few minutes, saliva was dripping from the tip of his tongue...the student had to constantly wipe off the saliva from his chin...by then many of us were giggling at him...even the teacher laughed at wad she saw...yet despite the 'sufferings', the teacher sternly ordered the student to keep his tongue stuck out...she then ordered the rest of the class to keep silent...<br><br>the student was finally released from his 'sufferings' after abt another 5min...by then, there were tears in his eyes...it was obvious his tongue felt dry n tired..the teacher onli released him after making him promise nt to make faces at his classmates again...i remember the teacher warning him tat if he did such a thing again, she would punish him even more severely...<br></div><div class="quote_body">well, the punishment did prove effective for a long while but its always hard for old habits to die which we shall see in my next post..</div></blockquote>the above incident was repeated later in tat yr though in a slightly different setting...i recall that we were receiving our test papers...as the scripts were given out one by one, the student mentioned above went up to get his...as he went back to his seat after looking at his marks, he begam making faces at the student sitting next to him, indicating tat he had scored higher...<br><br>unfortunately for him, the teacher saw wad he did...recalling wad happened earlier tat yr, she ordered the student to stand next to her table n await his punishment while she finished giving out the test scripts...minutes later, the teacher was seen scolding the student...she reminded him of the previous warning she gave him n then ordered him to go get his textbk...wad followed after tat was unimagineable...the teacher ordered the student to stand along the corridor outside the classroom n stick his tongue out...on top of tat he had to pull his ears n balance the textbk on his head...the teacher instructed sternly tat if the bk fell off, the student would be in greater trouble...<br><br>it was much worse tis time ard...the student was punished for almost the rest of the lesson!!! in fact, the bk did fall off once during the punishment...the teacher went up to the student n scolded him for dropping the bk...she then placed the bk back on his head n ordered him to stand wif his knees bent...tis lasted onli abt 5min b4 the teacher allowed him to straighten his legs...i stil remember seeing how the student cried towards the end...saliva was seen dripping from the tip of his tongue..it was a disgusting sight...i remember the teacher asking him if he enjoyed sticking his tongue out n if he wanted to continue doing tat for another period...the student shook his head, crying...<br><br>the teacher finally released the student from his agony...she removed the bk from his head n allowed him to withdraw his tongue...however, he wasnt allowed back into the class..the teacher kept him standing outside the class n pull his ears until the end of tat period...when he was allowed back into class, u could see the 'sufferings' on his face...it was a horrid experience for him but it proved effective as he nvr made faces in class again in tat yr...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>i recall an incident in primary sch...it was during a prize presentation rehearsal...when we went to the hall for rehearsal, we saw 2 boys each standing at 1 corner of the stage on top pulling their ears...we later found out tat they were being punished by the teacher-in-charge of the rehearsal. to make it worse, the teacher made them stand facing us. we could see how embarrassed they were. n the teacher kept thenm there thru out the entire rehearsal!!! so while we were rehearsing, those 2 boys were being punished. can u imagine how embarrassed they muz have felt?? n how tired they muz have been for standing for such a long period??? again, it was done by a female teacher...hmmm...y do female teachers seem to believe in psychological punsihments rather than physical ones?</blockquote>the above is quoted from a post written last yr...i remember tat the teacher mentioned above taught my class onli one subject thru out my stay in primary sch. actually i found her rather nice although i have also seen the ugly side of her. i recall that she was also a form teacher. i personally witnessed students being punished by her on several occasions. very often she sould make them stand outside the classroom n pull their ears. it seemed to be her favourite punishment...<br><br>yet i noe for a fact that she doesnt punish students excessively. she was one who would give grace for toking in class, nt bringing bks or nt doing hmwork...however, she had her limits n although she was generally nice, she could be realli nasty when pushed beyond her limit...there were cases when she meted harsher punishments to repeated offenders...in fact the case quoted above was a result of unrepentant offenders...the 2 boys were fond of playing a fool in class n they had been scolded n punished b4 previously...<br><br>on tat fateful day, the 2 boys were chasing each other ard the classroom n making fun of their classmates along the way...in the midst of it, the teacher stepped into the classroom n saw their rowdy behaviour...the teacher was furious. after leaving the relief teacher to look after the class, she ordered the 2 boys to follow her to the school hall where the prize presentation rehearsal was to take place...<br><br>once they arrived at the hall, the teacher walked them to the centre of the stage..she ordered them to stand there, facing the hall n pull their ears...i must say that those 2 boys realli deserved to be punished...they didnt show signs of remorse...i recall that after the 1st round of rehearsal, the boys were seen smiling n toking to each other...their actions were seen by the teacher...furious, she went up the stage n smacked the 2 boys on their shoulders...after a brief scolding, she pulled one of the boys to one corner of the stage n ordered him to stand there n pull his ears while facing the hall...the same thing was done to the other boy at the other corner of the stage...wad was harsh was tat the 2 boys were made to stand n pull their ears for the ENTIRE rehearsal!! i recall tat the rehearsal was more than an hr long n the boys did look tired towards the end from the punishment...<br><br>the above was one of the cases when the teacher showed her true colours...i can stil recall one more case when the teacher turned nasty...tis happened to my classmate in tat yr when she taught us...will post tis soon...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hello, yup i am back to give an account of the case i mentioned in my above post. first of all, i muz state that the teacher being mentioned taught my class onli one subject tat yr n she onli came into our class once a wk. her lessons were an hr long(double periods). i recall tat even when she punished us, she usually would nt punish us for the entire 2 periods. usually she would punish us for one period at the most. moreover, she usually resorted to punishments onli when it was a repeated offence...<br><br>however, i remember a case tat yr when she punished a student for the entire 2 periods...he was a repeated offender. moreover, he made things worse by disobeying her orders and slacking when doing punishment. the teacher came into class tat day n told us to hand in our hmwork...this student was found nt to have done his hmwork again...previously, the teacher had let him off lightly...the 1st time he was given a warning n his name was recorded down. the 2nd time, he was made to stand n pull his ears in front of the class for nearly one period. for tis case, the teacher was realli furious n scolded him quite badly. tis time she sent him out of the class...he was asked to stand in the middle of the corridor and pull his ears...<br><br>abt halfway thru the 1st period, the teacher saw the student slacking...he was standing on one leg n he was merely holding on to both his ears wif onli 2 fingers...infuriated, the teacher went out of the class...she scolded him for slacking n ordered him to stand properly...initially she ordered him to pull his ears harder but then changed her mind...she ordered him to raise up both his hands and to keep them straight up...after giving a final warning nt to slack, the teacher went back into the classroom...<br><br>in the end, the student had to keep his hands raised for abt half an hr!!! in fact, the teacher would have kept him at it until end of lesson if he had nt shown signs of weariness n pain. moreover, the teacher onli allow him to put his hands down after he promised to pull his ears properly...so in the end, the student spent abt the last 15min standing outside the class n pulling his ears hard...he was let off onli at the end of the lesson...on top of tat, the teacher made him stay back after sch to complete his hmwork...he was made stand at his table n do his hmwork...<br><br>tat was the onli cae tat yr tat the teacher showed her true colours...but i felt the student deserved it though i feel the punishment was rather harsh...yet, given his rebellion n disobedience, such a punishment was needed to teach him a lesson...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok...so from punishments in schools, i move on to punishments outside sch...they occur anywhere other than in school, like on tv, magazines or in real life...i believe we have many of such experiences to share esp for those who read alot n watch shows alot...from the shows i have watched i can remember many occasions when punishments were involved...below is one of them...will cite the rest in time to come...<br><br>i recall a show i watched several years back...the leading actress in tat show was Chingmy Yau...1st i muz say tat i have onli seen tis show once on tv...its nt one of those shows tat has been shown repeatedly over time...anyway, in tat show Chingmy Yau acted as the daughter of a triad leader...she was a spoilt n wilful child who possessed some fighting skills...in tis show, there were 2 incidents when 3 men fell victims to chingmy's wilfulness...they were punished by her in 2 separate incidents...<br><br>1) Chingmy n her bf in tat show(cun rem his name) were at a pub drinking n dancing...after they were done wif dancing, they walked towards the bar counter to get some drinks...as they approached, they saw 2 men having a dispute wif a young woman...in the end both the men hit the woman who landed on the floor...Chingmy n her bf saw tis n confronted the 2 men...after some verbal exchange, the 2 men tried to run away...the younger one ran off 1st but b4 the older one could react, Chingmy's bf pressed a pistol against his back...the older man ordered his younger counterpart to come back...by tis time, a huge crowd had gathered to watch the scene...when the younger man returned, Chingmy started to punish him. she landed blows on him n beat him until he was bruised. the young man was left lying on the floor, rolling about in pain...<br><br>the punishment Chingmy gave to the older man was even better. she went over to him after beating up his younger counterpart...her bf still had his pistol pressed against his back...he handed a wine bottle to her...below is the dialogue she had wif the older man(i rem the content but nt exact words)<br><br>Chingmy(wine bottle in hand): which hand did u use to when u hit tat woman just nw? raise it up!!! (man raised up both his hands which were tattooed)<br>Chingmy: wow, u have so many tattoos on ur hands...(smashed the wine bottle on the man's hands)<br>man: AAARRRGGGHHHH!!! (his hands were bleeding)<br>Chingmy: DO U DARE HIT A WOMAN IN FUTURE???<br>man(shaking his head): no...<br>Chingmy: SLAP URSELF!!! (man reluctantly obliged) SLAP HARDER!!! (man slapped harder) SLAP UNTIL WE LEAVE THIS PLACE!!! (man nodded)<br><br>Chingmy gestured her bf to leave...they began walking to towards the exit...Chingmy turned and looked at the man sternly, who was still slapping himself...<br>Chingmy(to the man): DUN STOP, UNDERSTAND??<br><br>she then left the place wif her bf...tis is the 1st incident when Chingmy meted punishments in tat show...will post the 2nd case shortly...</div>

Students are caught doing something, the case is written into the cockpit, registered. If the appropraite actions are not carried out, the school would have to answer for it, that would be a hassle.<br><br>SO the smart thing to do is not to create any trouble, cos that means trouble for everyone, so the school wants to steer clear of these trouble, thus, we received the punishment<br><br>This is from my Point of view, correct me if im wrong.

            <div class='col-md body'>ok, i wil nw carry on from the 1st case involving chingmy yau in tat show...the 2nd case was much shorter although by no means less dramatic...tis happened near the end of the show...Chingmy was speeing in her sports car when she was halted by a traffic police...after some interrogation, the traffic police demanded chingmy to hand over her driving license...then he proceeded to issue a summon...<br><br>alas for him, as soon as he had finished writing down chingmy's particulars, a pistol was pressed against his stomach...frightened, the policeman begged chingmy to let him off...chingmy agreed to let him off if he promised not to issue the summon...then as a punishment, chingmy ordered the policeman to tear up the summon n eat up the paper...wif the pistol pressed against him, the policeman had no choice but to obliged...wif some difficulty, he managed to eat up the paper...after seeing tis, chingmy finally let him off n sped away in her car...<br><br>i feel tat the 2 men in the 1st incident deserved to be punished for wad they did...however, i feel tat chingmy was too wilful in handling the 2nd incident...she was obviously in the wrong for speeding but she got away wif it by threatening the police...moreover, she made him eat up the summon paper which was purely wilfulness on her part...</div>

              i remember a show i watched several yrs back...it was a show abt how a group of kids were picked n trained in martial arts to defeat the bad guy...in tat show there were 2 instructors, 1 male n 1 female...in remember in tat show, there were 2 punishment scenes...the 1st one was rather interesting...
              
              3 boys from the group were playing near the lake...there were watching praying mantis fighting each other n having alot of fun...they were making a lot of noise and toking loudly..in the midst of tis, the female instructor happened to walk pass...she approached them...
              
              instructor: wad r u boys doing?
              one of the boys: we r watching these praying mantis fighting...
              instructor: y r u doing tis nw? isnt it suppose to be ur reading time? (there was a pause, boys looked a little guilty)
              instructor(pointed to corner near the lake): go n knee-bend over there!!! i want u to repeat ur conversation juz nw 100 times!!!
              
              it was a rather funny sight! the 3 boys lined up in 1 row n knee-bend by the lake...then they began repeating their conversation over n over again...as for the instructor, she juz walked past them, warning them sternly nt to slack...

              i recall another show i watched years back...i had the chance to watch it more than once as it was screened a few times...tis show is abt a female who enrolled herself into the army n her life during army training...the commander in tis show was very strict n punishments were common...yet among all of them, one incident stood out involving tis female n 2 of her fellow soldiers...
              
              it was during lunch one day...the female lead sat down wif 2 of her buddies at the cookhouse for lunch...1st i must state tat at the early part of the show, the commander did give specific warnings not to tok during mealtimes...so after having taken their food, the 3 females sat down to eat...below was wad happened...
              
              female lead started eating...
              
              buddy A(gave some food to female lead): duo chi yi dian ah!(do eat more)
              female lead: wo bu yao! wo yao jian fei! (i dun want! i want to slim down!)
              buddy B(looks over): ni zhe yang hai jian fei ah? ( u like tat still want to slim down?)
              buddy A: dui ah! ( ya lor!)
              
              unfortunately, the commander heard them toking...
              commander: shuo hua de gei wo zhan chu lai!!! (those who tok, stand up!!)
              
              minutes later, the 3 female soldiers were seen standing in 1 row in the fields...they carried an empty tray each...
              
              buddy A(pretend to give some food to female lead): duo chi yi dian ah!(do eat more)
              female lead: wo bu yao! wo yao jian fei! (i dun want! i want to slim down!)
              buddy B(looks over): ni zhe yang hai jian fei ah? ( u like tat still want to slim down?)
              buddy A: dui ah! ( ya lor!) 
              
              the above was repeated 3 times...
              commander: da sheng yi dian!!! (louder!!!)
              the 3 female soldiers spoke louder...
              
              buddy A(pretend to give some food to female lead): duo chi yi dian ah!(do eat more)
              female lead: wo bu yao! wo yao jian fei! (i dun want! i want to slim down!)
              buddy B(looks over): ni zhe yang hai jian fei ah? ( u like tat still want to slim down?)
              buddy A: dui ah! ( ya lor!) 
              commander: zai da sheng yi dian!!! (louder!!!)
              
              the female soldiers obliged, this time they were close to shouting..
              
              buddy A(pretend to give some food to female lead): DUO CHI YI DIAN AH!(do eat more)
              female lead: WO BU YAO! WO YAO JIAN FEI! (i dun want! i want to slim down!)
              buddy B(looks over): NI ZHE YANG HAI JIAN FEI AH? ( u like tat still want to slim down?)
              buddy A: DUI AH! ( ya lor!)
              
              in the end, as punishment for toking during mealtimes, the 3 female soldiers were made to repeat their conversation again n again for the rest of the mealtime. moreover, they had to speak up loudly thru out the punishment..as i watched this scene, i tot to myself: man, i cun imagine tis happening to me in real life...i can imagine how tirng it would have been for the 3 soldiers..they had to go without lunch n had to strain their vocals for close to 30min...i personally feel the punishment was very harsh though one may argue tat tis is military discipline, which has always been known to be harsh...

              <p>wif reference to the above, i recall watching the commander walking back to the cookhouse after punishing the 3 female soldiers...below was wad happened next..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>commander walked back top cookhouse, she looked at all the soldiers sternly...</p>
              <p>commander(pointed to the 3 soldiers): shuo hua de jiu hui gen ta men yi yang, zhi dao bu zhi dao!!!(those who tok will end up like them, understand???)</p>
              <p>the rest of the soldiers: shi zhang guan!!!(yes mdm!!!)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the show proceeded on. the next few seconds showed the commander eating her lunch...from the background, the voices of the 3 soldiers being punished could be heard...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>buddy A(pretend to give some food to female lead): <span>DUO CHI YI DIAN AH</span>!(do eat more)<br>female lead: <span>WO BU YAO</span>! WO <span>YAO JIAN FEI</span>!

              <p> </p>
              <p>in the next scene, the commander was seen blowing a whistle, signalling to the soldiers to fall in...after she had blown her whistle, she walked over to the field where the 3 soldiers were..they were seemingly tired out...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>buddy A(pretend to give some food to female lead): <span>DUO..CHI..YI..DIAN..AH</span>!(do eat more)<br>female lead: <span>WO..BU..YAO</span>! WO..<span>YAO..JIAN..FEI</span>!

              <p> </p>
              <p>commander: ni men hua shuo gou le mei you??(u had enuff of toking??) ni men hai xiang bu xiang ji xu shuo xia qu???(do u wish to continue toking??)</p>
              <p>the 3 tired soldiers(shook their heads): bu yao zhang guan!!!(no mdm!!!)</p>
              <p>commander: qu gen qi ta ren ji he!!!(go fall in wif the rest!!!) bu yao rang wo kan dao you xia yi ci!!!(i dun want tis to repeat again!!!) xia ci, wo jiu yao ni men bu ting de shuo dao ge tian zhao shang!!!(next time, i wil make u do tis until the next morning!!!)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the scene ended wif the 3 soldiers falling in wif the rest...from the above scenes, i can imagine how it would have felt if it happened in real life...the 3 soldiers throats would feel very dry n tired from the continuous recitation...also they had to stand under the hot sun in their uniforms...it was indeed a very harsh punishment n a stern warning to the rest of the soldiers... </p>

              <p>the punishment cited above is the 4th case of punishment involving recitation i have encountered...in my earlier posts i cited 3 other cases. the 1st involved my frend in pri 1 who was punished for interrupting the teacher n had to spend abt half hr reciting: i muz raise my hands b4 i speak at the back of the classroom..the 2nd case was seen in the local show, home run, where megan zhang was punished for lying to the teacher. she had to pull her ears n do half-squats n recite: i muz nt tell lies again..the 3rd case involved the 3 boys who were punished for playing during reading time. their female trainer made them knee-bend by the lake n recite their conversation 100 times...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>comparing the 4 cases, i muz say tat all of them were rather harsh in their own ways...for my frend's case, he sort of had the luxury to slack as the teacher wasnt looking at him half the time but he didnt slack at all(he recited without stopping for the whole duration)...moreover, the teacher did nt insist his recitations to be loud n clear...however, it was evident tat my frend was tired out from the punishment when it ended...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>for megan zhang, it was almost impossible to slack at all as her punishment involved having to do half-squats n she was within sight of the teacher. moreover, according to the show, after she had recited abt 70 times, the teacher called out to her from behind to recite louder...although the show didnt make clear how long she was punished, a smart guess would suggest tat she probably had to recite few hundred times b4 she was let off...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the 3rd case involving the 3 boys was harsh in 2 ways...1stly, they were made to knee-bend by the lake...it is nt known how long they were made to do tat...moreover, the female trainer ordered their recitations to be loud n clear...perhaps the onli saving grace for them was tat they onli had to recite 100times n nt for an unknown number of times like in all the other 3 cases...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the last case from above appears to be the harshest of all...the 3 female soldiers were made to stand at attention thru out n had to recite loudly every time. plus the commander kept them at it for close to half hr...moreover, they were in their uniforms n stood under the hot sun...in fact their recitations were close to shouting, louder than the boys in the 3rd case...the saving grace for them was tat they had very short breaks within each recitation(same as 3rd case)...they would shout out their lines, wait for the other 2 to finish theirs b4 shouting out their same lines again...this was unlike the 1st 2 cases where both my frend n megan zhang had to keep on reciting without any break...</p>

              <p>the next incidents i am abt to cite could be familiar to some of u...there ws tis show a few yrs back entitled happy flying dragon(huan xi you long)...attractive china-born actress zhang ting acted in tis one...in tis serial, she acted as the wilful princess duoluo...princess duoluo was spoilt n being the youngest was greatly pampered by her family..she was the youngest of 7 princesses n often went abt the palace seeking to kill boredom...unfortunately, the eunuchs, being lower ranked than her, often became her victims to kill her boredom...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>in episode 2, i recall princess duoluo taking a walk ard the palace...then she saw the leading actor(who disguised himself as a eunuch)...he had in episode 1 provoked her n princess duoluo vowed to get even wif him...so when she ran into him, she ordered him to be captured, awaiting punishment...after having some fun punishing him, she stil felt bored n wanted a grand finale...so she ordered the eunuchs ard her to tink of sth fun n punishing she could use to deal wif him...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the next scene was rather interesting...the main actor was seen being tied up upside down near a tree...there was a eunuch who pulled at a rope, causing the main actor to bang against the tree each time the rope was pulled...however, wad caught my eye was sth else...there were 3 junior eunuchs who were kneeling at a corner in 1 row, slapping themselves...initially i didnt noe y they were being punished...later on then i realised tat they were being punished for being stupid...earlier princess duoluo had ordered the eunuchs to tink of a way to punish the main actor...apparently, these 3 eunuchs when approached by princess duoluo could nt come up wif any ideas...wilful as she always was, princess duoluo(who always despised eunuchs) scolded them for being stupid...after the 4th eunuch managed to come up wif a gd idea, princess duoluo then ordered the 3 stupid eunuchs to kneel at a corner n slap themselves hard until she was satisfied...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>in the end, it needed the eldest princess' intervention to stop princess duoluo from behaving wilfully...she used the greater authority she had to force princess duoluo to release the eunuchs from their agony...in fact, princess duoluo may nt have released the eunuchs so soon if the eldest princess had nt intervened...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>in a much later episode though, the eldest princess herself was seen punishing a female servant...will post tis next...meantime, keep ur posts coming...</p>
