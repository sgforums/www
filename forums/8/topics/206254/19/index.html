              the principal of my cousin's former school was also known for her sarcasm..her scoldings often included some sarcastic remarks which though were not usually demeaning but were still malicious. tis was especially so when she meted out punishments to students.
              
              in my cousin's case mentioned previously, the principal sarcastically remarked tat it was pointless tat he n his classmate simplt stood outside her office. hence, she made them stand in a knee-bent position wif both hands raised in front of them for the entire recess..as my cousin mentioned, they cheated on the punishment by standing up once in a while to ease the tiredness in their legs. they were caught doing tat once by the principal. he recounted tat the principal walked from behind to the front n sarcastically asked them:"y r the 2 of u so tall?? is tis how u r suppose to stand?" wif tat , my cousin n his classmate resumed their knee-bent position. the principal continued:"dun let me see u so tall!! dun let me see u too short either by squatting down!!! stay in tis position, u hear me? if i catch u not in proper position, u will get it from me!!"
              
              due to tis, my cousin n his classmate had no choice but to remain in knee-bent position until the principal released them. they did shift their positions abit here n there but they kept their knees bent thru out. it was a very tiring experience for them n my cousin still remembers it until today...

              according to my cousin, students who were caught/handed over to the principal nvr got away lightly. they would end up being punished, usually outside her office...there were times when students were made to pick litter during recess for a whole wk..the DMs of the school was in cahoots wif the principal. students caught by them would be handed over to the principal n punishment would await them.
              
              the principal was known to punish students harsher than the teachers of tat school. she nvr gave light punishments as she was one who believed tat punishment had to be harsh in order for the students to learn from their mistakes. her punishments usually took out alot from the students. in fact, my cousin n his frend were not the onli ones who were made to knee-bend outside her office. there were other similar cases too.
              
              an observation my cousin made was tat the principal liked to punish students at 3 periods of the day. the 1st is right after morning assembly, 2nd is during recess or 3rd is after school. for shorter durations like recess time, she would mete out punishments tat were more demanding. students who were punished for shorter durations faced punishments like these: 1) kneel outside her office for entire duration(may have to pull ears), 2) stand in a knee-bend position wif both hands stretched out like my cousin's case, 3) stand outside her office n hold up their bags above their heads. although recess was onli abt 25min, students who experienced any of the above often felt tired after everything.
              
              punishments of longer durations usually took place after school or right after morning assembly. the punishments were less demanding in nature but by no means less harsh. students would be made to stand outside her office or at some common place in school(where everyone can see). such punishments usually lasted more than an hr. there were some cases when students had to stand facing the wall for more than an hr...my cousin witnessed a few cases when students were made to stand facing the wall outside principal's office for half a morning, after morning assembly until end of recess. 
              
              nobody liked the principal back then. my cousin shared tat they always called her names outside of school n many malicious things were spoken abt her...although her intentions were gd, we agree tat some of her punishments were too harsh. from wad he heard, the principal is not at tat school anymore...wonder where she is nw...

              "the teacher went back to her seat n sat down, looking very cross. she looked at the 2 boys who had been standing all tis while n ordered them to come forward. she then made each of them stand at either side of her table n face the blackboard. then as punishment for not speaking up when required, she made them repeat: â€œi must speak up in class!â€� loud enuff for her to hear. she left them instructions to keep repeating the phrase until she was satisfied."
              
              the punishment tat took place above was a rather unusual one. my form teacher nvr punished any of us in tat kind of manner b4. if it had happened on any other day, the students would probably be let off wif a scolding or at most made to stand for a while...
              
              i believe my form teacher did wad she did in a moment of anger. she was very angry wif the class at tat time n to make things worse, the 2 boys refused to speak up clearly when asked a qn...the teacher probably wanted to issue a stern warning to the rest of us tat if we dun speak up in future, we will end up like tat...
              
              i remember tat after the punishment was meted out, the teacher juz sat at her table, looking cross. i glanced at her a few times after tat n i noticed she wasnt realli doing anything. she juz sat there n flipped thru some bks but it was quite obvious she wasnt concentrating. thru out the time, the 2 boys could be heard doing the recitation next to her table. their agony only stopped when the teacher stood up, getting ready to walk out of the class..she told them to go back to their seats b4 saying tat she wasnt going to care for us anymore n walked out of the classroom...
              
              in my next post, i will make comparisons btw some of the teachers i have encountered n the way they treat students generally...

              students r usually not allowed to be walking ard during lesson time unless they have permission to do so from the teacher. then again, u must understand tat when students r punished along the corridor, the purpose is to make them learn their mistakes by making them feel ashamed n embarrassed.
              
              it is possible tat students of lower form may walk past n see the students being punished. all i can say is if u r so fearful of them seeing u being punished like tat, then u shld make it a pt nt to commit any mistakes tat will warrant such punishments...if u feel tat the punishment was unfair, then u shld complain to higher authorities...

              the reason y my pri 3 form teacher was well-liked was cos she nvr gave up on any of us, even the naughty students...she was someone who would take the trouble to give weaker students personal guidance n would give extra lessons whenever exams were near...there were a few naughty n playful students in my class tat yr. yet under her guidance n disciplining, they became much better. although she had to punish them on a number of occasions, our teacher nvr gave up on them n always punished in love...
              
              i still remember how we rejoiced the following yr when she walked into class on the 1st day of school...the class on the whole actually hoped tat she would still be our form teacher in pri 4 but nobody including herself knew if tat will happen...so when she walked into class tat day, the whole class cheered...we were very happy tat she was going to be our form teacher for another yr..even the naughty students who had been punished by her on numerous occasions cheered...
              
              after we have quieten down, she began to address the class. i can still remember wad she told us...she told us tat since we have gotten wad we wanted, she expected us to be gd students n behave ourselves tat yr...she hoped tat we will work hard n tat she wouldnt have to discipline us..she even playfully threatened tat if we misbehave or become naughty, she will stop caring for us n request to change a new class..."so can u promise me tat u will be gd students tis yr? can we look forward to an enjoyable yr tgr?"..."yes, teacher!!!" man, i realli miss those 2 yrs!!! she is one of the best teachers we ever had...

              i can stil remember how my form teacher above took measures to keep the class quiet on at least 2 occasions...in the 2 yrs she had as our form teacher, there were few occasions when she had to punish the class corporately for making too much noise...the punishment was rather interesting although we hated it each time...
              
              it was sth like tis...our teacher didnt like us to tok when she was teaching n she doesnt like to come to class, seeing the students making alot of noise...she often taught us to sit quietly in our seats waiting for our teachers to come in...the onli times she allowed us to tok in class was when she had stopped teaching n given us work to do...we were allowed to tok to our neighbours n discuss our work although the noise level had to be kept low...
              
              she wasnt someone who would punish us without giving warning 1st...i rem one particular case when she left the class to get sth n the class started getting noisy...minutes later, she returned n stood at the doorway, glaring at the class angrily. the class quietened down immediately. i stil remember tat she walked to her table, glared at the class n scolded us for making so much noise. in the end, the whole class was punished. she made each of us put our finger on our lips, instructing us to keep it there until she said otherwise...
              
              the lesson proceeded after tat...i still remember how each of us sat in our seats, listening to her teaching wif our finger on our lips...many of us felt it was rather fun to do tis at 1st...however, as the lesson proceeded, we began to change our minds...our arms started to feel tired, having to keep it at the same position thru out...yet nobody was allowed to put his/her finger down...the teacher even scolded a few students for putting their fingers down...
              
              it was abt 15min later tat we were released from our agony...our teacher asked if we enjoyed putting our fingers on our lips...needless to say, our answer was a no...b4 releasing us, she made us promise not to make so much noise in future...i still remember tat she spent a few minutes after class explaining to us y we were punished n said tat if we find it tiring n embarrassing putting our fingers on our lips, we shld learn nt to make so much noise when theres no teacher in class...b4 she left the class, she warned tat if we do tis again in future, she will punish us the same way...well, it did deter us as the noise level in class was kept low after tat although we were punished the same way on 1 or 2 more occasions. at the end of the day, nobody complained tat she treated us unfairly as we knew it was all for our own gd...

                              <p>i can stil remember how my form teacher above took measures to
              keep the class quiet on at least 2 occasionsâ€¦in the 2 yrs she had
              as our form teacher, there were few occasions when she had to
              punish the class corporately for making too much noiseâ€¦the
              punishment was rather interesting although we hated it each
              timeâ€¦</p>
              <p>it was sth like tisâ€¦our teacher didnt like us to tok when she
              was teaching n she doesnt like to come to class, seeing the
              students making alot of noiseâ€¦she often taught us to sit quietly in
              our seats waiting for our teachers to come inâ€¦the onli times she
              allowed us to tok in class was when she had stopped teaching n
              given us work to doâ€¦we were allowed to tok to our neighbours n
              discuss our work although the noise level had to be kept lowâ€¦</p>
              <p>she wasnt someone who would punish us without giving warning
              1stâ€¦i rem one particular case when she left the class to get sth n
              the class started getting noisyâ€¦minutes later, she returned n stood
              at the doorway, glaring at the class angrily. the class quietened
              down immediately. i stil remember tat she walked to her table,
              glared at the class n scolded us for making so much noise. in the
              end, the whole class was punished. she made each of us put our
              finger on our lips, instructing us to keep it there until she said
              otherwiseâ€¦</p>
              <p>the lesson proceeded after tatâ€¦i still remember how each of us
              sat in our seats, listening to her teaching wif our finger on our
              lipsâ€¦many of us felt it was rather fun to do tis at 1stâ€¦however, as
              the lesson proceeded, we began to change our mindsâ€¦our arms started
              to feel tired, having to keep it at the same position thru outâ€¦yet
              nobody was allowed to put his/her finger downâ€¦the teacher even
              scolded a few students for putting their fingers downâ€¦</p>
              <p>it was abt 15min later tat we were released from our agonyâ€¦our
              teacher asked if we enjoyed putting our fingers on our
              lipsâ€¦needless to say, our answer was a noâ€¦b4 releasing us, she made
              us promise not to make so much noise in futureâ€¦i still remember tat
              she spent a few minutes after class explaining to us y we were
              punished n said tat if we find it tiring n embarrassing putting our
              fingers on our lips, we shld learn nt to make so much noise when
              theres no teacher in classâ€¦b4 she left the class, she warned tat if
              we do tis again in future, she will punish us the same wayâ€¦well, it
              did deter us as the noise level in class was kept low after tat
              although we were punished the same way on 1 or 2 more occasions. at
              the end of the day, nobody complained tat she treated us unfairly
              as we knew it was all for our own gdâ€¦</p>

              ok so nw as promised in an earlier post, i will make comparisons btw some of the teachers who taught me during my younger days in sch...to start the ball rolling, i will compare the most feared teacher wif the most well-liked teacher..both of then taught me in pri sch...
              
              the most well-liked teacher of cuz is my form teacher in pri 3 n 4 while the most feared teacher was my chinese teacher in pri 1...both of them were strict but they had diff approaches to guiding n disciplining students...my form teacher was one who believed in loving n caring approach...although she still resorted to punishments nw n then, it was obvious she punished out of love n care...she onli punished when there was a need to n hardly punished us very harshly...often she would explain to us y she punished us which did help us to understand n learn from our mistakes.
              
              as for my chinese teacher in pri 1, she was one who believed tat students must be taught thru punishments...hence, punishments were very common in her lessons...she was very strict wif almost everything n u could find students being punished in almost all her lessons...moreover, she was unlike my form teacher above. she would mete out harsh punishments at times so as to teach the students a lesson..tis teacher is the one i mentioned earlier who meted out a rather harsh punishment to 1 of my classmates...she made him do continuous recitation at the back of the classroom for more than half an hr juz cos he had a habit of interrupting her without raising his hand...
              
              i can still remember the kind of fear we had for her...we would be punished for the slightest offences like answering a qn wrongly(or dunno answer), whispering to our neighbours during class or nt paying attention in class...there were numerous occasions when students were made to stand for the rest of the lesson cos they committed one of the offences above...imagine making a pri 1 kid stand for the entire lesson juz cos he/she couldnt answer a qn correctly! my form teacher above would nvr do tat...she nvr punished anyone for failing to answer a qn correctly...
              
              one incident tat happened in tat chinese teacher's class remains vivid in my mind...i remember she was teaching on the board...at tat time, there were 2 boys would were standing...they were being punished for toking to each other earlier...wad happened was the teacher caught them whispering to each other n giggling softly despite being punished...the teacher lost her temper n ordered them to the front. she scolded them harshly for being rebellious, toking n giggling away when being punished...she ordered each of them to slap themselves on their cheeks 10 times in front of the whole class! then instead of letting them off, she ordered each of them to kneel on the 2 sides of her table n pull their ears!! mind u, we were onli in pri 1! yet she punished them so severely...the boys were made to kneel until she finished teaching(remaining time was for us to do some work) n by then, u could see tat they were close to tears from kneeling...
              
              the main difference btw these 2 teachers was tat our chinese teacher hardly let anyone off for committing mistakes whereas my form teacher would at times...moreover, our chinese teacher nvr once explained y we were punished...she would simply make us do punishments n release us without teaching us y we were punished...from my observation, it seems to me tat our chinese teacher(who was in her forties) belonged to the older generation of teachers who believed tat punishments(harsh ones too) was the best form of guiding students..my form teacher, on the other hand, was in her early thirties n belonged to the newer generation tat believed in treating students wif love n care n tat punishments, if given shld be done out of love. students shld be taught y they were punished so tat they will understand tat the teacher meant well...such contrasting styles of teaching n guiding yet i believed both teachers meant well at the end of the day...

              personally i feel tat one problem teachers in general may have is their temperament. while it is impt tat teachers learn how to control their emotions in class, it is a fact tat they r still humans after all. my form teacher in pri3 n 4 is an example of a teacher who could manage her emotions rather well. true, tehre were times when she got very angry n scolded us harshly...yet she didnt let her emotions get the better of her...she would nt punish us the errant student so harshly until he/she cried or vent her anger on the rest of us...
              
              2 teachers i remember who were rather temperamantal include my chinese teacher in pri 1 n my art teacher in sec 2. my very 1st post was wad happened in one of her art classes in sec 2. as i mentioned b4, she was very sensitive abt vulgarities n apparently, the vulgarity she heard got her nerves...tis explains y she reacted so strongly...it seems rather obvious tat her anger got the better of her which explain y the punishment she meted out was so harsh. i find her someone who could nt control her anger well as she would often scream at the top of her voice when she got angry...although her anger did not always lead to very harsh punishments, her temperament was obvious for all to see...
