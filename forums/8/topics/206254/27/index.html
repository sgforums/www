              basically punishments come in 2 basic categories...
              
              1) the type tat uses pain, tiredness to deter the offence from being repeated...eg. student caught using vulgarities...
              Punishment is to slap himself for the entire period.
              
              2) the "more than enuff" type where student is caught doing a particular action tat is considered an offence...eg. student kept making faces at his classmates despite being given warnings...
              Punishment is to make faces without stopping for an entire period...

              <p>i recall a case tat happened when i was in pri 5. it was during a prize presentation and we were rehearsing for the actual event. i remember when we entered the school hall on tat day, we saw 2 pri 4 boys standing below the stage, in front of the hall and pulling their ears. apparently, they were being punished by the teacher-in-charge for misbehaving in class. the 2 of them stood next to each other as the rehearsal proceeded wif the teacher-in-charge overseeing the proceedings...</p>
              <p>after our 1st round of rehearsal, the teacher-in-charge came over to brief us on the various aspects tat could be improved and to get ready for the 2nd round of rehearsal. whilst doing tat, she happened to look at the 2 boys' direction n saw them toking to each other. furious, she excused herself from us n stormed towards the 2 boys. i remember seeing her smacking them on their arms n after some scolding, she made them stand separately at the 2 corners below the stage. she ended off by ordering: "Slap urselves, the 2 of u!!!" she then returned to where we were, leaving the 2 boys in agony...</p>
              <p>i recall tat the 2 boys were punished until the halfway pt of the rehearsal where we were allowed to take a break. by then, abt an hr had passed. thru out tis time, the teacher-in-charge would glance at the 2 boys occasionally to ensure tat they kept up wif the slapping. i estimate the slapping lasted no less than half hr. the onli saving grace for the 2 boys was tat the teacher didnt insist their slaps to be hard n painful. most of the time, their "slapping" was onli slightly more than patting...it seems tat the teacher wasnt too particular abt the hardness of the slaps. she was satisfied as long as they kept up wif the "slapping" action. still, i feel tat the punishment given was rather harsh although it was justifiable given tat the 2 boys deserved to be punished cos they were unrepentant, toking despite being punished...</p>

              Is the teacher-in-charge of ur prize presentation ceremony the same teacher that punished them initially? If not, she could have informed the teacher who punished them about it rather than giving them more punishments. I guess younger teachers nowadays will just ignore those who are not punished by them.

              Oh so u mean the teacher brought the 2 boys along to the hall with her? Hm... she could have made them stand outside the staff room instead? There will definitely be more people looking at them outside staff room than the hall right?

              That happens many years ago. Nowadays, teachers are so young and easy-going. They probably make students stand at one corner of classroom at most. I think most of my female friends who are teachers are like that. I can't imagine they give harsh punishments.

            <div class='col-md body'>Last time in my sec sch, there used to be a garden in the middle of the building where the first level consists of staff room and general office while the the other levels are all classrooms. In the middle of the garden, there is a palm tree surrounded by pebbles and very often, students are punished to stand on the pebbles under the palm tree so that people who pass by as well as from the above classrooms corridor can see. It's like being in the centre of attraction. Haha...</div>
