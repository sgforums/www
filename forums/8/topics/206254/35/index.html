                              <p>Chasing the student out of the class is the most ineffective
              punishment. It isn't even a punishment at all actually - the
              student gets the privilege of having his own private space along
              the corridor, and he doesn't have to even pretend that he is
              listening to whatever the teacher is saying.</p>
              <p>Worst of all is when a student gets sent out of the class for
              forgetting his/her materials/text/whatever. It merely serves to
              deny the student the right to learn. But this applies to all
              punishments that seeks to cause physical strain which causes them
              to lose their mental concentration.</p>

              She sent them out of the classroom because they irritated her and the rest of the class so much that she doesn't want to see them.

              She studied computing in uni and after graduation, she worked for about 2 or 3 years and finally decided to go back to teaching again. She studied 2 years in NIE to get a Diploma in Edu and is now teaching in a neighbourhood pri sch. According to her, she enjoyed teaching in pri sch as the kids are so much adorable and easier to handle compared to sec sch kids. Her worst punishment is to make a boy stand outside classroom for 15 mins and it happened once only so far.

              Hm... she probbaly followed what other teachers did to make them stand on chair outside classroom. I don't think it was her idea then. But then she said that they can't keep still on the chair and kept stepping down until she had to draw circle on the floor. Haha... quite funny idea.

I guess the boys punished by her must have felt humilated because of the childish punishment and she was only 5 years older than them. I can't imagine a young female teacher ask me stand on chair too so I teased her about it :=)

              <p>actually standing on chair is not unheard of lah...but it can be dangerous cos the student can lose balance and fall off if the chair is unstable...maybe tis is one thing ur frend shld take note of if she ever decides to do this to any of her students though i dun tink tis is allowed anymore in recent yrs...</p>
              <p>anyway, there was a most embarrassing punishment tat took place when i was in primary one in tat chinese teacher's class. i still remember tat she was walking down the rows and reading from the textbook(sth she always did as she taught), explaining certain phrases along the way. then as she approached one of my classmate, she knocked hard on his table, causing him to jerk up suddenly. apparently, my classmate was resting his head on his palm and although his textbook was in front of him on the table, he was actually nodding away...needless to say, our teacher was furious at him for sleeping during her lesson...she ordered him to stand up b4 proceeding to reprimand him for sleeping in class...</p>
              <p>the scolding lasted for a few mins...after tat, the teacher said sarcastically to the student tat she will help him to keep awake...hence, she ordered him to remain standing where he was. then to ensure he wun nod off while standing, she ordered him to slap himself to keep awake...</p>
              <p>i can still remember tat the teacher made the student slap himself until she had finished teaching...she went up to him after giving us work to do and asked if he was awake...the student nodded and she released him, warning tat if she caught him sleeping again in future, she will make him stand and slap himself for every lesson for a whole week. personally, i felt tat the student deserved to be punished for sleeping but given tat we were in primary one tat yr, perhaps the punishment was a little too harsh...she could have juz made him stand for the entire lesson without the slapping... </p>

              Yeah you're right. Another of my female friend who is not a teacher suggested making the student stand on one leg for 30 mins. I asked her how she can expect the student to maintain balance for so long and she said she will ask the student to spread out his arms. Then I asked her if she would allow the student to change leg halfway and she said no. Haha... seems like females can think of many creative punishments!

              Male teachers usually spank students while female teachers will think of creative punishments which are usually tiring right? Hm... perhaps one or two spanks is better than long duration sufferings like standing tiptoes. Haha.... female teachers are more fierce in the sense that their punishments are of long durations. Like what movies always say, females can be nice and caring but if you offend them, they will make you suffer deeply!

              Since you mentioned that teachers were so strict during our time in the early 80s, can I say that people around our age would have been punished in pri or sec sch at least once? Maybe the minimum will be standing at a corner of the classroom for talking or perhaps the whole class was punished for some mistake. Punishments were unavoidable during that time then?

              Yeah haha ... cos they were punished to pull ears and stand long hours often in school.
              
              I heard from one of my friend who studied in a convent pri &amp; sec school that her teachers like to punish the whole class to stand on table. She said it was common in her school. Haha... I thought standing on chair or table applies to boys only.

              Oh I see. No wonder in smart_boy_only's posts, his English is quite different from us. Hm... it seems that in China, their favourite punishment is stand and pull ears. Haha... sometimes we see in Chinese movies that those fierce tai tais made their husbands kneel down and pull ears.

              Wow ... perhaps should just make them stand outside staff room and pull ears during recess. That will make them feel embarassed especially for a female sec 4 student and they will not dare to be late again right? How will you punish them instead if u're the principal?
