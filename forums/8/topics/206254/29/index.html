              <p>For extremely naughty kids, I will work together with the PE
              teacher (if I am not in charge of PE for that class) to make sure
              the child doesn't get to play in the games during the PE lesson.
              Either that or I will keep the child in class during recess,
              provided of course I have food to offer to him.</p>
              <p>Now we can only implement punishment in the form of withdrawing
              things that the child enjoys, ie PE lesson etc.</p>

              Yeah it does work but there is a possibility of the kid taking advantage of the teacher's kindness. In this case, I don't mind to be punished everyday. Haha...

              Oh will that happen? Last time you did mention before that the students who are punished are automatically released when the school bell rings? Hehe... maybe in the case where the teacher asked the students to stand outside staff room after school, she may forgot about them and furthermore there are no more school bells.

                              <p>i believe there r such cases though rare...usually such cases

              sight. the teacher may get too engrosses teaching n marking stuff
              tat he/she forgets all abt the student. for eg, teacher is in class

              Oh yeah, this case is quite common too. "Stand outside classroom" punishment. Haha... wouldn't the student run away without the teacher reliasing?

              Oh I see. A lot of punishments are not allowed nowadays even those that don't hurt the child physically or emotionally.

              Well, I think they do have a standard guidelines to say which punishments are not allowed but it still very much depends on the school. I ever came across blogs of sec sch students who said they were punished to stand on chair or outside classroom so I guess there are some teachers especially the more senior ones who ignored the guidelines and continue to give such punishments which will not hurt the student physically, mentally or emotionally. Take the case of standing outside classroom, it will at most make the student's leg tired. If this basic form of punishment is not allowed, it is as good as saying teachers cannot punish student.

              <p>I agree that punishment have to vary according to age of students as well as the severity of the offence. There is no ultimate punishment to fit all students of all ages and offences. So punishment is ultimately up to the teacher.</p>
              <p>I suggest that as a teacher, you should do this after punishing the student:</p>
              <p>1. Find a quiet spot and look at the situation from an objective angle. Replay the scene again, but this time imagine yourself being a student.</p>
              <p>2. Ask yourself if the punishment is too severe (did you let your emotions control you?)</p>
              <p>3. Ask yourself if the punishment is able to deter the student from making the same mistake (if it does not, then the punishment has lost its purpose)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ultimately, I feel that every student does things for a reason, whether its right or wrong, and as a teacher, it is up to us to find out this reason from the student and address it, so the student can understand and learn.</p>
              <p>As students, how many of us prefer a teacher who punishes us harshly after an offence over a teacher who has a strong rapport with us and takes the trouble to find out our trouble and addresses it?</p>
