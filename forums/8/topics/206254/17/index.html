            <div class='col-md body'><p>a little off topic but does anyone find that if a teacher threatens punishment for something(say haircut, homework ect) but you hella dont give a crapstick and argue back with some logic, not lies... literally trauting them by questioning the rules, the teachers actually treats you way better and maybe almost as an equal after that? pretty amazing but every teacher i stood down i could later joke and talk with and they'd make exceptions in the rules really try it its pretty cool shit..</p></div>

              realli??? i cun say the same for my time...maybe nowadays discipline in sch has slacken...but i feel tat some students nowadays r wad they r cos schools have slacken in enforcing rules...councilling may be gd but it may nt work for every student...
              
              
              btw, if anyone here can share experiences wif punishments in school, do help to bring the thread back to topic...

              a cousin of mine recently shared an experience he had when he was in sec 1...he recalled tat there was an incident when he n one of his classmates were punished by the principal for playing a fool in class...
              
              wad happened was tis: it was in btw lessons, they were waiting for the next teacher to come into class...during tis time, my cousin n his frend were away from their seats...they were toking away while sitting on the teacher's table...they began playing tic tac toe on the blackboard n were making lots of noises despite warnings from the class monitor...just then, the principal happened to walk past. she heard the noises n gestured for the 2 of them to come out to meet her...in the end, she scolded them for making so much noise n ordered them to see her at her office during recess..
              
              when recess time arrived, the 2 of them reported at the principal's office...at tat time, she was busy doing sth impt n so she ordered them to stand outside her office n wait for her...several minutes later, the principal came out. she spoke to them sternly n ordered them to stand further apart. then she remarked: i tink it wun help much for u to juz stand here...after a slight pause, she ordered them to stretch out both their hands straight in front of them. next she made them stand wif their knees bent...b4 returning to her office, she instructed them to stay in tat position until she said so...
              
              as my cousin recalled, he n his classmate did nt remain in tat position for the entire duration...they cheated on the punishment at times...according to my cousin, they couldnt help but cheat as it was realli tiring knee-bending in tat manner...hence, they cheated now n then by standing up instead of knee-bending..they actually got caught cheating once by the principal n were warned tat if they got caught again, they wil be in greater trouble...when tat happened, my cousin n his frend tried hard nt to cheat although it was realli difficult as the punishment was realli tiring...
              
              in the end, the 2 of them were punished for the entire recess...the principal onli released them after the bell rang for classes to resume...by then, their hands had alredi began to droop n their legs were tiredly wobbly...my cousin recalled how his legs were hurting at the end of it...it was the worst punishment he evr received in his sch life n he wun ever forget how he had to stand wif bent knees for abt 20min without resting...

              but i can understand how my cousin n his frend must have felt back then...although i have nvr been punished in tat same manner, its nt difficult to noe tat its very tiring standing wif bent knees for periods of at least 15min...in fact my cousin recalled tat the principal was known to be rather strict n during his 4 yrs in tat sch, he witnessed several occasions when students were punished by tat principal...
              
              students were usually punished outside the principal's office...the principal would mete out different kinds of punishments according to the offences committed...there was a case involving a boy n a gal during one morning assembly...my cousin recalled tat the 2 students were caught dozing off in the midst of morning assembly b the principal...furious, she told the prefect to record their names n give the names to her...
              
              at recess time tat day, my cousin was on his way to the canteen when he saw the 2 students along wif the principal outside her office...wad happened was: as punishment for dozing off during assembly, the gal was ordered to stand at a corner, pull her ears n do half-squats continuously...it was worse for the boy...the principal marched him to a corner outside her office, pull his ears n do frog jumps towards the other corner outside her office...when the boy reached the other corner, he had to turn ard n continue frog jumping back...he was ordered to frog jump to n fro without stopping until the principal was satisfied...
              
              my cousin recalled tat the 2 students had a horrid time...after he had finished his meal, my cousin walked to the toilet...on his way there, he had to pass by the principal's office where he saw the 2 students stil doing punishment...from their actions, it was obvious they were tired out...the gal was half-squatting rather slowly n from her face, he could see tat every half-squat was hurting her legs...as for the boy, he could hardly lift up his legs when he jumped...each time he jumped, his legs were onli slightly off the ground...perhaps the onli saving grace for the 2 students was tat the principal did nt punish them for the entire recess...she released them 5mins b4 the end of recess...by then, they had been half-squatting n frog-jumping for abt 20min each...it was indeed a very horrid experience for both students n i feel tat the punishments meted out were rather harsh though nt inhumane...

              <p>my cousin recalled tat during his days in tat school...the worst punishment he knew of happened when he was in secondary 3...he remembered tat in tat yr there were 2 secondary 4 gals who were punished very harshly for coming to sch late...1st it must be noted tat they were nt late for the 1st time...in fact they had been booked b4 for lateness at least twice in the same semester...the school, like many others was rather strict wif lateness n students who came late to sch for 1st or 2nd time will have their names taken down n CWO wouldÂ await 2nd time offenders...</p>
              <p>on tat fateful day,Â the school was in the midst of morning assembly when a prefect walked up to the principal n inform her abt sth...after the announcements were read, the principal took over the microphone n spoke to the school sternly abtÂ punctuality...she then instructed theÂ prefect-in-charge of latenessÂ to summoned the 2 gals to where the flag poles stood...moments later, it was made known to the school tat those 2 gals had been booked for lateness forÂ the 4th time...as she addressed the school on punctuality, the 2 secondary 4 gals were made to stand next to a flag pole each...</p>
              <p>b4 concluding the assembly, the principal said tat the gals' parents would be summoned to school...she even said tat if they came late to sch again after tat, they would be suspended from school...b4 closing the assembly, the principal ordered tat the 2 gals would stand by the flagpoles as a punishment until their parents arrive...</p>
              <p>it was unimagineable!!! according to my cousin, those 2 secondary 4 gals were punished for more than 5 hrs!!! the principal kept gd her word n made them stand by the flagpoles for the whole morning!!! so as lessons were going on, the 2 gals were seen standing by the flagpoles...by the time, it was recess, it was obvious how tired the 2 gals were...in fact, his form teacher even told the class tat she saw one of the gals crying as she stood during recess...the onli saving grace for them was tat they stood in a sheltered area n so were safe from rain n sunshine...the principal onli released them for 5min during recess to go to the toilet after which, they resumed punishment for the rest of the morning.</p>
              <p>by the time the 2 gals were released, it was alredi end of sch tat day at ard 1pm...one of my cousin's classmate saw the 2 gals being spoken to by the principal outside her office. they were waiting for their parents to come. both of them were in tears, it was obvious y they were crying...their legs were hurting terribly...the principal made them stand for the entire morning to teach them a lesson...in the end, they n their parents were given a gd toking to by the principal n it was probably the worst day in school...</p>

              <p>quite inhumane and dumb if u ask me..</p>
              <p>the girls were made to stand for the whole day and they missed their lessons..</p>
              <p>u instil fear in people to make sure they abide by the rules.. is that not dictatorship?</p>
              <p>the students made a mistake yes.. the punishment made them whim and cry and taught them not to be late and naughty yes.. but im sure the students did not understand what they were punished for, as in, why talking so loudly and being late repeatedly was wrong.. punishment and humiliation without guidance is just wrong..</p>

              <p><br>1) i just dun condone punishments that do not allow the students to learn where they gone wrong.. punishments yes, but in the helpful/ let-them-learn way..</p>
              <p>2) as you said, they are repeated offenders.. and there are many reasons why this happens, they sleep late, they hate school, so on.. if the school views this seriously, the principal should summon the parents for a talk 1st.. find out what the hell is wrong at home, is there a problem with their slping hours, and so on.. let the family deal with the kids 1st.. family-school interaction is impt.. and do seek the parents' understanding that if after all the school's efforts to help the students failed, then they will have to implement detentions,resort to punishment and in the worst cases humiliation..Â  afterall, it is other people's children you are hurting, even if its for their interest.. however, even if detentions are used, teachers-in-charge can counsel them, and not let them waste their time in school just sitting there till 7pm and end up they cant finish their work(dun tell me u really do your hmwk when u tio detention, if u did, LOL @ you) when they get home..</p>
              <p>3) LLST.. stand lo.. but at the end of the day, i will learn that if i dun go to school early/on time, i will be humiliated.. i wun realise that being late will affect my studies and i wun noe that t i should sleep early so that i can be fresh for the next day's lessons..</p>
              <p>however, we must understand that whatever i have mentioned will work well only if all parties(teachers, principal, family) work hard to achieve it, and more imptly maintain the dedication to help and counsel the students for many many years.. once you have any of the parties slacking and not doing their part.. gg..</p>

              but seriously, i cun imagine myself standing by the flagpole doing nth for a whole morning...it will be soooooooo boring!!! psychologically torturing...dun u tink so, purpledragon??? but anyway u cun blame lah, the principal was known to be very strict. so u can expect punishments like these to come from her...the principal's rationale for the above case was tis: since they repeatedly came late for school then they dun deserve to attend lessons...since they missed a large part of morning assembly, then they shall stand by the flagpoles n have morning assembly all by themselves for the rest of the morning...
              
              from wad i noe, those 2 gals became famous overnite...actually my cousin didnt noe them at all initially...but after tat incident, he could recognise their faces each time he ran into them although tis was onli for a few mths as the 2 gals graduated in tat same yr...

              hey but imagine for a moment...wad if the principal had gone one step further n order the 2 gals to stand at attention for the whole morning??? tat would be far worse than normal standing which permits standing on one leg or standing wif legs slightly apart etc...
              
              for myself the longest i was ever punished was for a whole hr...i remember i was in secondary 3 then...it was during POA lesson...a fellow classmate n i didnt submit our hmwork n it wasnt our 1st time...i remember the teacher came into class n after greeting the class, called us out n walked us to the teacher's room...she then made us stand at 2 separate corners outside the teacher's room...b4 she left us, she instructed us sternly nt to leave our positions until she returned...
              
              in the end, we were made to stand outside the teacher's room for the entire 2 periods. i recall tat my legs were quite tired at the end of it...so cun imagine standing for a duration which is 5times longer like the case above...n they were gals u noe...
              
              hey purpledragon or anyone here, wad was ur longest punishment like???

              the teacher in my very 1st post of tis thread did sth exceptional in tat same yr to another of my classmate...1st i muz state tat her punishments were usually very predictable...usually she would make offenders stand outside the classroom or send them for detention if they were repeated offenders...the very 1st post of tis thread was one of two exceptional cases when she meted out an unusual punishment...
              
              the 2nd case happened in the art room...unlike the 1st case, tis wasnt abt vulgarities...instead tis was abt toking in class...the strange thing is tat tis teacher hardly punished us for toking in class...yet on tis occasion, a boy was punished for toking in class...i recall tat after she had gave us instructions abt the art work for tat wk, she told us to do our work quietly b4 sitting down at her table to mark some art pieces...
              
              moments later, the incident took place...1st i muz state tat the class was indeed very quiet n for myself, i didnt hear anyone toking at all...yet the teacher apparently heard sth...below was wad happened...
              
              teacher heard some noises n looked up,
              teacher: U, COME HERE!!! (student approached towards her table)
              teacher(points next to her table): STAND HERE...(paused)...N PULL UR EARS!!!
              
              it was an interesting sight...i remember looking up n saw my classmate pulling his ears, looking utterly embarrassed!! the teacher juz continued wif wad she was doing, leaving my classmate feeling ashamed n embarrassed...the teacher kept him there for abt 15min b4 releasing him...to me, tis was an unusual incident as the teacher would normally send the student out of class. however, tis was different. she made him stand in front of the class n pull his ears. i remember clearly tis was the onli case tat yr when she made someone pull his ears...i personally feel tat the teacher deliberately punished him in front of the class to warn the rest of us tat if we made any noises, we would end up like him. it was funny to watch but boy, was it embarrassing for my classmate!!!
