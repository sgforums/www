              <p><br> Hey, this seemed like a very common punishment too. One of my
              friend said that her sec sch chinese teacher punished them this way
              for not bringing textbook. They have to outstretch their hands for
              1 period. Hm...... stretch out hands horizontally or vertically
              more tiring?</p>

              wif regards to stretching out of hands horizontally n vertically, i dun tink we can realli say which is more tiring. diff sets of muscles r being strained here. for horizontal stretching, ur lower part of the hand wil hurt more whereas for vertical stretching, ur shoulder area will hurt more...one of the worst form of punishment i ever heard of is when the student is made to hold up his schbag above his head wif both hands straight up wif his legs in a half-bent position. although i have nvr exprienced it myself, it obvious tis form of punishment is utterly harsh n painful. 
              
              i remember watching an episode in a particular program where the host shared tat during her schooling days, her teacher did make students carry their bags above their heads n knee-bend at a corner of the classroom for the whole lesson. students usually couldnt keep it up for whole lesson and would end up in tears. the teacher would either allow them to go back to their seats or lighten their punishment by allowing them to put their hands down n to stand in the normal way for rest of lesson. such punishments r hardly seen in modern day singapore as teachers opt for a more caring n loving approach of teaching n guiding students...

Then you write in to MOE, they said teacher correct, student wrong. Then you go home and appeal thru your parents, parents said very good, teacher punish you, very good teacher, must thank you teacher for punishing my ever naughty, out of control daughter.</p>

              like i said, u cun realli compare which is more tiring cos diff sets of muscles r being exerted here...for a person who has stronger shoulder muscles, vertical stretching may be less tiring...for a person who has stronger muscles ard the albows n lower arm, horizontal stretching will be less tiring...
              
              yet having said all these, the punishment shared by the host of tat program mentioned above is one of the worst, if not the worst. its the type of punishment tat will almost certainly make students cry if done for a long period...

              Hm... maybe you're right in the sense that it depends on which muscle you use. I think this punishment is quite common especially in Korea. I wonder how they can take it. But then, is this punishment effective in making student follow rules?

              as expected, the principal looked furious when she saw wad happened...after greeting the class n telling them to do their own work quietly, she summoned the 2 students to the front. she scolded them for being disrespectful, toking n not standing up to greet even when she had come into the classroom. as she sat at the teacher's table, she told the 2 students tat they will not go unpunished for wad they did...
              
              in the end, the principal made them stand on either side of the teacher's table, facing her. then she ordered them to bow n greet her, repeating tis process until she was satisfied. she told the class tat tis was how students who didnt noe how to respect would be taught. they will practise showing respect until she was satisfied. my cousin shared tat the rest of the students were relieved they were not the ones being punished as the principal made those 2 students bow n greet her for almost the entire period!!! it was obvious from their body language tat they were tired out near the end of it...it was rather funny seeing them being punished in tat manner although my cousin shared tat nobody dared to laugh at them, fearing they may also get punished...it was indeed a harsh punishment n those 2 students did learnt from it...
