              <p>the teacher in my very 1st post of tis thread did sth exceptional in tat same yr to another of my classmate…1st i muz state tat her punishments were usually very predictable…usually she would make offenders stand outside the classroom or send them for detention if they were repeated offenders…the very 1st post of tis thread was one of two exceptional cases when she meted out an unusual punishment…</p>
              <p>the 2nd case happened in the art room…unlike the 1st case, tis wasnt abt vulgarities…instead tis was abt toking in class…the strange thing is tat tis teacher hardly punished us for toking in class…yet on tis occasion, a boy was punished for toking in class…i recall tat after she had gave us instructions abt the art work for tat wk, she told us to do our work quietly b4 sitting down at her table to mark some art pieces…</p>
              <p>moments later, the incident took place…1st i muz state tat the class was indeed very quiet n for myself, i didnt hear anyone toking at all…yet the teacher apparently heard sth…below was wad happened…</p>
              <p>teacher heard some noises n looked up,<br>teacher: U, <span>COME HERE</span>!!! (student approached towards her table)<br>teacher(points next to her table): <span>STAND HERE</span>…(paused)...N <span>PULL UR EARS</span>!!!</p>
              <p>it was an interesting sight…i remember looking up n saw my classmate pulling his ears, looking utterly embarrassed!! the teacher juz continued wif wad she was doing, leaving my classmate feeling ashamed n embarrassed…the teacher kept him there for abt 15min b4 releasing him…to me, tis was an unusual incident as the teacher would normally send the student out of class. however, tis was different. she made him stand in front of the class n pull his ears. i remember clearly tis was the onli case tat yr when she made someone pull his ears…i personally feel tat the teacher deliberately punished him in front of the class to warn the rest of us tat if we made any noises, we would end up like him. it was funny to watch but boy, was it embarrassing for my classmate!!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think when the classmate grow up, the teacher will not punish them like pull ears.</p>
              <p>If the children is young, that in primary school, they pull ears are more interesting.</p>

              i tink when ear pulling is given as punishment at secondary levels onwards, its usually few n far btw...plus when they r given at higher levels of education, it is usually given when the teacher sees a need to treat the student like a small kid n also to issue a warning to the rest of the class...
              
              if u trace back a few pages in tis thread, u will find a forumer who is from china who shared tat ear pulling is the most common punishment in his country...in fact according to him, students as old as secondary 4 would be asked to pull their ears while standing at open places in their schools...
              
              yet having said tis, i must say tat ear pulling does appear to be one of the most common punishments u can find in schools..kids as young as those in kindergarten can be found pulling their ears while standing at a corner of the classroom..tis is one punishment method i feel will not die off for a long time..

              the principal who made the 2 gals stand by the flagposts for the whole morning was known to be very strict back then...in fact, according to my cousin, those 2 gals were not the onli ones to receive harsh punishments from tat principal...he remembered a case tat happened when he was in secondary 2. tis case involved 3 students who were punished for toking n giggling in class...
              
              on tat fateful day, one of the teachers teaching my cousin's class was on medical leave...they were waiting for the relief teacher to come into class when the principal walked in n told the class tat she would be relieving the teacher for tat period...after greeting the class, she instructed the class to do revise their work quietly b4 sitting at the table to do her admin work...
              
              minutes later, giggles were heard from the back of the class...looking up, the principal saw 3 students(2 boys n a gal)toking n giggling away...furious, the principal ordered them to stand next to her table n asked them wad they were giggling abt...the 3 students didnt tell her but instead stood there n kept grinning. seeing tat they were unrepentant, the principal got angrier n ordered them to stop grinning n answer her qn...tis time, one of the boys burst out laughing. the other 2 students soon followed...the principal lost her patience completely n pulled the students apart...she made them stand in one row, facing the class...then she raised her voice n scolded them. she scolded tat since they enjoyed grinning, she will grant them their wishes...
              
              wadever happened after tat was an interesting sight!!! the principal ordered the students to face the class n grin hard. she made sure they grinned wif their teeth showing n angrily ordered them to keep grinning until she was satisfied...b4 resuming her work, she warned the class not to laugh at them or they will be punished in the same manner...
              
              it was a rather harsh punishment..the principal made the students grin in tat manner for the entire period!!! moreover, she didnt allow any slacking at all. there were 2 occasions when the students were caught not grinning. on both occasions, the principal made the students slap themselves twice on the cheeks b4 making them resume grinning...she even threatened to make them slap themselves for the rest of the period if they were caught slacking again...my cousin recalled tat the gal was on the verge of crying at the end of it..from their faces, it was obvious their cheeks were very tired from prolonged grinning yet the principal did not let them off until the end of the period. in fact, b4 releasing them, the principal asked if they still enjoyed grinning n said tat if they havent had enuff, they could stay back after school wif her n continue grinning outside her office until 3pm tat day...she onli released them when they said tat they had enuff of grinning n promised not to be rude to her again...

              regarding the principal above, my cousin recalled tat it was common for students to call her all sorts of names behind her back...in fact, hardly any student liked her. the principal was aware tat students often called her names behind her back n warned the students b4 tat if she ever caught anyone calling her names, tat person would be punished severely...
              
              my cousin related a case where a student was punished for calling the principal names...apparently, the principal happened to walk past a classroom n heard the student calling her a big mouth b***h. the student had his back turned towards the principal n hence didnt see her. furious, the principal hauled the student out n scolded him severely...she ordered him to report to her 1st thing the next morning b4 assembly...
              
              during assembly the next morning, the errant student was found standing next to the principal as she spoke to the school...the principal announced the incident to the whole school n warned tat she will not tolerate such rude behaviour...b4 she dismissed the assembly, she announced tat the student will be severely punished to serve as a stern warning to the rest of the students. wif tat she ordered the errant student to go n stand in front of the flagpole. in the end, as a punishment, he was made to stand facing the flagpole n shout: I MUST NOT BE RUDE!!! until the principal was satisfied...
              
              my cousin recalled how his class were laughing at the student...it was realli funny cos the student's shouts could be heard as lessons were going on...his teacher had a hard time trying to keep them quiet n to pay attention to the lesson. the poor student was made to stand facing the flagpole n shout for 1 entire period!! even then, he stil wasnt let off...during recess tat day, he was found standing facing the flagpole n shouting: I MUST NOT BE RUDE!!! for the entire recess!!!
              
              from various sources, my cousin found out tat the student was onli let off after recess...moreover, the principal made him write: i must not be rude 500 times as punishment after school tat day...indeed the principal was true to her word when she said tat whoever she caught caling her names would be severely punished...tat student back then was surely severely punished...

              ok...so to summarise the 5 cases my cousin cited where students were punished by the principal back then...
              
              1) my cousin n his frend were made to stand outside principal's office in a knee-bent position wif both hands stretched out in front of them for the entire recess for being noisy in class...they were in secondary 1.
              
              2) 2 secondary 2 students( a boy n gal) were caught nodding away during assembly. the boy had to pull his ears n do frog jumps outside principal office for almost whole recess. the gal had to pull ears n do half-squats outside office.
              
              3) 2 secondary 4 gals were late for school for more than the 3rd time. in the end, as punishment, both of them were made to stand next to the flagpoles for the entire morning
              (from 745am to ard 1pm)
              
              4) 3 students were caught giggling away in class n refused to tell principal wad the joke was abt. instead they laughed loudly in front of her. all 3 students were made to stand in facing whole class n grin continuously for whole period.
              
              5) boy was caught calling the principal crude names in class. he was made to stand in front of flagpole during 1st period n recess tat day n shout: I MUST NOT BE RUDE!!! on top of tat, he had to write out "i must not be rude" 500times after school...
              
              from the 5 cases above, which do u guys tink were harsh, overly harsh or not harsh at all???

              <p>Singaporean schools are fucking crazy from the stories here. It wouldn't  be so bad if it was just regular punishment but it's public humiliation as well. Teachers at my school and schools in Australia can be sued for that and will lose their job if they are caught doing any of the stuff mentioned here.</p>
              <p>They're not even allowed to lay a hand on students. One time a friend of mine was in detention and his teacher grabbed the back of his collar and pulled him out of his seat forcefully which hurt him so he turns around and punches the teacher in the face, knocking him to the ground. My friend didn't get into any trouble at all because if the school found out about it the teacher would've lost his job for handling a student like that.</p>

              <p><br>that was back in the old days. Students dont give much damn about teachers now. If the teacher leave the classroom, they will celebrate and say pls go.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The students can just walk out of the classroom if they want. Students are highly protected these days as schools dont dare to expel them. Just one apology letter and they can sit for the exams.</p>

              hello everyone!!! i still remember tat for most of us during our schooldays, we were taught tat we were to raise up our hands if we wanted to speak. tis was especially so for primary n secondary education. i wonder if tis unspoken rule is still in place today. i noe of cases when teachers would scold the students if they spoke during lessons without raising their hands 1st. for some cases, the students may be punished, most commonly by standing at a corner. i recall a case way back in primary one when a classmate of mine was punished for interrupting the teacher without raising his hands 1st. it must be noted tat he had a bad habit of interrupting teachers when they r teaching without raising his hands 1st. he was nvr punished until tat particular incident tat yr...
              
              it was during chinese class...we were all sitting on the floor in front of the teacher who was conducting the lesson on the blackboard. she wrote on the board, turning now n then to explain certain words to us. it was a double period tat day n it was her practice to teach for the 1st period b4 sending us back to our seats to do our work the 2nd period. in the midst of teaching, tat student interrupted her by commenting on certain things she said. the teacher got angry at his interrupting(not by wad he said) n scolded him for being rude.she even pointed out tat it wasnt his 1st time interrupting her like tat without asking for permission to speak. furious, she decided to punish him...
              
              wadever happened after tat was unusual...the teacher ordered the student to stand up n repeat the following statement after her in chinese: i must raise my hands before i speak(yao shuo hua xian ju shou). then she ordered him to go n stand at the back of the classroom n keep repeating the statement again n again until she was satisfied. the lesson went on smoothly after tat. i remember clearly tat tis teacher didnt usually have the habit of punishing us for long periods. hence, i was expecting her to release the student after she had finished teaching.
              
              it turned out not to be so...after sending us back to our seats, the teacher simply sat down at her table to do her work. i knew tis teacher to be someone who would not forget to release students from their punishments so it is apparent tat she didnt forget for tis case either. yet, she just continued to do her work, leaving the poor student standing at the back of the classroom reciting the same statement again n again. 
              
              in the end, the poor student had to recite the same statement again n again until the end of the lesson...he was seemingly tired out at the end of it. i remember tat during the 2nd period, i walked past him twice n witnessed his "sufferings". his recitations were slow n lifeless. he was taking deep breaths in between each recitation. he was suffering so badly cos he didnt stop at all, even when the teacher wasnt looking. though his recitations werent loud, it was still audible from where i was sitting n i noticed tat he didnt stop even once to rest. the teacher onli allowed him to stop n go back to his seat when the bell rang, signalling end of lesson...it was an unforgettable experience for him as he did become less rude after tat...

              some of my personal tots abt the incident mentioned above...
              
              1) was the teacher too harsh wif my classmate? personally i feel tat she wasnt wrong to punish him for being rude. after all, he had a habit of doing so n as a teacher, it was her duty to correct n guide students up the rite path. however, did she overdo the punishment? my classmate was made to do recitation for more than half an hr without stopping..it must also be noted tat we were onli in pri 1 then. while it seemed justifiable to punish him, was it justifiable to punish him for more than 1 period in tat manner?
              
              2) the teacher was not one who would forget to release students from their punishments. tis could be seen by the fact tat she called out to my classmate b4 leaving the class, asking him to stop reciting n go back to his seat. tis meant tat she remembered all along tat he was being punished. hence, it seemed pretty obvious tat the teacher deliberately punished him until the end of the lesson. her intentions would then be clear tat she meant to punish him harshly, making him learn from the horrid experience not to repeat his habit of interrupting..
              
              3) was the teacher ignorant to my classmate's sufferings? remember he was standing at the back of the classroom while the teacher was in front at her table. as i mentioned above, i witnessed my classmate's sufferings but was the teacher aware of it? if she was aware, would she have released him or at least allow him to stop reciting for a while to catch a breather? personally i feel tat the teacher wasnt aware of his sufferings. although she was known to be very strict, she wasnt known to be inhumane. i guess she ASSUMED tat continuous recitation, though punishing, wasnt too torturous. hence, she allowed the punishment to continue until the end of lesson. perhaps it was due to tis wrong assumption she made tat caused my classmate to suffer much from the punishment.
              
              a final tot...maybe the teacher knew my classmate was suffering but still didnt release him. if tis was the case, then i would conclude tat she was inhumane in tis case. she knew he was suffering, yet in her intention to make him learn from his actions, she ignored his sufferings totally. i cannot tell for sure if she was aware of his sufferings. however, i know tat if she had released him after she had send us back to our seats after teaching, my classmate would not have suffered from mild breathlessness n lethargy in his voice...

              the recitation punishment above was not the onli one i encountered during my sch days...i remember another incident in pri 3. tis case involved 2 of my classmates who were punished for not speaking up when they needed to. however, the punishment in tis case was less harsh in the sense tat the teacher didnt punish them for the whole lesson. below was wad happened...
              
              my form teacher came into class tat day. after greeting the class, she began commenting abt the test we did a few days ago. it turned out tat the class fared badly on the whole n she spent the 1st 10min scolding the whole class b4 distributing our papers back to us. i remember it was double period tat day n after spending the 1st period going thru the answers wif us, she proceeded wif the lesson proper. it was obvious then tat she was still angry wif the class for doing badly in the test n so nobody dared to tok when she was teaching...
              
              as the teacher taught she began to ask qns along the way..i remember the 1st qn she asked was concerning the passage in the textbk n she called a boy to answer it. the boy, for goodness noes wad reason, mumbled his answer. the teacher lost her patience n told him to speak up n not to mumble like tat. she then called another student to answer the same qn n tat student also spoke softly. i believe they did tat cos they were afraid to give the wrong answer. when tat happened, the teacher lost her patience completely. she stopped teaching n scolded the whole class again. she scolded us for not speaking up in class n no wonder we did so badly in our test. it seemed apparent to her tat we did badly cos we dun bother to speak up n ask qns when in doubt. she ended off by saying: ALRITE!!! since u ppl r not interested to learn, then i shant bother to teach anymore!!! the whole lot of u shall sit at ur places n do wadever u want...
              
              the teacher went back to her seat n sat down, looking very cross. she looked at the 2 boys who had been standing all tis while n ordered them to come forward. she then made each of them stand at either side of her table n face the blackboard. then as punishment for not speaking up when required, she made them repeat: "i must speak up in class!" loud enuff for her to hear. she left them instructions to keep repeating the phrase until she was satisfied.
              
              the punishment lasted abt 10min...after releasing the 2 students, the teacher stood up n looked at the class sternly saying tat she is not going to care abt us anymore since we r not interested to learn. then to our shock, she took up her things n walked out of the class. it wasnt the end of the lesson yet n we didnt noe wad to do at tat time. 1st i must state tat our form teacher had always been very caring towards us. although she was strict abt certain things, the class on the whole liked her. hence, quite a number of us felt guilty at upsetting her like tat.
              
              in the end, our class monitor ran out of the class to get our teacher back. after abt 5min, he came back wif her. then he led the whole class to say sorry to her. we promised to be gd students n not to make her angry again. i still can remember us staying back after sch tat day for extra lesson to make up for wad we missed tat day n nobody misbehaved or made the teacher angry. the teacher forgave us in the end, telling the 2 students tat she punished them for their own gd n she hoped tat they will learn to speak up in future...to tis day, i can still remember tis touching incident...

              my form teacher in pri 3 was liked by many of us cos she realli knew how to relate to us. she was not one who would punish us for everything tat we do wrong. she believed in giving us chances n many times she would let us off wif a mere scolding or two. yet, there were occasions when she had no choice but to resort to punishments. such occasions usually happened either when she had alredi given us chances yet we still commit the same offences or when the offence committed was rather serious. even so, her punishments dun usually last very long. some of them can be rather embarrassing which were meant to make the student/s feel ashamed n hence deter them from doing wrong. one of them i must state is the ever famous one which required us to stand outside the classroom n pull our ears..
              
              i still remember tat she liked to make deals wif us. tis was a rather useful strategy as it often deterred us from doing wrong. for eg, if a student was found misbehaving in class, she would strike a deal wif him. she would ask the student which option he preferred for eg: 1) to stop misbehaving n do his work quietly n pay attention or 2) go n stand outside the classroom n pull ears for 15mins. no prizes for guessing which option he would choose. the teacher will then allow the offence to go unpunished but she would warn the student tat if he misbehaved again, she will have to punish him. such deals were quite successful as the student would behave properly after tat although there were cases when she had to punish us. now when i tink back, its no wonder y we liked her so much. she nvr treated us unreasonably n hardly anyone complained when they were being punished. cos we knew she punished us for our own gd n tat we deserved to be punished in those occasions.
              
              tis teacher of ours told us b4 tat she hate to punish her students. yet, as a teacher, it was her responsibility to teach n guide us. so when theres a need to give out punishments, she will have to do it. although she hardly punished any of us for long periods, we knew her to be rather strict when it came to punishments. for eg, if a student was asked to stand at a corner n face the wall, he would be expected to stand wif both legs straight n no leaning against the wall. moreover, he was expected to stare at the wall n nowhere else.i remember the teacher scolding students on several occasions for not standing properly(stand on one leg) for eg. she would comment tat if they found it tough doing punishments, then dun commit wrongs n behave themselves. if they choose to misbehave, then face the consequences...
              
              personally, tis teacher above was one of the best i ever had. although strict wif punishments, she always tried not to punish us. she treated us wif care n often taught n guide us wif love. to tis day, i realli appreciate tis teacher...

              i recall one case tat yr when our form teacher had to punish 2 boys for misbehaving in class. it was b4 recess one morning...we were having double period wif the 1st period being maths n the 2nd being english. after having taught us certain concepts from the textbk, our form teacher left us wif some maths work to do while she went to the teacher's room to get sth. b4 she left, she gave us specific instructions to gd students n do our work quietly n wait for her to come back...
              
              everything went smoothly at 1st until somebody let out a shout n it was followed by laughter. 2 boys were making fun of each other. 1 of them was poking the other on his sides, causing him to laugh loudly. moments later, the teacher nxt door came in n the 2 boys kept silent. the teacher asked where our teacher was n then proceeded to scold us for disturbing her lesson. there was more to come minutes later. our form teacher came back into class, looking angry. she stood at her table n ordered the ones who were playing a fool to own up. apparently, the teacher next door had complained to her. the 2 boys juz kept silent. seeing no response, our teacher got angrier n said:"very well!! since nobody wants to own up, all of u shall stay back during recess everyday until the culprits own up!!!" wif tat, the rest of us looked at the 2 boys, who had their heads lowered. seeing our reactions, the teacher called them to the front n instructed the rest of us to continue wif our work...
              
              i cun remember everything my teacher said to the 2 boys. all i noe is tat she scolded them for misbehaving. i onli remember tat after some scolding, she said to them:"because i did give u instructions but u chose to disobey, i have no choice but to punish the 2 of u! she pointed at the 2 corners in front of the classroom. "go n stand at those 2 corners n pull ur ears! stand facing the class n reflect on wad u have done wrong!!" the lesson proceeded on after tat. u could see from the boys' faces tat they felt quite embarrassed pulling their ears in front of the whole class. our teacher just continued teaching on the board, leaving the 2 boys standing at the corners, reflecting on wad they had done.
              
              the teacher onli released them at the end of the maths period. i estimate the punishment to have lasted not more than 20min. i personally feel tat our teacher was rite to punish them. she had always taught us to behave ourselves when the teacher was not ard n tat making alot of noises would disturb our neighbourin classes. also she did give us instructions to keep quiet n do our work. hence, her punishing the 2 boys was justifiable as they chose to disobey her instructions n didnt want to own up when she asked them to. yet despite cases like this when we were punished by her, she still remained as one of the teachers we liked during our pri school yrs...
