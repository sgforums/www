            <div class='col-md body'>I suppose practically all the teachers haf lost their professionalism in teaching already larh.. i mean, educators in the past used to haf a passion for teaching and will always haf the patience to imparting their knowledge to their students, to the extent of controlling their temper and not losing it..<br><br>But i guess it ain't the way it is now.. and of course.. i dun tink that punishing them harshly will solve the problem la.. practically it will only make the student hate the particular teacher.. and not forgetting the subject the teacher is teaching.. moreover, the student may become more rebellious and influence other students alongside to create for troubles for the teacher in future..<br><br>However, dun forget that the students nowadayz are being very rebellious and can easily get out of hand... i mean, juz look at those secondary or primary school kids.. and i suppose it's not up to their parents to take discipline into their own hands.. i tink teachers haf a part to play too..<br><br>But no matter wad, i still feel that teachers are NOT allowed to punish students harshly.. it will only show how uncivilised such educators are, instead of portraying them as passionate as we imagined...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, from my experiences in sch, its stil proven to me tat female teachers r more 'creative' in punishing students...they r the ones who inflict punishments which r more psychological rather than physical...when i was in primary sch, i encountered several female teachers who had a wide variety of punishments. they include things like ear-pulling, standing wif book on top of ur head, recitation(repeating a statement again n again until they tell u to stop), doing half-squats while pulling ur ears, slapping urself, walking up n down the corridor for 1 whole period cos u were caught walking ard the class without permission...i myself was a victim of a few of these...<br><br>i recall an incident in primary sch...it was during a prize presentation rehearsal...when we went to the hall for rehearsal, we saw 2 boys each standing at 1 corner of the stage on top pulling their ears...we later found out tat they were being punished by the teacher-in-charge of the rehearsal. to make it worse, the teacher made them stand facing us. we could see how embarrassed they were. n the teacher kept thenm there thru out the entire rehearsal!!! so while we were rehearsing, those 2 boys were being punished. can u imagine how embarrassed they muz have felt?? n how tired they muz have been for standing for such a long period??? again, it was done by a female teacher...hmmm...y do female teachers seem to believe in psychological punsihments rather than physical ones?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hello....so wif reference to the case above...do u forumers tink the teacher did the rite thing?<br><br>i personally feel she meant well...the punishment was harsh; i was a victim to it once...but come to tink of it...toking in class is a common thing to do in class...the teacher had to tink for those students who were busy doing thier work quietly...besides, she was harsh but nt unreasonable...she would nt overdo the punishment...none of us ever went back in tears from the aching n pain inflicted on us...our arms were painful but stil bearable...there were of cuz repeated offenders who were unrepentant despite 1st punishment...the teacher would mete out the same punishment but wif a longer duration...a few of my classmates who went thru tis had to keep their hands straight up for almost entire period...u could the grimace on some of their faces after more than 15min...usually the teacher will onli release them after punishing them for close to half an hr n making them promise not to tok in class again...<br><br>i recall a case in fact where a talkative student who had been punished a few times b4 for toking was caught toking away in class again...infuriated, the teacher ordered him to the front...but tis time she made the student bring his sch bag along to the front...after scolding him a while, she ordered him to stand next to her table n carry his schbag above his head, keeping his hands straight up...it was a painful experience for the student...in less than 10min, he was alredi grimacing from the pain but the teacher ignored his grimace n ordered his hands to remain straight up...tis was the onli incident during tat yr tat the teacher showed no mercy...in the end, the teacher onli released the student when she saw tears rolling down his eyes...she gave him a stern warning tat if he disrupted the class again, she will make him knee-bend n carry his bag above his head for the entire lesson...<br><br>it appears clear to me tat the teacher did tat for our own gd...she was juz doing her job to educate us on the rite values in classroom...<br><br>it is interesting though how the teacher got started on tis method of punishment...will tok abt tis in my next post..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe teacher should be allowed to punish student in school, but not "harshly" as stated on the topic title.<br>Infact the topic title is acting like a trap that only allow you to disagree or be called a dictator.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Just a quick one, have anyone seen "I am not stupid 2"?<br><br>Student these day are not like those from my time.

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually more interestingly, what sort of punishments do u think a teacher SHOULD mete out that is EFFECTIVE?<br><br>For...<br><br>1) Not doing homework<br>2) Not being responsible -i.e. never bring textbook when told<br>3) Rudeness<br>4) Repeatedly talking in class<br>5) More serious stuff such as stealing, fighting, gambling etc.<br><br>Of course the punishments for Primary and Secondary sch wld be different. so what do u suggest?</div>
