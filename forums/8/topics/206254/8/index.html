            <div class='col-md body'>well, according to sources, ever since tis teacher became DM, the sch discipline level has improved dramatically..during her 1st yr as DM, it was common to see students being punished outside her office everyday. the thing is students r very fearful of her so when they r being punished, few dared to 'cheat' on the punishment...consequences for 'cheating' on punishment r extremely severe, hence hardly anyone dared to 'cheat'.<br><br>those punished outside her office r usually repeated offenders or students who commit serious offences like truancy, fighting in sch or smoking. boys n gals alike will be given extremely harsh punishments wif long durations...it has been said tat all students who were punished outside her office ended up crying buckets from the pain suffered in their legs n hands. for slapping punishments, students will go away wif swollen n painful cheeks. u have to imagine carrying ur bag above ur head for durations like more than an hr without rest while kneeling on marbles or knee-bending. the same can be said for slapping where students were made to slap each other/themselves for more than an hr wif each slap being hard n painful...<br><br>wif punishments like tat, its no wonder the sch's discipline has improved dramatically n nowadays serious offences r hardly committed...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, from my pt of view, punishments basically have 2 forms...<br><br>1) the 'more than enuff' type: tis is when punishment takes on in an excessive form...in such cases, offender is made to do a particular thing at an extremely high frequency until he/she gets sick n tired of doing it...<br><br>example: student caught walking ard the classroom for no apparent reason...<br>punishment: made to walk ard the whole sch for 1 entire period without stopping...<br>example: student caught making faces at classmates by sticking his tongue out...<br>punishment: made to stick his tongue out with face puffed up for 1 entire period...<br><br>2) the "opposite consequence" type: tis is when punishment is aimed at deterring offender by inflicting pain or shame with opposite effects...<br><br>example: student caught using vulgarities in class...<br>punishment: slapping himself hard in front of whole class for entire period...the slapping is the opposite consequence of using vulgarities...<br>example: student caught toking in class...<br>punishment: student's mouth is taped up for entire lesson to stop him from toking...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wif regards to tis teacher, it has been said tat her punishments nvr failed to bring forth much pain n agony...even the most basic one which is to kneel n pull ears has proven to be agonising to students...she would make them do tat for the entire lesson n tis can be realli painful for lessons tat r more than 1 period long...although tis punishment dun usually make students cry, it often gave them sore knees for rest of the day...<br><br>for the harsher ones, hardly anyone could last for entire lesson...students will be seen crying even after onli 10-15min...usually, these students will be released once they r seen crying n unable to cont the punishment...for repeated offenders or serious offences, most of them may nt be released despite crying buckets...they will be expected to keep up the punishemnt until teacher released them...such cases usually involved punishments wif long durations of more than an hr...teacher wil determine how long to punish them based on the severity of the offence...the long duration n harshness of the punishments r meant to act as strong deterrance against the offences committed...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>from wad i noe, the worst place to be punished is next to tat teacher's table in class...students punished next to her table nvr get away wif slacking...tis usually happens when teacher has finish teaching n has left the class alone to do some work...she wil sit at her table n mark bks...students punish next to her table during tis period suffer the worst possible plight...the teacher will give no room for slacking at all...<br><br>for knee-bending cases, the teacher wil ensure student's knees r kept bent at ard 60 degrees thru out...for kneeling cases, teacher wil ensure knees r kept bent at 90 degrees thru out...for lifting of bags, student's hands have to be kept straight up wif elbows locked..any form of slacking will be greeted by scolding n prolonged or harsher punishments...<br><br>wif punishments like these, its no wonder students were left crying at the end of it...the tiredness n pain suffered is immense...the onli saving grace is tat some rest may be given at times though tis was rare...students in such cases may have their punishments lighten...eg from kneeling wif bags lifted above head, student may be asked to put his bag down n pull his ears instead...however, rest is usually given onli when student is alredi crying in pain n tiredness...<br><br>until today, tis teacher remains the one who metes out the harshest punishments i ever known...any of u came across punishments of similar harshness?</div>
