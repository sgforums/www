              Wow... that friend of yours seems really interesting. I wonder if her students are afraid of her interesting punishments or are they eager to try? Haha ... for me, I don't think I can bend and touch my toes. I can't imagine if I have to do that for punishment. :D By the way, is she very young and she started teaching immediately after graduation?

              Why don't suggest to her the traditional Korean "hands up" punishment? Or maybe stand on one leg like what my friend suggested? Both of them will not hurt the student physically.

              Well, in the movie which you shown me, some students cheated by bending their arms or having both palms together like what the girl did. However, she told me that her class always got punished this way because of a few troublemakers in the class. I asked her what happens if any students put down their arm and she said the duration will be extended. Perhaps the rules are harsher last time. She said she hated school days because of this and glad that she's now an adult and no longer need to attend school. I think every Korean students bound to experience this punishment even though they never made mistakes. I will ask her is she's online. Nowsdays she seldom online.

Then I told her about standing inside a small circle and she suggested that it should have been a triangle instead because triangle is smaller and the student cannot sit down. Haha...</div>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>teachers need to have some form of authority over the students, if not they will take the teacher for granted and walk ontop of the teacher's head. but u can't overdo it, like the eg given on the very first post. after the student was publically caned, the teacher still ask the student to slap himself. the teacher should have stopped abusing her authority, the student has enough damage both physically and psychologically.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>installing fear is best only when the student is young, ie pri sch. in sec sch, when the some of the students bcome mature, reasoning and counselling them could be other options to choose.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>when i was in sch, i admire teachers who are no push-overs, they are strict when they are suppose to be and yet to show their humorous side when the students behave. students enjoy lessons best in such environment.</span></p>
