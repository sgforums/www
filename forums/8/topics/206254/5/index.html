            <div class='col-md body'><p>actually, surprisingly, i noe of ppl who actually went back to sch to visit tat teacher. apparently, though they had been 'victims'of her harsh, sadistic punishments, they stil bother to visit her in sch during teachers' day.<br><br>my frend who was one of those who went back said tat the teacher was stil the same except she looks much older now. he wnet back few days b4 teachers' day one particular yr. according to him, tis teacher is stil as punishing as ever. he n his frends went to a classroom where she was teaching to send their greetings. guess wad they saw? there were 2 boys kneeling on bottle caps at the back of the classroom, slapping themselves. in front of the class was another gal who was kneeling n pulling her ears. they later found out tat those 2 boys were caught behaving rowdily in class b4 her lesson n were exchanging crude words. the gal forgot to bring her bks. in fact, after they were finished toking to the teacher, my frend witnessed the teacher walking to the back of the class where the 2 boys were being punished...earlier, they had been seen looking tired n hence were nt slapping themselves hard...<br><br>teacher: WAD DID I TELL U TO DO??? I TOLD U TO SLAP URSELVES RITE! U CALL TAT SLAPPING??? (the 2 boys resumed slapping, seemingly tired n in pain) Y R U NT KNEELING PROPERLY??? BUTTS UP, BOTH OF U!!! DO U WANT ME TO MAKE U KNEEL ON MARBLES??? (boys shook their heads) TIS IS MY LAST WARNING TO U BOYS...IF I CATCH U SLACKING AGAIN, U WIL KEEP TIS UP FOR ANOTHER PERIOD...N U WIL SLAP EACH OTHER INSTEAD WHILE KNEELING ON MARBLES, DO U HEAR ME?! (boys nodded)<br><br>teacher(to the gal): TIS APPLIES TO U AS WELL!!! KEEP UR BUTTS UP N PULL UR EARS HARDER!!! ANY SLACKING FROM U N U WIL SLAP URSELF LIKE THOSE 2 BOYS!!!<br>in the end, all 3 students were punished for 1 entire period...in total, the 2 boys had to kneel on bottle caps n slap themselves for no less than half hr...the gal also spent half hr kneeling on the hard floor n pull her ears...well, it seems like a leopard nvr changes its spots. she is stil meteing out punishments that bring forth much pain n shame...</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>from wad i noe, the teacher who metes out sadistic punishments always dress smartly to sch. she was nt onli unique in punishments but also dressing. she would dress like an office lady. according to my info, she would come to sch in long-sleeve blouses, office skirts/pants n high-heeled office shoes.<br><br>wad made her dressed like tat could be cos she worked in the corporate world for a few yrs after graduating. in fact, while its often stereotyped tat onli old teachers wil mete out such punishments, she was onli in her 30s then. from wad i noe, actually she was quite pleasant-looking n had a nice smile. however, she got realli nasty when angered. nobody dared to have funny ideas abt her though some of the older students would gaze at her when she wasnt looking...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually, my frend n his former classmates had a chance to tok to tis teacher over a meal in the sch canteen when they visited her during teachers' day. they found out tat actually she noes tat students hate hr for the way she punishes them n tat they call her all kinds of names behind her back.<br><br>she was even aware tat her punishments r extremely harsh. but she explained tat she has to do it. according to her, she doesnt like punishing ppl. tats one of the main reasons y her punishments r so harsh. she wants the student to learn from the 1st punishment n nt repeat the offence ever again. she noes tat other teachers will go lighter on punishments but she noted tat very often students dun learn even after several rounds of punishments. so by meteing out punishments of such nature, she hopes at students will learn from the 1 experience.<br><br>in her 20odd yrs of teaching, she has punished many students. yet nothing pleases her more than to see these students doing well in life n developing gd character.some of the most hard-core students have since become successful ppl in life. in fact, she herself came from a very strict family. her parents would make she n her 3 siblings kneel or knee-bend for long periods when they do sth wrong. there was once when the 4 of them cooked up a lie tgr. when they were caught, they were made to kneel 2-by-2, facing each other n made to slap each other on the cheeks for an entire afternoon!!! according to her, tis lasted no less than 3 hrs!!! then they were made to go without dinner tat day. their cheeks were so swollen tat they bled. hence, she understand the kind of pain her students go thru when they r being punished.<br><br>she finally ended by saying tat all these yrs she meant gd for her students n tat she always saw then as her very own children. well, tat is true or not, nobody noes...though my frend feels she is speaking the truth</div>

That year was like hell to me. everytime she hear noise in class during lessons, she would say its me even though is not me. not talking only, fighting also i in wrong, just by looking at someone also wrong.<br><br>one time, someone lost the wallet(very rich), and the person is the one who sit beside me, teacher very very fast say its me, i was angry and said no its not me, but she was loud as unusual and insisted was me. then next day the teacher found the wallet back to the student, inside the wallet with over hundred of bucks ( suppose to pay for robotics enrichments ) was missing.<br><br>later its found that the teacher stole it and was fined and sacked.<br><br>i also have and teacher, in secondary school,<br>he allowed noisiness in class during lessons, but he insisted talk contructively.<br>he was very very respected by anyone...... even gangsters.<br><br>whenever he wants attention, he would say : 'attention", then everyone would keep quiet and look at him de.<br><br>even during gang fights, he say :" fighting no good" then all the gangster will walk away.<br><br>ppl so respected him, not because he is fierce or violent, but he is caring, reasonable, he is also quite humorous.<br><br>so so........ back to the 1st sentence,<br><br>when u say teacher are inhumane, it would rather be unfair to the good teachers out there.<br><br>when u say teacher are too caring, wat about the fierce and evil teachers?<br><br>same goes to kids, there are good and bad, kind and evil.<br><br>so do not generalise it, generalising is usually unfair.<br><br>ah<br>Thank you<br><br>dont flame me if u disagree with me in anything hor.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if such punishments r nt allowed, then how come they were meted out? n tis teacher hasnt lost job. perhaps u need to noe tat some things in life r used as a cover-up or juz as a form of assurance to ppl. take for eg. in army when we perform guard duty, its suppose to be for the protection of the camp. but anyone who has done NS will tell u tat actually guard duty is onli for 'show'. seriously, if anyone wanna attack the camp, no amt of guard duty will be able to protect it. however, having guard duty gives the public the sense of safety tat the camp is being protected. so its juz a cover-up in a sense.<br><br>even when it comes to politics, everyone noes no government is free from corruption. the diff. is whether evidence can be found against them. do u realli tink PAP is corruption-free? ask anyone n they will tell u PAP is corrupted but they r gd at covering up their actions. so on the surface, they r clean. juz like on the surface, govt dun allow such punishments but behind the scene, we dunno how many teachers have done such things...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oh yes, my frend recalled a case tat happened in his class...it was during tat teacher's lesson. several students were giggling in class n despite given a 1st warning, they continued wif their giggles. infuriated, the teacher meted out a punishment tat was unusual. she ordered the students to the back of the class n made the 2 boys knee-bend facing each other. the 2 gals were asked to kneel facing each other. then she made them stretch out both their hands in front of them n proceed to tickle each other on the necks n armpits. the teacher instructed them to tickle til the other person burst out laughing. then she ordered they keep at it until she told them to stop.<br><br>in the end, the punishment was a success. the 4 students kept on giggling non-stop at the back of the class until near the end of lesson. it was rather amusing cos while they were feeling pain in their legs, they were laughing instead. according to my frend, they laughed until they were tired out. they were onli released when they promised never to giggle n disturb the class again.</div>
