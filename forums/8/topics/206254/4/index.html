            <div class='col-md body'>oh yes, n from the testimonies i heard regarding tis sadistic teacher. the requirements for kneeling is for the knees to come in full contact wif the hard object(floor, marbles or bottle caps) n legs r to be bent at 90 degrees. when marbles r used, students usually cun last more than 15min...teacher will onli release the students on 2 conditions: 1) its end of lesson, 2) the student is crying in pain...even if the student have been kneeling for a long time, the teacher wil nt release him unless he is crying in pain or its end of lesson.<br><br>moreover, the teacher is nt the kind who will mete out punishments n then leave the student alone. she will check on him/her occasionally. she has a habit of walking ard the class as she taught n so was able to spot check on her 'victims' at the same time. students found nt kneeling properly on the hard floor(eg. legs nt bend at 90 degrees) will be made to either kneel on bottle caps or marbles. if ears r nt pulled hard enuff, they may be made to carry their bags above their heads or slap themselves instead.<br><br>she often carried a small plastic bag containing marbles n bottle caps in her handbag. when punishment is meted out, she will march student/s to specific spots, place marbles/bottle caps on the floor n then order students to kneel on them. next she will determine wad to do wif their hands. tats when ear-pulling, carrying of sch bags, slapping of oneself comes in.<br><br>so from the above, u can see y she was feared by her students. she showed little mercy in her punishments. i noe some who were her 'victims'. all agree tat she is very brutal n sadistic n tat none of them couls withstand the kind of punishments she put them thru.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>anyway, to continue from above, there was a case where the teacher didnt release the student even when he was alredi crying buckets of tears...<br><br>it was a case involving vulgarities n rudeness. the teacher heard the student spewing vulgarities in class. infuriated, she ordered him to go to the back of the class to be punished. the student looked at her rebelliously n refused to bulged. he went on to tok back rudely at her. the teacher lost her temper completely n drag the student out of class near the doorway. she then made him kneel on marbles n to slap himself hard continuously. it was a double period tat day so the lesson was 1 hr long. thru out the lesson the teacher kept making sure the student knelt properly n slapped hard. as expected, after abt 15min, the student started crying in pain from his red swollen cheeks n hurting knees. to everyone's shock, the teacher didnt release him. even though she saw him crying, she continued to make him kneel properly n to slap himself hard...the student juz continued crying in pain as he obliged.<br><br>it was until end of whole lesson was the student let off. by then, he had been kneeling n slapping for <strong>almost 1 hr!!! </strong>he even had to be helped up by a fellow student. the teacher then warned the class tat any future usage of vulgarities or rudeness in her class will be punished in such a manner. tat was the onli case when the teacher was totally merciless. from wad i noe, the student limped n had swollen cheeks for the rest of the day.<br><br>wad do u forumers tink of tis? i feel its realli sadistic n way off.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When you have a hundred over thousand so-called teachers in Singapore who only work for the money, what else can you expect?<br><br>I think the Ministry of Education missed out one important point in the teachers' training: Psychological tests.<br><br>That way we won't have peanuts who only work for the money, and cowards who only know how to apply look-good-on-the-outside, ineffective, outdated and flawed methods of discipline.<br><br>Having said that, if you are bullied in school, don't tell the teachers. Call the authorities immediately. I regret reporting cases of bullying to my teachers. Totally ineffective and flawed way of handling the bullies.<br><br>If someone's fighting, call the police. If some guy comes and bullies you, tell your parents, don't tell the teachers, they are not your parents. That's only logic.<br><br>I get bullied, tell the teacher, warning issued, action is taken but not effective enough, bullying still continues. Talk about having Discipline Masters and school rules.<br><br>Like they say, security is not proclaimed, it is proven over time. So don't proclaim your education system to be world-class, it has to be proven at every link of the system first, you don't become world-class just by word of mouth alone.<br><br>If Bush knew more about all this, America's army would already be on its way here for a obvious purpose.<br><br>The Singapore Civil Service- losing our trust in every way we can.</div>

" its all the teachers' fault.. '<br><br>teachers also have parents Okie..<br><br>We really  have to put ourselves in the shoe of teachers at times.<br>They also wish to just step into the class, have good rapport with the kids and complete the lesson fruitfully. but sometimes, the audience is nt co-operative. and i think.. Talk to them nicely.. is too much at times..<br>Every time they did something wrong, the public just say..<br>" teachers shld talk to them NICely.. tell them.. . xxx..
