              <p> </p>
              <p>thanks for your response...wif reference to wad u said, it seems tat u are in full support of the modern way of guiding students which was very unlike our time in the 80s and 90s...however, it must also be noted that students nowadays are also known to be more rebellious and naughty...from ur experiences and those teachers whom u may noe, wads the best way to deal wif such delinquents??</p>

              </p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">There are no cheap and cheerful
              solutions in teaching. Anyone who promises you that probably has a
              bridge in San Francisco he'd happily sell you for $20.99 too. Every
              teacher has his own style and methods for 'getting through' to their
              kids. A quiet person can yell all he likes and he'll only end up
              being a roaring mouse. The kids are masters at spotting fakes.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">1) Care for them. Be sincere about it.
              If you're disappointed with their behaviour, tell them without
              couching your terms or speaking condescendingly.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">“You've really pissed me off today.
              You can behave like an asswipe all you like but you and I both know
              what your parents will do to you when you turn in crappy O-level
              results. Now, I'm trying to stop that from happening but it's very
              disappointing when it seems I'm the only one trying here. I've seen
              hundreds of smart asses come back, open their results slips and cry
              over it. Believe it or not, I care for you – and I don't want that
              to happen to you. Sooner or later, you WILL realise that. If you
              insist on behaving like this again and again, I'm going to send you
              permanently out and I will make you crawl through broken glass and
              barbed wire to get back in here again. Am I clear?”</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I actually said this to a problem
              student in my 4NA class, about 2 months ago; colourful language and
              all. He and I get along better now.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">2) You cannot have a 100% quiet and
              obedient class all the time. I have often settled for 60%; as long as
              my kids' learning objectives were fulfilled. Besides, classes that
              are totally quiet make me uneasy. They're hormonally-charged kids,
              not zombies.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">3) Don't beat yourself up when you have
              a 'bad lesson'. The kids will try their luck with you. They'll do it
              every class. It's in their nature. The trick is not to finish the job
              that some disrespectful kid started. I'm going to say something
              highly controversial here. Get ready for it. Here it comes:</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">“They're teenagers. This means that
              they often call on their entitlement to be utterly fuking STUPID.”</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">They're not wiser than us. Very few of
              them realise how badly they can hurt us (especially if we let them).
              They're just acting out a script they may have seen in some badly
              written teen drama on TCS8, or reciting rebellious lines from a
              scenario that a friend of a friend of a friend of some cool rebel in
              another school was in. They don't mean anything personal by it.
              They're just too dumb to know better. Consequently, don't take their
              words too much to heart and lose confidence in yourself. Or else,
              everyone loses.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">4) Everything can be sorted out if you
              speak to problem students on a 1-to-1 basis. True. Try it. Be
              prepared to LISTEN to what they have to say. Compromise, if you have
              to; negotiate, bargain and be sympa/empathetic. But be in control.
              This is not a contest of egos. It's 2 people trying to solve a
              problem in class.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">5) Make it up as you go along. When in
              doubt, refer to Technique #1 (above).</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">There's more. I've been finishing off
              my vodka. Consequently, it will have to wait. Not the vodka, mind you
              – the 'more' bit.</p>

              I agree with despondent. Basically, there are 2 forms of punishment in schools. Ether humiliation or torture. Humiliation becomes less effective if the punishment becomes a norm. Torture means getting caned or getting tired (e.g. raise hands etc).

              despondent: I am very busy recently so not much time to visit this site. By the way, I reliased that females seem to have better endurence than males. That is why when girls are given tiring punishments (e.g. raising hands or standing for long durations, they can last longer than the boys). When I saw some students being punished to stand outside staffroom during school days, the boys will start to move about after a while whereas the girls remain standing still there. There is also a reason why female teachers like to give tiring punihsments. Haha

              me to stay back during class with him when all the classmate left
              and let me stand facing the wall for 30 mins while he at his desk
              eyeing on me so i wont do anything stupid. i really hate that..

              Stand facing the wall is a very common punishment. My friend did that to a student when she was relief teacher in a sec sch. As what I mentioned before in one of my earlier post, She used masking tape to constructure a small square on the floor for the student to stand inside and drew a dot on the whiteboard to let the student stare at it. Haha so funny!

              Nice drama. I think it is very popular but I can't remember the name. Too bad, we can't understand what they are saying. I reliased in South Korea, most of the time its the girls being punished to raise hands. Are you glad you aren't born in South Korea? Haha

              Yes I watched it till the end. Erm ... how come this group of girls always get punished? Some girls raise their hands straight while some bend it slightly. Haha ... but I think the teacher don't really care. I wonder if the student will kena this punishment for forgetting to bring textbook. Haha

              Erm ... if I'm the teacher, I will not ask you face wall. I'll draw a small circle at the door and make you stand inside so that people who walk pass the classroom knows you're being punished. Isn't this a better idea?

              By the way, such punishments are now banned in South Korea. Those born in the 80s and earlier in South Korea all encountered this punishment before. Another common punishment was to carry chair above the head. I guess this punishment had become part of Korean culture and thus shown on Korean dramas. You'll sure see this punishment in all Korean dramas that involve school students. Haha ... my friend teaching in sec sch said that she wish she can do that to her students. She said they should raise hands for as long as its bearable. How long do you think it should last?
