              <p>Ha ha must use LOVE??!! Not sure about now...but even last time during my younger days...some teachers like dun care one lor...I can still remember the nasty teachers and their remarks!</p>
              <p>Don't the teacher understand that what ever they do to the students it will affect them for life?!</p>
              <p>Yes!! Teachers should punish kids that are playful so that they will behave and grow up a better person...but should find a better way to punish the student lor...if you show that you care I am sure the student will understand...after all we are all humans....got feeling one right?</p>

              Actually you can gain respect from the students, punishing them like make them write more home work?<br>
              
              I still remember I always fail for Chinese in Pri School and the best part of it?? I got A1 in GCE 'O' level!!! <br>
              
              Did punishment (e.g beating using cane etc) and harsh word make that happen?? No!! My Chinese teacher is super caring....all she does is tell us we have to work hard and the most make us do more homework LOL....guess that is the best ba....<br>

              <p>to bright498,</p>
              <p>severity is subjective. the case in my 1st post of tis thread, is tat considered severe offence? it must be noted tat was the 1st time the teacher caught my classmate using vulgarities in class. then there are also other cases in tis thread where the punishments were rather controversial in terms of harshness...</p>

              I'm really curious which primary school it is because the teachers there are so strict and have creative punishments.I don't think such punishments are allowed in other schools nowsdays.
