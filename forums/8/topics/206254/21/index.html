              <p>Hi despondent,</p>
              <p>Your teacher seems to be very harsh- not suitable for teaching, better in the army. In my days, teacher always right. Nowadays kids can just film the teacher and youtube em, and he loses his job. Times are changing. But regardless, if the teacher is good and just, we must respect them. We learn much from teachers. You can also learn a lot from this website:</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>i agree tat its diff nowadays...most of the punishments mentioned happened more than 10yrs ago n the teachers belonged to older generation where punishments were seen as the way to teach n guide students...its diff nowadays where teachers use the soft approach...however, how useful is the soft approach??? sad to say, i dun tink its very useful as students nowadays have become more rebellious...</div>

              from the pri sch gathering i had, my former classmates n i had a chance to recount our pri sch days...among the group was one of my pri 1 classmate who in tat yr was made to stand at the back of the classroom n do recitation for more than half an hr cos he rudely interrupted our chinese teacher without raising his hands for permission to speak 1st...apparently, our teacher decided to punish him as it wasnt the 1st time he had interrupted him like tat...
              
              from my classmate, i learnt tat it was the worst incident he encountered during his schooling days...he recalled tat he did feel quite tired at the end of it as he kept on reciting without stopping thru out the entire duration. like me, he also felt tat the teacher went overboard wif the punishment although he agreed tat the teacher was somewad rite to punish him for being rude.
              
              he further recalled tat actually the teacher onli checked on him until end of 1st period which was for ard 10min. she would glance at him nw n then as she tot the rest of the class to make sure he wasnt cheating on the punishment. when the lesson proceeded into the 2nd period, the teacher spent most of her time sitting at her table doing her work while the rest of the class did their work. during the 2nd period, the teacher hardly did any spotchecks on him. then i asked him y he didnt stop reciting n take a break when he felt tired since the teacher wasnt looking. my frend's answer can be broken up as follows:
              
              1) he was onli a pri 1 kid then. it realli didnt cross his mind at tat pt of time to cheat on the punishment. the tot onli came to his mind when he felt tired n saw tat the teacher wasnt looking. 
              
              2) although the teacher hardly spotchecked on him during the 2nd period, he pointed out tat after the teacher had sent the rest of the class back to their seats to do their work at the start of the 2nd period, she walked up to where he was standing at the back of the classroom(i have no recollection tat she did tat). she went up to him and gave him stern instructions. she ordered him nt to lean against the wall as he stood n instructed him tat he was nt allowed to stop reciting until she said so...
              
              3) our chinese teacher was known to be very strict n fierce. hence we were all rather fearful of her especially when she got angry n punished us. due to tis, my frend didnt dare to stop reciting even though he was feeling tired. true, she didnt spotcheck on him during the 2nd period but my frend was afraid tat she would make sudden spotchecks n tat he would be punished more harshly if he was caught cheating on the punishment...
              
              
              from his recollection, it seems obvious tat our teacher back then was bent on punishing him harshly for his rudeness...tis can be seen from the duration of the punishment as well as the instructions she gave to him. it was onli at the end of 2nd period tat the teacher called out to him as she was abt to leave to stop reciting n go back to his seat..my frend could not describe how relieved he felt when he was finally released from his agony...tis incident happened abt 20yrs back alredi...yet my frend n some of us can still remember it as we feel it was a case of the teacher punishing the student too harshly...

              from the gathering i mentioned above, i received more info abt the chinese teacher who tot us in pri 1...another of my classmate was punished harshly by her once in tat yr. i had no recollection of tis case until my classmate shared it wif me. he recalled tat on tat fateful day, we were asked to hand in our hmwork to the teacher. unfortunately for him, he had forgotten to bring his chinese bks tat day. hence, he was unable to hand in his hmwork, although he told the teacher tat he did complete his hmwork...
              
              as expected, the teacher would have none of it. she scolded him for being careless and said tat since he didnt bring his bks, then there was no pt for him to attend the lesson. my classmate remembered the teacher saying tat since he couldnt have lessons then he shall do some exercises instead. then she punished him by making him pull his ears in a criss cross manner n do half-squats at a corner while facing the class. the lesson proceeded after tat. my classmate recalled tat he felt very tired half-squatting continuously. yet he dared not stop to take a break as he was within sight from the teacher.
              
              in the end, my classmate had to do half-squats for nearly 20min. in fact, the teacher would have kept him at it until end of the period if he had nt shown he was too tired to carry on half-squatting anymore. even though, she allowed him to stop half-squatting, my classmate was still not allowed to go back to his seat. the teacher made him stand at the corner n pull his ears until end of the period. as a pri 1 kid then, my classmate remembered tat his legs felt very tired at the end of the period...he felt tat the punishment was too harsh for a pri 1 kid n we agreed tat our chinese teacher belonged to the older generation of teachers where harsh punishments r believed to be the way to discipline n guide students...
              
              there are 2 more cases shared by my classmates involving tis teacher...again, the punishments she meted out demonstrated the way teachers of her generation disciplined n guide students...will share them soon...

              i compare the recitation punishment my chinese teacher gave to my classmate in pri 1 to the one my form teacher gave to 2 boys in pri 3. the main difference btw these 2 punishments is tat the 1st one lasted much longer than the 2nd. the one tat happened in pri 3 lasted onli abt 10min. as i mentioned in my earlier posts, our form teacher in pri 3 was also known to be strict at times but she wasnt someone who believed in punishing students very harshly. it must be noted tat she was very angry wif the whole class tat day yet she didnt vent her anger on those 2 boys. she could have made them do recitation for the entire lesson but she let them off after abt 10min. she was one who believed in punishing lovingly. although some of her punishments were hard, they were always fair. as long as we do our punishments properly, she will let us off quite lightly.
              
              on the contrary, our chinese teacher in pri 1 made my classmate do recitation for more than half an hr. her punishments were hard n at times, very harsh. although she hardly punish us until we cried, her punishments were known to have inflicted pain n tiredness on whoever was doing them. it must be said though tat most of her punishments were effective as they did act as strong deterrance to the offenders...
              
              to conclude, both teachers had very contrasting styles in teaching n guiding students. although both methods turned out to be effective, it must be said tat one became effective by instilling fear into students while the other became effective by earning the respect n love from the students. for the former, we obeyed the teacher cos we feared her. for the latter, we obeyed the teacher cos we liked n respected her a lot. hence, we simply had no heart to make her sad or angry cos she showed her care for us readily enuff during those 2 yrs as our form teacher...
