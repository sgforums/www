              Hm... a small survey here:
              
              Suppose u're the teacher, how will you punish a naughty kid?
              
              1. Make him stand for a long period of time.
              2. Make him suffer from tiredness (e.g. stand and raise hands) for a short period like half hour.

              But then sometimes a teacher may be teaching the class more than 1 subject (e.g. English and Maths) and all her lessons may be together for 5 periods continously. If that's the case, the student will be punished throughout the 5 periods? Haha... then the student will be very unlucky.
              
              Duration of punishment also varies a lot. If the student forgets to bring textbook or never submit homework, he will be punished at the start of lesson and those who are caught talking will be punished in the middle of lesson. In that case, why don't the teacher note down names and punish the students the next lesson to ensure fairness? One of my teacher did that last time cos she wanted only 1 student to stand outside the staff room each day rather than 1 whole group stand there.

              <p><br>This is just an isolated and extreme case. Incidence whereby the teachers were being attacked are more and on the rise around the globe. Singapore see its fair share of such cases happen every other day. Some went unreported</p>

              Yeah, that's abuse and not punish. Well, there are so many ways to punish the girl without causing harm.

              <p>1. Make him stand for a long period of time.<br> 2. Make him suffer from tiredness (e.g. stand and raise hands) for
              a short period like half hour.</p>

              <p>Both cannot be done over here.</p>
              <p>For extremely naughty kids, I will work together with the PE teacher (if I am not in charge of PE for that class) to make sure the child doesn't get to play in the games during the PE lesson. Either that or I will keep the child in class during recess, provided of course I have food to offer to him.</p>
              <p>Now we can only implement punishment in the form of withdrawing things that the child enjoys, ie PE lesson etc.</p>
