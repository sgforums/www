            <div class='col-md body'>You guys asking for an end to physical punishment in school make me laugh.<br><br>THink about it this way...you take away the school's ability to punish students physically...so what are you left with? The answer: Detention, Suspension and Expulsion.<br><br>Detention won't work for many students because they will probably kbkb during detention.. what then? Suspension and expulsion lor...<br><br>-sigh- here endeth the lesson.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>from the info i got, for the case mentioned abt the primary 5 boy who drew a pen*s on his textbk, tat teacher would probably punish him in several ways...the student will probably be given a combination of a few punishments...there were cases when students were caught nt paying attention in class n drawing obscene things on their bks...tis was wad tat teacher did...<br><br>(student caught nt paying attention n drawing obscene things on his textbk)<br><br>teacher: U!!! WAD R U DOING?! (looks at student's bk) HOW DARE U DRAW SUCH OBSCENE THINGS ON UR BK?! U HAVE VERY ITCHY FINGERS RITE?! COME HERE!!! (teacher marches student to the front of the class) PUT UR PALMS FACING DOWN ON THE FLOOR!!! KEEP UR FINGERS CLOSED N KNEEL ON THEM!!! U WILL REPORT TO ME AFTER SCHOOL TODAY!!!<br><br>in the end, student was made to kneel on his fingers for entire lesson. after sch tat day the student was found in a classroom wif the teacher...he was made to write out 1000 times: i must nt draw obscene things in my bk. on top of tat, he had to do it without a chair...he had to knee-bend at the table n write...he was onli released after he had completed writing out 1000 times...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wif relation to the case above, the student had sore fingers after tat lesson...u can imagine his whole body weight being pressed against his thin n bony fingers...in fact from wad i noe, after sch tat day, when he knee-bend at the table n wrote out 1000 times: i must nt draw obscene things on my bk as punishment, he was crying buckets...probably cos of his sore fingers from kneeling on them n also the pain coming from his legs as he knee-bent...in the end he had to knee-bend for more than an hr as he was allowed to stand up onli after he had finished writing 1000 times...<br><br>the student sure did learn his lesson after tat...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>there was an incident of 2 boys caught smoking outside sch. they were marched into the DM office. tis teacher made them kneel on marbles outside her office n carry their bags above their heads. on top of tat, they each had to hold 5 unlit cigarettes btw their lips thru out the punishment! guess how long they were punished??? for HALF A MORNING!!! from the time assembly ended at abt 745am until recess time at ard 10am! u can imagine the pain n suffering those 2 boys went thru...worse than being caned...<br><br>in fact, the teacher even made special arrangements tat day for all her classes during that punishment period to be held outside her office. so for tat 2 hrs or so, u could see classes going to the DM office to have their lessons outside. she did tis so tat she could keep an eye on the 2 boys. according to my frend, those 2 boys were nt given any rest at all. when his class had their lessons tat morning, those 2 boys were seen crying thru out. the onli thing the teacher did to ease their agony was to allow them to shift their arms occasionally. from lifting their bags abvoe their heads, she would change it to putting their bags on top of their outstretched arms. she would do tis every half hr. however, they were kept kneeling on the marbles thru out wif legs bent at 90 degrees....so isnt it true tat tis punishment acts as a better deterrent than caning?</blockquote>wif relation to tis case, there were similar cases of smoking tat happened after tis one...according to my frend, the punishment for smoking is the same...he recalled another similar case tat happened to 3 other boys in tat same yr...like the above case, they too were caught smoking outside sch...they were from the calss next to my frend's...after morning assembly tat day, the teacher went to tat class for lesson, wif the 3 boys walking behind her...<br><br>teacher: gd morning class!!!<br>class: gd morning mdm!!!<br>teacher: nw i wan u to keep quiet n revise ur work while i deal wif these boys! anyone i catch toking wil be punished, u hear me?<br>class: yes teacher!!!<br>teacher(to the 3 boys): GO TO THE BACK OF THE CLASS N TAKE UR BAGS WIF U!!!

U WIL STAY IN TIS POSITION UNTIL THE END OF TIS LESSON, IF ANY CIGARETTE DROPS OUT, U WILL BE IN TROUBLE!!! U WILL REPORT TO ME AFTER SCH FOR AN EXTRA 15MIN OF PUNISHMENT FOR EVERY CIGARETTE TAT U DROP, DO U HEAR ME?!!!<br><br>it was a double period tat time so the boys had to stay in tat position for a whole hr!!! it was a very tiring n painful 1hr for them n they ended up crying buckets...despite tis, the teacher didnt allow any slacking at all...she ensured the boys kept their hands straight up n knees bent at 90 degrees thru out the 1 hr!!! to make it worse, none of the boys were able to keep all the cigarettes btw their lips until end of lesson. in fact, by the end of the lesson, there were more than 20 cigarettes lying on the floor...in the end, each of them had to stay back after sch for extra punishment of at least an additional 90min!!!<br><br>guess wad their extra punishment was? they had to spend the entire duration kneeling on marbles, bags lifted above their heads wif elbows locked n hold 10 cigarettes each btw their lips...again, they were warned nt to drop any cigarettes or their punishment would be prolonged continuously...to make it worse, the teacher made them kneel next to the teacher's table while she marked her bks so they couldnt slack at all...she smacked them wif a ruler each time their arms or legs slacked a little...well, the gd news is they managed to survive the ordeal n didnt have to serve anymore extra punishment...but all 3 boys ended up crying buckets n their arms legs were so tired n painful after tat...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think teachers should be given some discretion to wield punishments for students right up to junior college/pre-u  but it depends on what wrong the student has committed. Beyond that age, the student probably has the audacity to challenge the teacher and question authority liao.......  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>but well we noe tat its humanly impossible to do the punishments for such a long period without any rest at all...so as my frend recalled, students r allowed to slack for very short periods...however, tis usually happened when the teacher is convinced tat the student couldnt carry on the full punishment n needed rest...there were times when teacher will walk past the student being punished n pretended nt to see the student slacking...<br><br>slacking though has limits...teacher onli allowed a little slacking...eg. for carrying of bags above heads, teacher may allow student to bend his/her elbows a little after seeing the student in tears...for kneeling on marbles/bottle caps, she may allow students' butts to rest on their heels or for them to kneel on the floor instead...sometimes, teacher will change the punishment to sth lighter(asking students to pull ears instead)...she will usually set a time limit for slacking..students will be asked to resume the full punishment(elbows locked, kneel at 90 degrees etc) after being given some rest...however, students who constantly tried to 'cheat' will nt be given rest at all...<br><br>so we can see from the above tat though her punishments r extremely harsh, tis teacher is stil humane after all...<br><br></div>
