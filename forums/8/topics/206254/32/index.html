              Hey, thanks for the video. Hm.... Jesseca really look like a teacher. Her dressing and behavior is like a typical teacher and I think she acted this role very well. Do you think she is strict to punish the boy just because he said 1 sentence that is wrong? I guess this is her favourite punishment cos she asked another boy how he was punished last month. Haha... I wonder how facing the blackboard makes a different from facing the class.

              Is this female friend the teacher who punished her students to stand tip toe? That is indeed a very interesting punishment and she must be very creative. It's like wearing an imaginary high heels shoe. Maybe it also trains the student to wear heels. Haha...

              tip-toe is not sth one can do for a long time...the maximum
              duration my frend ever got any of her students to stand tip-toe was
              for nearly 1 period. even then, the students would complain tat
              their ankles felt sore..."wearing" imaginary heels is more tiring
              than wearing actual ones...</p>

              Yah loh.  Standing tip-toe is like wearing imaginary heels. Perhaps it is a good training for gals so they get used to heels. Haha... for guys, its a chance to feel how 's like to wear heels.

              I guess from the teacher point of view, shorter duration punishment is better. Standing tiptoe for half an hour is enough to make the student suffer. After the student is being released from punishment, he can then concentrate on the lesson.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, I got a taste of standing tiptoe now. Currently, I'm having some fungal infections on the soles of my feet and have to apply cream every night b4 going to bed. Usually after I applied cream, I will still go kitchen to get a drink and to wash my hands therefore have to tiptoe all the way. Its really tiring....</div>

              Oh thank you for sharing my experience with her. I guess she's the kind of teacher who likes to give tiring punishments? But then will the parents complain? I can imagine how kiddish and cute she is. By the way, how did you know her? Why don't you invite her to this forum cos I'm look forward to hear her experiences too.

              Actually no need to punish to kid one, 
              
              just say " you are so childish, sec 2 already still behave like kids, when you are going to grow up?" the kid will immediate stop his misbehavior. because no one like to be look down upon. 
              
              But the teachers are getting more and more unreasonable now a days.
