              <p>ya la, but i never stand properly mah.</p>
              <p>it wasnt that bad when you didnt take the punishment seriously.. i learned that once you dont think about the pain, it's not that bad (at least better than staying up all night to finish hw). HAHA but that was years ago.. now im a mugger <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
              <p>and it wasnt that embarassing coz i wasnt the only one who was punished mahh. i always have a friend to accompany me <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"> sometimes stand because of talking at class, my friend also kena mah <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              hi jesslyn1992,
              
              Oh so ur leg really feels tied standing on the chair? Perhaps that's the reason why u're punished to stand on chair instead of on the floor? Hehe.. I guess if the whole class or many people stand on chair, it isn't embarassing after all. I can't imagine gals wear skirt also must stand on chair. Hehe... I guess u'll hold on to the skirt while standing. :D

              during cny, one of my cousin shared wif me a case tat involved one of his frends from another class. tis cousin is the same one who shared abt his sch principal who would punish students harshly for various offences...i shared some of them in earlier posts...
              
              for tis case, his frend was taking a short nap while waiting for the teacher to come to class. unfortunately, the principal happened to walk pass his class n saw him dozing off on his desk. she ordered the student next to him to wake him up b4 ordering him to see her during recess time.
              
              it ended up tat my cousin's frend was made to miss recess tat day. the principal made him do punishment at a corner inside her office. she ordered him to stand wif his knees bent n his hands outstretched horizontally in front of him. he was given instructions to stay in tat position until she released him. the principal just proceeded wif her work, glancing at the student once in a while to ensure he didnt cheat on the punishment.
              
              in the end, my frend's cousin had to stay in tat position for the entire recess. my cousin estimated it to be no less than 20min. from wad he found out, his frend's hands n legs felt very tired after tat. it must be noted tat he stayed in tat position thru out. he didnt have any chance to cheat as the principal would check on him time n again. after he was released, the principal saw his reaction n said:"how was it? very tiring rite??? dun let me catch u dozing off in class again!!! if the teacher hasnt arrive, juz sit at ur desk n find sth to do. if catch u again, u will stand in my office for 1hr after school! N u will stand wif ur knees bent like wad u did juz now, do u hear me?? now go back to ur class!!!"
              
              my cousin then concluded by saying tat the punishment above is a very tiring one indeed. after all, he was punished in tat manner once by the same principal. hence he can understand the kind of tiredness his frend suffered. for me, i can imagine how hurting it must have been on the legs n hands even though i have nvr experienced it for myself...

              i dun tink the principal intended to embarrass him...rather her intention was to inflict physical tiredness n pain on the student...the reason y she punished him inside her office was so tat he would not be able to cheat on the punishment...punishments dun have to always be embarrassing, sometimes painful n tiring ones r equally harsh if not harsher...

              hi despondent,
              
              Oh I see. I guess you're right that the principal intended to make him feel tired and pain as punishment and not to embarrass him. I wonder what if the student is a girl, will the principal punish her in a similar way or will be more lenient?

              <p><br>It's a rather acceptable form of punishment for a boy at that age at least from my point of view. Though i must admit that it is really tiring. But i suppose that the principal would not have forced your cousin to carry on with the punishment if he really couldnt take it any longer.</p>

              Yeah, female teachers rarely use cane. Instead they think of creative punishments which are tiring. I guess it can be worse than caning in which the pain is for a few seconds only. Haha...

              Wow... its so hard to imagine that girls knee bend. Perhaps I guess girls have better endurance than boys because usually when they are punished, most of them will stand still throughout unlike boys will walk around after a short while.

              Hm... I did mentioned before here that during pri school days, some female teachers like to make students stand inside a small circle she drew on the floor. Since they cannot move their feet, their legs get tired easily. Haha... so cute. Other than that perhaps standing on chair or table quite common too.

              The circle is suppose to make sure the student stand still and cannot move about, thus making the legs tired easily. Raising up the arm is more tiring than standing still. Haha... it's a simple, cute and terribly tired punihsments. But then won't the floor gets dirty with all the circles? Will the teachers really make an effort to draw the circle if there are many students to punish? I guess once the teachers draw the circle, the student is expected to stand there for a long time. Haha...
