              Yeah, I think we discussed here before that females are more creative and like to give tiring punishments. Maybe because they doesn't like to cane so will think of such punishemnts instead. Hm.... I think stand at tiptoe position is not too bad but if the duration is too long then the poor students will feel the impact. Haha... but then is worse than standing on chair.

              <p>That is the reason why most of the punishments are created by female teachers. Not that it matters, as long as it is effective in bringing the point across to the students.</p>

              Haha, this punishment trains female students to wear heels and give male students a taste of how it is like to wear heels. I guess she probably put chalk powder on the floor so when the student drop back their feet, there will be foot prints.

              Haha... I find it rather far-fetched and unbelieving especially if its still happening now or recently. First of all, will she be that free to take note of how many times the students drop back onto their feet? By the way, how old is she? I bet she's a young girl in her 20s and her students must be lower primary kids? Hm... I guess I prefer to be tickled than to stand tiptoe. Haha.... guess she will do that to her bf too. Overall, I agree this punishment is harmless and very creative too. Why not introduce her to this forum?

              First of all, how did you know her? Wouldn't it be distracting to her and other students if she punished the naughty student to stand in front of the class? She has to teach and at the same time keep track of how many times they drop on their feet. Haha... her multitasking skill must be very good. Is she herself a playful girl as well cos I can't imagine anyone would be so creative to think of such punishment. You should introduce her to this thread cos I'm interested to hear her teaching experiences.

              Haha... the students probably already got used to the punishment so it will become ineffective. Why don't she think of new punishments like asking them to kneel and raise hands (the traditional korean punishment) but make the duration shorter?
