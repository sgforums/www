              <p>There was once when I entered a primary school to fetch my little cousin and I overheard a security guard who works at the school complaining to a parent about TEACHERS. The both of them were soooo engrossed in their bitching about teachers that they didn't even care I was there, listening the whole entire time.</p>
              <p>The security guard said something about a teacher talking on the phone with her boyfriend, making mushy, romantic talks and sounds. And when the security guard turn to stare at the teacher, she immediately ended her conversation with her boyfriend.</p>
              <p>The parent then said that her daughter's form teacher is very bias, often mistreating her daughter. The mother told the security guard that she quarreled with the teacher at the parents' meeting session, and the mother threatened to sue the teacher. </p>

            <div class='col-md body'>I chatted with one of my friend online just now who is teaching lower primary. She told me she moved away the table and chair of a naughty to the back of the classroom and punished him to sit on floor in the middle of the classroom. I asked her why she did not make him sit under the teacher's table instead and she said that will hurt his pride and she's very careful with punishments. Then I suggested to her about standing inside a small circle drawn on the floor and she said she can't do that bacause her school is not using chalk anymore. So I suggested drawing the circle on paper which she think is a good idea. She thanked me for it and said she will try it out next time and tell me the result. Haha ... how bad I am to suggest this punishment to her! :D</div>

              <p>well, in terms of pain, its a betta punishment than making the student sit on the floor in the middle of the classroom...the former was intended to shame the student rather than inflict pain anyway...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>what i have heard from modern day teachers like my frend is that they do have to be cautious wif punishments...its no longer like during our time where punishments were left to the teachers' discretion...nowadays, simple and common punishments of short duration are permitted but if the teacher wants sth more special and for longer durations, they may be required to justify their actions to higher authorities before/after giving out the punishments...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>hence, i dun tink ur frend would make the student stand inside the circle for very long cos she does have certain limitations in giving out punishments. Gone are the days when teachers may make students stand/kneel in the circle for durations as long as 1hr....counselling of students is gradually taking over...</p>

              This is a very good idea and I'm very sure she will not do that because she doesn't even want to make them stand outside classroom. Currently, she make them stand beside the rubbish bin for 30 mins or less. She agreed that standing inside small circle is cute and it will gives them restrictions. Best of all, it doesn't inflict any pain or harm. Haha ... I'm so eager to hear the results from her too!

              I can imagine last time the teachers really took the trouble to draw the circle each time they want to punish the student. They don't even mind doing that when they wore skirt and need to squat down to draw circle. Haha ...

              Yeah ... my feet were aching after I got home so I can imagine how your friend's students who were punished by her felt especially when they have to tiptoe throughout. Please remember to tell your friend about my experience and hopefully can intro me to her since she's so cute :)

                              <p>punishments are good to discipline naughty students. but too
              harsh defeats the main purpose either. bring in the ways they do in
              army. sit up, pumping etc. also better ways to "punish" them at the
              same time make their body more fitter. hehe. but seriously.
              nowadays the teachers are poor thingy. students misbehave, teacher
              can only watch helplessly. if they scold or do anything at all, the
              student go home bring parents to school complain teacher. in the
              end student get worse, parents complain teacher useless. sigh.
              although in the past scared of "punishments" and "canings", but i
              guess in the past disciplined students much more better than
              nowadays. now students can easily climb on top of their teachers'
              head and rip off their hair and wigs and laugh at the teacher and
              the teacher lan lan stand there try so hard not to cry in front of
              the students..</p>

              Hey Rosie, my friend also told me that. She punished her students to do sit-ups, push-ups etc when they never do the homework she gave them. She was only a tuition teacher then. If not, perhaps make them raise hands for 10 to 15 minutes is enough. Do you agree?

              <p>I keep on thinking why the chinese teacher react this way? No all students are bright and intelligent and good. Some are naughty too. Those kid needs guidance from the teacher. But seem that the teacher make them even more worst if the teacher dont bother them anymore.</p>

              Stand at attention for one and a half hrs is a good training for NDP parade participants. Hahaha ....he can't move his legs but can move upper body right? so its not as bad as NDP parade participants.
