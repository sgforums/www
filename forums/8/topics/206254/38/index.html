              blocking/unblocking acupoints. i dunno if there is basis for this
              but i remember watching in chinese martial arts dramas where there
              was an acupoint that once unblocked would cause the person to laugh
              and laugh uncontrollably non-stop until its blocked again...if this
              acupoint thingy is real and the teacher had the skill to unblock
              acupoints, i can imagine tat student laughing and laughing non-stop
              for a whole hr until the teacher blocked the acupoint again...</p>

              Haha ... this might not be true since its shown in drama. The teacher could have tickle tortured the student just like what your female teacher did. Those who didn't stand tiptoe will be tickled after class right?

              Wah what happens if the student can't stand and touch their toes like me? Hm ... half a period = 15 mins which is quite long too. I guess I won't be able to stand tiptoe for so long. hehe.... If I'm her student, I'll just beg her to let me stand normally for the whole lesson instead. :D

              Haha ... I will tell her that I'm not female so I'm not suppose to wear "imaginery heels". Maybe I'll ask her to change to stand and raise hands instead similar to the Korean punishment. At least for this punishment, can cheat by not having the arms straight. :D

              despondent,
              
              I guess her students should be surprised that she really think out of the box to come up with this punishment. Other teachers will usually use traditional punishments like stand on chair or stand outside clasroom. Haha ... I wonder if other teachers followed her idea.

              <p>i tink i replied u b4 that she has a very kiddish personality
              although she is matured in tinking...she was a science student in
              jc but she took humanities...then after A Levels, she went to NIE
              for her teaching degree...i guess she will be in this job for life
              cos she likes to mingle wif young kids...at least, it keeps her
              looking and behaving young always, she often says...</p>

              Yeah she's so interesting! A normal teacher will just punish the student to stand at a corner or outside classroom whereas she can think of such cute punishments and therefore she must be a very cute girl.That's why I'm so curious. It isn't surprising that she's single sinceteaching is female-dominated profession and there is less time for time to socialise.

              <p>i beg to differ...even though caning inflicts pain n shame, the pain dun last very long...but the pain inflicted from tis teacher's punishments last very long usually for the rest of the day. tis is more effective as the student will be reminded nt to repeat the offence.<br><br>anyway, the teacher has become the school's DM le. from wad i noe, she doesnt realli believe in caning...she stil trust more in the prolonged, painful n tiring punishments she often mete out in class. of cuz caning hasnt been abolished...juz tat its nt so frequently used anymore wif those harsh punishments as substitutes.<br><br>n those punishments have proven effective. students who played truant, caught smoking n caught fighting in sch have been dealt wif so severely tat hardly any in sch dared to do such things. there was an incident of 2 boys caught smoking outside sch. they were marched into the DM office. tis teacher made them kneel on marbles outside her office n carry their bags above their heads. on top of tat, they each had to hold 5 unlit cigarettes btw their lips thru out the punishment! guess how long they were punished??? for HALF A MORNING!!! from the time assembly ended at abt 745am until recess time at ard 10am! u can imagine the pain n suffering those 2 boys went thru...worse than being caned...<br><br>in fact, the teacher even made special arrangements tat day for all her classes during that punishment period to be held outside her office. so for tat 2 hrs or so, u could see classes going to the DM office to have their lessons outside. she did tis so tat she could keep an eye on the 2 boys. according to my frend, those 2 boys were nt given any rest at all. when his class had their lessons tat morning, those 2 boys were seen crying thru out. the onli thing the teacher did to ease their agony was to allow them to shift their arms occasionally. from lifting their bags abvoe their heads, she would change it to putting their bags on top of their outstretched arms. she would do tis every half hr. however, they were kept kneeling on the marbles thru out wif legs bent at 90 degrees....so isnt it true tat tis punishment acts as a better deterrent than caning?</p>

              <p>how old were they?which school?isnt kneeling on marbles damaging to the knee n forbidden?i never saw such things before.the part on standing outside the class with a bag over head i saw on a clip on tv by tcs ages ago...never seen it actually done</p>
              <p>there was one indian boy in my pri 6 class,hes always creating trouble for me,n once after flag lowering he suddenly kicked me down on the ground for nothing.i got up n gave chase but he ran away too fast,so i gave up n headed towards my dad,that was when i noticed my knees covered in blood,injured from the fall.i was so angry earlier i didnt even felt it!i reported this to my form teacher but all he did was tell the bastard to apologise to me the next day,n the apology wasnt even sincere,it was contrived.he shdve been punished like some of those stated here to feel the pain he inflicted on me.one bastard in army was similar,throwing juice at me n only got a warning from the plt commander,which he didnt even quite heed since he continued to try n taunt me.moral values are eroding severely these days.</p>
