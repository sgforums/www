            <div class='col-md body'>regarding tis teacher, my frend has seen it all. she was his form teacher for 2 yrs...thru out these 2 yrs, he has seen the gd n bad side of tis teacher...she can be very nice yet very nasty...<br><br>life as her form class can be rather tough... she has high expectations of her class...at the same time, she is also more rewarding towards them when they do gd...there was once when the class came up tops overall in cleanliness competition...the teacher took the whole class out for a treat on one of the wkends...she even taught them tat they shld maintain cleanliness at all times n to do it for their own gd nt cos theres reward waiting for them if they do it...<br><br>however, there were times when she was nasty towards them...there were occasions when the whole class was punished corporately for being bad...once she received a complaint from a relief teacher tat the class misbehaved in class n refused to keep quiet despite several warnings...furious, the teacher made the whole class stay back during recess the next day. they were all made to kneel next to their seats n carry their bags above their heads for the entire recess. then she made them go to the relief teacher n apologise to her individually after sch tat day...according to my frend, it was a tiring n painful punishment as the recess was half an hr long...moreover, the 1st lesson after recess was the teacher's...she ate into her own lesson time for a further 10-15min...so in total, the whole class was punished for abt 45min...some of the students were in tears while others were seemingly tired out from the punishment...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yew!!! ouch!!! i juz tried kneeling on marbles,,,man, its sheer pain man!!! cun imagine how the students managed to endure thru it all...wonder how it was like kneeling on marbles for half a morning...<br><br>anyway, i heard more abt tat teacher...during her younger days, she would wear stilettoes to sch...nt those super duper high ones but high enuff to raise eyebrows...her stilettoes were usually black n she would match tis wif typical office attire(dark-colored blazer / long sleeved blouse wif skirt or pants)...so students could hear her coming from afar from the sound made by her stilettoes...tis helped them out of trouble many times as they could hurriedly quieten down when they hear her coming...<br><br>in recent yrs, she doesnt wear those stilettoes anymore...nw she opt for less classy/elegant office shoes along wif smart office attire...tis spelt bad news for students as nw they cun hear her coming from afar...as a result, many have been caught misbehaving n severely punished...</div>
