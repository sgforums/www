            <div class='col-md body'>harlo!!! yupyup...for the old-timers in sgforums...u may find tis familiar...but i juz tot i will post tis in a diff. forum...<br><br>all of us i believe have had our fair share of being punished in school. some punishments r more physical while others more psychological...physical ones include caning, CWO, kneeling or standing for long periods etc...psychological ones like pulling of ears, facing the wall, being ask to sing in front of whole class etc...i personally feel tat diff. punishments shld vary wif the severity of offences n the age of the student involved...surely u wun wanna shame a university student by punishing him like a primary schoolboy?<br>below is a true account of a student i noe who was punished by a teacher...he was punished for spewing 1 word of vulgarity...<br><br>student: @#%()&amp;*&amp;^%$%^*<br>teacher: U!!! COME HERE!!! HOW DARE U SAY TAT!!! COME HERE!!!<br>boy approaches n teacher scolded: WAD DID U SAY JUZ NW?! I DARE U TO REPEAT WAD U SAID JUZ NW!!!<br>STUDENT: i didnt say anything...<br>teacher: DUN DENY IT ALRITE!!! I HEARD WAD U SAID!!! I HEARD U!!!(pulls student to 1 corner) SLAP URSELF!!! SLAP!!! KEEP ON SLAPPING!!<br>(abt 10 min later) teacher: U R NT SLAPPING...U R PATTING!!!(pulls student out of class) dun wanna slap rite...face the whole school n slap...<br>in the end, DM happen to walk pass...teacher complained abt student to him n student was caned in front of whole class...<br>after the caning...<br>teacher: COME HERE!!! (pulls student to one corner) STAND HERE N CONTINUE TO SLAP URSELF!!! I WANT SLAPS NT PATS!!! (student began to slap himself) U CALL TAT SLAPPING? HARDER!!! (student slaps harder) ALRITE!!! KEEP IT TAT WAY!!!<br><br>after abt 5min...<br>teacher(points finger at student): U R NT SLAPPING AGAIN!!! I TOLD U TO SLAP HARD RITE!!! HOW DARE U DISOBEY MY ORDERS!!! DO U WANT ANOTHER ROUND OF PUBLIC CANING??? (student began slapping himself hard again) MAKE SURE U KEEP TIS UP UNTIL I SAY U CAN STOP, ONE MORE TIME...N U WILL GET IT FROM ME!!! I WANT EVERY SLAP TO BE EQUALLY HARD, DO U UNDERSTAND???<br><br>in the end, student was made to slap himself for another 10-15 min...he had red cheeks after tat n had teary eyes...thru out the time, we could hear the slaps coming from his cheeks...the teacher kept an eye on him at regular intervals to ensure every slap was hard, she gave him no chance to slack at all...wad r ur views abt tis? was the teacher too harsh? was the student deserving of the punishment? air them here...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think detention is good enough. whats the use of punishing when the student doesn't see his mistakes.. more often then not, if the student is punished and made to lose face, chances are that he'll hate the teacher even more.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You have to understand that for a lot of students it is near impossible to control them if you don't punish then harshly in school. Kids nowadays are all spoilt brats and will not listen to you unless you can teach them to fear you.<br><br>Having said that there's a limit to how far they can go.............. going around kicking tables and chairs is obviously too much.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>to nonameguy<br><br>but u also must understand the kind of punishment the teacher meted out...she was dealing a psychological n physical punishment at the same time...<br>psychological: shaming the student wif the slapping in front of whole class...<br>physical: the pain inflicted from the slaps...<br><br>from the case, we can see tat the teacher was expecting proper slaps from the student...imagine slapping hard for 10min? tats y i said it was harsh...but appropriate also cos of the nature of the offence...vulgarities came out from mouth so mouth deserve to be punished...slapping...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the teacher in this case is not doing the right thing. He should've talked nicely to the student and find out what's the cause of the outburst, and explained to him rationallly and calmly why it's wrong to use vulgarities. If the student is recalcitrant then he should be referred to the OM or the DM. The actions of the teacher in this case are too confrontational. It doesn't help anyone one bit.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>IMO the teacher is just being silly.<br><br>Dun tell me the teacher doesn't use the F word or any other vulgaritites in his/her whole life b4. Its part and parcel of life every1 goes tru. punishing student for scolding vulgarities are simply nonsense.<br><br>She could have just made it clear to the class that she doesnt mind students scolding vulgarities but not in her class when she's around to hear them.<br><br>this way she gains students repect which boost up her popularity lvl in school among students too. keep in mind no matter which era u are in. students will always be students. they are rebellious in a way or another. its how u mix with them to make them respect u, and punishment is definately not the way to win their trust.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There is this fucked up teacher that taught me before, i wont go through the details about why hes fucked up.But even i heard my ex-POA teacher saying "Siao da bor" softly to herself when she saw him acting strange.<br><br>He kept issuing threats to this one in a sec 4 class, e.g.i wont give you your testimonial blah blah blah and always pick on him for no reason.Then one day he said"I will not issue you your testimonial."Then he said"What did i do."Then the teacher accused him of being rude and asked the class to be a witness.The boy got dulan and stabbed him on the shoulder with a pen and the teacher retaliated by punching him in the mouth.AIya long story..<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;"><br>I dun understand why students are expecting teachers to go soft on them these days when they are becoming more wild and disrespectful...  I suggest the students who complain so much about their teachers to go n reflect on their own behaviour first b4 even making any comments...<br><br>IMO, I agree that teachers should only resort to physical punishments as the last alternative... but going by how unruly students can be these days, i also think that it is most unfair to ask a teacher to back down and talk "nicely"...<br><br>students are forever demanding to be understood.. but take a moment to ask urselves.. hv u ever put urself in the teacher's position? how would u like to have someone toking back to you or shouting vulgarities?  would YOU be able to tolerate it??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br></span></div>
