              Wow ... perhaps should just make them stand outside staff room and
              pull ears during recess. That will make them feel embarassed
              especially for a female sec 4 student and they will not dare to be
              late again right? How will you punish them instead if u're the
              principal?</p>

              Nope. not in my pri and sec school. In sec school, my teachers like to make people stand under a palm tree surrounded by pebbles outside the staff room and they become the centre of attraction. Haha...

              Thanks despondant for posting such a wondeful video. Is that show currently showing on channel 8 every Saturday from 3 to 5 pm? I love korean movies and I'm going to watch it.
              
              I think they were pre-university students around 18 yrs old and they don't seem to be that mischievous after all. Hm... the 3 of them were caught talking during lesson in the science lab and were ordered by the teacher to stand with hands up. While walking to the corner, the girl can be seen adjusting her blouse and pulling up her skirt. I guess she knows her skirt probably get loose after raising up her hands. The girl and the other boy can also been seen cheating in the punishment by not raising their hands straight. The girl had even held her palms together as if she was doing stretching exercise to make it less tiring unlike her bf whose hands are raised straight up. Even when they were punished to kneel outside the lab, the girl's hands are titled downwards at an angle while her bf's hands straight up.
              
              Isn't this punishment similar to the one you experienced in pri 3, despondant? Do you all cheat in the punishment like what the girl did? It seems that usually girls are allowed to cheat a little in the punishment. Haha... after all, it seemed so sweet for couples to be punished together. I wouldn't mind being punished if I'm that lucky guy as it seemed that they were not tired throughout the punishment. Just like when they were outside the lab, they could even chat happily with each other. :D

              Oh never mind. I can watch the movie in youtube instead. But in the show, the couple doesn't seem to get tired, probably because the punishment have just started. I guess since they could cheat in the punishment like what the girl did. In fact, they seemed to enjoy the punishment because they could chat with each other.
              
              Anyway, here's a short video clip I've found about 2 pretty Korean schoolgirls being asked to sit outside classroom with their desks and chairs. They kept talking to each other until the teacher came out to scold them. They tried to "sa jiao" and ended up being punished to kneel on their table with hands raised up. Despite that, they continued talking and beating each other until the teacher came out to scream at them. Haha...

              What do you mean by background of the punishment? This is actually an extract from a popular Korean drama. The bad point is that it has no English subtitles. It's interesting to see the 2 gals "sa jiao" before getting punished to kneel and raise hands. I will probbaly get my online Korean friends to translate if possible and find the remaining video clip since I'm interested to know what happened to the 2 gals after they were being caught again by the teacher for beating each other while raising hands. Haha... seems like most Korean teachers are young handsome males.

              Yeah the punishments should not be too harsh for them. How about using your friend's method of making them stand tip-toe for the whole lesson? I guess they won't feel that tired if they wear high-heels often. Haha...

              Yeah I really like her punishment because its so unique and she really thinks out of the box. Actually the 2 gals can still put down their hands because their teachers can't see them from inside the classroom. Only when they make a lot of noise then their teacher will come out. Haha! hm... your friend can use chalk to draw a shaded circle and make her student stand tip-toe inside the circle. If the student let down his heels or tries to move about, there will be markings on the circle. Alternatively, can make the student wear her high-heels but on a longer duration. In this way, the student will still suffer from tiredness just like what females experience when wearing heels for a long time. Haha...
