            <div class='col-md body'>i recall a case way back in pri 1...i was walking to the canteen for recess wif another of my classmate...on the way, we past by the teacher's room...we were chitting chatting along the way when my classmate said sth tat was undesirable...i cun remember wad it was, all i noe was tat it was a crude word...well, unfortunately the form teacher of the class next to ours heard it as she entered the teacher's room...she ordered my frend to a corner n then scolded him for wad he said...<br><br>i was a gd 2metres away from my frend n the teacher then so i couldnt realli hear wad the teacher was telling my frend...all i knew was tat after some scolding, i saw my frend slapping both his cheeks...then i saw the teacher pointing her finger at him saying: hit until i tell u to stop, OK? she then proceeded into the teacher's room...<br><br>in the end, my frend had to spend the entire recess slapping his cheeks...the gd thing for him was tat the teacher was in the teacher's room most of the time so he could 'cheat' on the punishment by patting his cheeks instead of slapping...stil, my frend felt tired out as he had to stand thru out the recess n suffer the embarrassment of students walking past n giggling at him...moreover according to him, the teacher did come out from the teacher's room twice...once to get a drink, another to go to the toilet...on both occasions, the teacher would go up to him n order him to slap harder...my frend would do so until she went back into the teacher's room...<br><br>in the end the teacher onli released him when the sch bell rang signalling end of recess...it was indeed a harsh punishment considering we were onli in pri 1 then...i believe though tat the teacher nvr intended to punish my frend until he cried...she onli wanted to make him feel ashamed n to inflict a little discomfort n pain from the punishment...hoping tat the experience will deter him from future usage of crude words...tats y she punished him outside the teacher's room instead of inside...<br><br>i believe the teacher knew tat my frend 'cheated' on the punishment but chose to turn a blind eye to it as long as he kept up the 'rite' actions...which was to hit his cheeks wif his hands although softly...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the teacher i mentioned above is unique in tat she doesnt raise her voice at all...even when she scolds, she scolds in her normal tone...u may tink tat wads so scary abt such a teacher. well she is someone who doesnt raise her voice but yet punished students quite a lot...being next to her class, i witnessed her students being punished by her many times...<br><br>it was common to see students being punished outside the classroom...during tat yr, i saw students being made to stand outside the class n pull their ears...there were some who were made to stand outside wif mouths taped up...some were made to stand outside wif hands raised straight up...<br><br>these punishments were meted out cos students were found nt bringing their bks, toking in class or nt having done their hmwork...the teacher was considered quite strict by our standards but her punishments usually didnt last for very long durations n students usually dun end up crying from the punishments...<br><br>there was one case which i remembered quite vividly...will post it next...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hello again...yup here is wad happened...<br><br>it was rite after morning assembly n we had all returned to our classes...abt 5min into our 1st lesson, i saw 2 boys from the next class walking out to the corridor wif the teacher behind them...i was seated near the door of my class so i had a gd view of wad happened though i couldnt realli hear wad the teacher said...<br><br>the 2 boys were asked to stand next to each other in front of the teacher...she then proceeded to scold them...from the few barely audible words i heard, it appeared tat the boys were playing a fool n nt paying attention in class...after some scolding, the teacher ordered both of them to pull their ears while standing in the middle of the corridor...<br><br>abt 10 min later, more was to come...1st i muz say tat these 2 boys didnt appear repentant at all...during the 10min, they were whispering to each other n grinning occasionally...i saw the teacher approaching them wif sth in her hand...it was a roll of scotchtape...she went up to the boys, smacked them on their shoulders, scolded them for toking during punishment n then taped their mouths up wif scotchtape...it was a rather interesting sight...from where i was, i noticed tat the teacher gagged their mouths wif a few layers of scotchtape. u could see she was very angry from her face as she added layer after layer of scotchtape on their mouths until she felt it was strong enuff to stop them from toking...<br><br>b4 she went back to class, the teacher separated the 2 boys n ordered them to do half-squats continuously until she say they can stop...in the end, the 2 boys spent abt half a period pulling their ears n doing half-squats...tat was stil nt the end, to make sure they learnt their lesson, the teacher ordered tat the scotchtape remain on their mouths until recess time...the 2 boys sure had an unpleasant time...<br><br>so do u forumites tink the punishment was too harsh or do u tink it was appropriate n deserving?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When my children were in Primary/Secondary schools, I made it a point to go to their schools and got to know who their class teachers are. I introduced myself and in the presence of my children, I gave authority to the class teachers to discipline my children if they got out of hand. I gave the teachers my contact numbers. My children heard what I said and they understood I meant what I said.<br><br>Except for minor pranks, my children were never publicly punished in schools. I respected the teachers and the teachers respected me. My children can't hoodwink me about not doing homework, being disrespectful, etc as they know their teachers and me kept in close contact.<br><br>Indirectly I believe my childrens' teachers were less harsh with my children because the teachers felt I understood the frustrations they had in dealing with naughty children whose parents don't care or were quick to blame the teachers.<br><br>I feel parents and teachers should establish an open channel for communication regarding their children/students. Unfortunately, except for those parents who are involved in Parents/Teachers' Associations, most parents no hiew about their children in school.... even worst are those parents who think their children are angels.....hiazz.......<br><br>I don't know how it is nowadays because my children are now adults so maybe things are very different now...</div>
