            <div class='col-md body'>i dun tink it would help...after all, the teacher didnt abuse her authority...moreover, she did nt punish the student abusively...she let the student rest his hands after seeing him in tears...besides, the student was known as the troublemaker back then...the teacher gave a very harsh punishment but i dun tink it was overdone...u muz note tat lighter punishments were given previously but the student was stil unrepentant...<br><br>i personally feel the student deserved the punishment though i cun imagine myself going thru it...i believe i would have had a horrid time too...being a primary 1 kid then...at least the teacher was humane, she would nt punish students beyond their level of endurance...tis is unlike the earlier teacher who taught my frend...she made unrepentant students do punishments until they cried terribly in pain...her punishments could go beyond the students' level of endurance b4 she finally let them off...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i rem we were very fearful of tis teacher back then...yet i muz say tat she is actually rather nice as long as we didnt misbehave in class or commit any 'classroom' offences...the reason y we were fearful of her was the way she dealt wif us when we do wrong...she was very strict whenever punishments were meted out n she was known for honouring wad she said...for eg. if she had threatened to prolong the punishment if she caught the student 'cheating' on the punishment, she would realli do it if the student 'cheated'...due to tis, hardly any of us dared to 'cheat' when we were being punished...there were cases when students had to go thru prolonged or harsher punishments cos they took her warning for granted....hence it explains y the student in the above case kept his hands straight up for 1 entire period without 'cheating'...he was probably afraid tat the teacher would send him to the DM office if he 'cheated'.<br><br>as hardly any of us dared to 'cheat', we often ended up suffering the fullest extent of the punishment...fortunately for us, the teacher was humane, she wouldnt punish us abusively to the pt where we cry out in extreme pain n tiredness...the furthest she ever went was to punish students until tears could be seen forming in their eyes...even then, such cases were rare n onli happened to repeated n serious offences...most of the time, her aim was juz to either make us feel very embarrassed from the punishments or to inflict a certain level of discomfort/pain to deter us from repeating the offences...below is an account of a classmate of mine who had to go thru a prolonged n harsher punishment cos he refused to heed the teacher's warnings...<br><br>a student was being punished for not doing his hmwork...he was ordered to stand at a corner in front of the class n hold his bk up wif both hands...he was given orders nt to lean against the wall n to stand properly wif both his hands straight up...<br><br>barely few minutes later, student was caught leaning on one leg n resting slightly against the wall...<br>teacher: ah lim!!! y r u leaning against the wall n standing on one leg? take 2 steps forward n stand properly!!! y r ur elbows bent? didnt i tell u to keep them straight up??? (ah lim shifted his position, straightening his hands) dun let me catch u slacking again or i wil punish u more severely!!!<br><br>abt 10min later, teacher took a glance at ah lim...ah lim was slacking again, his elbows were slightly bent, he was standing on one leg...<br><br>teacher: didnt i make myself clear juz nw??? how dare u disobey my orders!!! (walked towards ah lim...teacher raised her voice) TURN N FACE THE CLASS!!! SINCE U CUN STAND PROPERLY, U SHALL DO SOME EXERCISE INSTEAD!!! (takes a pile of bks she had marked n put them in ah lim's hands) HOLD THEM ABOVE UR HEAD, KEEP UR ARMS STRAIGHT UP!!! SINCE U CUN HOLD A BK PROPERLY, U SHALL CARRY A PILE OF BKS THEN!!!(smacks ah lim on his thighs) START DOING HALF-SQUATS, KEEP DOING UNTIL I SAY U CAN STOP!!! (ah lim obliged)TIS IS MY FINAL WARNING TO U, DUN U DARE DISOBEY MY ORDERS!!! I WANT TO SEE U DOING TIS PROPERLY, DO U UNDERSTAND???<br><br>abt 5min later. teacher spotted ah lim slacking...his elbows were bent n his half-squats were sloppily done...<br>teacher(very angry): Y R UR ELBOWS BENT N Y R U NT HALF-SQUATTING PROPERLY!!! U R REALLI VERY BOLD TO DEFY MY ORDERS TIME N AGAIN!!! (pulls ah lim away from the corner) COME N STAND NEXT TO MY TABLE...(grabs another pile of bks n added to the existing pile) HOLD THEM UP ABOVE UR HEAD!!! (smacks ah lim's legs) BEND BOTH UR LEGS DOWN!!! (ah lim obliged, bending his legs lower) ALRITE, KEEP THEM BENT AT TIS ANGLE...U WIL STAY IN TIS POSITION FOR THE REST OF TIS LESSON!!!I WIL BE WATCHING U CLOSELY, IF U DARE DEFY MY ODERS AGAIN, I WIL SEND U TO THE DM, IS TAT CLEAR??? NW KEEP BOTH UR ARMS STRAIGHT UP N NO LEANING AGAINST ANYTHING!!!<br><br>in the end, ah lim was punished in tat manner for the rest of the lesson...he had teary eyes after tat...it was obviously tiring having to hold up a pile of bks above his head while doing half-squats n keeping his knees bent for abt half a period...the teacher sat at her table marking bks while the rest of us did our work...she would glance at ah lim once in a while to ensure he wasnt slacking in any way..u could see the agony from ah lim's face...it was obvious he was suffering badly n desired very much to rest, but the teacher kept him at it until the bell rang at the end of the lesson...it was indeed a very horrid experience for ah lim n a very stern warning to the rest of us nt to ignore the teacher's warnings...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thru one of my frends, i got to noe a guy who was taught by tis teacher when he was in primary 4...tat was 1yr after i graduated from primary sch...according to him, he was a rather naughty boy back then...he n his 2 other frends often got punished by tis teacher...she was his form teacher tat yr...during tat yr, he was given almost all the possible punishments u could tink of in sch...in fact, it was so bad tat his parents was called to see the principal n he was even caned for serious offences...<br><br>according to him, tis teacher is less forgiving wif the upper primary students...during the yr she taught me, she would forgive us some times when we misbehave in class or forgot our bks/hmwork...she probably did tat cos she considered we were onli in primary one...also it appears tat the punishments given to upper primary students were harsher...there were times when students were made to kneel along the corridor n pull their ears cos they misbehaved in class...other times, students could be found facing the wall while standing outside the teacher's room after sch hrs for durations of no less than 2 hrs!!! the students would report to the teacher once lessons was done for the day n they would be made to stand along the corridor outside the teacher's room...they were made to stand wif their legs tgr n given orders not to lean on one leg or against the wall...<br><br>according to tis acquaintance of mine, he was made to stand outside the teacher's room after sch for no less than 4 occasions...according to him, tis punishment was realli tiring...students would be dismissed from sch at 1255pm daily...students who were being punished would be required to report at the teacher's room by 1pm...for him, he was made to stand until almost 3pm the 1st time...his legs were aching badly yet he foolishly refused to repent...subsequently, the durations got longer n longer...by the time his parents were summoned to sch, he had alredi been made to stand facing the wall for more than 3hrs!!! acording to him, his legs realli hurt each time...the teacher would not show any leniency at all, he would be made to stand properly wif both legs tgr for the ENTIRE duration!!! he recalled 2 incidents when the teacher gave him extra punishment for not standing properly...they happened at the time when he had been standing for more than 2 hrs n his legs felt tired...hence, he started to stand on one leg so as to allow his legs some rest...<br><br>as he recalls, the teacher was not an unreasonable person...she would give him initial warnings when she caught him nt standing properly...however, for those 2 incidents, he chose to ignore the teacher's warnings, opting to 'cheat' on the punishment despite initial warnings...needless to say, the teacher was angry wif him for nt heeding her warnings...she walked up to him both times n said sth like tis: i see u like standing wif ur legs bent, rite? well, u shall stand wif ur legs bent then! squat down halfway n keep ur legs bent at ard 45 degrees!!! u wil keep ur legs bent until i say so, if i catch ur legs nt bent, u wil get it from me!!! so in the end, he had to suffer a worse punishment than b4...the teacher would usually make him knee-bend for ard 15-20min b4 allowing him to resume normal standing...by then his legs would alredi be very tired...yet the teacher would nt let him off until he had been punished for at least 2hrs...<br><br>i am relieved in a way tat the teacher didnt do tis to us when we were in primary one...she probably felt tat primary one students were too young to go thru such punishments...instead she opted for punishments tat brought forth shame rather than pain...its was onli for serious/repeated offences tat she would mete out punishments tat brought forth physical pain to us...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>tis teacher mentioned above was very strict in the sense tat she expect all punishments to be done properly wif no slacking...students who were punished were expected to adhere to all the requirements she set at all times...for eg, students who were made to stand were expected to stand without leaning against anything, wif both legs tgr n no standing on one leg...when stuents were made to lift their bks above their heads, they were expectd to keep both their hands straight up at all times...the teacher would nt allow them to bend their elbows even a little bit...for ear-pulling, teacher expected ears to be pulled n nt the students juz holding on to their ears wif their fingers...even for the case involving myself where we were made to do half-squats wif our ears pulled in a criss-cross manner, she expected us to pull our ears hard n to squat down completely b4 coming up, repeating tis action again n again until she was satisfied...it was no wonder all of us were so tired after everything...<br><br>from a case i mentioned earlier in tis thread, my frend was made to slap himself for the entire recess cos he spoke a crude word which was heard by tis teacher..from the account, we can see tat for slapping punishments, teacher expected proper slaps n she also expected my frend to stand properly...tat was y his legs felt a little tired at the end of recess n his cheeks also hurt from all the slapping though he didnt end up in tears...<br><br>but nw when i tink back, its rather clear y the teacher was so strict wif her punishments...she wanted us to learn from our mistakes in a very harsh way so tat we wun  repeat them again...for my frend, he didnt dare use crude words after tat for a long time...it was onli much later in life tat he went back to his old self...as for me, i can nvr forget the experience of pulling my ears in a criss-cross manner n doing half-squats non-stop for more than 15min...</div>

They are there 2 provide a service, and cannot do anything when their customers are unreasonable. They cannot lay a finger on them, or else the kids will ask their parents come school make a scene.

(teacher proceeds to the toilet)<br><br>(abt 5min later, teacher came back from the toilet)<br>teacher(looked at my frend, who was slapping himself quite hard): make sure u remember wad i juz told u!!! dun let me catch u nt slapping urself properly...n y r u standing on one leg??? stand properly!!! if u like standing on one leg so much, i wil make u stand n hop on one leg for the rest of tis wk!!! as punishment for disobeying my orders, u wil keep on slapping urself until the end of recess!!<br><br>In the end, my frend spent abt 15min slapping properly n onli abt 10min 'cheating'...as my frend recalls, he hated tat teacher after tat cos she made him feel so ashamed, letting other students see him being punished...moreover, he was onli a primary 1 kid...my frend felt the teacher punished him too harshly...he wouldnt mind being ask to slap himself but to do tat for the ENTIRE recess n wif proper slaps expected, it was nt deserving for a primary 1 kid, who was a 1st time offender...nonetheless, tat was abt 20yrs ago...nw my frend can onli look back laugh it off...<br></blockquote>wif relation to the above case, i mentioned tat the punishment did have an impact on my frend as he did stop using crude words for a period of time...however, few yrs later when we were in upper primary, my frend was again punished for using crude words, tis time in class..coincidentally, it was in tat teacher's class...i rem she taught us social studies tat yr...it was in the midst of the lesson, we were doing our work when my frend whispered sth crude to his neighbour..unfortunately for him, the teacher heard wad he said n ordered him to report to her after sch...wad was even worse was tat the teacher rem tat she had punished him b4 for the same offence few yrs back...below is an account of wad happened...again i muz state tat the words r made up but the context is similar to the actual event...<br><br>(students were doing their work)<br>G(whispered to neighbour): hey where u wanna go after sch??? (neighbour kept quiet, puts finger on his lips telling G to keep quiet)<br>G(got impatient at neighbour, whispered): u b****y i***t!!! answer me can or not, f**k!!!<br><br>teacher(heard wad G said n looked up sternly): who said those words?? own up nw!!! (class kept silence)<br>teacher(angrily): whoever said tat betta own up nw or the whole class wil be punished!!! (neighbour looked at G, gesturing him to own up..G raised his hands)<br>teacher: stand up!!! was there any necessity to say those words?? (G kept quiet, head lowered) do u stil rem wad u promised me when u were in pri 1?? u promised u wun use crude words ever again...didnt u??? (G nodded) do u also rem wad i said would be ur punishment if i catch u using crude words again??? (G nodded) very well, u shall report to me after sch today, nw sit down n do ur work quietly!!!<br><br>after sch tat day, G reported at the teacher's room...<br>teacher: follow me!!!<br>(minutes later, they arrived at the sch entrance, there were many students there on their way hm)<br>teacher(pointed to 1 corner of the schgate): stand here n slap urself!!! u wil face the school n slap urself for the next hr!!!<br>G(burst out crying): mdm, pls give me another chance...i am very sorry...<br>teacher: i am nt going to let u off tis time...u wil do as i told u, nw stand here n slap urself!!!<br>G(sobbing hard): mdm pls, i beg u...u can punish me in other ways but pls dun make me do tis in front of whole sch...<br>teacher: tis is my final warning to u, do u hear me??? if u use crude words again, i wil make sure u slap urself in front of the whole sch!!! nw come me!!<br><br>minutes later, they arrived outside the teacher's room...<br>teacher: stand here, in the middle of the corridor n slap urself!!! (G obliged) u noe wad i expect, slap urself properly!!! for the next 1 hr, i expect to see u slapping hard n no standing on one leg!!! dun u dare take a break when i am nt looking!!! if u defy my orders, i wil make u do tis in front of the whole sch, do u hear me??? (G nodded)<br><br>it was a terrible experience for my frend...he ended up wif tired hands n legs, along wif painful cheeks...the teacher did spotchecks on him once in a while by looking out of the teacher's room...my frend didnt dare to 'cheat' at all as he was afraid of having to do punishment in front of whole sch if he did...hence, he slapped himself hard for the ENTIRE hr, having to suffer the embarrassment of students giggling at him as they walked past...the teacher kept him at it for a WHOLE HR b4 she finally released him...it was certainly an unforgettable incident for my frend n until today he stil remembers tat fateful day which he considers as his worst day in his school life...it was the onli time he was punished in such a manner for such a long duration...<br></div>
