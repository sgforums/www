              during my sch days, i had a tutor who tutored me mandarin from secondary 1 to secondary 4. it was a small group of 3 students...there were my primary sch classmate, his younger bro n myself. the tutor herself was a primary sch teacher n our lessons were usually held at my frend's place at 730pm, twice a wk...tis tutor was somewhere ard her late forties/early fifties n she was known to be quite strict wif her students...she was very particular abt homework n would get very edgy when students dun do their work...yet being onli our tutor n nt our sch teacher, she was somewad more lenient towards us, although she stil expected a certain amt of discipline n commitment from us...
              
              i recall a particular case tat happened when i was in sec2...tat was the yr when my frend's bro was in pri 6, which was his PSLE yr...it was during one particular tuition class...1st i must state tat it was a regular practice of our tutor to start the lesson by going thru our homework n also to give us spelling tests...for tat lesson, it was no different...since it was PSLE yr, the tutor focused alot on my frend's bro's spelling n he was given spelling tests almost every lesson...
              
              on tat fateful day, the tutor came n began the lesson by checking n marking our homework...after going thru our homework wif us, she then proceeded wif the spelling test while leaving my frend n i wif sth to read up on...it turned out tat my frend's bro didnt study for his spelling test again...wad infuriated the tutor was tat tis spelling test was alredi overdue. it was supposed to be given the previous lesson but was delayed cos my frend's bro didnt study it...the tutor was gracious enuff to give him a chance n delayed the test...however, tis time she was realli furious!! she scolded him for being lazy n said tat if he is going to carry on like tat, his PSLE results wil be affected.
              
              after several minutes of scolding, our tutor decided tat he had to be punished. hence, she ordered him to push in his chair n stand at a corner near the table...he was made to stand wif both his legs tgr n ordered to study his spelling. it wasnt a surprise the tutor punished him as we have been punished by her b4...however, wad was shocking was the manner in which he was punished...the tutor was very harsh wif him thru out...she didnt allow him to lean against anything or put his hand on the table...on top of tat, she would scold him each time he stood on one leg...wad was unexpected to my frend n i was tat she made him stand for the entire lesson!!! tis was the 1st time she punished any of us in such a harsh manner as the punishment in tis case lasted abt one n a half hrs!!! my frend's bro juz stood n studied his spelling for the whole lesson. it was obvious from his reaction tat his legs were very tired n tis could be seen by he bending his legs nw n then. we knew the tutor was aware of tis but she ignored him n continued wif our lesson. my frend n i felt sorry for him but there was nth we could do as our tutor turned away our pleas...
              
              when he was finally released at the end of the lesson, u could see the relief on my frend's bro's face. our tutor sternly instructed him to make sure he is prepared for his spelling test at the next lesson...he was given a double set of spelling words to study n our tutor warned tat if he comes unprepared the next lesson, she will make him stand n hold up his spelling bk above his head for the entire lesson!!! i feel tat our tutor punishing him so harshly tat time was deliberate. yet i noe she meant well...she wanted him to do well at his PSLE n hence saw the need to punish him harshly so tat he will stop being lazy abt his spelling...well, in the end she didnt have to punish him a 2nd time...my frend's bro sure learnt from tat painful punishment after tat...

              wif regards to the case above, i recall tat after more than midway thru the class, my tutor said she needed to go to the washroom. as she stood up to go to the toilet, she turned n sternly instructed my frend's bro nt to slack while she was away n to stand properly...by tat time, it was obvious from his facial expression tat his legs were hurting him...he had been standing for abt an hr n complained to us, when the tutor was away, tat his legs were so tired tat he couldnt stand properly much longer...
              
              i recall how my frend tried to plead wif our tutor to let his bro off...however, our tutor was adamant n told us to concentrate on our work...it seemed to us tat she was aware tat my frend's bro was suffering badly from the punishment as she allowed him to stand wif his legs slightly apart after she came back from the toilet...however, he was stil nt allowed to stand on one leg n continued to stand until the end of the lesson...it was a very painful experience for my frend's bro n he did learn from it...
              
              in my next post, i will relate the aftermath of tis incident which started wif my tutor showing some concern abt an hr after class if his legs were still painful...meanwhile, maybe u would like to comment if my tutor was too harsh in punishing my frend's bro in tis case...

              some things i wanna add b4 sharing abt the aftermath of the incident above...the 3 of us were rather shocked tat time by wad my tutor did to my frend's bro. none of us expected her to punish him so harshly even though she had meted out punishments b4...to us, the punishment was rather harsh n even our tutor admitted tat(will share more abt tis). the pain my frend's bro suffered from prolonged standing was unforgettable to us...
              
              for myself, i was also punished in a similar way once. however, the suffering i went thru was much less..i was in sec 1 tat yr...we juz had a spelling test which i failed...our tutor scolded me for doing badly n asked if i studied at all...when she saw the guilt on my face, she got angry n chided me for being lazy...in the end, i was told to push in my chair n stand at a corner next to the table. i was punished in the exact manner as my frend's bro n ordered to study my spelling...
              
              i was let off after abt half an hr...the tutor decided to postpone my spelling to the next lesson but i had to prepare 2 sets of spelling words...the lesson went on as normal after tat...i can stil remember tat my legs did feel a little tired at the end of half hr. hence i can understand how my frend's bro must have felt from standing for one n a half hrs...it must be stated tat our tutor made us stand wif our legs tgr n we were nt allowed to stand on one leg at all...standing in such a manner can be very tiring on the long run which was clearly seen from my frend's bro's case...

              ok as promised, here is the aftermathof the incident mentioned above...the lesson ended as usual at ard 915pm. after lesson, i stayed at my frend's place to catch a tv program b4 going hm. abt an hr later, the phone rang. it was my tutor. she had reached hm n asked to speak to my frend's bro. it turned out tat our tutor had called to ask if his legs were still painful from the prolonged standing. my frend's bro replied saying tat his legs were stil hurting n feeling tired. after exchanging a few more words, they hung up...my tutor advised my frend's bro to massage his legs so as to ease the pain...
              
              at the next lesson, our tutor brought up the matter again. tis time she asked out of concern how long the pain lasted. my frend's bro replied tat his legs were stil aching a little when he woke up the following morning. when she heard tis, our tutor looked slightly shocked. she was probably shocked at how bad an impact the punishment had on my frend's bro. she then replied saying she hoped he had learnt his lesson n tat she would nt have to punish him so harshly again. from tis, she  began to share wif us some experiences she had wif her students n how she dealt wif them...tis i wil share in my next post...

              ok...as promised tis was wad our tutor shared wif us...
              
              our tutor shared tat since she was young she had been a firm believer tat it is every teacher's responsibility to ensure students r well-guided n taught. hence, as a sch teacher n private tutor, it was her responsibility to ensure tat she taught us well nt onli academically but also socially whenever possible...
              
              regarding punishments, she shared tat she was a believer tat punishments shld be harsh. however, she was quick to add tat punishments shld nt be abused. tis meant tat teachers shld nt be punishing students excessively. punishments shld onli be used when its called for. wad was arousing to us was the fact tat my frend's bro was nt the onli one who was punished in such a manner b4. our tutor shared tat she had students who were also made to stand for the entire lesson, lasting over an hr, for similar offences. hardly any of them could go thru the punishment without having legs tat were utterly tired out n painful. however, she noted tat such cases were rare. usually, she would resort to punishments tat were less painful like giving the students extra hmwork, making them write lines etc...
              
              our tutor also shared tat punishments had to be harsh cos they r meant to discipline n teach the students. she argued tat there was no pt meteing out light punishments as students will not learn from it. she shared tat there had been occasions when she had to cane students on their palms although tis usually happened to unrepentant n hard core students. for tis, she would inform the parents abt the caning. such a punishment was usually limited to males n those in primary school...for older students, she would resort to some of the punishments mentioned above...our tutor ended off by telling us tat she was nt one who enjoyed punishing students. in fact, she would love to have students who need nt be punished at all...her punishments may be harsh i feel, but yet justifiable...

              for one period at the most. moreover, she usually resorted to
              punishments onli when it was a repeated offence...<br>
              <br>
              however, i remember a case tat yr when she punished a student for
              the entire 2 periods...he was a repeated offender. moreover, he
              made things worse by disobeying her orders and slacking when doing
              punishment. the teacher came into class tat day n told us to hand
              in our hmwork...this student was found nt to have done his hmwork
              again...previously, the teacher had let him off lightly...the 1st
              time he was given a warning n his name was recorded down. the 2nd
              time, he was made to stand n pull his ears in front of the class
              for nearly one period. for tis case, the teacher was realli furious
              n scolded him quite badly. tis time she sent him out of the
              class...he was asked to stand in the middle of the corridor and
              pull his ears...<br>
              <br>
              abt halfway thru the 1st period, the teacher saw the student
              slacking...he was standing on one leg n he was merely holding on to
              both his ears wif onli 2 fingers...infuriated, the teacher went out
              of the class...she scolded him for slacking n ordered him to stand
              properly...initially she ordered him to pull his ears harder but
              then changed her mind...she ordered him to raise up both his hands
              and to keep them straight up...after giving a final warning nt to
              slack, the teacher went back into the classroom...<br>
              <br>
              in the end, the student had to keep his hands raised for abt half
              an hr!!! in fact, the teacher would have kept him at it until end
              of lesson if he had nt shown signs of weariness n pain. moreover,
              the teacher onli allow him to put his hands down after he promised
              to pull his ears properly...so in the end, the student spent abt
              the last 15min standing outside the class n pulling his ears
              hard...he was let off onli at the end of the lesson...on top of
              tat, the teacher made him stay back after sch to complete his
              hmwork...he was made stand at his table n do his hmwork...<br>
              <br>
              tat was the onli cae tat yr tat the teacher showed her true
              colours...but i felt the student deserved it though i feel the
              punishment was rather harsh...yet, given his rebellion n
              disobedience, such a punishment was needed to teach him a
              lesson...</p>

              ok...as promised, here is one of the interesting punishment tat my tutor told us abt...according to her, tis punishment was onli meted out once b4 to a pri 5 student she tutored several yrs b4 she tutored us...it was a very shameful n humiliating punishment n she onli meted it cos the student repeatedly refused to study his spelling or his work...
              
              according to our tutor, she made it a pt to inform the boy's parents abt his laziness b4 punishing him...the boy's parents gave her the authority to punish him over the fone...the lesson was held at our tutor's hse n there were 3 other students there...our tutor sternly ordered tat student to stand at a corner while she went to get sth...soon, she emerged wif a blouse n a short skirt...she then beckoned the student to the kitchen. moments later, the student was crying n pleading wif her in the kitchen. apparently, our tutor had ordered him to remove his clothes n put on the blouse n skirt. she also colored his lips wif lipstick n ordered him to go n stand in the middle of the living room, face the other 3 students n pull his ears. the student, of cuz didnt dare to leave the kitchen but our tutor was adamant n despite his pleas, made him do wad she had ordered him to do. needless to say, the other 3 students could not contain their laughter when they saw him...it was onli when our tutor sternly warned them not to laugh or they too wil be punished tat they stopped laughing...
              
              i stil rem tat when we heard tis account from our tutor, we didnt noe whether to laugh or to cry. we could imagine how humiliating n ashamed the boy would have felt. according to our tutor, he juz stood there pulling his ears, dressed like a gal n crying thru out. his head was lowered n it was obvious he felt very embarrassed. the gd thing for him was our tutor didnt punish him for the whole lesson. she let him off after abt 20min. we then asked her how the parents felt abt wad she did n she told us tat the parents didnt blame her cos they also felt tat their son needed to be tot a lesson. well all i can say is, its without a doubt tat the boy was tot a very gd lesson. he did become a better student after tat...

              another interesting punishment my tutor shared wif us happened in school when she punished a student from another class for being rude. it was during a chinese lesson. my tutor was conducting a class one morning when she was interrupted by a student from another class. apparently, tis student had come to her class to make a request for a student to go n see his teacher...wad angered my tutor was tat tis student jus walked up to the doorway n requested verbally for tat student, interrupting my tutor in the process. at tat time, she was in the midst of explaining certain things n tat interruption broke her train of tots...
              
              my tutor summoned the student in angrily n scolded him for being rude. she asked him y he didnt knock on the door to get her attention 1st b4 making his request. after some scolding, she allowed the student from her class to go n see the teacher while ordering the errant student to stay behind. then, as a punishment for being rude, she ordered him to stand at the doorway n keep knocking on the door continuously. in the end, the errant student was made to keep knocking on the door until my tutor released him. my tutor could nt recall how long he was punished but she knew it was long enuff to make the student show slight signs of tiredness. she let him go wif a stern warning tat if he repeated his offence again in future, she would make him knock on the staff room door for an hr after school...

              <p>harlo!!! yupyup...for the old-timers in sgforums...u may find tis familiar...but i juz tot i will post tis in a diff. forum...<br><br>all of us i believe have had our fair share of being punished in school. some punishments r more physical while others more psychological...physical ones include caning, CWO, kneeling or standing for long periods etc...psychological ones like pulling of ears, facing the wall, being ask to sing in front of whole class etc...i personally feel tat diff. punishments shld vary wif the severity of offences n the age of the student involved...surely u wun wanna shame a university student by punishing him like a primary schoolboy?<br>below is a true account of a student i noe who was punished by a teacher...he was punished for spewing 1 word of vulgarity...<br><br>student: @#%()&amp;*&amp;^%$%^*<br>teacher: U!!! COME HERE!!! HOW DARE U SAY TAT!!! COME HERE!!!<br>boy approaches n teacher scolded: WAD DID U SAY JUZ NW?! I DARE U TO REPEAT WAD U SAID JUZ NW!!!<br>STUDENT: i didnt say anything...<br>teacher: DUN DENY IT ALRITE!!! I HEARD WAD U SAID!!! I HEARD U!!!(pulls student to 1 corner) SLAP URSELF!!! SLAP!!! KEEP ON SLAPPING!!<br>(abt 10 min later) teacher: U R NT SLAPPING...U R PATTING!!!(pulls student out of class) dun wanna slap rite...face the whole school n slap...<br>in the end, DM happen to walk pass...teacher complained abt student to him n student was caned in front of whole class...<br>after the caning...<br>teacher: COME HERE!!! (pulls student to one corner) STAND HERE N CONTINUE TO SLAP URSELF!!! I WANT SLAPS NT PATS!!! (student began to slap himself) U CALL TAT SLAPPING? HARDER!!! (student slaps harder) ALRITE!!! KEEP IT TAT WAY!!!<br><br>after abt 5min...<br>teacher(points finger at student): U R NT SLAPPING AGAIN!!! I TOLD U TO SLAP HARD RITE!!! HOW DARE U DISOBEY MY ORDERS!!! DO U WANT ANOTHER ROUND OF PUBLIC CANING??? (student began slapping himself hard again) MAKE SURE U KEEP TIS UP UNTIL I SAY U CAN STOP, ONE MORE TIME...N U WILL GET IT FROM ME!!! I WANT EVERY SLAP TO BE EQUALLY HARD, DO U UNDERSTAND???<br><br>in the end, student was made to slap himself for another 10-15 min...he had red cheeks after tat n had teary eyes...thru out the time, we could hear the slaps coming from his cheeks...the teacher kept an eye on him at regular intervals to ensure every slap was hard, she gave him no chance to slack at all...wad r ur views abt tis? was the teacher too harsh? was the student deserving of the punishment? air them here...</p>
