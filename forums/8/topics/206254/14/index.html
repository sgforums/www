            <div class='col-md body'>like the incident in primary one, the teacher came out of the teacher's room on a few occasions for various reasons...according to my frend, each time she came out, she would walk past him n glance sternly at him to warn him nt to slack...in fact, my frend noted tat the teacher actually informed another teacher abt him n instructed her to keep an eye on him when she was away...it was obvious tat tis teacher intended to punish my frend very harshly as she gave no room for slacking at all...<br><br>yet as i mentioned earlier, tis teacher is stil humane...from my frend's testimony, after more than half hr of punishment, the teacher came out on 1 occasion n gave him some relief from the harsh punishment...she walked up to him wif a stern look...(words r made up but context is similar to actual)<br><br>teacher: r u feeling tired standing here n slapping urself??? (G nodded) since u have obeyed my orders so far, i am going to make a deal wif u...(G looked at the teacher expectantly while slapping himself) for the next 20min or so, u r allowed to slap slowly...but i stil expect each slap to be proper, ok?? tis shld allow ur hands some rest but u r nt to stop slapping until i say so, do u hear me??? slowing down doesnt mean nt slapping at all!!! if i catch u nt slapping at all, u wil stay back for another half hr of slapping!!! u may stand wif ur legs apart...but no standing on one leg!!!<br><br>abt 20min later, teacher stood at doorway of teacher's room...<br>teacher: stop wad u r doing n come here!!! (G stops slapping n approached the teacher) 1hr is up, u may go nw...(saw G's red cheeks) r ur cheeks very painful???<br>G(had teary eyes): yes mdm, they hurt badly...<br>teacher: so wad have u learnt from tis past hr???<br>G: i learnt nvr to use crude words again...<br>teacher: do u realli mean wad u said??? (G nodded) wil i hear crude words coming from ur mouth again??? (G shakes his head) tis is the 2nd time i have punished u for using crude words, i dun want it to happens a 3rd time, u understand??? (G nodded) wad shld i do to u if tis happens again???<br>G: eh...make me stand at sch entrance n slap myself for an hr??<br>teacher: nt onli tat!!! u wil write out 1000 times: i muz nt use crude words in sch...if u dun believe me, u can try it a 3rd time!!! (looks at her watch) alrite, i wun keep u any further, i hope u learnt from tis lesson...nw take ur bag n go hm!!! go back n tink abt wad i have said!!!</div>

COME HERE!!! HOW DARE U SAY TAT!!! COME HERE!!!<br>boy approaches n teacher scolded: WAD DID U SAY JUZ NW?! I DARE U TO REPEAT WAD U SAID JUZ NW!!!<br>STUDENT: i didnt say anything...<br>teacher: DUN DENY IT ALRITE!!! I HEARD WAD U SAID!!! I HEARD U!!!(pulls student to 1 corner) SLAP URSELF!!! SLAP!!! KEEP ON SLAPPING!!<br>(abt 10 min later) teacher: U R NT SLAPPING...U R PATTING!!!(pulls student out of class) dun wanna slap rite...face the whole school n slap...<br>in the end, DM happen to walk pass...teacher complained abt student to him n student was caned in front of whole class...<br>after the caning...<br>teacher: COME HERE!!! (pulls student to one corner) STAND HERE N CONTINUE TO SLAP URSELF!!! I WANT SLAPS NT PATS!!! (student began to slap himself) U CALL TAT SLAPPING? HARDER!!! (student slaps harder) ALRITE!!! KEEP IT TAT WAY!!!<br><br>after abt 5min...<br>teacher(points finger at student): U R NT SLAPPING AGAIN!!! I TOLD U TO SLAP HARD RITE!!! HOW DARE U DISOBEY MY ORDERS!!! DO U WANT ANOTHER ROUND OF PUBLIC CANING??? (student began slapping himself hard again) MAKE SURE U KEEP TIS UP UNTIL I SAY U CAN STOP, ONE MORE TIME...N U WILL GET IT FROM ME!!! I WANT EVERY SLAP TO BE EQUALLY HARD, DO U UNDERSTAND???<br><br>in the end, student was made to slap himself for another 10-15 min...he had red cheeks after tat n had teary eyes...thru out the time, we could hear the slaps coming from his cheeks...the teacher kept an eye on him at regular intervals to ensure every slap was hard, she gave him no chance to slack at all...wad r ur views abt tis? was the teacher too harsh? was the student deserving of the punishment? air them here...</div></blockquote>wth. teacher cannot punish already since DM already caned.<br>If i was the kid. I shouted to the teacher "YOU WANT SLAP? I GIV U SLAP!"<br>Den slapped the teacher till he/she goes on the floor.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>man, i cun imagine wad would have happened to u if u had done tat...<br>anyway, u r nt the onli one who feel the teacher went overboard...many of us also felt tat way back then...it was obvious the teacher was very angry at tat time n she vented all her anger on the student...<br><br>in fact, tat was the onli time she punished any of us so severely...she was one who would get angry at students for using vulgarities though tat was the 1st time it happened during her lesson...as i mentioned in my earlier posts, there were times when i witnessed her frowning angrily at students when she heard them using vulgarities...however, shedidnt punish any of them as the offences took place either outside sch or when it wasnt her lesson...<br><br>yet somehow, i feel tat she would have given the same punishment to anyone caught using vulgarities in her class...n she would punish the student very severely by ordering every slap to be hard n painful...fortunately for us, she wasnt in class for all the other occasions when vulgarities were used...cun imagine wad she would do if she had come to class n heard the whole class hurling vulgarites at each other...realli wonder wad she would do??? hmmm........ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>to those who think teacher punishing students are correct, or even justifiable.(that is if there are any.. coz im too lazy to read all posts), i can seriously tell u its <strong>NOT</strong> haha.. coz i have a fren work relief teacher at one of the secondary schools in the north.. jitao he just disturbs the kids and bully them for fun.. when they noisy and stuff he just make them do stupid stuff and all.. we hear liao we laugh laugh la but inside our heart we thinking knn school teacher now like that one sia.. which is not entirely false because i think you don't even have to go NIE or something to teach in a primary school right? that im not sure.. n most of the teachers will be like 24,25? pretty short-tempered young adults we have there.. n nobody takes the words of primary school kids seriously unless they vomit blood out or sth one.. so these teachers generally get away with the occasional outbursts..<br>of course im not saying all teachers are _l_, just that there are rotten apples out there making the lives of the teachers hard and those of the kids' harder..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>tis post is nt directly related to thread though it stil concerns punishments...it has to do wif how a mother disciplined her son n daughter on several occasions when they misbehaved...tis mother is actually my aunt-in-law...as my uncle needs to travel a lot in his job, my aunt-in-law had to be the one to take care of the children whenever she was hm from work...<br><br>i remember hearing her testimonies at a bbq tat she organised...she was chit-chatting wif my mum n another aunt n sharing her experiences of taking care of her children while her husband was away...as she shared the few occasions when she had to discipline her children, i was shocked tat she actually meted out such punishments...though the punishments were nt inhumane, they were rather harsh considering her son was ard 5-6yrs old while her daughter was abt 4yrs old...below is one of the cases she shared wif us...wil share the rest later...<br><br>according to her, there was once when she was at hm wif her children...they were playing wif their toys when my aunt-in-law gave her son some water to drink...her son played a fool wif the bottle while drinking despite warnings from my aunt...she kept telling him nt to play wif his bottle n to drink properly...in the end, her son dropped the bottle carelessly n spilt water on the floor...my aunt was furious of cuz and quickly went to get a cloth to clean up the mess...b4 she went, she smacked her son on his hand n scolded him harshly...next she made him stand at a corner n hold up his bottle in front of him...she ordered him to keep his hands straight in front of him n to keep it tat way for half an hr...<br><br>needless to say, her son could nt keep it up for long...according to my aunt, abt 5min after she cleared the mess, her son pleaded wif her to let him off saying his hand was very tired...my aunt response was a shocking one..she replied NO n insisted he kept his hand up...she gave tat response cos she wanted to teach her son a lesson...<br><br>it ended up wif the boy being punished for abt 15min...by then he was alredi sobbing...according to my aunt, she onli let him off prematurely when he started crying in pain n after he promised nt to play wif his drink again...to me, the punishment was a harsh one to mete out to a 5-6yrs old boy though my aunt felt he deserved it...to her she saw the need to discipline him for being naughty, hence the punishment...wad do u tink of tis??? did my aunt-in-law do the rite thing???</div>

COME HERE!!! HOW DARE U SAY TAT!!! COME HERE!!!<br>boy approaches n teacher scolded: WAD DID U SAY JUZ NW?! I DARE U TO REPEAT WAD U SAID JUZ NW!!!<br>STUDENT: i didnt say anything...<br>teacher: DUN DENY IT ALRITE!!! I HEARD WAD U SAID!!! I HEARD U!!!(pulls student to 1 corner) SLAP URSELF!!! SLAP!!! KEEP ON SLAPPING!!<br>(abt 10 min later) teacher: U R NT SLAPPING...U R PATTING!!!(pulls student out of class) dun wanna slap rite...face the whole school n slap...<br>in the end, DM happen to walk pass...teacher complained abt student to him n student was caned in front of whole class...<br>after the caning...<br>teacher: COME HERE!!! (pulls student to one corner) STAND HERE N CONTINUE TO SLAP URSELF!!! I WANT SLAPS NT PATS!!! (student began to slap himself) U CALL TAT SLAPPING? HARDER!!! (student slaps harder) ALRITE!!! KEEP IT TAT WAY!!!<br><br>after abt 5min...<br>teacher(points finger at student): U R NT SLAPPING AGAIN!!! I TOLD U TO SLAP HARD RITE!!! HOW DARE U DISOBEY MY ORDERS!!! DO U WANT ANOTHER ROUND OF PUBLIC CANING??? (student began slapping himself hard again) MAKE SURE U KEEP TIS UP UNTIL I SAY U CAN STOP, ONE MORE TIME...N U WILL GET IT FROM ME!!! I WANT EVERY SLAP TO BE EQUALLY HARD, DO U UNDERSTAND???<br><br>in the end, student was made to slap himself for another 10-15 min...he had red cheeks after tat n had teary eyes...thru out the time, we could hear the slaps coming from his cheeks...the teacher kept an eye on him at regular intervals to ensure every slap was hard, she gave him no chance to slack at all...wad r ur views abt tis? was the teacher too harsh? was the student deserving of the punishment? air them here...</div></blockquote>LOL<br><br>Why Singapore always so extreme? Now teachers (or schools in general) have almost no power over students, and when people suggests to empower teachers (or again, schools), something like this comes up.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>a relative of mine recollected his time in primary school when students were punished by the DM for toking during morning assembly...as he recalled, they had morning assemblies every morning lasting 15min each but the ones on mondays were 45min long...<br><br>monday morning assemblies would be held in the hall..the whole school would assemble in the sch hall n after the usual stuffs(national anthem, pledge announcements etc), the students wil be asked to sit down while the principal addressed the whole sch for the next half hr...<br><br>students didnt like monday morning assemblies as they were long n the students were under the watchful eyes of the prefects n DM...students caught nodding off or chitting chatting away would be punished...the punishment was the same for all though it was in every way harsh...students caught nodding off or toking would be called out by either the DM or prefects...they would be made to stand up from where they were n to hold their bags up above their heads...they would be made to do tis until the end of assembly n tis could be as long as 30min...the onli saving grace for those being punished was tat they were allowed to rest their arms by bending their albows, though they were nt allowed to put their hands down or to rest their bags on their heads...stil, the punishment was a rather harsh one n despite being allowed to bend their albows, students stil suffered much pain at the end of assembly...<br><br>in fact, according to the info given to me, the above was applicable mainly to 1st time offenders...1st time offenders would have their names taken down b4 getting punished...2nd time offenders would be given a 'double dose'...nt onli were they made to do punishment during assembly, they were also made to do punishment during recess tat same day...so they would stand outside the principal's office n hold up their bags for the ENTIRE recess...<br><br>worse was to be for 3rd time offenders...they would receive a 'triple dose'...they would do the above punishment during assembly, then again during recess n again after sch...on top of tat, their parents would be summoned to sch in the afternoon...according to my relative, he witnessed parents being summoned to sch during his sch days...the students being punished realli had a horrid time...they had to hold up their bags for abt half hr each during assembly n recess...moreover, after sch, they had to hold up their bags outside the principal's office until their parents came...a few of these students even ended up in tears from the punishments they received...<br><br>after i heard my relative's account, i was realli relieved tat those days r over...nowadays u can hardly find schools meteing out punishments of such nature...in fact back in those days, it was the principal who ordered the students to be punished in tat manner...my relative himself was caught toking once during assembly, hence he had to stand up n hold up his bag until end of assembly...according to him, he felt terrible thru out...it was very tiring to hold his bag above his head even though he could bend his albows...he did learnt his lesson after tat...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>according to my relative, the principal back then was very strict...students were very fearful of her n anyone caught misbehaving or reported to her would be punished as mentioned above...my relative recalled tat during his yrs in tat sch, there were many incidents where students were seen standing outside the principal's office, holding their bags above their heads...he recalled an incident when the principal happened to walk past his class n caught 2 gals n a boy from his class making a lot of noise while they were waiting for the teacher...furious the principal ordered them out of the class...she scolded them for their misbehaviour b4 making them stand at 3 separate corners of the corridor n hold their bags up above their heads...<br><br>from wad i noe, it was a horrible time for the 3 students...the principal instructed the class monitor tat they were to stay there until she released them n also to inform the teachers coming in later tat day abt her instructions...according to my relative, the 3 students were punished for more than an hr!!! they juz stood at their places along the corridor n held their bags up while the lessons were on...from their faces, it was obvious they were very tired having hold up their bags for so long...their form teacher actually went up to each of them to tok to them, teaching them to behave themselves in future...she also told them tat she had no authority to release them though she promised she would speak to the principal to let them go...b4 she left, she was seen wiping away tears from one of the gal's eyes...<br><br>several minutes later, their form teacher returned...she told the 3 students tat the principal was a few classrooms away, toking to a teacher...the principal had promised to come over n release them once she was done toking to tat teacher...b4 she left, the form teacher instructed the 3 students to stand properly n to hold their bags up wif their hands straight...tis was to at least give the principal the impression tat they have been doing punishment properly...she also instructed them to apologise to the principal n promise to behave themselves in future...<br><br>well, true enuff the principal came over minutes later n released the 3 students...u could see how grateful they were tat they could finally put their bags down after having held it up for more than an hr...the principal accepted their apologies n allowed them back to their seats...in my opinion, the punishment meted out by the principal was very harsh n it's probably nt seen anymore in modern day...back in those days, punishments were known to be harsh as it was believed tat severe punishments had to be given to deter/teach students nt to repeat the same offences...<br><br>i cun help but wonder wad parents would do if the above case happened in today's generation...i tink the principal wil lose her job...wad do u tink???</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i recall a case way back wheni was in kindergarten...i remember i was in K2 back then...we were having our chinese lesson when the bell rang signalling break time...hence, we lined up in an orerly manner to get our food...after all of us had taken our food n gone back to our seats to consume it, i remember asking the teacher for permission to go to the toilet...so i went nt noeing wad was in store later...<br><br>when i returned to class, i noticed there was a commotion...walking to my seat, i saw one of my classmate standing in the middle of the classroom...the teacher was in front, scolding him...she scolded him for playing a fool in class instead of sitting at his seat quietly...it turned out tat while i was away, he was making faces at some of our classmates...it ended up wif the teacher ordering him to stand in the middle of the classroom...as a punishment for wad he did, she ordered him to stick his tongue out n to keep it stuck out since he enjoyed making faces at others...<br><br>it was a funny sight!!! i remember tat within a few minutes, saliva was dripping from the tip of his tongue...the student had to constantly wipe off the saliva from his chin...by then many of us were giggling at him...even the teacher laughed at wad she saw...yet despite the 'sufferings', the teacher sternly ordered the student to keep his tongue stuck out...she then ordered the rest of the class to keep silent...<br><br>the student was finally released from his 'sufferings' after abt another 5min...by then, there were tears in his eyes...it was obvious his tongue felt dry n tired..the teacher onli released him after making him promise nt to make faces at his classmates again...i remember the teacher warning him tat if he did such a thing again, she would punish him even more severely...<br><br>well, the punishment did prove effective for a long while but its always hard for old habits to die which we shall see in my next post...</div>
