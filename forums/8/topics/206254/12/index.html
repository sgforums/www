            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>i recall a case way back in pri 1...i was walking to the canteen for recess wif another of my classmate...on the way, we past by the teacher's room...we were chitting chatting along the way when my classmate said sth tat was undesirable...i cun remember wad it was, all i noe was tat it was a crude word...well, unfortunately the form teacher of the class next to ours heard it as she entered the teacher's room...she ordered my frend to a corner n then scolded him for wad he said...<br><br>i was a gd 2metres away from my frend n the teacher then so i couldnt realli hear wad the teacher was telling my frend...all i knew was tat after some scolding, i saw my frend slapping both his cheeks...then i saw the teacher pointing her finger at him saying: hit until i tell u to stop, OK? she then proceeded into the teacher's room...<br><br>in the end, my frend had to spend the entire recess slapping his cheeks...the gd thing for him was tat the teacher was in the teacher's room most of the time so he could 'cheat' on the punishment by patting his cheeks instead of slapping...stil, my frend felt tired out as he had to stand thru out the recess n suffer the embarrassment of students walking past n giggling at him...moreover according to him, the teacher did come out from the teacher's room twice...once to get a drink, another to go to the toilet...on both occasions, the teacher would go up to him n order him to slap harder...my frend would do so until she went back into the teacher's room...<br><br>in the end the teacher onli released him when the sch bell rang signalling end of recess...it was indeed a harsh punishment considering we were onli in pri 1 then...i believe though tat the teacher nvr intended to punish my frend until he cried...she onli wanted to make him feel ashamed n to inflict a little discomfort n pain from the punishment...hoping tat the experience will deter him from future usage of crude words...tats y she punished him outside the teacher's room instead of inside...<br><br>i believe the teacher knew tat my frend 'cheated' on the punishment but chose to turn a blind eye to it as long as he kept up the 'rite' actions...which was to hit his cheeks wif his hands although softly...</blockquote>i met up wif the frend above recentlyn recollected our sch days...to my surprise, he stil remembers the above incident...he told me tat back then he said the crude word playfully...there was no ill intent...in fact, he tried to explain to the teacher tat it was juz a playful remark...however, the teacher wouldnt let him off, claiming tat if he wasnt punish for saying it playfully, he may say it wif ill intent in future...below is the dialogue he had wif the teacher(nt the exact words as my frend recalls)...<br><br>teacher: wad was tat word u said juz nw??? who taught u to say tat word???<br>my frend: madam, i dun mean wad i say...we were juz playing...<br>teacher: u can play in other ways...but to use such words is unacceptable...<br>my frend: madam, i...<br>teacher: u r onli in primary 1 n u r alredi using such words...if i let u off, i dunno how many more of such words u wil use in future...<br>my frend: madam...<br>teacher(points finger at my frend, looking stern): slap urself!!!(my frend slapped himself twice, once each on both sides)<br>teacher: keep slapping!!!(my frend began to slap himself continuously) slap until i tell u to stop, ok?<br><br>according to my frend, his cheeks did hurt after it was over...the slapping lasted for the whole 25min recess..even though he 'cheated' on the punishment,  the 'slaps' stil inflicted a little pain...moreover, as my frend recalls, he spent abt the 1st 5min slapping his cheeks quite hard...he did tat cos he wasnt sure if the teacher would allow him to 'cheat'...it was onli when his hands started to feel a little tired tat he began to slap softer, realising tat he was able to 'cheat' as the teacher wasnt looking most of the time...<br><br>i mentioned above tat i felt the teacher onli wanted to make him feel ashamed n to inflict a little discomfort n pain from the punishment...hoping tat the experience will deter him from future usage of crude words...tats y she punished him outside the teacher's room instead of inside...however, according to my frend, tat was nt the case...it was clear to him tat the teacher expected him to slap himself properly...cos other than the 2 occasions when the teacher stepped out of the teacher's room to go toilet n to buy a drink, the teacher also glared at him wif a frown each time she looked at him n saw him 'cheating' on the punishment...when my frend saw her glare, he would resume to proper slapping...hence tat explains y my frend's cheeks were sore after recess...<br><br>according to my frend, he spent abt the last 10min slapping himself properly...tis was cos when the teacher came out of the teacher's room the 2nd time to go to the toilet, she walked up to him n sternly warned him tat if she had to glare at him again for nt slapping properly, she would make him stay back after sch n slap himself for another half hr...<br><br>(teacher came out of teacher's room n walked towards my frend)<br>teacher: didnt i make myself clear juz nw??? i told u to slap urself rite??? y r u nt slapping properly?? muz i glare at u b4 u wil slap properly?? tis is the last chance i am giving u...if i have to glare at u one more time for nt slapping urself properly, u wil report to me after sch today n slap urself for another half hr!!! (teacher proceeds to the toilet)<br><br>(abt 5min later, teacher came back from the toilet)<br>teacher(looked at my frend, who was slapping himself quite hard): make sure u remember wad i juz told u!!! dun let me catch u nt slapping urself properly...n y r u standing on one leg??? stand properly!!! if u like standing on one leg so much, i wil make u stand n hop on one leg for the rest of tis wk!!! as punishment for disobeying my orders, u wil keep on slapping urself until the end of recess!!<br><br>In the end, my frend spent abt 15min slapping properly n onli abt 10min 'cheating'...as my frend recalls, he hated tat teacher after tat cos she made him feel so ashamed, letting other students see him being punished...moreover, he was onli a primary 1 kid...my frend felt the teacher punished him too harshly...he wouldnt mind being ask to slap himself but to do tat for the ENTIRE recess n wif proper slaps expected, it was nt deserving for a primary 1 kid, who was a 1st time offender...nonetheless, tat was abt 20yrs ago...nw my frend can onli look back laugh it off...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i personally agree wif my frend tat the teacher punished him too harshly back then...however, i feel tat the punishment was appropriate for the offence though the duration was too long...from the actions of the teacher, it was obvious she wanted my frend to slap himself properly for the entire 25min...tis was rather harsh considering my frend was onli in primary one then n the pain he would have suffered if he had slapped properly for the whole 25min...<br><br>it seems obvious to me n my frend tat the teacher knew the punishment was very harsh n tat she deliberately made it tat way...cos when the bell rang signalling end of recess, the teacher went up to my frend, released him from his 'agony' n asked if his cheeks were hurting alot...when my frend replied tat his cheeks were sore but stil bearable, the teacher spoke sternly tat she hoped he has learnt from tis lesson n tat she dun want to hear him use such words ever again...b4 letting him go back to class, she warned him tat if she catch him using such words again, she will make him slap himself hard for a full hr in front of the school entrance after sch...well, cun imagine if tat had realli happened, my frend would have been so badly shamed tat he probably wun feel like living...<br><br>below is a dialogue of the above...(i made up tis dialogue juz to make tis post more interesting)<br><br>(sch bell rang, teacher walked out of teacher's room n approached my frend)<br>teacher: u may stop nw!!! (my frend stopped slapping, tired n relieved) how r ur cheeks? r they very painful?<br><br>my frend (nods his head): yes madam but stil bearable...<br><br>teacher: well, i hope u have learnt from tis lesson...let tis punishment teach u nt to use vulgar words ever again...<br><br>my frend (nods his head): yes madam...<br><br>teacher: dun let me hear u use such words again, do u hear me? (my frend nods his head) if i catch u using such words again, i wil make u stay back after sch n slap urself for an hr...n u wun do it outside the teacher's room, u wil do it at the sch entrance...if u dun want everyone to see u being punished, u noe wad nt to do. do u understand?! (my frend nodded) nw go back to ur class!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the teacher who made my frend slap himself for the entire recess is the same teacher i mentioned in my earlier posts...the one who was rather strict n who would make students from her form class pull their ears outside the classroom, tape their mouths etc...tat yr she was form teacher of the class next to mine...<br><br>i remember tat yr she taught us health education...she treated us the same way as how she treated her form class...she would punish us for toking in her class, for nt bringing our health education bks, nt doing our hmwork or for misbehaving...she was very fond of punishing us away from our seats...usually, we would be made to do punishment outside classroom, at front or back of the classroom...<br><br>i stil can remember a few cases where we were punished...there was a case when one of my classmates didnt do his hmwork again...furious, the teacher ordered him to the back of the class...she made him stand at a corner n hold up his health education workbk above his head, wif both his hands straight up...the gd thing was tat health education was onli 1 period long so the punishment lasted nt more than 30min...moreover, he didnt have to hold up his workbk for the entire 30min...the teacher allowed him to put his bk down after abt half a period...however, he was made to pull his ears for the rest of the lesson...below is a dialogue of wad happened...i muz state tat the words r made up though the context as i recall is similar to wad actually happened...<br><br>(students went up row by row to hand in their workbks...teacher noticed ah seng didnt hand in his)<br>teacher: ah seng, y didnt u hand in ur bk??<br>ah seng: mdm, er...i forgot to do the hmwork...<br>teacher(walks to ah seng's desk n flipped thru his bk): ur entire hmwork is blank!!! y didnt u do ur work?? give me a gd reason!<br>ah seng: mdm, i...<br>teacher: stand up n tell me ur reason!!! (ah seng stood up, head lowered n speechless) well...so u cun give me a gd reason, rite??? so i take it tat u couldnt be bothered to do ur work! tis is nt ur 1st time, ah seng! come wif me!!!<br>(teacher marches ah seng to a corner at the back of the class)<br>teacher: stand here n face the class!! no leaning against the wall!! (hands the bk to ah seng) hold ur bk up above ur head wif both ur hands, keep ur hands straight up!!! u wil remain like tis until i say so, keep ur hands straight at all times, understand??? (ah seng nodded)<br><br>abt 15min later,<br>teacher(walked up to ah seng, who was seemingly tired..he was close to tears): so do u want to remain like tis until the end of tis lesson??? (ah seng shook his head) wil u do ur hmwork from nw onwards??? (ah seng nodded)alrite, u may put down ur hands!!! (ah seng put his aching hands down) put ur bk on the floor n pull ur ears!!! (ah seng obliged) i am giving u 1 last warning...if u forget ur hmwork again, i wil make u hold ur bk up for the entire period!!! nw stand properly n pull ur ears harder!!!<br><br>tis is juz one of the cases i can remember...wil post the rest soon...i personally feel tat the above punishment was rather harsh though my classmate did deserve to be punished for repeatedly nt doing his hmwork...its to be noted tat though he onli had to hold up his bk for abt half a period, there were signs of tiredness n discomfort on his face...my classmate was constantly under the supervision of the teacher as he stood directly in front of where the teacher was teaching albeit at the back of the class...hence, he had to keep his hands straight up thru out...for a primary 1 kid, it was rather tiring having to hold up a bk above his head for abt 15min...he was close to tears when the teacher let him put his hands down...cun imagine if he was made to hold his bk up for the entire period, he will surely end up crying in pain n tiredness...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i recall a particular lesson when a total of 6 students were punished for nt bringing our health education bks...i was one of them...the teacher was very angry tat time cos 6 students nt bringing their bks was considered a high number...in the end, the punishment she meted out was harsher than usual...usually, students who forgot to bring their bks would at most be made to stand outside the class n pull their ears...however, for tis incident, 4 of us were made to stand at isolated corners of the classroom while the other 2 stood next to the teacher's table...i can stil remember vividly tat the 2 who stood next to teacher's table were repeated offenders while the rest of us forgot our bks for the 1st time...we were made to pull our ears n do half-squats non-stop...below is the incident in dialogue...i recall roughly the words..names used r made up...<br><br>(teacher came into class n greetings was exchanged)<br>teacher: alrite class...take out ur bks n we wil start the lesson proper...(teacher saw the guilt on ah gao n ah mao's faces) b4 we start, who didnt bring their bks, own up nw!!! (ah gao n ah mao raised their hands up)<br>teacher: stand up, the 2 of u!!! anyone else??? if u dun own up nw, u wil get it if i find out myself!!! (more hands shot up, including mine)<br>teacher: 6 of u in total!!! wads wrong wif tis class today??? so many of u didnt bring ur bks!!! ah gao n ah mao, tis is nt ur 1st time rite??? well, it looks like if i dun punish the 6 of u harder than usual, there wil be no end to students nt bringing their bks!!! come forward, the 6 of u!!!<br><br>we went forward to the teacher's table...<br>teacher: ah gao n ah mao, u wil stand next to my table n face the class!!! the remaining 4 of u...despondent, go to tat corner at the back of the class! ah meng, go to the other corner! as for ah lim n ah tan, take one corner each in front of the classroom!!! the 6 of u wil pull ur ears n do half-squats!!! i want u to pull ur ears in a criss-cross manner, left hand pull rite ear n rite hand pull left ear!!! nw go to ur positions n do half-squats until i am satisfied!!!<br><br>it was a very harsh punishment considering 4 of us were 1st time offenders...ah gao n ah mao were punished next to the teacher's table cos they were repeated offender n were under direct supervision from the teacher...the teacher would glance at us nw n then while she taught to ensure we were nt slacking...<br><br>abt 15min later when all of us were seemingly tired, wif hurting legs<br>teacher(to the 4 of us): the 4 of u at the corners...do u want to keep doing half-squats for the rest of the lesson??? (all of us shook our heads) i hope tis is the 1st n last time i am punishing u for nt bringing ur bks!!! come back to ur seats, the 4 of u!!! (we went back to our seats, legs wobbly n tired)<br>teacher(to ah gao n ah mao): u boys wil keep tis up until the end of tis lesson!!! tis wil teach u nt to keep forgetting ur bks!!! i am going to tell ur form teacher abt the 2 of u!!!<br><br>finally, ah gao n ah mao were released at the end of the lesson...their legs were so tired out at the endof the lesson tat they had to limp to their seats...as far as i can recall, tis was the onli time i was punished by tis teacher but man was the punishment severe...for  primary 1 kids to do half-squats for at least 15min wif no rest was very harsh indeed...<br></div>

"-&gt; Sarcasm. Cant slap the student using her/his own hands than ask student ownself slap..Well i still think the punishment is too harsh and the teacher kinda physco how can after canning still punish the student the case should be already close.By right, a report should be file as abuse of authority that is what i think.If it is the first offence it should not take place in the class but in the office.Yupp.Its harsh! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

(2 boys raised their hands) 2 of u, stand up!!! anyone else b4 i do a spotcheck? (there was none)<br>teacher: class monitor, record down their names n give them to me!!! (looked at the 2 boys sternly) Get out of the class, both of u!!! stand along the corridor n pull ur ears!!! dun let me catch u toking to each other!!!<br><br>(teacher proceeded wif the lesson) minutes later...2 boys were whispering n giggling while the teacher was teaching...<br><br>teacher: wad r u boys doing over there??? toking n giggling away when u shld be paying attention!!! come here!!!
