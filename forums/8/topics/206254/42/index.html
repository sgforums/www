              Oh how long does the squatting last? Squatting is more tiring than standing right? Luckily most teachers prefer standing as punishment maybe because its unglam to make girls squat. Haha ...

              Maybe that's the reason why most teachers prefer standing as punishment.Anyway, the punishment should include pulling ears. Haha ... more embarassing to squat and pull ears than standing :D

              Its kinda unfair. What's the rationale boys can be caned but gals cannot? Both gender can be caned if its meant to inflict embarassement and not pain.

              I suggest each school hire a non-teaching staff to be in-charge of all punishments rather than appointing a teacher to be discipline master/mistress. This discipline staff will be stationed in the detention room and teachers will only need to send naughty students to him/her for punishment. In this way, the teachers can concentate on teaching. This discipline staff will need to record down the students' offences, decide the appropriate punishments, review and suggest new punishments and ensure that every student who commit similar offence receive same punishments.Haha ...

                              <p>friend, we are toking abt the late 80s where
              teachers had the authority to punish students any way they
              want as long they dont inflict physical injuries amounting to
              abuse.  so yes, he really slapped himself...</p>
                            </div>
                          </blockquote><br>
              If there are 2 students being punished, the teacher would order both of them to slap each other. Haha ...

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the type of punishments varies in different school even today. Standing on chair or outside classroom has been banned by MOE long time ago but there are some sec schools which have such punishments. It all depends on whether the principal allows or willing to close one eye. My friend who is teaching in sec school still punish her students to stand outside classroom and I read from some sec school students' blog that they are still being punished to stand on chair. Haha ...</div>

              <p>students nowadays have become more rebellious due to the banning of punishments in schools by MOE...whatever punishments remain now are rather light compared to 20years ago...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so the question is should MOE bring back the discipline of 20years ago where teachers were allowed to punish students any way they want except caning and physical abuse?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>personally i feel that the teacher went overboard in regards to the case above...she probably meted out that punishment out of anger without thinking of the consequences...i believe that if this took place in Singapore, she may have been sued and may even lose her job...while the student may deserved to be punished, surely smoking 40 cigarettes in 2 hrs was way too much...</p></div>

              <p>Very few, if any of you, got it as bad as I did (way back when). </p>
              <p>I did my O-levels back in 1986 in the oldest Christian Brothers' Schools here. We had 2-3 teachers who would routinely slap, kick, drag us around by our collars and throw us against the walls, lift us off our feel and slam us into the cupboards. The 2E10 classroom had a HOLE IN THE BLACKBOARD from where one unfortunate student had his head bashed into it. </p>
              <p>And yet, we got into as much mischief as any class nowadays. More, in fact. It was just that there was never any disrespect INSIDE the class. We knew where to draw the line. Whether it was fear of the rod that kept us in line, or a more strict and internalised code of conduct, I do not know.</p>
              <p>I am a teacher now.</p>
              <p>Because of my background in policing and prisons work, my schools had automatically put me to teaching the NAs and NTs.</p>
              <p>Do I think that schools need to institute corporal punishment more? No.</p>
              <p>I believe that consistency and a belief (on the students' part) that they WILL be caught and punished is more important. As long as the punishment informs, educates, is relevant and is slightly more painful than the act of disobedience was pleasurable; it will work.</p>
              <p>I've never laid a hand on my students. I've never sent one of them out of class. I've yelled at them a grand total of 5 times in the last 3 years.  And yet, I would willingly bet that I can get them motivated better than most teachers out there. </p>
              <p>It's all a matter of taking time and showing respect. </p>
              <p>Yes, this sounds overly-simplistic. It's actually harder than it sounds. But it works. For me, at least.</p>
