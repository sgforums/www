            <div class='col-md body'>Well, from all teachers whom i have come across so far...the one who made my frend do recitation for rest of lesson(refer to my much earlier post) is the strictest n harshest of all...although she hardly sent anyone to the DM or principal, she was known for long durations in punishments n shameful ones as well...very often her punishments would last for almost whole lesson if nt whole lesson...n we were onli in primary one then...<br><br>for myself, i was once made to stand for the entire lesson for toking..some of my classmates were made to stand in front of class for almost the entire lesson wif their mouths taped up...her punishments r less painful/tiring, mostly shameful...<br><br>abt the teacher who meted out the slapping punishment(see 1st post), she doesnt usually punish for long periods...n in tat yr, her punishments were mostly juz standing outside class...onli tat slapping incident plus another incident did she mete out sth diff. for tat incident, she ordered my classmate who was caught toking to stand facing whole class n pull his ears...he was utterly embarrassed...in fact tat was onli time she did tat for toking offences, she wasnt usually particular abt noise level...prob. got out on wrong side of bed tat day...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi...yup juz to add on...the harshest teacher i mentioned in my previous post was also known for corporate punishments...she would punish whole class corporately if whole class misbehaves...there were several incidents when we were made to hold our textbks between our teeth for toking...so while the teacher was teaching, we had to bite our textbks...at times, she will make us balance our textbks on our heads...these usually happened when whole class was making a lot of noise.<br><br>overall, i would still say tat female teachers r more creative in meteing out punishments...the teacher above is prob. the most creative i have met...she meted out punishments u may nvr have heard of...<br><br>i remember another case where a boy wouldnt sit still in his seat...this teacher ordered him to the front n made him sit next to teacher's table n rub his butt to n fro against the floor without stopping...though it didnt last long(less than 5 min), the boy broke down as he felt so embarrassed...the teacher let him off onli after he promised to sit still in his seat...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i juz came across tis case:<br>it appears there was a teacher who meted out sadistic punishments to her students...unlike most teachers, her basic punishment doesnt involve standing at all. her basic punishment is to make students kneel on the hard floor n pull their ears. tis she would do to those who tok in class, didnt hand up work or didnt bring their books. the duration is usually for the whole lesson.<br><br>for repeated offenders, the teacher would mete out even harsher/sadistic punishments. she would either make the students kneel on bottle caps or marbles n pull their ears...other times she would make them carry their school bags above their heads. there were even occasions when students were asked to knee-bend for entire lesson wif bags above their heads.<br><br>students who were punished were often left crying at the end. from wad i noe, few were ever able to withstand the torture n sadistic punishments. even though the punishments were effective(cos students hardly dared to repeat their offences), students often lived in fear of tis teacher.<br><br>i personally feel tis teacher was way off. wad do u tink?</div>
