            <div class='col-md body'>I have a similar problem as u tictac. I like this guy for over a year. I've always been trying to find out if he feels the same way.<br><br>He's been single for a while and wanted to stay that way. We went out a few times and we actually make out but not sex. Those times I can feel he really likes me but there is something that holds him back.<br><br>Somehow I knew and guessed that he wun want us to be anything more so we both decided not to meet anymore. But he recently had to tell me he has been thinking abt me and claims he likes me all that. But we can't be anything more than what we are now.<br><br>It really hurts me. Nothing I do seems to moved him or touched him. He just think of me in one way only. How can I continue with him when he feels that way. I think too much of him that I had terrible headaches.<br><br>It doesn't helps that he said he always think of me and what we did. I feel so depressed all the time.<br><br>Tell me how I can forget him and how to ask him to forget me no matter how much it hurts...better now than later.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guys sometimes are not as hard as they seem on the exterior. Actually, most of the time they are all mushy inside. I guess the first question that you need to ask is that if that is really the right guy for you. Is he your soulmate, man of your dreams yadda yadda...<br><br>If it is then its time to do something about it.<br><br>Anyway snowie, the lines that u mentioned the guy used sound a little cliched. Are u sure that he's not just trying to get you to bed? I'm not saying that he's a bad guy, but I guess what I saying is that be careful...<br><br>Okay anyway back to what I was saying.....most guys can usually be swayed towards a girl, if the girl does the right things. (and I don't mean offering him anything in terms of the sexual side).<br><br>There are conditions were nothing would be able to sway him though, like when he's happily attached to someone who cares and loves him and he in return is UHU glued to her.<br><br>Or when he has already decided that his life's ambition is to be a monk....<br><br>Anyway.....if you want to know how to touch a guy emotionally, stay tuned....will post up the essay once i'm done with it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>tictac: Sorry to hear what happened.<br><br>I suppose it takes time to feel a bit better, but different people have different rates of recovery. I had the same experience like you many months ago, and I'm not totally recovered yet. Yes, some people are like that, as seen in the other posts as well.<br><br>Still, reading all the advice that other people gave, its up to you what you want to do. You will have to decide whether to let go or go on. Things like this happen. Sometimes attraction is one sided, and its no ones' fault. Not yours, not his. You can't force someone to like you, although you can change his mind, but then success is not guarenteed. So, I can't give good news: You have to decide.<br><br>Meanwhile, take it easy and do whatever it takes to feel better. Some people find shopping helps, others like me find bull fighting more helpful. Nah, just bullshitting.<br><br>Feel better.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok I read all this and it makes me want to reply...<br><br>GOD!!!  It's girls like you that keep us guys single...!!!!!! :-)<br><br>No wonder guys in Singapore got such hard time getting girls even tho girls outnumber guys.<br><br>It's this thinking that girls have that they should pursue until siow...and devote their life to someone who doesn't want it in the first place....and regret what?  you can't regret something you never had.<br><br>Sorry to be the cold water on your faces, but this is how I feel...sorry because noone ever so dedicated to me before..hee hee:-)<br><br>And noone is the one for you if your not the one for him....just a fact of life.  So you can pine after him all you want, but the reality is that  if he doesn't have feeligns for you after so long he never will.<br><br>I also loved this friend of mine for so long now, but finally left (still friends tho)...or gave up because she just doesn't have that feeling for me...even tho we love each other in other ways....long itme ago.<br><br>In the end, I never regretted it...in fact I saved myself a lot of heart ache and lost time...In those years that I pined for her, I was single...so many years lost on nothing...just friends would have sufficed and could have still gotten a GF along the way...but NOOO...<br><br>"Loving someone hard enuff won't make them love you back"<br><br>sorry, but it's true...if they feel it they do...if they don't move one...and because your still friends if anything happens it will happen...wait around and you basically throw your whole youth away.<br><br>Just take it that you will marry him later, but for now go out and enjoy yourslef...meet other people...dun need to forget him, just enjoy yourself.....like everyone has said...if its going to happen it willl...<br><br>Give us guys a chance pklease...(on our kneess)....I wish a girl was like that for me man...It's always the guys who dun want that get this kind of attention...*groan*</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanx to all those pple who replied here. Anyway, I know that all that I've done are real stupid, wat I am waiting for actually? For him to say something that I know he neber will?<br><br>Firewire:<br>I guess its the remnants of the spoilt brat in me. I want this means I want this, and if I try hard enuff, I will get it eventually. I should have understand that human dun act that way, they dun reciprocate yur feelings simply coz u feel for them.<br><br>I did go out and meet other guys but I can't help comparing.<br><br>Think I shld start taking these "stamps" off my eyes and really really see pple as they are, instead of simply using them as comparisions agst wat I can neber have.<br><br>Hope I can persist through this and get over him once and for all this time! Hmm... perhaps an outing with u guys will make my eyes open wide wide? Hee..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yep, I agree with Firewire (as usual haha)....and that most girls think that sticking to one guy who does not love them is being "faithful" and "loyal". I do have a few friends like that, who are drastically limiting their choices and they themselves have admitted rejecting many potential good guys because of this. What a pity !<br><br>It's sad to see a woman throw her future away by being faithful to a guy who will eventually dump her. As Firewire said too...it's always the guys who DON'T want the attention from girls that eventually get it....haha guys like me can simply just hope and wait ! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Just an advice to girls, if you're young, give yourself more chances to see the world before settling down. Don't live to regret your decisions later in life.....<br>It'll also give more guys a chance to chase more women (believe me when I go out into the job market in 6 months about 70 % of all the women are already attached or married !).....and will help to "stabilize the economy"...hehehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>tictac - Good luck to you in your future endeavours, and may you meet your Prince Charming soon.<br><br>Cheers !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tictac,<br><br>dun know how to console you. When I was in Sec School, I had an unreciprocated crush on a guy for 3 years too. Finally gave up when he got attached to this rich and beautiful girl. I'm a late bloomer, there was no way i could have competed with her. But now, I can probably beat her hands down. But I dun think I want that guy anymore  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Seriously, if waiting for him for 3 years doesn't work, it's time to move on. It's unlikely he will reciprocate alredi. It may be painful but 'chang tong bu ru duan tong'.<br><br></div>
