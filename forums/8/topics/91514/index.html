Have to think very carefully.<br>Especially when it come to finance. 23 for a guy, just came out of NS, need to further study n climb the corporate ladder.<br>Don't want to quarrel over money after marriage.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think its a case of common logic and utility involved with relationships. Surely a man who has more dates and girlfriends at a time would enjoy more utility than someone with just 1 gf or no gf.<br><br>Unless a girl explicitly asks me to commit to her, i will not,  I will respond to other girls affections as well. And girls i know ,whom i haven't asked to commit to me, will also seek thrills with other guys. That's the way of the world, MAXIMISE enjoyment, ever more so with this hectic lifestyle here.<br><br>Thus boys and girls keep their options open until asked to commit, and they would rather PROLONG this non-commitment stance in order to continue maximising their romantic satisfaction, regardless of money/degrees involved.<br><br>Also, there is no gender reversal. Its just that more and more women here are becoming more independent and seeking multiple thrills.<br><br></div>
