            <div class='col-md body'>Kids do say the darnest things....<br><br>A kindergarten pupil told his teacher he'd found a cat. She asked him if it<br>was dead or alive. "Dead." She was informed.<br>"How do you know?" she asked her pupil.<br>"Because I pissed in its ear and it didn't move," answered the child<br>innocently. "You did WHAT?!?" the teacher exclaimed in surprise.<br>"You know," explained the boy, "I leaned over and went 'Pssst!' and it<br>didn't move."<br>_______________________________________________<br><br>A small boy is sent to bed by his father. Five minutes later....<br>"Da-ad...." "What?" "I'm thirsty. Can you bring drink of water?"<br>"No. You had your chance. Lights out."<br>Five minutes later:"Da-aaaad....."<br>"WHAT?"<br>"I'm THIRSTY. Can I have a drink of water??"<br>"I told you NO!" If you ask again, I'll have to spank you!!"<br>Five minutes later...... "Daaaa-aaaad....."<br>"WHAT!"<br>"When you come in to spank me, can you bring a drink of water?"<br>_________________________________________________<br><br>An exasperated mother, whose son was always getting into mischief, finally<br>asked him, "How do you expect to get into Heaven?"<br>The boy thought it over and said, "Well, I'll run in and out and in and out<br>and keep slamming the door until St. Peter says, 'For Heaven's sake,<br>Dylan,come in or stay out!'"<br>_________________________________________________<br><br>One summer evening during a violent thunderstorm a mother was tucking her<br>son into bed. She was about to turn off the light when he asked with a<br>tremor in his voice, "Mommy, will you sleep with me tonight?"<br>The mother smiled and gave him a reassuring hug. "I can't dear," she said.<br>"I have to sleep in Daddy's room."<br>A long silence was broken at last by his shaky little voice:"The big<br>sissy."<br>_________________________________________________<br><br>When I was six months pregnant with my third child, my three year old came<br>into the room when I was just getting ready to get into the shower.<br>She said, "Mommy, you are getting fat!"<br>I replied, "Yes, honey, remember Mommy has a baby growing in her tummy"<br>"I know," she replied, "but what's growing in your butt?"<br>_________________________________________________<br><br>A little boy was doing his math homework.<br>He said to himself,"Two plus five, that son of a bitch is seven. Three plus<br>six,  that son of a bitch is nine...."<br>His mother heard what he was saying and gasped, "What are you doing?"<br>The little boy answered, "I'm doing my math homework, Mom."<br>"And this is how your teacher taught you to do it?" the mother asked.<br>"Yes," he answered.<br>Infuriated, the mother asked the teacher the next day, "What are you<br>teaching my son in math?"<br>The teacher replied, "Right now, we are learning addition."<br>The mother asked, "And are you teaching them to say two plus two, that son<br>of a bitch is four?"<br>After the teacher stopped laughing, she answered, "What I taught them was,<br>two plus two, THE SUM OF WHICH, is four."<br>_________________________________________________<br><br>One day the first grade teacher was reading the story of Chicken Little to<br>her class. She came to the part of the story where Chicken Little tried to<br>warn the farmer. She read, ".... and so Chicken Little went up to the<br>farmer and said, "The sky is falling, the sky is falling!" The teacher<br>paused then asked the class,<br>"And what do you think the farmer said?"<br>One little girl raised her hand and said, "I think he said:"Holy Shit! A<br>talking  chicken!'" The teacher was unable to teach for the next 10<br>minutes.<br><br></div>
