And he told his mum, this buddy of his has been forsake by his family and he felt sorry for him.<br><br>His mum reply, saying it's kind of in convien.. etc.. to have the handicapped mate around.  And their home isn't handicapped friendly environment.<br>Thus asking if the son could find a suitable home to house his friend.<br><br>Upon reading this letter from his mum, tears rolled down his cheeks.<br>As the fellow mate he is talking is actually the author himself.<br>And he actually committed suicide after reading the letter from home.<br></div></blockquote>This is crapped. And the soldier is really stupid because it naturally to reject others but mother will not reject their sons.<br><br>Even if her mother truly dun accept him, he should not have taken his life cos life is so valuable.
