Today we realize that the natural world is more complex and fascinating than originally believed.<br><br>You assume that the natural world has a clearly defined limit after which science is inapplicable.

But the strength (and concurrent weakness) of science is that its aware of where it is stretched thin. What happens before Planck Time?

They are well aware of the strengths and weaknesses of their techniques and models. The current worldview we have is assembled from a vast array of approaches and evidence. The Big Bang theory is well supported by data, better than alternative models like the steady state theory.<br><br>Of course it is not the absolute truth - a future Einstein-like physicist may propose a even neater theory. But it must explain all existing evidence better than the Big Bang theory in order to supplant it.<br><br>Only an evidence-supported theory can displace another evidence-supported theory.<br><br>"Belief" in scientific theory does not rely on faith - if someone comes up with an elegant new theory that explains the beginnings of the Universe even better than Big Bang, then most scientists will celebrate this new discovery instead of clinging to the old theory.</div>
