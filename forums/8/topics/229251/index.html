That way, we are led to believe that God answers every single prayer of the believer, one way or another.<br><br>But, could it be that this could be used as a cop-out?<br><br>I mean, could it be that one of the reasons some of our prayers are not anwered is because God will not listen to our prayer? Maybe in some cases God is not saying yes because there is sin in our lives and it is blocking our prayers?<br><br>As far as I can tell, there are 3 major qualifications that must be met in order to have a prayer answered. (1) Right motives, (2) With a clean heart and (3) Within the will of God.<br><br>The Bible tells us, "You ask and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, to spend it on your passions." (James 4:3). If our motive is to get a new car and a bigger wardrobe or fame and fortune, your prayer will probably not be answered.<br><br>The Bible also tells us that "If I had cherished iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not have listened." (Psalm 66:1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. As long as we hang onto sin and refuse to confess and forsake it, God will not listen to our prayer, no matter how eloquent the prayer is.<br><br>Then we are told, "Whatever you ask in my name, this I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son." (John 14:13). Asking in His name does not mean tacking on "In Jesus' Name, Amen" at the end of every prayer. It simply means praying as if it is something Jesus would pray. Doing so glorifies God and He answers.<br><br>Now, the cop-out comes when we boldly smile and when God does not answer our prayer as we say, "He said no." or "God must be saying, "Wait."" The problem with that is, you may be mistaking the symptom that there is a problem, with being the answer itself!<br><br>If your prayers are not being answered, try examining yourself.

That way, we are led to believe that God answers every single prayer of the believer, one way or another.<br><br>But, could it be that this could be used as a cop-out?<br><br>I mean, could it be that one of the reasons some of our prayers are not anwered is because God will not listen to our prayer? Maybe in some cases God is not saying yes because there is sin in our lives and it is blocking our prayers?<br><br>As far as I can tell, there are 3 major qualifications that must be met in order to have a prayer answered. (1) Right motives, (2) With a clean heart and (3) Within the will of God.<br><br>The Bible tells us, "You ask and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, to spend it on your passions." (James 4:3). If our motive is to get a new car and a bigger wardrobe or fame and fortune, your prayer will probably not be answered.<br><br>The Bible also tells us that "If I had cherished iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not have listened." (Psalm 66:1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. As long as we hang onto sin and refuse to confess and forsake it, God will not listen to our prayer, no matter how eloquent the prayer is.<br><br>Then we are told, "Whatever you ask in my name, this I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son." (John 14:13). Asking in His name does not mean tacking on "In Jesus' Name, Amen" at the end of every prayer. It simply means praying as if it is something Jesus would pray. Doing so glorifies God and He answers.<br><br>Now, the cop-out comes when we boldly smile and when God does not answer our prayer as we say, "He said no." or "God must be saying, "Wait.""

Of course there is always "Wait".<br><br>Meanwhile on the planet of the Great Hypercomputer the people celebrate the death of the Microcomputer Man.<br><br>"The microcomputer will never be as great as the Hypercomputer!" the people chanted in unison. The Microcomputer Man was just a blind, ignorant, small-minded man who thought he saw nothing inside the Hypercomputer, whereas everyone else could feel the other dimensional parts.<br><br>How can a system made of visible, well-understood components into a comprehensible organization ever beat a System made up of invisible, mysterious trans-dimensional components?<br><br>Never.</div>
