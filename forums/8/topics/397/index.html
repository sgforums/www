            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously I can't think of any vocation that is good to sign on. A lot of people sign on some relaxing vocation just to escape tough army training.

Isn't it stupid?<br><br>As a regular in SAF, he had to follow posting order, so far I don't know any unit which allow you to stay throughout for 10 years or lifetime without being posted to other units. Even if there are units which allow you to stay there doing same thing over and over again for 10 years or even a lifetime, no matter how interested you are towards the vocation, spending 10 years doing the same thing over and over again.

You only see some of your friends who loves the SAF. As for me, I seen so many people who regretted signing on. Much much more than those who enjoy it. The pay is well? I doubt so, I always believe if you are capable, you can earn much much better pay in the outside world.<br><br>You also mention if a person is able to adapt to the type of life of a SAF personnel, then signing on is not a bad idea. Now I got a question, what if the person cannot adapt to the life in SAF? On surface everything seems well, only when you got into the unit and that is the time most people started to regret. Believe me, I seen far too many people who regretted already. SAF retirement scheme is attractive? Do you really think so? For officiers, if you can't get a least a LTC by 45 years old, that means that will be the end of your career in SAF, you will be given a large sum for retirement at 45 years old, think carefully. 45 years old. With them amount for retirement, how are you going to survive for the rest of your life? Don't just look at things on the surface, see deeper and think carefully.<br><br>You choose not to sign on just because you are an undergraduate in IT, does it mean that if you are not an undergraduate in IT you will sign on? Are you trying to say only those with qualification that can expend their expertise in SAF should sign on?</div>

You only see some of your friends who loves the SAF. As for me, I seen so many people who regretted signing on. Much much more than those who enjoy it. The pay is well?

Believe me, I seen far too many people who regretted already. SAF retirement scheme is attractive? Do you really think so? For officiers, if you can't get a least a LTC by 45 years old, that means that will be the end of your career in SAF, you will be given a large sum for retirement at 45 years old, think carefully. 45 years old. With them amount for retirement, how are you going to survive for the rest of your life?

You can't resign as and when you like. Many people thought that they would like their job but in the end they found that they can take all the strict rules, all the strict punishment. I seens far too many cases already. What is the point of looking for a job which you might regret and there is no way out because you are tied down by bond? Unless you willing to pay back the the money.<br><br>As you said, life is never a bed of rose. So why choose a career that you might regret and cannot resign due to tied down by contract? Ehy not choose a career that is free and easy to make any advancement?<br><br>For the retirement scheme, do you know why so many people refuse to continue their service as a NUSAF after they retired? That is because the pay is much much lesser than what they drew during their service terms. Imagine someone who used to draw $6000 got to reduce his pay to only $3000. Do you think he can get use to living with such a great pay drop? As a NUSAF, the rank system is different, you don't keep your previous rank in NUSAF.<br><br>You keep saying as if SAF is such a good career. You also said that not only expertise in SAF should sign on. SAF career is not only a job, a career. There are much much more as a job. Look things in a more general ways. In outside world, your career is your career. In SAF you do much more things other than your own job. Don't keep looking only in a angle. Even you yourself also feel that you got more opportunity in the outside world. Even you yourself also refuse to sign on.<br><br>If SAF is so good, why so many people refuse to sign on?

In SAF, your career is totally different from the outside world. Far too different. As you already said in SAF everything is in black and white, you need to follow all orders regardless it is right or wrong. Career in SAF got to do much more than what suppose to be done.<br><br>Outside world if you dislike the job dislike your boss, you can just throw in your resignation letter. In SAF, you cannot. Being 'marked' by your superior ended up being 'tekan'. Doing a lot of extra work. Do you get the point? I seen a lot of people after signing on unable to take the rules in SAF. You only seen the good side of it. Have you really seen the evil side in SAF? Do you know how many people regretted signing on the navy?</div>
