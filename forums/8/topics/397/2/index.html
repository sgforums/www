            <div class='col-md body'>HI guys.. It's since a long time I have been here.. Anyway I as a Regular.. These are my view towards SAF Life.. Its' True that SAF is Binded with RULES RULES &amp; RULES.. But if you can remember the days of entranchments.. you can clearly see that mostly all women between the age of 19-30 signed as NUSAF.. Why is that so?? JOB SECURITY.. Right!!!<br>What I believe is that if you know your Job no Mother Son would touch you..Let it be a COL nor a LTA. Well people regret signing on is because they are the people with some attitudes which cannot last them long in the SAF.<br><br>Another thing is the pay difference in the SAF and in the Civilian sectors.. No one can deny the fact that there is a pay difference. You earn about $2500/- after 6 years of service, but if you have a IT diploma and work for a Civilian sector you could be earning about 1800-1900 for the first year itself.. So imagine by the end of 6 years you could be earning about 5-6K. So definetly ppl would prefer the civilian life.. And more there can even work OT, and earn more..<br><br>But SAF lunlun ahahahahha. But one thing for sure if you know the job you can survive anywhere, regardless of SAF or private sectors..<br><br>------------------<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have only seen 3 types of people signing on in my camp.<br><br>1) Degree Holders who usually have some forms of scholership for them<br>2) People who are in need of money at that particular period<br>3) People who have family problems and dun like to go home<br><br>Personally I think SAF is quite f***ed up in the sense that we don't look like soldiers; we look like cheap labours to the government. For example my unit had to even bring the standy platoon down for NDP, like tat might as well dun have a standby platoon. If Malaysia decides to invade Singapore on NDP then die liao lor....most probably you will see the platoon stuck in the crowd.<br><br>Rememeber the Millieum Swing party in 1999? My battalion also went down to do crowd control. What I can say is tat ppl dun give a damn for ppl from the army. The respect we get from them is zero or maybe negative. I seriously doubted the army recruitment slogan " A Career that Commands Respect" Pui!!!!<br><br>When I was commissioned  I was told I must serve with Pride, Honour and Integrity. How can SAF expect tat from us when whatever we do are being depised and not appreciated.<br><br>Signing on in the army yes can earn you one of the highest starting pay but that is probably what you will earn for the next 10 years. I think if anyone who wants to sign on please seriously consider before doing so and try the system out during your NS before doing anything rash.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Desert Fox (edited 02 January 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Simon the Snow Blower:</div><div class="quote_body"> Does it mean that you already agree to my first point? </div></blockquote>Well, one man's meat maybe another man's poison. So I won't touch on that.<br><br><blockquote>[B}Second point, career in SAF is bonded by contract. You can't resign as and when you like. Many people thought that they would like their job but in the end they found that they can take all the strict rules, all the strict punishment. I seens far too many cases already. What is the point of looking for a job which you might regret and there is no way out because you are tied down by bond? Unless you willing to pay back the the money.[/B]</blockquote>Most people I know signed on because of the money. U have to admit that SAF is paying better than most private organizations given a standard level of education. They even provide diploma courses for those with 'O' levels. I believe we cannot hide from this.<br><br><blockquote><strong>As you said, life is never a bed of rose. So why choose a career that you might regret and cannot resign due to tied down by contract? Ehy not choose a career that is free and easy to make any advancement? </strong></blockquote>I am not saying that u can't. I am just citing SAF as an alternative career.<br><br><blockquote><strong>For the retirement scheme, do you know why so many people refuse to continue their service as a NUSAF after they retired? That is because the pay is much much lesser than what they drew during their service terms. Imagine someone who used to draw $6000 got to reduce his pay to only $3000. Do you think he can get use to living with such a great pay drop? As a NUSAF, the rank system is different, you don't keep your previous rank in NUSAF.</strong></blockquote>Correct. U get paid more for what u do. Which organization would want to pay someone a high pay for not doing much? If there is, you must let me know. I think I might wanna join them.  :p<br><br><blockquote><strong>You keep saying as if SAF is such a good career. You also said that not only expertise in SAF should sign on. SAF career is not only a job, a career. There are much much more as a job. Look things in a more general ways. In outside world, your career is your career. In SAF you do much more things other than your own job. Don't keep looking only in a angle. Even you yourself also feel that you got more opportunity in the outside world. Even you yourself also refuse to sign on.</strong></blockquote>The reason why I chose not to sign on is that there isn't much opportunites for me to develope my expertise in IT in SAF, not because of the rules and regimentation. As a career, I believe each individual has cause to choose what is best for him/her. If he/she thinks that SAF is the best option for them, and it is able to provide what other organizations cannot provide, why not??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Glad to hear your views on this, but please do not get too perturbed by what I say.

I had never cited poverty as one of the reasons as this is one main cause of unhappiness and discontentment in the course of a career in the SAF. It is not of free will that they signed on. I am looking at the point of people who signed on with the SAF as a career, a job prospect. Of course, if u had mentioned poverty being one of the reasons of people signing on, then that's a different issue.</div>

I had never cited poverty as one of the reasons as this is one main cause of unhappiness and discontentment in the course of a career in the SAF. It is not of free will that they signed on. I am looking at the point of people who signed on with the SAF as a career, a job prospect. Of course, if u had mentioned poverty being one of the reasons of people signing on, then that's a different issue.</div></blockquote>Financial is always the main reason why people sign on. Facts are always the facts. How many people sign on navy because of financial? How many people thought that navy is relaxing and regretted signing on after that? How many people after signing on can stand regimental life? There are many many example I saw in my life in navy. If you insist that it is good, so be it. In SAF, you do much more than what your vocation needs to do. You may thought you love the vocation, after signing on than start to regret and it will be too late.<br><br>Right from the start, I already stress that you only sign on if you loves the forces, not the vocation.</div>

So I won't touch on that.</div></blockquote>I don't see any reason why you wouldn't touch on this point? Is it because I am right with this?<br><br><blockquote><strong>Most people I know signed on because of the money. U have to admit that SAF is paying better than most private organizations given a standard level of education. They even provide diploma courses for those with 'O' levels. I believe we cannot hide from this.</strong></blockquote>SAf pay is indeed better only at the beginning. If you are capable, you can earn much better money along the way. Not only SAF provide diploma course. Private sector also provide upgrading course for staffs. If you want to compare this point, I believe private sector wouldn't lose out.<br><br><blockquote><strong>I am not saying that u can't. I am just citing SAF as an alternative career.</strong></blockquote>You already said that it is an alternative career. Than please answer my question on why choose a career that you might regret and cannot resign due to tied down by contract? Why not choose a career that is free and easy to make any advancement? I will like to hear an answer from you regarding this point.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Correct. U get paid more for what u do. Which organization would want to pay someone a high pay for not doing much? If there is, you must let me know. I think I might wanna join them.</strong></blockquote>SAF is said to be a place for those high ranking people drawing high pay to do nothing and those NSF to do all the shit things. If you think you are the lazy type who can't perform on work or refuse to do work, go ahead to sign on SAF. I believe SAF is best for this type of people. Are you trying to tell me you are one of the lazy type or those who can't perform on work? If choose to lead such a meaningless life is something you want, than I really feel very sad for you. You already prove to me that you are one of those lazy type who wants high pay yet refuse to work. From what you just said, I really start to look down on you.<br><br><blockquote><strong>The reason why I chose not to sign on is that there isn't much opportunites for me to develope my expertise in IT in SAF, not because of the rules and regimentation. As a career, I believe each individual has cause to choose what is best for him/her. If he/she thinks that SAF is the best option for them, and it is able to provide what other organizations cannot provide, why not??</strong></blockquote>You already said that individual has to choose what is best for him/her, I stress my point again. SAF is definitely not a best alternative for those who can't stand regimential life. Further more once you sign on, you cannot back out. Why choose a job which got no way out once you regret? Jobs are plentiful outside.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Glad to hear your views on this, but please do not get too perturbed by what I say. It is just my personal opinion.</strong></blockquote>You personnal opinion is you keep claming SAF is good to sign on. Yet when I stress the bad point, you either keep avoiding or shift the attention to somewhere else. If you want the discussion to go on. Please answer the points I pointed out.<br><br>From what I read in most of the replies, only you seems to support signing on. I believe you also read the others reply. They also stress out why SAF is not good to sign on. Look at things in a more general ways why people feels that it is not good to sign on and not keep thinking just because those friends around you like the force mean it is good.</div>
