My point is why choose a career that got so much restriction? SAF everything is in black and white, as you already said. My question is what if you regret?<br><br>SAF is indeed better than last time. But that doesn't mean that SAF is good. SAF is still as fuck up as last time. Outside world, you ca choose to do the shit or not. In SAF, reagrdless it is shit or not you still got to do. You get this point?<br><br>Most of the people complain because they do not have the money to return. My point is right again, why choose a job that need to be bonded by contract and pay back when back out? You cannot just resign as and when you want.<br><br>Please read carefully. You don't dare to face my question yet trying to escape from it. Now being ask to answer my question, you say I trying to claim right. As you already said all this is based on individual thinking, than why you want to reply to my post right from the start if you respect my point of view? You don't respect my point of view and you are trying to find my fault right from the start. I hope you don't escape from answering this question. Lastly all your comparsion cannot stand. You compare all those things that outside world also can provide yet keep claiming that SAF is good SAF is best.<br><br>You work from 8.30am to 9.00pm doesn't mean you are hard working if you are looking for a job that doesn't require you to do anything yet getting high pay. Your point on doing nothing yet wishing to get high pay has already spoilt your image in me. And not to forget SAF got plenty of this type of people.</div></blockquote>Well, if u insist that I did not answer your question, then that's too bad.

Not because I am wrong or what, what u have failed to see my point of stand. So let's keep it that way that SAF is good and bad in its own sense.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I reply to your posting is to allow u to have more vision of everything. We will always compare the pros and cons before we decide whether anything is good or bad for us. If u choose to see that I don't respect your point of view, then that's too bad. I will not argue on this too. It is pointless to argue on this.<br><br>In any working environment, there is a lot of "shit" which exists in different forms. This is up to each individual to choose whether it's "good shit" or "bad shit".  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I like your points too, but lets keep this discussion professional, yah??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

However most of the questions which you can't answer you choose to escape from them.<br><br>In a serious discussion. I take things seriously. If you want me to joke like a fool, I can do that also.<br><br>You don't seems to see my point either? You keep claiming this is good that is good but all your claim can't stand at all. How SAF is fuck up, everybody got eyes to see and got mind to judge, you can keep dreaming in your dreamland if you like.<br><br>You choose to reply to my point that is because you feel that I am wrong. Am I right to say that? And since you reply to my post, I reply back. All the while you keep claiming you are right, everything you are right and everything I am wrong. You call that respect my point of view? If you don't respect my point of view, than why must I respect your view?<br><br>There is no such thing as good shit. The only difference is whether you can escape from the shit or not. SAF definitely cannot escape.<br><br>You like my point? I doubt, just look at the way you reply, to me you totally seems to think you are right and I am wrong. You can continue to say I am wrong. Facts are always facts. There are a lot of things in SAF which is true and you cannot run away from it. Face it! Fact the true which happen in SAF.</div>

What another lame excuse you can think of, need a contract job so that he wouldn't resign so easily. Mr Moose, since start you had been trying hard to think of excuses to say sign on is good. Excuses after excuses. I really hope you can answer me on why is it good to sign on in SAF rather than keep finding excuses to say SAF is good to sign on. If you tell them they don't have bond, not happy working, that's why resign. I can tell you, even you got bond and you happy working there yet giving this type of attitude, regardless where you can find a job. You are wrong Mr Moose, most companies does not practice bond.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Fearless (edited 07 January 2001).]</div>

Outside world difficult to find job when economy is down, outside world can get charged easily, outside world got 1 week or 1 month contract etc etc. Now your change your words when you not going to extend your contract. So now which is your point of stand? SAF better or outside world better? Or when it come to other people, SAF better, come to you yourself, outside world better?</div>
