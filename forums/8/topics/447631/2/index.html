              what happens here happens in other countries too.
              foreigners come here and work, get PR, get scholarship.  some singaporeans do the same in another country. so its fair.
              if you want to blame. blame yourself for not having the pedigree to be invited.

              Why Sg govt is offering PR / scholarships to foreigners is obvious. first they can boost their unis international ranking,
                                
                                
              Second they can bond them for a few years and there is a certain % of them will become Sg citizens, then guarantee them votes for the PAP in the next erection !!
                                
                                
              Theres nothing to benefit them to offer all sporeans places in national uni. Cos they know from experience if they do so, most who graduate will flock to another country !! 
                                
                                
              Only 25% of whole sg population get to enter local unis, so the remaining 75% of you if you want a uni degree, you have to do it privately !! And just out of NS, without much savings, you would definitely have to take up a study loan !!
                                
                                
              But after taking that study loan you'll be in debt !! And to repay that debt you have to work !! And you'll have to work at least for a few years before your debt can be paid off in full !!  
                                
                                
              So the govt they tie you up for good to contribute to their economy and GDP !! Which in turn they will use to justify their high salaries !!
                                
                                
              This whole thing is just a big government conspiracy, all to benefit themselves !!!
