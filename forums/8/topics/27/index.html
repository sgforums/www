            <div class='col-md body'>Just saw Argentina draw with Sweden and suffer a first round exit. A nation in bankruptcy, with their national federation unable to even pay for the transport of the team to Tokyo. They were eliminated largely to a loss to England in the previous match. But oh, how my heart aches for the millions of Argentinians in the poverty stricken country many of whom have but one source to draw their happiness and inspiration from. Many Singaporeans support team England, for various reasons only themselves know. Most also felt that England got its revenge over Argentina for its ignominious last loss in 1998. Yet I am sure every Argentinian who watched the match was happy, as they were when Diego Maradona scored the wonderful "Hand of God" goal in 1986 when they beat the English. But sadly, God probably doesn't wave his hand that often. I must confess that I'm not a keen supporter of England in anything it does. Its schools are old, its economy floundering, but people still flock to places like its renowned London School of Economics, to study economics! Its like buying pimple cream from a hideously pockmarked salesgirl who was once awesomely beautiful, in my opinion. I'd probably go there only to study History...<br><br>The Argentine hate the English. Why? Well, wouldn't you hate someone who stepped into your house, took your computer away and colonized your bathroom? In 1982, the English invaded Argentina and annexed the Falklands, which they hold up till today. For that, it is a matter of national pride that the Argentines must beat England. A pity God's Hand wasn't there.<br><br>I'm going to bet on England to lose next round. And Japan too.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hm...i agree that Argentina didn't deserve to lose at this stage.But the credit goes to Sweden,who defended exceptionally well as a team n even managed to score a goal with its limited attacks.Therefore,Argentina has no one to blame but itself for not progressing to the 2nd round.Even though i'm an England fan,i think that they would not win the world cup with its current squad.They lacked that extra bite which teams like Brazil has.<br>But i hope they will go far. Like i have mentioned earlier,this is a "Hei Ma" world cup.Therefore,a "Hei" country would win it.<br>n it's none other than the Lions of Africa-Senegal!!!<br><br>------------------<br><blockquote>Let us not look back in anger or forward in fear but around in awareness.<br>-James Thurber</blockquote></div>
