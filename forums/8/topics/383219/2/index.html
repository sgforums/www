                  skills and ultimately lack independence to make strong life
                  altering decisions.. What a stupid propaganda article . Makes a
                  laughing stock out of singapore. There is a tammy here, 5 kids gang

                  Australian kids are portrayed as indisciplined in the media, they
                  are independent thinking and make their own life decisions, A they
                  grow older, many of them will just come out of their nutshell and
                  start to be serious about life. This is life, everyone's life is
                  like that. Apart from that, not every kid in australia sucks,
                   Its their individuality, character which makes people out of

              <p>Let yr kids expereince life in the jungle, they will then know

              <p>No matter how strict singapore is, it still under western
                  influence thanks to mainstream media and the govt which lets in
                  this kind of exposure for the sake of economy . No amount of
                  discipline can tame a kid for long. I have seen many people growing
                  up together with me who were disciplined during their teens but
                  once grow up they start doing "things which they missed in their
                  childhood" in their 20s and 30s. This includes alcholism ,
                  drinking, smoking, sex ect. It boils down to individuality,
                  character and pre-disposed genes.</p>
