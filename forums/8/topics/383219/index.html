              <p> These 2 dumb typical middle aged couple. dont get me wrong, being strict and being repressive are 2 different things. In australian society, the parents generally give more freedom to their kids to gain more exposure unlike stupid singapore kids are get spoonfed all the time and lack personal independence overprotected by the laws. Despite this , u still see local kids are a big disappointment in personal discipline, intra-personal skills and ultimately lack independence to make strong life altering decisions.. What a stupid propaganda article . Makes a laughing stock out of singapore. There is a tammy here, 5 kids gang rape a girl, lesbians and gay culture. <strong>What makes them think singapore is any better than australia?</strong> Though Australian kids are portrayed as indisciplined in the media, they are independent thinking and make their own life decisions, A they grow older, many of them will just come out of their nutshell and start to be serious about life. This is life, everyone's life is like that. Apart from that, not every kid in australia sucks,  Its their individuality, character which makes people out of them.</p>
              <p>Let yr kids expereince life in the jungle, they will then know self actualisation.</p>
              <p>No matter how strict singapore is, it still under western influence thanks to mainstream media and the govt which lets in this kind of exposure for the sake of economy . No amount of discipline can tame a kid for long. I have seen many people growing up together with me who were disciplined during their teens but once grow up they start doing "things which they missed in their childhood" in their 20s and 30s. This includes alcholism , drinking, smoking, sex ect. It boils down to individuality, character and pre-disposed genes.</p>
              <p>Look at how our adults behave in so called strict singapore.</p>

              <p>the most important thing is to teach kids about the dangers of life in the jungle, Not over protect them with disciplinary methods. sooner or later they will get exposure to these . And now with the internet , its so much easier than decades ago. the trick is to teach them to think for themselves,</p>
              <p>I am fne example ehre, when i was young my parents were strict but when i grew up after age 21 i started doing the very same things which most parents dont want. of ocs at this stage i knew what i was doing.</p>

              <p>Children in Singapore are generally much smarter than children in Australia, all thanks to our government enforced spoon-fed education.</p>
              <p>Discipline will need to be complement with morals, a child with morals will be able to understand the reason behind the necessary discipline inflicted upon them compared to a wild child without any morals.</p>
              <p>Education has nothing to do with a child's morals and discipline. The child will learn his/her own set of morals by mirroring the folks she/he came in contact with ... be it storybook characters, parents/relatives/siblings, role models such as teachers/tutors/people they look up to, new friends and friends they have known, their idols and crushes. These people will continue to contribute as an important factor and they affect the child's morals the most, unknowingly to them of course.</p>
              <p>I don't think there's a fixed pattern on how to educate a child, it really depends alot on the child's behaviour and personality. Parents who tried to impose the exact same form of discipline they had when they were a child, onto their own child ... will often find themselves failing in educating their own child.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans on the general, doesn't really know how to educate their own children. Maybe it's because we're from a rigid, hardened Asian culture and thanks to all the excessive but necessary spoon-feeding we all used to depend on since we were young, we are clueless, indecisive, and simply do not possess enough confidence to bring up our own children.</p>

              <p><br>Smarter as in more worldly-knowledgable. We were more exposed to the information around the world compared to proud countries that mainly focus their education on their own country.</p>
              <p>Australia education and media emphasis more on their own country and filter out most contents which isn't Australian.</p>
              <p>Ever wondered why majority of the people in the world believed Singapore is part of China and Singapore is just a small fishing village?</p>
              <p>It's not because Singapore aren't famous enough, it's because these proud countries are so intensely proud of their own heritage that they only educate their people with materials focused on their own countries.</p>
              <p>Thank GOD that Singapore Government doesn't follow the form of education, or else we will all be wearing tudung, carrying kris, worshipping Sang Nila Utama on our dollars and lion-spotting will be our national hobby/sport.</p>

              <p>yeah man. the locals are there are actually smarter people than overseas asian who go there to study. The locals find it harder to enter uni compared to the overseas students. But regular singapore students can get in becos of $$$ and singapore students there also tend to be more retard than student from China, India ect.</p>

              <p><br> Smarter as in more worldly-knowledgable. We were more exposed to
              the information around the world compared to proud countries
              that mainly focus their education on their own country.</p>
              <p>Australia education and media emphasis more on their own country
              and filter out most contents which isn't Australian.</p>
              <p>Ever wondered why majority of the people in the world believed
              Singapore is part of China and Singapore is just a small fishing
              village?</p>
              <p>It's not because Singapore aren't famous enough, it's because
              these proud countries are so intensely proud of their own heritage
              that they only educate their people with materials focused on their
              own countries.</p>
              <p>Thank GOD that Singapore Government doesn't follow the form of
              education, or else we will all be wearing tudung, carrying kris,
              worshipping Sang Nila Utama on our dollars and lion-spotting will
