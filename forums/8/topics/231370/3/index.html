It is meant to kill bacteria. Yes you do need to complete it so that at least the remnants of the bacteria population is almost controlled to a bare minimum.

As you grow older , you will find out that infections can still kill you especially antibiotic resistant ones. Some people becomes carriers ( meaning they don't exhibit symptoms) and some will become sick. Matter of lucky draw and the state of your immune system and the state of the bacteria infecting you.<br><br>People still do die of antibiotic resistant bacterial infections. Young and old. You willl only know how antibiotic resistant bacteria affect you when you are very ill. You will find that doctors will have to prescribe stronger antibiotics with more side effects if you become seriously ill and the bacteria that is causing the infection does not respond to antibiotics.<br><br>I remember the strongest antibiotics was vancomycin and gentamycin - they are given through the veins .   That meant having to do levels every 2-3 days just to make sure that it will not destroy the person's kidney while in the process of killing the bacteria. Linezoid is now the strongest for certain infections but it comes with even worse side effects. I think they monitor daily for liver and renal failure for those on linezoid infusions.  If all fails, you have to depend on your body. Most elderly do not survive such bad infections. They die.<br><br>So don't underestimate the humble bacteria who can wreck havoc on you.</div>
