            <div class='col-md body'>I understand your reservations simply because when i myself initially knew of such business opportunities, i (naturally) found myself asking almost all manner of questions to almost anybody around BUT instead not getting as much info as i wished !!<br><br>As for 'stuck-up' that's not my problem in this case, because that quite precisely also was the same sort of impressions i received from those Swiss people when i queried them as i myself is seriously interested in injecting ~ US$ 20000 into this business. My impressions is that they are so accustomed with dealing with amounts much larger than that so they really don't care if you don't invest with them since they already have least few others who are the big investors to keep them busy !!<br><br>I suppose they know that with so few other players around as good &amp; reliable as them that one would actually lose out by NOT investing with them that's why they can appear with 'stuck-up' impressions ?!?<br><br>These Swiss people may seem 'stuck-up' to Asians but contrary to what you wrote, they're surviving extremely well in the business ! The few who know them &amp; have been profitting reliably from their services of course would tend to keep this goldmine to themselves. Or offer it as 'their own' investment service to some others they're comfortable doing business with.<br><br>I'll put it it boils down to simply whether one's willing to risk trusting them least for once &amp; trying them out &amp; let the results show.

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree fantastic but non-guaranteed returns in derivatives can be achieved over very short time. I believe those Swiss brokers also (selectively though) do use such means to generate returns from some of the invested funds.<br><br>For me, as i'm still 'getting the feel' of FOREX trading via an FXCM account, for the moment almost 100 % of my investment funds would instead go into the '150 % ROI in 6 months' business where least i know from personal experiences there's demonstrated performance of the guaranteed profit returns i.e. i leave the actual investment part for the time being to the professionals &amp; they manage the account &amp; produce me their stated returns so that i &amp; all those who invested under me get our expected required returns.<br><br>In the future however i intend to split half my investment funds between my self managed FOREX trading &amp; the existing 'auto managed' investment services.
