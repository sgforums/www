            <div class='col-md body'>just wondering, why while it's not okay to think that one is pretty (being called vain etc) and it's even more uncool to say it out loud, it's alright to call oneself goody?  Is the goodiness standard used on par with the chiobuness standard used?  And is there any natural law that says chiobus cannot be good since there are so many good girls (at least self professed ones) and therefore the goodiness standard employed cannot be that high afterall?<br><br>------------------<br>Sex is not the answer.

But hope and reality sometimes make big contradictions...sometimes, you'd realise that chio is not really what you look for , but actually being comfortable with her and inner beauty and...insert desired values) etc.<br>But hey, isnt it true that most guys are attracted to the ger's look before they make an effort to get to know the inside character of her more? Might be called human basic instinct, but come on...this is a fact of life...life with contradictions<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>rememeber when we're still young, we guys will normally sit together and discuss what type of gals will attract us...most of us will wanna to find chio bu as our g/f, she must have good looks, good body, very sexy, but none express interest on the gals internal beauty!!! but strangley enough, as we grow older, more matured and working in the society, we tend to look out for inner beauty more than just wanting a chio bu!!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chiobu or nice character<br>I agree what attract most guys to a girl is the first impression and Looks. But ultimately for a wife.. they will go for someone with character(best if both looks n character larz)<br>Pretty pointless to go for a chiobu with no character. 20 years down the road... A bad character chiobu will be come a old wrinkled bad character lao char bor<br>while a girl with nice character will always keep the character there.<br><br>For me, all i want is just a nice girl with nice character, n pleasant looking..(no need too pretty.. i not bery yandaoz..)<br><br>------------------<br>To luf someone is nothing, to be luf by someone is something, to be luf by the one you luf is everything.....</div>
