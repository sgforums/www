            <div class='col-md body'>~Rinoa<br><br>Agreed. Everyone is puting up a front. No one really shows their true feelings. It is a defense mechanism. We are often hurt most by the people we are most honest with. Thus, we tend to keep our feelings to ourselves, hoping that no one can see through our disguise and inflict harm upon us.<br><br>The prospect of disappointment lends people the fear of opening themselves to others around them.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello Cherie darling...<br><br>let's see... I think that maybe 40% of the people would settle for chiobus in the end lar. Most guys would settle for nice and simple girls. If you dun belive me.. just go down to Orchard Road and see for yourself. Usually the people hanging out with the Chio Bus are the young pple.. aka teenagers. Then take a look at the married couples.. easy to spot them lar.. they dun dress as nicely as the other couples who are dating.. or they usually haf kids by their side. Sometimes the husband might be quite good looking.. but the wife.. ahem.. no comments.<br><br>And I totally agree with GoonDu.. Chemistry definitely matters!</div>
