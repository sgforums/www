            <div class='col-md body'>I kena sleep paralysis once.<br>Part 1. Was lying in my bed one night (sleeping duh) , then i realised i couldnt move.  My eyes were wide open (suddenly awoke) staring at the ceiling. I couldnt even make a sound.<br><br>Part 2.  Suddenly felt like i floated up from the bed, and floated to the opposite wall and back again onto the bed.<br><br>Part 1 is easily expained.  What happened was that I suddenly became conscious. But, the body isn't responding cos it, theoretically havent wake up yet.  So what happens is that I felt like as tho I was paralysed.<br><br>Now part 2 is, hallucination.  Different people have different ones, some will see ghost, some will have out of body experience. Me, i float... heck i guess i love flying too much.  The hallucination is usually relevant to childhood upbringing, like what ur parents tell u when u were young... the spooky stuf they used to frighten u with.  Used to think that ghosts would pop their heads out of walls. *growl*<br><br>The hallucination happens cos, well u suddenly became conscious.  Not every part of ur brain is actually conscious yet.  So when u realised u are paralysed, the subconscious part and the conscious part will kinda find a middle ground to explain thing, and u will start seeing things.<br><br>At least this is my way of explaining things.  If u ever kena again, just trying blinking at first.  Dont try to explain it and u wont hallucinate.  Well not that u can control that anyways... ha.<br><br>What u can do to TRY sleep paralysis.<br><br>Sleep in facing up, and dun move as u fall asleep.<br>Sudden increase level of stress.<br>messup ur sleepin habits<br><br>These are contributory factors to sleep paralysis.<br></div>
