The taxi driver should have stopped the meter and you pay him the amount shown on the meter.

            <div class='col-md body'>My complain letter. Wonder what kind of reply will I get from them. <blockquote>Monday, June 07, 2004<br><br>Traffic Police Department<br>10 Ubi Avenue 3<br>Singapore 408865<br><br>To Whom It May Concern:<br><br>Letter of complaint of taxi driver of SHB ****J<br><br>I would like to bring to your attention an encounter I had with a SMRT taxi driver of plate number SHB ****J.<br>I was sending one of my friends to her home at Serangoon Central when I met this driver along Upper Serangoon Road before Youngberg Terrace. The exact location would be the unopened Woodleigh MRT drop-off point, at around 11.45pm on June 6, 2004.<br>I was traveling from Jurong along PIE, exiting through the exit to Upper Serangoon Road. I recalled that I was traveling at 60km/h along Upper Serangoon Road; taking the left lane while SHB ****J was on the center lane on my right. When we were nearing the MRT drop-off point, SHB ****J suddenly steered into my lane without signaling to stop at the drop-off point. Apparently he had failed to checked his blind spot and we had resulted in an almost collusion. Fortunately, I was quick enough to stop my car in time without hitting the kerb or SHB ****J.<br>The reason why I am writing in is because I would like to highlight the consequences that could have resulted from the reckless driving of SHB****. And judging from the sudden turn of SHB ****J, it could have been a fatal one, should we have collided because I would have hit the female passenger seated in the back seat. Furthermore, there were three other passengers traveling in my car. My passengers and I suffered from a shock after the incident and although the driver did apologized, I felt that he is endangering the lives of other commuters on the road should he continue his reckless driving and not observing the rules.<br>Hence I hope the authorities could look into this matter and take appropriate actions to prevent such incident from happening. Should you require a detailed account of the incident, I could be reached at *******.<br><br>Yours Sincerely,<br><br>CC:<br><strong>Land Transport Authority                             </strong><br>460 Alexandra Road<br>#28-00 PSB Building<br>Singapore 119963<br><strong>SMRT Corporations</strong><br>Communications Department<br>60, Woodlands Industrial Park E4,<br>Singapore 757705<br><br></blockquote></div>
