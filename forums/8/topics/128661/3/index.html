But it's pretty shallow of you to label the girls as 'chio ones' who only flock to him. To me, you sound very stereotypish and girls can easily spot your selfishness if you continue being such a shallow person. The only trick is to change your attitude and stop being such an 'assh0le'. Want girls? speak to them first and please don't give your screwed-up face even if you approach an average-looking girl, because basically, you will give the impression that you are very childish and 'stupid'.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey..you're just 16 and you want girlfriend? Concentrate on ur studies..u 16 hor..this yr shd be ur O levels right?<br>I nt older than you in anyway lol. I'm only 17 this yr.<br><br>All humans get attracted by their opposite genders . ( not including gays and les) At your age, you will tend to like..take a few look at a chiobu, or saw a chio bu with a fat guy and think " wah lau, she got no taste sia..how i wish she was mine" etc etc etc.<br><br>Remember, gf/bf is = relationship/love. what you are experiencing now is more of a sexual desire, and not love. it's 2 very different things. It's like you saw a chiobu actress on TV, and you wish she was ur g/f, but you dont LOVE her. Get what I mean? It's the homos in humans body making you react like this.<br><br>you said u got no looks;charm;money..<br>as for looks and charm, just be yourself and be confident. dont care how ppl look at you. i also have no looks,with a mole above my upper left lips, when i walk pass people 99% surely turn their head and look at me, like i was some alien, and either giggle or find me disgusting. last time when i was 15 liddat, i very angry, and went home hitting the wall, venting my anger. but now i dont give a damn liao.<br><br>if i ugly, then y you look? they lame lor..especially those more pretty gals..<br><br>as for money..if a gal like you coz of your money, you want her?<br>if i were you, i'lll give her 2 words.. - FK OFF! -<br><br>anyway, you said that " money..parents poor".. i mean..you're already 16, and you still want your parents to feed you with money? go work la...my cousin sec 2 only, every sat and sun working at airport, those watch shop there.<br>her mother, my aunt, works there la..so got a little .. "help" in order to work there. if u nxt yr still asking ur parents for money, prepare to get slap..unless u are a pampered kid...<br><br>Anyway, last time i saw a science programme, saying that humans when lking for their other partner, they go for the opposite of their own. they say that a handsome guy will go for an average girl, while no looks guys get more attracted to chiobu. there's exception though.<br><br>but.. handsome guy go for average gal..gal happy like siao<br>no looks guy go for chiobu..chiobu siam like siao...<br><br></div>
