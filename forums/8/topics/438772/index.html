              <p>TS, I really think you are being quite naive.</p>
              <p>The question here isnt about whether you cleared the interview or not. It is about you applying for a job that doesn't exist at the moment.</p>
              <p>and on most employment terms, "keeping your application in view for 3 months" does not really mean anything. Its just a nicer way of saying 'no'.</p>
              <p>It is not a system of first-come-first-serve, that you will be prioritised over later/newer applicants. I suppose the vacancies for allied educators are very much limited, and I don't see why MOE will need to dig up the backlog of people on the waiting list, when there are so many fresh applicants eager to fill the post.</p>
              <p>TS, my suggestions to you:</p>
              <p>1) Go write in to any schools to be relief teacher/ teacher's assistant/ education associates/ contract teacher/ whatever. After working for a few months, then ask the principal to recommend you for training as teacher, or as allied educator if you still wish to be one.</p>
              <p>2) Reapply for the position every 3 months, to ensure that you are in the 'current list' instead of the waiting list.</p>
              <p>3) Give up and look for some other job.</p>

              <p>First-off, i emailed the person asking whether i did not clear my interview or was it because i was an unsuitable candidate. And then they told me that they couldnt find a school in th cluster that could match my strengths. I WAS NOT REJECTED. theres still hope, i just have to wait. </p>
              <p>Secondly, in case you havent been reading the news, Relief Teachers Scheme has changed, you need more than just 'O' Levels to be a Relief Teacher. Also,  a teacher's assistant = Allied Educator. And in case you are wondering, i do have experiences in the teaching industry, but due to competition, my chances of getting in is lower. </p>
              <p>Thirdly, thanks for all your advices, but i was asking for an enlightenment, not directions on what i should do with my life. </p>

              <p>Do some teaching related job in the meantime. Doesn't sound like a outright rejection letter nor is it trying to be polite. More like a "waiting list" letter. When they really call you, at least you'll be ready. If they don't....which could highly be a possibility because of the many applicants for this job....don't fret either. If your passion is really education, there are many opportunities in the private sector. Worse to worst, go overseas. There are jobs aplenty.</p>
              <p>Last thing you'll want is to get desperate over a job and think it's the world.</p>

              <p>Like seriously? Allied educators are those who are helping with students with special needs. You really need a lot of patience for this job.</p>
              <p>Anyways, take it from me, Allied educators are NOT teacher's helper. I working in a school so i kinda know these things.</p>
              <p>Allied Educators still have to go for course and what not. It is not easy job to get because they go background checks.</p>

              <p>WOW i actually thought people here would be kind and generous and offer serious advices. Instead, everyone tries to be a smart ass and make me feel like i wasted my time in trying to be a Teacher or its associate in my effort to pursue my passion. I was hoping somebody with a real experience prior to all this Crap talk would tell me honestly what that email means. Instead people who isnt even an Allied Educator, or actually has no idea what an AED is, tries to tell me what to do. THANKS EVERYBODY, this thread is indeed pointless. Cause seriously, all i see is people telling me what to do, when they have no clue what it really means. What a waste of my time, GOODBYE. aint coming back to this place, what a load of crap. So say what you want yeah, i aint gonna pay no bloody attention no more. </p>
              <p>OH and FYI, Allied Educator =/= teaching kids with special needs. DO YOUR RESEARCH YEAH. i said Allied Educator (Teaching and Learning), not Allied Educator (Counselling) or Allied Educator (Learning and Behaviorial Support). Hahaha, what the hell. Seriously. </p>
