I told him, "Nope, there's no one by that name here. We don't speak hokkien one. We're cantonese."<br><br>After that, I was treated to a very verbose apology.

            <div class='col-md body'>OK, this time it's for real &amp; it happened to me at around 12.00 am. It's funny yet weird!!!<br><br>"Hello, can u talk to me, i'm bored, i'm not satisfied!!"<br>'Ahh..yes, not satisfied with what? can i help u?'<br><br>And she proceeded to tell me her sex life in details &amp; even ask me about mine to the dot. (It's just too vulgar to describe it here). So i went along with it. Lasted about half an hr &amp; was cut short when her old man came back home. Never hear from her since then.<br>Wished i had the caller-ID so still waiting curiously for her to call again. Easier to strike 4-D than to received a gal-caller telling all this stuff. Or did she call any of u out there???<br><br>adrian: i didn't say i have her add.....<br><br>Sato: i'll welcome u too...........<br><br>[This message has been edited by ALLe (edited 25 February 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>depending on my mood actually... if i'm in a good mood, I'll tell the person he got the wrong number, and asked what number he called.<br><br>If i'm in a bad mood, I'll just say "wrong number" and hangup.<br><br>I'll hv quite different reactions if I'm in extremely foul mood... I wud either scold "f*** off, wrong number", or use a very down tone to politely say "wrong number", then hang up. So depend on the person's luck...    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Whens the end coming?
