            <div class='col-md body'>Last time when cameras were first invented people all say cameras are evil. Because they capture the image of people and thus suck you soul out of your body. Then when handphones come out, people say handphones are bad for you because they cause radiation and can cause brain tumours. So I wonder who's bright idea to put both together ah  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> on a side note ... my rich friend just bought the Nokia one with 1 MegaPixel wah so nice.<br><br>I think there's nothing that can be done with camera phones. Unless you take all the humans and brainwash them until they won't think perverse thoughts you can't do anything. You can limit camera phones or even ban them but people will find ways to work around the limit and they can always use alternate mediums. Like spy cams  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I think sometimes technology is advancing too fast for our people. Science and gadgets advance so fast but the people still so behind, thats why will think to misuse the technology. If the people were all more refined, then we wouldn't have this problem. But that is such wishful thinking. Now then I realize the world is not such a perfect place.</div>
