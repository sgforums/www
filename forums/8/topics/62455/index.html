            <div class='col-md body'>how can it be tat both provide the same program but different unis?<br>different unis usually provide different program<br><br>perhaps u should tell us more about the unis that each institution is providing program from and the duration..u know more details<br>so we can assess the situation better =)<br><br>when u look at the program u should probably look into the stuff u will be going to learn..find out more about those..and do the comparison from there instead of juz looking at what "Bachelor of Buiness(blah blah blah)"</div>

Management, Accounting &amp; Finance etc).<br><br>I can't say what's happening in SIC but in SIM, I would say that their strength would be the <span style="font-style: italic;">relatively</span> better facilities..Comparing within SIM itself, the lecturers and staff, they are much better in the fields (in terms of lecturer quality) of Economics, Management &amp; Finance than <span style="font-style: italic;">other subjects</span>...</div>

Degree is the same for all institutes SIM SIC or PSB.<br><br>Slight misconception down here, there are no definate 'textbooks' in the UOL program but 'Essential Reading Materials'. The materials that they're sending (it's actually UOL-LSE that's the one doing the sending) are "Study Guides" which are in no way a sub to the essential reading materials...They ship all the way from London...and are means of allowing the student to grasp the basic concept of wad to look out for in this sub..<br><br>UOL lecturers only fly in once per year from London to conduct Revision Workshops after the Mock Exams, which is another exclusive feature to SIM...<br>These exams are the closest thing u can ever get to a real UOL exam...</div>
