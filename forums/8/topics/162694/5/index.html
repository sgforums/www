            <div class='col-md body'>by the way, 4 more questions :<br><br>1) should i change the layout/design the cage every 2 - 3 weeks? because i scared later the hamster gets very bored. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>2) secondly, do hamsters sleep during the same time as humans? like 10 pm to 8 am or so?<br><br>3) is it healthy for the hamster if i just keep one? that is, i scared if i buy just 1 hamster, later it gets very lonely and depressed. but i've no intention of getting 2 or more. does anyone have just 1 hamster, alone?<br><br>4) should i put some block of wood/rubber duck in the cage for the hamster to saw it's teeth?<br><br>thanks!<br>nikar.</div>

Vitacraft fruit/nut/wildberries sticks allow hamsters to bite and chew their food. sometimes, when ur asleep, the hamster may bite the metal wires of the cage. u surely cannot sleep one.<br><br>side note : it is VERY important to allow hamsters to gnaw/chew on something. if you do not allow them to chew, the teeth can grow and pierce thru the gums and then... yes, the brain.</div>
