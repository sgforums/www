KNN! i think already want to puke! maybe it's because the hamsters eat mealworms every now and then that they get strange diseases? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><blockquote>get them really young and handle and play with them a lot.. so they will be accustomed to being handled and will not bite..</blockquote>but the pet shop(Pet Mart) got young ones meh? i thought almost all are like halfway through adult-hood already? not sure if i can trust the uncle leh.<br>later i say "can gimme very young baby dwarf hamster?"......then he give me some young adult hamster.<br><br>(alfagirl)<br><blockquote>then both females died ard 2.5 yrs old, both cos of skin disease..can see lump on e skin..like cancer or tumor like tat lo</blockquote>but how can they get such things? i mean, if you wash them everyday and give them healthy food, also cannot avoid such things meh? very scary leh.<br><br><blockquote>pls do not bathe them in water..they are terrified of them..(although they can swim in water) can be seen as after u really bathe them, they throw up and soon u can see much more feces and they tremble..use sand..they are more friendly..easier for u too...cos they can jus own time own target (OTOT) go in n out of e bathhouse</blockquote>another thing i don't understand.......no matter how good the sand is, how can it make the hamster clean? in the end, the dirt/fleas will still get on the hamster and worse still, some of the sand will get stuck between the fur.....ugh.<br><br>last thing.......the soft sand cost how much? like 1 KG == S$8? or more?(i'm talking about good quality one)<br><br>thanks!<br>nikar.<br><br></div>
