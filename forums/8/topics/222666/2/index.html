Some people in express also like that what.<br><br>Anddddd, in my school. There are [b]uncivilised barbarians</strong> everywhere. Every stream. Every class. Nabeh. Sibeh bth them.

Some Normal stream students are just playful and cannot be bothered about studies - not that they are stupid - some of them are very intelligent . I was from the Normal Stream and I had the motivation to go further and compete against those who stand in my way at University.<br><br>Now I am in a better shape than those express kids who used to laugh at my classmates and I. I can go anywhere now- UK/USA/Australia/Canada. I am in Australia now like another classmate who came from Normal Stream - she works for citigroup as a financial controller. How many Singaporean grads with Business Degree  want to be like her - easy to transfer between Singapore and Australia at any time - instead of being clerks ? People who used to laugh at me just because they come from express stream - now they are just overworked in Singapore, cannot go anywhere and earning far less than I do. So want to laugh now?<br><br>So you could look down on anyone but bear in mind, they can overtake you in no time especially if they have the drive and motivation to do so.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In my school, S/E streamed students dont usually mix closely with thr NA/T stream student, unless ish really close friend. In school work, I guess NA/T student dont usually seek help from the S/E peers because they doesn't know much people at the top. At Sec1, 2 and 3, it's traditionally very hard for a student to jump from NA/T to S/E or NA. Therefore, the social circle of friends usually lie between the boundaries of NA/T classes and S/E classes. At sec 3 if you are in NA/T, you fate is sealed; Chances of promoted to S/E or NA is as slim as a paper.<br><br>However, there are really some real some student in NA who really buck up hard. In competition, monthly commmon tests or exams they results even shocked the teachers; getting very very good grade. These are the few NA/T students who can kick the a*ses of S/E for some time and won back some faces that they truly deserved.<br><br>There is one friend of mine who I remember clearly, he's the top chemistry student in his school. He topped every tests, exams and assessment. btw, he's from NA, No S/E student dare to look down on him as he can proudly say," My knowledge of Chemistry has reached another higher level".</div>
