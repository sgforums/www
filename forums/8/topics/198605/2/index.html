            <div class='col-md body'>Always remember, while the interviewer is assessing you, you are likewise assessing the interviewer.<br><br>That will give you an idea of the office culture and how you will be treated should you be offered a position at that company.<br><br>Still, be fully aware that you are sitting on the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">candidate's side </span></strong>of the table. Continue to smile and present yourself well, even if your ego is at stake. Interviewers in some PR firms enjoy goading candidates just to see if they lose their temper.</div>

She was afraid and jealous. It would be a different story if the interviewer was male.<br><br>Next time, see if your interviewer is a male or female. If it's a female, before going in, you go toilet first, to mess up your hair and ruin your makeup. Try to look slightly ugly. Remember, the key is being un-threatening. If the interviewer is a male, remember to prune yourself up, and after you go in, cross your legs when you speak to him. Smile and gaze into his eyes.<br><br>This is common sense really.</div></blockquote>Mwahahahha. I believe he made some sense. My interviewer was old, with too much concealer ard her eyes and has age spots all over her face. And look at how arrogant and condescendg she was to me.<br><br>So, gals, if your interviewer is female, yeah, wear conservative clothes, minimal makeup. If it's a man, dress up more and smile more. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

They want to employ kar kia to follow instructions faithfully and not questioning. They want YOU to be their hands to do the dirty work while she use her mouth to tink of new ideas and leave the implementation details to you. And guess wat? She gets higher pay than you. So as you can see, use mouth earn more money than use hands  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
