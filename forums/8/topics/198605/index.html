If it's a female, before going in, you go toilet first, to mess up your hair and ruin your makeup. Try to look slightly ugly. Remember, the key is being un-threatening. If the interviewer is a male, remember to prune yourself up, and after you go in, cross your legs when you speak to him. Smile and gaze into his eyes.<br><br>This is common sense really.</div></blockquote>really if i am the male and chikopeh if the lady not my type no matter how good she present herself i not interets...will onlu make things worse for herself</div>
