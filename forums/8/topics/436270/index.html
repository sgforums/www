I'm sure since your co can hire malaysian WPs, then PRCs shouldnt be a problem<br>actually foreign worker the cost also about the same as locals.. substitute the levy for CPF and the cost is about there liao<br><br>also, why you need to settle fine for him? the summon is addressed to him right? if not, then dock his pay, if theres any left</p></div>

              <p>Ai yah, don't reason out by yourself.</p>
              <p>Smoking in a banned place is an offence fine up to $1000. NEA offer $200 to compound the offence, so less work preparing the case and no need to attend court. Not easy for the NEA also to attend court.  If you worker don't take offer. Then must attend court and answer to charge of smoking. Failure to turn up for court case, is an arrestable offence. The offence now becomes 1) Failure to attend court,  2) Smoking in prohibited places. So tell him just pay $200 and everything clear, otherwise the case will get bigger.</p>
              <p>All this is none of your problem. So you can <em>chap siow</em> that bugger. The best you can do is advise him not to be foolish.</p>
              <p>If he is as you say he is, then let him be<em>.</em> Don't give a damn. Nothing will happen to you. His problem won't be passed to you.</p>
