            <div class='col-md body'>The thing is, our media is terribly screwed up. How so? Look, most of the newspaper are full of tabloid news..pick up a copy of the NewPaper, Wan Bao, Xin Min or whatever, and you'll realize that more often than not, the headlines are full of 'attention-grabbing', tabloid news..<br><br>To cite a recent example, don't you guys feel that for the recent HC guy-beat-the-busdriver incident, there was an over emphasis on the school which the guy came from? Was there such a need?<br><br>Unfortunately, tablod news sell..In a way, we have ourselves to blame for continuing to support such behavior.
