            <div class='col-md body'>Singaporean arrested in US over $4.8m arms deal<br>By Ansley Ng, TODAY<br><br>A Singaporean businessman has been charged in the United States for trying to buy hundreds of machine guns, handguns, fighter jet missiles and radar equipment, allegedly to be exported to Indonesia through Singapore.<br><br>Ibrahim Bin Amran, 46, and three other men are expected to be tried in a court in Detroit, Michigan, for attempting to purchase 245 Sidewinder missiles for military aircraft, 882 Heckler &amp; Koch (H&amp;K) MP5 submachine guns, 800 H&amp;K 9mm handguns, 16 H&amp;K sniper rifles and 5,000 rounds of ammunition from an arms company.<br><br>The US$3-million ($4.84-million) deal was stopped when agents from the US Homeland Security Department and Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested the men on Sunday in Hawaii while they were on the way to inspect aircraft parts.<br><br>Those arrested with Ibrahim are Indonesians Hadianto Djoko Djuliarso, 41, and Ignatius Ferdinandus Soeharli, and Briton David Beecroft.<br><br>"We consider this to be a serious and grave threat to our national security," said US Attorney Stephen Murphy yesterday.<br><br>"The agencies involved in the case worked hard to arrest individuals who were ready, willing and able to buy American weapons and take them outside the country."<br><br>American officials added that the case did not involve any plot to use the weapons for terrorism. Ironically, it is believed that it was the unnamed American arms company, which the men have been wooing for a year, which set the authorities on them.<br><br>On Friday, undercover federal agents, posing as company salesmen, met the men at Hawaii's Honolulu airport. The next day, the agents took them to inspect the weapons.<br><br>Two of the men were said to have been travelling with their wives.<br><br>The four men, who face up to 25 years in prison, were charged with conspiring to violate the US Arms Export Control Act.<br><br>Hadianto and Ibrahim were also slapped with money laundering charges.<br><br>According to court documents, the deal was spawned in April last year when an employee of Indodial - a Jakarta-based aircraft spare parts company set up by Ibrahim and Hadianto - contacted an American company seeking to buy military aircraft parts for export to Indonesia.<br><br>In June, Ibrahim met officials from the weapons firm in London to discuss the deal.<br><br>At another meeting in December, which was held in Detroit, the men offered US$3.3 million for the arms and said they would buy them even though they didn't have the proper export licence. Hadianto also urged that the deal be kept a secret, court papers showed.<br><br>On March 30, the pair sent US$447,000 to the company as a partial payment.<br><br>During an indictment hearing in Detroit on Tuesday, Ignatius was identified as the one who provided the cash, while Beecroft, who lives in Singapore, was tasked to arrange the shipment of the arms to Indonesia.<br><br>Other than Indodial, Ibrahim and Hardianto also own three other companies -PBJV Global, Eaststar Logistics and Etaru Indonesia - all based in or doing business in Singapore and Indonesia.<br><br>Hadianto's role in the deal is unclear but according to an employee at PBJV Global - Ibrahim's Singapore-registered oil and gas spare-parts company - the two men are business partners and frequently meet to discuss their "aircraft spare-parts business".<br><br>Beecroft is also no stranger to Ibrahim's company. He is hired as a freelance salesperson for PBJV Global's, a company official told TODAY.<br><br>Last Thursday, Ibrahim, who frequently travels to Indonesia on business, left Singapore for Hawaii, telling his employee at PBJV Global that he was going to meet a US contact to discuss buying new products for the company.<br><br>He was supposed to return to work at his Jalan Sultan office today, said the employee. His wife, known to his staff as "Ani", is believed to have been with him at time of arrest. The couple have no children and live in an HDB flat in Bishan.<br><br>The employee said he did not notice anything "unusual" about Ibrahim's last trip to the US, adding that he was "shocked" that his workplace could be the heart of an international arms smuggling operation.<br><br>"He is a very understanding and flexible employer," he said. "He doesn't look like he would even know how to handle a gun."<br><br>The men are currently being held in Hawaii and will be taken to Detroit to answer charges. Authorities in both states could not be reached for comment.<br>TODAY/ra</div>
