Or keep those notes for their friends. dispite the fact that the lecturer said there'll be another copy for the latecomers.<br>3) Selfish and useless - because they 'share' assignment code and plagarise balantly on reports and source codes.<br><br>Can you imagine these are the people who are taking post graduate programmes?<br><br>I was so happy when the lecturer announced 80% failure rate for assignment results. Coz after the mayhem, because non of them qualified to attend the final exams.<br><br>Don't get me wrong. Melbourne/Vic is a nice place to be.
