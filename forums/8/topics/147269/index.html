Yes it was termed the golden decade. The US Economy was good and that affected Singapore<br><br>After 1992 the booming of the US stock market<br>Internet revolution<br>Invention of the pentium chip<br>New industries and markets due to technological advances<br>Dot-com boom<br><br>We had a few years where we thought we could grow at enormous paces and with enormous productivity -- it was a new paradigm , a emerging one. But history had shown that following a period of  postitive high economic  activity, a negative one will follow which is in the 2000s<br><br>But that's not to say that the boom of the '90s will lead to a crash in the '00s like the boom of the '20s led to the depression of the '30s. it depends on a myriad of factors as well.<br><br>It is always  during a growth period , life on societal level will be portrayed postiviely as in the case of Singapore in the 90s. More people could afford to driv cars and afford better education.</div>

Glamour is from the inside. The postive economic conditions of the 90s had a different effect on the mindsets of the people. Priorities shifted to standard of living , fashion trends, expensive goods reflecting the economic health ect. Much like what u find in developing or developed countries.<br><br></div>

In those days it was we didnt need to worry about finances if we splurge on these goods. Even the HDB dwellers were into owning these things<br><br>If u believe in 1990s working during vacation period was considered glamourous for most teens as a way of earning expereince,  buying branded stuff ect. and not as a means of dog's life survival like now the 2000s. This is an example of a "glamourous attitude" towards life. U sidetrack from the intended motive and expand it<br><br></div>

Let's say the economy is stable forever, society will evolve and give rise to new ideas , thinking ect . Whether it is + or - depends on the society.

All Singaporean kenna rob blindly by the gahmen... Even the charity sector rob us blind... misleading us to thinking that our money were used for the less fortunate but in the end... a gold plated tap (which was replaced shortly) and high paid for its employees... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Those good old days are no longer available now. We should look forward towards the future and not backward. In this economy, those who do not change or adapt fast enuff face retrenchment and outcast from the new economy. It is a cruel but realistic world out there. I am so unfortunately to be caught in this downturn period so wat can I do? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When they 1st told our Ah Gongs and Ah Mas... If our grand parents work hard enough... Singapore would become a 'better' place... Living standard would go up and people would be 'rewarded'...<br><br>But today... They tell you in order for you to be 'rewarded'... You'll have to contribute.... Living standard HAS INDEED GONE UP... But are you gonna be there..? Part of it...?<br><br>People might not be 'smart' but they ain't no STUPID....<br><br>They are ENJOYING their lives now... DIE and get the F*CK out of this STUPID PLACE... ONLY those with MUCH HIGHER 'STANDARDS' are really having children... In the 'HOPE' that they can still manage to raise good 'elites'... The others are mainly those who doesn't care about their children; can't help with having children; or those who 'blindly believe' that they can provide well for their children...<br><br>But SERIOUSLY... With the CURRENT SITUATION? The 'NEXT GENERATION' would probably ONLY DOWNSIZE FURTHER... With dependency LARGELY on FOREIGNERS... And a 'HEAD BANG' effect as the 'scheme' is REPEATED among 'elites'... Just LOOK AT CHINA and you'll get the 'idea'... Just that Singapore's a DOWNSIZE VERSION of it... In other words, you'll get LESS ROOMS to BREATHE....<br><br>UNLESS a NEW FORM of RULING MINDSET is INSTALLED... "Competition is always healthy"...? MY FOOT... Pls DO STAY to watch YOUR OWN FUNERAL...<br><br><strong>NO POINT TALKING MUCH NOW... CHANGE IS OFTEN PAINFUL, BUT SOMETIMES IT JUST HAS TO HAPPEN....</strong><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the change is because life has changed. It used to be a big deal wearing branded goods. Now everybody is wearing them. So no more glamour.<br><br>Same as education. Going to university and pursuing a Bachelor was a big deal in the past. Now, not anymore. Even a Master is so common. Now people go for PhD. I think not long from now, even PhDs are no longer a big deal.</div>
