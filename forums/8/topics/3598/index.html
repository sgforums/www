            <div class='col-md body'>there are several kinds of gers i've come across. and this is not an exhaustive list cos i'm too tired right now to think of any more. but gers come in at least the following colourful varieties that you can find in your neighbourhood convenience store:<br><br>a) the like-you-very-obvious one: this type of ger sends out clear signals, clearer than 98.7FM signals on a clear cloudless day. if they like you, they will drop little messages and notes or say things like: "ohh, i just got home, and i'm thinking of you and i miss you. call me soon kay?" they name their pet dog or stuffed toy/teddy bear after you. they get all gooey and mushy ard you. and they laff at things you say which weren't even meant to be funny.<br><br>if you (as a hot-blooded male) miss this kind of signal, it could mean one of three things:<br><br>1. your transmission is very poor (i.e. your IQ is a single digit and you have the social skills of an amoeba).<br><br>2. your destiny is to be a monk. that is your calling in life. you belong in the monastery and at roll call this morning, they were missing someone. quick! if you start running now you'll make it back by supper time.<br><br>3. you are gay.<br><br>b) the dun-like-you-but-want-you-to-chase-them-anyway kind: if you know what's good for you, stay away from this kind of ger. they are like little alien life-forms waiting to absorb every guy in sight to feed their own insatiable egos. they only want the attention, and anyone will do. yes, even you.<br><br>c) the send-mixed-signals kinda ger: this is by far the biggest and most common group. sometimes these gers just donch want to hurt your feelings. sometimes they themselves are not sure what they want. so they will, on the one hand, tell you things like they wish they could talk to all guys as comfortably as they can talk to you. they may even hint that they are looking for a guy just like you. they will say they find you appealing and attractive. then they will tell you they are not looking for a r'ship right now. now, i may be totally off course, but if some gers think that this is playing hard to get, what is hard to get is their message and their intention. THEY are not what is hard to get, it's what on earth they're up to that is hard to get. the thing then is this: if you have a guy who listens more to the EXPLICIT words than all the rest you've hinted to him, he will leave you alone. of cuz in such a case the ger may really not like the guy in that way or like him (using the dreaded, consolatory but ultimately meaningless phrase) "only as a friend". girls have to understand one thing. guys are more often than not very one-dimensional. if they are not monks-by-nature or "happy"-by-nature (as i suggested above), then if a guy wants to spend lots of time with you, he prob likes you (in some vague, indefinable way). then the rest is up to you. a lot of gers are afraid the friendship will be lost if they reject the guy outright. but just as vonda shepard asked us not to break her heart slow, you are not doing the guy any favours by "acting blur". you tell or hint strongly at the guy if you dun like him or if he has more of a chance getting a date from cindy crawford. if you lose a fren, then you do. it's up to him, not you. he might take a while to recover but that's only natural. if he can be "frens" wif you again after that, all the good for it (since gers seem to like to have many such "frens"). if he can't take it, then telling him early would save more heartache than later (when he would have had more time to like you). so if you're a "fren" at all, do the "fren-like" thing and tell him. it may hurt in the short term, but it'll save more pain in the long term.<br><br>but if you like the guy, then for heaven's sake increase the favourable signals and decrease the unfavourable ones. only then can the guy know whether to act or when to act. many guys are delusional. they can ignore the clear unfavourable signals and play up the few "favourable" ones. but if they do this, it may well be cos your signals are still too mixed. remember, many guys are one-dimensional. so your signals must be one-dimensional too. anything vague can lead to either him giving up too early (when you actually like him) or make him stalk you for life (when you obviously detest him). if he gives up too early (and this is esp true of the shy guys) it does neither of you any good. if he stalks you, then only the new paper benefits cos they get to interview you and put your story on the front page.<br><br>moral of the story? clarity is what you should aim for. if you get irritated at lousy reception on the radio, then you can imagine how irritated guys feel at lousy reception and mixed signals from some of the gers out there.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, Ray,<br><br>After reading your postings, I am really impressed by your classification. My classification is much simpler, just based on 4 simple classes :<br><br>1)Woman who don't understand and accept you<br>The bimbos and women who think highly of themselves belong to this class.<br><br>2)Woman who understand and don't accept you<br>You can hit it off with this gal and then when you tell her that you liked her, she tells u that she has someone in mind. This kind of women are always the nice gals.<br><br>3)Woman who can't understand but can accept you.<br>She gets into a r/s with you and realize that you are not the One... Then it is a disaster.<br><br>4)Woman who can understand and accept you<br>The woman who has all it takes to be your gf and subsequently your wife. She will have the perfect chemistry you need. As Qwerty once put it to me over lunch in a restaurant, he said,"He is not looking for the Two, Three or  Four, but he is looking for the One." and in the words of the Highlander movie,"There can only be One".....<br><br>How are you doing, Ray?<br><br>Have a good day.<br><br>yours sincerely,<br>The Prodigal<br><br>------------------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ray:</div><div class="quote_body">there are several kinds of gers i've come across. and this is not an exhaustive list cos i'm too tired right now to think of any more. but gers come in at least the following colourful varieties that you can find in your neighbourhood convenience store:<br><br>a) the like-you-very-obvious one: this type of ger sends out clear signals, clearer than 98.7FM signals on a clear cloudless day. if they like you, they will drop little messages and notes or say things like: "ohh, i just got home, and i'm thinking of you and i miss you. call me soon kay?" they name their pet dog or stuffed toy/teddy bear after you. they get all gooey and mushy ard you. and they laff at things you say which weren't even meant to be funny.<br><br>if you (as a hot-blooded male) miss this kind of signal, it could mean one of three things:<br><br>1. your transmission is very poor (i.e. your IQ is a single digit and you have the social skills of an amoeba).<br><br>2. your destiny is to be a monk. that is your calling in life. you belong in the monastery and at roll call this morning, they were missing someone. quick! if you start running now you'll make it back by supper time.<br><br>3. you are gay.<br><br>b) the dun-like-you-but-want-you-to-chase-them-anyway kind: if you know what's good for you, stay away from this kind of ger. they are like little alien life-forms waiting to absorb every guy in sight to feed their own insatiable egos. they only want the attention, and anyone will do. yes, even you.<br><br>c) the send-mixed-signals kinda ger: this is by far the biggest and most common group. sometimes these gers just donch want to hurt your feelings. sometimes they themselves are not sure what they want. so they will, on the one hand, tell you things like they wish they could talk to all guys as comfortably as they can talk to you. they may even hint that they are looking for a guy just like you. they will say they find you appealing and attractive. then they will tell you they are not looking for a r'ship right now. now, i may be totally off course, but if some gers think that this is playing hard to get, what is hard to get is their message and their intention. THEY are not what is hard to get, it's what on earth they're up to that is hard to get. the thing then is this: if you have a guy who listens more to the EXPLICIT words than all the rest you've hinted to him, he will leave you alone. of cuz in such a case the ger may really not like the guy in that way or like him (using the dreaded, consolatory but ultimately meaningless phrase) "only as a friend". girls have to understand one thing. guys are more often than not very one-dimensional. if they are not monks-by-nature or "happy"-by-nature (as i suggested above), then if a guy wants to spend lots of time with you, he prob likes you (in some vague, indefinable way). then the rest is up to you. a lot of gers are afraid the friendship will be lost if they reject the guy outright. but just as vonda shepard asked us not to break her heart slow, you are not doing the guy any favours by "acting blur". you tell or hint strongly at the guy if you dun like him or if he has more of a chance getting a date from cindy crawford. if you lose a fren, then you do. it's up to him, not you. he might take a while to recover but that's only natural. if he can be "frens" wif you again after that, all the good for it (since gers seem to like to have many such "frens"). if he can't take it, then telling him early would save more heartache than later (when he would have had more time to like you). so if you're a "fren" at all, do the "fren-like" thing and tell him. it may hurt in the short term, but it'll save more pain in the long term.<br><br>but if you like the guy, then for heaven's sake increase the favourable signals and decrease the unfavourable ones. only then can the guy know whether to act or when to act. many guys are delusional. they can ignore the clear unfavourable signals and play up the few "favourable" ones. but if they do this, it may well be cos your signals are still too mixed. remember, many guys are one-dimensional. so your signals must be one-dimensional too. anything vague can lead to either him giving up too early (when you actually like him) or make him stalk you for life (when you obviously detest him). if he gives up too early (and this is esp true of the shy guys) it does neither of you any good. if he stalks you, then only the new paper benefits cos they get to interview you and put your story on the front page.<br><br>moral of the story? clarity is what you should aim for. if you get irritated at lousy reception on the radio, then you can imagine how irritated guys feel at lousy reception and mixed signals from some of the gers out there.<br><br></div></blockquote>Cheerio to you Ray  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> ,<br>extremely well said, you seems to have nail every possible reasons why girls are auto or not.  ~HIGH FIVE MAN~<br><br>As for me<br><br>Auto = modern gals<br>Not auto = traditional gals<br><br>I would prefer the not auto gals cause more simpler, easier to maintain......hehehhe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Nothing can't be done, unless you don't want to</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't quite agree lor... Girls who make the first move and gets rejected doesn't necessarily gets branded as 'cheap' or 'slut' -- more often it'll be due to the way they ask.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think that the thinking that girls who make the 1st move are branded cheap,slut etc etc are just their own mind playing tricks on them as i am sure that if a girl makes the 1st move,guys will normally won't think of such a girl as a slut etc etc unless she blatantly says it in such a way as to lack sincerity.for guys(at least for me)if a girl makes the 1st move,i be more surprise at her guts than anything else  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">)))</div>
