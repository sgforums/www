            <div class='col-md body'>God's unveiling plan for us, maybe analogized to the form of an unfolding 5 part drama.<br>1st part: Creation (God makes the universe, amd this world and everything in it)<br>2nd part: Man, the creation of God, falls to the temptation of Sin.<br>3rd part: God chooses Israel, so that they may follow His Laws and become a light to the rest of the nations, exemplifying what it means to be 'holy' or rather set apart, living as a people of God, so that ALL nations will, through the actions of this Israelite nation, be drawn to return to God.<br>4th part: Israel fails in its mission, instead choosing to be seduced to the temptation of using the 'obedience' to God's Law to rank themselves against each other, to see who was holier than thou. God sends Jesus as a result. To fulfil what Israel could not, and that through Him, all nations will truly be saved.<br>5th Part: After Jesus' Crucifixion, Death, Resurrection and Ascension, He gives the Holy Spirit to the Church. the Church is the new Israel, serving the function of obedience to the ways of God, to the truth of God, that through them, all people will know what it is like to live under God's rule, instead of sin's rule.<br><br>Therefore, as the body of Christ, we have a duty to fulfil unto all the nations.<br>Not just to preach when they invite us to.<br>But even when they don't invite us to preach.<br>Remember that our comission is given by God, and not by mankind.<br>The urgency is there.<br>People are dying everyday.<br>Even young people have no guarantee of tomorrow, we know that for a fact.<br>So it is urgent.<br>And it is a MUST.<br>It is even BIBLICAL.<br>Preach with gusto, with urgency, with faithfulness to the Message of God.<br>the Church is meant to be the light of the world, the salt of the earth, and a city on a hill, one that cannot remain hidden.<br><br>wat i am saying here is that:<br>ideas, such as that of claiming that you will preach only to people who r willing to listen is WRONG.<br>it is the sin of APATHY.<br>many times, people talk the rubbish they do, because they never ever knew the Message of God.<br>they do not realise that they hv colored their own visions of God to such an extent, whereby God must be 'appealing' to them to get them to believe.<br>they think that it is a popularity contest.<br>what is TRUE, matters not to them.<br>they only like what suits their ears.<br>think about it.<br>they judge the Church, becos they believe the Church must suit them.<br>they do not stop to think that when they go to sch, they comply with the rules of the place.<br>similarly, this whole big world, is like God's school for us.<br>and what are we trying to do then, by setting our own rules?<br><br>truth is, God doesnt need their votes.<br>whether they like it or not, He reigns,<br>the aim of evangelism, is not even our own souls (for what merit is there to be claimed?) but their own souls themselves.</div>
