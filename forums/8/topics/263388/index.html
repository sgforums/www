            <div class='col-md body'>This may be controversial, but it is the truth anyway. There are many sadists round the globe, and as you can see, you, who is reading this, are likely to be one of them.<br><br>So what is a sadist? No explanation needed here. Even an uneducated chap will easily spot one in the workplace or governmental institution. Characteristics of a sadist:<br><br>1.Likes to control and manipulate people<br>2.ALways use their senority to make use of people 'below'<br>3.Uses authority to make others feel INFERIOR<br>4.Alwys uses hard language or tekan language, their tongues are sharper than a snake<br>5.Think they own the workplace, play the role of 'captain'<br>6.Carry balls, please the boss, as the boss is their GOD<br><br>Sadists have mental problems, this is the truth, they are often so intelligent that they are abnormal people, many people, in social hierachy, hate them. Why are they abnormal? They are obsessed with their reputation, and will always punish and growl at others like a poor dog, just to maintain their 'senority'. Outwardly they are powerful, charismatic and get along well with bigshots, but deep inside they are loners.<br><br>I agree that the sadists you have in mind may be neccessary to maintain discipline, for when there is no discipline there is chaos. But the sadists I am refering to, is the evil people who likes to manipulate people 'under' them. They think that as long as you depend on them, you are their 'slaves'. Outwardly they treat you well and manipulate you. BUT DEEP DOWN IN THEIR HEARTS YOU ARE A USEFUL DOG, OR AKA SLAVE. Yes, you can find them in from BMT, to schools, to workplace, to instructors, and maybe your home! There is just so many sadists, from people who reply rudely to others in forums, insulting others, to internet trolls, to public places, and so on.<br><br>The truth is, they are all cowards. This is the truth. Outwardly they always show their efficiency and ferocity, but they are like a crab when real trouble comes. They will blame other people. They are BLAMELESS, OTHER PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS WRONG. THEY WILL NEVER SAY SORRY TO 'INFERIOR PEOPLE' AND PEOPLE THEY SCOLDED.<br><br>Now I will tell you the secret why people become sadists, or you often call them f**kers and b*tches in your casual conversations with other collegues. I don't play the game of 'psychologist' but one phrase is enough: they were not taught MORAL values when they are young. There is no point in talking about bio-socio-cultural model, or their abnormal EQ.<br><br>Another secret. Money (and pleasure), and comfort is SO important to them, that it becomes abnormal. They always say others are lazy, but they themselves ARE AS LAZY, and more lazy. If they don't have education, they would have became thieves and successful conman. Because money is more important to them than your 'un-useful' existence.<br><br>There are many degrees of sadism; most people are mild to moderate sadists. And very few good peolpe exists.<br><br></div>
