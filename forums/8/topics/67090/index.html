So a non-JC student is definitely not 1 level below others.<br><br>But going to JC will leave you more choices.  After your A level, you can still choose to:<br>1) Go NUS/NTU/SMU<br>2) Go Poly<br>3) Go overseas.<br><br>For those who choose not to go JC, they will not have choice no. 1 listed above.  Though Poly students can eventually go to the local uni, it is restricted to only the top 5%.  This is more difficult than going to uni via A level.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, been thru all the years of education system, I really have to frown upon SG antiquated education system<br><br><strong>Subjects are rather lame, and although they emphasise creativity nowadays, are they really?</strong> I love history, but I hate the way they teach history in schools. More on memorising, than analysing, gaining more knowledge, or appreciating the circumstances or impact of history on us. Most of the time, I just trudged down to library or bookstores rather than listening to my teachers. For my friends who took NE in schools or university now, they told me one thing. Lame.  Mostly, I appreciate history thru self study, than sitting in old boring classrooms trying to pass exams.<br><br><strong>Sure we may have the best smartest school going kids nowadays ,but are these people end up contributing more to Singapore society?</strong> Someone posted here on sgforums why LKY feel clever people are not accepted into PAP, and why highly educated people are not contributing to SG society. I dont mean just economic contributions, I also mean personal development, philosophical, poltical, cultural aspects...........Most people in this forum have already express worries over educated Singaporeans working for themselves and not caring enough for others.<br><br><strong>Is our education system also relevant to our changing world today? </strong>Once my friend remarked, professors who do not have working experience outside are teaching students to be successful in business. I was like, damn right he is.<br><br>Many of us are living in our dreamland, where we assume and resume the tradiitonal route our ancestors have ploughed for us. Look, these ways of thinking are olden, and we live in a new age, where terrorist are the mainstay of political problems, people are losing job faster than you can say "Fire", and internet is our way of communication now!!!<br><br>Keke, even our ancestors know that to survive in this world, you must be able to think and move fast. Why do you think they come to Singapore to seek better life? Why would they also start biz? Why is it for them to know its good to be deep rooted in our own culture than to readily adopt Western ones?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>poly students who eventuallly go uni in fact have an easier time than students who come from jc, cos they have some foundation in the courses that they study<br><br>i also believe that poly students bring with them practical knowledge, experience and a sense of daring into the uni... however i must also say that most jc students have admirable brain power when it comes to studying... not just in the sense of mugging, but also that some of them are damn analytical..<br><br>if you could have gone to a jc but chose to enter poly, what makes u think that it is harder to enter uni?? ur brains don't change and if u work hard enough, it isn't that difficult in gaining admission... in this sense, i prefer to think of poly as a stepping stone and foundation to a degree course<br><br>however, i must say that scholarships open to poly students are somewhat limited....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br></div>
