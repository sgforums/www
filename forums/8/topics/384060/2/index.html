              <p><span style="font-size: 100%;">There are many things that I can 
              doubt, but I cannot doubt my own consciousness in this moment. My 
              consciousness IS, and even if I tried to doubt it, it would be my 
              consciousness doubting. I can imagine that my senses are being presented
               with a fake reality – say, a completely virtual reality or digital 
              reality, which looks real but is merely a series of extremely realist 
              images. But even then, I cannot doubt the consciousness that is doing 
              the watching…<br><br>The very undeniability of my present awareness, the
               undeniability of my consciousness, immediately delivers to me a 
              certainty of existence in this moment, a certainty of Being in the 
              now-ness of this moment. I cannot doubt consciousness and Being in this 
              moment, for it is the ground of all knowing, all seeing, all existing…<br><br>Who
               am I? Ask that question over and over again, deeply. Who am I? What is 
              it in me that is conscious of everything?<br><br>If you think that you 
              know Spirit, or if you think you don’t, Spirit is actually that which is
               thinking both of those thoughts. So you can doubt the objects of 
              consciousness, but you can never believably doubt the doubter, never 
              really doubt the Witness of the entire display. Therefore, rest in the 
              Witness, whether it is thinking that it knows God or not, and that 
              witnessing, that undeniable immediacy of now-consciousness, is itself 
              God, Spirit, Buddha-mind. The certainty lies in the pure self-felt 
              Consciousness to which objects appear, not in the objects themselves. 
              You will never, never, never see God, because God is the Seer, not any 
              finite, mortal, bounded object that can be seen…<br><br>This pure I AM 
              state is not hard to achieve but impossible to escape, because it is 
              ever present and can never really be doubted. You can never run from 
              Spirit, because Spirit is the Runner. To put it very bluntly, Spirit is 
              not hard to find but impossible to avoid: it is that which is looking at
               this page right now. Can’t you feel That One? Why on earth do you keep 
              looking for God when God is actually the Looker?<br><br>Simply ask, Who 
              am I? Who am I? Who am I?<br><br>I am aware of my feelings, so I am not 
              my feelings – Who am I? I am aware of my thoughts, so I am not my 
              thoughts – Who am I? Clouds float by in the sky, thoughts float by in 
              the mind, feelings float by in the body – and I am none of those because
               I can Witness them all.<br><br>Moreover, I can doubt that clouds exist,
               I can doubt that feelings exist, I can doubt that objects of thought 
              exist – but I cannot doubt that the Witness exists in this moment, 
              because the Witness would still be there to witness the doubt.<br><br>I 
              am not objects in nature, not feelings in the body, not thoughts in the 
              mind, for I can Witness them all. I am that Witness – a vast, spacious, 
              empty, clear, pure, transparent Openness that impartially notices all 
              that arises, as a mirror spontaneously reflects all its objects…<br><br>You
               can already feel some of this Great Liberation in that, as you rest in 
              the ease of witnessing this moment, you already feel that you are free 
              from the suffocating constriction of mere objects, mere feelings, mere 
              thoughts – they all come and go, but you are that vast, free, empty, 
              open Witness of them all, untouched by their torments and tortures.<br><br>This
               is actually the profound discovery of… the pure divine Self, the 
              formless Witness, causal nothingness, the vast Emptiness in which the 
              entire world arises, stays a bit, and passes. And you are That. You are 
              not the body, not the ego, not nature, not thoughts, not this, not that –
               you are a vast Emptiness, Freedom, Release, and Liberation.<br><br>With
               this discovery… you are halfway home. You have disidentified from any 
              and all finite objects; you rest as infinite Consciousness. You are 
              free, open, empty, clear, radiant, released, liberated, exalted, 
              drenched in a blissful emptiness that exists prior to space, prior to 
              time, prior to tears and terror, prior to pain and mortality and 
              suffering and death. You have found the great Unborn, the vast Abyss, 
              the unqualifiable Ground of all that is, and all that was, and all that 
              ever shall be.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">But why is that 
              only halfway home? </span>Because as you rest in the infinite ease of 
              consciousness, spontaneously aware of all that is arising, there will 
              soon enough come the great catastrophe of Freedom and Fullness: the 
              Witness itself will disappear entirely, and instead of witnessing the 
              sky, you are the sky; instead of touching the earth, you are the earth; 
              instead of hearing the thunder, you are the thunder. You and the entire 
              Kosmos because One Taste – you can drink the Pacific Ocean in a single 
              gulp, hold Mt. Everest in the palm of your hand; supernovas swirl in 
              your heart and the solar system replaces your head…<br><br>You are One 
              Taste, the empty mirror that is one with any and all objects that arise 
              in its embrace, a mindlessly vast translucent expanse: infinite, 
              eternal, radiant beyond release. And you… are… That…<br><br>So the 
              primary Cartesian dualism – which is simply the dualism between… in here
               and out there, subject and object, the empty Witness and all things 
              witnessed – is finally undone and overcome in nondual One Taste. Once 
              you actually and fully contact the Witness, then – and only then – can 
              it be transcended into radical Nonduality, and halfway home becomes 
              fully home, here in the ever-present wonder of what is…<br><br>And so 
              how do you know that you have finally and really overcome the Cartesian 
              dualism? Very simple: if you really overcome the Cartesian dualism, then
               you no longer feel that you are on this side of your face looking at 
              the world out there. There is only the world, and you are all of that; 
              you actually feel that you are one with everything that is arising 
              moment to moment. You are not merely on this side of your face looking 
              out there. “In here” and “out there” have become One Taste with a 
              shuddering obviousness and certainty so profound it feels like a 
              five-ton rock just dropped on your head. It is, shall we say, a feeling 
              hard to miss.<br><br>At that point, which is actually your ever-present 
              condition, there is no exclusive identity with this particular organism,
               no constriction of consciousness to the head, a constriction that makes
               it seem that “you” are in the head looking at the rest of the world out
               there; there is no binding of attention to the personal bodymind: 
              instead, consciousness is one with all that is arising – a vast, open, 
              transparent, radiant, infinitely Free and infinitely Full expanse that 
              embraces the entire Kosmos, so that every single subject and every 
              single object are erotically united in the Great Embrace of One Taste. 
              You disappear from merely being behind your eyes, and you become the 
              All, you directly and actually feel that your basic identity is 
              everything that is arising moment to moment (just as previously you felt
               that your identity was with this finite, partial, separate, mortal coil
               of flesh you call a body). Inside and outside have become One Taste. I 
              tell you, it can happen just like that!<br></span></p>

                                                      tends to feel the pyshological effect of one religion or teaching,
                                                      for eg, the teaching of buddhism avocate that life is an illusion,
                                                      at such, those who followed will lead a simple and contented life,
                                                      on the other hand, extremist religion or teaching give rise to
                                                      competition and a never satisfactory life, no matter rich and
                                                      comfortable they are...teaching also include education, the base of
                                                      one education can determine the thinking of an individual in due
                                                      course. Therefore, you have to look back on what set up to such
                                                      kind of thinking. You should know the best.</p>

              <p>As I explained to him in the other thread, in Buddhism life is not an illusion but 'like' an illusion in the sense that it's ever-changing, ungraspable, and yet ever-present, vivid and clear.</p>
              <p>Also we have to look within and just question, 'Who am I?', and not take our mental interpretations and ideas as answers (it is much more direct and simpler than this -- just pause all thoughts, your sense of Being is still undoubtedly present) and sense this undoubtable Presence, Spirit, Consciousness, Beingness. This essence of being cannot be doubted. If we realise this it will solve our existential doubts. It is to this ever-present, timeless, undoubtable Presence that statements like 'Before Abraham was, I AM' (not I Was, but I AM), or 'I AM THAT I AM' are made. We also understand statements like '"The eye through which I see God is the same eye through which God sees 
                              me; my eye and God's eye are one eye, one seeing, one knowing, one 
                              love."
                                Yet even this realisation is just the beginning... but being grounded in this Knowing/Being is enough to resolve many confused thinking and doubts about identity and existence.</p>

              <p>As a kid, I often wondered why people and monks would claim 'life is an illusion'. It was only till I matured then I realized what that claim truly meant.</p>
              <p>Being human beings, we often have dreams and aspirations, which are of the future, something that we are seeking and looking towards for. As all these had not happen yet while we are still living in the present, thus 'life is an illusion' - being the future, in truth, is only an illusion, YET to be realized, IF possible.</p>
              <p>Those who are optimistic and hardworking will tend to believe it is a reality that can be acheived. It becomes their goals, an unshakable belief in themselves and their capabilities.</p>
              <p>Those who are pessimistic and cynical, looking at others who succeeded, while they have not even made that attempt to do so, or did and couldnt make it, and DON'T realize why, will utter 'life is an illusion', a future that cannot happen, and walk away crestfallen.</p>
              <p>--------------</p>
              <p>Similarly, 'life is an illusion' can be used to describe the past.</p>
              <p>No human can be right or perfect in all he/she does. There are bound to be mistakes along the way, some minor, but some major ones which cause regrets. It is those regrets that makes one believed all that had been said and done in the past had not be real, for dreams had not been realized/turned into the perfect reality or the way it should be or believed to be. Thus, 'life is an illusion' or 'life had been an illusion'.</p>
              <p>The keyword is BELIEF - a self conceptualisation or perception from the mind based on one's PRESENT living enviroment about the PAST and the FUTURE.</p>
              <p>And the sad thing about beliefs are that they can be doubted. Beliefs are not as sure as the sun that rises from the east and sets in the west,  or a glass of water before us - a physical reality we can see, touch, smell, taste, hear.</p>
              <p>The 5 senses make up what we call consciousness. Dreams are illusions that we can never touch, or see clearly, or smell keenly, or hear about, let alone taste it!</p>
              <p>So Are we living in an illusion, at this present moment?</p>
              <p>Look in the mirror and slap your right cheek hard.The answer lies in your response. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"> </p>
              <p>Just sharing a thought. Cheers!</p>

              <p>Thanks for the compliments, and I would say the same of yours though it is a bit more esoteric.</p>
              <p>Nope. I am not a Buddhist. Just someone as curious as you are and found out that learning never ends.</p>

              <p>I see... there's a book that just came to mind which I think you and everyone else should try to read... called 'The Power of Now' by Eckhart Tolle. E.T. is the author of two bestsellers books, both of which were NY Times bestsellers and heavily promoted by Oprah (Oprah also did a multiple episode webclass with Eckhart Tolle). It talks about similar things I mentioned but in a very transformative, inspiring and practical way.</p>
              <p>It can totally change the way you live and truly reduce and eliminate suffering and result in spiritual realisations. The author is not Buddhist but undergone a spiritual awakening at the age of 29. This book sort of propelled me spiritually as well when I bought it in 2006. Just recently I had <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/381623?page=2#post_9509175">certain experience</a> that made me understand better the experience that Eckhart Tolle undergone.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>So The Matrix actually misinterpreted the actual meaning of 'life is an illusion'? Oh yeah they are hollywood people anyway.. they can't even respect God, let alone correctly interprete phrases. Hollywood is such a disappointment. -_-   I wonder what movies they will have next year. LOL</p></div>
