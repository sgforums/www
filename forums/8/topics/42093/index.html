            <div class='col-md body'>In any case the word Buddha means The Awakened one. He did not bestow the title on himself. Before Buddhism, the Indians were mainy hindus. but Nirvana has been mentioned also in Vedic texts and scriptures. The Buddha went on his quest because he felt that worldly desires ends up to become nothingness in death. So what if you are rich and powerful, like all sentiment beings, you are fated to grow old fall sick and die..only to be born again. when the Buddha realised that, He seek to find away to be released from these suffering, which is to attain Nirvana.</div>

He nearly drowned while taking a bath in the river.  Extreme asectism called for practices like starving, standing on one leg for long periods of time, that sort of stuff.<br><br>He cut off some flesh to save a pigeon from a hawk in one of his past lives.  That lesso was two-fold.  One, it was to teach people that it took many lifetimes to attain enlightenment.  With each life time, you perfected one certain virtue.  Two, it was about compassion, one of the virtues in Buddhism.<br><br>He wanted to teach because he wanted laymen to share his knowledge.  Now it depends on which teaching a layman would like to follow.  I follow the Latter Day of the Law, which is the Lotus Sutra, the one that he expounded before he passed away.  He was the most significant one because he brought the techings of Buddhism to the laymen level, to a level thatanyone could understand.  There were other teachers and gurus, but when he approached them before he attianed enlightenment, he felt their teachings could not be understood easily by a layman.<br><br>His earlier teachings actually taught people how to attain enlightenment.  However, it may take several lifetimes.  However, according to the Lotus Sutra, he he actually taught believers how to achieve it in just one lifetime.  Thus, there was a split into several sects.<br><br>Does that answer your query?<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>

He did not bestow the title on himself. Before Buddhism, the Indians were mainy hindus. but Nirvana has been mentioned also in Vedic texts and scriptures. The Buddha went on his quest because he felt that worldly desires ends up to become nothingness in death. So what if you are rich and powerful, like all sentiment beings, you are fated to grow old fall sick and die..only to be born again. when the Buddha realised that, He seek to find away to be released from these suffering, which is to attain Nirvana.</div></blockquote>so Hidus come before Buddism? .....

            <div class='col-md body'>Think about it..if a religion does not have worshippers, will it still exist? Take the Aztecs and the Incans, are there still anyone practicing thier religion. Then again does that mean thier gods never existed in the first place.<br><br>Buddhist teachings are meant to be a teaching but people turn it into a religion. I myself refer it as a school of thought.
