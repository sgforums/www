            <div class='col-md body'>First, the indian who wrote his letter has bad grammar.<br><br>Second, his story does not click together, he said there were 3 stones he had worshipped. But upon cleaning them, he found diamonds of about 4600 carats each? Now he used the word 'each' hence each diamond is 4600 carats(not possible as the largest diamond is only a few hundred carats)<br><br>"Name: The Great Star of Africa ( Cullinan II ).<br>Size (rough): 530.20 carats.<br>The largest stone cut from the Cullinan/<br>Origin: South Africa<br>Today's Owner: British Crown Jewels."<br><a href="http://www.21cep.com/gift/d2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.21cep.com/gift/d2.htm</a><br><br>Third, even if it is 4600 carats, they have not been certified if they are genuine or if the quality of the diamond is any good, the 3Cs, which stand for Clarity, Cut and Color.
