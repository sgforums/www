            <div class='col-md body'>Reasons why men should worship women.  All this information is backed up by scientific proof.<br>1. Without women you will not be here today.<br>2. Worship women, anyone who is a woman. Cos every woman is like your mum, don't rape a woman, unless u'r willing<br>to rape ur own mum.<br>3. Women are superior to men, bcos u need more than 40 million sperms to fertilize an ovum/egg.  Guys, thats quantity, not quality!!!!!!!!<br>4.Sperms are 75 000 times smaller than ovums.<br>5. Females have two x chromosomes, which carry genes.  Males have only one x chromosome, and this x chromosomes come from ur mother only.<br>6. X chromosomes bears over 2 500 genes, Y carries only 15.  U have 2 485 genes less than a female.<br>7.  A male is a biological accident.  Y(male) gene is an incomplete<br>X(female) gene.<br>8. In other words, the male is an incomplete female, thus a walking<br>abortion.<br>9.  From health statistics, in the past 50 years, average volume of<br>ejaculate declined by 20%, and sperm quality is dropping.<br>10.  There is a greater % of deformed and sluggish sperms. (Hahahaha)<br>11. Women are multi talented.  They r now full time career women, and yet they can still run a household.  Guys on the other hand come home from work, and complain.<br>12.  Women have a higher threshold of pain, thats why GOD gave us the power to give birth and bring life into this world.<br>13. Women have a longer life expectancy.<br>14. Young men run a much greater risk than young women from dying of accidents and violence.<br>15. MEN are dumb, u r so interested in the females breasts, IT'S ONLY a LUMP of FAT.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>16.  Females are highly specialised beings, we have two openings for pleasure and urine excerition.  U guys only have ONE urethra where both sperm and urine passes.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br>17.  And for ur extra info, urine is acidic, which makes it an<br>unsuitable condition for sperm.<br>18. In the brain, testosterone is converted to estrogen, to bring about its stimulatory effects.  SO listen up guys,  the male hormone has to be changed into the female hormone to bring about masculinizing effects.  Ur not so macho witho ut female hormones.<br>19.  Ur mitochondria ( energy source) comes from ur mother not ur<br>father.  UR more female than u think!!!!<br>20. Males only have testosterone and a little quantity of estrogen as sex hormones.  Females have more, we have estrogen, progesterone and testosterone.  Mind u we have more testosterone than u have of our estrogen.<br>21.  There is a higher level of fatility in male foetuses.<br>22. The Y chromosomes of males is smaller than the X chromosome which is a female.<br>23.  Every male is part of a female, as u carry our X chromosomes.<br>Thus, Every male is 50% female.<br>24. Although females are the ones who give birth and concieve, more males are likely to have a break down during pregnancy of their spouses.  U GUYS R WEAK, we go through the pain, and u cry more than we do.<br>25. Before u r born a male, u r a female first for the first 12 weeks in<br>ur mothers womb.<br>26.  Behind every successful man, there is a woman.  BUT behind every successful woman, is herself.<br>27.  The males have bigger brains than women.  But WOMEN use a higher % of their brains than men.<br>28.  Women have lower risks of high cholesterol levels, than males, all thanks to our monthly periods.  So women be thankful that we menstruate.<br>29. Many males out there keep asking for virgin brides.  Honestly if u want a virgin bride, than be a virgin urself.  Don't carry STD's and give it to ur virgin bride. She doesn't deserve it.<br>30.  There are more good looking females out there than males.  You can't count the number of extremely pretty women, its countless ( Cindy Crawford, Aishwarya Rai, Elle Macpherson, Julia Roberts, Jeniffer<br>Lopez........). how many males can u list???<br>Only two in my list ( my dad &amp; Brad Pitt).<br>31.  U find pleasure in superficial stuff  ( Pamela Anderson is plastic<br>and make up)<br><br>So females: Stand up tall and be PROUD to be A WOMAN.  We are superiors<br>to males in many ways.  Do not let males put you through shit, put u down,<br>or use you. You are better off without a male who makes u suffer. There are<br>more things to life than a worthless/useless guy.   You are capable of<br>achieving more than you think.  You are Stronger than u think u r.  Respect<br>and honour urself, bcos u are worth more than that.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><span style="color: brown;">hehee just for entertainment purposes... lol</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm puzzled, why do women always think they are the sole reason there is a human race when it's immediately apparent that the existence of the human race is obviously meant to be a two party affair. The role of each other cannot be played down in any way as both are equally vital.<br><br>If women need men as much as fish need bicycles (said by a feminist who later got married  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ), then there really wouldn't be much women around would they?<br><br>The concept of reproduction does not begin and end with conception and birth, it entails seeing that the offspring reach their own reproduction maturity as well. Almost all women can give birth, but can all be good parents? Given the high rate of children murdered in the womb by their consenting mothers, and many who have been raised dysfunctional, I sometimes wonder why some like to hog the dubious honour of child raising all for women herself, when it is apparent that the human race currently is doing a sod poor job at it.<br><br>Child birth may be amazing, but then again, the onus of raising the child to the point of their own maturity is far, far more important. You are a baby for at most 3 years, and grow up for the next 17. In these contributions that men make to the nuclear family is more then enough to be considered revelant and no less to that of the women's role.<br><br>In the days before there was civilisation, men had to protect and provide for their families, risking a violent end everytime they went out to hunt prey. Their very bodies served to be the buffer from the harsh environment that allowed their wives to raise their children. Civilisation was not built by the efforts of women itself, it was a hard fought and bitter struggle by both genders trying to survive in the wilderness, and back then gender roles were hardly an issue.<br><br>It's easy to go girl power now when modern living means that food, water, warmth and shelter are within reach. The truth is, in crunch time, both genders are going to need each other, and they have their role to play.<br><br>NS not compariable to childbirth? Please, the grass is always greener on the other side. Women can complain about their biological problems (amazing that supposed superiority comes with so many serious and disabling flaws), but then would they like to be free of these problems? And face the kind of rough-and-tumble lifestyle men face? A lifestyle where you are expected to deal with your own problems, where a friend on the phone for 5 hours is not to be expected, and where people don't usually care if you turned up at the party or not?<br><br>I think the issue of girls going for NS is irrevelant, though I think it's a good thing as it helps a person discover their own mental and physical potential as well as teaching you to be indepedent and mature. But then again, as I said, it's irrevelant. Both genders have their place and role and should jolly well know them. Saying or insulting the other's place in the human race is like cutting your rope when you are hanging off a cliff.<br><br>If feminists can't see a need for men, I wonder if they are alien to the concept of a father. Also, MCPs who think women are inferior... do they respect their mother? Extreme gender superiority complex is ultimately self-insulting. Girl power? There would be no girl power if there was no men, vice versa...<br><br>Seriously, girl power is ignorant cliche. The reality is, no one gender is really greater then the other in any way, and both need each other. In fact, the human race is defined by it's two genders. Take away one and you have extinction. It's a partnership, not a one-man/woman show.<br><br>Of course, I also wonder why girls are buying into such a male concept of ignorant superiority that they accuse MCPs of as well...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let the debunking begin!<br><br>Note that I am only picking out the illogical ones, these are not intended to be childish insults but reasoned, rational analysis of the supposed "superiority". I have left some out as they are obviously written in bad taste and general ignorance of subject matter.<br><br>Let's start.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by bjork:<br><strong>Reasons why men should worship women.  All this information is backed up by scientific proof.</strong></blockquote><br><br>Though I know she isn't that serious, it's good to note that not all this information is exactly scientific... and most of it highly emotional (femal trait) and opiniated, contray to the idea of science as an impartial, neutral tool to observe and discover the truth. Hitler himself used plenty of "scientific" proofs to show that aryans are the master race and the subhuman jews should be exterminated.<br><br><strong>1. Without women you will not be here today.</strong><br><br>Obviously, reproduction requires two parties, it's good to note that every single woman would not be herre today without her father.<br><br><strong>3. Women are superior to men, bcos u need more than 40 million sperms to fertilize an ovum/egg.  Guys, thats quantity, not quality!!!!!!!!</strong><br><br>The female reproductive system is highly hostile to any foreign invader, even that from her partner, this is to avoid her from going into toxic shock from the thousand or so types of harmful microorganisms ready to cause infection in the womb and surrounding structures. If the male were to produce just one reproductive vector, chances of survival, no matter how tough, are very, very slim. Also, the chances of this reproductive vector finding the ovum within the female reproductive system makes this even more unlikely.<br><br>So 40 (actually 50) million is not a sign of weakness, but a sign that the job is so difficult to acomplish that it needs a proper graspe on the numbers to be acompished. Any what are you complaining? Was this not the system that made you?<br><br><strong>4.Sperms are 75 000 times smaller than ovums.</strong><br><br>Woman, you are illogical.<br><br>There is no logical link between size and supposed "superiority" all the sperm needs to do is to propel the genetic material towards the ovum, the ovum needs to carry the food for the embryo and the stuff necessary to provide the building blocks for life. If the sperm was the size of an ovum, it would be a terribly wasteful affair to produce and for what? Acomplishing the job that something 75,000 times smaller can? Where's the praticality in that? Efficency of design matters in nature, not concepts like size that are irrevelant, they are a means to efficency, not an end.<br><br><strong>5. Females have two x chromosomes, which carry genes.  Males have only one x chromosome, and this x chromosomes come from ur mother only.  </strong><br><br>50 percent of the genetic material that makes you special and who you are comes from your father, you don't see us guys making a big hoo haa about that.<br><br><strong>6. X chromosomes bears over 2 500 genes, Y carries only 15.  U have 2 485 genes less than a female.</strong><br><br>Got news, we have millions of genes and most of our genes are dormant and not used anyway, what's 2 485 genes? As significant to the fact that you must have lost 10,000 brain cells wasted thinking up such a lame point.<br><br><strong>7.  A male is a biological accident.  Y(male) gene is an incomplete<br>X(female) gene.</strong><br><br>Oooh... getting personal that is? So you are the product of a biological accident as well?<br><br><strong>8. In other words, the male is an incomplete female, thus a walking<br>abortion.</strong><br><br>If you believe that, that means that the lack of 2 485 genes in a genome of millions makes people a walking abortion? Is that why feminists advocate abortion as a women's right when 50 percent of the babies killed are girls? I suppose if such reasoning of genes is to be followed, it can be reasoned that Hitler was justified in claiming that the rest of the races (including you) are degenerate because of the lack of white blood and hence have no right to live?<br><br>The lack of genes is a nice theory that appeals to victimized women, but serious people should see it for the sham it really is.<br><br><strong>9.  From health statistics, in the past 50 years, average volume of<br>ejaculate declined by 20%, and sperm quality is dropping.</strong><br><br>That's only half the story, female fertility problems have been on the rise too.<br><br><strong>10.  There is a greater % of deformed and sluggish sperms. (Hahahaha)</strong><br><br>Not only have female fertility problems have been on the rise, these problems are in general more serious in implication as the woman only released one egg a month and anything messing with that will effectively sterilize her. The man on the other hand, still can acomplish the job, thanks to quantity. Guess the numbers weren't so bad after all.<br><br>And isn't this a problem that would affect everybody in the end? You can't reproduce there will be no combatants left to carry out this needless gender debate, but that probably hasn't occured to you.<br><br><strong>11. Women are multi talented.  They r now full time career women, and yet they can still run a household.  Guys on the other hand come home from work, and complain.</strong><br><br>The most amazing point. Women do not complain???? And by the way, how many full time carrer women actually <span style="font-style: italic;">run</span> a household? You only have 24 hours a day lady, spending 9 hours of them away from a home is hardly considered running it.<br><br><strong>12.  Women have a higher threshold of pain, thats why GOD gave us the power to give birth and bring life into this world.</strong><br><br>But God didn't give you the power to create it. And since you are into the concept of God, it's good to know that pain during childbirth was actually a curse on women in the bible after the fall.<br><br>And since they have a higher threshold of pain, why are they so squeamish about NS? Go in and show the guys who is boss lah!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>13. Women have a longer life expectancy</strong><br><br>Which makes you wonder why they complain so much about their physical problems... if you life is so tragic and painful, why live so long?<br><br>The actual researched reason why men tend to life shorter lives is because they are exposed to stress more often, and served expendable and dangerous, dirty job roles in soceity while women could still serve in nurturing roles when they were old. Hence selective pressure was not in favour of a man living too long beyond his reproductive prime.<br><br>Get this, we live shorter lives because we have to bear the weight of your support on our backs.<br><br><strong>14. Young men run a much greater risk than young women from dying of accidents and violence.</strong><br><br>Figures, we are the ones who have to fight wars, hunt animals, protect you from harm, and smash that cockroach while you stand on the chair screaming.<br><br>Instead of being thankful, you see this as a sign on inferiority... hai... next time your BF dun help you kill ka zuah then you know....<br><br><strong>15. MEN are dumb, u r so interested in the females breasts, IT'S ONLY a LUMP of FAT.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </strong><br><br>Women can't be much smarter either if they believe in that sterotype.<br><br><strong>16.  Females are highly specialised beings, we have two openings for pleasure and urine excerition.  U guys only have ONE urethra where both sperm and urine passes.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> </strong><br><br>Efficency in design lady, anything that's inefficent and not absolutely necessary is weeded out. Want to blame, go blame MOTHER nature.<br><br>But I'm perfectly happy with such a system, faster toliet trips, no queues, and can answer nature's call standing up. I wonder if it's really as bad as you crank it out to be?<br><br><strong>17.  And for ur extra info, urine is acidic, which makes it an<br>unsuitable condition for sperm.</strong><br><br>And somehow your father still came up with you? Ain't we amazing? Apparently the male design is far more superior then you envisioned.<br><br><strong>18. In the brain, testosterone is converted to estrogen, to bring about its stimulatory effects.  SO listen up guys,  the male hormone has to be changed into the female hormone to bring about masculinizing effects.  Ur not so macho witho ut female hormones.</strong><br><br>Huh? What male female hormones? That is unfortunately a piece of feminist propangada lady. Hormones are just chemicals that serve purposes, they have little gender bearing by themselves, where every they may be produced.<br><br>BTW, do you not admit that even you need testosterone to be considered a woman? The idea is not in what is present, but in what balance... tsk. Both hormones are found in both genders, if you can raise a hoo ha about this, apparently you are generally ignorant about subject matter.<br><br><strong>19.  Ur mitochondria ( energy source) comes from ur mother not ur<br>father.  UR more female than u think!!!!</strong><br><br>To be human is not to be more female or male, it is to be who you are created by a fusion of your mother and father. There is no such thing as being more male or female, barring mental disorders, being "more female then u think!!!" is an irrevelant concept. The fact remains that the normal, non gender ambigous males are males!<br><br><strong>20. Males only have testosterone and a little quantity of estrogen as sex hormones.  Females have more, we have estrogen, progesterone and testosterone.  Mind u we have more testosterone than u have of our estrogen.</strong><br><br>Is it any surprise why your posts are less rational and bodering on the innane and insane? Or that you get upset over little things? Unable to see rationally? Or make posts where things that are not even an advantage appear to be advantages to you?<br><br><strong>21.  There is a higher level of fatility in male foetuses.</strong><br><br>Being a male is a risky calling that only the fittest and brave answer to you know, after all, who wants to live a life as provider, protector in a soceity that affords him little protection for his efforts to sometimes the ungrateful female? Be glad for the guys around you lady. It is hard to find gems but pebbles are a dime a dozen.<br><br><strong>22. The Y chromosomes of males is smaller than the X chromosome which is a female.</strong><br><br>See the above rebuttals... haven't we been through this before?<br><br><strong>23.  Every male is part of a female, as u carry our X chromosomes.<br>Thus, Every male is 50% female.</strong><br><br>By the same biology you are also 50 percent male... figures? Or are you ignorant enough to find this even above the inane?<br><br><strong>24. Although females are the ones who give birth and concieve, more males are likely to have a break down during pregnancy of their spouses.  U GUYS R WEAK, we go through the pain, and u cry more than we do.</strong><br><br>I believe that's a large part attributed to the stress the pregnant spouse gives to the hapless male who has to meet her every need, irrational or not. After all pregnant women are a bombshell of hormonal reactions that they take out on their hapless spouse.<br><br>They go through the physical torture of birth, but the guys go through the mental torture of it. Which is worse? Go figure.<br><br><strong>25. Before u r born a male, u r a female first for the first 12 weeks in<br>ur mothers womb.</strong><br><br>Also you were akin to a baterial for the first 12 hours, but I don't see you harping on that. And before that, you were... gasp! A sperm in your father's body!<br><br><strong>26.  Behind every successful man, there is a woman.  BUT behind every successful woman, is herself.</strong><br><br>Surprising, she must have no father or supportive husband? And if they are so good why do we always hear them complain so much every time something little messes up? I mean please...<br><br><strong>27.  The males have bigger brains than women.  But WOMEN use a higher % of their brains than men.</strong><br><br>Ho ho ho, that's where you are wrong... women's brains are better connected between the two hemispheres as they have had a lot of pratice with foraging, gathering and socializing in the traditional context. Hence, they have better wired brians showing more activity. But that hardly denotes intelligence.<br><br>The male brain howver, was wired for hunting and hence the larger size was devoted to the senses and a better spatial (3d) ability for situtational awareness. This made sucessful hunting possible. Hence while he does not have to social abilities of the woman (hence his cruder nature), the female is virtually deaf, dumb and blind when it comes to making sense of the world next to him.<br><br>Due to their reduced spatial ability, compared to men, women also have more trouble finding directions and having situtational awareness, that's why girls seem more blur in a fluid, non verbal situtation at times and also why there are much less female fighter pilots and other jobs that require the male brain.<br><br><strong>28.  Women have lower risks of high cholesterol levels, than males, all thanks to our monthly periods.  So women be thankful that we menstruate.</strong><br><br>The complex reproductive system of females unfortunately, makes them more prone to many different reproductive diseases, disorders and cancer. So it's a kinda tradeoff, you can cut high cholesterol but cancer?<br><br><strong>29. Many males out there keep asking for virgin brides.  Honestly if u want a virgin bride, than be a virgin urself.  Don't carry STD's and give it to ur virgin bride. She doesn't deserve it.</strong><br><br>What does this have to do with superiority?<br><br></div>
