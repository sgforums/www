And i remember carrying those Sonia Rykiel bags was also part of the wardrobe...<br><br>Any one care to any ? pretty nostalgic to bring back to those days, iwas like still in secondary school.</div>

Just replenish so still quite new.<br><br>Ralph Lauren has got good cutting but seeing ah bengs and coffeeshop uncles/aunties wearing them, I kind of regretted buying so many pieces. Now I am being grouped along with the cheap, old generation that goes for FAKE Polo Ralph Lauren clothes sold at Pasa Malam. Makes me wanna puke.<br><br>Now I only make sure any Ralph Lauren clothings I wear would have the logo printed in color as opposed to those counterfeit ones.<br><br>But I am verging towards Armani and Etienne Aigner stuff.
