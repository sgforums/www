            <div class='col-md body'>this is kinda long...<br><br>i got to know my gf when we were in sec sch, that was around 15-16yrs ago...back then, she was one of the more popular girls, and often, my friends and i would refer her as "the girl with then indian bf", for obvious reason...while to her, i was probably "just another guy"...we never talked to each other, and the only thing we had in common was we lived around the same area and took the same bus...and then came graduation...and i've never seen her from then on...until...<br><br>it was around 1996 or 97...it was my friend's birthday, and he asked me and a few of our buddies down to ridley's, our then favourite spot...my fren brought along his new gf, who happened to be an ex school mate, and she asked her cousin along, who turned out to be none other than "the girl with the indian bf"! wow! she's looking hotter than before! gone were her specs, and she looked real sexy when she danced...but even then, we didn't even greeted each other, i was enjoying myself in the crowd dancing, and she was dancing by herself...then, the time came for us to leave, and that was the last i've seen of her...until...<br><br>the year was 1999...my close friends set up a shop, and i was asked to quit my then current job to work with them...and so, there i was, sitting there in the shop, when she came in...yes, it's "the girl with the indian bf"...this time around, she approached me, and we talked like we've known each other for a long time(well, we did know each other for a long itme but...you know what i mean)...she'd drop by once in awhile after her work, and we'd talk a smoke break outside the buildings...and we enjoyed taking jibes at each other...but not long after that, she stopped coming down to my workplace, and again, i've never got to see her again...until...<br><br>2002, my company's annual dinner...she was invited by my friends to attend, and she sat next to me during dinner...as usual, we took jibes at each other, talked and enjoyed ourselves...she told me she was quitting her job and would be joining my company come august, i was delighted! and sure enough, august came, and we became colleagues...things were as per normal in the first few weeks, until i got a call one nite...it was her...she called me up to chat, and we chatted for 4 straight hours! slowly, i knew i was falling for her...we went out for dinner more and more often, and one nite, after dinner at Raffles marina, she asked if i was interested to go on a short trip with her during the CNY, i said "sure! why not?!" and on the second day of CNY, we left singapore for KL, it was a 4 days 3 nites trip...all the while when we were there, i was tempted to express my feelings for her, but somehow, words fail me...until the last day, on our way back to singapore on the coach...we were talking about our mutual friends when she suddenly told me that she had feelings for me! i told her i felt likewise, but we both agreed that it's just not the right time and place...but at least, we both confirmed our feelings for each other...a few days later, we left singapore again, this time, with our friends to Bali...and after all the shopping and dinner, as we slowly made our way back to the hotel, she looked up into the sky and said "wow! look at all those stars!" and, not knowing where i got the courage, i held her hand and she didn't let go! and that is how we started... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
