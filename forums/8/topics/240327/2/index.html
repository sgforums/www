"Lady boss" is still a widely used - albeit mildly derogatory - joke, women in high positions still have to put up with behind-the-back speculation that she "slept her way there", powerful women still have trouble finding life partners who won't be threatened by their status/wealth ...ironically, both men AND women are guilty of keeping this status quo... just because there are more women in control of their lives out there doesn't mean social attitudes have changed much.<br><br>Just like someone said earlier in this thread, a woman still has to work doubly hard to prove her worth.  It's still hard for a woman to rise to the top on her own and earn respect.  It requires an unusual level of control over one's emotions (cool-headedness) and alot of skill.  Then there's the social expectations of you as a woman - you have to do more than a man, you're expected to be a mom, too!<br><br>It's no wonder more and more girls are shunning the path of a career woman (aka supermom). It's just so much easier to sink into the chauvanistic stereotype of the pampered princess, no?  </strong></span></div>
