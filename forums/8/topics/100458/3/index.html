How can one know god, if evil = satan doesnt exists?<br><br>satanism is about denial of god, not belief in god existence. For satanism to exist, god must exists, and for satanists to deny. A bit deep here actually.<br><br>I actually view satanists not as people who dont believe god exists, but as people who are against god words and the bibles and so on. They have to recognise these, but they are against him and his words.<br><br>For enmity to arise ,there must be two parties, and they are the enemies of each other.<br><br>I think, you as a christian should be glad evil exists, so that man understand and appreciate god words, and know the right path to perfection.<br><br></div></blockquote>yeah, dats wad i thought, shouldn't they believe in God (or at least noe and went through the process of Christianity) first before denying God and fall to Satanism.<br><br>unlesss they are juz faithless wackos who juz join for the kick outta it.. den i nothing to say. cuz if i joined, i would be in this category. hehe.<br><br>lol.. 200 bucks? i dun remember dat part.. oh well, dat was years ago. haha..</div>

Go check with any overzealous preacher in  the forum, then with a real Satanist for more balanced view.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I believe, you have to separate 'believe in god', from 'knowing god exists'.<br><br>Logically, for a human, u may gain a knowledge, but doesnt mean you will agree at once. But who says you cant deny or disagree. Thats the whole idea. Doesnt have to go thru process of believing.<br><br>Dont just brush them aside as 'faithless wacko'. Its about perspective, unless you wish to admit you are biased against them because they peform blasphemous acts against god. Btw, nothing wrong to say one is biased against them because they are on the opposite camp. Biased aint a negative word.<br><br>Also, when labelling them as faithless wacko, dont forget, even in Christianity, many do not fully understand Christianity and join due to peer influence, foolish adoption of western thinkings and culture, thinking its hip and cool and so on..i find this true especially for many Singaporean teenagers who are no longer streetwise as b4...<br><br>Always two side to a coin.<br><br></div>
