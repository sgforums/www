It's the people who started the war, not the religion.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>1) u may not feel it, but to throw someone out of your home can be a very cruel thing to do. Do you think about what mental abuse u may have inflicted on the person? Or do you think that verbal and mental abuse is not considered cruel? YOU would ba a damn scary bugger to live with if u think being cruel is to impale ppl with spikes, because obviously you do not think that chasing ppl out of your house is in anyway cruel.<br><br>2) Destroy here is just a euphemism for certain actions. Do you literaly consider the words only or do u look deeper? So you do not think that calling the police and getting, maybe a pervert who was harresing you, to be destroying him? What does destroying someone mean to you? Do you have to literally smite the person down with thunder? I personally would prefer to think that destroying someone's future is a form of destruction as well. Even punching them in the face and breaking some teeth is a form of destruction, destruction of their ability to look good or to speak properly or to eat properly. Once again, if you do not consider the acts I've quoted as examples as being destructive to a person, you're a scary bugger to meet in the streets.<br><br>3) Yes you can say that people start wars. But if you are of a religion that says thou shalt not kill, and you are a soldier, what then? Risk sinning? Like I pointed out, the onus here is on how useful and logical these rules are to life. Its no point being of a certain recognised religion and then still kill children and adults. That would be plain hypocrisy. Apparently if ppl stuck to the rule not to harm children at all, instead of having a rule that says "do not kill" and then think, "oh since i have to kill adults anyways, im breaking the rule so children do not matter", perhaps the world would be a better place. Children would not be getting slaughtered in the Gaza strip.</div>

The point here is, just like the rules for any other religion, following the rules require you to think with some common sense. Its no use for you to show that the rules are crappy and flawed by following EVERYTHING literally and without any trace of common sense. If your mind is so narrow and fixed that the word "destroy" and "cruel" have only very fixed definations for you, then what more can I say? Every religion's rules do require some common sense to interpret. If not, you would be just another religious extremist. So whats the point of thinking like an EXTREMIST just to point out that the rules are flawed? U could think like an extremist for ANY religion and they would all seem flawed.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br></div>

Do not harm little children.<br><br>10. Do not kill non-human animals unless you are attacked or for your food.<br><br>these 2 rules tell you to have love, or at the least, respect for small children and animals. If you can't even start with the basics, forget about loving your fellow men.<br><br>I have shown that it is not true that the rules encourage you to be egoistic. Perhaps they are rather self centered, but most humans tend to think for themselves 1st. I guess, it depends on your interpretation of the rules to become more egoistic or less. Perhaps then, you are not suitable to follow these rules since u have demonstrated that you would look towards the negative aspects and become more egoistic? I repeat again that it is all in the interpretation. If I can thus so interpret it to teach people to be less egoistic, why can't you? Perhaps the fundamental problem lies within you?<br><br>Do you see now why I think you are a scary bugger? YOU cannot see the same good natured teachings and rules. Therein lies the crux of the matter. If one has a pure mind, then one would be able to interpret the rules in a positive manner. The problem here is that YOU cannot see, keyword being "YOU"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Would you dare say there is a definitly interpretation to the rules? Lots of stuff have been twisted and turned in favor of oneself. You can twist it that way, I can twist it this way.<br><br>If you want to show the rules are evil... Simple! Just show '11. When walking in open territory, bother no one. If someone bothers you, ask him to stop. If he does not stop, destroy him.' Then we focus on the word 'DESTROY.' From there we will just say 'All satanist are evil because they are out to destroy!'<br><br>Mental destruction is much worst then physical destruction... So what is more evil?

I've already pointed out that <strong>YOU</strong> are the one who choose to dwell on the most negative aspect possible for the words, and that <strong>YOU</strong> are the one who choose the most extremist views possible for each rule to argue with. I've even gone as far as to point out that <strong>YOU</strong> view the rules as preaching for one to be egoistical when <strong>I</strong> can view so otherwise. Therein, lies my reasons for thinking <strong>YOU</strong> are a scary bugger. If <strong>YOU</strong> still cannot see, or choose not to see on purpose, then further discussion with <strong>YOU</strong> is meaningless.<br><br>As for he usage of certain words like cruelty, merciless and destruction, no doubt they are harsh words. But they have manifested themselves in many other religions, even though they aren't written in their rules or commandments. Christian crusades? Muslim jihads? Need I say more? Or do I have to point out that Satanists haven't actually waged a holy war against anyone before? So big deal if those words are there, like I said, its up to each individual's own common sense to interpret them.<br><br>Finally, I have to say, I am not twisting words and using them to the broadest sense just for the sake of arguing. For example, if the rule calls for me to be destroy the perv who does not stop bothering me, I would certainly call the cops and maybe even give them a knock or 2 on the head, but common sense would tell me that murdering them is out of the question. I must ask now, WHY do <strong>YOU</strong> <span style="font-style: italic;">insist</span> on the <strong>MOST</strong> literal and extreme meanings possible for interpretation of the rule? Is there no leeway for a broader and kinder interpretation? And why do <strong>YOU</strong> think so when I think that there IS leeway for a broader and kinder interpretation? So you see, the reason WHY <strong>I</strong> think <strong>YOU</strong> are a scary bugger is because:<br><br>1stly, I see the rules in a way which allow for kinder interpretation while <strong>YOU</strong> do not<br><br>2ndly, I do not see the need to take words like "cruel" and "destroy" in their most literal translation and interpretation while <strong>YOU</strong> do.<br><br>from these 2 points I would like to point out that YOU seem to be a very extreme person who seem to purposely go for the most extreme views.</div>
