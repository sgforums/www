As far as I can see from this report, Alexandra doesn't really mind charging high prices. Only after it was "exposed" by the comparison that it decided to slash it's cost.<br><br>So what does this say about the things that happened in the past. Obviously, Alexandra was making profit by jacking the cost high. The best way of making profit is to lower the cost so as to earn on the difference.<br><br>Well, indeed. Alexandra is earning on the difference. In fact, it's pushing the cost high so that they can earn a big difference.<br><br>What more can I say?<br><br>OCT 1, 2003<br>Alexandra acts swiftly to cut fees<br><br>Hospital wastes no time after high charges are revealed<br><br>By Salma Khalik<br>HEALTH CORRESPONDENT<br><br>TALK about instant action. On Monday, Alexandra Hospital did not look too good when the Health Ministry released a list of charges for 28 hospital treatments.<br><br>It was found charging subsidised patients the highest prices for the three most common treatments.<br><br>But within 24 hours, the hospital moved to slash prices for two procedures, and assured patients that it had already cut charges for the third.<br><br>Down goes the bill for gastrocopies: $175 yesterday, it will be $125 today.<br><br>Down goes the charge for colonoscopies: from $320 to $280.<br><br>And the charge for cataract surgery, which the ministry listed as costing $1,051 at Alexandra, was cut to $830 two weeks ago.<br><br>The prices made public on Monday are median prices for subsidised patients, which means that half of the patients paid less.<br><br>The hospital said it managed to cut the cost of cataract surgery after buying in bulk a lens needed for the surgery through a group purchasing scheme serving all public hospitals.<br><br>The spokesman said the price used to be high because Alexandra did not enjoy economies of scale. Over the last 12 months, it did just over 400 of the 11,600 cataract operations in the public sector.<br><br>These three procedures were highlighted by The Straits Times yesterday as they affect more than 30,000 patients a year.<br><br>Yesterday, the hospital brainstormed to see how they could bring down the cost of the other two.<br><br>The spokesman said comparison of bill sizes 'has forced us to look hard at our prices, ask tougher questions and examine closely our practices and our treatment'.<br><br>Patients who require gastroscopy to diagnose stomach problems and who may have ulcers, will no longer have a routine ulcer test as well. Instead, they will now be billed separately for it.<br><br>The current practice of giving more expensive non-standard, and therefore unsubsidised, drugs to many patients, will also end. Only those who really need the more expensive drugs will get them.<br><br>The Health Ministry released prices to help patients make more informed decisions.<br><br>Other hospitals shown to have unusually high bills were also quick to explain.<br><br>Singapore General Hospital said that its B2 rate of $475 to treat sleep apnoea was more than twice Tan Tock Seng Hospital's $208 because it also tests for more than 10 types of sleep-related disorders.<br><br>Changi General Hospital explained that it had the highest charges for C class patients for asthma because a third are given a new, expensive drug, but one which 'reduces readmission to hospital and emergency visits'.<br><br>The new drug costs $70, whereas the generic drug is $4.<br><br>However, the National University Hospital, which charges women in a B1 ward over $1,000 more than Singapore General Hospital for the normal delivery of a baby, and also has the most expensive piles surgery for B2 patients, could not give a specific reason for the differences.<br><br>Instead, it said that no two patients are the same and different hospitals have different cost structures. It said it would try to reduce costs by learning from others.<br><br>The bill comparisons show that NUH is generally more expensive for private in-patients, CGH for subsidised in-patients and Tan Tock Seng Hospital for day surgery.<br>Copyright @ 2003 Singapore Press Holdings.
