              <p>Singaoreans have become addicted to the internet. After reading about numerous individuals who lost their spouses or their jobs due to their addiction to the internet and their online personas.There are countless case studies of individuals who have lost their marriages, children, jobs and more due to their all-consuming desire to surf the web, interact with various social media outlets, view porn, participate in online games such as World of Warcraft, enter chat rooms, etc.  It dawned on me that if you were somehow able to create a persona and send it out into the real world—where it could go to work for you . then you would never have to go back to being yourself. .    Facebook, MSN chats, Myspace, i had enough of this sh*t acting as surrogates. Your surrogate can be any gender, ethnicity, or age. You feel what the surrogate feels. You see what the surrogates sees. troubling question kept nagging at me.  Are we becoming too comfortable communicating with each other virtually via our technology versus real face-to-face contact?</p>
              <p><br><br>If so, what future implications will this have on our relationships? I could not help thinking how seductive this premise was and how close humanity may be to a future of this kind.<br><br>Did you know that internet addiction is a very real problem affecting millions?</p>
              <p>Internet mediums are supposed to help people connect but it just does the opposite -people live in near-total isolation, rarely leaving the  comfort of their homes or believe if they did, they fall prey to scammers and sex predators. Put that aside, many people just dont go out to meet people because they are typing and chatting on the keyboard to others like them, taking away the incentive to meet people<br><br>In fact, internet addiction has become such a concern that the Center for Internet Addiction Recovery was established in 1995 to address this very issue.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They judge each others' characters through the text on their screens. Unfortunately, this isn't a "we" thing. This is one piece of crap that each of us has "designed." It's our own behavior and we can't blame anyone else or ask any one else to fix it. While our friends and family can help, ultimately each of us has to fight our own tendencies toward Internet addiction.</p>
              <p>It's great that we can email our friend on another continent, but not so great when we text a friend or loved one instead of seeing them in person. I'm hoping that the next generation doesn't lose the skills that are necessary for personal communication and that their addiction to gadgets and electronics will be more widely recognized as a serious problem</p>
