Advertising? How does it compete with the likes of Yahoo! or Altavista? You really gotta be talking about having a international brand name to really be earning anything. Even Yahoo! is not anywhere in the black anytime in the new future if I'm not mistaken or any of the Dot.coms. Horizon.com may deserve a second look, as it is one of the rare internet companys to actually make money. Currently trading below it's IPO price of $1.88.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Illegal Operation:</div><div class="quote_body">I will be putting money on Natsteel at the right time..<br><br></div></blockquote>good choice I would say, cos it could be in oversold zone rite now. But you might want to go easy on that one, cos we have absolutely no idea how the components shortage are going to impact the earnings of the electronics industry. You know STATS rite?<br><br>As for Creative, it's not really good value for your money, because of its hefty price. Even if it leaps $2, u only earn a paltry 100 bucks for ur $2,000 investment. If you got 10 lots 20c stock instead, u only need a $0.01 cent appreciation to earn the same amt. Also downside risk is limited. Think JIT and GES. Even professionals lost big time on that one. Lastly, you don't really want to expose yourself to the unfathomable mood swings on the NASDAQ. Leverage on penny stocks!<br><br>Caution: Make no mistakes about this, I'm by no standards anything more than a novice in the market. Just speaking from my experience I gained from my losses. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>[This message has been edited by Axl (edited 26 June 2000).]</div>

I'm comtemplating a stag. What's ur call?<br><br>Edgar Chia wrote:<br>|<br>| &gt;  SingaTrust, a semicon service company is launching<br>their IPO next<br>| &gt; Monday. The co provides a whole host of services<br>targeted at the<br>| &gt; semiconductor industry. Without going into too many<br>details, the<br>| &gt; simplest summary of their business would be:<br>| &gt;<br>| &gt;    * Engineering services. What it does is to help wafer<br>fabs (yes,<br>| &gt;      fabs like TSMC &amp; Chartered) integrate their<br>equipment &amp; work<br>| &gt;      processes. While not exactly a system integrator,<br>it is probably<br>| &gt;      the most simple comparison to make. Think of the<br>SingaTrust as<br>| &gt;      being a CSE, but servicing a different industry -<br>fabs.<br>| &gt;    * IC packaging. It will soon be providing wafer<br>bumping services, a<br>| &gt;      new IC packaging process. While touted to be a high<br>growth<br>| &gt;      business, wafer bumping only accounts for about 2%<br>of global<br>| &gt;      packaging techniques. As such, it is not going to<br>be significant<br>| &gt;      coming from such a low base.<br>| &gt;<br>| &gt;  Valuations are rich. Indicative pricing is about<br>S$1.00 - 1.20, or<br>| &gt; about 24-29x current year PE (for year ended June 2000).<br>System<br>| &gt; integrators like CSE are trading at about 20+ x PE,<br>while more<br>| &gt; established IC packaging houses trade at about the same<br>multiple too.<br>| &gt; It doesn't make sense that SingaTrust, a relatively<br>small co is<br>| &gt; offering its IPO at such lofty valuations. A gauge of<br>the co's size ~<br>| &gt; FY00 turnover = $81m, profit = 7m. No doubt the co has<br>high<br>| &gt; engineering capabilities (doing work for world-class<br>fabs like TSMC),<br>| &gt; it nevertheless appears to be a steady and stable<br>business. Growth<br>| &gt; estimates ~ 10%, making it even harder to justify such<br>| &gt; valuations. rgdsEdgar Chia</div>
