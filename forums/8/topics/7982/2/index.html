            <div class='col-md body'>I never watched SPIN b'cos of my past bad experiences with TCS production, but whar Jericho has described of SPIN generally applies to all TCS shows not just SPIN......<br><br>Growing Up: I don't know whats the hype about this show, with '70s people speaking perfect English. Not even a trace of realism in the show. Never watched a full episode, but can vaguely remember there's always this old man (Lim Kay Siu) shouting here and there and the Look-how-handsome-I'm-with-my-rebellious-face Andrew Seow staring at him. I feel like sticking a banana into his cocky face.<br><br>Phua Chu Kang: Still perplexed at why people love this low brow show. During one whole episode that I actually sat through, I actually winced at every joke they attempted, because the jokes are so stupid. E.g<br><br>(After an argument.....)<br><br>Somebody: Bygones....<br><br>PCK: Baygon(the insecticide)? Where got mosquito? Where? Where?<br><br>Me: Click(switch off TV)<br><br>Tonite with Gurmit: Another sick show with sick jokes. Gurmit banishes himself to the deepest of the Purgatory with his dumb antics and 'jokes'. I have to turn off the volume so that I can watch the stars without being<br><br>Channel News Asia: Donno whether you guys know this market reporter Jack Sung. I think he gets paid $15,000 every time he 'ermmmm's.<br>He stutters so much with his report that I can go to the toilet, fix a coffee and he's still with the same sentence. No wonder, the market falls whenever he's on morning duty. Thankfully, he has been transferred away.<br><br>Money: Watchable, suspect foreign talents from behind the scenes.<br><br>The Swordsman: Why must Fann be always present in every so call 'Big production'? And Ma Jing Tao really looks dumb with the shaggy dog hairdo.<br><br>In a nutshell, TCS peoduction(except 'Money') caters to people with shallow taste. You know who you are.</div>

My friend's friend claims to know the director of the former, and there's supposed to be something of interest to be announced.
