              <p>I was one of those who pre-ordered for jay chou's latest album with HMV. During that time (early May), we were given 2 options ONLY:</p>
              <p>1) metal box version with badges ($36)<br>2) normal paper version with badges ($24)</p>
              <p>I chose the metal box version and paid the money. On 18 May, I collected the album.</p>
              <p>Then just yesterday, I walk past HMV and saw from their display outside that they have the Taiwan metal box version with calendar ($39). The 3D calendar version is a better one than some lousy badges. I was shocked and enquired the staff why they didn't mention at that time of pre-order that they have the Taiwan version with calendar so that customers can make a more informed choice.</p>
              <p>Guess what they tell me?? ----&gt; "Taiwan version only come now."</p>
              <p>I was sooooooooooooooooooo p1ssed!!! They mean, they didn't know that taiwan version is coming or suddenly HMV boss feel like it, then he order taiwan version??</p>
              <p>Not even saying sorry for misinformation, they still have the cheeks to tell me that to get the calendar, I have to buy again the album. WTF do I do with 2 albums????? Totally brainless and lack of EQ!!!!</p>
              <p>Never going to pre-order anything again from HMV!!!!!!!!!!!!! TMD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

              <p>If it's 3 months later, then I can understand and not blame them. Now it seems like they're withholding information because of sale tactic! This is why I'm so angry, I feel cheated not given full information at time of pre-order!!!!!</p>

              <p>It doesn't matter if its 3 months, 3 days, or 3 hours. When you pre ordered the first set, it probably had 3 months lead time behind it. 2 weeks after that, the distributor came up with another package, HMV probably didn't have a choice but to take it. So you could say, your pre ordered set was the first batch, and the one with calender is the 2nd.</p>
              <p>The world doesn't work on an instance. When you pre order something, it most probably had months of planning behind it. Situations change in an instance, and hence sometimes you just have to suck it up.</p>
              <p>Look, I bought and alienware just this month that comes with the duo core, then just yesterday I learnt that they will be coming up with an updated version with an i3, i5, and i7 processor. But what can I do? Its just a waiting game that tests your patience.</p>

              <p>If they told you a new package was coming out 3 days after you collect your pre order, then you would hold off and so would everyone. Then there would be lesser sales. Low sales mean low demand, and low supply. Then the taiwan one might not even be released.</p>

              <p>It's partly due to missing jay chou's songs for over a year (he didn't release any album last year) and from sampling the new songs online, I'm anxious to get my hands on the album.</p>
              <p>But you're correct, I should have NOT pre-order....... for something as "common" as jay chou albums. I mean, all his old albums are still for sale in HMV.</p>

              <p>All he's saying is, the service staff is only human and you cannot expect her to be a complete automated robot throughout her entire shift. You worked in the service line before? If you did, can you touch your heart and say that you can keep your professionalism 100% intact for eight hours straight on every single shift?</p>
              <p>And strictly speaking, she did no wrong in such a situation, really - she did give the hypothetical customer exactly what he wanted.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, let this be a lesson to you: don't be such a goondu to place pre-orders. Seriously, what do you get out of it? A sense of satisfaction that you're one of the first people to buy it? What's the point of being so kiasu? Sooner or later, you're going to get what you want to buy anyway.Â <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>If you really want to know, I laugh at all the goondus who pre-order and try to be '<em>the first in line</em>'. Where possible, I let them other people buy first so that I can read their reviews and make a better-informed decision about my purchases.</p>
              <p>If it's not a life-or-death situation, there is really a lot of virtue to be gained from patience.Â <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>they are trying to clear the spore album stocks.Â  if they tell u got the taiwan album with 3d calendar, probably u won't buy the spore album version.Â  it's a sales tactic.Â  they care for their profits, not for customers.Â </p>
              <p>i can understd yr feeling of being cheated. next time don't rush to pre-order.Â  even tho jay chou's is hot cake, usually will hv stocks after release date de.Â  different versions come out after the release date too.Â  so u actually hv more choices if u wait a little.</p>
