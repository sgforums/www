              <p>Oh I get it.... the issue you have is with the HMV staff, right? You're sore that they didn't tell you about this new special release, right? Well, you ever tried keeping track of every single damn album in the store and possible future pressings and versions of each of them? Have you ever considered that the record company might not have told HMV about this new version until <em>after</em> you placed the preorder? Sheesh.</p>
              <p>And also, dollars to donuts say that one year from now, that damn calendar will end up as unwanted clutter that gives you no further utility. Mark my words.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, the very fact that you can even whine over something as banal as this speaks volumes of your maturity, or lack thereof.</p>

              <p>I was one of those who pre-ordered for jay chou's latest album
              with HMV. During that time (early May), we were given 2 options
              ONLY:</p>
              <p>1) metal box version with badges ($36)<br> 2) normal paper version with badges ($24)</p>
              <p>I chose the metal box version and paid the money. On 18 May, I
              collected the album.</p>
              <p>Then just yesterday, I walk past HMV and saw from their display
              outside that they have the Taiwan metal box version with calendar
              ($39). The 3D calendar version is a better one than some lousy
              badges. I was shocked and enquired the staff why they didn't
              mention at that time of pre-order that they have the Taiwan version
              with calendar so that customers can make a more informed
              choice.</p>
              <p>Guess what they tell me?? ----&gt; "Taiwan version only come
              now."</p>
              <p>I was sooooooooooooooooooo p1ssed!!! They mean, they didn't know
              that taiwan version is coming or suddenly HMV boss feel like it,
              then he order taiwan version??</p>
              <p>Not even saying sorry for misinformation, they still have the
              cheeks to tell me that to get the calendar, I have to buy again the
              album. WTF do I do with 2 albums????? Totally brainless and lack of
              EQ!!!!</p>
              <p>Never going to pre-order anything again from HMV!!!!!!!!!!!!!

              <p>What is it about, then? The CD? Well, you got your CD, right?

              <p>Oh I get it.... the issue you have is with the HMV staff, right?
                          You're sore that they didn't tell you about this new special
                          release, right? Well, you ever tried keeping track of every single
                          damn album in the store and possible future pressings and versions
                          of each of them? Have you ever considered that the record company
                          might not have told HMV about this new version until <em>after</em> you placed the preorder? Sheesh.</p>
              <p>And also, dollars to donuts say that one year from now, that
                          damn calendar will end up as unwanted clutter that gives you no
                          further utility. Mark my words.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, the very fact that you can even whine
                          over something as banal as this speaks volumes of your maturity, or
                          lack thereof.</p>
              <p>Even for a whiny teenage schoolgirl, this thread is totally
                          absurd. And to think that you are a full working adult.

              <p>If they do not have the ability to track every single album and its versions and manage customers tactfully, then they should not have bothered to set up a company.</p>
              <p>And, I still have the calendar from previous album, so what is there to mark your words?</p>
              <p>To you, it may be whining becos you're oh-so-mature and nothing in life will make you upset or angry which is good for you.</p>
              <p>This thread is not absurd as it is clearly a service lapse from HMV. In addition, they don't even bother to call customers when the release is postponed from 14th to 18th though when I asked them why they didn't contact me (hp no. field was in the preorder form) they claimed they "tried to call every customer and somewhere I wasn't contacted" (no calls from them and no miss call in my hp). This is how a company manage customers who paid in advance (thus having a responsibility towards them)?</p>

              <p>pre-order stuff are always like that. it's not HMV's fault nor

              <p>some things running at the back you won't know. of course you might not "sense" any effort, that doesn't mean there isn't any. anyway the cd you ordered was what you received, it's not like they gave you something else. so i don't see what's there to be angry about. the taiwan version was up on shelves when it was supposed to be up on shelves, the pre-order came with what it was supposed to come with. it's not like they have to tell you everything that's coming in for the next year regarding that album. i bought Eminem's relapse and then refill hit the shelves. i pre-ordered dave matthews band's big whiskey and then a version with 2 bonus songs came out when the cd first hit the shelves. it's not like i didn't get what i wanted in the pre-order (the dvd). so i guess, you can't really blame anyone.</p>

              <p>Wrong. It only ensures that you can get a copy once it's released. And you got what you ordered, so they did their job.</p>
              <p>The decisions to release deluxe editions later do not lay with the store but with the recording label - the same thing happened with a few artistes' albums a couple of years ago.</p>
