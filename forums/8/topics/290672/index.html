            <div class='col-md body'>IN the real world, what you see is usually what you get.<br><br>Miss Chua ordered a grey version of this top displayed on the Shoplah.com website.<br>But that's not always the case with online shopping.<br><br>Online clothing retailer Shoplah.com made more than $300,000 this year with the help of a strategy called viral online marketing.<br><br>Those who display the retailer's advertising banner on their websites and link to Shoplah.com get their delivery charges waived.<br><br>More than 200 people have taken up this offer.<br><br>But now some buyers are saying that what they received is not quite what was shown on the Shoplah site.<br><br>The retailer, a Singaporean company set up last year, says its online terms and conditions make it clear that the clothes will only be similar to what is shown on its website.<br><br>COMPLAINTS<br><br>A blog search turned up more than 20 personal blogs containing posts - complete with pictures - complaining about Shoplah.<br><br>-- Picture: CHOO CHWEE HUA<br>Disgruntled customers have also started discussions on online forums like Flowerpod, VR-Zone and Sengkang.com complaining about the company.<br><br>One customer, Miss Felicia Chua, 22, told The New Paper she received a top which was entirely different from what she had ordered online.<br><br>Miss Chua, a campaign coordinator, said she was excited that Shoplah carried clothing by Aidma, a popular Korean clothing brand.<br><br>She picked a grey 'Aidma' top with floral motifs which cost $26.<br><br>Instead, she received a top with a label which read 'Shanghai Xinzhixiou Fashion'.<br><br>She said: 'I paid for a pretty off-shoulder top, not something my late grandmother would wear.'<br><br>She wrote a complaint e-mail to Shoplah.com telling them she had not received what she paid for.<br><br>She was told that if she wanted to exchange her top for something else, she would have to pay an additional $4. 'And I have to pay for postage to send it back - it's ridiculous,' she said.<br><br>Others with similar experiences went online with their complaints.<br><br>Blogger Cassandra Cheok devoted an entire post to flaming Shoplah. She took photos of the items she received and compared them to the pictures on Shoplah's website.<br><br>She wrote that one item she bought was a blouse by Aidma.<br><br>'Mine comes with a different label called Korean Erxiu Fashion Industries.'<br><br>She paid about $24, which is what an Aidma top would cost.<br><br>When contacted, a spokesman for Shoplah said the company imports all its products from various parts of China, including Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen.<br><br>He said the site receives less than 10 customer complaints every month.<br><br>On the discrepancy between the online pictures and actual merchandise, the spokesman said there would always be customers who are unhappy because 'different customers have different expectations'.<br><br>'The pictures on our website are very nicely taken and there are bound to be slight differences on the actual items - for example, the item colour may look brighter in the picture than in real life due to strong lighting.'<br><br>But asked why the items' designs and brandnames did not tally, the spokesman would only say: 'As stated in our terms and conditions... all items will be 80 to 90 per cent similar to the pictures.'<br><br>Other online sales platforms like eBay and Yahoo Auctions rely heavily on their user communities.<br><br>Each user has a feedback profile, which includes basic information about the member and comments their trading partners have left for them.<br><br>CUSTOMER REVIEWS<br><br>The sites also rely on users to report items which infringe usage policies, such as counterfeit goods.<br><br>Such reviews can be influential.<br><br>One blogger, Evolna, decided against buying from Shoplah after she read reviews by shoppers who had negative experiences.<br><br>She wrote: 'I almost bought clothes from them, until I saw a girl writing about Shoplah in her blog.'<br><br>But Shoplah remains upbeat.<br><br>Said its spokesman: 'If our products do not meet some customers' expectations, we are sorry.<br><br>'There are still many other customers who are happy with our products, who return several times each month.'<br><br><a href="http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/news/story/0,4136,147178,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/news/story/0,4136,147178,00.html?</a><br><br>i read alot of complaints abt them<br>honestly anione here bought anithing from them? hw are the reviews<br><br></div>
