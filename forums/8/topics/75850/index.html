            <div class='col-md body'>Look, i think all ShiFeng wants is to be close to her, even though he hurts this way, it's the only way that maintains his chance of being with her in the future. It's hard to give up on a person and sometimes we just don't want to. I think he feels this way.<br><br>I'm just thinking, there's no harm in standing by SQ, is there? Right, in a pretty big extend she may be selfish, wanting to enjoy life while SF waits for her quietly, but the fact is that she bothers to tell SF her feelings for him.<br><br>(But then again it might just be a big lie. Damn! Women!!)<br><br>To SF:<br>So in a nutshell, whether or not you wana stand by her is up to you, but you must bear in mind that what will happen in the future is all up to her. You can't blame her for 'ditching' u nxt time, 'cuz she didn't make any promises to u.. It all depends on how much u trust her. If you can sense that she's more interested in another guy, the time has come for you to leave her. The leaving process will hurt a darn lot, but it won't hurt as much as if she leaves u after more years of waiting..<br><br>P.S: I still love my ex, and would do anything to have him back.. Been 10mth 19 days since we broke up.. We were together for 1yr 2 mth 2 days.. But ya, i'll leave him be..</div>

All I am offering is just another view - we can't always be encouraging someone when we know that the road is difficult without warning them. He can do what he likes with his life because it is his life.<br><br>But in the end? How will it be? How will it turn out?<br><br>P.S: Love is not a matter of counting the years...But making the years count. You can wait for 10 years, no problems with that. But then, so what? What's next? How many cases have I encountered from people with aimless waiting - in the end? When they understand the lesson behind this: they mature and realise why this happen. How many people have fed them with false hope? The fixed aspects in their astrological birth chart? Or pure karmic love?<br><br>Cheers</div>
