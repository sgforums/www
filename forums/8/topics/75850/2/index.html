Shifeng, I really feel so much heartache for you...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  (sob, sob)... Really makes me want to cry after reading your poem... I cry for you as I read your poem knowing that she may not truly understand the depth of your love for her. Because if she really does, she won't be indecisive and delay her response to you.<br><br>By the way, you should submit this poem of yours to http://www.poetry.com<br>Because I submited mine last mth and you know what??!! I can't believe it!!! I actually receive a positive reply from poetry.com<br>They send me a note to say that they accepted my poetry and it will be published in a book! I just got the mail today and right now I'm still in a daze... feel like I'm dreamin...<br><br>I mean my poem was very very simple, not as beautiful as yours... I wrote it out of the blue and just submit it online for fun without any hope that it is of any noticeable quality. And I can't believe it when the letter I received today states that my poem has been selected into the semi-finals! I'm still in a daze...<br>But hehe... if I do win some money, I will reward the person who was the inspiration to this poem of mine.<br><br>Anyway, I doubt mine will win any prize money at all.. but it sure feels good to have an international poetry body in the US actually acknowledging my poem.<br><br>I know you love her and you don't do this for money... but c'mon, man! You've got talent! Real talent! You shouldn't let it go to waste... Do something positive abt your heartache. You know, out of the darkest nights of the soul, beautiful poetries &amp; songs and music are birthed. (People even become renowned for their artistry). Well, ok, fame, money and success aside, atleast if you win some prize money, you can save it up to buy something really special for SQ.<br><br>Just a thot. I really really like your poem. I'm a poetry-nut.<br><br></div>
