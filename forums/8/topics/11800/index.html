Some examples... but make up your own more original =)<br><br>"Sweetheart, you have been the most important person in my life since I can remember, I want you to know that I love you, and I'll love you forever. Will you marry me?"<br><br>I think our relationship has come to a point of no turning back. I'm ready for the next step in life, and I want to take it with you. What I'm trying to say is, I love you, and I want to start a family with you. Will you marry me please?"<br><br>"Darling, you are the love of my life. You've been my girlfriend/boyfriend, my confidante, my best friend, my lover, you're the person who cheers me on and supports me in everything I do. I'm so happy when I'm with you. Will you marry me?"<br><br>"You're the most beautiful, intelligent, kind, wonderful person I've ever been with in my life. I can't imagine being another day without you. I want to be with you for the rest of my life. Will you marry me?"<br><br>"There was a time in my life when I thought I would always be lonely. You changed that. You made me see there was hope and faith and love. If you hadn't been around, I don't know where I'd be now. I love you. I need you. Will you marry me please?"<br><br>"We've known each other for a while now, and I feel a special connection to you. I think there's a reason why God let me meet you and fall in love with you. Honey, let's get married!"<br><br>"Darling, I would like to ask you something very important concerning our future together. I really hope you'll say Yes, because you're the most important person in my life, and I love you more than anything in the world. Will you marry me please?"<br><br>"Sweetheart, I've achieved everything a person could want in life. I've got a great career, great friends and a wonderful girlfriend. But there's one thing missing in my life, and it just wouldn't be the same without it. Do you know what it is? (wait for her to respond) I missing a wife. (Her name) I love you. Please marry me?"<br><br>"Honey, I know we've had our rough spots, and I know I've acted really stupid sometimes. But I want you to know, that I've always loved you, and I can't live without you. I'm willing to try and work out all our problems together. Will you marry me please?"<br><br>"What happened recently has made me think about a lot of things. About the fragility and preciousness of life. And I realise that you're the most important person in my life, and I want to treasure you, protect you, nourish you and love you. I want to be with you for the rest of my life. Will you marry me please?"<br><br>------------------<br>**I want u to be with me.....<br>be with me in the morning...be with me in the nite...with me when its dark out...with me when its light...<br>I want u to be with me...no matter what we do...just keep this reminder...of how much I love u...**</div>
