And that is all pretty girls are taken up just because all you see is pretty girls that are attached. To exaggerate your generalisation, it's like saying the entire world is fu<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>cked up just because USA is fu<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>cked up.<br><br>No offense man... but seeing many of the generalisation by our fellow forum-ers is just very very upsetting. The older people should be ashamed of themselves by saying stuff like how bad the generation after them suck so much. (Surprise surprise... most of them is by you) This only shows how much you actually think... which, i might honestly say, isn't much.<br><br>Just because you don't like it...  doesn't means that it sucks.
