You spare no thought to the reader. Your arrogance dictates that the reader must understand you, or else the reader is uneducated. Can you see your arrogance?<br><br>You eloquently string together some English words that look good, but are actually meaningless when taken as a whole.<br>You have shown that you are a hypocrite. The pot calling the kettle black.<br><br>You deny yourself. Your nick could be somebody else, remember. So where is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">your</span> credibility. So who cares if you are astounded or disgusted beyond belief. You could not be you.<br><br>You have absolutely no interest in good English. You only want to denigrate people. This you have shown in every post you make here, save one. This very fact exposes your mental state of affairs. Which everyone here knows what that is, I have stated it often enough. You are sick.<br><br>But you can get well.<br>This forum is good for you.<br>You repeatedly ignore my call to you to contribute positively to this forum. I understand that your mental state makes it impossible for you to be nice, but you can try. You are showing improvements, your standard of English is dropping. Purposely, I hope.
