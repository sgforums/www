You see, Singlish is what the Singaporean down the street speaks. Singlish helps break the ice between locals in awkward situations or even distract us from the real problem for some respite, such as talking about the humid weather while waiting 45 minutes for a bus. So all the posts before yours, were made tongue in cheek. <span style="font-style: italic;">TyPiNG Lik3 tHi5 iS</span> some people's way of expressing that they're having fun. That Singlish is as loose as it is functional. The point in Singlish is getting the message through is the least number of words. Stressing items with "lah", "leh", "meh", etc is our way of expression. We dun purposely want to speak Singlish. It's simply a natural occurence after having a mix of races grow exponentially in almost 200 years, a large majority of which with no formal education until affluent and religious societies start giving back to the public by establishing schools. Education was only emphasised after our independence. Even that took a while to make it compulsory. I remember in my 1988 Atlas, only 88% of Singaporeans are literate. So do forgive us if <span style="font-style: italic;">we talk liddat la, cos itz jus our way of hvg fun and getting the pt across lor.</span> What's worse is now the sms culture of shortening already shortened-words. It will take a while for the receiver to comprehend, but the sender is short of time, so he writes a quick one. Here's how bad it can probably get...<br><br>The actual message:<br>Shall we go Takashimaya Shopping Centre for some shopping. Afterwhich, catch a movie at Cineleisure?<br><br>Via MSN (online chat):<br>We go shop at Takashimaya? Then watch movie at Cineleisure?<br><br>Via Sms:<br>Taka shopping want? Then go CineL for movie?<br><br>Sms extreme:<br>TK shop tn Cine mov k?<br><br>I hope you get what I'm trying to express here...<br><br>As for half-baked Chinese. It's not all of our faults. My father has my generation of Primary 2 Chinese. My mum's Hokkien/Malay is better than her Chinese. I struggled alot, as I speak mainly English at home. I can only speak Chinese fluently if you allow me to speak it continuously for 24 hours. Spontaneous fluent Chinese is <span style="font-style: italic;">so not me</span>. In fact, sometimes the Chinese words I use are too profound to the local Chinese speaker, as I tend to remember the ones used in Chinese songs I listen to now and then.</div>
