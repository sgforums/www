Well, for anyone who is able to write up an essay COHERENTLY, with a proper sentence structure and reasonable grammar/spelling, I don't see why it is difficult to obtain an A grade. Which leads me back to my point about the standard of English in Singapore, and the reason why only a select few manage to obtain that grade. But then again, A1 in GP is nothing. [b]NOTHING</strong>. (Oh, and I hope your grade wasn't moderated up to an A1. Like 74.5 rounded off or something.) Even if you somehow manage to obtain 750 on the English component of your SAT1, that's just average. (I'm assuming you know what the SAT is...)<br><br>By the way, I don't give a s*** about what you think of my reply. FLUNK IN HUMILITY? Wake up and smell the roses dude. I don't know about you, but as far as I am concerned, the world doesn't revolve around Singapore. Singapore has to adapt and evolve in tandem the rest of the world.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Hey you just said Singaporeans know that they use Singlish and broken English and are PROUD of it. So obviously they DON'T think they EXCEL in the command of the language. <strong>Wake up</strong> and smell the coffee. Stop being so incoherent. DON'T contradict yourself in your writing.<br><br>The whole paragraph about how easy it is to get an A1 in GP is exactly why I despise the manner in which it is graded. Because people who mug and stick to rigid formats stand a higher chance of scoring as opposed to people who truly have a flair for writing. Your entire point about rounding off is totally irrelevant because all of us have NO idea what our exact scores are? And is that supposed to be a dig at me? You write like you are five. Either that, or drunk. Don't be so incoherent. I obviously know what SAT is. Was that supposed to be another lame attempt at insulting me? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>If you didn't give a s*** about my reply, then why did you bother writing up such a long retort?<br><br>Since the world doesn't revolve around you and your petty ideals, STOP imposing them on other people.<br><br>P.S After that reply, I take my back my word on giving a distinction on English.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

I know where I stand in the command of English. As for the contradiction you claimed, well, if you bother to read my initial post carefully, I was referring to the MOST, if not ALL the peeps <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HERE</span></strong> (in this forum), by virtue of their posts. In the later posts, the attention was turned to Singaporeans in general. I'm not sure if you even bother to read posts first before advancing a counter-argument, or that you just simply fail to comprehend the distinction.<br></div>

Since I'm not allowed to judge you, what makes YOU so special? So PLEASE don't act high and mighty and judge us based on forum posts.<br><br>ALSO, you are SO pretentious it really gets on my nerves.

Your standard of Mandarin is half-baked as well..."<br><br>This was in one of your first few posts. Notice you already involved <strong>Singapore</strong>.
