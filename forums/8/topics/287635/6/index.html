            <div class='col-md body'>dormito_ger,<br><br>you are very interesting.<br>it seems as if you can't even sense when a person is typing something on purpose. do you really think that guy would have so much time everyday just to type all those crap in numbers, letters and signs? it is so obvious that he typed that message on plain purpose, probably as a "fun" response to whatever's in this thread. i don't know and i don't need to know.<br><br>i have also not met anyone yet who boasts to me about his/her ability of being able to substitute numbers for words. that is just plain nonsense anyways. people do get "proud" about it on purpose, but nobody's really serious about it.<br><br>i do agree that the situation has worsened. but think about it. why?<br><br>with the integration of mobile phones and technlogical gadgets into our lives, i think there is nothing much wrong with the shortening words into numbers to save time and effort when trying to input long messages to be sent to another friend, because to me, it takes much more effort entering words into a mobile phone than to type it all out. instead of sms-ing "would you like to go out today?", for convinence's sake, many would rather sms "wan go out 2day?". short and sweet, and as long as it brings the message across, nobody really cares.<br><br>personally i do not agree with people typing "me" as "mi" and "is" as "ish" and even "sorry" as "solli". ultimately the point of using shorthand is to save time, not to encourage wrong spelling or even make the spelling of the word more.<br><br>however you seem to think that people would really get all mixed up with formal english and the english they speak/use everyday. i do admit that some of my friends, as a result of typing "you" as "u", has also written the word "you" as "u" in the exams. but, could you first even consider the chances of people substituting dialect, mandarin or even malay words in an English exam? we know jolly well how to differenciate english, malay, dialect and mandarin words. with the exceptional cases of students with extremely poor language abilities, i do not see any way in which how i or anyone even could integrate different languages into an essay meant to be of a single language (you could probably argue in dialouges but that's another totally different story).</div>

Your juvenile logic and eagerness to link race to this issue simply reflects your childish and racist mentality. Don't be a sore loser just because you can't outargue someone.
