            <div class='col-md body'>your quite right on this, in addition to that..<br><br>if you cant decide which one, let me summarize for u...<br><br>JC - don't go in there unless ur L1R5 is 12 or less...a comment by my fren...he is now struggling in yr 1, imagine a whole class getting Ds and Es for grades...<br><br>Jc is indeed stressful..if you wanna take the shortcut to uni..then go ahead...but only 80% of jc students get to uni..take note<br><br>Poly is of course all about team work...and group work..just think...if you work...you have partners to work with...so u have better learn first..poly is more inclined to the working society...Like wise if your in Jc...you will get used to theory...for the environment ur in is if u can study well then u r good...but in working society...your good doesn't mean your good..if your, = your team shld also produce good results...<br><br>all 5 poly are group work...<br><br>but personally i have another thing which i would like to add...not that i am advertising for Republic Poly...but after studying in there for 3/4 yr...i feel  that i have learnt a lot of things related to work...<br><br>in other poly...when i ask my frenz studying there about work...they just gave me a standard reply..depends on what grades i get lo...to decide what job...<br>for me...i know which field i wanna work on already even i am just going to go to yr 2 next yr...<br><br>more abt the difference in RP with the other 4 poly SP,NP,NYP,TP (no offence meant in any way)<br>RP<br>- similar to secondary/jc (time table standard 830am -4pm) everyday<br><br>- no homework to do after school dismiss..<br><br>- no exams which will leave a lot of ppl frustrated and nervous...<br><br>- class changes every semester...like wise if you get a new job, you have to have the ability to adapt into the environment FasT!! By doing so, you will become more independent and yet holds the required skills for you to start work immed after graduation...<br><br>- standard time table allows students to work while finishing their studies after school at 4pm.. (ideal for ppl who wanna work due to not enough pocket money or wanna support themself due to poor family background - i'm one of them)<br><br><strong>- since there is no homework, then what we do during class lessons is that they (facilitators - we dun address them as teachers nor lectures for they dun teach...they guide us and there is no Correct Answer...Like wise in Working society...there are always more then 1 ans...its all inside ur creativity that counts..) will mostly give us a problem related to working life and let us find the solution from the net or library..then everyday in school is research...and presentation... (50% of the grades taken into consideration as Daily Grades<br><br>- test once every 4 lessons per module...we will have a test...and this is 50% of the grades)</strong><br><br>- attendance, being punctual related things will be taken into consideration in daily grades...if absent for a few times then actions will be taken into the grades (daily grades)<br><br>- all students will only have a laptop..no textbooks no papers...all done online...so you don't need to worry about a heavy sch bag..<br><br>- starting next yr . RP moving to woodlands...meaning for ladies it's good news... = shopping during break times and after school...for gamers..you know what it means...<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by zanza:</div><div class="quote_body">You might want to conside the 2 different experiences you will get when chosing your path.<br><br>JC offers a more structured life , ie , morning everytime 715 in school 530 finish . The subjects that u study are more on the theory side and indepth .<br>The cert is also good for studies in the Uk , Australia ,and our NUS,NTU.<br><br>Poly life is not so structured, Classes can have 3 ,4 hrs in between , work is graded mostly in grp work with projects. The subjects are more hands - on and practical and you can go to work with the diploma , however , to get into a University , u will have to either work very very hard to be top 5 % ++ or have very deep pockets , can send you to US or London U that will take you because of those deep pockets .<br><br>Social Life is also different , in poly , there is more emphasis on Presentation and Grp work then Exams , you will have to learn how to work with people u don't like. But on the other hand, you will have more free time if you plan your time properly, students do have a lot of free time but what they choose to do with it is another matter.<br><br>JC is mostly like secondary school , there is a lot of classroom interaction between classmates but little else with other ppl.
