              <p>Hi all. Im on a project. So i would like some suggestions ffrom the forumers here. As you all know, teen sex and pregnancy has been increasing in Singapore. Care to share if you have any ideas on how to prevent it. What can you do to prevent teens from having sex. Not what the government can do, but wad can the people contribute?</p>

              <p><br>Lol. your project make it sound as if teen sex is as wrong as teen pregnancy. What's wrong with teens having sex in the first place? Just use proper and adequate protection and you can drastically minimise the risk of pregnancy lorh.</p>
              <p>No idea on how to prevent teen sex, cuz i don't think there's a need to in the first place.</p>

              <p>Then blame it on the society, where in jap and korea by the age of 18, most of them hv sex liao and we gal here even at 25 or 30 yo still virgin, why, because we think teen sex is not appropriate, which is wrong. Teens sex is enjoyable.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As a gal, i hv to study till perhaps 22yo inorder, be guai guai, then i hv to build a career, by 30yo, i may have established my career, then i look for bf, and that bf hv to be 30++ (unker), and due to busy work, cost and further upgrading, we may not want babies, then till 40s, we look back and say, what the hell are we doing. And bear in mind, most guy hv to serve NS, by the time, they ready for sex or marriage is 30yo liao, we are therefore one of the oldest marriage age in the world. And by 35yo, most guys seeing their counterpart divorcing will think remain single better, so marriage rate fall. And with guy staying single, we gal also remain single to enjoy life, therefore in the end, less marriage, and less baby, leading to lower population, more foreign talent and prc women.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore the govt need to review on why greying population is increasing and yet birthrate is falling, it is because they created a society that want top education, kiasee, kiasu, money, career, individualism and see teens sex as a forbidded and bad which in other countries, it is deem good for the country to produce good healthy babies, family bonding, and earlier grandmothehood leading to earlier maturity.</p>

              <p>Since you can't prevent teen sex, perhaps more can be done about preaching to teens the responsibilities and consequences of teen pregnancies?</p>
              <p>I recalled in the past, there had been campaigns where volunteers hand out condoms at clubs to promote safe sex, but i think to youngsters, it just encourages them more. Somemore, it gives them the impression that, 'since you gave me that condom, that means i'm allowed to have sex lah' this kind of mentality. First time, they use condom, subsequently not? Just my opinion here...</p>
              <p>Interesting project you have there, btw is there any help group that can go to secondary schools and give speeches about responsibilities of sex. Can get single mothers to share experiences to discourage teens. Not that i have anything against single mothers, but i feel they bear the most burden, physically, mentally and financially. </p>
