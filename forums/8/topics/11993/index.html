            <div class='col-md body'>According to Straits Times in June 23, the Japanese were interviewed after they watched the show 'Pearl Harbour'.<br><br>Very pissed off by their ignorance and self-patriotism.<br><br>Some of their comments on the show below:<br><br>"Seeing Japanese as enemies did not repel me because they were not potrayed as dehumanised villians."<br>- High School Student Mai Daigo, 17<br><br>"I was thinking that I should study history again because the movie portrays Japan as a bad nation."<br>-Magazine editor Tomoko Nakayama, 30<br><br>"I was told we had only bombed military ships and military depots, not killed fleeing civilians as shown in the film."<br>"I thought that part was exaggerated and I had mixed emotions in watching the film that potrayed Japanese as an enemy."<br>- Ms Yoko Mikami, 53<br><br>"We must be careful to remember that this movie is not really about the facts"<br>- Yoshiko Michita<br><br>What a bunch of fuckers. How will they feel if they find out their grandfathers actually mass murdered millions of innocent lives and raped countless girls ????<br><br>Really wish the Japanese read this posting !<br><br>[This message has been edited by SilverWings (edited 25 June 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Japan is a very prideful nation; always has been and always will be. This "excessive" pride may seem strange to non-Japanese, but it is a very prominant aspect of Japanese culture. For the government of Japan to say that their nation did horrible things during a war that they lost (damaging enough to their pride), could make the Japanese feel less proud about their nation and culture.<br><br>But do you really think that Japan is the only nation to hide aspects of war from its citizens?<br><br>US soldiers slaughtered innocent villagers in Vietnam. Chemical weapons test were done during Vietnam and the Gulf War, affecting not only US soldiers and innocent bystanders, but the offspring of these people (i.e. "Agent Orange").<br><br>Granted, the US (to some degree atleast) have admitted to these wrongs. But they too withheld the truth for US citizens.<br><br>It is reasonable to say that the Japanese should "bear all." But to do so would damage the nation as a whole.<br><br>Am I saying then that the truth should be withheld? No. But if it is to be released, it should not be done so in an abrubt and scrutinizing manner.</div>
