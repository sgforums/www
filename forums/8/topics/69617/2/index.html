Oh, today's her b'day, but even tho she lurrves chocolates, I wun buy her chocolates cosh they r Not on sale.  I'll buy her a diamond instead, even tho she refuses to wear diamonds, cosh there's a sale now.

What my meaning is, the florists and other gift makers are taking on this opportunity to rake in big bucks.  So why should you wanna go and pay for it? 100++ bucks for a bouquet of flowers? To me, its true that money isnt a big problem when it comes to the one u love, thats why i mention go and buy someone more precious like diamond ring if you wanna 'prove' ur love in a money sense.<br><br>And if u dont believe in spending lotsa money and is a romantic, maybe be creative and go plan something serious like a candle lit picnic on a beach, spend the night at home, write a love poem.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, V Day can be extremely special without fine dining @ restaurants (which r fully booked dunno how long in advance), etc.  Basically, on V Day, couples do like to exchange tokens of love, which may be a small gift, a card, etc...<br><br>The only thg tt spoils V Day is how pple can be v. mercenary, or in the case of bizs, how they can be such profiteering orgs.  Then again, look @ it from a biz's pt of view.  V Day is perhaps the ONE day some bizs can generate higher profit margins, i.e. giftshops, florists, etc.<br><br>I guess I'm more tolerant of V Day after seeing how OTHER profiteering bizs try to "con" pple into parting wif their hard-earned $, like those wedding boutiques, wedding photographers, etc.  Think abt it, how many times haf u heard, "It's once in a lifetime"???<br><br>My ans to them is always, "Yeah, it's once in a lifetime, so I choose to NOT bankrupt myself for tt special day".<br><br>This seems irrelevant, but how many of us actually falls for these con artistes' lines?  Yet, we go abt bashing V Day, which pales in comparison to the thousands forked out for tt "Once In A Lifetime" hoohaa? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Juz a thot : )<br><br>RP<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by karn123:</div><div class="quote_body">no prob  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Well, i guess i didnt explain myself clear enuff...<br><br>I am actually agreeing with u 100% on this.
