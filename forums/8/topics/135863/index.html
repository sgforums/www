            <div class='col-md body'>Today, I was driving along AYE with my mum towards the direction from Jurong Town Hall towards NUH. When I was just past the Clementi Flyover, my mum noticed two pastel blue Kia Picantos driving side by side on the relatively clear traffic expessway, one on the middle lane (Lane 2) and one hogging the overtaking lane (Lane 1). Why hogging? It's because when I approached the two Picantos on the first lane, I had to decelerate from 100km/h to 70km/hr. Noting that the traffic was relatively easy, and there weren't any vehicles in front of the hogging Picanto with number plate SFN xxxY, and having a taxi behind me closing in and a MPV behind the taxi, I decided that I had to notify the front driver that, well, he was moving a lil too slow. So I flicked my high beam once. No response. So, thinking that the Picanto being a 1.1L vehicle might not be abl to accelerate that easy, I waited. By this time, the taxi is already behind me moving as slowly as me. There was clear space on front of the Picanto on the middle lane, but the one in front of me, SFN xxx Y, stuck to lane 1. I managed to move at around 80km/h, but the situation was not better. So I flicked my high beam again, twice this time. No response. And the front driver didn't pick up. Noticed a lorry on the middle lane in front so I decided to give him a chance to clear the lorry first. Past the lorry already, by this time already reaching the NUS flyover, he stll stuck to lane 1. So I decided to sound my horn twice. No movement. Frustrated, and since the front driver refuse to move, I shall overtake from the left (middle lane). Who knows, after I signalled and started to do the lan change, he swerved into the middle lane. Out of shock I swerved back to lane 1 and accelerate past him. It was definitely not a friendly gesture. And to think, once I drove past him, he swerved back to lane 1, now behind me, and flashed high beam. But being the taxi right behind me before this, he had to swerved back into middle lane. I was very shocked at this kind of gesture, as if he were to mean that he owned the first lane and with me flashing my high beams at him and the horn, I was being rude. What an act! And all these happened not say in a congested traffic but a relatively easy one! I cannot believe it! And to think of all the claims that we are supposedly to be more well-educated than most of the people around the world. What a let down! I feel so ashamed of this act by a fellow Singaporean, apart from the rude awakening that Singaporeans are, in fact, less well-mannered than our counterparts in other countries! Stop talking about being higher class, focus on the upbringing of the people!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Familiar? I am new!<br>And I need to warn the people! Though I think that putting up the number plate is not very good, but be careful of this driver! Cause I think he made the taxi behind him to perform an emergency brake procedure.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm, I probably would have taken it that when the limit is 90 going at 100km/h on a relatively empty road would be alright? Maybe you are right, I was going too fast.</div>
