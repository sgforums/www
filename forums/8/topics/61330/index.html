            <div class='col-md body'>generally speaking, i happen to have the impression (which means i can be wrong, i'm not flaming here) that singaporean gals are not very gracious in handling relationships, especially when it comes to breaking up or rejecting guys.

Which makes it so difficult to remain friends after getting rejected. Don't like nvm what, can always be friends. Then again, most singaporean guys don't have the maturity to handle that, a girl being friendly or nice to them doesn't mean they like them back. Especially since usually, singapore girls are very mean or cold to the guys they reject. So when a girl is nice to a guy even after she has rejected him, the guy tends to think he still has a chance.<br><br>I like my bike too. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Be generous about it - only the self-absorbed reacts this way. Seriously speaking, there are people who are rejected, but still feels cool about it, especially prior before was a great friendship. Only in such scenarios can a friendship be retain; if either one avoids and acts weirdo, this friendship is often ruin.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Widen your mind - you see things better this way.<br><br>Cheers</div>
