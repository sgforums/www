I find it sometimes quite useless to  argue about such past. What do you wish to achieve from there? Right and wrong? Many a time things ain't that clear, and even when things are clear people might be relunctant to admit mistakes... To generate more arguements? Flames? Wars? To let HISTORY REPEATS itself...?

            <div class='col-md body'>Free thinker doesn't mean u take the word literally :s<br><br>My own definition is it means one does not believe in the existence of something supernatural which cannot be prove correct.<br><br>I believe in physic textbook but not stories from bible, Quran or the religious book etc. Being free thinker is not equal to don't believe in anything. It doesn't means free thinker like free things either.<br><br>And being free thinker doesn't mean one has no morals. We fit into society and knows the actions we did will affect other people living in our society. In fact if one feel tat freethinker has no morals, then it means the person who say tat did something good just because they wanted something good in return. They try not to do something bad because they fear there will be punishment after their death. <strong>In my opinion, they seems to have lesser morals since they did something not because they want to help tat person, but because they expect some form of reward back. </strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by DeadPoet:</div><div class="quote_body">Actually how do you define a free thinker anyway? ?</div></blockquote>talk_cockÂ’s crap:<br><strong>"All are free to think; few are free from thought."</strong><br><br>Freethinkers are supposed to be free in their thinking, but to be really free in your thinking, you must firstly free yourself from your own thinking. In this respect, there are very, very few freethinkers. Most of them are people who think they are freethinkers, similarly there are those who think that they are atheists, Buddhists, Christians, Hindus, Muslims, Taoists, etc. They think they are but they are not. Socrates and Confucius were both great thinkers / philosophers, but they are never as highly regarded as Jesus or Buddha.<br><br>A philosopher thinks and makes elegant theories but has no definite answers. Socrates was once asked whether he feared death. His reply, Â“If it is really the end, then I do not exist anymore, if it is not the end, then I continue to exist. So there is no need for me to fear.Â” Very clear thinking, but he doesnÂ’t know, to be crude, he is guessing. Spiritual greats like Krishna or Lao Zi are not thinkers, they are knowers.<br><br>Have you ever read a poem, listened to a song, seen a beautiful drawing,etc, and concluded that the creator must have a beautiful character, but when you meet this person you see that he / she falls short of your expectations? How could such a beautiful thing come from such a mean fellow? That person thinks beautifully and becomes beautiful in thought, then he express his thoughts in his creations. But if you meet a Buddha or a Christ, the thought and person mirrors exactly. Buddha was a beggar, Jesus was among the poor, but they are knowersÂ—they know who they are, where they come from and where they are going. On meeting them, a king feels like a beggar and a beggar feels like a king. That is why in their time, they could attract such a large following and are revered even now.<br><br>To be a freethinker is very difficult, IÂ’ve tried but IÂ’ve not quite succeeded. It is very easy to be a thinker, but much harder to be a knower. In this sense, an atheist who knows that God does not exist, a godly person who knows that God exist and a freethinker who is free from thinking are really the same. If you REALLY know, then you will know why Buddha say that there is no God, why Jesus say that there is God, and why Krishna says that he is in all Gods.<br><br>More talk_cockÂ’s crap:<br><strong>"If you know, you do not need to think.<br>If you think, you do not really know."</strong><br><br></div>

It is very easy to be a thinker, but much harder to be a knower. In this sense, an atheist who knows that God does not exist, a godly person who knows that God exist and a freethinker who is free from thinking are really the same. If you REALLY know, then you will know why Buddha say that there is no God, why Jesus say that there is God, and why Krishna says that he is in all Gods.<br><br>More talk_cockÂ’s crap:<br><strong>"If you know, you do not need to think.<br>If you think, you do not really know."</strong><br><br>[/b]</blockquote>I really like your posting, especially this part. Just curious, did you wrote it yourself?  Or did you got it from somewhere?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br></div>
