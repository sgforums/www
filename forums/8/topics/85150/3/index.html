But no politically correct types answers please. Just true answers from your hearts.)<br><br>Guy A and Guy B are equal. Not equal as in identical but equal in the sense that you  find both equally desirable. The only difference is their financial standing. Let us put it this way Â– you marry Guy A you will live in a huge condo and be driven around in a 2.4 litre Toyota Camry but if you marry Guy B you will live in a 3-storey bungalow and be driven around in a BMW 7-series. So you tell us Â– let us not be hypocrites Â– you tell us go for Guy B.<br>Ok, so both of you fall deeply in love (you and Guy B). The world suddenly seems such a wonderful place Â– your dreams have finally come true. You have finally FOUND LOVE in guy B.<br><br>Now Guy C comes along! Wallets aside Â– compared to Guy B, Guy C is no where near Guy B. You can never fall in love with Guy C. But Guy C starts to woo you and eventually you find out that he is actually a  rich manÂ’s son. A very very very very rich manÂ’s son. Marry guy C and you CAN HAVE everything a girl would ever want. But remember you are in love with Guy B.<br><br>Would you DUMP Guy B for Guy C?<br><br>I am a guy so I really do not know how to answer.
