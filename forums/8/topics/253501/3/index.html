            <div class='col-md body'>Geez! How come u can be so dumb to listen to what people say?!!!! (No offence) hahaaha!<br><br>Come on!<br><br>Honestly speaking, every one in the best class is USUALLY very competitive. I know that, because I was in triple-science too. I remember when people ask me how I did so well and all... I'll just say "by luck lor...or I'm surprised myself!"<br><br>However, don't condemn me yet. Some times I would 'reveal my secrets', if that fella is doing very poorly and seriously need help, and i feel that he poses no threat to my position, I would lend that helping hand. I mean, if you look at my point of view, I'm being selfish for my own good - would it be good for me if i revealed my study techniques to people who asks and later have them surpass me? Perhaps another point of view is that after revealing one's secret, he/she would then be compelled to find new methods in order to stay on top; hence improving continuously.<br><br>You must understand that everyone is selfish in one way or another.  It's the same everywhere</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I most certainly disagree with the TS.<br><br>Only in the best class can you take triple science, or biology for that matter.<br><br>And for me, I made it a part of my aspiration to have a career as a doctor or a vet in the future, for I want to heal people/animals. However, not being able to qualify for the best class (as you all might probably know, sec 2 that time is when a lot of people still haven't mature one) meant that I've missed the chance of taking up biology.<br><br>And as a result of that, I do not qualify for biology in JC (where I'm in now), neither will I be able to pursue related course in the university later on.<br><br>So you can see how not going to the best class changed the course of my life (but of course, I'm mostly at fault for playing a fool around at that time)<br><br>IMO, how happy you are in school/class depends little on your classmates. Happiness is something that only you can grant to yourself, not your classmates. How can their immature behaviour affect you as long as you chose to maintain your focus on your studies?<br><br>So why let childish people like that affect your future and what you want to do? Is it worth it? Certainly not!<br><br>As you move on to tetiary education in the future, you can only witness more of such intense and violent competition between you and your so call 'friends' (I don't know about poly, but at least for JC I know that's true). And I believe this applies even more for the universities and the working world especially.

            <div class='col-md body'>Going to a triple science class has its pros and cons.<br><br>In a Triple Science class, you get the best of everything. You get the best teachers, best priority in other areas, you get all the external opportunities be it Maths Olympiad or some other projects. Because you are supposedly the 'Cream of the Crop'. And of course, you have a good learning environment.<br><br>Last year, a team of five from the triple science class took part in the National Weather Study Project, and they won first place - winning a trip to Australia and some SGD$5k. Of course, this made some grumble from other classes.<br><br>Nonetheless, i have noticed alot of the cons surfacing from triple science classes. They tend to be too orderly during lessons - their tables are arranged neatly closed to perfection, and when you walk past their class, mostly silence is heard. There seems to be a lack of life and fun in there.<br><br>Oh, and most importantly. The competitive studying environment. People tend to me more hypocrite in there, they hide their 'secret techniques' to effective studying, they don't share any tips for the upcomng exams, and the ranking system is super pressuring.<br><br>I have a CCA friend in the triple science class who actually has a list of peers he wants to beat for the exams. And he crosses out them one by one. And another who is super pressured as he is in the bottom-five of his class, but at level standard he is at top 70. And another, leaves maths script blanks and have to visit the shrink weekly. You can obviously see the stress out there.<br><br>I'm lazing to type more about being in other classes.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Oh, i'm from a class branded 'full of potential to exploit and made of cca leaders, yet lazy academically.'</div>

However, not being able to qualify for the best class (as you all might probably know, sec 2 that time is when a lot of people still haven't mature one) meant that I've missed the chance of taking up biology.<br><br>And as a result of that, I do not qualify for biology in JC (where I'm in now), neither will I be able to pursue related course in the university later on.<br><br>So you can see how not going to the best class changed the course of my life (but of course, I'm mostly at fault for playing a fool around at that time)<br><br>IMO, how happy you are in school/class depends little on your classmates. Happiness is something that only you can grant to yourself, not your classmates. How can their immature behaviour affect you as long as you chose to maintain your focus on your studies?<br><br>So why let childish people like that affect your future and what you want to do? Is it worth it? Certainly not!<br><br>As you move on to tetiary education in the future, you can only witness more of such intense and violent competition between you and your so call 'friends' (I don't know about poly, but at least for JC I know that's true). And I believe this applies even more for the universities and the working world especially. The things you see in secondary school is nothing compared to these.<br><br>Still, there's always light within the darkest room.</div></blockquote>I feel that the system is forcing us to choose our career at Year 9 (Sec 2). Not a very nice feeling.<br><br>It is better to make career choices at 24 because one is much more matured and calm at this stage.</div>
