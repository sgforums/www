            <div class='col-md body'>It hurts to love someone and not be loved in return,<br>but what is most painful is to love someone<br>and never finding the courage to let the person know how you feel.<br>Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one<br>so that when we finally meet the right person,<br>we should know how to be grateful for that gift.<br>Love is when you take away the feeling, the passion, the romance -<br>and you find out you still care for that person. A sad thing about life<br>is when you meet someone that means a lot to you, only to find out in the end,<br>that it was never bound to be and you just have to let go.<br>When one door of happiness closes, another opens but often we look<br>so long at the closed door that we don't see the one<br>which has been opened for us. The best kind of friend<br>is the one you could sit on a porch, and swing with, never say a word,<br>and then walk away feeling like that was the best conversation you've had.<br>It's true that we don't know what we've got until we lose it,<br>but it's also true that we don't know what we've been missing until it arrives.<br>Giving someone all your love is never an assurance that they'll love you back,<br>don't expect love in return, just wait for it to grow in their<br>hearts but if it doesn't, be content it grew in yours.<br>There are things you love to hear but you would never hear<br>it from the person from whom you would like to hear it,<br>but don't be deaf to hear it from the person who says it with his heart.<br>Never say goodbye when you still want to try , never give up when<br>you still feel you can take it, never say you don't love that person<br>anymore when you can't let go. Love comes to those who still hope,<br>even though they've been disappointed, to those who still believe ,<br>even though they've been betrayed, need to love those who still love<br>even though they've been hurt before. It takes a minute<br>to have a crush on someone, an hour to like someone and a day to love someone,<br>but it takes a lifetime to forget someone. Don't go for looks, it can deceive,<br>don't go for wealth, even that fades away. Go for someone who makes you smile<br>because only a smile makes a dark day seem bright. Hope you find that person.<br>There are moments in life when you really miss someone<br>that you want to pick them from your dreams and hug them for real.<br>Hope you dream of that someone. Dream what you want to dream,<br>go where you want to go, be what you want to be, cause you have only one life<br>and one chance to do all the things you want in life.<br>May you have enough happiness to make you sweet,<br>enough trials to make you strong, enough sorrow to keep you human,<br>enough hope to make you happy and enough money to buy me gifts<br>Always put yourself in other's shoes. If you feel that it hurts you,<br>it probably hurts the person, too. A careless word may kindle strife,<br>a cruel word may wreck a life, a timely word may level stress,<br>a loving word may heal and bless. The beginning of love is to let those we love<br>be perfectly themselves, and not to twist them with our own image,<br>otherwise, we love only the reflection of ourselves we find in them.<br>The happiest of people don't necessarily have the best of everything<br>they just make the most of everything that comes along their way.<br>Happiness lies for those who cry, those who hurt, those who<br>have searched and those who have tried. For only they can appreciate<br>the importance of people who have touched their lives.<br>Love starts with a smile, develops with a kiss and ends with a tear.<br>The brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past,<br>you can't go on well in life until you let go of your past<br>failures and heartaches. When you were born, you were crying<br>and everyone around you was smiling, live your life so that when you die,<br>you're smiling and everyone around you is crying.<br><br>------------------<br>I neber gave them heLL...i just told them the truth and they think it's Hell...</div>
