Sep and Oct they gave out another 5.8cts or $58 thats over $200 in the bank already, And now at year end the stock is above $2.90 thats how many % capital gains already + the dividend you collected leh? How many % return.<br><br>And this is not only happening this year but so far every year is like that. Come Jan/Feb they will announce results FY 2005 and again pay fat dividends that will make headlines.<br><br>If you collect abt 5-10 lots, if you lucky they keep paying huge dividend in 7-8 years you would probably own the stock for free already. After dat every year they keep paying $2k+ can go free holiday to thailand <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I don't really like Telco like M1 or Singtel or Starhub reasoning is telcos have very very high capital expenses and employ thousands of people. Very high cost.<br><br>If you want dividend look for businesses that do rental of assets like tiongwoon cranes or comfort taxi.<br><br>No vested interest in comfort or tiongwoon.</div></blockquote>i see... i understand what u mean.. hmm.. interesting.. okie~ i start buying sgx from now onwards!! i got share builder plan from poems~! heh heh.</div>
