            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Chapter Two: The Brits Arriveth</strong><br><br>By the 19th century, the British, Dutch, Portuguese, French and Manchester United had managed to put dozens of countries under their often tyrannical rule. There was as much bickering as there was signing of treaties between these empires. For example, the British and French agreed to put aside their differences and just get along for once, though this treaty did not last very long. It ended abruptly when Sir William G. Farquhar (great-grand-uncle of the Farquhar we all we know) and his French diplomatic counterpart Pierre-Luc Â“Viva laÂ” GastÃ³n met in Geneva to sign the cessation-of-hostilities documents. GastÃ³n took offence to Sir William introducing himself as Â“FarquharÂ” and Sir William was gravely insulted by GastÃ³n bringing his mother (Â“Mother FarquharÂ”) into the whole thing. A brief swordfight broke out which the French won 3-2 in extra-time after GastÃ³n unleashed his trademark move, Â“Le Kique a la GrÃ³in.Â” The King of England immediately declared that the French language would henceforth be referred to as Â‘FreedishÂ’.<br><br>The Dutch and the Portuguese, not to be outdone, signed a ground-breaking treaty that guaranteed amongst other things that, a) the Dutch would get some of the Portuguese territories for nothing, b) the Portuguese would comprehensively defeat the Dutch at hopscotch to get it back, and c) neither nation would win a World Cup in any sport, no matter how good their teams were.<br><br>About that time (9:34 pm), the British realised that they needed to change their strategy if they wanted to remain as the largest empire on the planet. You see, the other European countries were catching up with them in terms of territorial possession and a quick investigation into the matter by the KingÂ’s Counsel revealed the reasons for this: It seemed that recreational activities were the cause of the English peopleÂ’s inability to expand their empire. While the other European countries played a morning football match and went on with the exploration and expansion after that, the British were caught up playing Cricket. TheyÂ’d be out of bed at sunrise and on the pitch earlier than those other blokes, but the game would drag on until the scheduled lunch-time break, whereupon the players would head off for lunch, only to return an hour later to resume play. Then they would carry on with their hectic involvement in Â‘oversÂ’ and Â‘foursÂ’ and Â‘leg-before-wicketsÂ’ until their next scheduled tea-break. After tea, more cricket would follow until sunset. By then the British explorers would be so weary from standing still in the sun that they stumble onto their ships, chart a course to their next destination and steer their ships into the nearest cliff face. Â“Six!Â” the umpire would cry, having seen the playersÂ’ marbles cross the boundary. The Welsh, however, abstained from such recreational activities because of the ongoing vowel shortage that was plaguing the cntrysd. They did, however, reinvent the wheel in the late 18th century, a feat that has long been recorded as the least important in the history of mankind.<br><br>The King of England, meanwhile, realised that the British East India company needed to find a suitable port-of-call (so called because calls would port there) in South-East Asia so that merchant ships from India could refit and refuel themselves for the arduous journey to China. China was a goldmine for British merchants, who thronged there by the hundreds and thousands. Months of digging and sieving ensued (which created what is known today as the Gobi desert) and after realising that there was no gold in China, the merchants decided to sell whatever they had left (Clothing, Tobacco, Premier League jerseys, their dignity, etc.) to buy a trip back home. On the basis of this, trade soon flourished between the two countries and the need for a stop-over became increasingly evident.<br><br>The British East India CompanyÂ’s head office, led by the Governor-General of India, Lord Hastings, hastily gave Sir Stamford Raffles, the Lieutenant-Governor of Bencoolen and his trusty aide, Major Farquhar, tacit approval to take his ship (Â“The Flaming LamborghiniÂ”) with its crew to establish a trading post on the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula. The Dutch East India Company too, had intended to set up a trading post at a similar location to complement their assets in the East Indies and Spice Islands, but just as they were formalising plans to race ahead of the British, a keen bystander observed that the Dutch West India Company had gone missing. A thorough search set the Dutch back by 150 years and even then, the British had to drop hints that it had been left somewhere near the Caribbean before they could find it.<br><br>After touring several islands and taking notes, Raffles came to the largest island so far on his journey. An extract from his logbook read as follows:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">28th January 1819</span><br>We arrived at a small island that was covered with dense jungle. A small settlement greeted our eyes, as well as a crude harbour and a handful of small, primitive boats. Initially, I suspected it to be a fishing village, but on closer observation, Farquhar and I concluded that the settlers were slightly more advanced than mere fisherman. As we neared, a large sign over the harbour became visible through the fog. As we strained to read its seemingly foreign characters, it suddenly dawned on me that the sign was in English! I was startled, to say the least. An English-speaking settlement, here? I could not believe my eyes. I read the sign out loud to my crew. It said, Â‘Tekong Ferry TerminalÂ’ in big, bold letters. When our ship was within touching distance, we suddenly heard shots ring out from deep within the jungle. Cries filled the night sky and the thunderous rumbling of a thousand hoofed Gods struck fear deep into our hearts. We fled in our Indiaman, as fast as she could go. By midnight, we were out of view of that treacherous island, and thankfully so. However, in our haste, we have run aground on the larger island just opposite. Bother.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">29th January 1819</span><br>Woke up today with a terrible hangover after yesterdayÂ’s misadventures. I was dribbling from the mouth and Â‘God Shave the QueenÂ’ was playing in my head. She needs one, really. Ah well, on to pressing matters. Farquhar and I realise that we have stumbled onto an island much larger than the previous one. Small fishing villages line its shores and the people go about their daily chores with considerable glee. ThereÂ’s no sense of time but day and night and each oneÂ’s impending arrival. Carefree, they are, and the joy they seem to experience from just living is beyond any measure I have ever come across. Pity we have to wreck this place and kick the poor sods out. Ah wellÂ… the things I do for Her.<br><br>Raffles introduced himself to the locals and was led to the Temenggong (the village head) of the island where he concluded a preliminary treaty to set up a trading post without having to annihilate the village and kill everyone. Temenggong AbduÂ’r Rahman even offered to throw in his shiny jewellery. Such was the respect the villagers had for Sir Stamford Raffles, Major Farquhar, the British explorers and their large, dangerous guns.<br><br>On February 6th, a formal treaty was concluded with Sultan Hussein of Johor and the Temenggong, the de jure (meaning Â‘in judicial contextsÂ’) and de facto (meaning Â‘in fact-oÂ’) rulers of Singapore respectively. The British moved in soon afterwards and peace, calm and a slower pace of life came with them as well. By that we mean that all they did was play cricket.<br><br>The fisherman, however, were Â‘recruitedÂ’ by the British to help build settlements and make significant contributions to the infrastructure of the fledgling country, while the British themselves were trying to figure out how many Â‘oversÂ’ and Â‘ballsÂ’ they had left to get through with before their next scheduled tea break. Word-of-mouth news of the new trading post spread like wildfire fanned by evil, winged demon-goddesses from the vile, putrid depths of Hades. Naked demon-goddesses.<br><br>Within a year, Singapore was earning revenue, even though it came primarily in the form of toll payments collected from passing merchant ships that wanted to take a peek at the demon-goddesses. Three years more and its trade surpassed that of Pahang which had, for years, banked on its acclaimed attraction, Â‘Gimpy, the Lost VikingÂ’. Three more treaties, one Anglo-Dutch, one Anglo-Malay and one Mayo-Mustard resulted in the British having absolute control over Singapore in return for less flogging, increased payments, pensions and a side order of fries.<br><br>The British began to profit greatly from their newest trading post. Singapore would prove to be a vital possession of the British in Asia. They did, however, briefly lose Singapore to the Japanese close to 130 years later, though Singapore ended up playing a critical part in stopping the Japanese ArmyÂ’s expansion southwards during World War II. This was, in part, due to the fact that the Japanese Army had run out of south to expand into. Despite this set-back, they managed to defeat the British army and its allies comprehensively. The fierce one-week resistance that the British put up before fleeing for their pasty-skinned lives is testament to the resilience and resolve that saw them through more than 130 years of calm and prosperity.</div>
