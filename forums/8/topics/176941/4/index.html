            <div class='col-md body'>I suggest you bring this up to Straits Times. It is a really big matter; bigger than those letters right there now about "delay school opening hours" and ";et students go toilet if they really need to".<br><br>And include in the letter the organization you are working with -- probably NKF? Instead of writing via snail mail you can send via email to the  "Online Letters" thing. The title of all online letters will still be published in the newspaper, but not the content only.<br><br>Make the title catchy. Like, "Why set minimum amount for CIP donation drive?", and make the content attack the people who did that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[quote]Originally posted by jianfish9:<br><strong>I think to force people to do CIP is quite lame.</strong><br><br>I agree. In the end it puts a limit to what you can do.<br><br>if you really want to help people, then you put in real effort to do it.  It isn't just because you 'finish' your quota liao, then no need to put effort into it.<br><br>And if you are really looking at it, 5 hours of contributing your time in how many months?! You eat lunch also take more time than that liao.<br><br>Put yourselves in the shoes of the charity organisers. Let's say you spent some time and effort to administrate and organise a flag day. You use student volunteers because it can help them achieve their CIP, as well as help you cos you need volunteers. However, some students are doing it simply to fulfil their CIP hours, and do a shoddy job, or maybe even 'keng' time off when they supposed to collect donations. They come back with their tins hardly filled or far less than that the targeted amount, and there are people WAITING for these donations to make their lives a little better. You can't organise another flag day soon cos there are only this many flag days available for soooo many charities. the entire flag day becomes a failure cos insufficient donation is collected.<br><br>However, I do agree they handled the situation less than favourably. What they SHOULD have done is perhaps not to forfeit ALL 5 hours, but to give you a 'portion' of your time in accordance to the amount you collected. They should also tell you before hand that this is a target amount, after which your time will be discounted. Perhaps you can give these suggestions to your teacher that can reflect back to the charity org.<br><br></div>
