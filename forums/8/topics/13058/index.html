            <div class='col-md body'>I don't know whether any of you guys read this, but there was an article run some time ago about the culture prevalences in Singapore. They focus on ah bengs and the lot.<br><br>Seriously, the word 'ah beng', not to mention 'ah lian' and the rest may seem no longer just to represent a small grp of people but rather to reflect a certain kind of lifestyle, just like 'hippies' were in the 60-70s.<br><br>Another way to look at it would be that, these people are just trying to look for an outlet of expression, something from which to express their identity, to make they feel belonged. Singapore is fast progressing in all areas, especially so in the age of globalisation. We ar the pot pourri of cultures. A melting pot of identities.<br><br>People tend to get lose inthe jungle out there.
