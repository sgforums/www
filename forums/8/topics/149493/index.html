The information will be updated weekly.<br><br>NEA has also been recruiting more field inspectors this year - from 110 to 360. A further 150 will be recruited in the next two months.<br><br>By year end, there will be over 500 inspectors - four times more than the number last year.<br><br>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim, Environment and Water Resources Minister, said: "We will work with the town councils to see whether they can hire dedicated pest control operators, which means there is an operator that they have hired that will do more flushing of the drains, fogging, clearing of the sites. Because you have to check constantly the pump rooms, the water tanks, because all these are common areas."<br><br>So far, Jurong, Hong Kah and Sembawang Town Councils have hired dedicated pest control operators targeting the breeding sites found in common areas.<br><br>Although more households may be aware of dengue, this has not been translated much to action.<br><br>The number of breeding sites at construction sites has fallen to 9 percent, but that in residential homes was down by only 5 percent to 55 percent.<br><br>So the government is calling on all Singaporeans, including community organisations and condominium operators, to play their part.<br><br>Dr Yaacob said: "On our part, NEA is prepared to work to spend money, to play our part but we cannot do it alone, we have to do it with our partners so Singaporeans, community organisations, town councils, condominium operators will have to play their part together with us."<br><br>The Health Ministry is also working with doctors who had dengue patients to help identify the infected places.<br><br>In July this year, the NEA announced it would spend $10 million on dengue prevention measures - putting up posters at bus-stops and MRT stations. - CNA/de</strong><br></blockquote>The question now arises if the average Singaporean is concerned about these things or has enough time just to worry about bread and butter issues? Something as trivial as mosquitos are everywhere and dengue spreading mosquitos will always be there. U cant probably mess around with mother nature.<br><br>What if there is another outbreak , another 7.5 million to be spent?<br>If u know what steps are being taken in other countries to curb such epidemicsm, Singapore will probably become a laughing stock. In western countries they are cross breeding a new species of predatory mosquitos which can wipe out the degue causing varieties. And it doesnt even cost a million dollars in fund to do it. It is being done by students themselves.Their freedom is not stifled by the meritocracy system which is found here and thus encouraging new ideas and unfound talents which eventually make the world a better place for us to live in.<br>Why are the so called top elites in Singapore braindead? Is this why they are paid million dollar salaries?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>More dengue cases despite $10m spent on preventive measures<br>By Hasnita A. Majid, Channel NewsAsia<br><br>SINGAPORE : Some $10 million have been spent on dengue preventive measures for the first half of this year - a million more than for the same period last year.<br><br>The National Environment Agency said the additional funds were for dengue prevention outreach programmes such as putting up posters at bus-stops and MRT stations.<br><br>Yet the number of dengue cases has not been letting up, and neither is the fight against the Aedes mosquito.<br><br>Every month, 71-year-old Satwant Kaur vigilantly applies granular insecticide in her flat's bamboo pole holders - a potential mosquito breeding ground.<br><br>These granules, which last three to six months, can kill mosquito larvae.<br><br>She is one of 1,200 residents in Marine Crescent who have been given dengue prevention tools, which include bamboo pole caps.<br><br>It is part of an effort named "Anti-Dengue Fever Campaign" initiated by the Mayor Matthias Yao in February 2005 to wage an all-out war against dengue.<br><br>Dr Chua Ee Chek, Chairman of Marine Parade CCC, said: "I would say that our efforts had paid off. First, we have managed to convince the dengue prevention group volunteers that it is a worthwhile efforts to go around the neighbourhood to spread the message of dengue prevention.<br><br>"So, we have been quite successful. Our grassroots leaders have been quite convinced and they have in turn convinced the residents."<br><br>Environment and Water Resources Minister Yaacob Ibrahim said Singapore needed more such active residents.<br><br>For even though $10 million has been spent on prevention measures, the number of dengue cases is still not letting up.<br><br>Dr Yaacob said: "Singaporeans cannot take this lightly because once the number of dengue cases go up, the possibility of dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) increases and that's the one that we worry about.<br><br>"So we have to remove dengue fever entirely so that we do not have DHF. So Singaporeans must understand that negligence on their part can add to public health problem which can be very, very disastrous for some Singaporeans.<br><br>"It has led to death in some Singaporeans, so we have to send a message that you have a role to play."<br><br>Home owners are still the biggest culprits, with 55 per cent of mosquito breeding grounds found in homes.<br><br>Flower pots, if left unchecked, can be a breeding ground for mosquitoes.<br><br>So the message again is for home owners to check for breeding grounds, as a puddle even the size of a 10-cent coin, can mean trouble.<br><br>Another 45 per cent of breeding grounds are outdoors - with clogged drains, pump rooms and roof tops posing big problems.<br><br>So Town Councils which look after common areas are urged to adopt the recommended vector control guidelines.<br><br>Similar guidelines for construction sites had proved successful when implemented in 1999.<br><br>Under the Environment Control Scheme, construction sites are required to engage officers trained by the NEA who draw up plans and monitoring schemes to keep the site free from mosquitoes.<br><br>Now only 9 per cent of mosquito breeding are found in construction sites - down from 30 per cent before.<br><br>The NEA said for the first half of this year, the number of dengue cases had already reached 6,022 - more than double for the same period last year (2,700).<br><br>The number of fines issued have also gone up, from 68 in February to 245 in June.<br><br>The upsurge in the number of dengue cases is, however, not peculiar to Singapore, with other countries in the region, facing a similar problem.<br><br>Thailand has seen 10,000 cases of the more dangerous dengue haemorrhagic fever while in Vietnam, more than 7,000 cases were reported.<br><br>Global warming has also been blamed for the rise in the number of dengue cases in the region.<br><br>The female Aedes mosquitoes are known to thrive more in warmer weather - maturing faster and hastening their reproduction ability. - CNA/de<br><br><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/159495/1/.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/159495/1/.html</a><br><br>They have already spent with no esults.
