It's the attraction part that counts. If there's no chemistry, there's no beginning. Got that?</span><br><br><strong><blockquote>While it is true that if you fulfill those qualities you will probably make a good husband, they still won't pick you! It's like believing that those Miss Universe pageants actually want world peace!</blockquote></strong><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Well, I don't know about the rest of the guys, but I surely know you are one of the exception. Being a good husband doesn't really have to fulfill those stupid long-winded criterias. It's more on how you communicate chemistry and sexual tension to a women you love. Women are attracted to guys who knows how to turn their knobs, not guys who simply follow criterias to please those women! You got that?</span><br><br><strong><blockquote>They won't admit what they really want. They will always take the moral high ground.</blockquote></strong><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Sure they do! They wouldn't admit to you and you are too lazy to go find out yourself. Why don't go all out and practice? Practice makes perfect.</span><br><br>S.H.I.N.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hee I never used to have a set of prescribed criteria...<br>I mean... important thing is both enjoy the company of each other ba. Cos as long as you enjoy each other physically, emotionally and mentally... well somethings going on well!<br><br>Having met my husband.. I think the 'criteria' he has that really did work for us<br><br>1. He's old fashioned! and has old fashioned values and truly believe in marriage and love and family.<br><br>2. He's expressive and not afraid to show what he feels.<br><br>3. He's a gardener! (by hobby not career) and I think anyone who love plants truly understand what is unconditional love. He is willing to forgive and give.<br><br>4. He is unpretentious and down to earth<br><br>5. He is able to laugh at himself and have a sense of humour towards life.<br><br>I think eventually when it comes to settling down, really it becomes the values that are at stake. Does he have the same values as you? Even if you meet a person who is willing to commit, spend time, giving, IF he doesnt have the same outlook towards life and priority in values, then I  guess... it will be difficult to have a long term commitment.</div>
