I stood up to offer my seat to the old man coz he looks considerably older than the old lady. Then that kiam-pah-face guy juz "vroom" and shifted to my seat ONCE i stood up!!! D.A.M.N it!!! Then he PRETENDED to be sleeping after that!! WHAT THE?? I think he got a bit paiseh when i diao him a bit, then he looked at the empty seat, supposedly signalling the old man 2 sit there. the old man then offered the seat 2 the old lady. He didn't sit down until some1 else alighted. I was so pissed off by that insensitive guy lar!!
