When he looked up at me, I said, "did I say I was giving up my seat for you?"<br><br>Guess what he said? "Who ask you to leave your seat?"<br><br>I said something like," you saw me giving the seat to the auntie right?"<br><br>And he said," Ya, but you left your seat right?"<br><br>I was soooooo pissed and my legs were breaking from my high heels for the rest of my journey back home...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </div></blockquote>this guy is a disgrace to his ancestors.<br><br></div>
