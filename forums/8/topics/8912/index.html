            <div class='col-md body'>This morning i was on my way to school on a fully packed train, when i felt someone caress my buttocks.<br>I thought it was an accident but it kept happening a few times.<br>I got fed up and turned around stared at the guy standing behind me. He gave me dat innocent look like as though nothing happened. During the next stop, alot of ppl boarded the train, making it even more packed. I was terribly sandwiched in the middle of the train. Then this time i felt something somebody's crotch pressing against my buttocks. I wanted to turn around and slap that bugger, but the train had already reached my stop. So i just quickly walked off. Should i have pursued the matter or was it just my luck?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm really sorry to hear such a thing.. but still it's just ur luck this time round.. coz I think there is nothing u can do... make a report but still little can be done about it. The police can arrest him, but he may be able to deny everything. Furthermore it's a one to one basis. Unless someone else to be the witness or become his victim. The both of u have a better say.<br><br>If u remember the SCGS incident dunno how many yrs ago, the students come together and caught the molester... I think there must be someone else before u can be sure of nailing him. At least if there's a witness or something.

You don't even have a proper breathing space to breathe..... So The Best way is to react accordingly to the situation!!!<br>Well If I were you I would put some sharp objects into my bag and just hang it on my back.. No matter how crowded it is NO Mother SON would have the guts to approach!!!<br><br>recently We have heard about the AMK Rapist!! Well the govt gave him 22yrs jail and 24strokes of caning!!! My personnel opinion :<strong>Cut his PENIS away..</strong> He wouldnot attempt any sort of rape activities in his Life ever after!!!!<br><br>------------------<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Shirley,<br><br>If u wanna pursue that matter, you should have done it on the spot, like shouting for help or something like that. Now that its over, don't think there's anything that you can do, as there's no proof now and where in the world are you gonna find that guy? Unless u know where to look for him.<br><br>Just try to be more careful the next time round. This may be the 1st time , and that's why you aren't expereince in handling such situation. If there's a next time (hopefully not), make sure that u ask for help or shouted for help. I am sure some kind souls ard will help you, so that these 'bastards' won't get away for nothing.<br><br>Regard</div>
