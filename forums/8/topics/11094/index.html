            <div class='col-md body'>Love have to be proven and said. Different individuals have different definations of what is the meaning of love. Take for example, your bf buys u a diamond necklace and ur frens know about it, they will say "wahhh ur bf loves u so much , how I wish my bf give me a DIAMOND  bracelet too!"<br><br>So does material goods represent love? I would choose not. A rich person should spend time and effort to make his love feels valuable cos he has all the money to buy anything for the gal. However, an average-income man buying the same diamond necklace means something. He could have bought nicer clothes for himself or buy some latest electronic goods to pamper himself but he did not. He chose to give something 'valuable' to his partner cos he knows that she will love it and he loves her to see her happy. This is the gift of love. ----Giving what u have but not what u can.<br><br>So love has very different interpretations nowadays. To me if a person were to say he love me, he will have to manifest it in his own personal me...PLEASE DO NOT HESITIATE TO SURPRISE ME! Frankly, I love lotsa material stuffs but I hardly owe any of them. Not because I cannot afford it, it is because they are not suitable for me now as there are better things in live I should get for with the mediocre assets I have.<br><br>How can one say "I love u" When he keep hurting and not salvaging? Who is the wise one who said, " To hit pamper, and to scold is to love?" It does not mean this way all the time. The notion of love? it is just a passing phase like clouds that changes it shape all the time...It depends on the weather....<br><br>Chicago---'Just say u love me for the rest of your life'  did anyone say this to u yet?)<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 02 February 2001).]</div>

If you<br>think  something will make you happy, go for it. Remember that we pass this way only  once.<br>Bottomline :<br>Time don't wait. If you think you might have found the  right one, treasure him/her. Don't let he/she go away. Don't let fear hold you  back.<br>Give it a try else you might regret later...
