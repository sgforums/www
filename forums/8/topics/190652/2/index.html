            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gwangetto:</div><div class="quote_body">okay. just some of my thoughts.<br><br>i think there's a God. because firstly, we do not exist just like that. the animals do not exist just like that.. so did the vegetations and the entire universe. it was actually created and conceived within a mind of something which birth forth such beautiful creation.<br><br>in order to understand God as Creator, we need to understand that only He has self-existence, whereas we are all created beings. And He gave us all the ability to reproduce. When we understand that we are creatures, created by the Creator, we then understand that we are ultimately accountable to that Creator. (The main reason some people claim to be atheists is that to admit their accountability to Someone greater than themselves.)<br><br>Understanding and acknowledging that we are creatures ultimately responsible to a Creator is what enables us to truly understand what it means to be able to reproduce only after our own kind - in other words, we can reproduce only what we are.<br><br>To understand and appreciate God as Creator properly, we must also understand that as a loving Creator, God's nature is to provide for His creation. Grasping this truth establishes a relationship between Creator and creature based on accountability, love and complete trust.<br><br>So in conclusion, there is a dimension out there that we need to acknowledge. For we are absolutely not alone. God is with us all along.<br><br>Even the bible says in Psalms 14:1<br><br>"The fool has said in his heart, 'There is no God.'..."<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </div></blockquote>Ok. Firstly, since you and the bible claim that all living creatures, or should I say everything in this universe, are the creation of something or someone call 'God'. Talking about creation, I was pondering how your so-called 'God' creates us? Moulding? Thinking? Abracadabra? Having learned science, I wondered if your 'God' slowly pieced all things in the universe using atoms and elements. And I wondered how 'God' did it. As your so-called "divine and holy" bible just solely claims that we are creation, I am more interested in the process of creation.<br><br>'God' is self-existance? How could I understand this absurb theory, or basically simple-minded thinking, just because christians and the 'always truthful' bible say so? You people always failed prove the statement. Since your 'God' has the ability, I do not know how, to be existing since don't know when, why can't we human beings?<br><br>Let me tell you something, no one knows the earliest history of human, yes, not even your 'God'. It is just the early christians trying to claim some credits for their person of worship for the roots of human. Think I'm just bullshi<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>t with no proof, likewise for your bible.<br><br>"The fool has said in his heart, 'There is no God.'..." --&gt; Bible<br><br>"The fool has said in his heart, 'There is God.' ..." --&gt; Book of Wisdom by Skyfoo</div>
