Companies are commercial entities, not charitable organisations.  Even the staff who called you needs to be paid.....and guess where they're getting the money from?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Anyway, you made the right choice by not going.<br><br></div>
