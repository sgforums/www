I believe a major part of education is to bring out the full potential of a mind, be it great or not is not the issue.

All the Chinese classmates I know say the government tries to keep the best students in the country for their Beijing University and such. Maybe there's some exceptions here and there.<br><br>I took TOEFL before. It's not a demanding test. Neither is IELTS from what I heard of it. The Chinese students in my school have to take the IELTS before they go to Australia and many of them signed up for courses helping them pass.<br><br>This is how the course is structured:<br><br>They give you the answers, no questions (You can't predict which questions you'll be asked to answer, but they figure you can memorize all the answers to the questions asked in the past so you memorize them all)<br>During the exam, you vomit the answers.<br>If you fail the exam, you can retake the course for free until you manage to regurgitate the correct answers and pass.<br><br>To me, that's like telling someone who has never seen any plant life and telling him/her to remember "Apple, Orange, Durian, Tree"<br><br>What if the question is, "What is not a fruit?"<br><br>A) Apple<br>B) Orange<br>C) Tree<br>D) Durian<br><br>From my experience, the PRC citizens can really do a good job knowing the whole text inside out but when it comes to hands on or practical it's not as smooth flowing. There are exceptions though, but in my situation it is not as common.<br><br>I do agree with your points 1-4 though.</div>
