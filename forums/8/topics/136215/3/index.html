            <div class='col-md body'>Silvergal, dun get too agitated.<br><br>I guess the sweeping generalisation tends to piss everyone off, guys and gals alike.<br><br>There will always be those black sheep amongst guys and gals. The blacksheep amongst the guys are those that malinger until they get PES C or whine about serving NS.<br><br>There are also those gals that brush guys off calling guys "losers" for doing NS, dun ask me how does doing NS equate to loser. The point is that, in every system, there will always be those that take and take and contributing nothing in return.<br><br>Shopping and SPGism is not considered as boosting the economy and tourism of sg, thereby not considered as economic and social defence.<br><br>Of course there are those gals that respect the NS institution and those in it. SilverGal, if you are one of those that respect the NS institution and the guys serving, then dun get offended by the constant "whining" as you are not the subject. If you feel that you fall into the category, then perhaps you might want to give valid reasons why all guys that undergo NS deserve to be snubbed.<br><br>How can one show appreciation for guys that do NS? Firstly, stop whining about how unfair it is for the public sector to give a higher starting pay to guys that did NS citing that NS is not relevant experience.<br><br>Try not to snub at guys that are doing their NS. Just because they are doing NS doesn't make them any less human (I once heard a gal tell her friends, "This place is full of NS guys, no wonder the place stinks").<br><br>Stop rubbing the fact that you start uni and work earlier. Most guys are career minded and won't appreciate the hadicap of 2.5 years. No, you can't joke about it either. (again from experience," while you were wasting your time playing toy soldiers, I was working and building my career")<br><br>Perhaps, this would be a first step in stifling the incessent whining.<br><br>I was in a combat vocation and am still very proud of my achievements. Granted, I did not go as high as I had wanted to in NS, but I know that I would still have chosen my vocation for NS again if the chance presented itself.</div>

Perhaps the attitudes the youngs ladies have these days (if the snubbing is as prevalent as some here claim) towards their Singapore men serving NS and reservist stem from the men themselves?<br><br>It would be pretty difficult for girls to respect NS men and have the merest of ideas the difficulties they have to go through if, for instance,  they read what some of the young men complain about here - how little respect they have for the regulars, how these men 'cannot make it in the real world', how their superiors play golf all day, do nothing but get served coffee in their comfortable air-conditioned rooms and how much of a waste of time NS is since no one learns anything and recruits get picked on for no rhyme, reason or purpose.<br><br>I was never introduced to NS this way and the majority of my friends have served and still serve with pride, like yourself. Their attitudes alone have made me proud of our men in green and I have always thought that every extra the government gives to our men for National Service is more than justified.<br><br>But the things I read here ...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
