The Moonlite Bunny Ranch is offering free sex to troops returning from the U.S.-Iraq war, and plans to offer 50 percent discounts on sex to the military for the next few weeks. The first 50 servicemen and women will receive a knockoff of their military-issued personal-hygiene kits, containing condoms, lubricant, an adult magazine and a certificate for free sex. Thirteen men and three women in uniform have shown up so far to claim their gifts. The brothel's patriotic offer will cost it about $50,000. Takes flag waving to a whole new level."</strong></blockquote>Soldiers of duty, honor and country are important, and it's just as important for them to feel like the community they are from stands behind them<br><br></div>
