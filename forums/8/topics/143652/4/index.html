I never bother whether I get to see my father at all.... cos wat its importantn I have money for next meal... I was fighting for my survival at your age<br><br>I beleive now  YOU get to see your dad everyday rite???? your wish come true what... and you must be bloody happy ... why bother to write such stupid letter to the PM.... Isnt this a happy ending for Princess Durai??? time for a celebration with all the peanuts your father have ... you guys can migrate to Australia  and live a luxurious life loh.. while all the patient and donors suffer here<br><br>The conscience you have is as good as your father !!<br><br>Hope you get kidney failure soon so you get to exp the patient agony and fustration</div></blockquote>Wow...  This is abit too strong and I feel is overboard.  Everyone loves their dad and it is only proper that she stand out to try clear her father name.  However, what you had written does drawn lots of similarity with myself.  When I was young, I got to see my father only once a week and that is on a Thursday night which is his off day.  ( Half day only ).  Sometime, he need to help friend out, I don't even got to see him on that week.  When I was in Primary six, I found a part time job and work till my hand hurt.  That did not stop me as I hope my father would be able to spend a little more time at home.  Ms Durai is lucky indeed.  Perhaps it would be better if she would have kept to herself and now start enjoying the companion of her father.</div>
