            <div class='col-md body'>What's uglier in all this, is the politician(s)' decision to make public TT.Durai's daughter's letter. It's too ugly. Very. Trying to garner some sympathy by exposing the personal family matter of TT.Durai, moving him closer to the public and more sympathetic, using her daughter and her plight.<br><br>Please. Stop it. No.<br><br>I recall the 'advice' for Straits Time not to put a 'spin' and get cocky. Perhaps this advice of not putting spins should be applied to urself first.<br><br>Especially when it involves manipulating an unwilling and innocent 18-year-old daughter who wrote on her personal family plight about her dad.<br><br>Many people have condemned the daughter too now. She's now a 'victim' of ur political move, a pawn. Wow. This is great, huh? Could u get any uglier?<br><br>Guys, please stop condemning the daughter. What she did was natural, in fact I would be proud if I have a daughter like that. What is 'un-natural' and totally ugly, is the politician for 'using' this letter. Can't u guys see what's happening?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There is a saying Â“a leader should not demand respect, but earn respect through their deedsÂ”.  And if we talk about reputation, isnÂ’t this a perception that one derived from observation of the subject personÂ’s actions and behaviour?  So, instead of seeking someone from high office to cleanse the Â“sinÂ”, I thought the rational approach is for her to advise her father to continue with the fight in court so that he could vindicate himself from any wrongdoing and this would certainly be the most effectively way to restore his reputation.<br><br>So, I am just curious what is it that Ms Durai wants from PM to restore his fatherÂ’s reputation.<br><br>What could PM do?<br><br>**  Reinstate TT Durai as CEO of NKF?<br><br>**  Make a ministerial statement that investigation showed no wrongdoing, and the parliament hereby restore the reputation of TT Durai.
