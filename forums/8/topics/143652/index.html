            <div class='col-md body'>TT Durai's daughter appeals to PM Lee to help restore her father's honour<br><br>SINGAPORE : The daughter of TT Durai, the former CEO of the National Kidney Foundation, has appealed to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to help restore her father's honour and reputation if a review of the NKF shows there have not been any wrongdoings.<br><br>Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan disclosed this in Parliament on Thursday.<br><br>Mr Khaw, who was responding to points made by MPs over the two days of debate, had urged the House to also look at the issue from the perspective of Mr Durai's family.<br><br>He said Mr Durai's daughter, a junior college student who is mature for her age, had emailed the Prime Minister.<br><br>Saying she was adversely affected by the fiasco, she wrote: "Since I was young, my father had very little time to spend with usÂ…I always asked myself why my father had no time for us. Were we less important to him than his patients? Was his work more important than us?"<br><br>And she went on to ask Mr Lee, "After the review by the new board, you will help him to restore his reputation and honour, if no wrong doings were found?"<br><br>Mr Khaw said Mr Durai's achievements for the NKF were real and significant.<br><br>But ego and arrogance could have gone to his head, leading to poor judgement and insensitivity.<br><br>Mr Khaw cautioned, "I think there are lessons for us here. No matter how great our achievements are, we live for others. Look at the late Mr Hon Sui Sen. There was no ego in the man. He completely personified humility.<br><br>"Likewise the late President Wee Kim Wee and hence the huge outpouring of emotions at his funeral. President S.R. Nathan is another such humble man who has done great for society, but remains his past self."<br><br>Mr Khaw also had a word of caution for other players in the NKF saga.<br><br>He said, "I scanned through the local media today. I could not help noticing the different spin The Straits Times put to the MPs' speeches yesterday, compared to all the other local media, like TODAY and ZaoBao. Let us hope arrogance has not also gone to the head of the victor in the Court case." - CNA/de<br><br><strong>The question is does he deserve it...BIG EGO and lack of HUMANITY!!!</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Contrary to the daughter of TT Durai, there does not appear to be any need for 'correction'.<br><br>All that has happened is that he is exposed as the cunning and devious fox without a shred of humility nor grace. His actions and failure to correct major errors in press statements since 1992 stink of deliberate deception and manipulation of the public on a scale not seen since the indonesian confrontation.<br><br>That he is a proven mercenery is beyond doubt.<br><br>All his attempts at manoeuvring and evasion during his cross examination was 'nuked back to the stone age' as Davindar Singh pretty much proved his case of discrediting TT Durai's lack of integrity.<br><br>In response to his daughter's request: Open your eyes and look around you, your household, your clothes, the food on your table, the restaurants you have visited, the car you sit in, the maid in your house, your home entertaiment system etc etc. Where do you think the purchasing power came from?

            <div class='col-md body'>Ms Durai..<br><br>You are probably driven to school in a car that is largely sponsored by public funds..<br><br>The clothes you wear.. the luxuries you enjoy.. are from the pockets of people who may not have the opportunity to enter a junior college let alone complete the 'A' levels and stand a chance to attain a degree in a university.<br><br>Your father has indeed spearheaded an organization that has raised millions of dollars for the needy and has definitely made lives easier for many patients.<br><br>But i have to say it and you're not going to like it.<br><br>The NKF saga has exposed many issues at the top management level. These issues in the eyes of the law are not ILLEGAL and therefore not WRONG. Morally, they are debatable. But let me ask you if what your father did was RIGHT? Ask him whether it was right for him to consider the gold plated tap, ask him whether the business dealings NKF did with companies where he was director of were clean, ask him whether he feels comfortable about NKF funds paying road tax for his personal vehicle when he still takes the company car to work instead, mom drives it? What about giving INCORRECT information (yes it's different from false reporting) about the figures related to the number of patents that NKF has?<br><br>Let's put his working ways aside. What about the arrogance when he made the move to take SPH to court? What about the nerve to take those two men to court over allegations that prove to be true a few years later? What about the lack of humility when he responded to questions fielded by reporters over his resignation? What about the lack of a public apology?<br><br>Your father may have contributed much to society. But what he has done or not done, discredits all the achievements he has accomplished. Your father's undoing was not a result of malicious scheming but a simple case of shooting himself in the leg.<br><br>In your eyes, he is definitely still a good man.. being a filial daughter, i praise you for taking steps to defend your father. But I think you made the appeal to the wrong person. First of all.. you should be writing a letter to your father.. ask him what really went wrong.. and ask him where he can go on from his mistakes. Next.. take to the streets.. apologise to the man in the street that works hard just to donate money to an organization that can afford to give out 12 month bonuses when his own bonus isn't assured of.<br><br>If you want your father's honour to be restored.. Don't get the PM to do it for you.. he's got more problems to handle.. ask daddy to do it himself. After all.. he does seem to have more time on his hands now.</div>
