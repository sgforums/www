            <div class='col-md body'>John has a rich dad. His dad bought his car, his condominium and had set aside money for his future wedding. His dad also paid for his Australian education. If you liked John you could marry him straight away. His dad will pay for it, even the condomium's renovation and the 15 tables banquet your parents request. Under John's name, there's a condomium, a car, close to 6 figure in his bank account, saved by his dad for him. John is 25, just started to work and earns $2000 a month as a junior executive.<br><br>Peter's family is average. His parents financed him through a local university. Now he has graduated, 25, just joined a firm and also drawing $2000. He saves half of what he makes so that he may have enough for future stuffs like marriage or investments. Coming from an average family and at 25 he decided that all his possessions from now must be bought with his own money. He doesn't have much to his name now, 2 insurances, around a year worth of income in the bank and a little investments in shares. If you marry John, you both will have to save up for the banquet, the 5 room flat and future expense and that will take 3 years to save up by both of you collectively..<br><br>With the silver spoon in his mouth, John tends to be easier on money. He buys you nice dinner at resturants, gifts but obviously is not as pragmatic and down to earth as Peter.<br><br>Peter dines at foodcourt and do not spend unnecessary, so obviously you do not get as many gifts and dine in nice resturants with Peter. Peter works 12 to 14 hours a day because he wants to raise in ranks. Contrarily, John finish off work mostly on the dot and goes to meet his friends to watch soccer at the pub or head the gym. John is not lazy. His style of working is  just like anyone else off the streets. Peter would be what you would consider hardworking.<br><br>Now imagine that both Peter and John are nice people and both wants to marry you.<br><br>Would you go for the rich kid or the poor kid?</div>

You could party with him past midnight and still feel safe because he sends you right to the doorstep.<br><br>When you date Peter.<br><br>- He talks about 5 room flats in Sengkang and the down payments needed to get one. He will probably shop in IKEA and tells you who are his buddies he will invite to paint the house together with.<br><br>- He tells you that he is saving up to visit Bali and Myanmmar and the furthest he has been to is Hong Kong.<br><br>- He eats with you at the foodcourt. He brings you to resturants occasionally. But you have caught him munching bread at work the following week so now you nod in agreement whenever he suggests fish soup at the food court.<br><br>- He sees you home in an MRT and usually does so before midnight so he does not miss the last train himself. He lives at the other corner of the island so your dates with him must end by 11. Or else he misses the last train, has to take a cab and will munch on bread again the following week.<br><br>Who will you choose?<br></div>
