            <div class='col-md body'>An important message for all Singaporeans:<br><br>Article taken from ChannelNewsAsia.com<br><br>========<br><br>Instead of allowing religious diversity to divide people, we should use religion to bring people of different faiths together, says the Minister of State for Community Development and Sports Yaacob Ibrahim.<br><br>Associate Professor Yaacob was speaking at the Inter-Religious Organisation Day celebrations on Sunday.<br><br>The celebrations saw many faiths coming together for one common prayer - for peace and harmony in Singapore and the world.<br><br>Recent events have raised the question of religion's role in nation-building.<br><br>Although fringe groups may seek to undermine harmony from time to time, Singapore leaders say the country's religious groups have worked well together.<br><br>"Religious harmony remains strong. Because the majority of people are very steadfast in their faith, are very steadfast in their respect for others, they're very steadfast in their sensitivity towards others. So that's the more important thing," said President S R Nathan.<br><br>For religion to remain a constructive force, Associate Professor Yaacob said all communities must work at promoting religious harmony.<br><br>Besides taking a moderate approach and respecting the sensitivities in each religious community, Singaporeans must continue to expand the common space.<br><br>And the Inter-Racial Confidence Circles (IRCCs) can only succeed if religious and community leaders get their members to actively participate in them.<br><br>"There is no one model for an IRCC for all of us to follow. When I was studying in the United States, my fellow Muslim students and I would have our Friday prayers at the basement of a church. We learn to accommodate each other's needs. We got along well under the supervision of the priest of the church," said Associate<br>Professor Yaacob.<br><br>Such shared use of religious grounds is just one way of promoting interaction and understanding.<br><br>For a start, there's now the latest Inter-Religious Organisation edition and its website was launched for better understanding of different religions in Singapore.<br><br>Source: <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/2685/1/.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/2685/1/.html</a><br><br>========<br><br>Do share your thoughts on these questions:<br><br>1. How relevant is A/P Yaacob's call for unity? In short, is such a call rooted in the realities of a multi-racial, multi-religious society, or simply a "feel-good" kind of message?<br><br>2. Is such tolerance a burden, or a benefit to all religions?<br><br>3. How does evangelical, or missionary activity tie in with the need to be "senstive" to other religions? In other words, is preaching an activity that offends other faiths' sensitivities?<br><br>[This message has been edited by yidd (edited 18 March 2002).]</div>

Not like such calls are still strangers to us, they highly focus on POLITICAL (external overseas relationship), ADDRESS to general public and PREVENTION of futher EXTREMIST ACTs using religion as the name. I feel that it's most certainly ROOTED. For the SAKE of it and DEFINITELY NOT just for the fun of it?<br><br><strong><br>2. Is such tolerance a burden, or a benefit to all religions?</strong><br><br>Depends... It can be BOTH a burden or a benefit to all religions... Though the weighage of burden and benefit may varies among the different religions... But it's DEFINITELY a BENEFIT for the country...<br><br><strong><br>3. How does evangelical, or missionary activity tie in with the need to be "senstive" to other religions?

It CAN be an offence to the other religion(s) or it can be not? Bottom line is to give adequate respect if you want ANY respect in return... And not to intervene with people's personal lifestyle or rights in the act of any preaching.<br></blockquote></div>
