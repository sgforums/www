            <div class='col-md body'>what is off-putting is to see fat people walking on the street and munching on their food at the same time as if they can't stop eating for a miniute...<br><br>some are fat due to their genes but they can overcome it by doing more exercise if they try hard enough. but the majority are just pure self-indulgent and lack of overall discipline, leading a wanton lifestyle and gorging all the food their hands can lay on, 24-7. These i despise and disapprove. i dont want my kids to think that being fat is acceptable or fashionable on the street. it is an eyesore.<br><br>Start young by not raising fat kids. That will be a good start. It is helping them during their lifetime. Dont feed them on McDonald and all those trash food. Nowadays, look around the malls and you will see so many fat kids. I hope they wont remain fat when they turn adult. it doesnt help in the building on their self image and esteem. who doesnt want a normal body?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>+1.<br><br>i have a friend who was in TAF Club frm Pri sch right up to Sec 4. in JC, he was in the same CCA wiv me, hockey. he worked hard, he lost weight. and the following year, he was my team captain. now, he's fit and is of PES A status for NS enlistment.<br><br>on the other hand, this guy ignorantly goes around saying he's fat and he's happy with it. this guy has a rather debatable side of him. so we thought whatever encouragement or advice we give him to get on exercising would just come to nought. he would just say.. "yes, i'm fat okay." and that's it. let's hope he survives the army.</div>
