            <div class='col-md body'>Depending where you are staying, getting around in Bangkok is really easy. The BTS and the MRT will bring you to most shopping and makan places. They are also quite cheap.<br><br>Most smaller eateries will also have English menu with the prices clearly stated. Obviously places like Patpong will charge you an arm and leg for a meal. You might want to give the World Central Plaza a miss (though it use to be quite upmarket) as it is undergoing major renovation. Siam Square/Siam Discovery Centre/ and the newly open Paragon is quite upmarket - alight at the Siam BTS station. Alternatively, walk, or change BTS to the next station - University and get to MBK or Mah Boon Krong. Good and cheap place, expect to pay 199 baht for a good quality t-shirt (at XXL even).<br><br>You can also get to Chatuchak weekend market (not sure which station - but both BTS and MRT goes there). Cheaper stuff here.<br><br>DVDs are not cheap so don't bother.<br><br>Can't talk about the sex or massage, not into these stuff.<br><br>If you can state where you're staying, I may be able to offer more tips.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, the weekend market is great. Cheap stuffs over there. Roadside stalls can eat  as long as the food you think they handled it clean and thoroughly cooked. I've eaten at roadside stalls when I was there last Dec and didn't have any problems though I'm having some illness inside me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok i can give u tips to bargain<br><br>1st rule, if u spot something nice, tell yourself how much u willing to pay(100 baht=$4)<br>ask the price<br>now the bargaining start.........usually i will start off with 1/4 of the original asking price and then slowly increase till i'm willing to pay that amount.<br>Note once bargaining and come to agree with the price.....never ever change your mind about buying it. unless you want to taste thailand boxing.<br><br>after agreeing to the price then u ask for the size if its is clothes you are buying. if cant find the size u want than its ok to back off. never ask for the size first before bargaining<br><br>next, if u see angmoh in the shop, avoid it cause the shopkeeper wont let u bargain<br><br>note i bought a pair of shoes for 500 baht that was originally asking for 1800 baht<br><br>happy shopping;p</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The last time i went there for holiday, i stayed at Bai Yoke Sky hotel which is situated in a midst of pratunam.<br><br>In front of the hotel, they have all this makeshift stalls that sell damn cheap stuffs. Remember to bargain. Expect to pay 100baht or less if you're getting T shirts or stuffs. Watches there will cost not more than 200bht.<br><br>Be wary when a tuk tuk driver said they can send you to your intended area for less than 50bht. They will send you to this jewellery area ( selling Diamonds and gem ) first all cos they wanna get the free diesel coupon. Some could be very persistant.<br><br>If you need to take the taxi, ask the driver to on the meter as they will jack up the price 4 to 5 times the actual fare on meter. You can take the MTR which is convinient and ask the hotel staffs for directions if you need to.<br><br>In Chatuchak, always bargain more than 50% of the selling price. You'll be surprise they will actually lower the price when you showed them intentions of walking away.<br><br>Last but not least, enjoy your trip and take care.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

Do check it out. I believe some Airlines with detour flights have cheaper tickets to Bangkok. It's hard to really recommend any stalls in particular.</div>

It's better to have your selection on hand and bargain with it. Usually when you have big purchases, bargaining it easy. Like someone have said, you can get shirts at a low 50 baht with pretty good quality.  When bargaining, always remember that you start with the lowest. The people won't give further discount even if you decide to buy more but after bargaining already.</div>
