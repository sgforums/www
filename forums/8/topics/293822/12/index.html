Thanks! So please go on hoping.<br><br>2) Smoking is a disrespect to the arm forces? This is a new one I hearing from a civilain. Most of NSmen or NSF would be smoking with no.4 on because smoking naked is not really very sexy.<br><br>3) Yes, you are correct to say that it is not put to the test. Even the East Timor thing SAF forces were put way behind frontlines. You will have to understand the diplomatic ties Sg is having with its neighbours and signing of varies diplomatic treaties. Remember i told u abt lots of US navy guys? It is one of the treaties. Emmm... I can't think of a good reason why anyone would wanna invade Sg. We have nothing but foregin talents. And even if there were to be a major invasion, sg will only be a staging area for something bigger.<br><br>4) Its really oki to date angmo. Cause they human too.

Therefore cutting NS time is only possible if the SAF can find a way to train the soldiers in a shorter time and the operational and combat capability of the SAF can be maintained at the same time.</div>

So please go on hoping.<br><br>2) Smoking is a disrespect to the arm forces? This is a new one I hearing from a civilain. Most of NSmen or NSF would be smoking with no.4 on because smoking naked is not really very sexy.<br><br>3) Yes, you are correct to say that it is not put to the test. Even the East Timor thing SAF forces were put way behind frontlines. You will have to understand the diplomatic ties Sg is having with its neighbours and signing of varies diplomatic treaties. Remember i told u abt lots of US navy guys? It is one of the treaties. Emmm... I can't think of a good reason why anyone would wanna invade Sg. We have nothing but foregin talents. And even if there were to be a major invasion, sg will only be a staging area for something bigger.<br><br>4) Its really oki to date angmo. Cause they human too. So far I had been working with angmo for 5 yrs plus and find that they're really nice. I think alot of angmo will like you angel7030.</div></blockquote>Now your honor, Look at these SGmen, sometime they get jealous we go for ang mo, then now they said it is ok to go with ang mo, weird isn't it.<br><br>SAF are only good as peace keeper and male nurses. And if SGmen do not think of any reason why others will invade Singapore, I simply do not understand why they go serve NS for 2.5 years for what??? Oh, MY GOD, you honor, I really pity them for being so naive and yet go thru the motion of SAF training with any objectives.</div>

Whether its ang-mo or bo-mo, you will be the one living ur own life. It really doesn't matter wat other pple thinks. If it does matter, prehaps u r in love with yourself more and not ang-mo.<br><br>2) Of cos you do not understand angel, if you do, you will not ask such question. SAF is just a must to show/ warn off other countries we are capable of defensing ourselves. And because sg is so small and have a limited population, of cos all fit males will be drafted into the army. SAF will always wanna defense aganist "up north" and really, we don't have anything for any potential enemies unless someone wanna use sg as "staging area for something bigger".<br><br>3) By the way, if u don't like sg men, why don't u try getting a citizenship somewhere else? I assume u r sg born and breed right? u can just surrender ur citizenship, get all ur cpf money and migrate overseas to NZ or OZ.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>its because they have more money then sg guys , the so-called ang-mo-lang that we often hear in singapore are americans. so thats the reason sg girls like ang-mo-lang cos they like to be unique, to be called like ang-mo-liu-lian something like that lah.they dun want to be called , example:peter's wife, john's wife,they want something special and unique when people call them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>All this talk of Singapore being invaded i think is full of crap. Seriously, no where in the near future or even in 40-100 years can i see Singapore being invaded by our neighbors.<br><br>Lets have a look at our neighboring countries:<br><br>Malaysia: Come on... You really think its ever going to happen? For hell, our old politicians say we rely on our friends to the north. Not gonna happen.<br><br>Indonesia: Part of ASEAN, if this ever happens, the shits gonna hit the ceiling and  really im quite sure Indonesia realizes theres no chance with a US navy base here, plus also the fact that the Malaysian will side with us, after all, one of the retreat tactics is to retreat into Malaysia if ever Indonesia hits us.<br><br>Thailand: Much too far away for them to do anything to us. Yes they have one air craft carrier, but our air force could take them on easily. A land invasion will be too much trouble, and all for what?<br><br>Laos, Cambodia, Burma/Myanmar, Vietnam: I really don't think they have anything against us or ever will.<br><br>So, as we can see, there is a need for an army, yes, but for NS? Not too sure. Our defence force is really surrounded and aimed towards our commandos and our air force. I often read of our support battalions being sent off to New Zealand and India to fight in the rolling hills and deserts of those countries. Wait a moment, when did Singapore EVER have those types of terrains? Oh yeah maybe 200 years ago... but not now. The way the army is training our soldiers i feel is going in the wrong direction, and for the wrong reasons, i personally feel this is caused by the old politicians still in parliament. Not that they did a bad job making singapore what it is now, but its time for a change.<br><br>This 2 years is really ridiculous, whoever said we need that time to train NS guys must be stupid. The swiss and the dutch do it for 6 months, thats all they need. Put us in the companies and battalions and whatever, yes incase of the ever need to do whatever. That would take a year, whats the extra year for? My brother and my cousins both went in, it became an extra year of crap, total waste of time in the governments money and their time. Its a hell of a pity considering a lot can be done in one year.</div>

All rise!! for the judge arrival.<br><br>Bonk bonk!!! speak the truth, nothing but the truth. Amen.<br><br>Defence please!<br><br>Your honor, this one-niner is really running out of forty-niner burgers, how can today SAF helmet follow the WWII German one? Today helmet are made of light weigh material (plastic) and not some cast iron metal steel of the old WWII type. And it is the instruction of the American to ask Israel to first train the Singapore weak men to be soldier by providing arms and equipment, because in geopolitical speaking, Singapore condition do resemble Israel where it is surrounded by Muslim countries.<br><br>Even the Air forces and navies bought their aircrafts and ships from the American, or at least consulted the American if SAF budget is too low for modern crafts. You have F16, F15, M16, GBMG, etc etc are from the US. Most of the Rangers, pilot and even commando are trained in US too, if I am not wrong?<br><br>Have u seen US submarine in Sembawang Naval Base?? I am not saying SAF copied the US, I am saying SAF is adopting the US style, their hierrachy system, reporting system, training system and even communication system.<br><br></div></blockquote>I do recalled using the word Design and not materials used. Of course manufacturing process will improve with times.<br><br>I hope you take back the word weak singaporean men back. The very fact that an ordinary singapore is being called on to don a military uniform, bear arms and be ready always is not weak in my opinion. Did your dad do NS ?<br><br>The GBMG is called the General Purpose Machine Gun, and it was purchased from the Belgians initially.<br><br>When you mentioned adopted system, are you referring to technology or how the SAF will conduct a military operation ?<br><br>Lastly, we don't just train with the US troops for starters, there are other armed forces out there whom we , the SAF would train with and learn from.<br><br>Mods, do kindly lock this thread if OPSEC pertaining to US Naval presence is deemed as too sensitive to be discussed here.</div>
