Small heart, narrow mind and also small parts.<br><br>Ang mo are more gentle, jovious, big, long lasting, manly, romantic, caring and openness. However their weak point is they like to separate, but hell, if one cannot be together, it better to go separate way, to them is ok, to a SG guy is like the a major tragedy and shame to separate or divorce.<br><br>However even caucasian men also have different categories, for me i prefer the French and italian, so handsome with deep set blue eyes, it really take my breath away. </div></blockquote>SPG pig  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
