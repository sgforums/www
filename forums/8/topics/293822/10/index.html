Basically you are comparing apples with oranges.<br><br>I had the opportunity of studing in Australia, and couple of my house mates were drawing comparisions between the size and build of our army against their Anzacs.<br><br>They were commenting abt our size, whether could we lug the loads,push the limits etc etc...I asked them 1 question, "If John Howard told you to don an army uniform and serve the nation for 2.5 yrs, else your citizenship and rights will be removed from you. Will you serve ? " 101 % of them cursed and sweared at such a statement, calling him a slave driver, dictator. Most of them ( thank god) saw the point and realised we are a different army, we are citizen army, when the nation ordered us to bear arms and protect our country, we did (despite much resistance and grumbling).<br><br>If i had my way, i fxxking make sure you salute our boys in uniform for they sweated in peace time, so that no blood,if not less blood will be spilled.<br><br></div>

Basically you are comparing apples with oranges.<br><br>I had the opportunity of studing in Australia, and couple of my house mates were drawing comparisions between the size and build of our army against their Anzacs.<br><br>They were commenting abt our size, whether could we lug the loads,push the limits etc etc...I asked them 1 question, "If John Howard told you to don an army uniform and serve the nation for 2.5 yrs, else your citizenship and rights will be removed from you. Will you serve ? " 101 % of them cursed and sweared at such a statement, calling him a slave driver, dictator.
