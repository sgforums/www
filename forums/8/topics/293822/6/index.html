Some of the reasons they give are- can communicate better, more outgoing than locals, less introverted.<br><br>One other thing I've noticed though is a lack of understanding and appreciation of why asian guys are like that.<br><br>It's cuz:<br><br>1. Pressure from parents to get into medicine- so all free time goes to tutoring, learning piano and violin (borrrrring). No time for music, playing weekend sports etc.<br><br>2. National service. Further regimentation of the male mind for 2 years, which females can happily avoid. Wear the same clothes every day. Woohoo.<br><br>In the meantime, girls can happily go from school to uni/work knowing they are free from this and meet "outgoing" clubbing guys- read westerners.<br><br>I know this is a bit long. But Asian guys arent boring dull saps by choice. 21 years of enforced study and soldiering can  "dullify" a person.<br><br>Next time you go out with your western bf, say thank you to the SG guys, just for shouldering the burden of parental expectations and military obligations.<br><br>Yeah, I'm a bit angry. Three babes last weekend gave me the cold shoulder for white dudes.</div></blockquote>You are in the wrong market at the wrong time. Work on your character and social circle and stop giving myopic reasons like NS, music, etc...<br><br>You can't force people to like you if you do not have good quality to look out for.<br><br>Improve your skills, knowledge, poise, character, physique, education and be a good, understanding, sincere all rounder, and you will see you growth over time.<br><br>Good luck.</div>

Let them know what it is like charging up the bloody hill and dig trenches until their eyes pop out.<br><br>Looking at the attitude of these Singapore girls, I really think that if enemy troops come to take over Singapore, they can go serve as comfort women for the enemy troops, like what Japan did during World War 2. Then perhaps they will appreciate men more and that we are sacrificing our precious youth and time and shedding our sweat and tears for their protection and for their sake.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>You might think I am being very evil and harsh in my post here, but its just that I am too pissed off at the Singapore girls lousy attitude towards men, that they do not appreciate what we have done for them and that we sacrifice so much for them and they still keep this kind of attitude. If they carry on with this kind of attitude, I am not even going to think about protecting them during a war, they can go and suffer under the enemy for all I care!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't have the statistics with me right now, but I do recall that there are more unmarried Singapore women than there are Singapore men. This seems to me a key deviance from the idea than Singapore men are less attractive than Singapore women.<br><br>As for whether Singapore women do not appreciate Singapore men, I think it's a case of mutual under-appreciation. Both sides have rather unwelcome things to say about each other.<br><br>It escapes the notice of certain whiny members of both sexes that because of similar upbringing, they are really criticising themselves.<br><br>Singapore women who complain about the stereotypical failings of Singapore men seem to fail to see that ungraciousness is a trait of both the men and women here. For example,  to the women who say Singapore men don't groom themselves as much... that's true but hello, have you been to Hong Kong, Taiwan or Japan, the women are way better at make-up than most Singaporean women.<br><br>And Singapore men who complain that Singapore women are materialistic and cold could perhaps take a good look at themselves. And those who say Singaporean women have small breasts should check their own trousers.<br><br>Is the average angmoh here superior to the average Singapore male here? I'm going to be controversial and say yes. Most (not all) white dudes who come here are expats, who earn big bucks. I am going to assume most Singaporean expats are superior to the average Singaporean too. By superior I mean as date bait: wealth, world-view, sense of adventure, etc.<br><br>Also, remember the sporadic outbursts from women (sometimes in blogs, sometimes in the media) complaining about Vietnamese/Chinese women stealing their men?<br><br>It runs both ways.<br><br>It's quite a common thing for women to tsk in the presence of a China/Vietnam girl-Singapore man couple. There are many assumptions about the man and the woman in the air.<br><br>Often the assumptions are right.<br><br>But so what?<br><br>If indeed the average Vietnamese woman has more of what the average Singaporean man wants, and the average Singaporean man has more of what the average Vietnamese woman wants, it seems like a good thing to me. And the same for Caucasian-Singaporean pairings.<br><br>Like they say, it's a global market nowadays.</div>

Let them know what it is like charging up the bloody hill and dig trenches until their eyes pop out.<br><br>Looking at the attitude of these Singapore girls, I really think that if enemy troops come to take over Singapore, they can go serve as comfort women for the enemy troops, like what Japan did during World War 2. Then perhaps they will appreciate men more and that we are sacrificing our precious youth and time and shedding our sweat and tears for their protection and for their sake.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>You might think I am being very evil and harsh in my post here, but its just that I am too pissed off at the Singapore girls lousy attitude towards men, that they do not appreciate what we have done for them and that we sacrifice so much for them and they still keep this kind of attitude. If they carry on with this kind of attitude, I am not even going to think about protecting them during a war, they can go and suffer under the enemy for all I care!<br><br></div></blockquote>Ok . First of all, do you expect every single pretty young Singaporean woman to kiss your feet just because you served NS?<br><br>The fathers of those single pretty young Singaporean women also served NS. Are you saying those pretty young Singaporean women look down on their fathers as well?<br><br>And some Singaporean girls will have brothers and their fathers  fighting along side with you to protect your family as well in time of war. So quit having this attitude that you are the only one sacrificing yourself to "protect those ungrateful wretches" and therefore deserve to be dated by every single girl of your choice.<br><br>Occasionally guys get rejected everywhere regardless of their skin color , nationality etc but why do you guys  have to bring up your NS service? Shouldn't the SAF regulars then get the first pick from the crop by virtue of your argument?<br><br>You may be frustrated at the predicament but such is life. Which girls did you guys go for?<br><br>If you want a pretty girl who is incidentally being wooed by better looking guys or guys with a more well off background who may or may not served NS, expect to get a chance of rejection.<br><br>Before you sling mud on all the Singaporean girls , just think of this: are you going straight for the slimmest prettiest girl or the plain wallpaper flower?<br><br>You guys are talking about a relationship here , not some hero worship cult. You want someone who actually cares about you. So are you going to be so hung up over some pretty brood who rejects you or are you going to move on with your lives and find someone who can appreciate you for what you are and who you are?<br><br>Quit whining about it. Some guys who served NS are happily married now . Why did they get it lucky and you did not? Take a look at the mirror before you start shooting down every single girl who has no part in the matter.<br></div>
