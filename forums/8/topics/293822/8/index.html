            <div class='col-md body'>All we've heard is the threadstarter's side of the story.  We don't know if:<br><br>1) The three girls in question are Singaporeans<br>2) Said three girls are from university<br><br>What we <span style="text-decoration: underline;">do</span> know is that the TS is a whingy little piece of work who blames parents NS and anything he can get his hands on to blame for his failures.  All Singaporean males are subject to NS, and many, if not most, Singaporeans experience parental pressure.  Why does this guy fail when many other Singaporeans succeed?  Let's face it - if any one of us came across someone who loves whinng about everything under the sun instead of getting his act sorted out, would we want to associate with such a sad and sorry individual?<br><br>Let's take a reality check here, folks.  It's not about Singaporean girls or guys, it's not about whether anyone is from university or not  - it's just about this one loser.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay, perhaps you did not poke fun of and insult Singapore men and that is good, but do you realise that there are Singapore girls who do that? An example I give to you is some of the girls at my previous workplace, they poke fun of and insult men and blindly take sides with the women (in disputes involving men and women) just because they are women.<br><br>You tell me, should they be acting this way? They should be objectively assessing the situation and see who is right and wrong before passing and giving their verdict.<br><br>Even now when I have left the previous office one of my former female colleagues still sends me email poking fun of men.<br><br>Furthermore there are also girls who insulted some NS guys also, saying that they stink. Like I said in my previous post, do you know what it is like charging up the hill and digging trenches until your eyes want to pop out? They stink cos they have to stain their uniform with their sweat and tears to defend this precious land that they call home. I am definitely not saying and expecting girls to kiss my feet and worship me just because I served NS, but can you tell your fellow sisters especially those who insult and poke fun at Singapore men, not to do that? I dont think its very funny and I dont think you would like it very much if you were in our position.<br><br>The very least that Singapore girls can do is not to insult and poke fun of Singapore men, for goodness sake I am not even talking about appreciating us, is it too much to ask that of Singapore girls?<br><br>For example about two weeks ago the headlines on the front page of the New Paper blared out the headline quoting a woman's words that "Singapore men are stupid". Do you know how offended I felt about it? And do you not think that is insulting Singapore men? How would you feel if the tables were turned and the boot was on the other foot, ie the newspapers stated on their front page "Singapore girls are stupid"?<br><br>My father taught me to treat other people in a fair and just manner and therefore I believe in that philosophy. If you feel I have made any unfair comments and prove that it is unfair, I will be more than willing to admit my wrong and apologise. By the same token, you must be fair to us too. Singapore girls should not insult Singapore men and I think that is the least you all can do. I am not even expecting you all to appreciate us for heavens sake, and I definitely do not expect and even think that Singapore girls should kiss my feet and worship me just because I was in the army.<br><br>One last point I would like to state here is please do reply to my question in my previous post, and that is do you admit that there are good Singapore men out there too?<br><br>Please do feel free to reply and can I kindly request a courteous reply, because to tell you the truth, I have been controlling myself from losing my cool over this debate in the forum and I am controlling myself from getting angry even right now as I type this message, the main reason being that I think people have misunderstood me and think I want to brag and boast and think I am very great because I went through National Service.<br><br>That is not the case at all.

If you feel I have made any unfair comments and prove that it is unfair, I will be more than willing to admit my wrong and apologise. By the same token, you must be fair to us too. Singapore girls should not insult Singapore men and I think that is the least you all can do. I am not even expecting you all to appreciate us for heavens sake, and I definitely do not expect and even think that Singapore girls should kiss my feet and worship me just because I was in the army.<br><br>One last point I would like to state here is please do reply to my question in my previous post, and that is do you admit that there are good Singapore men out there too?<br><br>Please do feel free to reply and can I kindly request a courteous reply, because to tell you the truth, I have been controlling myself from losing my cool over this debate in the forum and I am controlling myself from getting angry even right now as I type this message, the main reason being that I think people have misunderstood me and think I want to brag and boast and think I am very great because I went through National Service.<br>That is not the case at all. Good day!        </div></blockquote>If your army uniform stink, it stink, dun tell me u smell a stink uniform and say it smell very nice like Channel nos 5 perfume? If so, u must be mad and untrue to yourself.<br><br>As a soldier you should be clean, tidy, button up, clean shave, look good with washed and straightened uniform when going home or going shopping. It is an honor and proud to give the public the good image of a perfect soldier who knows what is  hygience and proper dressing up. How can you protray an image of stink soldier which in the end give us a picture of poor cleaning and no responsibility of one image. SAF..stink army force?? Look at those officer cadets i used to see at MRT, so well dressed with long sleeve and very handsome too.<br><br>All singaporean feels great about NS, not only you, so are taiwan, thailand, brunei, israel, fuji and many other countries that need men to serve NS. And we as gals (be it mother or gf or daughters) also help to wash, cook and take care of them when they come home. No big deal, we all have our share of pride too.<br><br>There certainly are good men in Singapore, it just that most like to whine, need to be craddled and timid in front of gal.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Natalie, my most sincerest apologies to you, Angel 7030 and to anyone who thinks I am confrontational, I did not mean to be aggressive and/or confrontational.<br><br>Natalie, thanks so much for you earlier reply and your rather reasonable responses. Its good that we can come to agreement and consensus. From now on I just hope that nobody will insult/poke fun of me just becos I am male and on my part, I will make the effort not to be aggressive (I did not think I was an aggresive person anway) and instead be appreiative of what women do for men. I really hope that it will be 2 way traffic too, if you know what I mean.<br><br>Now may peace reign on this earth and God preserve it always!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just read this thread and just my personal point of views:<br><br>There are many different types of girls out there in the "open market". Some like ang-mo, some like locals. Some poke fun at men, some don't. And also, women are NOT pack animals. Women will side with women no matter whether it's the men's fault or the women fault because most women will think men are cheap. This goes for ang-mo as well. In fact I know that when it comes to the affair of the heart, women are more competitive than men.<br><br>Personally from my poly--&gt;uni--&gt;working days, I had encountered many women who preferred ang-mo. Well, its their preference and rights. There's a woman I used to love alot and is now getting married with an ang-mo from finland. Because what is really important is she's happy. Well... even if she's not happy, she made the choice right?<br><br>I understand TS's fustration but he will have to see the bigger picture:<br><br>1) There are alot of women out there so don't just because of a few then generalise all women. Respect them and they will respect you.<br><br>2) Singapore female to male ratio is 3:2. There's more women than men. Move on and find someone who suits you. If you really detest singapore women, then go for Foreign Talent (non-GL types pls!!).<br><br>3) While saying that SG girls don't appreciate SG guys, please just do a simple reflection on yourself and I mean on yourself only and not the entire male SG population and see if there is anything good or interesting about yourself that is to be worth appreciated by SG women.<br><br>It is always difficult to change other, so why not change yourself in becoming a better person? Good quality in a person will shine and women will be flocking to you, TS. Whining and blaming will only further your pain.<br><br>Anyway, I find local sg women quite good and no, i'm not ang-mo hor!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

WTF happened to this man's army?!<br><br>To point out something obvious enough for Stevie Wonder to see, officer cadets are called cadets because they've still got their training wheels on - they're not real soldiers yet.  For all of your nattering about what SAF stands for, you seem to have GQ in mind instead.<br><br>Not all of us are REMFs who have the luxury of prettying themselves up for the ignorant public's benefit.  When I've just spent five days out in the field eating canned slop and taking cover in the least damp spot I can find, the first thing I'm going to do when I get back to barracks is drop my gear, get an order list from all the lads of what they want to eat and head down to the nearest hawker centre to get it.  If you happen to be in the neighbourhood when I'm there, rest assured that your olfactory sensibilities sit right at the bottom of my list of priorities, if they make the list at all.  I've got absolutely no problems about how I smell because I've gotten that way doing real work, useless concessions to Miss Manners' code of hygiene be damned.<br><br>What do you know of how other countries' populations treat their national servicemen?  When we were in Taiwan, we stank to high heaven after trudging over hill after hill throughout the day, and civilians still came up to us and offered us shelter in their own homes so we wouldn't have to spend the night freezing our nuts off.  It's a far cry from your call for a pretty, sweet-smelling, spit-and-polish army - them folks had a clear idea of what soldiers do, which is more than I can say for you.<br><br>Until you get a clue of what soldiering's about, I suggest that you steer clear of the topic - frankly, you're too ignorant to have any business telling anyone what a soldier should do.  There's no demand for absolute deference to NS men, but this sort of sanctimony is ludicrous, especially when coming from someone who obviously lacks the first clue.</div>
