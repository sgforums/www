WTF happened to this man's army?!<br><br>To point out something obvious enough for Stevie Wonder to see, officer cadets are called cadets because they've still got their training wheels on - they're not real soldiers yet.  For all of your nattering about what SAF stands for, you seem to have GQ in mind instead.<br><br>Not all of us are REMFs who have the luxury of prettying themselves up for the ignorant public's benefit.  When I've just spent five days out in the field eating canned slop and taking cover in the least damp spot I can find, the first thing I'm going to do when I get back to barracks is drop my gear, get an order list from all the lads of what they want to eat and head down to the nearest hawker centre to get it.  If you happen to be in the neighbourhood when I'm there, rest assured that your olfactory sensibilities sit right at the bottom of my list of priorities, if they make the list at all.  I've got absolutely no problems about how I smell because I've gotten that way doing real work, useless concessions to Miss Manners' code of hygiene be damned.<br><br>What do you know of how other countries' populations treat their national servicemen?  When we were in Taiwan, we stank to high heaven after trudging over hill after hill throughout the day, and civilians still came up to us and offered us shelter in their own homes so we wouldn't have to spend the night freezing our nuts off.  It's a far cry from your call for a pretty, sweet-smelling, spit-and-polish army - them folks had a clear idea of what soldiers do, which is more than I can say for you.<br><br>Until you get a clue of what soldiering's about, I suggest that you steer clear of the topic - frankly, you're too ignorant to have any business telling anyone what a soldier should do.  There's no demand for absolute deference to NS men, but this sort of sanctimony is ludicrous, especially when coming from someone who obviously lacks the first clue.</div></blockquote>Well, i thot army boys must parade themselve smartly to face the public, how can u go up a bus or MRT smelling like shit, look at those US army, when they check out the camp, they are so smartly dressed decorated with medals and guy's perfume ready to embrace their love ones.<br><br>If your seniors never teach you about hygiene and serve the public well, i think most of our taxes paid to SAF must hv gone to waste. For every successful soldier, there stand behind a successful woman with him thru thick and thin.<br><br>I may be not be a soldier, but I had been a school brownie before, we had 2 sets of uniform,  and we were told after training to clean ourselve up, wear the new uniform nicely to give a good impression upon the public that we are discipline and ready to serve.<br><br>As far as this is concern, soldier should hve a good image in the public, for your training, of course you can be dirty and smelly, if not you aint a good soldier. And lastly if not the least,  good soldier don't whine, respect the ladies and carry on with his job.</div>

How much time have you spent stateside, and how many American soldiers do you know?  Do you know any army wives, Singaporean or otherwise, and how they view their husbands' jobs?  If not, what can you claim about knowing about the successful women behind the successful soldiers?<br><br>Ooooh, school Brownies - I guess that makes you a twenty-star general, doesn't it?  Wake up and smell the coffee.  Did you have to stay out for weeks at a time without resupply, much less amenities such as showers?  Have you been stuck in the middle of a 6-hour downpour with no hope of even a change of socks for the next week?  Have you carried 55kg of gear on your back up and down thickly-overgrown hills for 35 kilometres, then make sure your post is hidden not only from your surroundings but from the air as well, and then uproot everything the next morning to do it all over again day after day?<br><br>If the answer to the above is no, then get a grip and stop trying to pretend that you know what you're talking about.<br><br>Your ignorance is astounding.  Your pitiful tax dollars don't go to creating pretty boys who strut up and down MRT stations smelling like a bunch of roses - your tax dollars go to making sure your ungrateful arse is kept safe.<br><br>I'll concede that when booking out, soldiers are expected to maintain a minimum of bearing and presentation.  What I have a problem with is your sweeping generalisation that soldiers need to be prettied up like OCS cadets, clean-shaven, dressed in long sleeves and (gag) looking handsome.<br><br>Yes, I've done the whole prettied-up routine as part of the guard of honour at the NDP.  The fact is that it's got bugger-all to do with being a good soldier - give me a sloppy, stinky bugger who can shoot straight and cover my back anytime.<br><br>Since you obviously lack the insight, I'll put in in perspective for you.  A nurse in A&amp;E has had someone bleed all over her during her shift, and she's on the homeward-bound bus smelling like an abbatoir.  Are you going to hold it against her and say she's a bad nurse?<br><br>Grow up and get a grip on reality.  If, and that's a big if, you're going to judge anyone, judge them by their actions, not by how they look or smell.  Right now you're as bad as the thread starter, running off with red herring.<br><br>Hell, I'm well out of the game these days so I don't have a vested interest.  I've traded in camouflage gear for merino wool, Egyptian cotton and hand-woven silk, but having been on the sharp end on national policy, I'll always give the respect that our lads in uniform deserve instead of harping on about irrelevant BS.</div>

If so, I am remiss in expecting you to conclude that the problems that I have highlighted need to be addressed.<br><br>There's no need to appeal to my "Singaporean generousity" - all you needed to do was ask "What the hell do you mean by that?" if you didn't get it in the first place. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I'll preface the following by saying that I'm deliberately operating in broad strokes here - I expect that I'd lose you by getting into too much detail, and my objective is to show you the overall picture.<br><br>Your key mistake is that you're not formulating the issue in a sensible manner.  Do Singaporean univeristy-educated girls in fact prefer Caucasians?  What information do you have supporting this conclusion?  Are you examining this issue in a rational manner?<br><br>Most importantly, are you ascribing your current situation to the correct causes?<br><br>You assume that Singaporean men are more introverted than Caucasian males.  That, perhaps, could be true.  However, what's to say that extraversion is proportionate to women's preferences, especially within a culture that assumes, if not encourages, a certain level of introversion?  Is there such a thing as too much extraversion?  All things being equal, we're likely to be talking about sum zero here.<br><br>Setting that aside for the moment, let's look at the other issues.<br><br>First, you say that Singaporeans grow up under a fair amount of parental pressure, and that Singaporean men have to perform national service.  Well and good - let's take those as being facts upon the basis of their being self-evident.<br><br>Having taken them as facts, the next question is, "So what?".  Regardless of the external conditions, one has internal control over whether one deals with the circumstances or implodes.<br><br>This brings up a key dimension that far exceeds the importance of extraversion/intorversion: where does your locus of control lie?  Put in plain English, are you the victim of your circumstances or are you the master of your own destiny?  If you are indeed the master of your own destiny, does that not give you the edge over someone who's not experienced parental pressure and the challenges of military service?<br><br>Even if you were to take a sociobiological perspective (which I don't - humans have much more control over their primal drives than this perspective suggests), one who takes control of the situation is definitely more attrctive than the sad sap who whines about the circumstances.<br><br>Now, to be fair, Americans are so "can do" it's utterly annoying, but within the current framework, it's not so much their being Caucasian that might make them attractive, it's their outlook.<br><br>Is this outlook the reflection of some cultural difference?  No way.  It's evident enough in history that no one culture has an exclusive franchise to the "can do" mentality; after all, would Chinese culture have expanded that much if this was the case?  Would the Indians have stopped Alexander at Malli?  Would Singapore not have remained a simple port?<br><br>So, we've established that internal locus of control is a much more influential factor than skin colour, and that no culture holds exclusive rights to it.  It's entirely up to you.<br><br>How, I'm going to give you a modicum of respect and leave it to you to join the dots.</div>
