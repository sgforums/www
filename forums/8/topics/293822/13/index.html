Seriously, no where in the near future or even in 40-100 years can i see Singapore being invaded by our neighbors.<br><br>Lets have a look at our neighboring countries:<br><br>Malaysia: Come on... You really think its ever going to happen? For hell, our old politicians say we rely on our friends to the north. Not gonna happen.<br><br>Indonesia: Part of ASEAN, if this ever happens, the shits gonna hit the ceiling and  really im quite sure Indonesia realizes theres no chance with a US navy base here, plus also the fact that the Malaysian will side with us, after all, one of the retreat tactics is to retreat into Malaysia if ever Indonesia hits us.<br><br>Thailand: Much too far away for them to do anything to us. Yes they have one air craft carrier, but our air force could take them on easily. A land invasion will be too much trouble, and all for what?<br><br>Laos, Cambodia, Burma/Myanmar, Vietnam: I really don't think they have anything against us or ever will.<br><br>So, as we can see, there is a need for an army, yes, but for NS? Not too sure. Our defence force is really surrounded and aimed towards our commandos and our air force. I often read of our support battalions being sent off to New Zealand and India to fight in the rolling hills and deserts of those countries. Wait a moment, when did Singapore EVER have those types of terrains? Oh yeah maybe 200 years ago... but not now. The way the army is training our soldiers i feel is going in the wrong direction, and for the wrong reasons, i personally feel this is caused by the old politicians still in parliament. Not that they did a bad job making singapore what it is now, but its time for a change.<br><br>This 2 years is really ridiculous, whoever said we need that time to train NS guys must be stupid. The swiss and the dutch do it for 6 months, thats all they need. Put us in the companies and battalions and whatever, yes incase of the ever need to do whatever. That would take a year, whats the extra year for? My brother and my cousins both went in, it became an extra year of crap, total waste of time in the governments money and their time. Its a hell of a pity considering a lot can be done in one year. </div></blockquote>If singapore is not going to be attack, what is the meaning of total defence, what is the use of going for NS, wasting our brothers, boyfriends, husbands sons, father and even grandpa times. What is the main objective then??<br><br>What is singapore navy good at??? Catching pirate and illegal immigrant coming from sea only. And even that, their cruise ship can be knock off the sea by a Merchant vessel because of the Navy blur Capt fault ended with TWO NAVY GALS death!!!, one of them my elder sister classmate too.<br><br>The Army, only good at parading themselves during National parade or SAF day, So is serving NS only for parading???<br><br>The Air forces, with it arrogance pilots flying up and down Singapore making so much noises, one day I am going to shoot them down, yet they go australia, US train and have free holiday, gals, and enjoy with high class clubs, and well paid, for what, did they experienced dog fight, just flew from changi to tuas and go back only, waste our tax money, and jet fuel is damn expensive now ok. We pay them to fly and disturb us.</div>
