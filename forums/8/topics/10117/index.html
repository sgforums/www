With effect since this morning, his new title should be the Director of the PR department.<br><br>What a price he paid for it, but business hiearchy is like that. He had sacrificed yet another just to satisfy his thirst for power.<br><br>He stubbed out his fag and stretched his fat body, wobbling his tummy. Yawning, he opened his email and composed a reminder to his new secretary to chase for his new name plague and name cards.<br><br>Okay, time to get home and put on some "mourning" clothes for the wake.<br><br>------------------<br>You are poison... poison running through my veins...<br><br>Poison...
