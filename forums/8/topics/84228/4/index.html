Especially JAL.  It is a Japanese Airlines and u need to understand the culture. They emphasize a lot on image and posture. Bun your hair up as well. It will give them an idea of how u will look like in their uniform. First impression are the most important. Once you make a good impression, Next is the way you carry yourself. Maintain the correct posture while sitting and standing. Even during waiting before the interview. You will never know who will be walking past. Even the staff outside might comment on you to the panel.<br><br>Just my 2 cents worth.... Hope it is useful.</div>

The height is confirmed to be 1.58m for SIA.<br>SIA interview comprises of a two days interview. The first day, you will have to get through the height and weight section. Then after that you will have to read an inflight announcement. Next will be a one to one interview. If you pass through all these, you will be invited for the second interview on another day.<br><br>One the second interview, there will be three stages of selection. First stage, you will be asked to give a short presentation. This is a test of your ability to speak well and carry yourself well. I think the second stage is the group interaction. It is to test oneÂ’s ability to conduct themselves in a group. The final stage will be the swimming stage. You will be asked to jump into a pool and swim/float/paddle over to other side. It is not a test one's ability to swim. It is to ensure that their cabin crew will be able to save passengers if there is an emergency that they need to land on water.<br><br>I think cabin crew is not all a coffee and tea job. The main duty of a cabin crew is to ensure the safety of passengers on board. Serving meals and drinks are considered secondary duties. I strongly encourage those people to join the airline. It is one of the few jobs that allow you to travel for free. The experiences and exposure that you gained will be something for you to remember for life.<br></div></blockquote>I believe that will be a very good experience.

But as a matter of fact, it is not always the case. It is the same as in an office anvironment, some people are b itchy and are some are not. Aircrew are probably one of the most misunderstood occupation around. They are still people doing a job.<br><br>So personally i do not think that b itchiness shld be restricted to the airline industry. Do not always believe in what you heard. It is quite a pleasant job actually. There is terrible crew like those office b itch too. But not all are like that. Most are nice.</div>
