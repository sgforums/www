If you don't correct your behavior now, you will never survive in the working world. There you will have to tolerate your boss and you will have more work to do than the one you are currently doing in school.<br><br>So while you are in school, try to look at it at the bright side. You said that the authority is abusing their power but you never give us any example of how they abuse their power. Sometimes they did what they did to maintain the discipline of the students in the school, so if your idea of them abusing power is punishing you because of some things you did that are against the rules, then you only have yourself to blame.<br><br>And about the food, nobody forces you to eat it if you dun like it. Can always go outside and eat or ta pau something that you like to eat. And don't be so picky abt the food in the school canteen la, it is not a restaurant in a 5-star hotel for goodness sake...be thankful you have sth to eat to fill your stomach...I think you are too pampered by life, that is why you are complaining abt all these petty matters instead of looking at the ones that really matter.</div>
