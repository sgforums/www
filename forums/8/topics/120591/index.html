Once you choose the line, you'll probably remain there forever (eg. water treatment, oil/gas/petrochem, machinery, valves, pumps, etc etc).<br><br>Then the rest is up to you....how you perform, your luck, etc.  Then slowly move step to step up the ladder...and if the right opportunities come, jump to another company and continue your climb there.  The most important thing is that you have to keep learning.....learn some accounts and management and get involved in them at work too, if possible.<br><br>Then one day, when you see an advert for sales managers/directors....apply lor.  Tell them all your experiences, knowledge (eg. accounts, planning, management, etc)...and try till you get employed.<br><br>Then hor, when you have enough experience and confidence....this is the trickiest step.....approach foreign companies which want to start branches in Asia.  Ask them to employ you and you run the show for them in Asia.  Then you can be your own boss without risking your own money.  You also can be other people's boss <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">.<br><br>(Worked for me.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">).<br><br></div>
