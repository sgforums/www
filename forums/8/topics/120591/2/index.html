Only deal with chemical reaction rate (Woh can kill)<br><br>You will also be dealing with process control, unit operations, thermodyanmics, heat n mass transfer, fluid mech and such<br><br>Basically, chemical engineer is jack of all trade (We learn but our field is unit operation  (mass and energy balance)<br><br>- is the stuff u learn tough? as compared to other schools?<br>YES it is one of the worst engineering area u can have<br>I would claim that mech and elec are nothing compare to chemical eng<br>however, I believe those ppl from mech and elec would disagree with me<br>everything is tough lar, who would claim that their course is simple<br><br>- what are the prospects and rice bowl and job market of the different engineering field?<br>You want golden rice bowl go NIE lar. However, it no longer golden rice bowl now also.<br>Jurong island is the place for you most prob.<br><br>Shell and exxonmobil are also likely places for you, provide you manage to do well and pass their interview.
