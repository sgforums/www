Its the companies and the FTs who are put here to guard the companies who become rich....its local engineers are just expendable labourers.<br><br>Immediately after graduation (in the 90's), I worked for a company before where the FT played golf 3 days a week and didn't even know what products we had.  And just his house rental (at Bukit Timah area) alone was S$12,000 per month.  And I?  As a fresh grad at that time and asked for a starting basic pay of S$2400.  He cut it down to S$1800.  That time economy bad...no choice...lan-lan take the job and worked 10-14 hours a day, 6 days a week.<br><br>Basket....his house rental S$12000 per month, then his home leave donno how many thousand per year, and his kids education lah, company car lah, salary lah, bonus lah, etc etc.....then he cut my asking pay by S$600.<br><br>After a few years, I became smart and offered myself to a competitor at 2.5 times of my own market value. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div></blockquote>Hmm, for ur minor, you chose in ur final year??</div>

Most engineers don't stay in their technical positions for very long. People study engineering to build up a solid technical foundation and to train up analytical thinking skills, but eventually most engineers would want to progress to management or other non-engineering-related positions. Hence the constant demand for new engineers in the market.<br><br>Point is: It doesn't really matter what field you specialise in, if your final career objective is not an engineering or technical position. Industry trends are dynamic, and nobody knows for sure which industry is going to boom or stay in Singapore for long. Instead of going with the flow, why not just choose a path which you are comfortable with, or which you think you'd excel in? The grade/class of your honours degree would help immensely in landing that first job.</div>
