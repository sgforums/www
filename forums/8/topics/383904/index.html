              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I work in a welfare home. Just a few days ago, we had an unhappy
              encounter with a paramedic officer.</p>
              <p>One of our resident choked and her life was in danger, and hence
              ambulance was called in. Fortunately, our resident was saved and
              revived on time by our nurses in the Home.</p>
              <p>To be fair, ambulance arrived exactly after 15mins after call
              was made. However, when the paramedic officers came, one of our
              staff who was extremely anxious about resident's life, kind of
              raised her voice and asked "What took you so long?" the paramedic
              officer instead of being sensitive of the anxiousness, he flared up
              and shouted at our staff rudely. He quoted while pointing fingers
              at our staff: " I rushed from braddell, you think I'm a superman?"
              He also shouted and said "it's fifteen minutes, if you don't
              believe, you can go verify with my doctor!" He was very rude, hence
              another staff who got agitated with that reaction also raised her
              voice " What kind of attitude was that?" The paramedic then kept
              quiet and stormed off to the location of where the resident
              was.</p>
              <p>Upon seeing the resident, he did not immediately check the
              resident's vital signs etc, instead he asked alot of questions, I
              am not sure what kind of procedures he is supposed to do, but
              usually the other paramedic officers (previous encounters) would
              check for vital signs etc first. After checking like for 15mins,
              they finally decided to send the resident to hospital.</p>
              <p>Before they left, that paramedic officer who was rude earlier,
              took the remarks from the staff earlier personally, and questioned
              the other staff of the staffs' names earlier and claimed that those
              staff accused him and even mentioned that he would lodge a complain
              against the staff. He also mentioned that " the resident is fine,
              and you do not have to teach me what to do!" (Nobody was teaching
              him what to do.) His no sense of urgency really pissed all of us
              off. I don't care if he had a bad day or what, but before he reach
              the resident, isn't he supposed to see an urgency of a human's life
              who is already in danger? Our resident was not saved by him, but by
              our staff nurses and nursing team, who is he to be so stucked
              up?</p>
              <p>Being a certified first aider, I know that if a person
              stopped breathing and if oxygen does not reach the brain for more
              than 7-10mins, the person would die. He, as paramedic, doesn't he
              know?</p>
              <p>He is totally rude and I really think he is not fit to be a
              paramedic officer. Thank goodness our resident was fine. All thanks
              to our wonderful nursing staff.</p>

              <p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Do some reflection on yourself. The paramedic officer is not the driver. And they have to follow traffic rules to come down there. It is not that they drink coffee delaying the time. Instead of thanking them for coming, you all have greeted him with rude remarks. </span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">
              </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The staff who raise her voice, is being very rude. She should say, "thank you for coming. I will show you the resident"</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I think you all have taken  granted that the paramedic is offering you a service. You should be delighted that he came and not to complain. </p>
              <p></p>
              <p>If the resident is fine, talking and why do you need to check for vital signs. Choking will dies within 3-5 mins if he cannot breathe. If you really know some medical skills, you should fetch the patient to hospital by taxi. Instead of calling the ambulance to come. </p>

              <p>To Lokey: If he had not shouted rudely back, we would have said
              thank you to him. What's wrong with being anxious, isn't he
              supposed to be sympathetic? He didn't rushed too when they reached,
              he was walking slowly as if the resident was fine before he even
              saw the resident. Seriously, you have no regards of human life too?
              If it had happened to your family, won't you be anxious and raised
              your voice? It wasn't even a loud shout..We understand that the
              traffic could delay them, but that doesn't mean that he could be
              that rude in replying, right? How ccan you be sure if resident is
              fine, if u are medically certified, how can you make such remarks?
              Resident nearly died, her face turned blue, lips turned black and
              stopped breathing, yah, she was revived, but she choked, shouldn't
              check vital signs? What if she had any other problems?</p>

              <p>Dear All,</p>
              <p>If he did rushed to the scene, we really appreciated it, but
              before knowing whether resident is fine, he walked really slowly to
              the scene. Together with his rude attitude, that's why I posted
              this online. So all you mean that, if you stressed, hungry, busy,
              you can be rude too? You mean we are not even allowed to question
              anything? It was just a remark "What took you so long?" If you are
              anxious, will you raised your voice too? if it's your family's
              life in danger, what will you do? It's his no sense of urgency that
              pissed us off..not only that attitude.</p>
              <p>Shouldn't he had attended to the resident first instead of
              taking the remark personally?</p>

              <p>he take the remark personally = he wrong</p>
              <p>you take his remark personally = you right ?</p>
              <p>logic fail?</p>
              <p>rushing =/= professionalism</p>
              <p>rushing = possible fatal mistakes</p>
              <p>if u really got a case here, u will be calling police and the hospital to complain instead of here. this prove that you got nothing to back your own complaint</p>
              <p>sorry if i sound mean</p>

                  yourself. The paramedic officer is not the driver. And they have to
                  follow traffic rules to come down there. It is not that they drink
                  coffee delaying the time. Instead of thanking them for coming, you
                  all have greeted him with rude remarks. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The staff who raise her
                  voice, is being very rude. She should say, "thank you for coming. I
                  will show you the resident"</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">I think you all have taken  granted that the paramedic is
                  offering you a service. You should be delighted that he came and
                  not to complain. </p>
              <p>If the resident is fine, talking and why do you need to check
                  for vital signs. Choking will dies within 3-5 mins if he
                  cannot breathe. If you really know some medical skills, you should
                  fetch the patient to hospital by taxi. Instead of calling the
                  ambulance to come. </p>

              <p>Emergency lah...the greetings can come after the issue at hand is resolved.</p>
              <p>What the paramedic is doing in not as simple as "offering a service", it is much more than that, as his work involves the lives of those he works with. It is his job, <strong>his duty</strong>.</p>
              <p>As far as I am concerned, he should be fucking doing his job, afterwhich he can complain all the wants. There is no need to aggravate the already-stressed staff..</p>
              <p>To TS:</p>
              <p>Why the hell did the ambulance take 15 mins? Was it not possible for the dispatch to contact ambulances on standby close to the location of the home? I suggest you check with the relevant authorities; a 15 minute response time for an emergency ambulance is too long. Unless you called for a non-emergency ambulance to <strong>make sure</strong> that the resident of the home was alright after the object obstructing the airway was removed successfully, 15 minutes is actually pretty OK.</p>
              <p>Choking can be addressed by the staff at the home who are trained and able to use the Heimlich manoeuver..calling an ambulance would be unnecessary..</p>

              <p>I assumed that the paramedic officer was from the SCDF EAS &amp; not from a private ambulance company..</p>
              <p>I myself was also previously from an EAS crew &amp; have encountered countless number of people asking why did the ambulance arrived so late, etc..the most simple reason is firstly we respond to countless number of 995 calls every single day, some are considered real emergency cases &amp; some are not. 2nd, the control centre will always dispatch an ambulance nearest to your incident location but assuming if its out for call, then the next nearest will be dispatched.</p>
              <p>It also boils down to motorists who fail to give way to emergency ambulances which may also affect the arrival time..not saying you're in the wrong but some people who call for the EAS have some attitude problem of their own &amp; we're not your so-called punching bag..</p>
              <p>Lastly, it may be a good idea to take up some BCLS courses so that you can do your part (instead of doing nothing) while waiting for the ambulance to arrive @ location..</p>

              <p>I work in a welfare home. Just a few days ago, we had an unhappy encounter with a paramedic officer.</p>
              <p>One of our resident choked and her life was in danger, and hence ambulance was called in. Fortunately, our resident was saved and revived on time by our nurses in the Home.</p>
              <p>To be fair, ambulance arrived exactly after 15mins after call was made. However, when the paramedic officers came, one of our staff who was extremely anxious about resident's life, kind of raised her voice and asked "What took you so long?" the paramedic officer instead of being sensitive of the anxiousness, he flared up and shouted at our staff rudely. He quoted while pointing fingers at our staff: " I rushed from braddell, you think I'm a superman?" He also shouted and said "it's fifteen minutes, if you don't believe, you can go verify with my doctor!" He was very rude, hence another staff who got agitated with that reaction also raised her voice " What kind of attitude was that?" The paramedic then kept quiet and stormed off to the location of where the resident was.</p>
              <p>Upon seeing the resident, he did not immediately check the resident's vital signs etc, instead he asked alot of questions, I am not sure what kind of procedures he is supposed to do, but usually the other paramedic officers (previous encounters) would check for vital signs etc first. After checking like for 15mins, they finally decided to send the resident to hospital.</p>
              <p>Before they left, that paramedic officer who was rude earlier, took the remarks from the staff earlier personally, and questioned the other staff of the staffs' names earlier and claimed that those staff accused him and even mentioned that he would lodge a complain against the staff. He also mentioned that " the resident is fine, and you do not have to teach me what to do!" (Nobody was teaching him what to do.) His no sense of urgency really pissed all of us off. I don't care if he had a bad day or what, but before he reach the resident, isn't he supposed to see an urgency of a human's life who is already in danger? Our resident was not saved by him, but by our staff nurses and nursing team, who is he to be so stucked up?</p>
              <p>Being a certified first aider, I know that if a person stopped breathing and if oxygen does not reach the brain for more than 7-10mins, the person would die. He, as paramedic, doesn't he know?</p>
              <p>He is totally rude and I really think he is not fit to be a paramedic officer. Thank goodness our resident was fine. All thanks to our wonderful nursing staff.</p>

              <p>Doesn;t matter whose right and whose wrong. It's a matter of perception. What's important is that everyone did what they were tasked to do, and the resident is cared for.</p>
              <p>Yesterday tempers flared. Today tempers flare, tmr tempers will still flare. There's no absolute right or wrong. ladies and gentlemen living in the same society willhave to tolerate eaach other.</p>

              <p>medics are trained to save people , not anger management.</p>
              <p>you tell people "What took you so long!?",you are obviously questioning him &amp; doubt his professionalism.</p>
              <p>What the paramedic said is true, hes not a superman neither is the driver.I`m sure the medic already know the situation HAS ALREADY BEEN IN CONTROL,sense of urgency sometimes are "just for show" for your info. The medic indeed is not professional enough to put up a good show or rather entertain people like you and your staff.</p>
              <p>Probably next time a "anger management" should be considered in the medic training module.</p>
              <p>From a neutral point of view , you and your staff shouldnt have doubt him or question him in a demanding way in the 1st place,a quick &amp; urgent 15min journey is made yet no one appreciate...put urself in the paramedic shoe!</p>

              really we were not there so what actually happened we don't know.
              but i can say who was the paramedic? let the paramedic do his job. where is your location. what was the timing and traffic condition then. 15mins to your location fast or not? if speed more people will die.
                          
              how did the resident got choked? must be you guys or nurse fault in the first place for not careful. if you side more careful no choking will happen.
                      
              see point finger we are the best. why choke? why? who cause the choking pipes?

              <p>With regards to Mastermoogle's posting, it's not that we do not want to complain, but my protocol does not allow us to complain. And the point is, I am posting here because I want to people to know how rude that particular paramedic officer was, and how <strong>he actually treated a human life with little seriousness</strong>. It's not about them rushing or not rushing, really. I admit our staff was rude, but that doesn't mean that he should be equally rude, right? I am trying to say that I am not taking his remarks personally, as it is not about me taking his remarks personally anyway. His remarks was not even towards me anyway. It's just that his attitude is the worst that I have ever seen.</p>
