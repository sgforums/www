              <p>Maybe because I did not state that, our staff had already opened
              the main door, and there are at least 3 staff there waiting for the
              paramedics, and to lead the way to the resident.</p>
              <p><strong>I am NOT trying to push blame here, and by the way, I
              admitted in earlier posts that my staff was at fault
              initially.</strong> The reason I posted here is not asking everyone
              single one of you to side us or to side the paramedic. I am just
              posting here to let people know that there is this kind of
              paramedic who is rude and has no sense of urgency when he
              reached.</p>
              <p>My point here is, he can do his job first before quarrelling
              with the staff.  He can do so after he saw the resident
              and ensure that the resident is fine.</p>
              <p>I agree that it's human error. I totally agree that it takes two
              hands to clap. It's my staff fault at first, but don't you think
              the paramedic reaction was doublely rude? Plus, he took his own
              sweet time despite there is already another staff there
              waiting to lead the way, the staff rushed ahead, expecting the
              paramedic to follow, when the staff turned around, no sight of
              paramedic. If you call this professionalism, I got nothing to
              say.</p>

              <p>he would have already been tensed up (where he could have witnessed a lost of life, despite doing his best)</p>
              <p><span style="background-color: #ffffff; ">Remarks stating his lack of professionism,  where he, himself, and his co workers who rushed to your place immediately after receiving the news, would surely get a retaliative remark which would take no longer than a a few seconds.</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">I respect the paramedics, and I would not think that they are wrong. They work in an environment where they are constantly under intense pressure, they are in the line of saving lives -- where i stand firm on my belief that they will perform to their very best in every job they receive, in ensuring the well being, and the safety of their patient.  </span></p>
              <p>I would too believe that t<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">he paramedics receive lots of cases daily, it's the very least that one should say a simple word of thanks to them, and not be naive in your thinkings .</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">These people have nerves of steel,  to perform in situations that concern the life or death of a patient. However, these nerves of steel do snap, and it's human's nature after all. It's natural for humans to do that. </span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">IN many of your other posts, you stated that it's your staff's fault, however, none were said to be your fault. If you could have thought from the paramedic's point of view, and  understanding how immense the pressure they are facing daily. You could have stopped your fellow working from lambasting. </span></p>

              kannabu ceebai. i know of people who photoshop the truth one side and i know the truth and seen people who only know how to point finger at a problem here and there.
                  
                  sue and take the paramedic to court instead of complaining here.
              
              In a situation like this. tell all people and crowd busy bodies clear the area. One to take charge if have experience or trained in such situation should step forward and  control the situation and take charge. shout if you have to if people do not clear the area or obey your instructions. others who have CPR or revival skills, knowledge or experience step forward to assist if need to. Call ambulance meanwhile.
              
              usually there are some reasons why you get shouted at. 
              
              (1) because you shout at people first
              (2) because the paramedic got shouted at always for nothing
              (3) because what actually happen were not told here since no one here was there when it happened
              (4) TS got a fcuking face that the paramedic one look see don't like already
              (5) the paramedic got a fcuk face that TS one look see don't like already
              
              
              i still question why choking pipes? was it the rubbish not properly preapred? Pipes already got problem, or the resident purposing or do not know hoe to control the rrate at which the rubbish should be thrown into the sanitary pipes? or suicidal tentency? Siao keng? the resident in the right state of mind when eating? if Siao one should be feed instead of letting them eat on thie own. why why the chkin pipes i want to know answer me now

              <p>For those who worked in the welfare homes, or deem themselves to be 'better' because they worked in a welfare home and thus are better judged of professionalism and acceptable behaviour. </p>

              attack, assault, defend? so childish. i will post more tube vids later
              
              no its not the welfare home. its you. were you the one who caused the resident to choke? which welfare home you from? what you wrote here about choking were it even true or did you just bull sheet here anyhow write. whcih welfare home you from. we will go check it out and see if this really happened. to see if really you work there. if so why. need to know why it happened. why didn't you helped when you know how to work as a paramedic. why you bystand and never do anything. why only can raise your voice. if it happened why no investigation on the pipes chokin? what was the cause. can it be prevented. were it due to you or your people volunteers not attentive? do you all need retraining? were the resident problematic in the first place. were the wast properlly prepared or treated? were time enough given for the resident to throw the waste in the pipes? how was morale and conditions like in the home. were the resident not happy because of the conditions? or were the resident not happy of their own fate? why you never take legal actions against the paramedic for being rude. why you never approach the paramedic superiors for his behavior or maybe his parents for his behaviors. did your parents teach you in the first place about being rude and respect? or were your parents like that in the first place? or all becasue big auntie came. did you jusy lost 4d yesterday or kids problems hubby misbehave outside. your family not better either. you regret voluunteering or think volunteering makes a god out of you. why whyw hy?

              <p>TS.... seems like a welfare home enough for ppl to stay in... but do the public know what really goes on and on inside... no one does... why not send in a P I and let the public know how they handle those patients inside...?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>U (TS) question our professionalism and question why we were late...?</p>
              <p>1st - blame on those public who always call for the slightest incident when it doesnt require our services... when you can still walk around arguing which hospital you wan to go...</p>
              <p>2nd - public who treated us (Emergency Ambulance Services) like free taxis... they needed a tranport just to go for appointment at hospital? CALL 1777!</p>
              <p>3rd - how can the patient choke under your care... accidents does happen... even so why arent you ppl trained how to handle choked cases...</p>
              <p>4th - ignorance public who always think we abuse sirens for nothing... refuses to give way to us...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dont take our services for granted... example for SARS and H1N1 period... public only thank the Nurses at the hospital for their brave courage and care they give out... but why are the Ambulance crews always forgotten when they are those front liners who face them and transport them to hospital FIRST? If we are not so great to you ppl... don expect too much from us either... as we gain nothing for saving your relatives lives... who really appreciate and thanks us for our hardwork when patients are SAVED! you ppl only complaint this and that... buy food also wan to STOMP us... WE ARE HUMANS... NOT GOD! We need to rest, eat and drink too... like YOU IGNORANCE PUBLIC are...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BE THANKFUL!</p>
              <p>p.s : lastly... WE ARE NOT SUPERMAN! WE CANNOT REACH THE INSTANCE YOU CALL 995!</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>I work in a welfare home. Just a few days ago, we had an unhappy encounter with a paramedic officer.</p>
              <p>One of our resident choked and her life was in danger, and hence ambulance was called in. Fortunately, our resident was saved and revived on time by our nurses in the Home.</p>
              <p>To be fair, ambulance arrived exactly after 15mins after call was made. However, when the paramedic officers came, one of our staff who was extremely anxious about resident's life, kind of raised her voice and asked "What took you so long?" the paramedic officer instead of being sensitive of the anxiousness, he flared up and shouted at our staff rudely. He quoted while pointing fingers at our staff: " I rushed from braddell, you think I'm a superman?" He also shouted and said "it's fifteen minutes, if you don't believe, you can go verify with my doctor!" He was very rude, hence another staff who got agitated with that reaction also raised her voice " What kind of attitude was that?" The paramedic then kept quiet and stormed off to the location of where the resident was.</p>
              <p>Upon seeing the resident, he did not immediately check the resident's vital signs etc, instead he asked alot of questions, I am not sure what kind of procedures he is supposed to do, but usually the other paramedic officers (previous encounters) would check for vital signs etc first. After checking like for 15mins, they finally decided to send the resident to hospital.</p>
              <p>Before they left, that paramedic officer who was rude earlier, took the remarks from the staff earlier personally, and questioned the other staff of the staffs' names earlier and claimed that those staff accused him and even mentioned that he would lodge a complain against the staff. He also mentioned that " the resident is fine, and you do not have to teach me what to do!" (Nobody was teaching him what to do.) His no sense of urgency really pissed all of us off. I don't care if he had a bad day or what, but before he reach the resident, isn't he supposed to see an urgency of a human's life who is already in danger? Our resident was not saved by him, but by our staff nurses and nursing team, who is he to be so stucked up?</p>
              <p>Being a certified first aider, I know that if a person stopped breathing and if oxygen does not reach the brain for more than 7-10mins, the person would die. He, as paramedic, doesn't he know?</p>
              <p>He is totally rude and I really think he is not fit to be a paramedic officer. Thank goodness our resident was fine. All thanks to our wonderful nursing staff.</p>

              <p>.(but i wont comment much, just on professionalism)</p>
              <p>im a nursing student and medic(v).</p>
              <p>in this case, its your fault. your attitute to the paramedic.<br>if you're in his shoe, you will never post this, i swear.<br><br>you mentioned you're a CERTIFIED FIRST AIDER in a welfare home, but did you help the paramedic by letting him know all the crucial details to make his and your life easier.<br><br>in this case, we can lodge a complain to MOH or MOM about you instead, and made it big on paper. you decide.</p>
              <p>and you mention that the patient was revived by nurses. of cos we need to question.<br>its part of it, so that when we pass it to police, its easier to knw who is involved.</p>
              <p>we ask questions cos you didnt answer that to HQ while you called.<br>when you called, you should described in detail, so when we reach, we can spring onto action. you wasted the time, not us.</p>
              <p>next thing.<br>try being a paramedic.<br>im in, i can tell you its different then in nursing. <br>nursing is in a controlled environment. everything stablised. BED SIDE NURSING<br>paramedics are dealing with pre-hosp care, so they need whatever info, so the receiving hospital can check the history. and the stress of being a paramedic is higher then of even a chief surgeon in OT. cos every smallest details can cause patient to die while enroute.</p>
              <p>you think about your jobscope and the paramedic's, what is there to compare?<br>if its urgent enough, they would have sent the paramedic bikers down. not just the ambulance alone. thats the protocol.</p>
              <p>your detailing is too brief that it doesnt look like an emergency case. cos you've said its a choking case but revived, so since you have saved the patient, i dont see the point, what we have to do is to sent to hosp to stablise condition there.</p>
              <p>if you are so proud of being able to this without our paramedics, be a paramedic yourself. alot have tried, but failed the final evaluation test. if it looks easy, they wont be a nurse, they should be doctors or even senior consultant, then they can say this paramedic is not fit in his or her job.</p>
              <p>what are you, in a paramedic's eye?</p>
              <p>ranking wise<br>First aider -&gt; Trained First Aider -&gt; Nurses -&gt; Medic / Nurse (Emergency/ Critical Care) -&gt; Paramedic -&gt; Doctor.</p>
              <p>wells, where do you actually stand? ask yourself.</p>

              <p>hi,</p>
              <p>get your point. but please don't involve nurses and compare them with paramedics.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the TS is using the claims on the paramedic being in fault. TS is also hinding behind beside the Home, nurses, volunteers from fire.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>we should continue discussion on TS as a person. nothing to compare with nurses and paramedics.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>TS, as a person - failed.</p>
