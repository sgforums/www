              <p>Thanks for all your comments and opinions.</p>
              <p>To viciouskitty: I guess looking at your comments allow me to understand why such people in the world actually existed. Sorry I sounded mean, but looking at the situation, I don't think you all saw my point. I am not judging the paramedic's professionalism, it's his attitude.</p>

              <p><br>To TS,</p>
              <p>I have to be mean about this.  And I offer no apologies.  There is indeed different kind of people.  But your complaint about his attitude, also showed a lacking of your own attitude.</p>
              <p>And technically, you have put yourself up for judgment because of your own posting.</p>
              <p>You are ignorant.  That is the best I can be mean to tell you about.</p>
              <p>I do not expect you to really understand.  But then, we can leave it as, we agree to disagree about how you see things, and how others sees you and your staff at the welfare organisation.</p>
              <p>Frankly, lots of us worked or volunteered at welfare or volunteer organisation.  And the common complaints is about people who are ignorant, and yet whine, complain or judge other people on their attitude and professionalism.</p>

Calm down and do some breathing exercise. you will find that you are being very rude. Imagine you are the paramedic rushing down on an ambulance, and you are greeted by, "what took you so long!!?" as if it is your fault being late and you are not being welcome here. </span></p>
              <p>I thought the nurses in the homes are CPR trained and they should also know how to do abdominal thrust for choking patient.</p>
              <p>I am paramedic level II certified so I think you should be more polite. And if you tell me he is choking, should not you bring out to where the ambulance suppose to land for easy access. And it is very easy to distinguish choking patient. Vital signs are for unconscious patient. </p>
              <p>If the person can talk, he is surely breathing, heart pumping, meaning he is ok. He is not injured, not bleeding, conscious.... </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway you should try to ask the patient to bend forward and cough out the choking item. Else, you should do abdominal thrust.</p>
              <p>Ask the patient to stand shoulder wide apart, bent forward, move behind him, put your thumb in and position the fist  at the navel, ask the patient to cough and at the same time, use force and upward thrust the patient. Thrust him several times until he cough out the choking item... </p>

              <p>1. Wasn't the person already revived before the paramedics came?
              Why is <strong><em>Jactanic being attacked for CPR techniques...
              I'm assuming some form of resuscitation was
              performed?</em></strong></p>

              <p> 2. *patient is blue and on the floor, unconscious*</p>
              <p>Jactanic: Eh, can bend forward? Cough a bit? Wait ah, I carry
              you and give you ABDOMINAL THRUST!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. Hard to watch more than one person eat every second. The
              staff may be excellent at their jobs, but people still choke.</p>
              <p>4. 15 minutes is not fast. If I'm not wrong, emergency
              ambulances have a time limit of 12 minutes (or less)?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Thanks for all your comments and opinions.</p>
              <p>To viciouskitty: I guess looking at your comments allow me to
                          understand why such people in the world actually existed. Sorry I
                          sounded mean, but looking at the situation, I don't think you all
                          saw my point. I am not judging the paramedic's professionalism,
                          it's his attitude.</p>
              <p>If you all think that being stressed and all can make a person
                          to be doublely rude, then I have got nothing more to say. Just make
                          sure if something really happened to your family, you wouldn't
                          raised your voice at the paramedics who rushed here. Or even better
                          go send your dying family members or friends with a taxi. (One
                          thing to note, we only raised our voice at him out of anxiousness
                          and only once, he's the one who replied multiple rude remarks) I
                          understand you all are not there, hence, you don't understand the
                          situation, I don't blame you for doubting any professionalism of
                          ours. We did save the resident on our part.</p>
              <p>It's no longer about taking his remarks personally, it's about
                          all of your remarks now. I am just replying to all your
                          comments.</p>
              <p>I understand that if this carries on, I will only see more of
                          the ugly side human race, now I know how you people treated a human
                          life who is in danger.</p>

              <p>I'm not a paramedic; I'm an SAF combat medic. I've done a couple of ambulance duties with the SCDF, and let me just say this: paramedics are heroes, but in the end, they are still human.</p>
              <p>I am saying that you should not just try to see it from your own perspective, but from the paramedic's perspective as well. For all you know, he may have been attending to a particularly gruesome road traffic accident just an hour before where some motorist's brain matter got blown out. Then, just as he got back to the fire station, the alarm rings. Then his ambulance tries to reach your location by the fastest way possible but got held up in traffic. Then upon arrival, he gets shouted at for being slow.</p>
              <p>Pretty nice way to press someone's tension buttons, right?</p>
              <p>I am not saying that the paramedic did no wrong. What I am saying is that he committed an error that was <em>human</em>. There's only so much tension that one person can take before he loses it</p>
              <p>Personally I've been shouted at and verbally abused and threatened while trying to save multiple life-threatening heat casualties in the jungle. Words cannot describe the ultra-tense situation I was in, and all I can say is that I don't ever wish for that to happen again. And if you want to know, the only thing that stopped me from shouting like that paramedic was the knowledge that I'd get my butt tossed in the brig for yelling at senior officers.</p>
              <p>So if you want to complain to SCDF or something, then by all means, go and do so.</p>
              <p>All I'm saying is that before doing so, you should try to put things in perspective and to bear in mind that we are all only human. And that includes both the paramedic <em>and </em>the staff member who was rude to him.</p>

              <p>Shouldn't he had attended to the resident first instead of

              <p> </p>
              <p>So the paramedic has to take your staff's inconsiderate crap...be beaten or insulted by your idiotic staff.</p>
              <p>If your staff really cared about the resident's life, why did they say something potentially explosive?? Even if they did arrive late, tou all should be clearing the path and leading the paramedics to the location and not finger pointing at people accusing them of being late!</p>
              <p>If you are really certified first aider then you've really failed. The most important point for a first aider is always to remain clam regardless of the circumstances. This is to ensure you dont make the wrong diagnosis or decisions. I will be more afraid if i see a medic acting like a kan cheong spider when he arrives.</p>
              <p>BTW, i am paramedic trained myself. It is pointless continuing this thread because the thought that you are also at wrong has never crossed your mind. Its the whole world doing you wrong.</p>

              <p>I am ex-SCDF Amb Crew and i still think SCDF does a very good job. The paramedic that was "Rude" to you is only human....I'm sure workers like you working in homes have fair share in getting angry over comments by patient's famliy at times and you will 'talk' back to them saying you have done what you are suppose to do? It's human nature to get angry.....I'm not hitting at you wrkers at welfare homes, i staute you workers too for keeping old folks happy and well being at homes...so, try and think for the ambulance crew at times too..... <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Maybe because I did not state that, our staff had already opened the main door, and there are at least 3 staff there waiting for the paramedics, and to lead the way to the resident.</p>
              <p><strong>I am NOT trying to push blame here, and by the way, I admitted in earlier posts that my staff was at fault initially.</strong> The reason I posted here is not asking everyone single one of you to side us or to side the paramedic. I am just posting here to let people know that there is this kind of paramedic who is rude and has no sense of urgency when he reached.</p>
              <p>My point here is, he can do his job first before quarrelling with the staff.  He can do so after he saw the resident and ensure that the resident is fine.</p>
              <p>I agree that it's human error. I totally agree that it takes two hands to clap. It's my staff fault at first, but don't you think the paramedic reaction was doublely rude? Plus, he took his own sweet time despite there is already another staff there waiting to lead the way, the staff rushed ahead, expecting the paramedic to follow, when the staff turned around, no sight of paramedic. If you call this professionalism, I got nothing to say.</p>
              <p>By the way, from the beginning the topic was not about we thinking that the ambulance was late.</p>
              <p>To viciouskitty: You questioned my attitude of talking about that paramedic's attitude, what about yours? Your attitude wasn't any better. I didn't posted this to want anyone to take any sides.</p>
              <p>To giggs011: I never posted without thinking that the whole world has done me wrong, I didn't expected you to be taking any sides anyway. I didn't want that paramedic to be kan cheong spider , but at least has some sense of urgency. </p>
              <p>So you mean my resident should die due to the failed anger management of both staff and paramedic? It's just one remark and it incurred wrath?</p>
              <p>I know that a choked person will die within 3-10mins. So no point for an ambulance to come, so what then? I should just call for a hearse? Talking about anger management, the paramedic maybe stressed and upset over something that had happened earlier, but the staff who attended just saw that resident who is near death. One anxious plus scared, one stressed. Both clashed. But think about this, when you anxious, won't you raise your voice slightly?  I know staff was wrong to question about the arrival time, but when you are worried, won't you feel that the time is extremely long?</p>
              <p>I am NOT saying that the ambulance is wrong to arrive at that time, and I am Not saying that the paramedic is wrong to rant back at the staff. What I am saying is, he should at least go save a life first before ranting. <strong>If he had ranted yet walked faster to save the resident, then I would not have posted this at all.</strong>  Maybe it's my language skills which is not good, as many of you had misunderstood my point, for this I apologise.</p>

              <p>My attitude might need changing, but at the very least, I do not need two pages on this forum to tell me what is wrong now is not with me.  Its YOU!</p>
              <p>Walking faster to save a revived choked removed resident's life?</p>
              <p>Why not suggest that your organisation moved all your residents into a hospital to be nearer all qaulified nurses and doctors &amp; medical equipments and cut out any need for nurses, administrators, cleaners and yourself or even travelling  paramedics to save any person's life within that 3 minute crucial time?</p>
              <p>Geez......its like trying to tell us, that paramedic is known miracle healer that their touch on the pulse of any person, be it alive and dead will heal or revive the person immediately!  And if that happens.  Why do we need welfare staff that does better at typing their ignorance and attitude on forums when they should be better deployed to train themself as paramedics and miracle healers?</p>

              <p>1) Welfare home.  Resident choking.  One caregiver to probably 10 residents so thus result in one choking incident.</p>
              <p>2) At least two caregiver hopefully noticed the choking and rendered first aid.</p>
              <p>3) One other caregiver probably is the one that called for ambulance, not knowing that its either a choking incident or probably stroke or other life threatening attack on the resident.</p>
              <p>4) Three caregivers or staff opened front entrance big big and wait for paramedics to arrive.  (to point finger to direction of so called choking resident?  Or to help the paramedics carry in the ambulance where the ambulance cannot reach?)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5) One caregiver uttered rude question to paramedics.  Is that caregiver one of those that rendered first aid, or the one that make the phone call, or the one that was holding the hands of the choked and rendered first aid resident and giving comfort?</p>
              <p>6) What is the TS role and position in this incident?</p>
              <p>7) What happened to the other residents.  They all stand aside and continue living happily?</p>

              before knowing whether resident is fine, he walked really slowly to
              the scene. Together with his rude attitude, that's why I posted
              this online. So all you mean that, if you stressed, hungry, busy,
              you can be rude too? You mean we are not even allowed to question
              anything? It was just a remark "What took you so long?" If you are
              anxious, will you raised your voice too? if it's your family's
              life in danger, what will you do? It's his no sense of urgency that
              pissed us off..not only that attitude.</p>
              <p>Shouldn't he had attended to the resident first instead of

              You dont expect others to be rude no matter "if you are stressed, hungry, busy etc etc"
              
              So you can be rude and raise your voice when you are anxious. Nice.

              <p>Maybe because I did not state that, our staff had already opened
              the main door, and there are at least 3 staff there waiting for the
              paramedics, and to lead the way to the resident.</p>
              <p><strong>I am NOT trying to push blame here, and by the way, I
              admitted in earlier posts that my staff was at fault
              initially.</strong> The reason I posted here is not asking everyone
              single one of you to side us or to side the paramedic. I am just
              posting here to let people know that there is this kind of
              paramedic who is rude and has no sense of urgency when he
              reached.</p>
              <p>My point here is, he can do his job first before quarrelling
              with the staff.  He can do so after he saw the resident
              and ensure that the resident is fine.</p>
              <p>I agree that it's human error. I totally agree that it takes two
              hands to clap. It's my staff fault at first, but don't you think
              the paramedic reaction was doublely rude? Plus, he took his own
              sweet time despite there is already another staff there
              waiting to lead the way, the staff rushed ahead, expecting the
              paramedic to follow, when the staff turned around, no sight of
              paramedic. If you call this professionalism, I got nothing to
              say.</p>
              <p>By the way, from the beginning the topic was not about we
              thinking that the ambulance was late.</p>
              <p>To viciouskitty: You questioned my attitude of talking about
              that paramedic's attitude, what about yours? Your attitude
              wasn't any better. I didn't posted this to want anyone to take any
              sides.</p>
              <p>To giggs011: I never posted without thinking that the whole
              world has done me wrong, I didn't expected you to be taking any
              sides anyway. I didn't want that paramedic to be kan cheong
              spider , but at least has some sense of urgency. </p>
              <p>So you mean my resident should die due to the failed anger
              management of both staff and paramedic? It's just one remark and it
              incurred wrath?</p>
              <p>I know that a choked person will die within 3-10mins. So no
              point for an ambulance to come, so what then? I should just
              call for a hearse? Talking about anger management, the
              paramedic maybe stressed and upset over something that had happened
              earlier, but the staff who attended just saw that resident who
              is near death. One anxious plus scared, one stressed. Both clashed.
              But think about this, when you anxious, won't you raise your voice
              slightly?  I know staff was wrong to question about the
              arrival time, but when you are worried, won't you feel that the
              time is extremely long?</p>
              <p>I am NOT saying that the ambulance is wrong to arrive at that
              time, and I am Not saying that the paramedic is wrong to rant
              back at the staff. What I am saying is, he should at least go save
              a life first before ranting. <strong>If he had ranted yet walked
              faster to save the resident, then I would not have posted this at
              all.</strong>  Maybe it's my language skills which is not
              good, as many of you had misunderstood my point, for this I
              apologise.</p>

              <p>Sigh..... once again, everything I said still applies....</p>
              <p>I am really not on anyone's side; I am just trying to see both sides of the coin. For all you know the paramedic was already very tired and stressed out from having to literally rush from emergency to emergency with no real rest. And do you know how heavy and bulky the stretcher/ paramedic bag / all the other equipment are?</p>
              <p>I know I'm speculating, but at times like this, you might as well give the benefit of the doubt.</p>
              <p>Say what you will, but the human factor still applies. You want to say that the paramedic should have waited to rant, but it still takes a lot of effort to hold back all that when someone has pushed his buttons hard. You don't know what the paramedic had been through prior to taking your case, so I suggest just giving him the benefit of the doubt.</p>
              <p>The bottom line is, all this would not have happened had your staff thought about all this from a rational viewpoint and not done a number on him. Sure, the paramedic was wrong to blow up in that way, but that was because he was ignited and not because he self-combusted. I'm not saying that your staff had no right to be tense, but like it or not, his/her rude outburst was the trigger for all this.</p>
              <p>And really, by posting in this forum.... what do you aim to do, actually? If you really want an investigation to be conducted on the paramedic's conduct, then you should be going to the SCDF on this. How is what you're doing right now any more professional, really? </p>
              <p>This is my last post on this thread. I'm outta here.</p>
