              <p><span class="style12"><span class="style27"><span class="style27"><span class="style45"><span class="style70"><span class="style135">1. Some things are important, but most things are only necessary. <br> <br> 2. Necessary things are only important when you do not have them and are 
              	generally ignored when they are amply supplied. These include oxygen, food, 
              	drink. shelter, and all physical needs. <br> <br> 3. Important things are important all the time whether you have them or not, 
              	whether you realize it or not. <br> <br> 4. People who regard necessary things as important are unhappy and 
              	frustrated even when they get them and even if they are quite unaware that 
              	the important things exist. <br> <br> 5. Important things are those which can be made ends in themselves, worth 
              	seeking and worth having. Necessary things, since they are not important for 
              	their own sakes, should never made ends in themselves, but must be permitted 
              	only to be means to important ends. Thus, material wealth, power, 
              	popularity, and prestige should never be ends but only means to ends, 
              	because however necessary they may be they are never important. <br> <br> 6. THE ONLY THING WHICH IS IMPORTANT IS TRUTH
              	-- that is the total structure of reality. The meaning of anything arises 
              	from its relationship to that total structure. The reason that material 
              	things are not important is because of the subordinate position they hold in 
              	that total structure. <br> <br> 7. From this point of view, important things may exist on any level of 
              	reality. For example, physical health, exercise. and coordination are 
              	important on the physical level, but are not as important as things on 
              	higher levels, even though they can be made ends in themselves. <br> <br> 8. On the higher levels are such things as feelings. and intellectual 
              	awareness. <br> <br> 9. The important things are those concerned with the realization of the 
              	potentialities of an individual because such realization brings the 
              	individual in closer contact with the total structure of reality -- that is, 
              	with TRUTH. <br> <br> 10. Each individual is so inadequate that there are only a few things he can 
              	do to help realize his potentialities. Among these few are will - the desire 
              	to do this and the determination to do it. <br> <br> 11. Because of the inadequacy of the individual -- that is, his basic need 
              	for other persons and his inability to direct his efforts unless he has 
              	recognition of his relationships with the rest of reality, the individual 
              	can achieve nothing by seeking to obtain things for himself,
              	because this makes him the center of the universe, which he is not. Thus, 
              	selfishness achieves nothing.<br> <br> 12. Thus the chief immediate aim in life of each individual must be to help 
              	others realize their potentialities. This is what Kant meant when he said 
              	that others must never be treated as means to be used, but always as ends in 
              	themselves. It is basic in human experience that those things a person seeks 
              	for himself directly are never obtained. They are only obtained indirectly 
              	as a by-product of an effort to obtain them for others. Thus the man who 
              	seeks only wealth for himself never feels rich, as the man who seeks power 
              	never feels secure, and the man who seeks pleasure never feels satisfied. 
              	But the man who seeks important things for others often feels rich, secure, 
              	and satisfied. <br> <br> 13. The need for others is present on all levels, the physical. emotional, 
              	and intellectual. Indeed, every relationship has in it all three aspects. 
              	The desire to help others experience these things and to grow as a result of 
              	such experiences is called love. Such love is the real motivating force of 
              	the universe and is, in its ultimate nature. a manifestation of the love of 
              	God. Because while God is pure Reason and man' s ultimate goal is Reason, it 
              	can not be reached directly and must always be approached step by step, not 
              	alone but in companionship with others, and thus through love. Thus love of 
              	others, ultimately love of God, are the steps by which man develops reason 
              	and slowly approaches pure Reason.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
