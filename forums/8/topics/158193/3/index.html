            <div class='col-md body'>The behaviours I hate most!!<br><br>1) In restaurant I am enjoying my food.... the table next to me the parents change a SOILED diaper of their kids. It is not urine soil but faeces. After they change finished, they leave the soiled diaper on the table and left.  Since when our wait staff are also crap collectors?<br><br>2) Parents who let their kids cry and cry and they think "ignorning" them is a way to show them cryign doesn't work on them. But it sure served the purpose of irriating people around them.<br><br>3) Parents letting their kids to pee freely. Eg. on the grass turf just off the walking paths, into garden/fountain pools, corners of car parks, empty parking lots.<br><br>4) Smelly people in places who don't expect people to smell. Eg, a restaurant eating then someone walked past. S/he smell as if s/he just finished a gym session and never bathe OR wearing the same clothes for days.<br><br>5) Drivers who are making me think they somehow managed to skip BTT, ATT.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I hate the most is that "Me first!" attitude.<br><br>Really SUCKS!<br><br>You know what I do when someone wants to jump Q? I let him or her take my place, then I tap the person in front on the shoulder and say loud and clearly;"Ay, he/she wants to go first..." And of course, the resulting response will end the Q-jumper's impulse to jump Q!<br><br>Driving also the same; exiting into expressway, the slip road entering expressway will usually merge from two lanes to one - I'd slow down suddenly allowing the car behind trying to overtake and squeeze pass end up in front of me but stuck behind a line of vehicles, or, let him/her pass so quickly they end up squeezed to road shoulder by large heavy vehicle in front filtering out.<br><br>I mean these motorists are so STUPID! You get pass me on a verging slip road, how in heck are you going to find space after me??<br><br>There was once a car cut pass me only to end up jamming brakes because he/she ran out of space to squeeze.
