This is serious!  Honestly, what he did is enough for a molestation charge!  What he did is totally without your consent.  YOu  should be getting seriously <span style="color: red;"><strong>ANGRY </strong></span>at him.  <span style="color: red;">WHAT HE IS DOING IS CRIMINAL</span>.<br><br><strong>Please tell someone, call your Uni and talk to the welfare officer or some student liason officer.  Tell that person what is going on!  AT least that way, someone else closer to you knows what is happening!  Also they can check on you and intervene and possibly put this guy on warning!!! So that he will not dare do anything to you. </strong> Also they can black mark that guy and not recommend any student stay at his place in the future.<br><br><strong>You need to be ANGRY you need to SHOUT and SCREAM at him the next time he shows up</strong>.  Get as many friends as you can trust to come to your apartment.  When he comes round today, you YELL at him and say WHY DID YOU TOUCH ME yesterday? He will deny and start sweating!  You want him to sweat and he will become less daring!<br><br>You need to take CONTROL of the situation.  Otherwise he will.  He is trying to gain control by his actions.  So you need to be in control. You need to control him by using shame and anger and everything else to balance what he thinks is an imbalance of power! <span style="color: red;"><strong>He wants to manipulate and control you by causing you to be afraid!  The more afriad you are the more power he thinks he has!!!</strong></span><br><br>GIRL you really NEED TO BE ANGRY.  You are a victim and you have every right to feel violated.  Why should you have to put up with the inconvenience just bec this idiot cannot control his hormones?  Why should you suffer??<br><br>A victim will sometimes feel like they are the one who is at fault.  NO! NO! NO!<br><br>Fight for your right to be left alone.  Fight for YOUR RIGHTS to be safe!  Be Angry and that will give you the energy to protect yourself!<br><br>Please please tell someone who is near where you live and in your Uni what is going on immediately!  Please Do this immediately not just on SGforum.<br><br>Keep us posted!  Be Safe ya!</div>

This is serious!  Honestly, what he did is enough for a molestation charge!  What he did is totally without your consent.  YOu  should be getting seriously <span style="color: red;">[b]ANGRY </span></strong>at him.  <span style="color: red;">WHAT HE IS DOING IS CRIMINAL</span>.<br><br><strong>Please tell someone, call your Uni and talk to the welfare officer or some student liason officer.  Tell that person what is going on!  AT least that way, someone else closer to you knows what is happening!  Also they can check on you and intervene and possibly put this guy on warning!!! So that he will not dare do anything to you. </strong> Also they can black mark that guy and not recommend any student stay at his place in the future.<br><br><strong>You need to be ANGRY you need to SHOUT and SCREAM at him the next time he shows up</strong>.  Get as many friends as you can trust to come to your apartment.  When he comes round today, you YELL at him and say WHY DID YOU TOUCH ME yesterday? He will deny and start sweating!  You want him to sweat and he will become less daring!<br><br>You need to take CONTROL of the situation.  Otherwise he will.  He is trying to gain control by his actions.  So you need to be in control. You need to control him by using shame and anger and everything else to balance what he thinks is an imbalance of power! <span style="color: red;"><strong>He wants to manipulate and control you by causing you to be afraid!  The more afriad you are the more power he thinks he has!!!</strong></span><br><br>GIRL you really NEED TO BE ANGRY.  You are a victim and you have every right to feel violated.  Why should you have to put up with the inconvenience just bec this idiot cannot control his hormones?  Why should you suffer??<br><br>A victim will sometimes feel like they are the one who is at fault.  NO! NO! NO!<br><br>Fight for your right to be left alone.  Fight for YOUR RIGHTS to be safe!  Be Angry and that will give you the energy to protect yourself!<br><br>Please please tell someone who is near where you live and in your Uni what is going on immediately!  Please Do this immediately not just on SGforum.<br><br>Keep us posted!  Be Safe ya![/b]</blockquote>clap clap clap clap clap</div>
