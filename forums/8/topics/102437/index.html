            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>Reading all these complaint letters about SG men seeking Viet Brides made me laugh. Like domestic firms who complain they cannot compete with imports, these SG ladies are crying for trade restrictions in the disguise of legal protection for foreign ladies.<br><br>Don't they understand this is the same complaint local Singaporeans make about "losing jobs to FTs"? Is it no wonder that all 3 letters are written by SG ladies?<br><br>http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/sub/forum/story/0,5562,280593,00.html?<br>===========================================<br><br>Oct 22, 2004<br>Invalid font BUY-A-BRIDE<br>Picking a spouse easier than hiring a maid<br>I CAN'T help but feel that the Vietnamese women married to Singaporean men after 'whirlwind courtships' may not be much better off than the foreign maids working here.<br><br>In some instances, some of them may even suffer a worse plight if they are abused by their husbands.<br><br>There are many parallels. Both brides and maids are at best equipped with a rudimentary knowledge of the languages and culture here and, forced by circumstances, are plucked in a matter of weeks to settle in a foreign country, with nary kith or kin.<br><br>I find it ironic that Singaporeans generally take more time and effort to find the 'perfect' maid for their households than these men who decide on their 'true love' after a few hours.<br><br>I hazard to say that most, if not all, of these marriages are more akin to a dominant employer-maid relationship than one based on an equal partnership.<br><br>This is evidenced by the men saying that they wanted 'obedient' wives and that they were like kings in Vietnam. The wives are, at least in the beginning, isolated from the community and totally dependent on their husbands.<br><br>With such power tilted in favour of the husband, I wonder how these wives are faring here. Are there any statistics to show the incidence of abuse of these foreign wives by their Singaporean husbands?<br><br>Judging by the number of abused and 'unsatisfactory' maids rejected by employers here, is it too far-fetched to extrapolate these figures to the foreign wives?<br><br>It is also ironic that first-time employers of maids now have to go for a briefing at the Ministry of Manpower whereas Singaporean men can just select a foreign wife without being aware of the potential ramifications.<br><br>There may be many such wives suffering silently here, unable or unwilling to seek help. In some cases, they may be worse off than the abused maids here. Maids have at least been apprised of certain avenues to seek help if they are abused. How about these wives?<br><br>I doubt the agencies arranging these match-making sessions supply these women with much information on where to seek help should the need arise. Even if they are aware of such help, they may have too much at stake to report abuses, unlike maids who probably have no qualms exposing their errant employers.<br><br>As more Singaporean men take such foreign wives, will the potential problems balloon, as with the foreign maids here?<br><br>Like the maids, I believe we owe these foreign wives some degree of protection and legal recourse should things go wrong.<br><br>Maria Loh Mun Foong (Ms)<br></div>
