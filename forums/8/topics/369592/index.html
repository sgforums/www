              I've been to a coupla outings. Nope, I don't feel awkward. Maybe coz I take it just as that - an outing to meet people. And yeah I do have other circles of friends apart from those here - different groups for different interests eg sports, running, schoolmates, colleagues etc. 
              
              Just take these outings at face value.

              <p>hmm.. u go out outings , u meet people, u become friends so the outing is a place where u meet other friends. for me, i'm not ashamed to say that i met my friends through forum because i think that it's nothing wrong with going to forum and all.  so it boils down to your perspective n your thinking. </p>

              <p>Its even more pathetic, that you hang out with forum people.</p>
              <p>Really because you got no other friends!</p>
              <p>Not even school mates?  Not even prison mates?</p>
              <p>I have one guy, who keep telling me, that I am one of his only 2 friends and thats why he was always pestering me about where is my location and what is it I am doing at any given moment.  Machiam like everytime he asked me, I will be replying him that I am having sex with whatever unknown fella and will give him blow by blow account of that event!</p>
              <p>If he truly no friends......how the heck he got a wife and a daughter now?</p>

              <p>My answer - No. Going to a school to make friends, getting to know your colleagues well and to becoming friends are just two ways of knowing friends.</p>
              <p>So is joining a forum outing. If all hit well, can go out together more often privately, not through forum outings. I don't see any problems with that.</p>
              <p>Embarrassing - it's not. Unless you count identifying the wrong person. But even that can turn out well. Had one outing that a wrong person was identified and ended up joining the outing. Had a fun time together and still keep occassional contact and meet up occassionally.</p>
              <p>Awkward - only the silence is.</p>

              <p>quote for best answer so far. u really turn my view. well come to think of it, it is better than making friends here and go out on a forum outing rather than just sitting here. Since majority of u guys said that this is ok and nothing to be embarrasse about then i think its fine too.</p>
              <p>Just hopefully my friend didnt know im hanging out with peoples from forum, u know</p>
