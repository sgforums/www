              <p>I see I have a stalker. I don't give a shit to be honest. I only care about the integrity of this forums as a whole. People come home, want to read and reply about topics and subjects, threads do not need to be filled with utter bullshit unrelated to the matter.</p>
              <p>You guys want to fight in public, online somemore, by all means, knock yourselves out. Just remember, as it is public, people will get involved. If posting in any thread means being a busybody, I guess everyone in SgForums should be classified as such? Since you have to be 'nosey' and curious to find out what the thread's all about what, right anot? Might as well don't post in the first place. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>By-stander also want to turn into another enemy, I really have nothing to say. Go ahead and rant all you want.</p>
              <p>Word of advice, stop trying to act all victimized and get people involved to 'sympathize' you like you're doing in SB and in the thread.</p>
              <p>Since I'm such a 'busybody', I'm not going to bother replying you. Have fun, and again, good luck.</p>

              <p>The general rule about going out with friends from the forums.</p>
              <p>1) Let everyone knows where you are going, roughly who you are going out with and try to bring along a few friends too......helps to build up the network circle.</p>
              <p>2) Even if you are friendly or helpful enough to another forumer, dont be surprise they will turn around and try to bite your hands off after you offer a hand for friendship or whatever tidbits.</p>
              <p>3) In the event that they bite you or try to bit you or attempts to scare and harrass you to succumb to their threats.  Take note that there is always a higher power to make sure they can be put down or have their teeth permanently extracted.  Its only a matter of learning to be cool, calm and collected and making sure that when you kick and bite back, those fellas who pride themselves as jokers that can get away with anything will be getting away with their tails stuck between their legs.</p>
              <p>4) Enjoy the outings, enjoy the company, enjoy putting a fresh face to others which your old friends or companions dislike about you.  But take note that if you choose to different from your usual self.  Stick to that notion 101 percent and make sure your mind is open.</p>
              <p>Open mind does not mean opening yourself to sexual harrassment or abuse by those fellas who thinks you should deserve it.</p>
              <p>A nice sharp stick, sticking into their open mind or a open zipper will be good enough.</p>

              <p>And fanta,  I agree with keii in some sense that this is overdoing things.</p>
              <p>If things needed to be dealt with, then lets deal with it face to face instead of screaming at each other online.</p>
              <p>You already know what went wrong with whoever you are now feuding with.</p>
              <p>And since they arent as faceless from the forum.  Deal with them face to face, is always better then making such feeble attempts on this forum making a nuisance of yourself.</p>
              <p>Heck, I made enough nuisance myself.  But when push come to shove.  Look at how often those that are feuding with me, are only able to scream at me using the forum, instead of daring to face me.</p>
