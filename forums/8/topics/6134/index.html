            <div class='col-md body'>the opposite of love is apathy...as mayajade has said....when you just don't give a dman anymore...hate is it's own emotion..hate is passion and emotion...love is passions and emotion...too similar to be opposites..<br><br>Apathy is when you just really can't even feel a single thign at all towards a person or thing.....the ultimate opposite because love is the ultimate feeling for something or someone.<br><br>adn dunfortunately many people are guilty of apathy.....<br><br>hate is really just love gone sour.  Hate is love in the form of misunderstandign and ignorance and rejection, and indignity...<br><br>It is all the thing you could not or were not able to achieve thru or with love....it is a very strong emotion that can just as easily tuirn into love....<br><br>That is why you see people who hate each other fallign in love...and if they eventually hate each other it means that they have feeelings towards that eprson still but can't get beyond the trash that was created by the misunderstanding or whatever else ther is....<br><br>the worst is to love someone then all of a sudden feel absolutely nothing for the,mm..no concern, no love, no respect...u just dun even iknow they exist enuff for you to take notice...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmmmmm......interesting question...<br><br>Asure: Look at what's under my nick! hiak hiak hiak~<br><br>anways...back on the subject...I think hate is like what fire said...it's love that became sour, without love i don't think there can be hate.  It takes a lot to hate someone, you can't just envy a guy over a car and stay you hate him rt?!  I think that is more like being envy, not hate.  You can't just hate someone out of the blue! If you dislike someone you won't even care if he/she is alive or not, but if you hate someone you will pay more attention to that person, and whatever he/she does will matter to you.<br><br>Asure:<br>I understand what you are trying to say there, think we had this conversation before rt?! kinda blur, but i know have have discussed it w/ someone over the net, and might be you, since you always so chim.. =P<br><br>Cluon:<br>maybe you have mistaken hate w/ envy or dislike?<br><br>Personally, I don't think I have ever hated someone in my life...dislike yes, but not hate.  Takes too much for me to hate someone and i think that I will also get hurt by hating someone...There's too much hating arnd anyways...don't wanna include myself =P the sad thing is that people hate one another for stupid reasons...<br><br>[This message has been edited by NaiveGirl (edited 11 February 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hate and love.... extreme feelings they are.<br><br>They are similiar yet different. Let me explain, it is the source or shall I say motivation that is the same, but the effects that are different well, at least most of the time.<br><br>Love originates from you, it's motivation is an object or a person of desire. When you are in love, your actions are guided and driven by emotions, it does not really make sense and sometimes even defy logic.<br><br>Hate originates from you too, it's motivation is an object or a person of detest. When you are in hate, your actions are guided and driven by emotions again, it does not really make sense and sometimes even defy logic too.<br><br>The above are similiarities. But what are the difference? The effect of love and hate are on two different specturms. Love makes you care, makes you sensitive, and overall good feeling is infuse in you, you long to see the person you love, you are happy just to see him/her, it brightens up your day. Hate makes you disregard the person, makes you irritated by him, and overall feeling of disgust is infuse in you, you dun want to see the person you hate, you are irritated just to see him/her, it darkens your day.<br><br>But of course there are effects that are the same too. Both love and hate could motivate, it could motivate a person to perform in extreme circumstances, it could drive the person to prove himself, and these are the positive effects of both love and hate. It could also cause a person to lose hope, cause him/her to sacrifices/kill himself/herself because of that person. Negative aspects of it's effect are the above.<br><br>Ultimately they are both emotions, and it is a matter of perspective, of how you can use them to your advantage.<br><br>------------------<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Just my $0.02 worth</span></strong></div>
