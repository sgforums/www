But think again, is that the kind of government that you want?? The kind of government that let people suffer just because they dont vote for them?<br>Government is supposed to service for the country and her people, not to make them suffer! They might as well declare Singapore being an Empire, in this way they dont have to waste their time letting the people vote since they die die also want the people to vote for them .</div>
