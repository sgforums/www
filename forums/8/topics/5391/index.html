            <div class='col-md body'>Well I approached her feeling so nervous I thought i was going to faint, my hands felt cold!!<br>I introduced and ask if she would like to have coffee sometime and she answered something like maybe or where (I realli couldn't remember!! I was very nervous!) So I asked her how could I contact her, and she said she would contact me instead. I gave her my number and tried to ask for hers again but she refused.<br>Then we parted ways. I was happy but I really doubt whether she would actually call me. So what would be the next best course of action if she called/don't call??<br>Experts pls advice!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay, let me tell you one of my adventure - it's true even though it sounds like a tall tale.<br><br>I met this girl when I was travelling on a train. Well, the thing is she fell asleep and was like leaning on my shoulder. Frankly, I was kinda excited but then I didn't like take advantage, so, I just try and nudge her gently to try and wake her up. This happens a few times throughout the journey.<br><br>Finally, it was time for lunch but I was too afraid to make a move. After that, I was like thinking...hmmmm....how? And then I decided to offer her my newspaper (see, it pays to have newspaper or magazines around)She accepted it, and then we started to talk, get to know each other...<br><br>When we reach the station, we went separate ways. Before that, we exchange phone numbers.<br><br>And then after that I call her when I reach home and ask her out on a weekend. She rejected saying she needed to settle some personal stuffs. Okay, so I thought maybe I was too fast. So one week later, I tried again. This time, she said she has classes. Well, I was thinking better luck next time. I told her she can page me, but she didn't. So, after about 2 weeks I called her. This times she agreed, so naturally I was quite happy.<br><br>Just as I thought I have a chance, she called up last minute and told me that she got something on with her friends and really sorry that she cannot make it. Anyway, I told her it's okay and she can call me if she's free.<br><br>I didn't call her again as I think if a girl rejects you 3 times, then it's like no chance. Anyway, she didn't call me either, so...<br><br>Well, that's the end. The moral of the story is, you have to persistent no matter what. Even if she rejects you, you have to try again. Of course, don't force her, just ask her nicely.<br><br>Don't let my experience dampen you. Like Lou Bega's Mambo no. 5 "....To me flirting is just like a sport..." And to attain healthy lifestyle, you gotta do sport, so...<br><br>If she rejects you, well, just move on and concentrate on other things in the mean time, like your work?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As a girl I would give my own opinion on this. Like firewire has said maybe she's not interested. The fact that when u asked her for a coffee and she said maybe. If the girl is really interested in you she would have said okay the moment u ask her with no doubts.<br>And if she wanted to meet u again she would have given her contact no. so that u can give her a call since u're the one who ask her out again and vice versa. When the girl says she will call u, dun hope on it 100%. She may still call u but dun get ur hopes high. I know coz I do the same thing. Luckily they only have my pager no. so I can avoid calling them as I wish. I have reasons in doing so but I wun elaborate on that.<br>But anyway Qwer, dun worry abt it. If u want to try talking to her again it's ok..but dun do it too often..she may think u are a stalker.<br><br>------------------<br>~If it's wrong to love you, then I dun wanna be right~<br><br>[This message has been edited by ^snowie^ (edited 14 November 1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Well...i dun wanna make u feel sad or sumting...but all this onli boils down to one fact...That the girl does not want anyting to do wif u...I'm not saying ur approach is bad...In fact it is good yet simple..However, when girls said the will call u..yet refuse to give their contact no..it means that they are not interested in u...not even as a friend..So basicalli...what i'm saying is the same as firewire...dun get ur hopes to high buddy...<br>GO find a better girl whu will appreciate you...Btw...u mite try to work on teh nervous part...IT mite interfer wif u meeting ur Mrs Right in the future,,<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry to hear what happened. Wait for the next time someone can motivate you enough to ask them out then.<br><br>Perhaps this time, when they say "maybe" when you ask if they would like to have coffee, you might want to specify a certain date. At least you have something concrete to go on.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess u have receive enough wet blankets.. SO I dun add my in. For me, I won't give up so fast. I do it slow and steady. Call her, talk to her as friends first. Take it easy.. No harm talking to her for a month or 2 without going out. During these period of time, try to test her out whether if she's attached. Don't ask her out for now. Just chatting will do.<br><br>My friends alwayz say this is so slow. I see that many of my friends alwayz ask her out within a week. I don't coz I know I will fail. I have accumulate enough experiences to say that. Probably they are handsome and I'm fat and ugly. So even if nothing develops out of it, as least I still got a friend. Unless you are not interested in having a platonic frendship.<br><br>It's just my personal experience.

            <div class='col-md body'>If I was the gal....I would be very wary of strangers asking me out for even such a harmless activity such as drinking coffee. I don't mean to sound like a wet blanket but most Singaporeans are pretty wary of strangers esp. gals. Unless the person means no harm (helping to carry heavy stuff.) and is only trying to help, then will they relax and be grateful. Many ppl may say that he/she is open to strangers befriending them, but deep down inside is still that inate mistrust. It takes willingness and time to overcome this. Although I have to admit that some gals do like to play hard to get, well....you win some and you lose some. There is no harm in trying to befriend strangers, so keep on trying and let time prove that you only wanted to be friends. Good Luck!!!!</div>
