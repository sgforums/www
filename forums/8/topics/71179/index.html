            <div class='col-md body'>Barry considers playing out of his league in his imaginary diary.<br><br>16 February 2004 (Monday) Â– Time to make important investment decisions. Instructed Soo Ker Liau, my foreign talent investment adviser, to convene a top-level meeting.<br><br>I entered the boardroom and saw that the senior investment managers from the Government Investment Corporation, Temasek, Monetary Authority and Central Provident Fund Board had turned up.<br><br>I told them they are not needed, but they can stick around and learn something. The real investment team entered the room: father, mother, wife, brother and sister. Soccer expert Marlboro Tan was also present as adviser. The family was told he is a soccer expert; he is credited with the state of domestic soccer. He was described as a real visionary, setting Vision 2010 for the national team. ThatÂ’s funny, mother muttered. Even though she is not a soccer fan, she distinctly remembered that it was previously known as Goal 2010. Did Marlboro Tan move the goalposts?<br><br>What football team to buy?<br><br>Sister wanted to buy the team that has Yao Min in it. How many World Series has that team won, she asked? The investment managers were too scared to correct her. Then the soccer guru Marlboro Tan opened his mouth: Â“Yao Min plays ice hockey for the Boston Red Sox, and they have won the most number of Super Bowls.Â” Trust Marlboro Tan to score an own goal.<br><br>Brother has got into the merger mindset from his time at SinkTel. He wanted to buy the French club Nice, the German club Cologne, and merge them. The merged club will be called Nice Cologne.<br><br>Dear wife also joined in the merger mania. Just like Singapore is too small to support four banks, hence leading to their mergers, <strong>London is too small to support so many football clubs. </strong>She will use her Temasek cheque book to <strong>buy up Arsenal, Tottenham and West Ham, merge them, and turn them into the biggest club in Europe. </strong>That is the way to survive against the big boys. The merged club will be <strong>called Temasek-WestHam-Arsenal-Tottenham, or TWAT for short. </strong>It will be a great investment, promising to beat the 18% return that Temasek has been boasting about. In time to come, the peasants will appreciate what a sizzling investment this will be, and this deal will enter the annals of urban legend: it will be fondly known as Ma'am HoÂ’s hot TWAT.<br><br>I knew which club I wanted to buy. <strong>Leeds United </strong>is in financial difficulties, and could be put into administration. And <strong>the team happens to wear my favourite colour: all white. </strong>I will be the white knight and rescue the club. It will then be renamed<strong> Lee United. </strong><br><br>Mother was, as usual, prudent. She was reluctant to splash dollops of money to buy one of those strong European team. Any team will do, as long as it wears her favourite colour: pink, and with polka dots preferably. Damn, that will be a difficult one. I leaned over and whispered to <strong>Marlboro Tan, who was caressing two balls, and said: Â“The national team looks good in pink polka dots.Â” Marlboro TanÂ’s balls dropped. Â“Yes! Yes!Â” was all he could say.</strong><br><br>Father only wanted to buy the best. And as usual, he will pay over the top for top foreign talent. Soo Ker Liau told him the <strong>best team in Europe is Real Madrid. WhatÂ’s more, they wear all white, and their players are paid million-dollar salaries. </strong>ThatÂ’s the team we want, father declared. But we will add a lightning logo onto the team jersey and rename the club Real Action Party he said.<br><br>Â© http://www.TalkingCock.com 2001-2003.
