            <div class='col-md body'>Also known as "Kanzen Naru Shiikai No 40 Nichi 2". This movie will shows from Thursday 07 August at Yangtze. Starring Rie Fukaumi.<br><br><span style="color: green;">From his office window, a Psychotherapist looks out at a mysterious young woman standing on a bridge and gazing at the water below. Resolving to introduce himself to her the therapist walks outside but finds that the girl has vanished. When he turns around the girl is suddenly beside him, she quietly asks him if he will go out with her. Then she asks him, "will you be my papa?"<br><br>Intrigued, the therapist invites the girl back to his office where she tells him that she is out looking for UFOs, something she often does. Convinced that she is repressing some memories the therapist decides to hypnotise the girl. We find out that she is Haruka Tsumura, a part time worker who left college last Spring and that she has an odd story to tell...<br><br>In flashback we see an 18 year old Haruka standing in some wasteground looking up at the sky at a mysterious balloon shaped UFO. Behind her we see a car pull up and a man stares at her before driving away. Later that evening Haruka, who spends her evenings alone as her mother works all hours, is drawn back to the place where she saw the UFO. Returning to the same spot she is confronted by the mysterious man in the car who had followed her earlier. The man abducts her at knifepoint and takes her back to his drab apartment.<br><br>Gagged and forced to strip Haruka is then quickly handcuffed while the man, Tatsuaka Sumikawa, takes a polaroid of her sitting on the bed. He attempts to rape Haruka but she struggles and kicks him away. Tatsuaka apologises profusely for his conduct, grabs a nearby table and starts writing some notes. He begins firing questions at Haruka, asking her name, date of birth, blood group and starsign. After this interrogation he then weighs her and writes her weight on the polaroid, which he then sticks on the wall beside the bed that Haruka is sitting on. Tatsuaka then informs Haruka that she will be staying with him and that if she tries anything he will kill her first then kill himself.<br><br>The next few days consist of Haruka simply eating, sleeping and struggling. By day when Tatsuaka is at work she can only lie on the bed, handcuffed and tied up. In the evenings she tries to convince Tatsuaka to let her go but Tatsuaka simply can't, telling her that he loves her. Their conversation is strained, broken only by Tatsuaka weighing Haruka and taking a polaroid shot of her to then stick to the wall.<br><br>However, it soon becomes clear that her life is not in any immediate danger and Haruka eventually begins to submit to Tatsuaka's more needy advances. Tatsuaka even buys her a dress and brings her her favourite foods. Around this time Tatsuaka asks Haruka to call him her 'papa.' Gradually, the relationship becomes more complex: the ramblings of the besotted Tatsuaka mixing strangely with the indifference of Haruka. As the relationship progresses from fear to a difficult understanding, the polaroids on the wall show the passage of time.<br><br>One night, while both are handcuffed to each other and lying in bed, the virginal Haruka (who now sleeps with Tatsuaka in his double bed) declares that she is ready to sleep with him. From that night on any sexual fears that she has are quickly removed and she is eager to experience what she can. On one of their rare trips outside, they even walk around and spy on courting couples.<br><br>One such trip out sees them return to the very spot where Haruka witnessed the UFO and also where Tatsuaka abducted her. Haruka, in typically doleful fashion, laments about the loneliness in the world. As they return to the apartment she suggests that their relationship cannot carry on as it is and that they should go away somewhere.<br><br>A day later, while driving back to the apartment, they notice the Police outside questioning a neighbour. Driving away quickly they are not sure where to go however Tatsuaka drives to a large house for sale. Unlocking the front door Tatsuaka informs Haruka that this is where he used to live with his mother.<br><br>Making the most of the solitude, they are nearly caught having sex when an estate agent shows a couple around the house. Luckily, this couple are more interested in one of the other properties and don't stay long but this is enough to unnerve Tatsuaka and Haruka and they also decide to drive away.<br><br>When Tatsuaka stops for an impromptu toilet trip at the side of the road, a Police car pulls up and the detectives get out and ask Haruka to confirm her name. Haruka turns to look at Tatsuaka walking back to the car and she tries to warn him by sounding the horn and willing him to run. Ignoring Haruka's cries to run, a smiling Tatsuaka casually strolls back towards the car.<br><br>Some time later in the hypnosis session Haruka informs the therapist that Tatsuaka was found dead a couple of years ago, apparently committing suicide by walking in front of a train. When the session draws to an end, the therapist tells Haruka that she may now start to recover from this episode.<br><br>However, we last see Haruka walking to the patch of wasteland again, looking for UFOs.</span><br><br><img src="http://www.bestsell.com/images/6/12244.3.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.bizarreingredients.co.uk/japan/z/perf2/per3.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.bizarreingredients.co.uk/japan/z/perf2/per2.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://uta.coco.co.jp/rie/mag/wpb010424-rief1.jpg">[/img]</div>
