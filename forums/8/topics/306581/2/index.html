              <p>Islam is a religious ideology that is very intolerant of non-Muslims. Now we have a school pricicpal in a secular school who is imposing a form of shariah law.</p>
              <p>Non-Muslims have to tell Muslims that they are not going to put up any more of the Muslim habits that is going to discriminate non-Muslims. If they want to be fussy about their food go to a madrassah school in Indonesia or Malaysia.</p>

              <p>Basically, i do not blame the principal nor the the assistant principal, who is also a muslim, the ideology and duty of a muslim is to spread the good religion as much as possible for the good and not for bad intention. His intention is deem good but not really appreciated nor tolerated by our multi cultural society.</p>

              <p>If you will to look at other schs here, such as catholic high, saint this and that, aren't nuns, teachers and even priests preaching and selling souls on christianity in those schools and yet the public made no sound out of it.</p>

              <p>So where do we stand.? I am not an advocate of any religion, but I have to respect all, and in respecting, i seek equality with all concern. The principal had apologised and reversed his decision, what about those schools preaching and even giving out religion books to student of buddhist or other religion parents, are they going to apologise???</p>

              <p>there's a difference between giving out religious books and enforcing a strict halal food policy. if you dun like, u can dun listen and throw the books away. But enforcing the halal food policy means there can't even bring their home-cooked lunchbox into school. u are forced to eat the food in the canteen, if not, then wait till you go home for lunch....</p>

              <p>Well, for such schools, be it Methodist, Catholic, Anglican, etc, MOE already given them the Green Light for religious classes and students who're not comfortable with it can opt out of these classes.</p>

              <p><br>Oh! so nuns and priests can be teachers there too ya. As a neutral student with a young naive mind, sooner or later will be opted in. That's is the way to reach out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fair enough, in another words, the principal of BL garden pri school can now apply for permit to start religious classes and to get imans and islamic teachers in too. And the those chinese one can get taoists and monks to be their teachers too. Fair?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Publish in newspaper does not mean it is supported, and our newspapers here is a monopolised news with no competition within a monopolised editing, there are many peoples with different views and opinons to it, it just that some just dun wish to comment and talk about it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In here, we have to justify the issue, yes, the principal should have consider all concern before executing his decision, or perhap separate between halal and non halal food section. On the other hands, given the green light for religion teaching in schools, he should have applied for the right to spread his intention rather than enforcing.</p>
