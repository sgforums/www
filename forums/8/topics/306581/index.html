              Today ST news talk about a Pri school Boon Lay having halal foodspace zone that no one able to bring non halal food into school canteen, but later overturn as a mistake...
              
              The school has 20% moslems,while one has no problems having all the foodstalls being halal but not able to bring non halal food in seems weird and unsingaporean, wonder what you guys think of this??

              <p>catknight seems to be anti-islam.and preaching christianity.seriously,go check his/her posts and topics. the one on pro-israel also have.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>seriously,just live ur own life and and be whatever you hope to be</strong>.people like you like <strong>wasting</strong> time on such issues and than fail in life than blame whatever that can be blamed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>why u never think of the fact than the canteen stalls none of the non-muslims want to rent it? open up for so long than since no takers they give it to the malays who been waiting for it very long lor. didnt think of this fact? just shows u are narrow minded and biased. if u take GP sure fail.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>stop finding opportunities to condemn muslims.seriously. there are bad ones there are good ones. in every religion sure got bad eggs.cmon.dont tell me christianity got no bad eggs?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>THE RULE OF THE BOOK IS RED MAN DONT CROSS. if ppl wanna cross,what can you do.ppl wanna defy God,what can you do. so stop making such topics catknight. how old are you? 12?</p>
