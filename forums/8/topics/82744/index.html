            <div class='col-md body'>Should I join Liverpool? I believe Benitez will be able to bring out the best in me. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br><blockquote><strong>Benitez undaunted by job at Liverpool</strong><br><br>Rafael Benitez insisted he was undaunted by the prospect of restoring Liverpool to the pinnacle of English football after being officially unveiled as the club's new manager on Wednesday.<br><br>The 44-year-old Spaniard has signed a five-year deal at Anfield after quitting Valencia whom he guided to a Spanish League and UEFA Cup double last season.<br><br>Benitez - who called his Anfield appointment a 'dream' - believes hard work and team-building is the key to overhauling Arsenal, Manchester United and Chelsea and regaining domestic glory.<br><br>But he will lose no sleep over the quality of those rivals on the back of his double title success in Spain.<br><br>Benitez said: 'I know it is a hard job because last season the difference between the top three and the others was not good.<br><br>'But Valencia was the same, we had Real Madrid and Barcelona at the top. You have got to change that mentality.<br><br>'If necessary I will change the mentality here. The most important thing is to be a team which means lots of hours working and talking with the players.'<br><br>Liverpool chief executive Rick Parry said he was convinced he had secured the best possible replacement for Gerard Houllier, who left the club last month.<br><br>Parry said: 'Rafael has an outstanding track record and two Spanish League titles in three years speaks for itself.<br><br>'What was important for us was his evident enthusiasm for the job. Rafael clearly wanted to come to Liverpool and that is why he was our number one target.<br><br>'He is not promising instant success but he has the track record and the appetite. He is young, enthusiastic and hungry for more success.'<br><br>Benitez' first task upon the conclusion of Euro 2004 will be to sit down with Liverpool's England stars whom he considers crucial to his rebuilding programme.<br><br>Steven Gerrard's future is already in doubt this summer but Liverpool believe the promise of silverware under Benitez can persuade him to stay.<br><br>Benitez himself is anxious to sit down and discuss the future with the squad's most established stars.<br><br>He added: 'It is very important that I talk to players like Gerrard and (Michael) Owen about my ideas.<br><br>'I need players like them with a good mentality and quality and they know all about what Liverpool means.<br><br>'I did not just come here to learn English but to win. I want players who have the same mentality and if they do not, it will not be possible.'<br><br>Benitez continued his emergence as one of the finest coaches in Europe by leading Valencia past Marseille to claim the UEFA Cup in Gothenburg last month.<br><br>It was an achievement made all the more remarkable by the modest beginnings to his managerial career.<br><br>He was sacked from his first coaching job at Valladolid in 1995 then lasted just nine games with Second Division Osasuna.<br><br>However, promotions with Extremadura and Tenerife rescued Benitez and marked him out as a coach to covet.<br><br>In 2001 he justified Valencia's faith by leading them to their first Spanish League title in 31 years in his first season in charge.<br><br>Benitez is not promising such instant success at Anfield. But he is aware of the expectation levels at a club which once took success and silverware for granted.<br><br>Benitez added: 'I know that Liverpool is one of the most important clubs in the world and its history is wonderful.<br><br>'I said the same thing when I arrived at Valencia and in my first year we won the league - but in the Premiership it is very different.<br><br>'It is bad to say we will do it in one year or two years but the right thing is to work hard and prepare for every match each day.'<br><br>Parry would not reveal the extent of Benitez's new budget but he is sure to have demanded funds to boost a team which largely disappointed last season despite scraping into the final Champions League places.<br><br>Reports from Spain have already linked Liverpool's new boss with a number of his former Valencia club-mates.<br><br>But Benitez was not mentioning any names today and insisted: 'I know how difficult this market is.<br><br>'If I have names on my mind I will talk to Rick Parry about them. It is not as easy as just signing five players from Valencia.<br><br>'It is important for me to sign the right players for our team.'</blockquote></div>
