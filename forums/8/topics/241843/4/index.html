I actually read through the whole thread and i did find lots of funny issues , things that dont match up<br><br>For example , you posted<br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Originally posted by SumOne:<br>4) Is it right of Devil to try take Bee_gal away from Alex and make her his own gf.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I wasn't even anywhere CLOSE to that kinda state as MR ALEX has claimed... REMEMBER?<br><br>He said his gf AVOIDED me...?<br>[This message was edited by Devil1976 on 2007-03-05 04:26:44.]<br><br>but before that you posted this<br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Originally posted by sunny6110:<br><br>where got pple so boliao dun slp at nite and so persistently throughout so many days.... this is a genuine case la bruther...<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>There IS... If you do not personally know the EGO and character of this Alex guy, you won't know... [b]And if you have not yet know to what extent I've helped to advise Bee_gal to find out MORE about Alex in order to reach for her decision, you'll understand why this Alex guy is so angry...<br><br>which clearly shows that you did exerted lots of time and effort on her, online, phone or personal meetings. which none of us know about till the TS brought this up.<br><br>I think the pertinent question here did you influenced her to leave him, and i think the answer is yes.<br>And if you have not yet know to what extent I've helped to advise Bee_gal to find out MORE about Alex in order to reach for her decision<br><br>this line itself is very dammning evidence of that.<br><br>you also posted this<br><br>The truth is it's VERY UNLIKELY that I was the one who asked Bee_gal to break up with her bf. She's quite a VERY STRONG girl and it was HER OWN DECISION though I've advised her AGAINST the relationship<br><br>what makes you think that she is being restraint? isnt that a bit dramatic? if she is being restraint i think you have a responsiblity to make a police report.since you know her personally.<br><br>What intrigue me most is that you took very long time to answer the main question. Although i dont care much for this issue, im a more than a bit concerned about how you handle this altogether.<br><br>Subsequently , like it or not, you did show your true character and i think alex have succeeded in getting that point through.<br><br>If i have offered to meet up with beegal to talk about her boyfriend, i would have definitely brought my wife along,<br><br>Meeting her alone definitely put you out of the boundary of reasonable decency, and you alone knows what lurks in your mind or your real intention.<br><br>I seriously wont trust what you say from now .<br><br></strong>[/b]</blockquote>now this post is the one that you type and slam devil again, which this thread already die down, why do you have to bring it up, what is your point?</div>
