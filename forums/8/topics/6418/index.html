            <div class='col-md body'>okie..U pple..must have thought that this thread would be dicussing abt food--soups..hehehe..actually not very far from that..I actually wanna talk abt soup for the soul....<br><br>I will be posting some touching stories..and hopefully...they will let us appreciate things more..feel free to drop your comments...<br><br>here the first soup of the day...<br><br>Do It Today!<br><br>When I was superintendent of schools in Palo Alto,<br>California, Polly Tyner, the president of our board of<br>trustees, wrote a letter that was printed in the Palo Alto<br>Times. Polly's son, Jim, had great difficulty in school. He<br>was classified as educationally handicapped and required a<br>great deal of patience on the part of his parents and<br>teachers. But Jim was a happy kid with a great smile that<br>lit up the room. His parents acknowledged his academic<br>difficulties, but always tried to help him see his strengths<br>so that he could walk with pride. Shortly after Jim finished<br>high school, he was killed in a motorcycle accident. After<br>his death, his mother submitted this letter to the<br>newspaper.<br><br>Today we buried our 20-year-old son. He was killed<br>instantly in a motorcycle accident on Friday night. How I<br>wish I had known when I talked to him last that it would<br>be the last time. If I had only known I would have said,<br>"Jim, I love you and I'm so very proud of you."<br><br>I would have taken the time to count the many blessings<br>he brought to the lives of the many who loved him. I<br>would have taken time to appreciate his beautiful smile,<br>the sound of his laughter, his genuine love of people.<br><br>When you put all the good attributes on the scale and you<br>try to balance all the irritating traits such as the<br>radio which was always too loud, the haircut that wasn't<br>to our liking, the dirty socks under the bed, etc., the<br>irritations don't amount to much.<br><br>I won't get another chance to tell my son all I would<br>have wanted him to hear, but, other parents, you do have<br>a chance. Tell your young people what you would want them<br>to hear if you knew it would be your last conversation.<br>The last time I talked to Jim was the day he died. He<br>called me to say, "Hi, Mom! I just called to say I love<br>you. Got to go to work. Bye." He gave me something to<br>treasure forever.<br><br>If there is any purpose at all to Jim's death, maybe it<br>is to make others appreciate more of life and to have<br>people, especially families, take the time to let each<br>other know just how much we care.<br><br>You may never have another chance. Do it today!<br><br>hope U all like it..hehehhee (a bit hungry liao..by the way, me like cream of mushroom...)</div>
