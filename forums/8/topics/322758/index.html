              <p>Actually very simple, choose the pure ones out from the rest. Book a date online. Buy rings(not necessary). Book a buffet for the guest after the ROM. Then go home, at night go karaoke sing song. 1 year later go wedding night. So simple.</p>
              <p>Although sound simple but the process is very tiring and occassionary quarrel (quarrel about everything including to go for anullment). So both must know what you want and where you heading lor.</p>

              <p>Just propose. can liao.You want to get her engagement ring or not is up to you. make the engagement a little bit memorable so that its something she can remember rather than complain that you only say to buy HDB.</p>
              <p>when ROm, just get the wedding bands and book the date of ROM. Book quick because lots of people book also.</p>
              <p>Shop of a reliable bridal shop. they will more or less tell you want to do cause they are so experienced and don't spend too much on the photos.</p>
              <p>Wedding dinner can always settle months or years later. Anyways the rest of the activities, all your relatives will tell you what to do and push you along the "marriage" path</p>

              <p>2)  There can be an enaggement ceremony after which you call each other finacee but not married yet, by law, you are still not legal.  Agreeing to it does not mean anything.  Likewise, you can registered your marriage and yet not get any wedding, but she is still your wife legally by law.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) ROM and church wedding, what do you really want to do?  ROM can be different from church wedding.  You see, you can registered with ROM for marriage and not have a church wedding till later date, or not at all but you are still legally married. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I suggest you check with your church about your wedding date and ask them whether they do the arrangement for you to have your registeration at church instead of at ROM office.  Many do provide this service.  If your church as a registrar that can ordain your wedding or you can get someone who can do it for you at your church wedding, no problem then.  Do check with ROM or your church.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4)  Wedding buffet and dinner on the same day?  If you can afford both by all means, but that will cost you a bomb and not forgetting your friends and relatives who will be giving anyg pow and gifts.  Do you really want to burden them?  Besides, what time will your buffet be? and then follow by dinner, can they really eat?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I only had church wedding and buffet at home for relatives and some close friends.  Even church decoration was shared with another couple who hadppened to had theirs 2 hours after mine.  They didn't mind and also due to time constraint.  Dinner was at restaurant in the evening.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5)  IF you are choosing special dates especially for chinese parents, some must be "Good" auspicous day, then you better book way in advances, check with the restaurant.  Sometimes, the queue can be as far back as &gt;1 yr, that's what my brother did, what's more, restaurant impose restriction due to that very day was very important to chinese.  For me no problem, 1 yr in advance no problem booking</p>

              <p>You can find out at the shops, just ask to look at the engagement ring and wedding bands, they will show you what they are. And its important to find out the size of her left 4th finger if you wish to buy it in secret. You can use a string to measure. Anyways, Wedding band just a ring that is put on during the ROM ceremony. Got diamond or not is not important.  usually don't have much on wedding bands <a href="http://www.weddingbands.com/">http://www.weddingbands.com/</a></p>
              <p>No after you propose, if you want to put a ring on her, that will only be the engagement ring. That one is optional ...</p>
