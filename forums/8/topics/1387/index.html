            <div class='col-md body'>Perhaps the most famous, scariest and violent ghost in the Malaysian culture. Primarily, the Malays believe that it originates from a still born child, women who dies while giving birth, women who were killed by the pontianak or their spirits captured by them. The phrase "Pontianak" was believed from the acronym of "Perempuan Mati Beranak" in the Malay language, meaning the woman death by childbirth. After such death, precautions are taken to prevent them from rising like<br><br>Putting glass beads in the corpses mouth so that they can't shriek<br><br>Placing eggs under the corpses armpits so that they can't fly<br><br>Placing needles in their palms so that they can't fly also<br>( apparently the palm helps the pontianak to fly )<br><br>Pontianak usually announces its presence through baby cries or turn themselves into beautiful lady and frighten or kill the unlucky who enter or pass through their vicinity. It usually disguise itself as a beautiful young lady to attract its victim (usually male). Its presence sometimes can be detected by a nice floral fragrance of the 'kemboja' (a type of flower) followed by an awful stench afterwards. The distance of a pontianaks cries are very tricky. The Malays believe that if the cry is soft means that the pontianak is near and if it is loud then it must be far.<br>Want to know how a pontianak kills? It digs into your stomach with its long sharp fingernails and feed on it to survive. And want to know why we don't hang our clothes at night outside the house? It's because people believe that it sniffs your clothes to suck your blood.<br>It is also believed that the pontianak can be killed by plunging a nail down the back of its neck whereby it will transform the pontianak into a beatiful normal girl.<br><br>(article from SGFOG)<br><br>------------------<br>Sukoru Reonhato aka Lucifer en' vincent.<br>~*~ THE FALLEN ANGEL ~*~<br><span style="font-style: italic;">I am too sinful for what I have done, I quit hacking and went bonker.

            <div class='col-md body'>(a story kope from Sfog)<br><br>This story happened quite a while ago about last month.<br><br>I was boarding the last train on my way home to Toa Payoh. It was a late sunday night and no one else was around except for a couple on the other side of the platform.<br><br>Just as i was messaging my friend on my handphone, i notice something at the corner of my eye. My "attention" was diverted to the water-cooler which was at the far end of the platform. I saw a white figure (who looks like that of a girl's) hovering towards me. In fact when I looked properly, it was wearing a hooded cape and there wasn't a face in it but just a pair of yellow eyes. It was then that i was totally rooted to the ground and broke out in cold sweat. I simply froze in terror, awaiting my death.<br><br>When the figure was about a metre away from me, I suddenly plucked up the courage to bolt out of the platform and sprinted down the steps. In the midst of it all, i dropped my Nokia8250 handphone but i didn't care. All that concerned me was to get out of the station as fast as my legs could carry me. When I got to the gantry, I was a little calm to see human beings there. I immediately got out of there and flagged down a taxi to get home. I was too scared to go back and take the train.<br><br>The next day when I went back to the station to ask the staff if they saw my handphone and told them what happened to me, the head officer said I was probably too exhausted and was haulicinating. Since then, I tried not to take the MRT late at night again. Those of you who have a habit of taking late or last train rides better beware.........<br><br></div>
