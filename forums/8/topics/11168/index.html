            <div class='col-md body'>I got three word for TV Mobile and that is Suck Suck Suck...<br>Lousy show, the image and the cracking sound. Want to have a good sleep in the bus also cannot. Really I pity the bus captain as they have to hear the sound of the TV from day to night. In fact, few days ago the bus I boarded, the bus captain was so irrated with the TV that he turn down the TV.<br>Anyway I have a sugestion for Mediacorp, they can improve on the programme, reception and the sound quality. They also could have install some sort of button in front of every seat, so if people don't want to watch, they can press that button. Then the bus will acculmated all the votes to see whether the passenger want to watch the TV. The majority of votes will win. If more votes are for TV, the Televison will be on, if not, it will automatic shut off, until the votes change again.<br>But the bottom line is, please give me back my peace. Please take away those TV unless you can do some improvement on it.<br><br>------------------<br>A few questions that I need to know, how u could ever hurt me so. I need to know what I've done wrong and how long it's been going on. Was it that I never paid enough attention? or did I not give enough affection. Not only will ur ans keep me sane but I'll know never to make the same mistake again. U can tell me to my face or even on the phone, u can write it in a letter. Either way I have to know!<br>-Progene</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>At first TVMobile seemed like something interesting. At least you know you can still watch the TV if you have nothing better to do on the bus.<br><br>Now that it's launched, we've come to realise that not only is the reception disappointing, but also the noises that it makes when there's no reception and the frustration it gives when a programme being shown is interrupted by a blank screen that makes TVMobile quite unpopular in Singaporeans. Just take a look at the number of complaints in the papers.<br><br>And what's even more interesting pointed out by a friend of mine is that one of the things we see on TVMobile was this message from (was it Mediacorp?):<br><br>Mediacorp would like to congratulate TVMobile for its SUCCESSFUL launch.....etc.<br><br>Duh! Successful indeed!<br><br>------------------<br>Half the work and twice the fun!</div>
