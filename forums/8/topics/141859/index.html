            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.greatwisdomcenter.org/images/buddha_blessing.jpg"><br><br>"Buddha" means  the awakened one  that is, someone who has woken up from the dream of being a separate ego in a material universe. Gautama Siddhartha, whom we affectionately, ridiculously, call the Buddha, taught for forty-five years. In all those years, and in all the hundreds of thousands of teaching words that he uttered, his message was simply this: "You are all Buddhas. There is nothing that you have to achieve. Just open your eyes"<br><br>It is proper to doubt. Do not be led by holy scriptures, or by mere logic or inference, or by appearances, or by authority of religious teachers. But when you realize the something is unwholesome and bad for you, give it up. And  when you realize that something is wholesome and good for you, do it.<br><br>As a mother at the risk of her life watches over her only child, so let everyone cultivate a boundlessly compassionate mind towards all beings.<br><br>______<br><br>When you see the unborn, uncreated, unconditioned, you are liberated from everything born, created, and conditioned.<br><br>______<br><br>A man walking along a highroad sees a great river, its near bank dangerous and frightening, its far bank safe. He collects sticks and foliage, makes a raft, paddles across the river, and reaches the other shore, he takes the raft and puts it on his head and walks with it on his head wherever he goes. Would he be using the raft in an appropriate way? No; a reasonable man will realize that the raft has been very useful to him in crossing the river and arriving safely on the other shore, but that once he has arrived, it is proper to leave the raft behind and walk on without it. This is using the raft appropriately.<br><br>In the same way, all truths should be used to cross over; they should not be held on to once you have arrived. You should let go of even the most profound insight or the most wholesome teaching; all the more so, unwholesome teachings.<br><br>Be the lamp to yourself. Be your own confidence. Hold to the truth within yourself, as to the only truth.</div>
