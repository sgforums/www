            <div class='col-md body'>Eric Khoo's new movie....... "Be With Me"<br><br>Call it a grand return. Eight years after his last movie, Eric Khoo has returned with a film about love and hope - his third after Mee Pok Man and 12 Storeys - and it has scored him an immediate world premiere.<br><br>Be With Me has beaten 799 international entries to open the prestigious Director's Fortnight category at the Cannes International Film Festival this year.<br><br>Other films which have been accorded this honour include Lee Ang's Eat Drink Man Woman (1994).<br><br>Mr Kenneth Tan, managing director of cinema chain Golden Village and chairman of the Singapore Film Society, says Khoo's Cannes coup is 'like having a Harvard MBA'.<br><br>Director's Fortnight's artistic director Olivier Pere told Life! in an e-mail interview that Be With Me was his 'first and final choice' for the opening film.<br><br>'It is a very sensitive, very emotional and very universal piece of art and cinema, perfect for an opening screening of a big international festival,' Mr Pere adds. He watched the film while on a talent-scouting trip in the region a month ago.<br><br>The Director's Fortnight runs parallel to the main Official Competition - the heart of the festival where movies compete for prizes like the Palme d'Or (Best Film) - but is a festival highlight because it is seen as being more daring and edgy than the latter.<br><br>So Khoo, 39, can now count himself among Fortnight's alumni, which include Martin Scorsese, Spike Lee and Japanese auteur Nagisa Oshima.<br><br>Be With Me was, in fact, also invited for screening in another Cannes category, Un Certain Regard.<br><br>But Khoo was forced to choose between the two. 'It was a tough choice,' he says.<br><br>Be With Me - which has already been snapped up by a major European distributor - will be Singapore's only second full-length feature film to be invited to Cannes.<br><br>The first, 12 Storeys, is also one of his. It was screened at Cannes in 1997.<br><br>The only other Singaporean to have had her film screened at Cannes is film-maker Tan Pin Pin. However, her Moving House (2001) was a short, not full-length, flick and was shown only at a Cannes fringe event.<br><br><strong>No need to celebrate</strong><br><br>Still, when Life! met Khoo and his close journalist friend Wong Kim Hoh - who co-wrote the script for Be With Me - for breakfast at the Goodwood Park Hotel last week, they seemed to be taking the triumph in their stride.<br><br>They will fly to Cannes on May 10 for the film's opening on May 12 (see other story).<br><br>'We spent too many nights drinking up to three bottles of wine a night while working on this film, so I don't think there's any need for celebratory drinks now,' says Khoo cheerily, in between wolfing down bacon and egg.<br><br>Indeed. Truth be told, the film would never have been made if he had not snapped out of his procrastinatory stupor.<br><br>Since 12 Storeys opened in 1997, he has only lent his name to film projects, turning producer for everything from Liang Po Po - The Movie (1999) to Zombie Dogs (2004).<br><br>He has also been grooming young film talents such as Royston Tan, who made the criti cally-acclaimed movie 15.<br><br>But directing a full-length film? Not a single frame.<br><br>Still, ideas were a-popping in his mind and he broached the idea of making a movie about hope to Wong in 2002.<br><br>They worked on several drafts, even tackling things like capital punishment.<br><br>It was his chance meeting with 62-year-old Theresa Chan at a wedding in 2003 that proved pivotal for his new film.<br><br>Chan, who lost her sight and hearing to meningitis when she was in her teens, still managed to travel the world and learn English in the United States.<br><br>Her zesty nature and unbridled love for life helped him refine his film idea and reinforce hope as a theme.<br><br>'We had the whole tapestry in place, save for that missing piece, that central motif. Theresa was it,' he says.<br><br>But Chan not only played herself eventually in Be With Me, she also jolted Khoo back to his senses as a film-maker.<br><br>'She was sending me gifts like a Parker Pen with my name engraved on it and a Citizen watch to tell me to get started on writing the script as time was running out,' he adds, with a laugh.<br><br>The script was cobbled together within two months, and filming finally commenced last Nov 12.<br><br>It was shot in 15 days with digital cameras and, with the help of post-production house Infinite Frameworks, had a trim budget of $200,000.<br><br>Save for MediaCorp actresses Lynn Poh and Ezann Lee, the cast is a line-up of fresh faces.<br><br>Among them is Chiew Sung Ching, 61, Khoo's former English tutor, whose understated performance as a grieving widower is one of the film's highlights.<br><br>The result? A poignant look at love at different stages of life, from crushes to losing loved ones in the twilight years.<br><br>Mr Raphael Millet, the cultural attache to the Embassy of France here, says he likes the film because it is open to many layers of interpretation: 'Khoo asks many questions, but does not give the answers. He leaves space for the audience to find out things on their own.'<br><br>Right now, Khoo is just glad that, with Wong's help, his latest film is out after so many false starts.<br><br>He says with a laugh: 'We've had many miscarriages along the way. We finally conceived, and everybody loves the baby.'</div>
