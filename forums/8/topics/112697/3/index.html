From the start of human history,we see that all e arrogant pple fail,those who think they know everything probably knows nothing at all...in fact it takes great bravery to aknowledge they r wrong. I do not know wat is happening in ur life rite now to cause you to vent ur anger on pple who have never offended u in any way.If u need help,just say so,i m sure we will try our best to offer help or advice....  Watever problems u have in ur mind or heart rite now...please learn to let go....hurting other pple will not make u feel better......  i m sure e pple here will be more than willingly to forgive ur mistakes as they have a heart big enuff to forgive those who hurt them.</div>

Just like a Frog in the Well presumed the Well is the Whole World &amp; Universe, One fine day, it come out of the Well, It start to realise how big the World is but he refused to acknowledge it, non-receptive to the surroundings &amp; other Bigger Creatures on Earth, as it tried to cross the Road, a Car knocked it &amp; off it goes to the Netherworld. Be it Fate, Destiny, Bad Karmic Ties or simply a personal choice, thats the Way of Nature...Universal Law... If One refused to repent there is nothing much You or I can do. We are not "GOD" definitely  "GOD" will not harbour One who Abuses His Name... Good Deeds are meant for Good Cause &amp; those who are in need &amp; worthy of it, not to be literally abused although its out of Goodwill... God Bless You...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>
