            <div class='col-md body'>I must say a goodday to all who is reading this. It is so shameless of me to even announce anything using a thread. Anyway....Today is a significant day...it is the day I ORD from my service with the nation...so from today onwards it is Goodbye to Mr policeman status...and hello to my long lost pink friend(My IC). The feeling is good, it is a feeling I discribe as liberation. I am now free to do as my mind and heart does, having an identity that I can forge as totally my own. No longer will I have to be reminded of my testicular bondage as my boss fondly calls of national service.*laffs*<br><br>Today is also a significant day because, this is the last topic, the last post, I will post in this forum. I sure hope I can keep to my promise. *smiles* I am going to quit this forum. Now many of your mind must has been set rolling.....dun think too much...for if I do not tell you, you most probably could never guess the reason, and of course I am goign to bear my gut out this last time.<br><br>This story I am going to tell is most probably the silliest you would have ever heard. But it is what happened to a silly boy 3 years ago, before his enlistment to national service. Now this silly boy is telling this silly story to all.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>If any of you have read the <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/ubb/Forum3/HTML/000002-2.html" rel="nofollow">sob story competition thread in the creative corner</a>, you all will know this sad story of mine where I was being dumped 3 yrs ago by a very nice girl. Well like I said, last I heard she is now settle nicely in Aussie with her husband. Well, after that event, you can say I am rather dissapointed...not with woman of course...not with such a wonderful creation. I am dissapointed with myself...with the fact that I am not capable or good enough to keep my woman. So this silly boy made a silly vow....not to go into a relationship again until he thinks he is capable enough, at least until after NS when he can fully be responsible for the other party's future. Actually, the main reason is not so noble I can tell you, basically it is this silly boy actually blames NS partially for this failed relationship. *laffs* So silly I must say...anyway this Silly boy decided that he must stay away from R/S at all costs... so somehow he came to a silly conculsion that he have to make girls not dare come close to him. Silly...stupid whatever you call it...it is there....<br><br>Well anyway, the story goes on...the silly boy goes into NS....tried to make the most out of it...trained hard and tried to grain himself into a man he thinks is worthy enough for a true relationship. Well...you can't say he failed totally, he somehow made it to be an officer despite his poor physical fitness. And being the lucky person he always has been...he is posted to a rare vocation...where he has access to the internet and a environment where he is able to learn things he never knew he would touch on.<br><br>So one fine day this silly boy stumble onto a site on the wolrd wide web...a site call SGforums. He is immersely amazed by the many R/S problems the people there are having, and of course not to exclude the many girls there are in the forum, and he thinks that this is one place where he can have great fun buayaing the gals just for fun sake.<br><br>Soon enough he is in the forum almost everyday, trying to romance every gal he can get his hands on, so much so that his value in words are no longer there, the gals are soon numbed to his sweet nothings which are not really sweet actually.*laffs* but throughout his stay in the forum, the silly boy got to know some friends, some really nice ones.<br><br>But soon enough within half a year, he has ORDed. And the time frame for him is up. Though he still thinks that he is not ready for a relationship, after 3 years of healing, he is now again confident of himself, that he is able to handle a R/s despite being not so perfect, he knows after being a buaya for 3 full years that he still have what it takes, not totally but it is still there. He too learns that a relationship is maintained by 2 committed parties, and not something he can uphold alone. He knows for a fact that he may become the most perfect in the world but if there is no love, the R/S will not work out.<br><br>After 3 yrs, it is time to get a new lease of life, the time to settle down and be a buaya no more. Of course his flirty nature still stays as usual, but he will most probably let it all out like a tiger on the prowl, rather he will keep this nature and try to save it for the one who will hopefully like the treatment.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>This silly boy too wants to concentrate on his career, and beingthe ambitious person he is, he knows he really need to concentrate to achieve what he wants. So this silly boy, decides to quit the forums he frequents. He fears that the many happenings going on in the forum might affect him someday despite his nonchalant nature to such things. He feels too much time is wasted and that he needs to move on. Such is what this silly boy feels.<br><br>To all my friends out there, I will definitely still keep in touch with you people, I am always just a phone call away. As for those who I have not met, we may meet someday, we may not. But all in all, you might still see me online on the IRC once in awhile....or on ICQ....if you know my contact...and I might still post in the forum if I ever found the urge too great to resist. Till then...I am going away for a while at least. *smiles*<br><br>All the best to all your endeavours in the future, and may this post be infuse with blessings so that it will bless all who reads it.<br><br>p.s.<br>If anyone of you out there thinks that it is because of some recent happenings in the forum that cause me to leave....then ask the others...I have been thinking of quiting for some time. The ORD date made it significant to the chain of events so I decided to quit today.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
