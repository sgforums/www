From what I know, there are Christians who distance themselves from CHC and do not agree with it's teachings and sorts. There's also a post in this thread which reflect this claim, which I shall quote for easy reference.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by unclebutcher:</div><div class="quote_body">chc is a very stigmatised church amongst conservative christians like myself. we shy away from it. the only thing i know abt these kinds of churches is that they say if you believe in Jesus, you will have a prosperous life, full of blessings etc etc...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote>And your logic is not flawless. For example, just because a dog and a table have 4 legs, it doesn't mean they are the same thing. Or perhaps, people should refer to members of CHC or even just mega churches instead of using Christians all the time to avoid any misunderstandings.<br><br>And, indeed, there's no denying that CHC is doing it's part in contributing to the society and fulfill God's aim. However, having a charity and community service arm doesn't prove that all the donations are used on the society, or that none gets leaked. I believe people are concerned of the money that is not used, not the money that is used. A lot of money is being donated by it's members, but there doesn't seem to be as much being repaid. Little auditing is being done, so people, even members themselves, do not know exactly how much does the church receive as donations. The opaqueness of the churches' funds doesn't allow any useful understanding of their uses.<br><br>Having ultra luxurious building and facilities is not necessarily bad as these are used by the people who contributed and, therefore, deserved them. However, it raises the question as to whether the money could have been better used by helping the needy instead, which is ultimately the aim of God. Using the donations on themselves may lead others to think that the members are more selfish than generous, as the members' needs are being met first. Why consider a new building when the one in Jurong is doing very fine and is, in fact, doing better than the facilities of some other churches.<br><br>Don't flame me for attacking Christians or any particular group. I've been very careful to use qualifying terms to ensure that my claims are not absolute and that they can be refuted. It'd be helpful if the parties mentioned provide substantiated answers to eliminate any misunderstandings that people, like myself, have over mega churches.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by AndrewPKYap:</div><div class="quote_body">Most people put their tithes into the offering bag...</div></blockquote>Not surprising if the church doesn't practise the more 'mandatory' kind of tithing. If you read 4794's reply, you have to write down your details if you meant it as a tithe. This is how 4794 understands tithing.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>In churches today where offering is practised properly, they will pass the bag around telling you what it is for. It is up to you whether you want to support or not. For example, the offering can be for:<br><br>1. Missionary efforts, like one of your church mates is going for a Campus Crusade missionary trip.<br><br>2. Evangelical missions, like a gospel rally next week.<br><br>etc.<br><br>Offerings and tithings are different from the biblical perspective. Tithing is an Old Testament practice somehow perverted by Christians. Many Christians are unaware of how tithing is practised today in Judaism. Come on, Christians are the ones accusing Jews of following Old Testament laws rigidly, yet when it comes to tithing, they happily disregard what Jews have to say about tithing.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Offering, as practised in churches today, is a New Testament practice. In the New Testament context, the money collected goes into helping other churches:<br><br><blockquote>1Cor 16:<br>1Now about the collection for God's people: Do what I told the Galatian churches to do. 2On the first day of every week, each one of you should set aside a sum of money in keeping with his income, saving it up, so that when I come no collections will have to be made. 3Then, when I arrive, I will give letters of introduction to the men you approve and send them with your gift to Jerusalem.</blockquote>The Apostle Paul is also advocating some kind of social equality:<br><br><blockquote>2Cor 8:<br><br>8I am not commanding you, but I want to test the sincerity of your love by comparing it with the earnestness of others. 9For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that you through his poverty might become rich.<br><br>10And here is my advice about what is best for you in this matter: Last year you were the first not only to give but also to have the desire to do so. 11Now finish the work, so that your eager willingness to do it may be matched by your completion of it, according to your means. 12For if the willingness is there, the gift is acceptable according to what one has, not according to what he does not have.<br><br>13Our desire is not that others might be relieved while you are hard pressed, but that there might be equality. 14At the present time your plenty will supply what they need, so that in turn their plenty will supply what you need. Then there will be equality, 15as it is written: "He who gathered much did not have too much, and he who gathered little did not have too little."</blockquote></div>
