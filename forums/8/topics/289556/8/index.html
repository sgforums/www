            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Tithes</strong></span><br>hey blackpen, you're serioursly wrong. The problem with some churches are wrong doctrines pertaining to the collection of tithes. It has been twisted to the way to portray as you give offerings abundantly, God will bless you abundantly too. But for those who do not tithe, will not receive the same level of blessings.<br><br>Who are we to help God decide how much blessings he should give to who. And who are we to bargain with God on his blessings.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What is the significance of tithes</strong></span><br>At the same time, tithes are not as simple as the 10% God stated in the bible. What God wants is absolute obedience. When you're giving the 10%, are you sure you have no bad blood with any person? If you have, put the money at the side of the altar, go and make peace first before your return the money into the altar. Therefore every week you're supposed to be reflecting on your deeds before you give. And not automatically give for the sake of giving!<br><br>There is absolutely nothing wrong in being blessed with prosperity. But it is how the person prosper that makes the difference. By devil or by God.<br><br>I'd not judge how the people who play around with the tithes meant for God. But remember the story of what happened to Achan who embezzled money meant to return to God.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Use of Tongues</span></strong><br>On top of that, those who insisted that all speak in tongues. Have they understood what is tongues? And how to speak in tongues? Read the whole of 1COR14.  It is a dummy's guide to how to speak in tongues. And note the difference with some of the current churches today.<br><br>Some people may argue that God speaks in mysteries that we do not understand. And these form the base of our tongues. But this mysteries that some churches define as is not the right way. God is not a fool. God does not make people blabber in nonsense that no one understands. The mysteries that God is speaking is the profound knowledge which makes sense to us yet we do not see the meaning without his help. And not gibbberish nonsense.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Who should preach?</strong></span><br>It has been stated in the bible that no woman should preach. Woman can help out everything in the church expect being a pastor. But how many churches and which churches are breeching this law that God has stated?<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The current diversion of churches</strong></span><br>The basic fundamentals have been treated as non existance. The bible has been perceived in a perversed way for the sake of benefits. Who are the ones doing that?<br><br>I believe you're well aware of what is the price of poking fun of God. Let those who do it answer to God themselves. The rest have done their part to advise and warn. But if the fool insisted to be right and let him reap what he sowed when he pass away from here.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Real Blessings</strong></span><br>Life with only Wealth &amp; health on this earth does not mark the blessings of God. Some may endure cancer and poverty yet maintains his faith in God are those who triumph. For those who endure through trials are the blessed ones. They will receive the crown of life. For God does not tempt. God disciplines.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Difference of Trials and temptations</strong></span><br>Temptations are by the devil to cause sin. Trials are from God to build growth.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>For the rest of my christian friends,</strong></span><br>I have said enough. The charismatic movement is moving in the direction of asking for trouble by challenging God. I went through the stage of blind stubborness in the charismatic movement before. Utterly brainwashed and unsaved. And no one on earth was able to open my eyes. Only God was able to. There're many people who have left charismatic churches now wandering around in their spiritual life. The harvest is plenty. Go out and spread the right gospel to them. And let's not waste time like my late-father who wasted 60 years of his life only to reconcile with God at his death bed.<br><br>Spread the gospel not by hard sell. But by good daily conduct. So that non believers who sees your conduct may be convinced of the greatness of Christianity. The believers who sees your good conduct may be encouraged. Do not do anything to cause your christian friends to stumble. Because if you do that, you're working for the devil to create temptations.<br><br>God bless you all.</div>
