Do not be deceived that you can buy God's blessings with conditional obedience. Who are we to bargain with God.<br><br>Even murderers who repent &amp; accepts Jesus as his personal savior will be given a chance to go to heaven. But do not expect to get out of the crime without paying the consequences.<br><br>When a man ask God for a fish do you think God will give him a snake?<br><br>The tithes issue is controversial. And this issue will be repeated on and on again and again. Because false teachers will not die down. But tithes are not as what is it portrayed as giving to God in abundance we will receive in abundance. It is about reflecting on your deeds, absolute obedience to God. Although giving the 10% is God's order. But you need to know that in order to qualify to give, you must not have bad blood with anyone. If you have, put the money at the side and go make peace before you return to put the money back in.<br><br>Seriously, do you think God wants your money? The answer is NO. He only wants your absolute obedience. Obedience not only towards giving. It is also towards your daily conduct. The whole think comes as a complete package. Not even one part less.<br><br><span style="color: red;">If you have a bad blood with your neighbour. And the relationship is not getting better. Every week you purposely wash your car next to his so that used stray soap and grime can hit his car. Everyday your neighbour bypass your corridor with his dog and allowed his dog to pee at your doorstep. And you just had an arguement with him this morning before going to church. Then you go to church and give the church a lot of money while asking God in condition to bless you with a bigger car so that you can piss your neighbour off though how much you deny &amp; the coveted promotion you longed for in your office.<br><br>What is this different from the hypocrital pharisees? </span><br><br>However there are people who distort how tithes are supposed to be taken for their own advantage that created the current phenomenon of:<br><br>church = $<br><br>Do not be deceived as many false teachers will be coming out as stated in the bible. For these people who claimed that they know Jesus will not be acknowledge during the day of judgement. There is nothing anybody can do about it. The best is to distance yourself from their activities. But continue to win them over with good conduct &amp; your faith in God.<br><br>Contact Singapore Bible College for more info if you need help to understand christianity. Just email them anonymously if you dun feel comfortable to be identified. Don't feel pressurized to do anything for God. Do not yield to pressurization to attend Church. For the gospel has to be spreaded with love and accepted willingly.<br><br>The Singapore Bible College website.<br><a href="http://www.sbc.edu.sg" rel="nofollow">www.sbc.edu.sg</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Phaze:<br>I went to CHC about 7 weeks.<br><br>The thing that struck me was the 'warm-up' pastor. He's the guy who talks before the offering. He usually says something like this.<br><br>"If you want God to do great things in your life, you must do great things for God! We accept Visa, Mastercard, American Express, cheque or internet banking."<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I have a friend in CHC and he gives far more than 10% of his income. And he's absolutely sincere.<br><br>I once asked him if he was worried the church was misusing the money.<br><br>He gave all the usual explanations about how having money furthers god's work etc. But he finished off with this.<br><br>"At the end of the day, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>it doesn't matter if the church is misusing the money</strong></span>. I'm not really giving to the church. I'm giving to god. The money represents my work, my blood, my sweat. I give to god because He is worth it and I love Him.  If the church betrays the trust as an agent of god's will, it's a terrible thing. But it doesn't change my relationship with Christ."[/b]</blockquote>Yes it does matter, we are told to be good stewards of what has been given to us.  If we misuse our blessings i.e giving to the wrong cause to further that wrongness, we have to face the consequences of our actions.<br><br></div>
