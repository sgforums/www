            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>It seems you have not read the previous posts so please allow me to clarify.<br><br>First of all, I am an atheist so I do not believe in god so my statement that "god did not appreciate mother theresa" was meant to be taken facetiously.<br><br>The context was, in previous posts, we discussed the fact that Mother Theresa was an atheist who did not believe in god. God never revealed himself to her til her dying day.<br><br><a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1655415,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1655415,00.html</a><br><br>Another poster then commented that perhaps god didn't appreciate her efforts and thus did not reveal himself to her.<br><br>The comment on her contribution to the Vatican coffers comes from the fact that she received untold millions, possibly hundreds of millions in donations. Yet she spent very little of it. Where did the money go? She most certainly didn't spend it on herself and her order. So most likely the money went to the Vatican.<br><br><a href="http://members.lycos.co.uk/bajuu/" rel="nofollow">http://members.lycos.co.uk/bajuu/</a><br><br>Also, it seems that although she was fundamentally an atheist, her search for god effectively made her a religious fanatic. She supported poverty and felt poverty was good. She felt earthly suffering was good and did little to end it. Some would argue that her help amounted to extending life so that people could suffer longer.<br><br>These are indeed harsh accusations. But look at the evidence with an open mind.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by lagrangen:</div><div class="quote_body">You see. We give our tithes and offerings as a sacrifice to God and we have no control where the money goes to and how is it handled. When we've put our trust in God and fulfil our personal obligations why should we be concerned with the nitty gritty, about how the funds are managed, about how much salary the pastor is taking?<br><br>You are giving to know that your money is put into good use or are you giving as an obedience to God?<br><br>As a believer we, give willingly, having the faith that we are building God's kingdom and spread the gospel.<br><br>Yes I know there are lots and lots of people out there who are very concerned about whether the church is mishandling the funds its members give or not putting it into its best use.<br><br>But can i ask, who are you to judge, make baseless one sided assumptions just because one church pastor tend to be more prosperous than others?<br><br>Please know a church is a place of religious worship, not charitable organisation.<br><br>Please stop flaming for the sake of doing so.<br><br></div></blockquote>Not really true to a certain extend.<br>No doubt the offerings and tithes are given to God unconditionally.<br>The pastors &amp; staffs managing the money is merely God's accountant and does not own a single cent in the tithes. He is allowed to draw a decent salary. But not to the extend of abusive. Abusive denotes capacity to cause his brothers to fall. And from the current stages, some churches are already at that extend. The worst part is that they still feel they have done nothing wrong. The money that is being held temporarily by church pastoral staffs have to be transparent and open to all the members of the church explaining every single cent is going towards what cause.<br><br>And being a slave of christ is never easy. Those who want to carry Jesus's cross will never have a good life on earth. But through sufferings and trials for Jesus, we earn the crown of life in heaven where our stored riches do not get looted. Therefore it is essential to come clean with the offerings collected in order to not cause any brothers to stumble when there is hidden accounts.<br><br>Some churches tabulate a monthly collection table to show to the members. There're some weekly too. And these tabulated datas show where does the money goes to. The accuracy goes down to every single cent.<br><br>But you are very right that since no one has the right to judge, we can only remind our own pastors about things they might carry too far. If he listens then it will be good. If he does not listen, then carry on winning them with our own good conduct but distance ourselves from those activities that are not right.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Let me just clarify a few terms that may be confused:<br><br>1) Offering:<br><br>Given by anyone who visits a church, similar to those in other places of worship. there is no requirement of any minimum amount here and people just give any amount they want.<br><br>The $ from offerings are used for things like paying the salary of staff, printing newsletters, printing evangelistic materials etc. Offerings are not used to build any church buildings.<br><br>2) Tithes:<br><br>this is what MEMBERS of the church give. it is 10% of what you earn as stated in the Bible. By members i mean those who attend the church regularly and want to be part of a church. it does not include those who just drop by for a visit here and there.<br><br>Tithes are given to the church you feel you belong to and are used in the same way as offering.<br><br>3) Building fund:<br><br>As the name suggests, its is collected for the purpose of building a church building or paying for the rentals, buying chairs, repair of church building etc.<br><br>Building fund is a specific fund. This means that the people who donate usually have to write specifically that it is going into the building fund. Means that it cannot be used to pay salaries etc.<br><br>So from this, we should understand that the $ used to build the buildings comes from the MEMEBERS. It does not come from the $ donated by the general public. Those go under offerings and are not touched for building.<br><br>4) lastly, i believe that we should not go around throwing accusations. i have no problems with a pastor getting rich as long as he is not "stealing" money or filling his own pockets. a pastor can also earn money from his own business paid from his own money. i mean lets just look at the property market now. so many millionaires in singapore already.<br><br>i believe there are things called financial statements and people called auditors. since the government is helping various churches in singapore review their finances, lets not throw accusations. And if the government review clears all the churches of financial mismanagement, are we willing to accept the humble pie and make apologies to these people?<br><br></div>

I'm not even sure how to define 'abuse' in this case.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> And there is nothing wrong with her entrusting the money to the Vatican. The point I was trying to make is that many people thought they were donating money to help the poor, but they never gave a thought to how the money would be used. They trusted Mother Threasa to use the money appropriately. I'm sure some donors would have no qualms about the money going to the Vatican (of course this is speculative as no one knows where the money went). Others, however, may have wanted the money to be used in a more direct manner to benefit the poor. I do feel, however, that donors have no cause for complaint if they never bothered to check how the money was used.<br><br>We could get into a whole 'nother discussion of whether it's ethical to solicit donations for one cause, and use the donations fr another cause.

Her ostentatious displays of poverty screamed, "I'm holier than you. I'm more pious than you."<br><br>When she met the Pope, she traveled to the Vatican by bus and wore a $1 robe (and how do you think we know the robe cost $1? Because we were told).

By the same token, televangelists and megachurch pastors who defraud their chuch members have also done a lot of good.<br><br>But if you define 'good' as reducing suffering, she hasn't done much good at all.<br><br>[quote]<strong><br>5) No matter how wise and intelligent she is, some of us will still see light in the other perspective and I still see lots more goodness from the deeds that she has done though some of it could of course have been done in a more effective manner.<br></strong></div></blockquote><strong>I've kinda wondered about this. What is more important? The ideal or the reality? I tend to think the reality is more important. But I accept I may be wrong. I do think for most people, they like the ideal of Mother Theresa and that idealized image of Mother Theresa they have does make them try to be better.

            <div class='col-md body'>"Some years after I became a Catholic, I joined Mother Teresa's<br>congregation, the Missionaries of Charity. I was one of her sisters for<br>nine and a half years, living in the Bronx, Rome, and San Francisco, until<br>I became disillusioned and left in May 1989. As I re-entered the world, I<br>slowly began to unravel the tangle of lies in which I had lived. I<br>wondered how I could have believed them for so long.<br><br>"Three of Mother Teresa's teachings that are fundamental to her religious<br>congregation are all the more dangerous because they are believed so<br>sincerely by her sisters. Most basic is the belief that as long as a<br>sister obeys she is doing God's will. Another is the belief that the<br>sisters have leverage over God by choosing to suffer. Their suffering<br>makes God very happy. He then dispenses more graces to humanity. The<br>third is the belief that any attachment to human beings, even the poor<br>being served, supposedly interferes with love of God and must be<br>vigilantly avoided or immediately uprooted. The efforts to prevent any<br>attachments cause continual chaos and confusion, movement and change in<br>the congregation. Mother Teresa did not invent these beliefs - they were<br>prevalent in religious congregations before Vatican II - but she did<br>everything in her power (which was great) to enforce them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"Once a sister has accepted these fallacies she will do almost anything.<br>She can allow her health to be destroyed, neglect those she vowed to<br>serve, and switch off her feelings and independent thought. She can turn<br>a blind eye to suffering, inform on her fellow sisters, tell lies with<br>ease, and ignore public laws and regulations.<br><br>Women from many nations joined Mother Teresa in the expectation that they<br>would help the poor and come closer to God themselves. When I left, there<br>were more than 3,000 sisters in approximately 400 houses scattered<br>throughout the world. Many of these sisters who trusted Mother Teresa to<br>guide them have become broken people. In the face of overwhelming<br>evidence, some of them have finally admitted that their trust has been<br>betrayed, that God could not possibly be giving the orders they hear. It<br>is difficult for them to decide to leave - their self-confidence has been<br>destroyed, and they have no education beyond what they brought with them<br>when they joined. I was one of the lucky ones who mustered enough courage<br>to walk away.<br><br>"It is in the hope that others may see the fallacy of this purported way<br>to holiness that I tell a little of what I know. Although there are<br>relatively few tempted to join Mother Teresa's congregation of sisters,<br>there are many who generously have supported her work because they do not<br>realize how her twisted premises strangle efforts to alleviate misery.<br>Unaware that most of the donations sit unused in her bank accounts, they<br>too are deceived into thinking they are helping the poor.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"As a Missionary of Charity, I was assigned to record donations and write<br>the thank-you letters. The money arrived at a frantic rate. The mail<br>carrier often delivered the letters in sacks. We wrote receipts for<br>checks of $50,000 and more on a regular basis. Sometimes a donor would<br>call up and ask if we had received his check, expecting us to remember it<br>readily because it was so large. How could we say that we could not<br>recall it because we had received so many that were even larger?<br><br>"When Mother spoke publicly, she never asked for money, but she did<br>encourage people to make sacrifices for the poor, to "give until it<br>hurts." Many people did - and they gave it to her. We received touching<br>letters from people, sometimes apparently poor themselves, who were<br>making sacrifices to send us a little money for the starving people in<br>Africa, the flood victims in Bangladesh, or the poor children in India.<br>Most of the money sat in our bank accounts.<br><br>"The flood of donations was considered to be a sign of God's approval of<br>Mother Teresa's congregation. We were told by our superiors that we<br>received more gifts than other religious congregations because God was<br>pleased with Mother, and because the Missionaries of Charity were the<br>sisters who were faithful to the true spirit of religious life.</div>

One summer<br>the sisters living on the outskirts of Rome were given more crates of<br>tomatoes than they could distribute. None of their neighbors wanted them<br>because the crop had been so prolific that year. The sisters decided to<br>can the tomatoes rather than let them spoil, but when Mother found out<br>what they had done she was very displeased. Storing things showed lack of<br>trust in Divine Providence.<br><br>"The donations rolled in and were deposited in the bank, but they had no<br>effect on our ascetic lives and very little effect on the lives of the<br>poor we were trying to help. We lived a simple life, bare of all<br>superfluities. We had three sets of clothes, which we mended until the<br>material was too rotten to patch anymore. We washed our own clothes by<br>hand.

She seemed obsessed with using<br>only the simplest of means for our work. Was this in the best interests<br>of the people we were trying to help, or were we in fact using them as a<br>tool to advance our own "sanctity?" In Haiti, to keep the spirit of<br>poverty, the sisters reused needles until they became blunt.

Investigation later revealed a pattern of negligence by the corporation and showed that previous warnings about lack of safety at the plant had been ignored by it. Throngs of angry relatives of victims greeted her at the airport and asked her advice and counsel. She gave it. She intoned her usual homily for solving complex problems: "Forgive, forgive, forgive." A group of residents in one of the worst slums in the nation's capital confronted her on her visit there and told her that they needed housing, jobs, and services -- not charity. They asked her what she was going to do about it. She advised, "First we must learn to love one another."</span><br><br>I would say she caused harm because people thought they were doing good when they donated to her. Because they thought Mother Theresa was taking care of the poor, their conscience was free.<br><br>There was another thread about a malay family with 10 children and the father could not support his children. In India, the situation was far worse. Mother Theresa was opposed to any form of contraception and claimed that abortion was the greatest destroyer of peace in the world.<br><br>I can't help but feel a tinge of anger at the following quote.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">When Mother Teresa was asked if she would agree that there are too many children in India she replied: "I do not agree because God always provides. He provides for the flowers and the birds, for everything in the world he has created. And these little children are his life. There never can be enough."</span><br><br>If god provides, why was the Missionaries of Charities even needed? Why did so many children have to die?

They are not allowed to watch TV or smoke or drink or invite friends, not even when they are dying, and so, of course, they are exceptionally depressed.

And my experience is so  much different from that of that poor bitter person.  And I believe my experience has -  hopefully -  made me a better person, a more devoted follower of my faith.<br><br>Mother  Teresa was more frial in person than on TV and fyi, she took medicine for herself.  Medicine was also provided for the sick and dying - prescribed by doctors, not Mother Teresa or her sisters.  As I am not a nurse, I did not dispense the medicine but I did help in "stock" take so I know there was medicine.<br><br>She believed in the virtue of poverty but that doesn't mean she lived in a cave. For instance if you were to give her a washing machine, she would not accept it for use for herself and her sisters but would send it to one of their homes to be used for washing the laundry of the people in their care.<br><br>Anyway, I see your mind is made up.  You want to believe the negative things about Mother Teresa.  So be it.  I do not want to labour this point with many posts day after day.  We each have our own opinions.

True, a church is a religious worship, u do ur part by going to the church on weekends to pray and seek forgiveness and hope that HE will watch over you. You give money in the hope that something good will come out of it. Yet it doesn't concern u 1 BIT where that money may go to instead? So the church or for that matter, any place of worship should not be held accountable to the publics??<br><br>Wow, u sure are a trusting person.<br><br></div></blockquote>But that is the spirit of donation whether to the Church, Temple, Charitable Organisation, Friend, Famiily member etc.  We don't with one hand give $ and with the other say give me an account.  I have done that only once when I had misgivings to "donate" money to someone and I wanted to be certain that that person used it well.<br><br>Place of worship should be held accountable only to their own followers. But public charitable organisation funded by tax payers etc should be made public.  This is my view.  I have donated money to places of worship, be it Muslim, Buddhist, Christian and I have not asked for an account.  I gave because I was just happy to give.</div>

However, religions should lose any tax privileges they may have.<br><br>If a religion wants to enjoy tax privileges, they should abide by the same rules as any other IPC.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by adetet:</div><div class="quote_body">The word of one bitter person who left her order does not convince me. I am a Buddhist but I lived with Mother Teresa's order for 2 years doing voluntary work.  And my experience is so  much different from that of that poor bitter person.  And I believe my experience has -  hopefully -  made me a better person, a more devoted follower of my faith.<br><br>Mother  Teresa was more frial in person than on TV and fyi, she took medicine for herself.  Medicine was also provided for the sick and dying - prescribed by doctors, not Mother Teresa or her sisters.  As I am not a nurse, I did not dispense the medicine but I did help in "stock" take so I know there was medicine.<br><br>She believed in the virtue of poverty but that doesn't mean she lived in a cave. For instance if you were to give her a washing machine, she would not accept it for use for herself and her sisters but would send it to one of their homes to be used for washing the laundry of the people in their care.<br><br>Anyway, I see your mind is made up.  You want to believe the negative things about Mother Teresa.  So be it.  I do not want to labour this point with many posts day after day.  We each have our own opinions.  Mine is not based on the rantings of a bitter person but from real life observatiion.<br><br>p.s. I just want to add that I have not read the entire ramblings of the bitter person as it is too long.  Sorry about that.</div></blockquote>What you want to believe is, of course, your own prerogative and there's no need to apologize if you don't wish to read.<br><br>I didn't realize that you spent 2 years working with Mother Theresa and of course, your personal testimonial is very powerful. And of course, why would you believe the accounts of others when you have seen with your own eyes. 2 years is also not an insignificant amount of time so you have a strong basis for your beliefs.<br><br>But of course, all you see is the good work done with what you think is very little. You don't realize that much has been given.<br><br>I do accept that Mother Theresa might have done some good. But I do think she could have done a lot more with what she had received. And I think too much money has gone unaccounted for except possibly to the Vatican. But of course, you have made it clear that you feel there is nothing wrong with that.<br><br>I never did dispute there were doctors, and there was medicine. My point was simply that it was very little compared to the amount of money coming in. And I know Mother Theresa didn't spend it on herself or the organization. However, they did not spend it on the poor either.<br><br>I suspect this was a religious quirk of hers. She didn't want to spend anything, instead wanting people to donate or give things for free. I would explain further but it would make a long post already longer. And all this has already been covered before.<br><br>In any case, I will wish you well and leave you with a thought. Our eyes fool us all the time. It is critical thinking that allows us to reach beyond our all too human limitations.</div>
