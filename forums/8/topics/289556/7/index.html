            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by AndrewPKYap:</div><div class="quote_body">But I like the part where you said that they complain about Jews clinging on to the commandments while they are determined to cling on to tithing ...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>Well, to set the record straight, tithing is also an obligation in Judaism (just like Zakat is an obligation in Islam), just that they subsume it under a more general (or specific?) principle called Tzedakah:<br><br><blockquote>"Tzedakah" is the Hebrew word for the acts that we call "charity" in English: giving aid, assistance and money to the poor and needy or to other worthy causes. However, the nature of tzedakah is very different from the idea of charity. The word "charity" suggests benevolence and generosity, a magnanimous act by the wealthy and powerful for the benefit of the poor and needy. The word "tzedakah" is derived from the Hebrew root Tzadei-Dalet-Qof, meaning righteousness, justice or fairness. <strong>In Judaism, giving to the poor is not viewed as a generous, magnanimous act; it is simply an act of justice and righteousness, the performance of a duty, giving the poor their due.</strong></blockquote>Note the parts in bold below:  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br><blockquote><br><strong>According to Jewish law, we are required to give one-tenth of our income to the poor.</strong> This is generally interpreted as one-tenth of our net income after payment of taxes. Taxes themselves do not fulfill our obligation to give tzedakah, even though a significant portion of tax revenues in America and many other countries are used to provide for the poor and needy. Those who are dependent on public assistance or living on the edge of subsistence may give less, but must still give to the extent they are able; however, no person should give so much that he would become a public burden.<br><br>The obligation to perform tzedakah can be fulfilled by giving money to the poor, to health care institutions, to synagogues or to educational institutions. It can also be fulfilled by supporting your children beyond the age when you are legally required to, or supporting your parents in their old age. <strong>The obligation includes giving to both Jews and gentiles; contrary to popular belief, Jews do not just "take care of our own." Quite the contrary, a study reported in the Jewish Journal indicated that Jewish "mega-donors" (who give more than $10 million a year to charity) found that only 6% of their mega-dollars went to specifically Jewish causes.</strong><br><br>Judaism acknowledges that many people who ask for charity have no genuine need. In fact, the Talmud suggests that this is a good thing: if all people who asked for charity were in genuine need, we would be subject to punishment (from G-d) for refusing anyone who asked. The existence of frauds diminishes our liability for failing to give to all who ask, because we have some legitimate basis for doubting the beggar's sincerity. <strong>It is permissible to investigate the legitimacy of a charity before donating to it.</strong> </blockquote>Quotes from <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/tzedakah.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewfaq.org/tzedakah.htm</a></div>
