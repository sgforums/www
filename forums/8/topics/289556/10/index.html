Regardless, her story, tells of a kind heart and pure motives in the name of goodness and the god she wanted to believe in. I also think it's so important that she tried and did something significant but fail short, i guess, in god's appreciation of her effort.<br></div>

And yet I think that choice is the choice of an ignorant fool, the easy way in things; that when I contribute to the churches coffer, it mean i am very willing to give.<br><br></div>

In the west, no one dared to criticize her because she was widely regarded as almost a living saint and no one wants to offend the christian right. This public image of mother threasa was created by, what else, television - a show called "Something Beautiful for God."<br><br>Yet one could argue that mother threasa has done a lot of harm. An example can be found in this article.<br><br><a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/200508220019" rel="nofollow">http://www.newstatesman.com/200508220019</a><br><br>As to your statement that you 'would not hesitate to give her your support' because you' had no doubt it will be used wisely, mother threasa received millions of dollars in contributions (which is not surprising considering her exulted status.
