It seems to preach a culture of naked materialism. Its pastor is a businessman who earns lots of money. His wife is a singer who dresses like a harlot with his nipples showing .. How can that represent God or the kingdom of God? Did not Jesus Christ say that it would be more difficult for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God than a camel? Did not St Paul say that women should be pious and listen to their husbands and wear a veil in Church?<br><br>If pastors earn million dollar salaries and encourage their wives to earn million dollar salaries, where is the church headed? To Hollywood? Material values, an obsession with money and wealth and gilded churches is anti-God. Christ came to save sinners from death - and not to encourage them to worship golden calves. That is against Christianity : it is idolatry at its worst in fact.</div></blockquote>Well then that forumer can stay poor all his life. And for your info, the pastor's wife you're talking about is no longer a pastor in that church. She is now obviously an entertainer in the media industry. And it's even more obvious that if she wants to entertain, she gotta be bold enough to take on new roles(why didnt anyone applaud for her boldness to take on new roles then?).<br>Just like in any drama, lets take for example, Chen Han Wei in Metamorphosis as a hot-tempered cop we all know, in real life he's not even a cop!

From young, I was interested in being a Christian, but after encountering the people who attend New Creation, I was so offended by their rudeness and pretensiousness.

            <div class='col-md body'>I just want to comment that to the person who started this forum thread, you probably gt the vision to post this topic from the Devil bah. I mean not in the sense that you are possessed, but in the sense that Devil speak of lies.. and imparted thoughts into you to question and bring up this issue bah. No worries, this is not your fault. ;-)<br><br>I guess, there are pros and cons  in this action BUT certainly it gives christians a chance to explain to you and for you to clarify your doubts.<br><br>In the New testament, God has indicated that he want us to be rich and prosperous. And that the era of living in poverty is over. "(19) I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be[f] bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be[g] loosed in heaven." Matthew 16:19 says it more succintly that Christians will be given the Keys <strong>OF</strong> the Kingdom not just To the Kingdom. To illustrate, if say i only give you the keys to my house, then you can only enter thru my front door and thats pretty much it. But when you have the keys OF my house, you can unlock every safe, every locker and all the treasures and wealth are for you to take. Hence, God does not want us to live in poverty.<br><br>The prosperity u see.. in mega churches be it in their mega reserves or Rich pastors as you proclaim, well.. these are all the blessings and favours of GOD. If you ask me, did they deserve such blessings?  Well the Answer is NO.. they do not deserve it because <strong>Our Daddy God gives us. UNEARNED and UNDESERVING Favors </strong>; just as Jesus .. forgiven and accepted the Prostitutes and the illegal money changer.. these "thugs" were considered scumbag in that era yet, they were the first to be welcomed and fogiven by Jesus.<br><br>As to the issue of tithing, your concern is that these pastors are enriching themselves with these money. Well. firstly, let me explain the meaning of tithing. When we give 10% in tithing, we are acknowledging that our Daddy God is very much alive in our life, and that we want to honor him with the 1st 10% in our reapings.. as he will bless the remaining 90%. In addition, because our Daddy God is such a Great King, he is touched by your 10% and to show his generousity, he will want to give you so much more and he blesses you or the church financially with even more rewards. The giving of the 10% also reminds you that you are not crazily in love in $. The utter addiction and LoVE of $ is the source of Evil.. but... it is different from living in prosperity and abundance. In fact, if you read the biography of Henry Ford, he wanted to proof if tithing would work. Hence, he bought a plot of land of vineyard, harvested the grapes, sold the products and donated 10% of the profits to the local church. And It was awesome, God blessed him with the ability to buy up neighhbouring plots to grow vineyards and progressively.. his profits increased. And also for Christians.. if we have a major investment to make, it would be good to titth 10% of the principal amount to God, so that the remaining 90% will be blessed and be protected by God from all the disturbances crisis or economic downturns. etc etc. That probably explains why Churches have so much reserves in their bank account, or that why.. U see Prosperous CHristians.. be it the pastors or the flocks (i.e. the members).<br><br>If you want to talk about the governance of the tithing money, we are talking about the money reserved for the Kingdom of heaven, for evangelical funding, and community services (yesh. dun be surprised). How the $ is handled, that is between the finance person and God. And there are mega churches which openly displays their accounts and hire professional auditing firms to audit the money. Every single cent is accounted for.. and it is done to satisfy.. the curious demands of folks from the natural world. Hence, i am sure CHC has their own appointed auditing body (one of the big four).<br><br>PS: Pls stop CHC bashing. Especially the attack on Ho. If she is ..against the will of our Daddy God, then is she so blessed in her music career? Why is she getting so much UNDESERVED AND UNMERITED FAVOR? Common, who says a Pastor cannot perform or be an entertainer. That is.. really living in the OLD Testament UNDER the LAW.. Christians are now living in the NEW convenent.. the NEW testament of knowing that.. we have the <strong>Righteousness of God in Christ</strong>, because Jesus died for our past, present and future sins such that we are able to stand right and just beside God and know we are not ashamed to face him because.. Our GOD is just and he has enforced all the punishments on his son Jesus. You know when you realize that you still have the right place and standing with God..and know that you are still loved by our Daddy God.. after you sinned, Would you still want to continue and sin? NO! because you are so moved by Daddy God's love for you.</div>

Well. firstly, let me explain the meaning of tithing. When we give 10% in tithing, we are acknowledging that our Daddy God is very much alive in our life, and that we want to honor him with the 1st 10% in our reapings.. as he will bless the remaining 90%. In addition, because our Daddy God is such a Great King, he is touched by your 10% and to show his generousity, he will want to give you so much more and he blesses you or the church financially with even more rewards. The giving of the 10% also reminds you that you are not crazily in love in $. The utter addiction and LoVE of $ is the source of Evil.. but... it is different from living in prosperity and abundance. In fact, if you read the biography of Henry Ford, he wanted to proof if tithing would work. Hence, he bought a plot of land of vineyard, harvested the grapes, sold the products and donated 10% of the profits to the local church. And It was awesome, God blessed him with the ability to buy up neighhbouring plots to grow vineyards and progressively.. his profits increased. And also for Christians.. if we have a major investment to make, it would be good to titth 10% of the principal amount to God, so that the remaining 90% will be blessed and be protected by God from all the disturbances crisis or economic downturns. etc etc. That probably explains why Churches have so much reserves in their bank account, or that why.. U see Prosperous CHristians.. be it the pastors or the flocks (i.e. the members).<br></div></blockquote>Yes u are correct about the tithe....the 10% is just to show that u are not greedy at all<br>If u can't even give 10% of ur salary,do u still think god can bless you?<br><br>The reason why those pastor has lots of money is because god has bless them in abundance,they have given god something and god has given them back the something in thrice or in quad<br><br>About the money,its being use to send ppl to other countries to spread the word of god,and many other more events that happen in church which the chc member not need to pay,if u guys still don believe,u can ask other chc or ex chc members(correct me if i am wrong)<br><br>Yes,i was quite surprise when chc wanted to build a church in orchard road<br>when they still have a underground church in jurong west and its still quite new<br><br>But if really they are misusing those money,i'm sure god will know and those ppl will get their deserving punishment from god<br><br>But one thing i am sure all of u agree<br>That most of the ppl who go there is just to see girls or vice versa,right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
