            <div class='col-md body'>When I think of sunday church, it brings back memories, the church scene has changed during the past decades, the people that cared for the rich and poor has now turned to movtivation speakers to gathered more members into their mega churches.<br><br>One forummer has this to say:<br><br>City Harvest Church scares me too. It seems to preach a culture of naked materialism. Its pastor is a businessman who earns lots of money. His wife is a singer who dresses like a harlot with his nipples showing .. How can that represent God or the kingdom of God? Did not Jesus Christ say that it would be more difficult for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God than a camel? Did not St Paul say that women should be pious and listen to their husbands and wear a veil in Church?<br><br>If pastors earn million dollar salaries and encourage their wives to earn million dollar salaries, where is the church headed? To Hollywood? Material values, an obsession with money and wealth and gilded churches is anti-God. Christ came to save sinners from death - and not to encourage them to worship golden calves. That is against Christianity : it is idolatry at its worst in fact.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>another forummer critic:<br>I think it is churches that City Harvest that is preaching a perverse message, a gospel of prosperity, which is anti-Christ : and therefore it functions as a 'cult.' much more than the Catholic church. Who does Pastor Kong answer to ? Where does he get all his money? Who audits the City harvest accounts? How does he justify his gospel of prosperity which I cannot even see in the Bible? Why does he allow his wife to dress like some Hollywood star, with baubles and bright lights, with her top bristling with her nipples to titillate males and inspire LUST? He also said in the straits times he is a BUSINESSMAN. Is this not strange? Catholic priests do not have fabulous salaries or pay rises. But all their medical needs are met, and they have an office and a room and a car provided by their church. I think that is the proper way. If pastors are businessmen, they might as well be brokers and join the stock exchange of Singapore.<br><br>And what is all this hard rock band and jumping up and down in church? it sounds more Satanic than righteousness? Is this the justification by faith alone you are talking about - Kiew?<br><br>Are you mad or what? Go for a psychiatric examination please. I bleed for lost souls like you who look at a Bible which had books thrown out by a misguided man, Martin</div>
