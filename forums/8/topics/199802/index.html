            <div class='col-md body'>My family went there last sunday to book a tour to Japan for 4persons. According to the newspaper, there would be free gifts and a discount for persons above the age of 55.<br><br>We were told that there were no free gifts and that the discount did not apply to my specific tour to Hokkaido. Although we quite unhappy, we decide to give some take some and forget about it and we went ahead to book the tour.<br><br>To my surprise, the newspaper today once again advertised free gifts when we were told that they have all been given out. So fast got stock again ah?<br><br>Just 2 days after we book our tour, we had to change the name of a person who was going. They say must pay $250. No discount and free gifts we did not mind but now change name want to charge $250.<br>The air ticket wasn't even booked yet. So we wanted to speak to the manager but the person on the phone say he is busy and will call us back.<br><br>Later the same person on the phone call back and say the manager meeting and he say now the cost is $125. $75 for airline ticket, $50 for Admin fee.<br><br>My dad called his contacts in the travel industry and tell us that it is BS. Ticket not booked no need the $75 but the $50 Admin is needed.<br>Again we got the excuse that the manager is out of office. When we asked about the $75 dollar, she said that she must consult the manager and SLAM the phone down on us...<br><br>I called four to five times throughout the day and the manager is either not around, meeting or really busy.<br><br>I really never expect such poor service from such a reputable Agency even after we spend so much on their tour. They think we really carrot head let them chop. Lucky I got friends in the travel indsutry.<br><br>I just hope to share this experience with others going to Chan Bros so that next time they will not kena such service and waste money for unnecessary surcharges.<br>Rude service, unfriendly after-sales and try to take advantage of our supposedly-stupidness.

            <div class='col-md body'>Last year, I've booked my Taiwan Trip with Chan Brother, also kena bad experience... Their Taiwan Tour Guide was damn rude... and as for their in-house tour guide also no experience... Haiz, came back to Sg was really angry with them... We have made a complaint on them and till date, they have yet to reply us...<br><br>From that incident, it will be my 1st and last time to book my trip with Chan Brother.<br><br>Next time if u wanna book thru agency, try Trade Wind... Their service is so much better although u have to pay slightly more.</div>
