            <div class='col-md body'>A girl in love asked her boyfriend..<br>Girl (g): Tell me... who do you love<br>most in  this world?<br>Boy (b): You, of course!<br>(g): In your heart, what am I to you?<br>(b): The boy thought for a moment and<br>looked<br>intently in her eyes<br>and said,<br>You are my rib. In the Bible, it was<br>said  that God saw that Adam<br>was lonely, during his sleep; God took one of<br>Adam's rib and created Eve. Every<br>man has been searching for his missing rib,<br>only when you find the woman of<br>your life; you'll no longer feel the lingering<br>ache in your heart."<br>After their wedding, the couple had a<br>sweet and happy life for a<br>while. However, the youthful couple began to<br>drift apart due to the busy<br>schedule of life and the never-ending worries of<br>daily problems....their life<br>became mundane....All the challenges posed by<br>the harsh realities of life<br>began to gnaw away their dreams and love for<br>each other... The couple began<br>to have more quarrels and each quarrel became<br>more heated..<br>One day, after the quarrel, the girl<br>ran out of the house.... At the<br>opposite side of the road, she shouted, "You<br>don't love me!"<br>The boy hated her childishness and out<br>of impulse, retorted, "Maybe,<br>it was a mistake for us to be together! You<br>were never my missing rib!"<br>Suddenly, she turned quiet and stood<br>there for a long while.... He<br>regretted what he said but words spoken are like<br>thrown away water, you can<br>never take it back. With tears, she went home to<br>pack her things and was determined in<br>breaking-up. Before she left the<br>house, "If I'm really not your missing rib,<br>please let me go.....<br>She continued, "It is less painful<br>this way... let us go on our<br>separate ways and search for our own partners..."<br>Five years went by....He never<br>remarried but he had tried to find<br>out about her life indirectly...... She had left<br>the country and back.... She<br>had married a foreigner and divorced.....<br>He felt anguished that she<br>never waited for him. In the dark and lonely night,<br>he lit his cigarette and felt the<br>lingering ache in his heart. He<br>couldn't bring himself to admit that<br>he was missing her..One day, they finally<br>met....At the airport, a place<br>where there were many reunions and good-byes....He<br>was going away on a businesstrip. She<br>was standing there alone, with just<br>the security door separating<br>them.She smiled at him gently.<br>(b): How are you?<br>(g): I'm fine. How about you... Have<br>you found<br>your missing rib?<br>(b): No.<br>(g): I'll be flying to New York in the<br>next<br>flight.<br>(b): I'll be back in 2 weeks time.<br>Give me a call when you are<br>back...You know<br>my number... Nothing has changed.<br>With a smile, she turned around and<br>waved good-bye.<br><br>Good-bye.....<br><br>One week later, he heard of her death.<br>She had perished in New York.<br>In the event that shocked the world..<br>Midnight..... Once again, he lit his<br>cigarette..... And like before,<br>he felt the lingering ache in his heart.... He<br>finally knew, she was the<br>missing rib that he had carelessly broken....<br>Sometimes, people say things out of<br>moments of fury..... Most often<br>than not, the outcome could be disastrous and<br>detrimental.... We vent our<br>frustrations 99% at our loved ones.... And even<br>though we know that we ought to<br>"think twice and act wisely", it's often<br>easier said than done. Things<br>happen each day, many of which are beyond our<br>control....Let us treasure every<br>moment and everyone in our lives....Tomorrow may<br>never come; give and accept<br>what you<br>have today.<br></div>
