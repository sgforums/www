              the product she target not profitable since day 1. Never listen..
              Waste money waste time. Study so much also don't know how to
              think.</p>

              <p>For me, study is needed to a certain level to make
              yourself useful will do. And study in the field to make you gain
              the knowledges or skills to ensure you won't be con by those ppl in
              the industries. Is a protection and also is a self
              value.  It all depend on which field you want to be in..</p>

              <p><br>Education makes you forget about the society that bring you up, and when you are successful, you should give back to the society, those CEOs and MDs in the Financial insitutions only think for themselves and to satisfy the shareholders, they forget about the society and the stakeholders, does ending up painting a big picture in their financial statements even when things are not looking pink. In the end, they get high paid, lavishing dinner and oversea first class trips and all those high perks....</p>

              <p>And when things get ballooned and exploded, just like Enron and World.com, who overly stated billions of gain in their account just to find that actually there are billions of lost. Poor peoples and customers will suffer the most, and for the CEOs and MDs, they can just pack their bags, transfer their banks account and enjoy early retirement unless wanted, just like AIA GM here. So, the weak point here is the CEO dun hv to answer to anybody, he/she just lost the job, that is all. With this kind of system, how can you build an entrepreur like me or bill gates??</p>
