But his request was rejected.<br><br>'I was only shown photographs of the stains,' he said.<br><br>Mrs Lee, 30, added: 'It was difficult to tell from those photographs if those were fresh or old stains.<br><br>'We didn't examine the room or carpets for stains when we checked in on our wedding day.'<br><br>Mr Lee showed this reporter a copy of the breakdown of the costs and some photographs given to him.<br><br>The photographs showed small portions of light stains on the carpets and couch.<br><br>The list showed that the carpet was one of the most expensive items, costing $21,360, to replace.<br><br><strong>REQUEST REJECTED </strong><br><br>Other items include fabric for a 2-seater sofa, an arm chair and throw pillows, totalling more than $5,000.<br><br>He added: 'I suggested that a third party inspect the carpets. But my request was rejected.'<br><br>The couple had managed to get a night's complimentary stay in the presidential suite (which cost more than $2,500 a night) through a contact.<br><br>Mrs Lee recalled their wedding night in the suite on 25 Jun last year.<br><br>The financial analyst admitted that her husband was drunk but claimed that he did not vomit.<br><br>She said: 'We went back to the suite with our parents and four to five friends around 11pm.<br><br>'The guys continued drinking in the living room. After midnight, I dragged my husband into the room and we went to sleep.<br><br>'When we woke up around 8am, some friends were still chatting in the living room. We had breakfast and checked out of the hotel.'<br><br>Mrs Lee claimed the room was not left in a mess.<br><br>The couple settled the payment for their wedding dinner before leaving the hotel.<br><br>But they had complained how the wines were initially misplaced and how their names were printed wrongly on some souvenirs and on the notice board.<br><br><strong>CHARGES WAIVED </strong><br><br>The hotel then waived the charges for two tables, totalling $1,776.<br><br>The couple left for their honeymoon in Europe on 27 Jun.<br><br>When they returned on 19 Jul, they heard from a cousin that the insurers of the hotel had been trying to reach them.<br><br>That was when they found out the demand for compensation.<br><br>Mrs Lee said: 'The claim of close to $30,000 is almost eight times my salary. Our wedding dinner already cost us more than $30,000.'<br><br>Mr Lee said he received an e-mail from the hotel about settlement of the claim. He did not hear from the hotel subsequently.<br><br>'We thought that they had decided to close the case.'<br><br>Then, a week before their wedding anniversary this year, Mr Lee received a letter delivered by hand from law firm Rajah and Tann, who is representing United Overseas Insurance, The Regent's insurer.<br><br>Mr Lee said he has since spent more than $1,000 on lawyer's fees.<br><br>In an e-mail to The New Paper, the hotel spokesman said: 'We wish to clarify that it is not the hotel claiming from the couple but its insurance company.<br><br>'The hotel made a claim under its insurance policy and it has been compensated by its insurers for the loss and damage caused by the couple.<br><br>'As the dispute is currently the subject of a pending litigation in court, it would not be appropriate for the hotel to comment further on the insurer's claim against the couple.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Charges only for severe damage</strong><br><br>THEY ask guests to pay for damage to rooms only if it's severe. Even then, they will try to keep the costs low.<br><br>The New Paper spoke to six hotels in Singapore, but only two were willing to go on record.<br><br>Wine and food stains are common problems to hotel housekeeping teams and most of them know how to remove them.<br><br>Said a spokesman for Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel: 'Usually we will shampoo the carpet at our own cost.<br><br>'However, if the damage is major, like burnt carpets, we may have to ask the guests to pay.<br><br>'But we will try our best to keep the cost low. This has never happened before though.'<br><br>Raffles, The Plaza, has no hard and fast rule regarding wine spills on carpets in its rooms, its spokesman said.<br><br>'The needs of our guests come first. Sometimes the stains could be due to wear and tear. We will evaluate on a case by case basis.<br><br>'However, we have not encountered any major incidents where guests damaged the carpets severely.'<br><br>Copyright Â© 2005 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.
