            <div class='col-md body'>irremovable?<br>who was the one that confirm it's irremovable?<br>The hotel replace it bcos they think it's irremovable??<br>What if the couple find a way to remove the stain?<br><br>It's very common thing that we leave soy sauce on restaurant table cloth(I think most of you who went to chinese restaurant have stained the table cloth with soy sauce before), so everytime we leave stain on table cloth they replace it with a new one and charged us saying that it's irremovable??If that's the case we have to bring our own table cloth to restaurant to eat? Or everytime we leave stain on it we have to wash it for them??<br><br>My dad had a bad experience in a hotel in china, let me share it with you all if you bother to continue reading.<br>My dad is quite old, around 60, he was in the hotel room, watching soccer match. He has neck muscle pain, so he applied some "red flower oil" on his neck. He was sitting on the bed, so his neck was not touching anything, but halfway thru the soccer match, he felt asleep, when he woke up next morning, he found stain on the pillow and bed sheet. My dad is in the garment industry, he's quite sure it's removable, so he just leave it there and went out. When he came back later on that day, the stained bed sheet and pillow is folded on the chair, with a billing note of a few hundred RMB. My dad took the pillow case and wash it with the soap in the hotel room toilet, the stain was removed, he use the hair dryer to dry it too. But for the bed sheet, it's too big, my dad cannot wash it in the basin, must wash in the bath tub. But my dad is in 60's, imagine he have to squat beside the bath tub to wash bed sheet???? Then he went down to the counter with the pillow case/bed sheet, with his luggage too, to check out.<br><br>Bcos my dad booked for 4days, but he check out on the 2nd day, so the reception girl ask her why. He reply "I am going to XXXX hotel(another hotel in the city)". The girl knew something must be wrong, so she asked my dad is there any problem about their hotel. My dad show her the pillow case and the bill, the girl examined the pillow case and ask "What's wrong with it?"(My dad already washed it). So my dad replied "YES!! exactly!!!what's wrong?" That poor girl dont know what's happening, so my dad tell her the whole story. She called for the floor manager to come, explained the situation to her. The floor manager knew they were wrong, so she apologized, try to ask my dad to stay, offer him discount on the room stay for the bad mistake they have made. My dad refused to stay, but he talked to the floor manager for a long time. He told her that something done cannot be undone, and he is not there to ask for a discount, that's why he's not accepting the offer to stay.<br><br>This bad service given by the hotel is simply bcos the lady who was supposed to remove the stain didn't do so. She report it to whoever in-charged, report that the stain is irremovable. So whoever in-charged also dont bother to check if it's really irremovable, and just issue the bill to my dad. But my dad proved to the reception girl/floor manager that the stain can be removed by just rubbing the stain with soap in the hotel room toilet.<br><br>My dad pointed out many things to the manager, which she have to agree.<br>"As a customer of the hotel, do we have to solve problems for you?A stain on the bed sheet is a problem to be solved by the staff who's supposed to clean it. This problem should not be pushed to the customer."<br>"If anything found stained, chipped, scratched or spoilt then the customer have to pay for it, then do we have to inspect everything in the room once when we first go in? As a customer, do we have to inspect the things for you?"<br><br>My dad's case may not be exactly the same as the wedding couple's case, but both hotel claims it's irremovable and just replace it, which i think it's not very right.<br><br>Imagine in a car accident, you scratched my car, can i claim the it cant be repaired, so you have to buy me a brand new car of the same model?<br><br></div>
