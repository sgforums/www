Callan said that he exchanged lesser than 5 posts with her, so all we need to do is go through Callan's posts &amp; find who he has exchanged posts with &amp; tallied them up. the problem is sometimes i get distracted &amp; start reading his posts from before my time here &amp; that takes so much time. gosh, his posts are sometimes so long &amp; there's like 333 of it.<br><br>so, what do you think?<br><br>warm regards,<br>colette</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>okay, i can only start tomorrow too or the day after even. want to split the task? i checked (i very kaypoh sometimes) via the search function &amp; found out that Callan has contributed to 146 topics (why can't he just stay to like 40 topics?) in 4 pages, would you want to do the first 2 pages or the last 2 pages? so, what do you say?<br><br>and Callan also said that she seldom visits the forum, that means the forumite shouldn't have too many posts to her name. unless again if Callan is lying, hmmm, i wonder if Callan has seen her before. arghhhh, if only tet will tell us!<br><br>man, i've got to get a life instead of prying into other people's life.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was thinking of not replying to this thread as I thought it would be amusing to see where it would go, but then I am too tempted and could not but recognise the celebrity treatment I am recieving here.*laffs* Now that I have my personal special task force hunting my past posts should I not be proud? But strangely, I am more amuse. Is it not strange to know that someone is actually interested in who you like just for fun? And they can actually take the trouble to dig up all your post for it, I hereby thank the 2 of you for your concern and hardwork. But no, I still would not tell, for I understand that it would be a tough time for her to be the centre of attention, and I would nto want her to go through it. *laffs* But yes, I am still truly amuse.<br><br>Just to answer a few of your doubts, no, I did not lie, Tet does know who she is, but she would not tell, for she wants me to still be her knight, and my clues were all given due, I did not give false clues though I can,for I do not see the reason to lie about who I like, but I just prefer not to tell(reason as above) then lie, it would be disrespectful to her.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Have fun with the search, for it really amuse me.</div>
