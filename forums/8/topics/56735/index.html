"My stomach is all in knots."<br><br>Told she may have to go to court, Brianna's eyes widened behind wire-rimmed glasses and she said, "I'm just shocked that of all the people that do this, I'm on the list."<br><br>The Recording Industry Association of America (news - web sites) said the suits filed yesterday included about 60 that targeted suspects in New York who downloaded more than 1,000 songs.<br><br>The group blames computer users such as Brianna, who use software programs to trade music with others on the Internet, for a 30% drop in music sales.<br><br>Each person sued yesterday could be liable for fines up to $150,000 for each poached track.<br><br>'Appropriate action'<br><br>Experts had predicted a large number of the suits likely would name youngsters.<br><br>"Nobody likes playing the heavy and having to resort to litigation, but when your product is being regularly stolen, there comes a time when you have to take appropriate action," said Carey Sherman, president of the recording association.<br><br>Sherman warned that the group may file thousands more lawsuits against people who use programs like KaZaA, Grokster, Gnutella (news - web sites), Blubster and iMesh.<br><br>Brianna's mother, Sylvia, 40, director of a nurse placement agency, said her daughter was helping her 9-year-old brother with his homework when the Daily News arrived at their apartment on W. 84th St. with word about the suit.<br><br>"For crying out loud, she's just a child," the mother said. "This isn't like those people who say, 'My son is a good boy,' and he's holding a bloody knife. All we did was use a service."<br><br>The mother said she signed up for KaZaA, paying a $29.95 fee. "If you're paying for it, you're not stealing it, so what is this all about?" she asked.<br><br>She said Brianna downloaded music by Christina Aguilera and Mariah Carey, along with the themes to television shows like "Family Matters" and "Full House" - and even the nursery song, "If You're Happy and You Know It."<br><br>"That's really threatening to the music industry," she scoffed.<br><br>"If this was something we were profiting from, that's one thing. But we were just listening and sometimes dancing to the music," said the mother.<br><br>She vowed to get a lawyer to fight the suit, which she termed "ridiculous."

That is of cos, you convert the mp3s from the CDs you own and not for distribution otherwise.<br><br>Sad to say the least, tho they paid for the Ads-Free(likely) option for Kazzaa, they have no rights whatsoever to download copyrighted music...or even any copyrighted materials. I'm not on their side but this piece of news illustrates how much they wanna clamp down on downloaders despite the age.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
