              Anyone remembers Toh Hong Huat and Keh Chin Ann who went missing in 1986? Xin Ming News say they are still alive.
              
              Summary of the article from Xin Ming today:
              
              The ex-husband was said to have taken the two boys to JB, cos he stayed there after divorcing with wife. Previously he had disputes with his ex-wife (Hoong Huat's mother) over the business. Later they got divorce and she asked for alimony which he did not want to give. They speculated he took the 2 boys away out of anger.
              
              The private investigator who reopened the case in 1996 said that back then, Hong Huat's non-biological father had gone to visit Hong Huat's birth mother (who was also residing in Singapore) 1 week before the incident happened. He had asked her if she really doesn't want Hong Huat anymore. The birth mother said that since she had given him away, there's no point in taking him back. Hong Huat's non-biological father said that if that's the case, the birth mother shall not mention Hong Huat is her birth child to anyone anymore.
              One week later, Hong Huat disappeared. The other boy was believed to be implicated (the other boy idolized Hong Huat like an elder brother and would follow him around or go to his home to walk together with him to school).
              
              
              Later the 2 boys were believed to be spotted in JB, Malaysia. In 2004, there was a show on the missing 2 boys. The team actually went to the village to ask about the 2 boys. But the village head turned nasty and were chased away by the village head (or people) there. It looks as if they were hiding something.
              
              They are now 36 and are hooligans/gangsters over there, according to sources.

              <p>not to that stage yet, the most can be charged with evasion of NS but the duo would be eventually be let off,given the circumstances for their disapperance, but still liable for NS if they not yet reach 40. Since they are 36 as stated above, maybe they wait until 40 years old then come back?</p>
