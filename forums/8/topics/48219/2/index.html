Perhaps you can provide me with ample statistics on my next post. Is it ok that you'll advice me where I went wrong on the next post?

I've always been proud of my race, cos in Singapore, everyone i've met has always thought that it was 'cool' being a eurasian, so i've always been accepted into any group, of both races.<br><br>In the local school, people were fascinated when they learnt that i was eurasian, and i had no problems fitting in. I hung out with the chinese peeps with ease. The only difference was that while they conversed in mandarin, i spoke to them in english.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>ANd now in the AUstralian school, i fit in well and my friends are all caucasians or eurasians.<br><br>I've never felt like an outcast before because i'm eurasian, in fact, i've always been rather popular (not trying to boast here). So i am really surprised that your race has had a negative effect instead of a positive one like it has been for me.<br><br>I dont agree that we dont belong anywhere in society. I am an australian citizen, and while my aussie side is more dominant, I still love singapore and i still keep in contact with the friends i made in the local school.<br><br>So basically what i'm trying to say is, maybe u just need more time, and to give ppl more time because not everyone shuns eurasians like u think. Dont let others make u feel like u're lower than them. Hope things work out.<br><br>Cheers love.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Just think that to be born on this earth, you are already the champion of a race with millions of competitors (sperms)for the egg (otherwise a sperm lifespan is at max a couple of days). Also, to be born healthy without physical defects, that chance is even slimmer (things liks chromosomal defects, environmental toxics, malnutritioned, malformation of organs etc).<br><br>And to have survived for decades without life-threatening diseases or mortality and basic necessities provided for, all that kinda chance added up is slimmer than you can ever imagine!!!... In my opinion, striking lottery is so many thousand times easier than what each of us is today. So just you count your blessings on how fortunate you are and what you have turned out to be, regardless of which ethnic group you don't belong or aspire to belong to.<br><br></div>
