And sometimes taxi drivers work 8-12 hours a day, some even more if they drive the taxi on their own only. Some taxi drivers never get to rest, they work 7 days a week for the whole year, no MC (take MC still must pay rental), public holidays still must work, or else those who want to take taxi on public holidays where got taxis to take.<br><br>So, stop complaining lah, taxi drivers everyday sit inside taxi for so long. Any sickness when old, medical fees your tai ji. You think those taxi companies going to pay for you ah?Accident must pay $1000 for what third-party insurance, if investigation the accident not you cause one claim back money must wait so long. Go hospital operation for relief drivers can only claim back the pathetic small sum of money which only is a small percentage of your hospital bills (you can only claim back the money for the bed).  After operation cannot work, where got money? The companies give you? Fat hope!</div>

Go hospital operation for relief drivers can only claim back the pathetic small sum of money which only is a small percentage of your hospital bills (you can only claim back the money for the bed).
