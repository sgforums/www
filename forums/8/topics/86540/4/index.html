While we enjoyed AnimeONE's pursuit of quality, the price came at too high of a cost: stability and timeliness.<br><br>As a result, we have determined that it would be within our best interest to break the joint with AONE and continue to do the series with a staff more dedicated to the project. This is so that we may ensure that we can provide a high quality release of Naruto within a reasonable time frame.<br><br>It is our goal that through this decision, we will be able to release episodes on a consistent basis. We hope you will be supportive of us as we tackle this endeavor, and thank you for your patronage.<br><br>FAQ<br><br>If you haven't found out already, ANBU has decided to terminate the joint with AONE concerning Naruto. ANBU usually doesn't comment on things, but since Naruto is such a popular show, we'll make an exception in this case.<br><br>Q: Why did you split up with AONE on the joint for Naruto?<br>A: Well, I suppose that's the biggest question that everyone has. A simple question, but one which doesn't have a simple answer. Let's start off with some facts. When we started out with Naruto, we worked with certain members from AONE. As time went on, some were replaced. However, in more recent episodes, the turnover rate increased dramatically. It came to a point where we wouldn't know who was timing, typesetting, and sometimes encoding a particular episode.... after the translation and editing had already been completed. I'm not exactly giving away anything, all you need to do is look at the credits for each episode and I'm sure you'll find the timing and typesetting credits changed a lot in more recent episodes.<br><br>This high turnover rate caused many miscommunications and went on until communication was, to put it bluntly, almost nonexistent. All this combined to cause a number of delays in the release of Naruto. Naruto release times began to fluctuate wildly. Sometimes coming out two or three days after airing, sometimes stretching out to seven days.<br><br>We at ANBU wanted more stability and felt this could no longer be achieved with AONE. Hence, we finally decided to terminate the joint with them. Our goal now is to provide a quality episode of Naruto in a reasonable amount of time. When you log on to our website or channel, we would like for you to see "Naruto episode xx released" at the same time of the day. We know how people love to get online, let's say on a Friday, and expect to see "Naruto episode xx released". We want people to say, "Hey, it's Friday! I need to go get Naruto now!" This is our goal.<br><br>(BTW , you have no idea how annoying it can be to see someone coming into the channel and asking, "Is Naruto XX out yet?" or just do a @find Naruto XX when a simple check of the topic/website shows the ep is obviously NOT out yet. It doesn't seem so bad until you factor in the fact thousands of people do this EVERY week. Week in and week out. If you're wondering why some of our rules and ops are so draconian, there's a start right there. Ah, but I digress.)<br><br>Also coming into play was the fact that AONE continues to sub series which are quite obviously licensed. Again, not giving away anything, one look at their projects is all you'll need to confirm this. While we feel they can sub whatever they wish to sub, the ANBU/AONE association has become so interlinked because of Naruto that we are sometimes confused as a single group. Under the circumstances, we felt it was better for all involved parties to have a clean break. That was a rather longwinded explanation, so I hope you got through it all.<br><br>Q: Will you continue to sub Naruto?<br>A: Well, with the release of episode 95-96, I guess that answers that question. That's the short answer. The long answer is that we will continue subbing Naruto until it gets licensed. Seeing as how Naruto could become a piece-meal license, we will continue subbing Naruto if a company announces only a partial license of Naruto. In that case, we'll ask that distribution of the licensed episodes cease immediately.<br><br>Q: Why?! For the love of God, WHY?!?! MY NARUTO FROM ANBU/AONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I've always gotten my Naruto from ANBU/AONE! What'll I do now?!<br>A: Calm down, my friend. We'll do our utmost to bring you a quality episode each week. You can continue getting it from ANBU.<br><br>Q: But it's just not the same to me *sniff*.<br>A: Well, if you are not satisfied, ANBU is not the only group subbing Naruto. You can always get another group's version. We're not forcing you to get our version.<br><br>Not Naruto related...<br>Q: What's up with you doing Ichigo 100%? And why did you start at Volume 9?<br>A: Well, we like Ichigo. Other groups had already done up to Volume 8. So... there you go. Anyway, we're just doing it for fun.<br><br>Posted by: bryantq</div>
