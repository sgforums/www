            <div class='col-md body'>I called Ngee Ann Poly today to ask about a course which I was interested in. It's Chinese Studies, a new course. I'm a polytechnic student from another Polytechnic, therefore I was told that I could not join the JAE. So I was kinda worried that they might require me to sign on with MOE bursaries to become chinese teacher if I got into the course through SAE. But the one who answer me, probably office admin or what said that I could still go through SAE WITHOUT having to go into the teaching track, so I went down to the school to sign up. But when I reached there, I was told that it's a must to sit for MOE interview to get bursaries and SAE is a route to be a chinese teacher.. I was like.. "what the".. I came down all the way from the east to hear this?! Then i dunno whether an admin or a lect came by and tell me that media writing track was for the new O Level holders only. Wth?! I thought this thing must see result and ability one?! Ppl not interested in chinese, you keep so many places for what?! One thing I was most pissed on is that person's attitude. She got this evil look on her face like very "kua suay" ppl one, and summore she asked me to try next yr! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> Please lah, you have this last yr, I wouldnt be where I am also?? Why can't I have a chance? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>I wonder if the course is really popular cos u know nowadays gina dun like studying chinese anymore. From what I see, only china ppl(I'm not being racist, but this is the truth I saw!) making queries on this. Why does the government or school giving chances to them rather than local talents? There's better chinese students out there who are keen to do more chinese stuff too! Doesn't mean you come from china, your chinese is good!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>And somemore, I see china ppl signing up for bursaries.. Man.. this really makes me cringed. This make me relates it with the other incident where a china student come here to study on our own gov's sponsorship and still scold our local student pig -_- Please lor! Not as if they'd stay here forever to slog for you, worse still at most they pay you back the money later and left for some other places to teach or what. It's doesn't matter to them if they leave a bad record here cos they could always go back to China. Why must the gov raise other country's kids for them???  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

Truly, you shld see her expression and the tone she used. She jus seems to reject ppl flat. -_- The student helpers were really nice, they did it all out to get me more information to find out ways for me to get in. I really appreciate that. But since students nowadays doesn't really like chinese, I was wondering why they reserved all the places for freshies where you actually is grooming more china students. -_- <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
