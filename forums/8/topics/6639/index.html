            <div class='col-md body'>Aaargh! Finally!!!<br><br>I've been a Lakers fan since the early 80s, when Houston had their Twin Towers and Dennis Johnson was a guard with the Celtics. Rememer Goodrich? No? Cos he was the instrumental in getting James Worthy and complete the Kareem/Magic/Worthy triple threat. So it is with relief that this is their breakthrough season after so many could bes and may bes. Yeah!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Kobe/Shaq/Rice...!!!! I always like Fox cos he reminded me of Worthy (a bit lah)... calm steadying play with hot flashes... but he's not so good now.<br><br>Sorry, I just dun buy the Micheal Jordan crap, cos the greatest basketball figure can be anyone (Chamberlain, Russel, Bird, Magic) because he was functioning in a watered down league in his ascendency and has no political convictions besides making money. Recently, he was asked why he didn't support the Democrat ticket (Bradley no less) and his reply was that "Republicans buy my shoes too". On the other hand, Bird/Magic revitalised unselfish team sport and ressurected the sombulent basketball in the 80s.<br><br>To be fair, he is the ultimate basketball machine. I will say he is the best to ever play basketball but he unfortunately did little for the league. The amazing thing abt MJ is that he always found ways to improve. When he came into the league in 1985, he was primarily a slasher and an acrobatic dunk. Then by the time the Bulls beat the Pistons to be Conference champs, MJ was mastering the jumper. Then came the 90s and the introduction of Tex Winters and triangle offence. I cannot help but drop my jaw when he got those consecutive three-pointers in the Finals against Drexler's Portland. And all those clutch shots. Wow!<br><br>As for the Vince Carter/Kobe Bryant comparison, I think Kobe is a better all round player at this point. His assists and ball handling has improved to the point that his assist to turnover ratio is now 4:1 when last year was barely 2:1. Toronto Raptors has a good shot as a dark horse for the Eastern Conference ... if they were up against a slow team like the Pacers in the first round, they will be a shoo-in for the second, and if that went their way, Conference finals! But the champion is from the West. Lakers in 6 over Blazers in the Conference Finals!<br><br>Well, I hope to hear more from people, as it's so sad that NBA doesn't get a mention anymore.<br><br>cheers.<br><br>------------------<br>It doesn't mean that love always has to obey Mariah Carey ...

            <div class='col-md body'>Cool..Barclays...<br><br>Well as I am always a Jordan fan since he is the one actually first inspired me to play bball...I am always also fascinated how he actually bring the whole team to be united...I still remember inthe earky 90s...where John Paxon got the last 3 pointer shot and win for the chicago bulls vs Phoeinix Suns..where Charles Barkley is stil in Suns....<br><br>Kobe yeah..a great potential player...and well..when Ihave finished the party...I will come back for more...<br><br>So do u play bball too?point guard or forward?I play shooter and forward....wonder if any of u are in a team for competitions or play for leisure?As for me, I only played once in civic plaza on 3 on 3..but I dun really like to play competitively...cos after the bad experience with the gals on 3 on 3...maybw competition os not for me..( cos they are much toomrough and fouled me everytime)...Damn!<br><br>------------------<br>Writing is a weapon that is more powerful than a man's fist.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Alrite! My fav topic.....<br><br>1st of all....MJ.....wow...he's defintely outta this world....ever so dramatic.....his legend is the most beautiful of all......getting every imaginable award, winning NBA titles coming outta retirement, knocking down 6 3-pointers in the finals, iced the game winner against Utah in Game 1 Finals 1997, pouring in a 37 point effort in the same series despite being down with virus, 1st player to get a triple double in an NBA All-Star game, and the final game winner in the 1998 finals.....wow...the list is endless...<br>but one thing.....u guys remember his last shot over Bryon Russell? Did MJ shove him outta the way? I heard from an interview with BR, and it was indeed the case.....that should be an offence of foul!<br><br>Of course, Magic is one of my favs as well....those magical passes.....how I wish I could do that.......though I hope he doesn't do that with his virus......he's the most beautiful player ever.....<br><br>Coming to the present....well I guess there's no particular era to speak of....unlike the 80s, dominated by Celtics and Lakers......neither is there any really dominant player like Chamberlain, Kareem etc.....a lot of young talent though....Carter, Stephon Marbury, Iverson, Jason Williams....<br><br>Vince and Williams are defintely the most creative players I have ever seen, but Vince kinda arrogant huh? and I agree he lags in his all around game....Williams is shaky with his shooting too.......<br><br>don't like Shaq though.....and I think other NBA players also think similar......always ass his way in using his gigantic proportions for a easy shot or just pounce to the hoop often flattening his poor opponents....think he's an ugly player...<br><br>my fav player in the league now has to be Chris Webber, well...he's the guy who can provide steady points for you......20 points, 10 rebounds....no problem....and he can pass well too.......thats why I'm rooting for the Kings...although they don't have much of a chance I think for this year.....<br><br>And finally...my bball career!<br><br>been playing since secondary school days.....Dunman High....can't really survive there if u don't know the basketball.....and then Temasek College.....basketball school as well........as a 1.78m 'giant'...usually I play small forward as in Scottie Pippen...don't like to post up.......but love to crash for the boards, make those assists, take jumpers and tip in shots....<br><br>Career Highlights:<br>I'm sorry but tis I really like to share which was the memorable moment of my basketball career.....<br><br>was serving NS that time and there was this intra camp match.......1st match.....<br><br>My team was made up of my recruits and me(was an instructor training BMT recruits)..<br><br>The game started without me cos I had a  stomachache and had to take a shit...(thought it would be better than to bring it on the field)....<br><br>When I was fielded....we were trailing.....but soon we rallied behind some hot shooting(yes...mine)....but at the end of regulation we were tied! At the end of the overtime, we were still tied! So we had to end it the fast way.....taking penalty shots!(mind you this is no NBA).<br><br>So 3 players from each team came fwd to shoot the free throws, and all 6 of us missed!<br><br>Weird.<br><br>One more time.<br><br>All 6 of us scored.<br><br>Damn it.<br><br>To resolve this impasse, the co-ordinator's way was to flip a coin, to select a player from either team to shoot the free throw. Scoring it will win the game and VV.<br><br>"Heads", I said.<br><br>And it was heads.<br><br>So I calmly walked up and took the shot before almost a crowd of my hundred recruits and other staff.<br><br>Nothing but the net.<br><br>And the crowd erupted into a frenzy, cheering and congratulating.<br><br>That was really my moment.<br><br>**********************************<br><br>[This message has been edited by Axl (edited 18 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Vince Carter a <strong>fluke</strong>? I didn't know you need luck to have that kind of vertical leap..heh heh<br><br>Personally I like the following players:<br>Vince Carter - got the attitude and can play the game. Awesome power in his dunks.<br><br>Kobe Bryant - another one similar to Vince, also has the right attitude and approach. Entertains me all the time. His jump-shot is improving all the time though. Both he and Vince will rule.<br><br>Kevin Garnett - Keep reading in mags he's the best all-rounder. Oh well he's so damn tall for a small forward you won't argue too much with him.<br><br>Latrell Sprewell - Bad boy but he's got game. Did not really care how many coaches he choke, as long as he keeps driving. Without him and Allan Houston The Knicks wouldn't have reached the finals last year.<br><br>Grant Hill - Best one-on-one player. Has many a "driving license" and goes past defenders so easily. The type of no-talk all game player I admire also.<br><br>Jason Williams - as Singaporeans would say "Pattern liao liao" . I like watching Sacramento as he is not afraid to do all the amazing passes and moves even if it fails occasionally. Not a Man U fan, me, but he's sort of the Cantona of NBA.<br><br>As you all would have found out I prefer entertainers to workhorses like Duncan, Malone and Payton although they always get the work done.<br><br>--------------<br>"If you could reach higher"<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Say, you people seem to focus more on offensive stuff, players and sorts, but how many of you out there like the defensive element of the game? the thrill of blocking a shot is ten times as much as scoring, i must say.  alonzo mourning, bill russell and co. are my type, and say, we could all get together for a ball game some time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yah.....love Rodman.......<br><br>Sometimes his defensive plays are more spectacular than Jordan's offensive barrage.....the way he draws offensive fouls against Malone really drives the crowd into a frenzy......and that really got the momentum going...and the morale shooting up...<br><br>thats rite...rejecting opponents shots gives the most satisfaction the game can offer....esp when u hammer it onto the backboard......makes ur presence felt..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ha! Been watching NBA for many years already... but hv to apologise that I only watch Lakers games and the Finals. Usually skip all other "LIVE" matches...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>As TV coverage was still quite low many years back in the late 80s and early 90s, I didn't really hv a chance to watch Lakers very much.<br><br>And now that there are more TV coverage, I still can't catch too many games becos of the time diff... damn... I usually catch the latest scores fm thre NBA website in office...  :p<br><br>Fav player... dun really favour any particular players. I support the team, whoever plays for lakers get my support. Used to like Eddie Jones a lot, but he was traded to Hornets. Currently, my fav is Kobe.<br><br>------------------<br>Whens the end coming? Like asif I care.....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well , i used to support Chicago Bulls last time because of Jordan . Jordan is truly an amazing player to watch esp. his clever fade away jumper . The best are still Jordan , magic Johnson , Larry Bird and Abdul Jabar . There are so much changes in NBA these days and currently , i am into the Indiana Pacers because they are an exciting team to watch with lots of good players . I don't think the Raptors and Grizzlers have their chance this season . I think this season's final will be The Pacers v.s L.A Lakers . What a match !!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Indiana vs Lakers in the final?  Did u see the last match up they had?!?  Man, but I've always loved Jalen Rose's game before he even got to play for Indiana.  What can I say, the Lakers OWNs man!!  I've been a Lakers fan eversince the Magic era and wow, I'm still loving em, if not, more now!!  Especially with the addition of Phil Jackson now, I would say the Lakers team are rather complete.  AC Green, you should retire.  HAHA<br>CHECK OUT PORTLAND'S BENCH!!!!  Man!!!  Bonzi Wells, Detlef Schrempf, Greg Anthony, Jermaine O'Neal, Brian Grant, Clyde Drexler (haha)...I think they will meet up with Lakers in the western conference finals.  Sorry Spurs fan...I never liked a Big Man's game...though watching Kevin Garnett play is ridiculous!!  He can shoot the damn trey like Arvidas Sabonis!!  Favourite player?  That's gotta be Kobe "jellybean" (haha) Bryant.  Haha, ok, so showboat Kobe ain't as smooth as papa Joe here, but can he shake and bake.  His crossover is so friggin low to the ground for a 6-7er!!  And boy can he stuff the ball well and drain the shots (okok, enough abt the airballs in Utah).  I'd love a Vince Kobe match up...or just see Kobe shut down Iverson, boy does he love running after the small guys.  Why does everyone hates Shaq man!!  He's so cute!!  bwahaha  Right now in the NBA, he's definitely the most dominating player in the league. Check out big 61 on his birthday, DAMMMMMMMMMMN!!  No one can stop him on a one on one like nobody can stop me on a one on one... hAHAhahha  Rookie of the yr?  Steve Francis.  Told U, i don't like big mens' game, Sorry Elton!  WTF happened to Lamar Odom?  I thought Andre Miller is gonna be another college hero, NBA zero coz of his size and height, but he's proving me so wrong, =)  My all-star team : Shaq, Malone, Garnett, Kobe and Stockton.  what do you guys pick?<br>My Bball bio ain't that fantastic...hey Axl, that game of yours is really funny  haha...but i bet that's GOTTA be the moment for U =)!  my bball bio isn't flashy, played in sec sch team, played ivp for yr 1 n yr 2, now just play recreational.  Hope to have a game with u guys one day  =).  FINALLY...THE ROCK HAS COME BACK TO SINGAPORE!!  rock meaning "basketball", not that jabroni!  i'm out!</div>

I'm on ur team if we're playing together! So which U are u from?<br><br>Well my dream team has to be Iverson, never seen such a small guard exert so much dominance on the court, Vince Carter and Chris Webber.....man in the middle...Alonzo Mourning, gotta have the defense there....Jason Kidd will complete the team.....shoot, pass, rebound nothing he can't do.....</div>

Seeing them retire &amp; leaving the team wasnt nice at all... Lucky now theres are still many young talents like Grant Hills !!!<br><br>By the way... anyone interested in playing together one fine day ??? We can take it as an outing. A Basketball outing. Julius &amp; I were planning to play together for fun for some times.. but seems like we are lack of participates...<br><br>Well... Interested parties can simply post here &amp; we will see what we can come up with.<br>As for Rinoa... We are still waiting for ya to come back to sg to play with us !!!!<br><br>Cheerios !!!</div>
