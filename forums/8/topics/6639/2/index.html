            <div class='col-md body'>go the Lakers!  a view fo the coming 4 months:  the Lake show will rule the west, and come june, they shall rule both conferences!!!  seriously, i don't see anyone who can match it up with the Lakers, apart from the Blazers and the (once mighty) Jazz. and Shaq qill be MVP this season, and he'll also take the scoring title, instead of Allen "i take almost 30 shots a game and i only make a a quarter of them and plus i don't pass to my team-mates, oh, and i also create 4 TOs per game" Iverson.  the Lakers will humiliate the Heat to bring the title back to LA.  anyway, Penny will ask for a trade to the Lakers to be re-united with Shaq, and the Lakers will release some bench players and some future Draft picks...i better stop here  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>anyway, everyone has been talking about Vince Carter lately, so i would like to give a piece of my mind...<br>people will probably label me as a Vince-hater after reading this, but here goes.  first of all, let me just say that Vince Carter deserves the praise that he's receiving.  after all, he helped turned the Toronto Raptors, an expansion franchise going nowhere with a bunch of second-hand (potential) talents, into a competitive and respectable team this season.  not only they are winning games, but they're doing so on a regular basis, with consistency, and as a result, they're going to the playoffs for the first time in the history of the franchise, and i would like to think that they would be more than a handful for most, if not all, teams in the east.  but regarding his comparisons to MJ, well, that's quite expected, i suppose the fact that Vince was a Tar Heel and the fact that they both have this incredible talent to dazzle and entertain billions of people around the globe, are not to be dismissed.  but do we really need another "Next MJ"?  look what happened to Harold Miner (i can imagine the blank expressions on people's faces), or maybe Isaiah Rider?  or how about Grant Hill? in Grant's case, he's been successful in his effort to remove that tag and carving his own niche in the NBA as a premier player of his own.  the simple fact is, there is only one MJ, and there will never be another MJ.  the same goes with Bill Russel, or Wilt Chamberlain, or Oscar Robertson, or George Gervin, or Jerry West...every single one of them achieved their legendary status because they were unique talents...they are legends in their own respective ways.  you don't measure a guy's talent by comparing him to another person's achievements.  Vince Carter has the potentials to be a legend of his own in the NBA, but until that day comes, he's just gonna have to keep throwing those amazing and in-human dunks and also to work on his fadeaway js...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, i agree with pluckduck there's only one MJ and i forgot abt one guy's UserName above, but yes, i noticed too, that Jordan is indeed NBA's finest in such a way that he actually perfected his turnard/fadeaway jumpshots after knowing he ain't a vince carter at 30+ yrs old.  Knowing how to change and adapt to a style of game pertaining to age is something not easy to do, especially when u take so much pride like Jordan to stuff it in Mutombo's face...wait, he did it when he was over 30 still right?  haha *wags finger after dunk*<br>WOOOOOO haha.  Hope Iverson can do likewise like his Airness when he's aging...no more ankle breakin crossovers or he might break his own.<br>Hey, any NCAA fans out there??  For me, i've always been a Duke fan, why?  Coz i can never remember Mike Kryzewski's (or however u spell his name) name right!  HAHAHAHA<br>Dick Vitale rules man...haha<br>I'm out!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just some random thoughts after going through all the posts  :p<br><br>1) Shaq-daddy... well, yeah, I read that some posters feel that he's a big bruiser down the paint and all that jazz and I say this : YES, I agree with you that was the Shaq we know and hate from his Orlando days and his early Lakers career. BUT, he has improved tremendously this year, and for once, he is dominating both ends of the court. Get this, he is now a COMPLETE post player and not just a back-you-down, and lean-to tip in kinda shots. He is passing, he is blocking, he is getting his own bloody rebounds (which incidently was how I felt when he asked for Rodman to do the dirty work for him). He is MVP this year, period. I dun care for scores so I usually ignore scoring titles.<br><br>2) I seem to be taking the piss against the popular players here : I diss the current form of Jason Williams. I totally agree with someone who laughingly called him "pattern leow leow" ... true, very true ... otherwise why will Adelman bench him in tight games in the fourth quarters?! Cos he is a defensive liability and opposing point guards know that. Until he wise up, he will be a second-tier NBA guard, irregardless whether his jersey is the most popular merchandise.<br><br>3) What do you think of Laimbeer coming back as coach of Pistons? I wonder how the Bad Boy is gonna gell with the Gentleman of NBA, Mr Hill himself. Frankly, Dumas should suit up and they will actually win two or three more games.<br><br>4) Isiah Rider's poison! I doubt any sensible team will have the gumption to take him on. In the long run, he'll be a fat-contract overrated and troublesome player like Rod Strickland in Wizards.<br><br>5) Rambling on further, my rookie of the year pick is Lamar Odom. Elton Brand is steady but lacks the fire of Odom who seems to go on a personal crusade whenever he takes the floor. Even though he fades away at close games, he can still give the rest of the team certain offensive intensity. God knows the Clippers need it.<br><br>6) I watched Garnett sink treys recently and my jaw dropped. A 7ft guy who plays at SF, who the heck can guard him?<br><br>Keep this thread going!?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>hi-fives<br><br>------------------<br>Now I've swung back down again<br>It's worse than it was before<br>If I hadn't seen such riches<br>I could live with being poor<br><br>---  "Sit Down" James</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Axl,<br><br>Call me unexcited but Carter at this point is really just flash. I'll adopt a see-and-wait attitude. Regarding Googs, he's really one of the elite PFs in the league ; remember the Stephon Marbury trade? Wolves traded Googs to keep Steph and that all turned to bust. He's not gonna crack into the All Star starting lineup but he's there as a second tier star.<br><br>Anyway, the BIG news is that Jason Kidd broke his ankle. *gasp* Forget Phoenix chances at making it past Round One of the playoffs. Now the killer news ... Suns hired Kevin Johnson as a replacement!? Man, he's coming out of retirement! Sure, he's old at 34 but I'm sure the Suns can use his hardnosed defence and his career avg assist of 7.somthing.<br><br>cheers<br><br>------------------<br>Welcome to the Afterlife Voice Mail System.

Another Chris Gatling?  *starts rapping "I am KG"*  Steph's the man, just wondering why on earth the Nets are still losers with Van Horn, Kittles, Gill, Steph and Williams.  *shakes head*  I'm more excited to see Carter play together with Ray Allen and see whether they'd rather shoot the ball than pass it to each other.  But i doubt they'd play together at the same time as they both fill up the 2 spot right?  Steve Francis for Rookie of the yr!!!  UCLA to win NCAA!!!  Shaq to win MVP!!!

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey hey...seems like the hottest news is Carter being in the US dream team in the Sydney Olmpics...and he seems to be getting all the attention.Carter will get a lot out of being part of the Dream Team. HeÂ’ll see from being with his peers how hard they work and how deep their commitment runs. Remember, Carter is at a very embryonic stage of his career. He himself doesnÂ’t know how good he is and being with the best is the chance of a lifetime. Only good can come from rubbing elbows with these guys. HeÂ’ll see firsthand the hard work of Kevin Garnett and the discipline of Tim Duncan. And not that Carter is lacking in confidence, but this will give him so much more confidence.<br><br>Oh anyone knows or speculate why Shaq is not in the dream team?<br><br>Kobe<br>Sure, organise one cool game and we will see who are the cream of the crop in this forum and I will be back in May till end of June...so anytime within that period...<br><br>Damn!Am I the only female here in this 'guy' sports....*croons for Indiana for woman's NCCA*<br><br>------------------<br>Writing is a weapon that is more powerful than a man's fist.</div>

So its kinda of, he doesn't need that publicity anymore. So maybe, they want the globe to see more of their younger, more exciting stars...e.g Vince Carter.<br><br>Their main focus would be to leverage on the Olympics global appeal to generate as much publicity, goodwill about NBA, so that they can sell more merchandise, 'cos they can win the gold with any Tom, Dick and Harry in the NBA.<br><br>I think.</div>

I mean, what impresses me more than flying dunks and "passes off the elbows" are 1) the ability to make ur teammates better and 2) always improve on your game.<br><br>That's why I loved Bird and Magic. To me, Shaq has done both this year. Jordan was the same. (I still hate him for his material/political stance *laugh*) Shaq is more than just a big body in the paint ; c'mon, if you want a big body, you'll use Big Country Reeves and he's actually bigger than Shaq. But Reeves is a complete flop, compared to the Shaq-daddy.<br><br>Again, I'm only defending him THIS year cos he really was rather one-dimensional in his early years.<br><br>cheers.<br><br>------------------<br>Welcome to the Afterlife Voice Mail System.

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh man...2 more days to the Final Four!!  Woooooooooooooo  i can't wait man!!  Watched the Tar Heels/Golden Hurricanes match up and got juiced by again, Forte.  Anyone saw the buzzer beater he put up against Duke abt a mth ago?  He can shoot the ball well for a Carolina.  (okok, Jordan and Carter too alright? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">)  I gotta feeling that the Gators won't make it past Tar Heels, like they got stopped by Duke in '94, the only time they reached the Final 4 in sch history too.  The Spartans will trample over Badgers and win the championship over Tar Heels.  My prediction.  Anyone else think alike?  Or does anyone else follows NCAA at all?  For women...don't really quite follow, but i do know it's Connecticut/Penn State and Tennessee/Rutgers.  Keep this thread going guys!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wah seh Ko6e, u really the hard core man, college bball also monitor so closely. Sorry U don't share ur enthusiasm for college bball cos<br>1. The quality of broadcast and video pales in comparision to NBA<br>2. I don't even know one player in the league<br>3. The commentators are lousy, prefer Mark Brown and John Spencer.<br><br>Actually I'm really itching from head to toe for some bball action 'cos I have not touched a bball for weeks, 'cos of the %&amp;^&amp;%^@$% rain! But find it weird to be playing with forumnites....hehe....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah i agree with U Axl that NCAA isn't popular at all in Singapore.  Well, for me, i find NCAA basketball interesting to watch also as they press more and play zone defence, unlike NBA where it'll be an illegal defence.  Quite sucky huh...  That's why we get to see Iverson break down someone so easily, or Carter dunkin on someone's sorry ass so often.  Don't think it'll be that easy with zone defence, but it's definitely a wee bit easier with man to man defence.  I guess the fun part abt watching NCAA is knowing the players and actually seeing them go to the NBA.  Draft day is definitely a fun event to watch if u know the players and how good their chances are of getting a high pick and which team they'd go to.  I remember watching Keith Van Horn, Ron Mercer, Iverson, even Austin Croshere playing in college and to see them all playing in the NBA and how their game changes makes the NCAA a much more interesting channel to the NBA.  And also...seeing the students cheer em on only reminds me of how sucky sch spirit and bball attention in singapore is.  Dick Vitale rules man...says who NCAA has dormant commentators!!  :p  Anyone reads SLAM/Beckett or XXL?<br></div>
