            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by stupidissmart:<br><br>SO ? Tat doesn't mean perfection being or matter will exists ? The earlier arguments u r mentioning about the existence of a perfect being JUSt because we realise men r not perfect. I say the handphone is too heavy, and the perfect weight for handphone is 0 grams. IS there a weightless handphone ? I can say tat the perfect power consumption for a TV is zero. Is there a TV tat do not take in any power ? Perfection is an IDEA. Whether it exists or not is another thing. Defining perfection for certain attributes is easy. But it is unlikely tat it will exists.<br></blockquote>if u do not know existence of perfection then how do u know imperfection?<br><br><blockquote><br>U claim tat there is a perfect being, it is your responsibility to show it. Otherwise anybody can claims everything. I can claim tat god is a purple hippo. Why don't u proof it to me tat he is not ? U r not perfect either so how can u prove it to me ?<br></blockquote>wad do u think is perfect? wad do u base your standards of perfection on?<br>do u think ur standard for perfection is perfect?<br><br><blockquote><br>Ahhh... but then doesn't tis apply to god too ? Animal A r not perfect, so does matter B. U can interpolate all the matter in the universe or living creatures and none of them r perfect. So by mathematical inductions, there is no such things as a perfect being thus religon is all bull.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>Lets define from a dictionary:<br><br>Belief in and reverence for a supernatural power or powers regarded as creator and governor of the universe.<br><br>A personal or institutionalized system grounded in such belief and worship.<br></blockquote>i got my definitions from the dictionary too. we're arguing on different lines<br><br><blockquote><br>Personally I just want to emphasis on the word supernatural<br>So wat r u trying to say here ?!?! Politics hold powers on how a group of people behaves by setting laws. If a religion turns out to be against the policies of the politicians they get to be eradicated and discouraged by the authorities. U can easily see such influences from the latest falungong incidents<br><br></blockquote>point is?<br><br><blockquote><br><br>Can u say tat everything in the world is invented by people who must have good intentions ? Some of the inventions just meant tat the inventor want to earn a money from it or it is meant to kill people. Is the inventor of machine guns and tanks necessary righteous or evil ? Not necessary, such things is random. There is a possibility tat the inventor of paper is an evil, good or normal person. SO does the creator of the universe. Who says tat he must be a being who must necessary perform good deed and not evil ?<br>Com'on, even the christian scripture segregate people into believers and non -believers during judgement day. Christian believes in a god tat destroy many civilisation because they have a different religion too. Muslim also have doctrines tat support muslim to band together and support other muslim brothers if they r prosecuted. Isn't tat a clear sign tat the religion itself supported segregation. These r all mentioned in the scriptures, not people. These r obvious flaws with the system.<br></blockquote>i nv talked about creation of the universe in any sense. I was arguing about the existence of a perfect being.<br>the case for segregation is based on people. yea i might be overly optimistic. i cant expect u to share my views rite? not even if i'm ready to accept urs.<br>btw who wrote those scriptures?<br><br><blockquote><br>If u say tat religion doesn't segregate people, then u r probably over optimistic. Even in discussion on religion here, there is already a clear sign of some segrergation between the people. The freethinker and the religious. In fact there is a forum meant for christians to discuss in sgforums (eternal hope). Isn't tat another sign of segregation ? Wat is the fact now ? Has it cause segregation ?<br></blockquote>i'm a buddhist btw...doesnt answer the part all.<br><br><blockquote><br>IMO, u should stop telling us how ideal men should perform. We should focus on how normal man react when faced with the system of religion. If everyone r ideal men, they won't need a religion anyway. Normal men abuse the system of religion, and they abuse it more easily and create more harm than the benefits from it.<br><br></blockquote>humans r the source of the errors rite? even u admit it.<br><br><blockquote><br>Sorry man, the system of religion create a flawed system tat make abuses extremely easy. It is human error tat make such abuses, but the system r so prone to such errors tat it shouldn't it be "revised" ? It is like not giving operator of construction workers any safety devices when they r handling dangerous work. When they r injured, it is all human errors too. Can we really blame them ? Shouldn't the design or system be improved so there r less injuries ?<br></blockquote>humans once again rite?<br>who designed the system?<br><br><blockquote><br>I never say tat religion is the cause of all conflicts. I am saying tat it is the cause of much conflicts. Will the crusaders start without religion ? Will there be conflicts between isrealis and palestinains if there is no religion ? Will there have 911 attacks if there r no religion ? Throughout history u see many conflicts just because of religion too. U can't discount tat it created more conflicts by making the organisation for conflicts easier.<br></blockquote>i'm starting to wonder if u've read my post carefully...<br>i tot i agreed wif that point already<br><br><blockquote><br>Ahhh... but then doesn't tis apply to god too ? Animal A r not perfect, so does matter B. U can interpolate all the matter in the universe or living creatures and none of them r perfect. So by mathematical inductions, there is no such things as a perfect being thus religon is all bull.<br><br>BTW, wat does your earlier argument state ? U say tat since human realise tat they r imperfect, therefore they know wat is perfection and thus there should be a perfect being. ISn't tat totally wrong ? The analogy on the pig still hold, since knowing wat is perfect doesn't mean a perfect being must exists; Knowing wat is flying like doesn't mean pigs can fly. </blockquote>the last paragraph was a joke. u dun get it? i got bored...<br>if u want to lump em together aren't u equating perfection to men?<br>knowing something is imperfect means that there is something perfect to base their judgement on and since their judgement is imperfect then it must come from a perfect being?<br>an imperfect being cannot have judgement on perfection.<br>do u agree on the last statement?<br><br>[/quote]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>if u do not know existence of perfection then how do u know imperfection? </blockquote>As said many times before, perfection is an idea, and we can know perfection as the highest state of improvement tat can ever be made. I know wat is the perfect weight of handphone, which is weightless. I do not see a perfectly weightless phone around but I can still know wat is the ideal weight isn't it ? Why must it be in existence first ? If we need an existent object before we can make any improvement, then human society won't make any improvement.<br><br><blockquote>wad do u think is perfect? wad do u base your standards of perfection on?<br>do u think ur standard for perfection is perfect? </blockquote>All these is just trying to confuse people. Mine just follow the definition of dictionary. No room for any improvement. I am not going to say my definition is perfect, but it is generally accepted by society. So u finally realise tat asking me to prove tat god does not exists is not fair ?<br><br><blockquote>I nv talked about creation of the universe in any sense. I was arguing about the existence of a perfect being.<br>the case for segregation is based on people. yea i might be overly optimistic. i cant expect u to share my views rite? not even if i'm ready to accept urs.<br>btw who wrote those scriptures? </blockquote>No, u r just telling me tat religion must teach people good, which I do nto really agree. I view religion as a history book telling us the truth and the past events tat had happened. And as a history book, it would not tell us tat the founder of civilisation or creator of the universe is definitely a good person.<br><br>Who wrote those scriptures. Human. BTW I am a freethinker.<br><br><blockquote>i'm a buddhist btw...doesnt answer the part all</blockquote>Tat part tell u tat religion is a system tat segregate the people. I am sure muslim and christainity are establish religion system and they have taught peopel to segregate.<br><br><blockquote>humans r the source of the errors rite? even u admit it</blockquote>A good system has to take into account human errors. Tat is why the political system now generally prevent abuse from people. Religion is not. It is a failed or outdated system.<br><br><blockquote>humans once again rite?<br>who designed the system? </blockquote>As said before, human is going to be the leader of the organisation. Abuses from such leaders is easy. Tis is because the religion system is flawed. No one is going to be the leader of a religious organisation other than human isn't it ?<br><br>It is like saying tat u r asked to make a system designed for a person with IQ above 120. But the finished end product cannot be used by people with IQ above 120. The system cannot be used by the people it is designed for. Doesn't tat show tat there is a serious system flaw in the system ?<br><br><blockquote>the last paragraph was a joke. u dun get it? i got bored...<br>if u want to lump em together aren't u equating perfection to men?<br><br>knowing something is imperfect means that there is something perfect to base their judgement on and since their judgement is imperfect then it must come from a perfect being?<br><br>an imperfect being cannot have judgement on perfection.<br>do u agree on the last statement?<br></blockquote>No. Why should perfection be equating to men ? I totally disagree with your statement tat knwoing something is imperfect meant tat I have something perfect to fall on to. How do I know if it is not perfect ? Simple. I just find a possible area where it can improve on and if it is true, then it is not perfect anymore. A bird cannot live forever. If it can live forever it certainly beats living for just 10 years. Therefore it is not perfect. Do I need another perfect being as a  comparison ? NO. An imperfect being can have judgement on perfection. Even a kid knows how to state a possible improvement to any system or being.<br><br>I am joking too, do u see the laughing face at the end of my earlier paragraph ?<br><br></div>
