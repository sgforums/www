If u take it that it involves the control over ALL aspects of the people of the society, then religion is politics. If u take it as wad we usually take it as in the garmen is responsible for this and that and who cares wad u believe as long as u pay your taxes and stay outta trouble... religion is NOT a political system. Religion would still be a system, keep in mind that though.<br>btw no one knows for sure whether the universe was created or not.<br>so u went out of point there. Thomas Edison invented the light bulb with good intentions. the light bulb was a product of good intention. Nobel invented trinitrotoluene (TNT) with good intentions too (blast open the mountains to build tunnels) but others took it and use it as a weapon. Products created out of good intentions could be abused. But a person with bad intentions would never create a product which would do good because it would be undoing their own handiwork.<br><br>sorry but i don't agree that religion cause people to segregate from each other<br>religions provides different systems of beliefs for people but PEOPLE erect walls between each other. You have the freedom of choice to leave or not to leave out others who do not believe in your religion. So ultimately it lies within an individual and the system is not to be blamed. How can religions make demands? It's once again PEOPLE within that religion who make those demands of unquestionable faith and do not use logic to argue tis n dat...blah blah blah...<br><br>the only thing i'd agree with u is your last sentence because religion provides a system. If there is a system, then there would be a possibility that it would be used for abuse but ultimately, those who make the abuses are people.<br>don't equate religion with human decisions.<br><br>without religion, would the cold war start?<br>without religion, would the the world wars start?<br>conflicts arise only because of human nature.<br>everything else are just pawns.<br><br>a no. of pigs are taken and if the first pig cannot fly, then the case of this pig cannot fly is true.<br>assuming that pig k cannot fly, i.e. the pig k cannot fly lar<br>considering pig k+1, pig k+1 also cannot fly lar of course<br>pig k cannot fly gives rise to the proof that pig k + 1 cannot fly, and since the first pig cannot fly, therefore by mathematical induction, all pigs cannot fly.<br>haha...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>the realisation of one's imperfection leads to the realisation of the existence of perfection. do u agree? because only when one knows what are one's shortcomings would one realise the existence of perfection. </blockquote>SO ? Tat doesn't mean perfection being or matter will exists ? The earlier arguments u r mentioning about the existence of a perfect being JUSt because we realise men r not perfect. I say the handphone is too heavy, and the perfect weight for handphone is 0 grams. IS there a weightless handphone ? I can say tat the perfect power consumption for a TV is zero. Is there a TV tat do not take in any power ? Perfection is an IDEA. Whether it exists or not is another thing. Defining perfection for certain attributes is easy. But it is unlikely tat it will exists.<br><br><blockquote>u cannot prove the fact that there u are perfect therefore u cannot disprove the above statement</blockquote>U claim tat there is a perfect being, it is your responsibility to show it. Otherwise anybody can claims everything. I can claim tat god is a purple hippo. Why don't u proof it to me tat he is not ? U r not perfect either so how can u prove it to me ?<br><br><blockquote>so let's define it.<br>religion: a system of beliefs and worship<br>under this definition, anything goes as long as it's a SYSTEM.<br>system: a set of connected things that form a whole or work together. </blockquote>Lets define from a dictionary:<br><br>Belief in and reverence for a supernatural power or powers regarded as creator and governor of the universe.<br><br>A personal or institutionalized system grounded in such belief and worship.<br><br>Personally I just want to emphasis on the word supernatural.<br><br><blockquote>so is an individual a system? no. is a group of people a system? not necessarily. is a group of people having the same religion?yes. when u are part of the system there is definitely a certain decorum one has to follow and actions which are expected. politics u may say but these are EXPECTED out of a system, which is definitely what a religion holds.<br>now we'd gotta seperate the state from the religion.<br>politics is the science and art of government. If u take it that it involves the control over ALL aspects of the people of the society, then religion is politics. If u take it as wad we usually take it as in the garmen is responsible for this and that and who cares wad u believe as long as u pay your taxes and stay outta trouble... religion is NOT a political system. Religion would still be a system, keep in mind that though.<br>btw no one knows for sure whether the universe was created or not. </blockquote>So wat r u trying to say here ?!?! Politics hold powers on how a group of people behaves by setting laws. If a religion turns out to be against the policies of the politicians they get to be eradicated and discouraged by the authorities. U can easily see such influences from the latest falungong incidents.<br><br><blockquote>so u went out of point there. Thomas Edison invented the light bulb with good intentions. the light bulb was a product of good intention. Nobel invented trinitrotoluene (TNT) with good intentions too (blast open the mountains to build tunnels) but others took it and use it as a weapon. Products created out of good intentions could be abused. But a person with bad intentions would never create a product which would do good because it would be undoing their own handiwork. </blockquote>Can u say tat everything in the world is invented by people who must have good intentions ? Some of the inventions just meant tat the inventor want to earn a money from it or it is meant to kill people. Is the inventor of machine guns and tanks necessary righteous or evil ? Not necessary, such things is random. There is a possibility tat the inventor of paper is an evil, good or normal person. SO does the creator of the universe. Who says tat he must be a being who must necessary perform good deed and not evil ?<br><br><blockquote>sorry but i don't agree that religion cause people to segregate from each other<br>religions provides different systems of beliefs for people but PEOPLE erect walls between each other. You have the freedom of choice to leave or not to leave out others who do not believe in your religion. So ultimately it lies within an individual and the system is not to be blamed. How can religions make demands? It's once again PEOPLE within that religion who make those demands of unquestionable faith and do not use logic to argue tis n dat...blah blah blah... </blockquote>Com'on, even the christian scripture segregate people into believers and non -believers during judgement day. Christian believes in a god tat destroy many civilisation because they have a different religion too. Muslim also have doctrines tat support muslim to band together and support other muslim brothers if they r prosecuted. Isn't tat a clear sign tat the religion itself supported segregation. These r all mentioned in the scriptures, not people. These r obvious flaws with the system.<br><br>If u say tat religion doesn't segregate people, then u r probably over optimistic. Even in discussion on religion here, there is already a clear sign of some segrergation between the people. The freethinker and the religious. In fact there is a forum meant for christians to discuss in sgforums (eternal hope). Isn't tat another sign of segregation ? Wat is the fact now ? Has it cause segregation ?<br><br>IMO, u should stop telling us how ideal men should perform. We should focus on how normal man react when faced with the system of religion. If everyone r ideal men, they won't need a religion anyway. Normal men abuse the system of religion, and they abuse it more easily and create more harm than the benefits from it.<br><br><blockquote>the only thing i'd agree with u is your last sentence because religion provides a system. If there is a system, then there would be a possibility that it would be used for abuse but ultimately, those who make the abuses are people.<br>don't equate religion with human decisions. </blockquote>Sorry man, the system of religion create a flawed system tat make abuses extremely easy. It is human error tat make such abuses, but the system r so prone to such errors tat it shouldn't it be "revised" ? It is like not giving operator of construction workers any safety devices when they r handling dangerous work. When they r injured, it is all human errors too. Can we really blame them ? Shouldn't the design or system be improved so there r less injuries ?<br><br><blockquote>without religion, would the cold war start?<br>without religion, would the the world wars start?<br>conflicts arise only because of human nature.<br>everything else are just pawns. </blockquote>I never say tat religion is the cause of all conflicts. I am saying tat it is the cause of much conflicts. Will the crusaders start without religion ? Will there be conflicts between isrealis and palestinains if there is no religion ? Will there have 911 attacks if there r no religion ? Throughout history u see many conflicts just because of religion too. U can't discount tat it created more conflicts by making the organisation for conflicts easier.<br><br><blockquote>a no. of pigs are taken and if the first pig cannot fly, then the case of this pig cannot fly is true.<br>assuming that pig k cannot fly, i.e. the pig k cannot fly lar<br>considering pig k+1, pig k+1 also cannot fly lar of course<br>pig k cannot fly gives rise to the proof that pig k + 1 cannot fly, and since the first pig cannot fly, therefore by mathematical induction, all pigs cannot fly. </blockquote>Ahhh... but then doesn't tis apply to god too ? Animal A r not perfect, so does matter B. U can interpolate all the matter in the universe or living creatures and none of them r perfect. So by mathematical inductions, there is no such things as a perfect being thus religon is all bull.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>BTW, wat does your earlier argument state ? U say tat since human realise tat they r imperfect, therefore they know wat is perfection and thus there should be a perfect being. ISn't tat totally wrong ? The analogy on the pig still hold, since knowing wat is perfect doesn't mean a perfect being must exists; Knowing wat is flying like doesn't mean pigs can fly.</div>
