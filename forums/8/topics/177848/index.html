            <div class='col-md body'>GP will fail. where u got ur information from?<br><br><strong>"The Basic living"<br><br>The first generation of flats in sg to arrive in the 60s and 70s Bishan ,Toa Payoh and Tiong bahru.

Many estates were already conceived at this time.<br><br>Kallang Basin was still be reclaimed at this stage. The land of Marine Parade was alreay taking shape, and its first user is Bedok Camp at the end of the plot.<br><br>There is a book on the first 10-years of HDB at National Library, Level 11.<br><br><strong>" Simple elegant living"<br><br>The 2nd generation of estates to appear around 1980 and <span style="font-style: italic;">contuining</span> throughout the 80s.

One interesting fact is that the area used to be a sand quarry area, and hence the name Potong Pasir, which means "cut sand".
