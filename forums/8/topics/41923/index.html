            <div class='col-md body'>It is up to everyone experience and thinking. For those who are mature enough they will respect other's ppl religion. But for those who are narrow minded, they will remember their bad experience for the rest of their lives and it is a very sad thing to see that happening. For me, i used to hate christians and condemn them but i too have been changed. Now i am a christian. Cos when GOD touches your heart, you really will be changed.</div>
