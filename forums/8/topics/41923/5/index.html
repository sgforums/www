            <div class='col-md body'>The Bible indeed was indeed subjected to massive editing through the ages by the Church. Christians should use the intellect given to Man to discriminate between the true teachings of Jesus vs those that were obviously edited to favor the Church. The placement of bishops next to the King and Queen in the English chess setting gives an indication of how much political influence the Church held in the past.<br><br>Many do not know that the early Church supported the concept of Reincarnation. In AD 553, the idea was rejected by the Second Council of Constantinople so as to hasten the pace of salvation. The Church is also guilty of many other alterations of the teachings, making the Bible a book of half-truths. True Christians should read the Bible of the Heart rather than the Holy Bible.<br><br>Truth is no theory; Truth is Truth. Truth that can only stand tall by loping off the heads of others is not Truth. It is not a matter of belief, the Universe will be chaotic if it had to reshape its laws based on the ever-changing beliefs of Man.  Even though seriously edited, the Bible contains certain truth if one interprets it correctly. But it is highly unlikely that one can gain a good understanding from the Bible alone.<br><br>Ideally, one must rise above the idea of having only one way. Like the six blind men describing the elephant, one must awake to the fact that all paths are but directions to the same goal. Christians who are uncomfortable to learn from the teachings of other religions, should at least know of the new developments that are taking place in the world. Edgar Cayce, who in his lifetime got into trouble for his teachings which contradicted the Church, once remarked that the lost teachings of Jesus will one day be released by the Supreme so as to quicken ManÂ’s development.<br><br>Indeed, the lost teachings have been found and are freely available. For those who are determined to advance spiritually(of any religion), the resources provided are a great help. For those who just want to prove that their religion is superior, I will just leave them to their Fate. It is only a matter of time that all will realize Truth, and time is nothing in the eyes of the Infinite.<br><br>Recommended reading:  <a href="http://www.thenazareneway.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenazareneway.com/</a><br>Gospel of the Holy 12<br>Essence Gospels of Peace<br>Gospel of Thomas<br>Christ in Islam<br>Forgeries in Christianity<br>Third Secret of Fatima<br>Inconsistencies of the New Testament<br></div>
