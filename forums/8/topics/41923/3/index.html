I guess like i  said christians are always subjected to ridicule more often than others. I dun mind that actually becos the more they ridicule us, it means that they actually notice us!!! Whether people love or hate us, the same amount of attention is being put on us. And as long it remains at that, i am glad. The opposite of love is not hate, its apathy  and i am worried abt that hehehehe....<br><br>cheers to you.</div></blockquote>No worries, mate.  Well...  I'd rather my religion be noticed for its goodness rather than its bad points.  But such discussion tend to show more bad than good, doesn't it?  I mean...  Making light of the situation, I don't think the big kahuna in the sky would say, 'it's ok that we're being viewed as clowns, it's great we're being viewed already', right?  Ah, religion, can't live with it, can't live without it.<br><br>Well, I decided to play the game by their rules for the Jehovah's Witnesses.  Believe it or not, I tried persuading them to join Buddhism instead.  Chuckle...  All I had to do was relate the similarities of their faith to the philosophies of Buddhism, and then show them the more practical side of it.  I didn't think I was evil.  Just wanted them to know an Asian's perspective better.  Chuckle...  I was close to doing it to one or two fervent Christians here in Singapore but decided to simply praise them for their passion and left it at that.   But if they didn't get their hint, the knuckle dusters came out...  Chuckle...<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>
