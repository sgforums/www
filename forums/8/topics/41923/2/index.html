We leave justifying other people's actions to God.  Whether these people are being taken as representative of the church  is not really what God wants  me to be concerned about but instead that I should concentrate on what is good, pure and holy and to follow Him as a disciple of God. The actions of others, we cant change them, we cant justify them, so why not leave it to God, whom we both believe as Almighty.</div>

Well for me, I have no problems going to temples, going to chinese funerals but I do not partake in the rituals, i see no problem being there.<br><br>But of course what I want to put into perspective is that some christians who ask you to go to church but reject your invitation to go to temples cannot  always be perceived as 'holier than thou' or whatever negative connotations you may have. It is the same as asking  a vegan who offered you veggie because he/she thinks is good but you tell the vegan that you would take the veggie if he/she eats a piece of meat, which she dislikes or rejects.<br><br>What I wanna say above is that, dun perceive that christian to be  bad or pushy or arrogant or belittling just because he refused to go to  a temple with you. His invitation to church is because he thinks is good. If you say No, so be it. And if he says No to your invitation to a temple, so be it. That doesnt say  anything about that person.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the way i read it is. most ppl are quite unhappy on the ferventness of christians sharing to their friends. but i'd like to point out why we do it. its just that we have found something really worthy, something really good, a treasure, and we sincerely wish to share this treasure with you. of course forcing the treasure on you is not our intention. but we only want you to at least listen without any biasness and then decide for yourself with logic whether what we say make sense. then decide again for yourself whether to take it or not.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My take...<br><br>Since there was another thread about religious thumpers along with this thread, I thought I'd put my thoughts in here instead of both.  Note the word religious thumpers, not just to followers of the cross.<br><br>Having experienced a change in life and linking it to religion is fine.  I'm sure some people treat their work almost as passionately some who follow their religion.  But the way they try to persuade you to follow the word is somewhat hard to take.  I'd rather prefer they live their chnaged lives as a beaming example, and let others approch them to ask them about it.  If I was interested in something, I'd ask about it.  Curioisty, manifested on its own, can be so much more powerful when left on its own and not influenced.  Unfortunately, the fervent religious practitioners, in their belief to save lives, attempt to tamper with this curiosity and more often than not turn it into hatred or discontent.  Worse, they use threats of damnation and eternal suffering when the audience doesn't sway to the word.<br><br>Personally, I think Christinaity has received the most flak simply because it's so high profile.  Hmmm... By the way, which religion is the most prominent?  I'm trying to look for figures here.  Is it Islam or Christianity?  With stuff like the war in Iraq, questions have been raised about whether this is a religious war or a 'sound' (for lack of a better word) war.  But let's keep it at home, shall we?  Chrisitianity has the most followers in Singapore, no?  So naturally, like the ol' saying goes, the bigger you are, the harder you (should) fall.  That's why I said what I said in the thread about the pastor being caught for embezzlement.<br><br>Here's one experience I had, a positive one at that.  I was appraoched by one student whilst I was studying who wanted to interest me in Christianity.  I'm a Buddhist.  When I told him I was a buddhist, he asked me which Buddhism I followed.  Nice chap actually but I knew what his intentions were.  I told him and he said he used to be in that religion.  So I asked him why he left it, and he gave me the answer I was hoping for - 'I left it because it didn't give me the spiritual satisfaction that Christianity gives me'.  Perfect, really.  So we talked for a while but I told him that I was happy with my faith and beliefs, and he left me at that.  Two different religions working perfectly here.  That was one good experience out of about 8 or 9.  The rst being not so good unfortunately.  But my point is, it's how you package the thing.  Most fail dismally...<br><br>Actually, i'm not sure if any f youse have had this experience.  ever had Jehovah's Witnesses knock on your door?  I had a few Down Under.  Now that was tough!!

I guess like i  said christians are always subjected to ridicule more often than others. I dun mind that actually becos the more they ridicule us, it means that they actually notice us!!! Whether people love or hate us, the same amount of attention is being put on us. And as long it remains at that, i am glad. The opposite of love is not hate, its apathy  and i am worried abt that hehehehe....<br><br>cheers to you.</div>
