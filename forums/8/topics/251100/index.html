            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The unpredictable weather</strong>, the rising temperature, the depleting oil, minerals, the rising seawater, floods and avalanches, are related to global warming, and depletion in oil and coal for electricity production.<br><br>Take a look at the air now, the clarity cannot be compared to 10 years ago. And you will never see the warm cloudy day again. With the increased in automobiles and IT utilisation, the world will end soon, not in some doomsday-judgement, nor suicidal-cultish way, but due to global warming, floods, diseases, bird flu and civil and foreign wars. And it is happening now.<br><br>Oh and did you do your part? How many of you like bikes and cars, modifying the parts and engines, just for rumbling power and flashiness to show off? Did you spare a thought for the earth in the miles of ground dug and oil being sucked out, just for your desires? So what is the purpose of modifying parts and care about this or that brand of cars having how many litres of horsepower? I don't think there is any purpose in speeding in Singapore except you want to meet the guardians of Hades fast enough, or your insurance to spew some free cash on your disability. People are often jealous of others with 'this or that' cars, I don't know why. Other than transport, flashy cars are practically useless, except for sales,  and do absolutely no good to th earth. Why show off your automobiles when in fact it is created from the materials of earth? It is not owned by your fragile being.<br><br>How many people listen to Ipods nowadays? How many people need an Ipod just to keep in the fashion trend? Think about it what purpose does it serve to follow and show your superiority and comfort just with an Ipod? People are just influenced mindlessly by the general media. I read an article in <span style="font-style: italic;">Straits Times </span>recommending; why not just sing and hum the songs to yourself and improve your singing?<br><br>I can't help but laughed at reading people who have their coms shut down just by playing games, CnC2, DotA and whatever. The computer just cannot withstand the enormous energy consumption rate which is being sucked out of earth just for your silly games to kill your little boredom. What purpose does CnC and DotA serve? Does it cure the earh of its dieases? Why don't you play sports or read books, or waste your mental energy to heal the earth and something beneficial for you and others, rather than  blast the music play the games to 'cure you of your work depression'. Sounds hilarious? It does, people are hilarious anyway. I will say it is great that your com shut down for if not, you won't be able to see your grandsons(next generation). Same for PSP and consoles, adults acting like spoilt brats keep braying parents for those just to 'cure' their stupid boredom. They want it, because it can utilise earths depleting resources not for any beneficial purpose, but to stisfy their selfish boredom.<br><br>And 21 years old are throwing childish temper just because they can't connect to MSN and IRC. Why on the computer for days just to logged onto MSN/IRC and declared "I am away". And in the end your com cannot live long for it over heats. And also people bragging for 4 gig RAM upgrade. This is hilarous! You want to suck coal and oil more just to satisfy yor visual entertainment? What is the point of the many conservative groups trying to prrotect the earth, it will still be destroyed in the hand of the money leeching companies and selfish human.<br><br>And there is this handphone craze, I don't see why everyone is leeching handphones; should have 'this and that functions, the more the better'. what's the purpose you only use handphone to communicate and messaging and infact, researchers have found handphones cause more miscommunications than understanding. And it is one of the top reasons for break ups. And somemore you don't really use the video, photo functions for any beneficial purposes, but just for your mindless, grumbly, silly blogs which attracts no one except your inner garments and flesh.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Straits Times</span> published the majority of tech savy internet surfers are teenagers, followed by young adults then the middle aged. Do you know that as long as your gadgets is in standby mode, when off, it still consume as much as up to 80% of total monthly electricity when it is on? Do you switch off the plugs completely? Do you off the lights and fans? Do you off the radio when not listen? Do you shut down your com when not in use?<br><br>If you see the mentality of people craving materialistic values nowadays, a 25 year old will think like a 12 year old spoilt brat, and there's not much difference, a scientist will certainly agree. Think about how you waste electricity. And you are thinking 'I don't really care about global warming and all that stuffs', well it might be raining heavily now or the weather is making you perspire. Oh is the dust making you cough and sore eyes? For how long have you not experience a 'one fine sunny day' or a 'one cool breezy day'?</div>
