            <div class='col-md body'><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><span class="large"><strong>As the NKF saga continues, people are getting increasingly confused.<br><br>As more people, from the coffee shop gossiper to the elite at the top, share their views and opinions, more doubts emerge and, as they say, Â“the more you stir the cloudier it becomesÂ”. Instead of trying to pacify, those who are of good intention may only serve to pollute the issue.<br><br>We are talking about the means and the ends. There is no doubt and no question at all Â– from the highest office in this land to the guy in the one room HDB flat Â– that NKF is necessary. It is a respectable establishment and it has saved many lives throughout the years. Nobody in his right mind should pick a quarrel on this. NKF mission will be here to stay and supported by everybody who has a heart. So let us all agree that we believe in and support the ends and will not use them as a tool to justify the means.<br><br>By linking the ex NKF CEO with NKF so intimately, we are accusing people of attacking NKF when they attack the man. The average man in the street now finds that he is talking about the "devil" and the angel at the same time and people are telling him they are the same. He is very confused. He does not know whether to part with his hard earned money in the name of charity.<br><br>The majority of Singaporeans did not know this man TT Durai until a week ago. They only know about him through newspaper reports on the court proceeding. And the reports have been bitter, shameful and shocking. Unless they are told not to believe what is mentioned in court, can we blame them for drawing ugly conclusions about this man, and those he once reported to?<br><br>On the other hand there are people who know Durai very well. They must have seen him put in great efforts to build NKF and they certainly admire him for what he has had done for the needy patients. Without him, many patients would have died and there wouldnÂ’t be so much reserve in the NKF coffer so, explicitly or otherwise, they support the perks and remunerations rendered to the man.<br><br>Herein lies the problem - platform and perception. I donÂ’t know which is more difficult Â– putting the first group of people on the shoes of the second to look at this man or vice versa. In any case we can argue until the cow comes home and there is no conclusion because each is standing on a different platform trying to justify the means to a very noble end.<br><br>Talking is easy. However much of the talks will be interpreted differently. If we really want to move on and let the new team continue the good work of NKF, albeit by different means, then all of us should be wise enough to shut up. Nobody shall attempt to impose his or her views on others because like I said, we are on different platforms. Only the relevant authorities should do their official investigations and duly report to all concerned.<br><br>Perhaps we can be more comfortable if we can find an honest answer to this question Â– the means and the ends Â– which is more important?</strong></span><br><br></div>
