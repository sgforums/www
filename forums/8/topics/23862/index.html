            <div class='col-md body'><strong>ANALYSE THIS :</strong> noticed&gt; there's no point trying to reason with the unreasonable. many people have tried before. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">he's proven to be unstable, bordering on the psychopathic and i doubt very much if anyone on ir feels sorry for this guy from the pathetic way he's behaving.</span><br><br><strong>SUSANS_LOVERBOY : </strong> To noticed, Susan was an abused wife ! In her affidavit, she mentioned that her son is very protective of her till today as he had witnessed the pain and suffering his mother suffered while being physically and verbally abused by that no good wife abuser Ex-husband of hers ! Her son is not only scared of his father for beating up his mother, but he knows that a broken family is better than the constant beatings and quarrels that he witness every now and then ! Her son knew of my existence, and was very close and attached to me.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">He knows that I was someone very close to his mother, but never abuse his mother like his daddy did inthe past ! So, how can he be suffering ? He knew that there was love between us even at a young age, but without the violence which he so fears when his dad was in a violent mood swing ! In fact, with the ex-husband of hers gone, she should feel liberated from further sufferings from him !</span>  I do not give a hoot to fellow IR who flames for nothing as they do not have a life ! If they are not happy with the thread, just move on and go elsewhere ! However, I do appreciate kind readers who give sensible advice all this while. The point is there are no flaws in my arguments here and elsewhere. Just frank facts which I've mentioned time and again. I've never hidden any issues related to this topic, and have been very forward with answers to questions from frank readers. However, I do not tolerate flammers, as you have seen how I take care of this bunch of idiots everytime without fail ! <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Don't believe me, try and flame further, and you have seen how I rebutt them in my stride !</span> In fact, I enjoy this sessions with these fake flammers !<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">And remember, I gave her 7 years to come clean with me and give me a face to face apology so that we can forget about this issue [u]and move on with our separate lives ! She'd done wrong, I gave her the chance, [u]but she blew it even though a 7 years grace was offered to her ! Remember, I am a very reasonable person, giving Susan Chua, who had done me wrong a chance to avoid an ugly revelation like this to the public ! She should have taken the route I've given her to avoid tarnishing her reputation and making this public ! So, I have no choice but to share this story with the public to tell the world what she had done is wrong</span> and she needs to know this.<br><br><strong>DISAGREE : </strong>u? reasonable? hahahahaaaaaaa<br><br><strong>LAM_PAR : </strong>he has <span style="text-decoration: underline;">also posted on www.remakingsingapore.gov.sg om the education forum. but his post was promptly removed by admin</span>. persistance or stubborness? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">many initial sympathizers who took his grief with Buddha's compassion must have transformed into fire-breathing Raksas with his upteemth postings in his myriad of reincarnated handles</span>. and has not this forum been filled by the spat between quixotic Moonbabe and Susah_loverboy/d_l_s/f1anakin adnauseum? to me, it feels like the perennial duel between a Godzilla and Ghidora. The rest of Tokyo suufers.<br><br><strong>CDC :</strong> *Aw,I want nothing from her,just for her to acknowledge the fact that she did wrong and i am ready to forgive.*<br><br>Haha,<span style="text-decoration: underline;">what you really want to hear is this,that she really did it because she love you and not used you*ain't it just too bad ,get over it you've been used and dumped* You are just trying to vindicate yourself,you feel abused. So sad.*still thinking it was all about love and how naive you were</span><br><br><strong>SUSANS_LOVERBOY : </strong>CDC, no need 3 para, but simple answer being, you are such an ass posting with so many fake black handle that pisses not me, but others off on IR !!! That's a stupid move and please grow up ! Or are u so full pus on your pathetic bosy that you are now permanently at the Communicable Disease Centre for your treatment, and that's how you end of with the handle CDC now ? Come on tell usw the truth pus head ?<br><br><strong>SUSANS_LOVERBOY :</strong> CDC , <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the nation can smell of your pus fron any direction ! Is that from your ass or mouth ? Or each time you type your replies, your pus starts flowing ? </span>Come on don't spoil the keyboard and ask your doctor to start stop the pus flow further otherwise you'll spread your disease ! Hee hee hee CDC is flowing pus again ! <span style="text-decoration: underline;">How to bother me when you are dripping pus from all your "lobangs" ???</span><br><br><strong>SUSANS_LOVERBOY :</strong> Hey CDC, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">make sure your family members don't get into contact with your pus or else...........<br>They'll end up at the CDC like you ! </span>Hee hee hee<br><br><strong>SUSANS_LOVERBOY :</strong> Hey pus head, why so quiet, you got so excited with the World Cup finals that your pus is flowing non stop each time Ronaldo scored a goal ??? Relax CDC, take your medicine and your pus will stop flowing for the time being, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">otherwise you cannot "chio" me here and that will be a shame</span><strong><br><br>[b]SUSANS_LOVERBOY :</strong> Hey moonbabe, it does not matter whether you fake flammers whether you believe in the SC story anymore, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">as I am taking part in your flamming sessions </span>!<br>Enjoy the flamming fun I have in store for you lame morons and fake personalities ! <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I am just enjoying this every minute of the day </span>!<br><br><strong>SUSANS_LOVERBOY :</strong> Moonbabe stop using another fake black handle and please post with your red moonbabe handle !<br>The answer has been posted before and you are not paying attention to my answers, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">but attempting time and again to repeat the same question, and deviating from the main topic "NYP SEX SCANDAL SUSAN CHUA SBM" !</span><br><br><strong>LAM_PAR :</strong> I have half a mind of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">getting admin to ban this guy</span>. not sure if admin will respond to such undemocratic requests, but i feel that the ruckus raised by all the ''susan chua'' posts is a tad tiring and irritating. besides, i am not sure if this fella is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a significant contributor to all the other inane flamings on the net he may come up again as some other handle</span>, but a ''neighbourhood watch'' to alert admin to such postings will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ensure that the guy remain dead</span>. i suggest sending email to petition for his removal. what do you people think?<br><br><strong>SUSANS_LOVERBOY :</strong> Really moonbabe, I want this case to go to court ,so that I can show you and others what I have on hand, to prove my case, and also, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to the relevant authorities to change the criminal code so that it only protects innocent women of their modesty like the way you've always pointed out</span>, but stop those guilty of wrondoings, shielding behind the law introduced, to protect the true innocent party ! But to be frank with you, I have zero respect for you as you are a big hypocrite and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">arrogant prick that talks like a big fcuk, </span>and hiding and posting with fake black handles to deviate from the true facts mentioned by me ! You have time and again tried to shield Susan Chua and say that I am always in the wrong, but she's in the right ! May I ask do u have a great liking for her ? Or are u intimately related to her now, and that's the reason you are always out to help her and "fighting" me on this forum ? And stop denying that you are not siding her and even "mocking" her in your own" time frame", as you've been supporting her all these while, and "attacking" me with your fake postings under fake black handles to disguise your true intentions ! <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I have ways to track you and put you on monitoring mode without your knowledge.</span> You can always take me as a joke, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">but when I'm out to get trouble makers like you, I will use all resources to put you away permanently ! </span></strong>Don't assume that you know me that well, as you've claimed here. Remember "assumption is the mother of all fcuk up" ? And remember, I do not boast of my capability, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">but prove it to you in action</span></strong>. I'll advise you from stepping onto shit and minding your own business for your own good sake ! That is a good advice from a fellow IR user<br><br><strong>CAVE_LAD :</strong> SL/d_l_s/mf/f1anakin&gt;<br><br>Whate your grudge with SC, when you use lines like this:<br><br>"<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">You can always take me as a joke, but when I'm out to get trouble makers like you, I will use all resources to put you away permanently !"</span></strong><br><br>that can be taken as a threat (particualrly when it is directed at an identifiable individial). Either<br><br>a) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you are incapable of physically delivering on the threat, in which case you are simply making verbal threats to puff yourself up and play to your own behavioural issues; or</span><br><br>b) you have the capability + stated intent = criminal intent.<br><br>Anyway you look at it SL/d_l_s/mf/f1anakin, making threats against others is not a good way to proceed. Remember, IR may also keep records of deleted threads so do not ssume that because you cannot see it, it cannot be used in a court of law against you.<br><br>Another piece of advice:<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Like most redders, we really don't care one way or the other about you or SC. If the earth swallowed both of you up today, I doubt any of us would feel anything. You have made your point but if you continue to labour it, you will lose what little sympathy you have in the IR community. However, if your intention is to simplay attract attention to yourself and get some kind of kick out of being continuously flamed, then keep doing whatever it is you are doing</span>.<br><br><strong>ASTUTE :</strong> susans_loverboy : <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you have no friends</span>, at least not here and you probably have no friends outside IR either, cos if u did, why wld u bother posting here when u could talk to the people who care about you?<br><br><strong>SUSANS_LOVERBOY :</strong> Hee hee hoo hoo ha ha ha ha ha ha damn funny man ! Cannot stop rolling too ! But I can only agree to one point that comes close and that is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">have to pay small damages to the cuckolded ex-husband of Susan Chua's for trespassing his "property" and that is her p-u-s-s-y ! Ok lah, small change to pay for using that "facility" for a year ! Cheaper than Geyland anytime ! </span>Anyway that was the only court cost the ex- abusive husband of hers ever got from me !<br><br><strong>JUSTICE_BAO :</strong> Yes agree partly with Truth, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">silence is not just a sign of courage but a wise legal decision as well. Because his action/decision's not act through his conscience, not rather by some legal constrain</span><br><br><strong>JUSTICE_BAO :</strong> pocketpig3&gt; Are you new in IR? I guess you should be also the same person posting @4 July 2002 - 2:40 am. who's creating trouble over here? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Do you know how many times that fellow had posted somebody's personal particulars without his/her consent in a public internet site</span>? We have every reasons to believe that there has been a police order filed against him for harassment years ago. I would like to state here is that sometimes <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a person lying low's not bcos of one's conscience but rather it's bcos of legal constraints..</span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">We need the peace as well. But if somebody disagrees with another person's opinion/view in a forum. Then i guess it should be fine to air it out. If you have all have eyes to see who is right and wrong, then it's your own personal view/opinion</span>.<br><br><strong>TST :</strong> Hey hey pocketpig3 you claims to be a man of words huh? But i have seen you posting those threats for all these afternoon saying you gotta speak to that TIM &amp; have been using the TIM's "weight" to threaten moonbabe, Justice Bao and et al.<br><br>I guess you have been treating many people as a 3-year-old kids.. btw <span style="text-decoration: underline;">i m also hailed from sg leh hmmm i also know of this tactic of using Complaints to threaten pple lor. But i also know a bit of law lah.. I m a bit kia si lah so I know leh it's better not to invade on one's privacy by viewing his/her personal particulars with his/her consent.</span> I thought you mentioned somethings like you had seen the "evidence" lor?Is that true huh? Very juicy right?<br><br><strong>TST :</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dun play play with provoking or flaming ppl with vulgarities. Other forums (eg. http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=23237) are taking similar actions against that fellow.</span><br></div>
