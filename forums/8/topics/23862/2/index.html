            <div class='col-md body'><strong>FI_ANAKIN : </strong>This is a true story amd time and again, the authorities are trying to cover up this issue and having the threads removed. However, this will persist indefinitely until action has been taken against Susan Chua of NYP. The above lecturer abuused her school authorit by having sex wit her lover at the former NYP TIong Bahru campus. They did it at the her office, storeroom, and lecture theatre in 1994 and 1995. Later, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">she dumped her lover without a word</span>, and filed a false police report of harassment to get rid of him. Do u think it is ethical of her to do such things ? And should the authorities take action against her<br><br><strong>F1_ANAKIN : </strong>Dear moderators of Icered, the above incident is true, and if the above individual known as Susan Chua from NYP challange you with a legal lawsuit, accept it, as these are facts and not someting put up to defame her. Remember, in a court of law, facts are facts, and if you have got your facts right, you don't have to worry. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">If needed, just email me and I'll send you hard copies for you to rebut their future removal request. </span>Look, there were over 2000 views on the last thread, and it shows, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">readers are keen to know more of this scandal and wrong doing</span>. Then alll like minded lecturers/teachers will not abuse the system by abusing school authority and using "underhand tactics" by filing false police report to "fix" others ! <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Please have some pride and don't bow down to pressure especially unresonable ones !</span><br><br><strong>F1_ANAKIN : </strong>Come to think of it, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I know why the thread was removed</span>, as I have revealed too much, and some guilty parties are damn embarassed !!! Ha ha ha, now the world know so much about our kind hearted and nice lecturer ! Surprised right with so much new revelation about her ?<br><br><strong>F1_ANAKIN : </strong>Hey interested readers, please email me at : s1606310z@hotmail.com I'll send you reprinted court documents and pictures of Susan Chua and lover ! Then, you can see and read for yourself the full insight story of this affair and scandal ! Remember the old chinese saying, "Paper cannot cover fire", well this is what I mean, even if the threads are removed, it's just temporary and will be back !!! "LASTETS HOT NEWS ON SUSAN CHUA SEX SCANDAL, READ ALL ABOUT IT" !!!<br><br><strong>F1_ANAKIN : </strong>Readers please take note that had Susan Chua not "fixed" me with a false police report, I would not have wanted to wash dirty linens in public. The fact is she wanted to use <span style="text-decoration: underline;">'underhand tactics' </span>to get rid of me, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">hence I am just returning her in kind.</span> Wanted me out of her life, just say so, and we could have had an amicable split . No need to resort to making false police report ! Hope she now knows how I felt when she attempted to get me into trouble with the law for her selfish reasons ! <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I gave her 7 years to come clean with me </span>and apologise for her mistake made by her back then. She gave up that option, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">so don't blame me </span>for sharing this story with the general public.<br><br><strong>F1_ANAKIN : </strong>We also had sex at the former NYP Tiong Bahru campus till around May 1995.<br>On one occasion, we also did it on a Sunday when Susan Chua went back to her office to do some work. She called me and I went over and we adjourned to a lecture theatre where we made passionate love with the aircon at full blast ! The next day, she told me she could not concentrate teaching as she was distracted by the thought of us having sex there the day before. She said she was focusing on that same spot where we made love, and she was not in the right frame of mind to teach !<br><br><strong>F1_ANAKIN : </strong>To observer, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I have tried calling her , but she slammed down the phone at me without even giving me a chance to speak .</span> I was even given a chance to defend myself if she had been not happy with me at that point of time<span style="text-decoration: underline;">. No reasons given, and after my call and visit to her office and home, for which she ignored me, I was sumoned to the police station where I was told she had filed a police report against me for harassing her ! </span>That was a blatant lie or an excuse to get rid of me for her own selfish reasons. In anycase, she did not need to resort to this kind of behaviour of leaving someone. Just speak her mind, and I'll accept reality and leave. Not only is she putting me in a difficult position and inconvenience, but also herself at risk for committing a crime by her false police report which the Singapore police will not take lightly ! If I had approached her again, she will filed another police report like the way she did and that is what I want to avoid. Like some others said, that the police always take the lady's side when it comes to this kind of situation, and with her "highly respectable job", the cops will think I am in the wrong and she is in the right ! Yes, they will initially believe 80 % to 90 % of her story, and 10 % to 20 % of mine ! But the bottom line is I do not want to be inconvenienced by her "modus operandi" again ! Why, because she is a woman, and a lecturer ! So, am I a fool to fall into her "bait" again ?<br><br>F1_ANAKIN : To observer, The pic you mentioned is to prove to those who doubted that Susan Chua and I had a relationship. There were some who thought I made a pass at her when I was a student and got rejected, that's why I'm attacking her in forum. But these people never remember that if it's just a rejection of hers due to a pass, would I be bothered to go through such length to emphasize on this issue ? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The fact is I was a victim, am a victim, and still a victim, </span>until justice has been done for the false police report filed by her to get rid of me due to her selfish reasons ! <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The other accusation of mine that she abused her authority by having sex with me at different locations at the former NYP Tiong Bahru campus is up to the authorities to pursue.</span> If they want to turn a blind eye, so be it, but make sure all future abuses are tolerated equally, and not on a case by case basis of who can go away scott free or who will be punished, as this will lead to others not respecting the authorities in their future judgements !<br><br>VIEWER : you sad freakin dick head. of all the mails here almost 90 % are from you. Apparently no one agrees that you are the victim, rather, you are the evil bastard that offered your ugly dick to seduce this woman, then break up her family. remember you dork, men can't be rape. you already know that she is married, that makes you the scum that has committed adultery, not her. you got no shame and now you wanna destroy her with your publicity. but it seems that most people are in favor of good than evil, which is why no one seems to stand by your side. jump off the cliff or set yourself on fire, the world will rejoice on that<br><br>F1_ANAKIN : Oh, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you are now saying that Susan Chua is so loose that she will be willing to sprerad her legs wide for any dickhead that offers his dick to her !!! [u]How to break up her family if she had not been lusty enough to spread her legs and want to have entry like a dog ?</span>She <span style="text-decoration: underline;">enjoyed those fcuking sessions</span>, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">that makes her guiltier than me</span>, as she made a cuckold out of that loser husband ! But then again, that loser husband physically abused her, so, he is to blame for his wife cuckolding him with someone else !!! You have just scored your own goal loser ! <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I don't wanna destroy her with my publicity</span>, but she made a false police report against me, than want to destroy me with that method, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">so I have to reveal this evil deed before others like myself fall into her evil modus operandi in future !!!</span><br><br>F1_ANAKIN : To observer, I totally agree with what you've said, and I was prepared to forgive and forget, but what pissed me off, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is due to the fact that when the last time I called her some years back, she actually called me a bastard for no reason and slammed down the phone !</span>Talking about me giving her the chance to explain, if not apologise for what she had done !<br>That was the last straw, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I told myself she will pay dearly for what she had done to me one day ! In any case, I'm sure she regretted for playing with fire as she should've antipated that there is what we call "pay back time" some day</span>, and she could have just said sorry, and all shall be forgiven and forgotten. But not in her case, she insisted she was right in the wrong she had done, and even had the guts to call me names as though I am the one who'd wronged her in the first place ! Come on, right from the beginning, if she thinks I'd done her wrong, she should have sat down and talk or discuss the issue with me, and not just cooped that up in her and wrongfully said I am wrong this way ! I was never given a chance to defend myself, and I believe it must be her no good " double headed snake", abusive husband cooking up some story that made me looked bad and she fell for the bait ! Talking about her faith in me, whereby I was there for her in her lean moments and she actually rather believed her abusive husband ! In anycase, now the world knows what sort of person she really is, and that is good to look at, with a decent and respectable job, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">an evil bitch on the inside </span>! Well, even the local cops are found guilty of wrondoings from time to time as mentioned on the news, and I am not surprised as we are all human after all ! Share with you alittle information indirectly connected to this issue. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A former police officer by the name of Dominic, formerly from Tanglin police station was in charge of Susan Chua, myself and her ex-husband's case. He was so sympathetic towards her and tried to spike me in front of her by talking back of my character, and made me looked like the bad guy ! I think he took a liking in her at that time, and tried to potray himself as a caring and understanding person. Guess what, he ended up in jail for abusing his authority by keeping something not his, that he had taken while he was an investigating officer of a case involving a female victim, and he was charged in court and jailed for a couple of months ! </span>That appeared in the newspaper afew years back ! Talking of "pot calling the kettle black" !!! Anyway observer, I hope you have gotten through that difficult period of your horrible experience, and I wish you well in your future relationship. I will try and forget this unfortunate episode just like yourself, and move on like you've suggested.<br>Thanks again for the kind words and advice.<br><br>F1_ANAKIN : <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A point that was removed from the earlier thread is that there was a guy whom Susan Chua told me was interested in her. He was a working for a publishing co. that supply books to NYP back then, and she gave his name as Chua Keen Teck</span>. It could have been a fictictious name, but definitely another Mr Chua. Susan actually told him of my existence, and of her abusive husband, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I wounder whether I got dumped for no reason because of him !</span>Susan also told me that her office colleagues also noticed that this guy showed interest in her, and always turning up at NYP Tiong Bahru campus not always on official business ! <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Well, my hunch said one of the reason why I was dumped as I am not a Chua, and he is slightly older than me, hence more suitable to her.</span> But I think if she had divorced her husband, this new Chua could just slipped in just fine without her changing to another surname if she choose to marry him later, and nobody would notice the difference in surname !<br><br>F1_ANAKIN : Hi observer, u are right, I do not give a damn of what,why or whatever is related to Susan Chua. Why ? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coz she's not worth the effort to even give a damn</span> ! In anycase, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the cards are falling on her right now, as this scandal is definitely getting the right attention of those VIP and action should be taken against her for her wrong doings.</span> I sure hope the Singapire autorities do take some action against her, and not sweep this issue under the carpet just because it will tarnish the educational system ! If they 'cover up' the scandal, then I think they will really do more harm than good to the educational system, and also <span style="text-decoration: underline;">my faith in the way the system work </span>. One of the reason I'm so mad with her was due to the fact that she sometimes said some male students from the former NYP Tiong Bahru campus would profess their feelings for her, and that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">made me felt jealous </span>at that point of time and moment ! And now, come to think of it, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">am I the "older model" being dumped for a "newer model" ?</span><br>I like that story that you've used as an example, and I find it very amusing and factual too !<br>Given the same situation now as Susan Chua, I'm sure she is now trying her best to cover up this scandal of hers by telling god father stories, like the way she'd done to me, and some ignorent friends and colleagues of hers will gve her their support ! I am moving in the right direction in life, and all I wanted to do, is to make good the wrong others had done to me, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">hence,the drastic action I'm taking by exposing this scam of hers</span> ! Boy, this is life, and we just have to move on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">despite meeting scumbags out there day in and day out ! </span>Anyway observer, please feel free to contact me by email at s1606310z@hotmail.com I would like to discuss with you some issues, and I'm sure you'll be able to give me some fruitful advice. Thanks again for your time and support on this matter. Cheers !<br><br>F1_ANAKIN : To observer, I totally agree with you, and I'm already doing what you've mentioned sometime back. But somehow, this issue still prick me from time to time over the years, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I told myself I have to expose this scam/injustice that she'd done to me to get the load off my head ! And yes, I feel alot lighter and better after doing so !</span> In anycase, I totally agree with you with your breakdown of reasonings, and I have to say you are very good at it.<br>From time to time, I've done some reflection, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I must say I am also partly to be blamed, as I should have waited for her divorce to be completed before having a relationship with her.</span><br>Guess that is life, we humans are not perfect, and we just have to learn from out mistakes in life ! Thanks again for those kind words of wisdom, and advice.<br><br>F1_ANAKIN : Aiyah, observer is right, I will wash my hands of Susan Chua and enjoy life to the fullest ! I am just treating this episode with her as a lesson learnr, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">most importantly, like a sex guide, as I've experimented with her many ways of sex act and the way she allowed me to use her body is already enough for that matter ! </span>I mean. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fcuking her hundreds of times and allowing me to spill the seeds of love in her without the use of a condom is priviledge enough, so I am not complaining further ! </span>So, Susan, thanks for the year long <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"In Out Wham Bam Boom Done" </span>daily ritual ! I really enjoyed the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">doggy and sideway style with you </span>! And last but not least, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">happy fcuking future to you </span>!!!<br><br>F1_ANAKIN : Hi Observer, Thanks for posting kind words of wisdom again ! You know what, your earlier chinese proverb of hao ma bu chi hui tou chao, was once mentioned by Susan Chua to me that she will never return to a former school she once taught as the principal of that school back then showed interest in her and tried to' hum sup' her at his office ! She claimed to have ignored his advances, and push his hands away from her lap, and later resigned from that job, as she did not want further confrontations of this sort with him !<br>She told me he even offered her shares at the school plus hefty pay rise if she becomes his mistress ! I thought, boy, this is one rare woman, who believes in her chastity and principles !<br>Boy, was I wrong, and I have to say I must have "bat chiu tat stamp" at that time ! Anyway, she ain't worth my effort, and I'm having the time of my life, just like yourself putting the sad episode behind. So observer, how long it took u to forget that sad episode of yours ? Any flashback memories like the way I've enclountered ? In anycase, I appreciate your time and words of wisdom here again, and hope you get on well in life like myself ! CIAO<br><br>F1_ANAKIN : <span style="text-decoration: underline;">She's 38 now, and yes she is still working in NYP at the same SBM department at the AMK campus</span><br><br>F1_ANAKIN : Wow good for you boy ! <span style="text-decoration: underline;">But I get to see what's beneath all those undies in the past</span><br><br>F1_ANAKIN : Blackballoon, I never deny the fact that she is a helpful and friendly lecturer.<br>I was once her student , and agree with your friend. That's on the educational front, but what happens in bed and elsewhere is another story ! Remember you can't judge a book by it's cover ! Why don't you ask your friend to ask Susan why did her husband divorced her ?<br>Or shall I send your friend in NYP a set of her divorce documents so that he/she can challenge Susan Chua over the contents ? Your choice .<br><br>F1_ANAKIN : If one of the parties namely the Respondent or Co-Respondent wants to share the contents, it's fine. In this case, I was the Co-Respondent as I was caught screwing Susan Chua by her ex-husband several times and recorded by his private investigators with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">dates and time of grand events in bed and elsewhere</span><br><br>D_I_S ( Changed from F1_ANAKIN ) : Lamebabe, save your law crap and tell that to Susan and read out to her what's the penalty for filing a false police report !<br><br>SUSANS_LOVERBOY ( Changed from D_I_S ) : <span style="text-decoration: underline;">End of the day Susan will have to pay the big penalty !</span><br><br>SUSANS_LOVERBOY  : My friend, I was using a Motorola 7200 and Ericsson Gh337 in 1994 and 1995 ! And stop using the handphone excuse to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">divert the attention of the main issue that's the NYP Susan Chua Sex Scandal !!!</span>[/b]</div>
