            <div class='col-md body'>the subject is plain and simple, laws that are either hardly justifiable, or sometimes downright unfair.<br>in the Northern Territory, Australia, there is a law dubbed "mandatory sentencing", a bill specifically designed for criminals of Aboriginal descent.  what this basically means is that any Aboriginal who commits an offence, no matter how small or how petty it might be, MUST serve a jail term.  last month, an Aboriginal man was sentenced to 4 years prison after convicted of stealing a packet of biscuits.  the police said the man had a previous record of misdemeanor.  it is a known fact that "black" deaths in custody is very high in Australia, and the man has no hope of bail or parole.  the UN has condemned the so-called bill and secretary general Kofi Annan expressed the UN's concern over the legality of the concept.<br>but at the other end of the stick, in New South Wales, a man who commits first degree murder can appeal his sentence, and even have his conviction downgraded to manslaughter and he can expect a good behavior bond parole within 2 years.<br>justice IS well and truly blind.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Huh??Are u sure that is happening in Oz? Are there still law??Where those judical systems get their certificates??A scam or what?Wait the law is applied by the legislation which includes the government as well, isn't it?What is the Australian government doing?<br><br>Racism?But those aboroginals are considered Australians too....and there are so called their "forefathers"... and do they live on reservations or ...? In North America, lands are allocated to each respective Native American tribe...and there are councils to take care of their lives in all aspects. I do heard that the aboroginals in Oz did a couple of crimes...but the moral is why the discrimination of laws in these individuals?<br><br>Give them a knife and slash both an aboroginal and white Aussie's arm...aren't there still warm red blood??Absurd!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>------------------<br>Writing is a weapon that is more powerful than a man's fist.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the objective of mandatory sentencing is to prevent aboriginals from becoming criminals by detering the would-be criminals.  but i don't see the point of throwing them all into prison.  i must admit their track record for crime isn't very commendable, but what else can you turn to when you live like a 2nd class citizen and live in 3rd world conditions, and when the employment opportunities are next to nothing?  for most aboriginals, life is just a continuous cycle of welfare, a cycle which they can't get out of.<br><br>------------------<br>the statement below is true<br>the statement above is false<br><br>[This message has been edited by pluckaduck (edited 15 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To pluckaduck,<br><br>U sure there are such so called "mandatory sentencing" which discriminates the aboriginals?? I really don't think so.The attitude the Australian governement have towards the aboriginals are changing in the last decade or so. They have started to recognise more of the rights of the natives.<br><br>But even if there are really such legislation (which i seriously doubt), u can't really blame the government. Anybody who is from Australia can tell u that the aboriginals aren't exactly very exemplary citizens. Most are on welfare and fighting the bottle is a everyday battle many face. Crimes commited by them are on comparison higher than the whites. They do create quite a problem in society on a whole. But if u look at it in another way, the whites settlers should be blamed in the very beginning. They were the ones who introduced alcohol. They brought with them the evils of a modern world into a community which is basically very simple. I guess there are 2 sides of the picture. But frankly speaking, i really don't think there such wayward legislations in the statutes. This is an abuse of human rights!<br><br>To Rinoa<br><br>I just can't help but correct that it is the legislative body that approves the law and all. And is the executive body that applies the law.</div>
