You may visit the store ONLY ONCE !<br><br>There are six floors and the attributes of the men increase as the<br>shopper ascends the flights. There is, however, a catch . . .. you may<br>choose any man from a particular floor, or you may choose to go up a<br>floor, but you cannot go back down except to exit the building! So, a<br>woman goes to the Husband Store to find a husband . .<br><br>On the first floor the sign on the door reads:<br>Floor 1 - These men have jobs and love the Lord.<br><br>The second floor sign reads:<br>Floor 2 - These men have jobs, love the Lord, and love kids.<br><br>The third floor sign reads:<br>Floor 3 - These men have jobs, love the Lord, love kids, and are<br>extremely good looking.<br>"Wow," she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going.<br>She goes to the fourth floor and sign reads:<br><br>Floor 4 - These men have jobs, love the Lord, love kids, are drop- dead<br>good looking and help with the housework.<br>"Oh, mercy me!"she exclaims, "I can hardly stand it!"<br>Still, she goes to the fifth floor and sign reads:<br><br>Floor 5 - These men have jobs, love the Lord, love kids, are drop- dead<br>gorgeous, help with the housework, and have a strong romantic streak.<br>She is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the sixth floor and the sign<br>reads:<br><br>Floor 6 - You are visitor 4,363,012 to this floor.<br>There are no men on this floor. This floor exists solely as proof that<br>women are impossible to please.<br><br>Thank you for shopping at the Husband Store. Watch your step as you exit<br>the building, and have a nice day!</div>

It just depends on whether both, man and woman, are willing to place efforts to solve problems together...<br><br></div></blockquote>but still... the question is ---&gt; In the relationship, is the effort comes from one sided only???  In these TS's case, the lady in the story is only waiting for a one sided relationship...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Most sg ladies want guys to be successful and wealthy. They also want them to be humourous and sensitive to their needs. For sg men, they want their ladies to be highly educated (common requirement for both genders), gentle, and understanding. The list of expectations can go on forever, but yet some unlikely couples with such expectations still get together, and some will end up in divorce one, two years later or maybe a few decades down the road.<br><br>Successful career woman will hardly want to budge in their expectations which they consider to be right and very basic requirements. The same goes for successful career men too.<br><br>So what's the point?<br><br>Dating, marriage, are not the only things in life that we should seek nor depend too much on for what we think is part of human happiness.<br><br>Human feelings, values change too often, sometimes unexpectedly, along the way at each stage of any relationship and only those who make concerted efforts to keep a relationship or marriage going will lead satisfying and meaningful lives together.<br><br>By all means, continue to improve on the good aspects of our personality and character and try to correct those not so good ones. But remember also to love ourselves as we are.<br><br>If sg women find foreigners to be better than sg men, well, the choice is theirs. What's there to find fault with or scrutinise too deeply into? We can't stop them, just as nobody tries to stop sg men from marrying overseas brides.<br><br>In fact, a portion of sg women may have such bad impression of sg men who they have met along the way, that they are actually quite comfortable with sg men looking for lifelong companionship with overseas women. Likewise, the same for sg men.<br><br>Personally, I don't think I can ever find a sg girl that's humble as suggested by TS's topic. This is from personal experiences and observations made from the real-life stories of my social circle.<br><br>I tell myself not to dream any more and to wake up from it. Dreams for romance, marriage, are best left as dreams. There are more meaningful dreams to have and to realise in real life than most of us would like to think.<br></div>
