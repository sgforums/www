            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, I'm a 27-year-old housewife who has been travelling with my husband around Asia for the past year. We usually stay in a city for 2-4 months then move on to another, due to the nature of his work.<br><br>As such, I've been unable to find a job after resigning from my job in Singapore. Call it the Singaporean Curse, but I am someone who enjoys working very much. I've tried to keep myself occupied by learning a fourth language and attending classes on yoga, knitting, flower arrangement etc. but these are more like time-fillers than activities that give deep fulfillment.<br>There is still a void in my heart that I cannot seem to fill.<br><br>While I do enjoy being a housewife and caring for my husband, I resent waking up everyday and not having goals. I've considered free-lance writing, and community work...but these have not come to fruition due to the short period of stay in each city. I've only managed to do some free-lance translation work, but that is not frequent enough to keep me occupied. Worse, moving from city to city means that I've not been able to build up an immediate circle of friends. My husband travels very frequently (average 2 times a week) which leaves me very lonely.<br><br>We don't plan to have kids for another 1-2 years, so I'm likely to have plenty of time on my hands till then.<br><br>What do you girls do to fill up your time? HELP!!<span style="color: violet;"></span></div>

I tell you....I'm a bum lah.<br><br>I've visited art galleries, musuems etc. but that only takes up a bit of time. I read books by the cartons (no kidding), which I regularly ship back to Singapore, to take weight off my luggage. I've watched/re-watched, all existing seasons of West Wing, Sex &amp; the City, Lost, The Triangle, Deadwood, Desperate Housewives, House etc Not to mention a few hundred other movie titles.<br><br>There are perks to being a travelling 'tai-tai'.....but there's also an emptiness (due to lack of goals) and strange loneliness that few people can understand.<br><br>All too often, when I start to rant, my friends just retort "eh, you're a tai-tai leh, what's there to complain about?" then roll their eyes...<br><br>Sigh... I just want to be more useful to society... and derive some kind of self-fulfillment...</div>

And I already speak four languages...so no more language classes too.<br>As for painting/art etc. Art genes went to younger sister. She has an Art degree from London and works in a museum. Dad used to win national art competitions when he was younger. So trust me, there is no way I can take art classes and not feel lousy at it.<br>As for knitting...I already knit and crochet and have made something for every single member of family over the past year....and good flea markets are rather rare in Asia...<br><br>I think you girls are right about community work though...and I shall try to be more proactive in finding volunteer work on short-term basis...<br><br>Cookie &amp; Monoslayer: Aiyoh....not all tai-tais are like Gabrielle from "Desperate Housewives" looking to score a gardener or plumber!! I am very happily married <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm not a housewife, but I've got friends who are.  Aside from the activities you've described, some of them also enjoy playing online games.  A word of caution though - online games are very addictive so play in moderation please.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Or if that's not for u, perhaps you could put your language skills &amp; travel experiences to good use by working as a freelance tour guide.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  Might need to take a little course, but it's a great way to meet new people and share experiences.. hard to get bored too.. could be worth your while.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Nomadica:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi, I'm a 27-year-old housewife who has been travelling with my husband around Asia for the past year. We usually stay in a city for 2-4 months then move on to another, due to the nature of his work.<br><br>As such, I've been unable to find a job after resigning from my job in Singapore. Call it the Singaporean Curse, but I am someone who enjoys working very much. I've tried to keep myself occupied by learning a fourth language and attending classes on yoga, knitting, flower arrangement etc. but these are more like time-fillers than activities that give deep fulfillment.<br>There is still a void in my heart that I cannot seem to fill.<br><br>While I do enjoy being a housewife and caring for my husband, I resent waking up everyday and not having goals. I've considered free-lance writing, and community work...but these have not come to fruition due to the short period of stay in each city. I've only managed to do some free-lance translation work, but that is not frequent enough to keep me occupied. Worse, moving from city to city means that I've not been able to build up an immediate circle of friends. My husband travels very frequently (average 2 times a week) which leaves me very lonely.<br><br>We don't plan to have kids for another 1-2 years, so I'm likely to have plenty of time on my hands till then.<br><br>What do you girls do to fill up your time? HELP!!<span style="color: violet;"></span></div></blockquote> wat is ur hubby's occupation??? which cities u n ur hubby goes to for his work?</div>
