            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>I was listening to this old song by one of my favourite singer, Zhao Yong Hua, entitled "I love u but only until here..". Something came to my mind when this song played, perhaps, weaved by the tales of my fellow friends, there came many questions to me.<br><br>Perhaps, I just want to get some personal perspective to the questions which passed my mind : is it true when a woman decided on something, no matter what a man tried to do to mend back everything, she would never turn back? Is it really so simple for a woman who can wield the blade to cut away all the strings, the strings where all that the couple been thru? Is it true that even if the guy would be able to persist and make all the effort to reconcile, there is no more chance? So, is it true that I love u but only until here?<br><br>If loving someone was to leave him, would it hurt both of you? If Fate has brought you together, then why part if u still care for the person and he still care for you?<br><br>So many questions, perhaps, the ladies could give me some insight to these questions...<br><br>Do take care.<br><br>yours,<br>Prodigal<br><br>"If love was ever a choice, who would choose exquisite pain?"<br>- Jodie Foster, "Anna and the King"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Prodigal,<br><br>If for one day you can stop thinking about issues regarding love and relationships, you might be a happier person.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Anyway, I think the issue here would be why did the girl leave the guy in the first place? Was it the fault of the guy? Did the guy do something to make the girl totally disheartened, heartbroken, betrayed etc? If so, then for me, no matter how much the guy pleads, I will not turn back. In this case, by doing what the guy had done, did he consider those times that he and I went through together? Those months/years of togetherness, of love and concern, of each otherÂ’s time? He would be the one who had cut away the strings which held the two together, so if it was me, IÂ’d be selfish. Leave him, and never return no matter what he says, how much he pleads, whatever. In fact, the more he persists, the more IÂ’d be put off by him.<br><br>In other cases in which the girl leaves the guy for other reasons, such as, misunderstandings, bad habits of the guy, circumstantial reasons etc., I think whether or not I will turn back really depends on how much I still feel for him and trust him. If the feelings are no longer there, seriously, thereÂ’s no point turning back coz I think itÂ’s the feelings that will create the bonding in a relationship. Now, even if thereÂ’s still feelings, IÂ’d ask myself, do I trust him not to repeat what he has done (which in the first place made me leave him). If, for example, I left him because heÂ’s such a gambler, do I trust him enough to stop gambling for the sake of the relationship? Or am I willing to put up with it? If the answer is no for either case, then no point turning back as well. Love is not everything, and why waste your life on someone whom you no longer feel for or whom you can no longer trust?<br><br>I think that there is no such thing as unconditional love. It only exists in a perfect world, and the perfect world does not exist. So what if we had spent X number of years together? One should always look into the future, and not the past. Learn from the previous relationship and move on. (this is similar to the finance perspective of only considering future cashflows in valuing investments when making investment decisions, and all sunken costs should not be considered  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">.)<br><br>From someone whoÂ’s quite disillusioned by the concept of love.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, Sparkle,<br><br>To see such a reasonable and long reply is indeed rare consider it's coming from you, I am sure that u should archive it for your own future purposes. *grin*<br><br>Perhaps, the point of all these questions is to re-evaluate whether there still exists unconditional love in this world. Perhaps, it exists but because the collective believe otherwise, it ceases to exist. One chooses to believe what they want to see. To me, this kind of questions do not matter anymore (u will understand when I write one of the special threads in my 1314th post), but to the people around me, who are still stuck in these problems. Perhaps, experience also tell me that when a woman made up her mind, no matter how hard a man try, no miracles can happen. I am just wondering whether there is still a miracle for some other people I know out there.<br><br>Seriously and truthfully speaking and not into one of those crazy modes, I am quite happy for the time being with my life, even though the special someone has not appeared in my life, with or without her. U will be surprised how much have changed when u last heard from me, because the next time you see me, it would not be the same again.. *confident smile*<br><br>Thanks for sharing anyway.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>yours sincerely,<br>Prodigal<br><br>"Dogma is the root of all evil when a person forgets why he started to believe a refutable truth as an absolute truth."<br>- Prodigal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Prodigal,<br><br>Funny you should ask this question.  I was chatting with a guy friend about something similar to this topic.  His question to me was "Will I ever give the guy a second chance?"<br><br>Call me harsh, call me cold-hearted, but I won't.  Why?  I believe in life there are many thing that is more important than love to me.  I hate to get hurt, hey, who doesn't rt?!  If I was to break up with a guy then it will means that I am very hurt by him.  So hurt that I don't know how to handle it and decide to run away from it all.  I don't think I will break up with the guy over little misunderstandings or issues though...unless there are many times that I have complained and he refuse to change.  But then again, if I really love him, I will be able to accpet.  If he was the dumper than...I will NEVER want to patch things back with him.  It might be over little misunderstanding that he breaks up with me, but if he can break up with me over little misunderstandings, then it already shows that he doesn't trust me enough.  And if it's over some bad habit of mine and I am not able to change then it's really up to him to adapt to it or forget about me...and plus, I don't want to hurt him because I am not able to change to suit him.<br><br>I am afraid to get hurt.  I don't like to look back at a relationship and try to mend things back when I was once hurted by the guy.  I would rather just move on and start another relationship fresh.  It's one thing to get hurt, but it's another thing to get hurt by the same guy twice....<br><br>------------------<br>Float like a butterfly...Sting like a bee...</div>
