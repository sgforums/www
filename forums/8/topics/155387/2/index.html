            <div class='col-md body'>thats why...this kind of "looking for trouble" type...always think they big enough to 'eat' you..either they big-sized...look fierce....or walk in large groups...its like appeasing their ego...thats the main problem with bullies...no matter is it in school...on the bus...orchard rd or just your neighbourhood prata shop...they always looking for something to appease their ego...they find a nerd kid...beat him up...den will become more and more confident and arrogant...starts looking for another target and a vicious cycle continues...<br><br><strong>its a truth in sociaty yet the government can't do nuts about it...</strong><br><br>sometimes...the right technique and skill to get yourself out of this kind of situation is vital...you can either talk nicely...try your best to explain...if not...sometimes...resorting to your "second most trusted" part of the body is unavoidable... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
