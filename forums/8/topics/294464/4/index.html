            <div class='col-md body'>Some how, here the reply is like no money no talk basis ...  is all the girl care for is to live a comfortable life?  25 years ago, I wasn't earning much too hardly today $1.5 k standard.  ... my wife pay is slightly higher than mine but still low .. we were registered and only go through customary marriage when I stike 4D ( pathetic) right?  My wife knew I was poor but she chose to marry me.  One of the saddest moment I never forget was, when my daughter was about 3 years old and she craved for durain.  We were left with $10.00 but we decided to use that $10 to buy the one durain for our girl.  Such was the poverty stage we were in ..  still we were happy together and we work hard..  We started going oversea holidays, buying new car etc a few years later ... then recession set in and the last and I lost my job and so do my wife ...  we still stick together and we worked together..<br><br>Look TS, you have to wait for the right girl to come.  If you are rich and girls come to you...  but when you are down, will she be there for you..  if dispite you are poor and the girl stick to you, you know she will be there when you needed it..  you need to meet more girl and you have to stop asking if girl marry you with a 1k salary ...  you should look for girl who want to build a home and not one with home ready, in this instant ...  all the best to you ...  oh... next week is my 25 years marriage with me wife ...  for your infor, I cannot afford to buy her any present and I do not expect any from her too .. cause we are now starting to recover from the last depression...<br><br></div>

And I believe there are still many SG girls who would marry guys who make less than 1k/mth. It's a matter of compromise in expenses and lifestyle wat... And most importantly, it's the choice of the girl; and you should know better... it's almost imossible to understand what really goes on in their heads...!<br><br>the income issue is not really a problem la... something that disturbs me more is the increase in angmoh-singaporean marriages/relationships these days... My question is: Do SG girls actually prefer foreign flavours so much more that they find local guys boring...??!? And if yes, then how did they derived this perception and get so white-washed?<br><br></div></blockquote>There are good Singaporean guys around but all I know of are married or about to get married.<br><br>Why do you care who goes out with who? As long as two persons love each other - who is to say anything else?<br><br></div>
