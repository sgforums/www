My wife knew I was poor but she chose to marry me.  One of the saddest moment I never forget was, when my daughter was about 3 years old and she craved for durain.  We were left with $10.00 but we decided to use that $10 to buy the one durain for our girl.  Such was the poverty stage we were in ..  still we were happy together and we work hard..  We started going oversea holidays, buying new car etc a few years later ... then recession set in and the last and I lost my job and so do my wife ...  we still stick together and we worked together..<br><br>Look TS, you have to wait for the right girl to come.  If you are rich and girls come to you...  but when you are down, will she be there for you..  if dispite you are poor and the girl stick to you, you know she will be there when you needed it..  you need to meet more girl and you have to stop asking if girl marry you with a 1k salary ...  you should look for girl who want to build a home and not one with home ready, in this instant ...  all the best to you ...  oh... next week is my 25 years marriage with me wife ...  for your infor, I cannot afford to buy her any present and I do not expect any from her too .. cause we are now starting to recover from the last depression...<br><br></div></blockquote>You are describing a different generation. At that time possibly many were poor and looked at working hard to improve their lives. Today's savvy generation looks at proofing their lives and their economic future so that when they lose their jobs, they do not have to worry because they have other sources. They work smart now, they have investments that continue to generate money, even when they are not working.<br></div>
