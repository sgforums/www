              <p>For the record, it's spelled as 'adultery'  :p</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's not a 'business' cos there's no $$ transaction. If there's money involved, things will be much easier!</p>
              <p><br>Can't discuss much cos never read that blog.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But curiosity and sex is something we all have and need. Most guys are more sensitive with their physical (sexual) needs and may allow that to overrule their emotional and moral obligations. Especially for a peelot who spends his time with his crew more often than his family.</p>
              <p>And not to put down air crew, but the smart ones dun stay there for long. What's left are the pretty one and those with different goals in life.</p>
              <p>Breaking it down further, if you enjoy a conventional good o' family life, you won't stay as an aircrew with erratic schedule for long. That said, aircrew have a certain demogrpahic pattern.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>They are open-minded cos of their exposure and peusdo understanding of world cultures during the course of their work. <br></li>
              <li>They have financial freedom that gives them a false sense of power.<br></li>
              <li>They started young and are not grounded (no pun intended) by conventional ethics - maybe they know what service is but there's no sense of long term ownership of a project or responsibilty. Pretty much individualism and upmanship.</li>
              <li>They have queer working culture (the SQ senority culture) that toughen them the wrong way and define what's right and wrong to them.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Now, it's fun to bed an aircrew for the fun of bedding an aircrew if I have no family or other commitments or social responsibilities, and possess a huge bed with long wooden poles for me to carve my scores and a huge brimmed hat for me to plant my feathers. It's a common guy fantasy.</p>
              <p>The question is, how to align my fantasy to responsibility and morality?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With all due respect, I have many friends who are/were aircrew and there are exceptions to what I had said above. Just for our discussion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Screw them. The sky's the limit.</p>

              <p>The sad and weak part about adult women here is that they seem to be easily conned by conmen, they fell into their sweet talks and believe in everything they said, then after a few round of sex, these women ask for love, marriage and have a family, kind of normal women dream. Then the men start to say i got family but i still love you, we just be sex partners all those pathetic stuffs, these lead to pain and suffering for women. Very unfair.</p>

              <p><br>ya, cos the pilot never call the co- pilot to join in..</p>
              <p>and the wife never inform her husband that the steward wants to join in too. And finally the air stewardess did not invite the air steward. Adultery is a very messy issue.</p>
