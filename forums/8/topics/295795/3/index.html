I'm almost positive you just made that up, in fact people in the 80s and 90s were generally richer because back then you could buy more with the same amout of money ($1 back then was worth a lot more than $1 is now, and the amount people earn hasn't gone up enough to make up for it). So it's actually the opposite of what you're saying and stop blaming the west lol</div>

I'm almost positive you just made that up, in fact people in the 80s and 90s were generally richer because back then you could buy more with the same amout of money ($1 back then was worth a lot more than $1 is now, and the amount people earn hasn't gone up enough to make up for it).
