            <div class='col-md body'>Following the 'recent' announcement of Singapore becoming a DEVELOPED country, we have come to be gained GLOBAL RECOGNITION in our STATUS but at the same time, stripped of our advantages. I think having Singapore move on globally and to develop in line and gain recognition and power is IMPORTANT for its FUTURE... Provided that there is a FUTURE?<br><br>The IDEA of Singapore becoming a DEVELOPED country and YET a 'friendly' country fellowship really gives me the laugh of the day. As Singapore begin to dive into its FUTURE and was told to be responsible for self-development and care-taking, we were also told to CARE for the other Singapore citizens. The FACT as mentioned by many other individuals, in Singapore, if you can't 'hit the list' you're out of the game. So those who are FINALLY out of the game, what happens to them? Other Singaporeans take care of them? What if MAJORITY of the Singaporeans are DOWN? Who's gonna take care of them?<br><br>Moving on to the next issue of AIDS. One of the MOST FEARSOME disease of the century. As a DEVELOPED country, Singaporeans cannot enjoy the benefit of CHEAP treatment. And Singapore government don't subsidise treatments, stating that it's a WASTE(?) of the public fund. Emphasizing on education and prevention. No doubt I have to admit that EDUCATION and PREVENTION are GREAT IDEAs. But it'll be a WHILE before that would work? How about treatment? Research and Development? Ministry of Health argument of 'against elevating Aids into a favoured category whereby Aids patients enjoy additional public subsidies and medical treatment'. I wanna emphasize that IF you're a PATIENT, of course you would enjoy MORE medical benefits. If you're NOT a patient (in general), you DON'T. Does that mean that Singaporeans should learn to take care of their own health if not they would be using up ADDITIONAL government fund on MEDICATION and TREATMENT? Viewing countries like Malaysia and Thailand in the region would are INSTEAD putting in much more effort on treatment of the disease and reduction of the cost of drugs, is Singapore such a DEVELOPED country to be moving BACKWARDS in its medical direction towards this NEW DISEASE? No doubt that the percentage population of people developing AIDS in Singapore is still RELATIVELY LOW as compared to the other countries, if EDUCATION don't work hand in hand with TREATMENT. It's just like fighting a war by writing on a piece of paper. If it's GENUINE CONCERN of a SPIRIT to fight a NEW DISEASE, why don't we do it FULL-FORCE like we used to? Are we gonna RISK the kind of CONTROL over a DISEASE over our country? And no doubt people might be thinking how those people DESERVES it, but TRUST ME.. If there're gonna be NEW DISEASE coming in in the future, you'll need a STANDARD RESPONSE against it.. Just like an IMMUNE SYSTEM.. Not such picky decisions on 'yes' or 'no'... UNLESS lives ain't that important anymore? But if you see it in such a way, AIDS carriers can't bring a NEXT GENERATION to Singapore? All they can be done is DRAINED of wealth and DISCARDED... That's another issue altogether...<br><br>Singapore is a NEWLY DEVELOPED country... It would need ALOT more to move it into the FUTURE... Alot of more STANDARD PROCEDUREs to 'treatment'... More UNIFIED thinking and decision makings.... We can be considered to be at a disadvantage at this growing point of our nation... But how far would we be reaching out in the FUTURE would not only depends on the NEXT GENERATION... But our MINDSET.... And how our MINDSET are 'EDUCATED'....?<br><br></div>
