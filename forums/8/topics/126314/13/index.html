            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by kheldorin:<br>If you read the article I posted again, China's education distorted facts about the atomic bomb attack on Japan, the war on Tibet and Vietnam. Some even thought that Chinese resistance was the cause of Japan's surrender. I'm sure Americans, Japanese, Tibetans and Vietnamese will be glad to hear that. As you aptly put, this is a flagrant display of utter disrespect for those countries.<br></blockquote>About the Chinese history books, granted the Chinese government may have disrespected other countries with their versions of history, but which country in this world does not have border disputes with the neighbours? Which country does not seek to explain its own position in such disputes? Before we answer that question, let us first look at China's past relations with their neighbours in an objective manner:<br><br>Even under the current Communist regime, China has not been expansionist. The various border quarrels that led to brief outbreaks of shooting thirty or forty years ago with the Soviet Union, India, and Vietnam were driven by genuine boundary disputes and prickly Chinese nationalism, but the territories at issue were not large or important. China's forces never pushed past the specific territories they claimed, and in most cases they were withdrawn again after making their point. China's occupation of Tibet and its claim to Taiwan are both contentious issues, but they are seen in Beijing essentially as domestic issues having to do with the country's historic territorial integrity.<br><br>Your Seoul Times article also mentioned that China is slowly opening up and improving history education. "Once taboo subjects, like the Chinese Nationalists' contribution during the war against Japan and even the Cultural Revolution are being mentioned." Even after the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade was bombed by US, and a Chinese fighter jet pilot was killed off Hainan in a collision with an American spy plane, the Chinese government have been tolerant and have maintained friendly relations with US. Recent events like Wen Jiabao's visit to India and the Chinese Embassy's grave-sweeping exercise in Vietnam (see <a href="http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2005-04-10/21015610663s.shtml" rel="nofollow">article</a>) have proven the Chinese government's sincerity to improve border relations with the neighbours and the US.<br><br>Now look at what the Japanese government is doing.</div>

I think it is more because of their nationalistic feelings. Think about it, i have great grand parents who died in the war, i have grand parents who were shot in the war. But i don't really feel their kind of pain mainly because i hardly knew them. 60 years. Even those old dudes are mostly dead already. Not possible for this kind of hatred to go through 2 generations.Unless they were educated throughout their lives to hate the japanese.</div>

Perhaps the feeling is not that intense now, but on the whole, they still don't like the french.<br><br>So ultimately, it just fall on the lines of do on others what you expect others to do onto yourself. If you treat them well, no complains. You treat them like hell, they will treat you like hell. And thats human nature.<br><br>As for the reasons why most singaporeans don't really care i can probably list down a few.<br><br>1.Generally, we find that the war is too distant from us and there is nothing there that reminds us of the past hatred . The media don't fan up the flames, the old folks are already gone. All we see are pictures in text books which are very factual. We are not taught to hate them in general.<br><br>2.The Japanese culture has more or less wrapped up with our lives. Everything, from food, to the tv programmes we watch, to the games we play, to some people, they have see the japanese in a different kind of light. It is no longer that war mongering kind of culture we are seeing. Now we are looking at a much more peaceful japan.<br><br>3.They have not "arrowed" singapore yet. Right now they deny that the rape of nanking happened. So this is between china and japan. But lets say they decide to deny that the changi massacre did not happen, or they did not kidnap girls in SEA to be comfort women, or the death railway was a total lie, then you will see an uproar from the whole of asean.<br><br>4. We were brought up in a society where riots and protest are totally non existant. So beside what you see in the internet, you won't really see any<br>riots on the streets.<br><br></div></blockquote>true.... maybe cos our old ah kongs and ah ma's die much earlier (wah laoz jap and china ah kong and ah mas can live untill 90odd lehz) and we dun really interact much with them... plus we are generally a very peacful and socially civillised(i mean civillised as in quiet and emotionally rather settled bout things like that)<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by activator:</div><div class="quote_body"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br>u r asking chinese pple to forgive someone that came to their ctr to rape their sisters and mothers, killed their brothers n fathers, and DENY that such acts was committed?!<br>Imagine that someone was YOU?!<br><br>To deny that tis qwas committed simply allows themn e easy way out!<br>I dom not hate the japanese people noir their products!!<br>But i cant tolerate their politicians guts to twist history!<br>I rem studying hist in schools years back and when WW2 was taught...i was almost reduced to tears&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; </div></blockquote>hey the jap goverment does deny it but alot of my jap friends hate thier "war heros" for creating such attrocities at that time of the war... the even hate the whole idea ok kamikazi... but hey... people repent and if they do, we should forgive them for that.... though i'm not a christian and everything but what they preach is logical and rational... if an appogy is needed, i belive many of the jap soldiers have personally gone back to where they commited those sins and sincerly appoligized to the people... if u want them to suffer the wrath that we suffered, wont they feel the same way as u do? and then this hatered will never stop... my great grandma happens to one of those "ladies" btw... and she never hated them for some actually appoligized before they left... worst some even killed themselves... maybe its just me but i come from a generally peaceful family... as my grandparents have always tot me to forgive and forget... never use violence and everything can be setteled peacefully...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> hard to follow though.... but still it help me solved alot of things without having to get into a fight  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by kheldorin:<br>The problem with this discussion is that you keep on arguing on minor points while glossing over the major ones. So, let me restate again. I think that what the Japanese government is doing is wrong but protests are not the solution to this problem.</blockquote>Let's focus on major ones then, though I don't remember anywhere in my posts stating protests to be solution to the problem. Where did you say that was again?<br><br>Anyone with a decent bit of conscience would know that what the Japanese government is doing is wrong. However, if the Japanese could exercise their own right to disrespect China by twisting history, couldn't the Chinese exercise their own right to tell Japan that they do not condone those actions too? Fathers and brothers have been killed, mothers and sisters have been raped. Old wounds have been re-opened, where family honour is at stake naturally emotions run high.<br><br>How else would you expect the Chinese to behave? Wait for the government to summon the Japanese ambassador so that both parties can just at least show angry faces at the TV camera? Sit civilly in front of their computers and chat in chatrooms, "Aiya, relax lah... the Japanese schools maybe won't use the textbook anyway"? Put up their hands and implore to the heavens, "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do"? Or just take ten deep breaths, say "woo-sah..." while exhaling and carry on life as normal?<br><br>Withholding the truth is as good as supporting the lie. As mentioned in an <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=126314&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">earlier thread</a>, "mute acceptance of the Japanese actions is tantamount to the acknowledgement of <span style="font-style: italic;">their</span> version of history." Somebody has got to tell the Japanese not to test their neighbours' patience, and who better to rely on than the offended neighbours themselves? (Speaking of which, what's to stop the Vietnamese and Americans from protesting against the Chinese history textbooks if they wanted to?)<br><br>The unruly mob behaviour of the protesters have made their cause look bad. Since this is not the first time the Japanese government have taunted the neighbours, many protesters are also aware that protests are not the solution to the problem (Is there even a solution to the problem?) and the Japanese government is not going to change. However, just because it is not a solution doesn't mean people shouldn't do it. Not every single thing that we do in life must solve problems. No solution to the problem? No problem. How about making a stand instead? And if protests are the fastest and most direct way to unite the people together and make a stand, then why not? Protests can be peaceful, too.<br><br>Action speaks louder than words. Some may object the protests and criticise the Chinese of not being undiplomatic, but at least nobody could accuse the Chinese of being hypocrites. Which is more than what many could say for some other country.</div>
