Most of them were situated in areas of large Chinese populous. Among them were Java Road, Arab Street, Telok Kurau English School, St. Joseph's Institution, and Chinatown.<br><br>At the Chinatown screening centre, lorries were parked nearby ready to take anti-Japanese suspects to remote locations such as Changi, Punggol and Bedok, where they were all massacred.<br><br>The lucky ones were stamped with an "examined" word on their faces, arms, clothing or just pieces of paper. They were free to return home to their families afterwards.<br><br>We do not know how many men were executed during the Sook Ching exercise.<br><br>When the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce, Appeal Committee for Singapore Chinese Victims Massacred by Japanese, attempted to investigate by urging people to report deaths of family members and relatives, only 8600 were reported.<br><br>Research have shown that there were many more.<br><br>Whatever the number is, Sook Ching will, remain a horrific and traumatic experience in the memory of the survivors.<br><br>http://www.s1942.org.sg/dir_defence7.htm</div></blockquote>actually the sook ching, i would say that they did the logical thing even if its not a good thing to do, all they did was kill their enemies and try to stamp out opposition. stamping out of opposition we are seeing all over the world now though perhaps with not so extreme methods, but if you take into account its war and you don't have the leisure to do it in slower ways, its still a rather acceptable solution if you look at it objectively and without high morals.<br><br>tw don't bother to flame me i don't really care and i'm just stating my analysis of the event, i feel we shouldn't let our emotions dictate our actions</div>

How are they going to expect others to forgive and forget when they are living in denial of the past? My view is not of teh one that japanese must apologise, but they must not whitewash and glorify its disgraceful past. Instead, they should face the truth like a man, not a coward.<br><br>I would just like all that the japanese people has its part to play, even though not entirely. They could have at least encouraged the government to face up to truth and admit its wrongdoings, but what has been achieved even in this internet world?<br><br>I used to suscribe to the 'forgive and forget' mentality too, until i get to learn a lot of young japanese didn't even know about their war attrocities. Doing wrong is one thing. Denying it is another. Glorifying it is absloutely disgusting and insulting.<br><br>But i hold my view that Japan is definitely a very dangerous nation to live with.<br><br></div>

How are they going to expect others to forgive and forget when they are living in denial of the past? My view is not of teh one that japanese must apologise, but they must not whitewash and glorify its disgraceful past. Instead, they should face the truth like a man, not a coward.<br><br>I would just like all that the japanese people has its part to play, even though not entirely. They could have at least encouraged the government to face up to truth and admit its wrongdoings, but what has been achieved even in this internet world?<br><br>I used to suscribe to the 'forgive and forget' mentality too, until i get to learn a lot of young japanese didn't even know about their war attrocities. Doing wrong is one thing. Denying it is another. Glorifying it is absloutely disgusting and insulting.<br><br>But i hold my view that Japan is definitely a very dangerous nation to live with.<br><br></div></blockquote>I can imagine 100 years from now, Japanese will be accusing us of distorting history.<br></div>
