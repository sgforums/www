            <div class='col-md body'>so what if they started the war, they've contributed so much more to the world than they had destroyed, true that their forefathers started the war, but that was already back in ancient tiems when technology was not as advanced, their thinking are not as sensible as we are today. the new jap generation may not know of what horrible things their ancestors did, but isnt it better that way? ppl hv said that they hv forgiven but did not forget, don forgive means to nv bring it up agn, by bombing them means they've received their punishment, what is this now? punishment round 2?<br>even if there really is gonna be fighting, u ask ppl these days if they know anything abt volunteering for the army, they would say nth even if they did, who would wanto fight agn after all the bs thats happen.<br>and cmon lets face it, we need the japs, how many of u drive toyotas, use jap made appliances etc etc? afterall what we learnt in history txtbks says that hitler started the war and were recruiting allies, so shouldnt u blame russia instead?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by mujiland:<br>but i dun read japanese and never seen or read the books, have you?<br></blockquote>Mujiland, most of the Chinese and Koreans have also never seen or read the textbooks, but they have seen or read the news like the article mentioned in <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=126138&amp;page=2" rel="nofollow">another thread</a>.<br><br>In a nutshell, below are the modifications made to latest editions of the textbooks on the Sino-Japanese war, as compared to the less distorted previous editions:<br><br>1. "Comfort women" (female sex slaves of mostly Chinese and Korean origin who were forced to serve as "public toilets" for the Japanese army in the field) is now omitted.<br><br>2. Forced Asian labour brought to Japan is now voluntary Asian labour.<br><br>3. Death toll in Rape of Nanjing is now trivialised from figures to "many".<br><br>Some may side with the Japanese and find these modifications trivial, but to those whose fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters have suffered or sacrificed under the boot of the Japanese imperial army, such modification of historical facts is an affront to their families.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by mujiland:<br>why freeze ourselves in time just to wonder what and why, shouldn't we be moving on and stop worrying about history?<br></blockquote>I don't think the Chinese and Koreans are freezing themselves in time and getting worked up over something that is long dead and buried. As I've also pointed out in <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=126480&amp;page=0" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>, when the Japanese government alter history to suit their political purpose, teach their young such distorted history, and these young grow up to be the next generations of Japan leaders, it becomes a genuine concern for the neighbouring countries.<br><br>Recent history has shown us, both in Communist China and Nazi Germany, how powerful education can be when manipulated to be a twisted political tool, and none of us wants to see history repeating itself in the form of an expansionist Japan. One way of preventing the effect from happening in the future is to stop the possible cause in the present.</div>

(This issue has already been addressed in <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=126706" rel="nofollow">another thread</a>, though there was a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/1443233.stm" rel="nofollow">BBC article</a> that did not seem to support it.) That year, the schools only rejected 1 as they had many others to choose from.<br><br>4 years have gone by since then, and the government has released a list of approved textbooks, most of which (according to a <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/04/06/news/letter.html" rel="nofollow">Japanese correspondent</a> in the online edition of the International Herald Tribune newspaper on April 7 2005) "reflect what many in and outside Japan see as a further shift to the right."<br><br>How an article written in 2001 could be used as a basis to forecast events happening in 2005, I do not know. But I do know that my recent posts have pointed to news articles -- any reader could click on the links to read for themselves if they're bothered -- and they're not from Xinhua news agency. If you think what I have written comes from a textbook, pray tell how you managed to conceive the fascinating idea that I could quote, from a textbook, things that were written only a few days ago.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by kheldorin:<br>And if you guys are truly concerned about education in foreign countries, why don't you protest about the lack of education about the Tianenmen Square incident, Tibet's claims, etc.....

A country may tailor its own textbooks, it may downplay the body count of its own civil wars, that is its own business. However, when it trivialises the death tolls of the other countries it invaded in attempt to hide its shame, that is no longer its own business but a flagrant display of utter disrespect for those countries.</div>
