The Japanese work ethics is admirable, their dedication to quality is laudable.<br><br>The bone of contention is not with the culture, however. The motive behind the Chinese and Korean boycott is a protest against the adamant refusal of the Japanese to acknowledge the atrocities committed by their expansionist-minded forefathers during World War II. It is indeed time to forgive and many would want to forgive, but forgiveness is meaningless and redundant when the perpetrators do not acknowlege the wrongs committed.<br><br>Chinese: "We forgive you..."<br>Japanese: "Forgive us for what? We deserve gratitude, not forgiveness."<br><br>It is debatable whether the bombs dropped at Hiroshima and Nagasaki were acts of retribution. Many historians, especially Americans, consider the bombs as a desperate measure to bring the proud, rather-die-than-surrender Japanese to their knees, to stop the war from prolonging any further. It is possible that without the two bombs in 1945, Singaporeans would be studying their textbooks in Japanese today.</div></blockquote>Well said, my friend!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>Feb 15th 1942 - Remembering the Fall of Singapore (2)<br><br>February 23, 2005<br><br>In our first edition, we traced the last few weeks leading up to fall of Singapore. We revisited some of the sites of the fiercely fought battles and also recalled the gallant efforts of the men and women who died defending Singapore right up to February 15th 1942 and who now lay buried at the Kranji Commonwealth War cemetery.<br><br>BF: Â“For me as a military historian, its one of the more dramatic days of the 2nd World War when the British and their Commonwealth allies were forced to surrender Singapore and relinquish the naval base to the JapaneseÂ”.<br><br>Brian Farrell is an Associate Professor in the History Department at the National University of Singapore where he teaches military history.<br><br>...............................................<br><br>This Civilian War Memorial is unique in the sense that it has four pillars representing the different races in Singapore Â– Chinese, Malays, Indians and Eurasians. But for the past 38 years, weÂ’ve witnessed solemn services being held at this memorial, but I must ask you this question, do you think the young people of Singapore, will they understand and appreciate what youÂ’ve just narrated for our listeners and beyond that, will they in turn remember long after you and I are gone?<br><br>AP: Â“Well the Chinese Chambers has this yearly memorial service on the 15th February and this service is always well attended by students. Normally we have thousand over students from various schools, tertiary institutions, we have council members, diplomatic corp, veterans, even prisoners of war from Australia, New Zealand and UK, as well as families of the victims attending this memorial service. This yearly memorial service serves as a constant reminder to our younger generation who have never experienced the atrocities of war to bear in mind those people who have sacrificed their life for the sake of peace. I think only with knowledge can the young generation appreciate the peace we have now as well as value of freedom and the importance of self reliance in the defence of our countryÂ”.<br><br>TK: Â“It will be very sad if our younger generation donÂ’t remember it because the war thought us that we have to rely on ourselves, we are a small nation, we are very vulnerable, and that war is never nice, itÂ’s a very ugly thingÂ”.<br><br>http://www.rsi.com.sg/english/assignment/view/20050223075528/1/.html</div>
