If we are humble enough, we should have the courage to admit our mistakes and beg for forgiveness.

(This issue has already been addressed in another thread, though there was a BBC article that did not seem to support it.) That year, the schools only rejected 1 as they had many others to choose from.<br></div></blockquote>A bit late. Too many threads. I think you misunderstood the BBC article. The BBC article stated that a local board of education rejected the district education education panel's choice. While the LaserLordz article said that most district education panel chose to reject it. There is no contradiction. I restate: "And as your article points out, even if the district panel chose that particular book, some schools chose to reject it. " When I meant your article, I was referring to the BBC one. All evidence points out that the textbook is not widely received. And since the new textbooks was recently approved, you won't know how it is going to be widely received in the future. Be reminded that these textbooks will be released for 2006. So, what can we do is to infer from the past reaction of the Japanese people. The past reaction is that it is widely rejected.<br><br>Even now, scholars in Japan and Korea are working together on another alternative textbook.<br><a href="http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/200504/kt2005040716524968040.htm" rel="nofollow">http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/200504/kt2005040716524968040.htm</a><br>The Japanese people have a huge say in what textbook is used unlike in certain non-democratic countries. I think most people underestimate the Japanese if they think that they are easily manipulated by government propaganda.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Tuatau:</div><div class="quote_body">Wrong analogy. A country may tailor its own textbooks, it may downplay the body count of its own civil wars, that is its own business. However, when it trivialises the death tolls of the other countries it invaded in attempt to hide its shame, that is no longer its own business but a flagrant display of utter disrespect for those countries.<br></div></blockquote>If you read the article I posted again, China's education distorted facts about the atomic bomb attack on Japan, the war on Tibet and Vietnam. Some even thought that Chinese resistance was the cause of Japan's surrender. I'm sure Americans, Japanese, Tibetans and Vietnamese will be glad to hear that. As you aptly put, this is a flagrant display of utter disrespect for those countries.<br></div>

It admitted, and the jews just shut up. If not, you would have seen a seres of assasination attempts by the israeli commandos.<br><br>As for what you said about the british, imo, the british were very nice colonial masters as compared to the french or the dutch. They believe in the welfare of the locals whereas the other colonial masters frequently persecuted the locals. So thats why for those under the british, they generally don't feel the hatred.<br><br>But if you take the vietnamese, it is a different story they don't like the french. Perhaps the feeling is not that intense now, but on the whole, they still don't like the french.<br><br>So ultimately, it just fall on the lines of do on others what you expect others to do onto yourself. If you treat them well, no complains. You treat them like hell, they will treat you like hell. And thats human nature.<br><br>As for the reasons why most singaporeans don't really care i can probably list down a few.<br><br>1.Generally, we find that the war is too distant from us and there is nothing there that reminds us of the past hatred . The media don't fan up the flames, the old folks are already gone. All we see are pictures in text books which are very factual. We are not taught to hate them in general.<br><br>2.The Japanese culture has more or less wrapped up with our lives. Everything, from food, to the tv programmes we watch, to the games we play, to some people, they have see the japanese in a different kind of light. It is no longer that war mongering kind of culture we are seeing. Now we are looking at a much more peaceful japan.<br><br>3.They have not "arrowed" singapore yet. Right now they deny that the rape of nanking happened. So this is between china and japan. But lets say they decide to deny that the changi massacre did not happen, or they did not kidnap girls in SEA to be comfort women, or the death railway was a total lie, then you will see an uproar from the whole of asean.<br><br>4. We were brought up in a society where riots and protest are totally non existant. So beside what you see in the internet, you won't really see any<br>riots on the streets.<br><br></div>

In a <strong>rare</strong> move, a local board of education in Tochigi prefecture...  rejected a recommendation by a district educational panel to use the history book.</span><br><br>Don't wish to nitpick over words, but singling out 30 out of the thousands of schools and the word "rare" hardly gave one the impression that majority of the schools rejected the controversial history textbook. Not to mention the article didn't even explicitly talk about the majority reaction in Japan.<br><br>Anyway, as discussed in <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=126706" rel="nofollow">another thread</a>, this time round the list of approved textbooks reflected "what many in and outside Japan see as a further shift to the right." The schools might have rejected one and picked others in 2001, but could they reject the whole list and pick none in 2005?<br><br>Certainly we could "infer from the past reaction of the Japanese people". When people consider the Japanese to be "easily manipulated by government propaganda", that's precisely what they are doing -- inferring from the past reaction of the Japanese people. World War II history has proven indeed that the Japanese could be and have been "easily manipulated by government propoganda".</div>
