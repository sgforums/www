The Japanese work ethics is admirable, their dedication to quality is laudable.<br><br>The bone of contention is not with the culture, however. The motive behind the Chinese and Korean boycott is a protest against the adamant refusal of the Japanese to acknowledge the atrocities committed by their expansionist-minded forefathers during World War II. It is indeed time to forgive and many would want to forgive, but forgiveness is meaningless and redundant when the perpetrators do not acknowlege the wrongs committed.<br><br>Chinese: "We forgive you..."<br>Japanese: "Forgive us for what? We deserve gratitude, not forgiveness."<br><br>It is debatable whether the bombs dropped at Hiroshima and Nagasaki were acts of retribution. Many historians, especially Americans, consider the bombs as a desperate measure to bring the proud, rather-die-than-surrender Japanese to their knees, to stop the war from prolonging any further. It is possible that without the two bombs in 1945, Singaporeans would be studying their textbooks in Japanese today.</div></blockquote>you are wrong.  US could have won the war against japan in the conventional way.  the reason for dropping the atomic bombs was to serve a warning to russia, not japan.<br><br></div>

Think about it, sent your own forces, fight a long war and cause many of your own casualties or drop a bomb, save your own forces and not waste too much resources fighting the war, which is better?</div>

US could have won the war against japan in the conventional way.  the reason for dropping the atomic bombs was to serve a warning to russia, not japan.<br></blockquote>Like what Coolmyth said, that could be another reason, but it's argumentative. Let's look at the facts instead:<br><br>More than 400,000 American soldiers have already died in World War II. Almost 700,000 American soldiers were wounded, and the cost of the war at US$36 billion was bleeding the U.S. treasury dry.<br><br>The American government was not going to waste any more American boys and money to end the war in a conventional but prolonged manner. It had never been their style.<br><br>Since Battle of Midway, the Japanese army had been suffering defeat and Tokyo had been bombarded beyond recognition, Germany and Italy had surrendered, but still Japan showed no sign of surrendering. The young kamikaze pilots kept coming.<br><br>Pressure in the American home front was mounting as more body bags came home. Something drastic had to be done.<br><br>To end the war as soon as possible was the prime concern. And Roosevelt commissioned the Manhattan Project not to race against the Soviets, but against the Nazis.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by dragg:<br>these arguments are going nowhere.  you may be right with all the facts but the main issue now is what the protest or boycott will achieve.</blockquote>Point noted. The facts were not presented to encourage people to protest or boycott. Whether to stop patronising Japanese restaurants or to boycott Japanese goods is a personal decision, and nobody has the right to force his or her opinions down the throats of others.<br><br>However, there seemed to be misguided notions about the motives behind the protests. Shouldn't people at least be entitled to get the facts right first before making disparaging remarks like "the Chinese eat full too free"?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ahyah, what's the point? There's nothing to be gained by boycotting. Japanese businesses invests somewhere else, people lose jobs and are then deprived of a greater variety of technology and goods. It's economic war, one that will benefit noone, except maybe US.<br><br>Also dun forget that because of America's late involvement in the war, they are the most 'undamaged' and thus able to continue their economic success. So, same for Singaporelah. We should profit from other countries problems. Try to maintain healthy relationships with everyone and remain as neutral as possible. So if Japan cannot access the Chinese market directly, who will they go to? If China does not want to rely on Japan's expertise, who will they turn to? It's the ever-sunny Singapore. So, yeah..long live Singapore.<br><br>Still, I believe Japan should be wacked. If Germany can do it, why can't they? But boycotting is not the way to go and now, is not the time.<br><br>Anyway, just like to add, that for me, the issue is not about what they did in the past but that they choose not to acknowledge it. As much harm as Japan did, they also did much good for Singapore. After our independence, they risked investing in a small island, provide us with jobs and shared their expertise. Furthermore, certain aspects of Singapore is based on the Japanese model. So, yeah, we must not forget that either.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>in fact japanese investments have helped more than just singapore.  many countries have benefitted from their post-war success.<br><br>1.  written off a lot of debts of 3rd world countries.<br>2.  financial help offered in time of disaster.<br>3.  loans and support of major projects in various regions.<br><br>the list just goes on and on...<br><br>whatever atrocities the japanese had committed in the past they have more than made up with all the above.  think of the number of people who has benefitted.<br><br>please stop comparing them to germany.<br><br>germany acknowledged their mistake but sustained no atomic bombs.<br>japan did not acknowledged their mistake but sustained 2 atomic bombs.<br><br></div>
