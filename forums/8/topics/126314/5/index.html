They could have at least encouraged the government to face up to truth and admit its wrongdoings, but what has been achieved even in this internet world?</blockquote>Yes, the Japanese people do have a part to play and they have indeed done something to their government -- they elected them.<br><br>Why does Koizumi insist on visiting the Yasukuni Shrine year after year? Not because he enjoyed annoying the Chinese or Koreans, but because it improved his approval rating within the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which happened to be the ruling party elected by the Japanese.<br><br>Of course, it is ridiculous to expect the people to elect the opposition just because of the Yasukuni visits. To their credit, the opposition parties have also voiced concern over Koizumi's disregard of Asian neighbour's feelings, but what is worrisome was the people's apparent endorsement of the LDP right-wing politics and foreign policies, which if left unchecked, would definitely lead to instability in the East Asian region in future.<br><br>Japan is not content to be an economic superpower. The country has enjoyed economic success and peaceful relations with their neighbours for so long that the government felt they deserved better and didn't care if they rocked the boat or not. A permanent seat in the U.N. Security Council is only the beginning.<br><br>Are the Japanese truly as apathetic as Singaporeans? Will they heed the call of their government should the dream of "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" rear its head again? Only time will tell.</div>

Perhaps in S'pore, we are rather sheltered, feel very protected.. but then, actually alot of things can shake the peace we have now..<br><br>Firstly, nuclear proliferation is a possible problem.. with countries like India and N. Korea... if more n more countries have nuclear power.. den the next war surely all of us say bye bye...<br><br>Also, how abt our earth? the rising oil prices already is a clear sign of how LIMITED our resources are... who knows, maybe the next war will be because of competition for resources... as most 1st world countries depend on other countries for their resources n markets for export...<br><br>Not to mention the terrorist problem.. no need to have war between nation states now.. these terrorists are very advanced n rich.. maybe they ownself got nuclear plant we dunno right... moreover, their cultures, religions are so different from the developed world's.. and these terrorists are desperate.. they will do anything to protect their disappearing cultures..<br><br>Ok.. if i were to list everything.. can list till tml... so just bear in mind we have alot to face now... lets try to work towards a better future for our children.. instead of fighting over whether to eat Jap food ok...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Perhaps in S'pore, we are rather sheltered, feel very protected.. but then, actually alot of things can shake the peace we have now..<br><br>Firstly, nuclear proliferation is a possible problem.. with countries like India and N. Korea... if more n more countries have nuclear power.. den the next war surely all of us say bye bye...<br><br>Also, how abt our earth? the rising oil prices already is a clear sign of how LIMITED our resources are... who knows, maybe the next war will be because of competition for resources... as most 1st world countries depend on other countries for their resources n markets for export...<br><br>Not to mention the terrorist problem.. no need to have war between nation states now.. these terrorists are very advanced n rich.. maybe they ownself got nuclear plant we dunno right... moreover, their cultures, religions are so different from the developed world's.. and these terrorists are desperate.. they will do anything to protect their disappearing cultures..<br><br>Ok.. if i were to list everything.. can list till tml... so just bear in mind we have alot to face now... lets try to work towards a better future for our children.. instead of fighting over whether to eat Jap food ok...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </div></blockquote>Well put sister.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well technically, if we were under jap rule we would be prospering under them, look at how well they are now, not to mention the girls they have (thats personal) but on the hand we might be treated as slaves.<br>but then if USA dint drp bombs on them, they wouldnt hv started to industrialize that quickly and work so hard to rebuilt, which in turn making them prosper. and if we were to be under their rule, we might be as poor as china (dunno if all these are any help hahahaha)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
