"<br>I am not digressing when I bring in the example of NATO and US. A trade embargo is an <span style="color: red;">official government level boycotting of another country.</span> Did the trade embargo on Iraq hurt the NATO and US economies or Iraq? Ans: It hurts Iraq a hell lot. As for the US and NATO, their economies weren't affected by the embargo.<br><span style="color: cyan;"><br>of course there is no denying the trade embargo hurt iraq badly.  but iraq is no japan.  iraq have hardly any trade with anybody.  the boycott we are seeing or talking about now is on a totally different scale as compared to those imposed on iraq.  thus it wont be as effective.</span><br><br>I hope you are not a SAF officer because such an officer is by definition, responsible for the military protection of Singapore. If you are a SAF officer and takes lightly about this current Japanese issue, I hope you are the odd one out.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">all singaporeans are responsible for the protection of singapore, not just an SAF officer.  even if i take it lightly you can be trust that SAF wont.  and i am definitely not the odd one out.  if you have read all the post carefully a lot of people share my opinion.  in case you dont know or have forgotten let me clarify ;<br><br>i agree that japan is wrong in not admitting their war mistakes.<br>i agree that china and korea have reasons to be angry.<br>i dont agree on the boycott or street protest because it will do more harm to the boycotting countries than japan.  'pen' protest is fine.<br>i am a singapore born chinese.<br>i want peace.</span><br><br>Using your language: US weapons are more advanced than China, yet they still got hit by 911. It just takes some miseducated and moderately financed people to hit US with 911. How about Japan? You said Japan has a deep pocket. Who is more technologically advanced? Japan or Al Qaida?<br><br><span style="color: green;">911 is a terrorist attack, it has nothing to do with technology. you cant compare japan to al qaida.  japanese are not religious fanatics.</span><br><br>You will never know if Japan will carried out similar Al Qaida operations. The best way to minimise the chance is to encourage proper education. </div></blockquote><span style="color: darkblue;">you are stretching the issue again.  why do japan want to carry out terrorist attack?</span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LOL. It's quite funny to read the squabbles bwt dragg and Cindyfeh, Poren and Tuatua.<br><br>Really, there's no point being irrational here. You want to boycott, fine, go ahead and do it urself. Nobody's stopping you. Do it within your own ability. Just dun let ur boycott affect me or any other person and we wont complain. In S'pore, we are a free country where we can choose to buy or not to buy something. Exercise your free will. Boycott if you want, you can see if others also want to boycott or not. Else pls dun impose ur beliefs on others. Really, the only kind of ppl whom I hate really and I think is the ultimate bane of the world are those who want to impose their own beliefs on others. Prominent examples are the Japs DURING WW2, the colonials and imperialists during the 18th and 19th century and of course our dear Al-Qaeda.<br><br>Second, really, there is no point holding a protest like those in China and Korea. A protest just wastes taxpayers money in setting up a police barricade as well as waste traffic commuter's time by causing jams. Besides, I would like to see you hold a protest in Singapore. If your protest lasts more than 3 hours, gimme ur address and I will send $10 over to you. The police will just snuff you out b4 u can even start the protest. A violent protest like those in China realy is not beneficial to any parties and do not serve any constructive purpose. They dmg stuffs, Japs ask for compensations, China hold even more demostrations... The vicious cycle just continues, multiplying in magnitude everytime.<br><br>The only rational thing to do is to gather signatures and just send letters to the Jap embassy, expressing your disatisfaction. No one is stopping you. You can even create a petition online and ask others to sign it. There are tons of other ways to express ur views than to go onto the demonstration route.<br><br>Dun mistake me as one who is pro-Jap, pro-"Superior cultures". In fact, I am also disatisfied with the distortion of Jap history books. There is always something called the international pressure. Besides, I dun fink that Japan warrants a permanent seat in the UNSC cos it's not really that impt in world politics.<br><br>I am Chinese and I disapprove of those atrocities that the Japs committed DURING WW2. Bickering over such a small issue among us will just make us the laughing stocks in others.<br><br>Also, I recommend that u read this writing by Hemingway called "Old Man at the Bridge". In it, you wil find that for the ordinary citizens like us, survival and economical well-being is much more impt than politics and ideologies. Your political beliefs ain't gonna feed you when you are hungry.<br><br>P.S. I think u better demolish ur house now as I believe some of the construction machines used to build your flat/condo/terrace/semi-d/bungalow is made in Japan. Also, even u only take the NEL, the LCDs screens at the stations are made in Japan. Besides, most of the Jap goods are made in 3rd-world countries like CHINA. So, think twice b4 boycotting. Will it have the desired effect?<br><br>WORLD PEACE AND ECONOMIC PROSPERITY!!!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

According to <a href="http://www.comfort-women.org/" rel="nofollow">www.comfort-women.org</a>, so far the Japanese government had never officially admitted to their war crime of forcing young Chinese and Korean women into sexual slavery to serve the military.<br><br>Several class action suits have been filed against Japan, but have been dismissed due to political reasons. The U.N. Commission on Human Rights has adopted many resolutions supporting the cause of "comfort women", yet all have been summarily brushed aside by the Japanese authorities, while the Commission has been encouraged by lobbyists, as in this forum, to divert focus on China's human rights records instead.<br><br>If there was indeed any payment made by the Japanese authorities to the "comfort women", it must have been conducted in a hush-hush off-the record manner for no official reparation from the Japanese government to the individual "comfort women" was ever documented. However, one would doubt the acceptance of such "hush money" by most "comfort women" for no money in the world would ever wash away the horror of the ordeal they have suffered under countless depraved Japanese men. It was justice they sought, not bribes.</div>
