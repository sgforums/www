(using economy to win the 'war'  since they failed militarily)  if china dont attack now they wont in the future.  imagine how affluent china will be decades later. will anyone want a war?  therefore economic war is the best way out.<br><br>another reason is because of taiwan.  taking back taiwan is china's top priority.<br></div></blockquote>It doesn't matter whether China is going to be the top economy and Japan going to be worst economy (anyway it won't).
