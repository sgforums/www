But you cannot force people not to support. From what you are trying to imply, is that you want to force everyone to stop using /consuming japanese products. Which is wrong.<br><br>Don't bring your freaking politics into the things we eat, the things we wear and the things we use. You want to scold somebody, you scold the jap gov. But if you want to turn against those who are not willing to support your idea. You can jolly well go and die.</div>

The chinese traitors during the Japanese occupation really died because they wanted to turn against those who were not willing to support their idea, which was "supporting the Japanese".</div>
