Isn't it a disgrace to the great Chinese culture and Nanjing and all the dead? Isn't it unpatriotic?</blockquote>It's not patroitic, but it's not un-patroitic as well. There are three reasons why people should be discouraged from attacking such establishments:<br><br>1. To put in a word of fairness, no one should deprive another of the right to make a living through legal means. If the restaurant owner must be blamed, so must the customers who patronise it share the blame as well. No demand, no supply.<br><br>2. Attacking such a restaurant only represents an attack against the culture. There is nothing wrong with the Japanese culture per se -- it is their way of life. What those people need to attack, however, is the lack of moral integrity the Japanese government has displayed while distorting history to hide their country's shame from the young.<br><br>3. Descending to barbaric levels of mindless violence achieves nothing productive, and only proves to sniggering detractors that the Chinese people are a vengeful, vindictive race no better than the Japanese who invaded them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by dragg:<br>so some of those who are very pro-china in this forum could be writing from china</blockquote>It is natural to expect a person to give opinions supporting his or her own country in cross-border issues. As to whether the opinion is objective or subjective, don't you think a discerning reader should question the opinion based on its own merits, rather than on which camp it comes from?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>da-mn, this topic is still alive!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br><strong>Cannot forget</strong><br>really good exchange going here  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  whatever it is, we cannot forget but we can forgive - given the right terms and conditions - that is. honestly, i dun really feel how our forefathers had felt during the 3yrs 08mths, can you? I can't. Think I have no right to denounce japs or anything relating to them.<br><br><strong>Evolution</strong><br>one thing leads to another, without the war, we also cant be sure singapore would be today. things may turn out differently. its like a social ecology. i dunno whether to say right or wrong, but twisting facts is certainly not moral - which the japs has been preaching abt - morality. but i dun read japanese and never seen or read the books, have you? i cannot be the judge if i havent, i cannot be the judge if i did feel the war, i cannot judge because i was not in the war.<br><br><strong>how to make peace?</strong><br>somehow, human, regardless of race or nationality, should start to learn to stop making excuses to creating unrest - this goes out to jap, mainlanders and us (and everyone else in the world).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br><strong>Are you dumping your jap stuffs?</strong><br>what i really like to know is: those who pro-mainlanders or anti-japanese, are they really bycotting jap stuffs now? i am not picking a fight but just rationalizing the situation. some of our trains are from jap isn't?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>If your home do have a sony, have u throw it away already? if u r planning to so, please let me know. i ll be there to take care of them for you  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><strong>Economic effect</strong><br>economically, i am against protesting especially when it concern economy. japanese products has spread its businesses all over the world and many developing countries has several japanese manufacturing plants which has provided livelihood for many - including china, sg, m'sia. i cannot imagine if the situation turn really rowdy and these were to close down. millions will loose their jobs almost at an instant. what good will that do?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  among all, proverty is the worst. the immediate future is our concern. history is for us to learn, and be wary that things may happen again but not for us to hub on and lament all they without any progress in our own lives.<br><br>i cannot imagine the days where we have to endure social unrest, lootings, riots etc. it will be darkest in our lives if inter-country politics cannot come to terms.<br><br><strong>Which brand of arrow?</strong><br>One day, a man was walking an open area when he was shot by an arrow in chest. out of nowhere. this man is breeding profusely and he would die if he dun hurry and seek help for his wound.<br><br>instead, he ponder (at the spot of the incident) who would want to kill him, is it by accident? is it a purpose attempt to take his life? Does the arrow contain poison? Where did the arrow originated from? what is the brand of the arrow etc etc... by the time this time, after the endless why, the man has already died of blood loss. so why freeze ourselves in time just to wonder what and why, shouldn't we be moving on and stop worrying about history?<br><br></div>
