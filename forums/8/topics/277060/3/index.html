Battery fully charged also like that. Nokia (Century Sq) said they'll do a software upgrade. 1 hr later they called me back and said they needed to send to HQ as the problem was more complicated. It could be the internal battery for clock n date was dead or something more serious. Told me it would take 4 days to a week or so.<br><br>After a week, they told me that something wrong with the motherboard, so they need to change a new one but no parts. need to wait for parts - will call me again.<br><br>Never happened. I waited over a month. Called them and they told me that the phone still at HQ and no parts. I asked them where is this HQ they said it's classified. I asked them to give me an estimated time of completion they said they don't know. probably parts arrive in a week or so.<br><br>I went down to Nokia Care(CS) and looked for the manager. He gave me the same stupid response. I told him I don't care. It's either he fix my phone immediately or walk over to his sales side and take a brand new N93 and give me or just use a new N93's motherboard and put it into mine. For the time my N93 sat in his HQ, the price depreciated and dropped by $100 cause they just launched N93i and I still have not seen my phone. He claimed that the nokia sales side is different from nokia care and he had no way to take a new phone. I then asked for a full refund of the phone then or the price at which I purchased it ($1,28<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> so I could walk over and buy a new one then since he "could not give me a new set". Surely he could give me the money to get a new set instead or he could loan me a temporary phone while I wait for mine to be repaired. He still insisted he could not do anything.<br><br>I also made it clear that I'm not trying to make a big fuss over a $0 phone that is 5 years old. I'm just trying to get back a $1,288 phone that is brand new. And for a phone that costs over $1,000 - is it that hard to expect some service at least?<br><br>He insisted that he is not in position to do anything and that the best he could do was to escalate the matter to the HQ of the HQ (like WTH?) and get back to me by the next day. I told him ok and waited.<br><br>The next day, to my extreme amazement, nokia care (Century Sq) called me back and said that my phone will be ready the next day for collection.<br><br>The next day, I went down to collect and lo and behold, the phone was REALLY ready for collection - after almost 2 months. And guess what? The manager took leave for the day and was not in when I tried to ask to see him again!<br><br>I don't see how "no parts" for over a month and 2 days ago he told me parts wont arrive for another week and suddenly overnight the phone was ready. Nokia really doesn't care. The whole thing is just stupid.<br><br>Oh and now the clock n calendar doesn't reset anymore but the phone keeps shutting off by itself or restarting and its intermittent.<br><br>Sometimes it jams and I can't send messages either.<br><br>Nokia sucks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Perhaps the only thing that is upsetting is the need to go to a nokia service center to update software....has that changed yet?<br><br>Other than that, my trusty nokia 6100 is now moving into its 5th year of operation with me....and i still keep it on 24h.

            <div class='col-md body'>I am using Nokia 6280 too.<br><br>I have been using Nokia since my first phone, you can call me a die-hard Nokia fan.<br><br>When I got the Nokia 6280, there were a lot of problems, like auto-restart when using MP3 Player, or no signals.<br><br>And I have to go to Woodlands Causeway Point just to repair my phone. Everytime when I got my phone back, the same old problem is still there.<br><br>Like the others, I was so frustrated I felt like complaining to whoever has the highest position in the company.<br><br>Then, they told me to wait for a new firmware version, and a kind personnel gave me their service center phone number, for me to call to check if a new firmware is available or not.<br><br>I did as told after a few weeks. They helped me update to a new firmware. This at least fixed the restarting problem.<br><br>Then, the Pop-Port (where you plug your earphones and cable) started to have problems. I brought it to the centre again.<br><br>When I got it back, it wasn't fixed at all. At that time I thought I was being made a fool.<br><br>Maybe I should consider myself lucky that the manager was there at that time. He tried to somehow fix the problem a little bit, and gave me the phone back. He promised me once the new motherboard parts have arrived, he would contact me.<br><br>Around 2 weeks later, I got his call. This time, my phone was fixed.<br><br>And from then until now, I don't have any problems with it anymore.<br><br>Oh, it will be my 6280's first anniversary soon. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by 105090:</div><div class="quote_body">the phone got what problem, Nokia automatically ask to "software upgrade" without even evaluating the problem  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> </div></blockquote>They evaluated the problem and fixed it in a new firmware version (so-called upgrade your software).</div>
