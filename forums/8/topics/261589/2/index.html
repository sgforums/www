Now, some of the teachers have decided to hang around the club frequented by the students from our school to catch them in the act and get them in trouble. I think this is totally unfair because what a student does outside of school is none of the school's business and they shouldn't interfere with students' private lives and this kind of 'spying' is a major breach of privacy. I know that engaging in activities such as clubbing, drinking and smoking at this age is against the law but that should be the parents' concern not the school's. Please post comments or thoughts on the matter thanks.</div></blockquote>too bad, would you rather the school to catch you and give you yet another boring long winded lecture or your parents to bail you out of jail with police record and possible expel from your school?<br><br>get you into trouble!? don't be an idiot, its more likely they were trying to protect your worthless arses.<br><br>fu<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>cking dumbass. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
