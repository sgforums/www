            <div class='col-md body'>Guys, seriously I suggest that this thread be closed. Its getting abit out of hand and certain statements are getting personal, and the point just keeps repeating over and again. So wads the point of continuing if he doesnt accept our views and insist persistenly on his stand, when he clearly stated please post your comments and thoughts.<br><br>If his intended outcome was to grab attention, then i say he succeded alright. If he intended to start a heated debate, he has also succeded. If he doesnt want to change, so be it.<br><br>I had posted before, but honestly TS, u are a foreign student ok. Please dont do anything stupid in foreign countries. The fact that you could come to Singapore to study meant that your family background is on the wealthier side, but when you get caught, yea maybe your parents can get you bailed out. But in the future no one is going to save your sorry ass when you step into a puddle of shit. Sorry for the vulgarities again.<br><br>Anyway, i think the forumers here are just trying to bring across the point that you are still young, there are many things you have not seen. They are many ugly facades of society that has till now only been obscured and hidden from you, and when you open these doors at such a young age, you might not be able to handle what lies behind. The forumers here are all mostly grown-ups, with years of life experience, we have been through the kind of pubescent rebelliousness you are currently facing. Some of us might even know your problem even better than you do. So please try to be all ears, and not so defensive. You are really really young now, as i have mentioned before, dont do stupid things.<br><br>In conclusion, I am appealing to the Mods to close this thread. Its seriously getting no where. And its pointless hurling abuses in this forum, it just exacerbates matters, and helps this thread and the TS gain unneccesary attention.<br><br></div>

Please read my first post; you are getting completely off topic. I'm not asking you guys if I should go clubbing or not I'm asking you whether teachers should have the right to investigate into such things out of school. If I wanted parental advice from you I'd ask for it so please don't get mad at me because I'm not listening to your advice it's because I didn't ask for it in the first place.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And btw, I don't mind you telling me not to go clubbing, that's fine but getting pissed off at me because I'm not listening to you is not.
