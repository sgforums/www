I'd suggest u try and understand those reasons a lil better, TS.. don't lash out at the adults who try and steer you away from it.. If u're doing somethin non-legit, u can't expect to pull your rights here.<br><br>All in all It's all fine and dandy if you just wanna have some teenage fun.. just be sensible, don't get hurt, and don't hurt anyone in the process.. some hurt doesn't show until much later in life, beware  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
