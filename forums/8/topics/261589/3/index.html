            <div class='col-md body'>Being a student myself in a Sec Sch, I know of a handful of girls who club, drinking there and smoking there as well. Though I'm  already 18, I've not stepped into any clubs, pubs yet as I'm not interested and because of it being smoking environment as I'm a non-smoker.<br><br>Seriously, TS should be glad that it's the teacher who's trying to find out those students who're in unlawful deeds rather than wait and not take actions until a police report is faxed to the school. The teacher may be concerned for the student and hence trying to counsel them first before they get into any trouble.<br><br>Whenever a student is caught committing unlawful acts, a police report will be submitted to the school. When it happens, the form teacher have to meet the HOD of Discipline to write a report. The VP, P will be notified and they've a report to submit to MOE and the District Principal. It's alot of paperwork for just a misdeed committed. Sometimes, the police might ask the school to give a testimony on the student's academy performances and behaviour in school if the offender is hauled to court. If the school is nice, they may attempt to save the offender by writing a nice testimony and getting the teacher to speak to the Police Officer in-charge. Or, they can simply follow the SOP and submit every single details of the offender to the police and offender will get lesser chances of being given another chance by the judge.<br><br>I know I sounds as if I'm condemming TS, but actually is to let TS know what's happening in school, between the MOE and SPF as well. Teenages like us may disobey certain instructions because we doesn't like to be controlled by adults. But sometimes, it's good to understand what happens behind the scene and try to put yourself in the adult's shoe.</div>

They are underaged and they (teachers) have the right to do so . Unless they are grown up adults and they spy on them , thats different . I have one teacher who cared for me alot , and im kinda touched by her actions .</div>
