Don't you have anything better to do? I certainly did not deem your opinion as unacceptable, just because I did not heed your advice you started being a b*tch. You know what I think? I think it's because you have no friends...either that or your mum didn't hug you enough when you were little. Either way you need help because you seem to enjoy "flaming happening kids like me" whatever the f*ck that means. Maybe if you went out with your friends more often (if you had any) you wouldn't be such a dickhead.</div>
