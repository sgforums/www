And yes I used the word majority again coz that's what I gather from my own knowledge. It's the same with everyone, everyone's opinion is derived from their personal knowledge or understanding of something, not from a whole bunch of graphs and statistics. And, unless you're part of the 15~16 year olds you wouldn't know as much about it as someone who is (me). So please stop being so assertive about your own ideas and disregarding my comments based upon my knowledge of things. I could even say the same thing about you; you don't have any evidence that the majority of teens DON'T smoke and/or drink.</div>
