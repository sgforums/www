              <p>frankly, the bank could have told her outright that she has
              proven herself to be a nuisance, and someone who is taking away
              resources used to serve the real customers of the bank, the other
              people.. as such, she cannot be treated as a customer.. but as
              someone who is detrimental to the rest of the real customers..</p>
              <p>and as such, they have been mistakened and will therefore
              reimburse her savings and whatever credit she had in the bank.. and
              she should take her custom to other banks...</p>
              <p>then give her a cheque for the outstanding amounts in her
              accounts, close them and request that she vacate their
              premises..</p>
              <p>they can then put her name into the banking systems, to warn
              other banks about her...</p>

              <p>Now that would be fun, especially since she openly declared too that she provided a fake address.</p>

              <p>anyway the manager may have attempted to explain the advertisement more (one argument could be tat they had ever given a cake one time in one branch under the advertised scenario and tat gives them the right to advertise such a way) but she just brush it off without listening</p>
