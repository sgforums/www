            <div class='col-md body'>The topic of cohabit struck me after reading nutx's topic on affair after marriage so anyone got any views on this topic?<br><br>I find that cohabit is a very good way of finding out whether yr present partner is yr ideal partner to spent yr entire life with.You get to know the ugly habits that are usually not shown while out in public or over a short period and u get to know whether can u live with those habits of yr partner.<br><br>Cohabit seems to be a very negative idea in the past cos its not very good for a gal to stay with a guy b4 they r formally married as its believed that the element of sexual activties is bound to be present and the female will be classified as a rather "sui bian" woman.(no offences to the ladies)<br><br>Its better to find out more abt yr partner b4 getting married right? I find that this mayb just be one of the best ways to find out.<br><br>If give the chance of cohabit,I'm in for it man!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Cohabit? hmm.. first of all, for practicality, where are we going to stay? At the rates of the houses and the way i spend, i'll be lucky if i manage to juz get myself past each month without seeing red!! Not a good idea to stay with either sets of parents cuz they might have veree set opinions abt us.<br><br>I dun see what is wrong with cohabiting although i dun see myself doing that in the near future.. Cohabiting is still a rather negative and taboo subject, well for me anyway cuz i think my parents might juz sit me down for some "a girl should ..." talk or sth, although they dun seem to mind the idea of couples taking holidays together.. i dun understand the older generation.<br><br>The bad thing abt cohabiting is that u get to see a lot of habits of the other person. Having to see ur partner's little quirks here and there, day after day, weeks after weeks, they might seem less "cute" as the months go by and instead become points of arguments.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sometimes you have to cohabit if you are studying overseas.<br><br>my fren's sister have to stay with 3 other guys during her studies in UK. But they have their own rooms of course. Actually there is a 4th guy, her bf, but he went back to Sg after graduation.<br><br>Nothing untoward happened. But her parents sure have a 90s mind. hehe<br><br>as for my case last time, my roommate and i travel alot during holidays and we stay at our frens' places. Some girls some guys.<br>And there was one time we had 1 girl 2 guys (us) in a room as her place is shared with other ppl so it is not very nice to sleep in the common area.<br><br>I mean, just have a clear conscience, if you had nothing to do with him/her. What's wrong with cohabiting? In the end, it's just between you and her regardless of what others say.</div>
