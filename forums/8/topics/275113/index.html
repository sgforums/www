            <div class='col-md body'>A very simple view, and here is the reason why. They sue people not because of privacy infringement, authenticity or royalty infringement, but because Odex wants to earn money, quick money. They want people to buy their products, the complete set of series of Inuyasha, and whatever else they licensed.<br><br><strong>What is Odex?</strong> It is a Singaporean company that licenses and releases anime for local and South East Asian consumption, formed in 1998. They are definitely trying to earn big bucks here by a marketing network. Of course they can't earn big bucks if everyone downloads Inuyasha, that is why this suing case. They even talk the Singapore court and ISP into charging $3000-$5000 per individual. This is hilarious.<br><br><strong>Why is it outrageous and unfair?</strong> <span style="color: red;">It merely sends out 17 warning letters to citizens, but wants to sue thousands.</span> It wants to silently ambush you. If you are reading this,<strong> here is what you all can do now. Don't buy from Odex company from now on.</strong> Let the court case continue, but don't buy anything licensed by Odex. You can buy from other <strong>honest</strong>, reasonable license companies. Let their sales rate be low, even empty. Let them go bankrupt in their sales market, even though they had sued you. <span style="color: red;">Let them learn a lesson not to be a silent money sucker by forcing the ISP to change their terms of services and infringe upon your privacy, giving away your identity!</span> We need to be smart now. And let us see the difference betweenus and the other countries, like Japan.<br><br><strong>Quoted</strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"It has been noted that Article 38 of Japan's copyright law allows parties to 'distribute by wire a work already broadcast for non-profit purposes'. - Andy Ho, Straits Times 16th August 2007"<br><br>"(Performance, etc. not for profit-making)<br>Article 38<br><br>(2) It shall be permissible to diffuse by wire a work already broadcast, for non-profit-making purposes and without charging any fees to audience or spectators.<br>(3) It shall be permissible to communicate publicly, by means of a receiving apparatus, a work already broadcast or diffused by wire, for non-profit-making purposes and without charging any fees to audience or spectators. The same shall apply to such public communication made by means of a receiving apparatus of a kind commonly used in private homes"<br><br>The above two Sections of Article 38 places reasonable and fair doubt on ODEX's affidavit and claim to act on TV Tokyo's behalf, until the latter has expressively stated that it has authorised ODEX in a publicly accessible or notarised document, served notice in either Japanese or Singaporean press or any publicly available channel of communication, or accessible through a document request filed in a Japanese court (may or may not be under the Government Organizations Information Disclosure Law. I do not know if TV Tokyo is a state-owned enterprise of Japan); that ODEX may take legal action for TV Tokyo in Singapore for any perceived breach of copyright."</span><br><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=274429" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=274429</a><br><br>Though I myself had never downloaded licensed Odex anime, I strongly think we should do something; by not supporting Odex or buy any of their products. They literally thinks that by suing you, every citizens will feel scared and thus buy from their miserable 'cheap', 'discounted' VCDs and DVDs just for a complete set of Inuyasha.</div>
