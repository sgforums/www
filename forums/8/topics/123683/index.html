            <div class='col-md body'>We convince ourselves that  life will be better after we get married, have a baby, then another.  Then we are frustrated that the kids aren't old enough and we'll be  more content when they are. After that, we're frustrated that we  have teenagers to deal with. We will certainly be happy when they  are out of that stage.Â <br><br>We tell ourselves that our life will be complete when our spouse  gets his or her act together, when we get a nicer car, are able to  go on a nice vacation, when we retire.Â <br><br>The truth is, there's no better time to be happy than right now. If  not now, when?Â <br><br>Your life will always be filled with challenges. It's best to admit  this to yourself and decide to be happy anyway.Â <br><br>One of my favorite quotes comes from Alfred D. Souza. He said,  "For a long time it had seemed to me that life was about to  begin - real life. But there was always some obstacle in the way,  something to be gotten through first, some unfinished business, time  still to be served, or a debt to be paid. Then life would begin. At last it dawned on me that these obstacles were my life."Â <br><br>This perspective has helped me to see that there is no way to  happiness. Happiness is the way.Â <br><br>So, treasure every moment  that you have and treasure it more because you shared it with  someone special, special enough to spend your time...and remember  that time waits for no one.Â <br><br>So, stop waiting until you finish school, until you go back to  school, until you lose ten pounds, until you gain ten pounds, until  you have kids, until your kids leave the house, until you start  work, until you retire, until you get married, until you get  divorced, until Friday night, until Sunday morning, until you get a  new car or home, until your car or home is paid off, until spring,  until summer,Â  until fall, until winter, until you are off welfare, until the first or fifteenth, until your song comes on,  until you've had a drink, until you've sobered up, until you die,  until you are born again to decide that there is no better time than  right now to be happy.Â <br><br>Happiness is a journey, not a destination. Work like you don't need  money, Love like you've never been hurt, And dance like no one's  watching.Â <br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Look back on your life and reflect on the number of times  you said to yourself or to others that you "would be happy if you had  this, or that, or would be happy if this happened, or that happened".<br><br>Examples could be, you are supposed to be happy when you  earn a higher salary, or when you buy a new car, or when your health improves,  or when you finally find your life partner, the list goes on.<br><br>Now, did those things, assuming they really did happen,  really make you happier? If yes, how much, and for how long?<br><br>Chances are, many times, the happiness faded after some  time, you began to take those things for granted, and you started to search  for something new to make you happy.<br><br>The problem is, this could go on for your whole life, and  you will never really be happy, because there are just too many things to  attain in this world.<br><br>Perhaps, by being content with and appreciative of what you  have right now, you would be a lot happier with life.<br><br>Contentment doesn't necessarily have to compromise ambition  and the desire to improve. You can still seek to better your life. But if you  become too obsessed with it, you could find yourself running around in  circles, losing touch with the present and forgetting to be happy.<br><br>Sometimes, the source of happiness could just be  contentment.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I don't think anyone is really contented with what they have/are doing right now. Man is greedy, and it's a fact.<br><br>Nobody would "complain" that $$ is always so enough, work is too little, blah blah blah. If you ask me, $$ is never enough, and work is always piling up like mountains.<br><br>As people often say "the contented are always happy", it's true.
