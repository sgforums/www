            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys, it's been a while since i've posted here. Well, I just wanna throw a few questions regarding studying foreign languages for a better career prospect, Japanese in particular. What do you think of learning Japanese in Singapore? Does it give you an edge in finding a job (Japan-affiliated) and is it really the best choice if you had to learn a new language? More importantly, does knowing Japanese open up opportunites of overseas employment and such?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I had a choice to study a foreign language, I took it and never regretted it.  I found language classes a lot more interesting than my core modules in school. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Passion is of the utmost importance I feel. I thoroughly enjoyed the learning experience. Besides, it's not easy picking up a whole new language, so interests again is very important!<br><br>Japanese is probably one of the more popular foreign languages here in Singapore. So generally speaking, it's won't be too difficult finding resources.<br><br>Whether or not it gives you an edge in finding a job, logically speaking it depends on the type of job. The biggest misconcept is that Japanese companies based in Singapore will give the edge to candidates who speak their language. That's not true. Cos simply, you don't need to know japanese to work in Singapore! Unless you're talking about a job based abroad, knowing the foreign language will certainly give you the edge over others who don't!<br><br>As for the best choice of language, I guess it depends on where your interests lie and if you really want to make use of the added knowledge in your career path.  I opted for Spanish. It was purely for interests. I wasn't going to use it to apply for a company based in South America.<br><br>Lastly, I feel that in the long run, it could give you more career alternatives abroad, in your case Japan. But again, it only gives you the extra edge only if you have the basic qualifications and experience. From what I know, very few companies employ local fresh graduates or newbies for overseas assignments straight up.<br><br>All in my humble opinion. Hope it helps! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
