            <div class='col-md body'>Hey everybody , do u wonder why Jpop is getting hotter and hotter here in Singapore ? Ever since the japanese series under the same roof 2 , all the music shops have import a large amount of jpop Cds and put them up on sale . Last time , we only heard of Change and Aska and we tought they are the best group but now , there are X-Japan , Luna Sea , Speed , Max , Ayumi Hamasaki , Aikawa Nanase , ELC , Utada Hikaru , Namie Amuro and a new group Do as Infinity etc .......   . I have buy a couple of jpop Cds lately 'cause the music is totally diffrent from chinese , english , cantanses pop and the way they sing is very fresh and i'll feel relax even though i dun understand a single word . Another factor is their looks , singer like Ayumi and Namie are babes and i am sure u will agree with me that their looks play an important part in the sales of their album . I sure hope that jpop will add a whole new taste of music into Singaporeans and hope that more of us will learn to appreciate their music . JPOP ALL THE WAY !! :-)___</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>J-Rock is also becoming very popular in Singapore. I would prefer J-Rock to J-Pop, but each has his/her favourite. My favourite are Dir en Grey, Luna Sea, Laputa and Aliene Ma'riage. These bands are really visual as from their dressing. As for J-Pop, they are not really very much into their dress code on stage or in MTV. However, I like Ayumi Hamasaki for her looks, and I seldom listen to her songs. My conclusion is that, Japanese songs will become a big hit in Singapore in the next few years, be it J-Rock or J-Pop.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Phew! After some long search through the forum i finally found something being said about Jpop! I am into Jpop! No particular faves but erm i think Do As Infinity is good! Let's not forget 'The Brilliant Green' (theme song of 'Overtime') and my all time fave is 'Cagnet'.(responsible for the soundtrack of Long Vacation and Love Generation)<br><br>I have watched quite a few jap shows. And most of them didn't disappoint me. What's the latest u people have watched? Any comments? Oh, did anyone watch Japan Hour feature on XJapan lead singer Hyde? Very touching episode. I learnt more about the group, the lead singer, the songs and why Japanese teenagers are so into the group.<br><br>Am quite a fan of Jap things..hehe hope i am not going overboard here. Like to hear from you people though  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> This is all i have to say for the moment.</div>

Is SPEED sexy? No... and I like SPEED cos of their dancing and song. Have u ever seen Speed's concert? They have good dance cordination. Now, if ppl buy their album becos they're pretty, you should open your eyes wide. Even a 10 yrs old girl is their fan. And she can sing along with them. But you can say what you like.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Speed (edited 24 April 2000).]</div>
