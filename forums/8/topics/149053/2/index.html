            <div class='col-md body'>Indians should all be very proud of India! Do you know that India is the<br>richest country in the world? Right now India is the richest country in the world !<br><br>Ask how? Really amazing. It is due to Mr. G Vaidyaraj who donated all his<br>wealth,about which he too was not knowing He is a descendent of Raja<br>Krishnadev Roy from Mysore district.<br><br>&gt;From last 300 years or so three stones were worshiped in his house, but no<br>body tried to see what it was,except this person who is a lawyer by<br>profession. Oneday, incidentally, when there was nobody in his house,<br>he took the stone Out to see what it is that we worship.<br><br>Due the dust deposited on it from years It looked like a simple stone only,<br>but when he touched it some portion of the stone Was cleansed, and he saw a<br>bright ray of light. He saw some thing which attracted his Attention and he was amazed when he<br>cleaned all of them. The whole room was filled With light. He discovered the<br>diamonds of about 4600 carats each. He informed the Govt. of India And the<br>news is censored with its security.It is now deposited in Swiss bank.<br>The cost of single diamond exceeds the GDP of USA + UK, India can buy<br>virtually 7 developing nations. Even World Bank does not have enough money<br>to buy it. One diamond costs thrice the debt of World Bank over India.<br><br>One such diamond can buy 10 Bill Gates to you and World Bank has proposed<br>the Indian Govt. that it can pay India in Installment if it wishes to do so.<br>India's GDP is 34.25 billion dollars and Bill Gates property is 95 billion<br>dollars approximate so that is the way "nature changes".<br>Mr.Vajpayee has refused to sell it. He said it will be sold or mortgaged for<br>credit when we need it. Otherwise right now we have no problems.<br><br>You can go through Times of India with a small column on it a week ago. Star<br>TV presented a 115 min documentary on it about 15 days ago. The Hindu with<br>its half page article in it. After that it was censored classified.<br><br>Another good news is that the Desert of Thar a deposit of Oil and Natural<br>gas has been found, which stores what Kuwait has in its stomach. India can<br>go with this ONGC energy reserve with another 30 years and more over it can<br>export it to other counties. It's incredible!! But true.<br><br>An Indian boy in his 12th standard has disproved Einstein's Theory<br>of Relativity<br><br>Shocked? Read on...<br><br>Sudarshan Reddy has theoretically proven the existence of a sub-atomic<br>particle, which can travel at speed greater than that of light, thereby challenging one of the fundamental postulates of the Theory of Relativity.<br>In his recent research paper submitted to the Institute of Advanced Physics<br>(IAP) at Trieste (Italy), Sudarshan has proved the existence of a class of sub-atomic particles called "leptons"which can travel faster than light.<br><br>The international physics community is shocked by this discovery.<br><br>Dr.Massimo Martelli, President of the IAP has this to say about the paper<br>submitted by Sudarshan. After long, careful and critical analysis, I can<br>confidently say that Sudarshan's research papers show tremendous leap in<br>our understanding of physics. His investigation mounts up on leptons.<br><br>His work builds substantially on the work of Einstein and others in the<br>field of relativity.<br><br>When physicists from Princeton University tried to measure Sudarshan's IQ<br>with an IQ-meter (at the American Embassy in Delhi), the meter broke down.<br>Sudarshan, incidentally, is the brother of Madhu Reddy, the Indian whiz<br>kid who developed an operating system superior to Microsoft Windows.<br><br>We should all be very proud of these boys. Please forward this email to as<br>many Indians as you can.<br><br>Regards<br>A person who is proud to be Indian<br>Jai Hind<br><br>What a joke!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My dear Jagjit,<br>I am in a well here and hoping you are also in a well there. I'm writing this letter slowly, because I know you cannot read fast. We don't live where we did when you left home. Your dad read in the newspaper that most accidents happen 20 miles from home, so we moved 20 miles.<br><br>I won't be able to send the address as the last Sardar who stayed here took the house numbers with them for their new house so they would not have to change their address. Hopefully by next week we will be able to take our earlier address plate here, and that our address will remain same too.<br><br>This place is really nice. It even has a washing machine, situated right above the toilet I'm not sure it works too well. Last week I put in 3 shirts, pulled the chain and haven't seen them since.<br><br>The weather here isn't too bad. It rained only twice last week. The First time it rained for 3 days and second time for 4 days.<br><br>The coat you wanted me to send you, your Aunt said it would be a little too heavy to send in the mail with all the metal buttons, so we cut them off and put them in the pocket.<br><br>Your father has another job. He has 500 men under him. He is cutting the grass at the cemetery.<br><br>By the way I took Bahu to our club's poolside. The manager is Badmash. He told her that two piece swimming suit is not allowed in his club. We were confused as to which piece should we remove?<br><br>Your sister had a baby this morning. I haven't found out whether it is a girl or a boy, so I don't know whether you are an Aunt or Uncle.<br><br>Your uncle, Jetinder fell in the nearby well. Some men tried to pull him out, but he fought them off bravely and drowned. We cremated him and he burned for three days.<br><br>Your best friend, Balwinder, is no more. He died trying to fulfill his father's last wishes. His father had wished to be buried in the sea after he died. And your friend died while in the process of digging a grave for his father.<br><br>There isn't much more news this time. Nothing much has happened.<br><br>Love - Mom.<br><br>P.S. Jagjit, I was going to send you some money but by the time I realized, I had already sealed off this letter.<br><br>Another joke!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
