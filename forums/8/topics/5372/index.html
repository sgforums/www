            <div class='col-md body'>I'm now serving my NS and just yesterday, i met up with my friends from my x-secondary school. So...we were discussing the bad experiences with the policeman here in Singapore.<br>One of my friend even was slapped by one of the officers when he was confronted for being suspect to consume ecstasy(yes...his face looks like one). After some answering and questioning, the officers just went off without saying anything. So is this justified???<br>Another incident was that the police officer was in plain clothes and my friend was then just admiring the girl beside him, and the officer just come up to him and show him the warrant card. Is this what the police do as a form of their duties or are they too LOBO to do anything else.<br>Finally, i brought of the matter of policeman being a license ah-beng. All agree and don't you too. This mail had no intention of abusing the government and I should say there is good policeman around, rite?!?!? I just hope to get some feedback if anyone had gone through any bad experiences with the police and yes, some comments please on my post.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I know exactly what you guys mean. I think these people are just damn bored and/or damn stupid. You know what i think you should do? Write to the head of police/commisioner whatever u call the guy up there. Tell him you're a foreigner visiting and you have had this "unpleasant encounter" with some local policemen, and shit like that. Cos frankly I'm sick and tired of these people acting like they own the freaking country.<br><br>My friends have had experiences where they were made to squat and partially stripped cos they were "suspected" of god-knows-what. What kinda crap is that? they've got no proof, and they're basically out to abuse their "power". I'm not saying all policemen are like that, most are really nice and helpful, but there is this minority who insist on having their little cheap thrills, and undermine our dignity in th process. If this is what they call "protecting our nation" then I'd rather they not.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well such a controversial topic. And we all thought that the Singapore Police was the most honest bunch of coppers ard. Where is "ME" and his comments..hee.<br><br>Well what you guys experiece is normal. Like I staed earlier to "ME" most of our police force consist of NSF and this is the only time of their life that they feel they have power so like all "rational" human being when with power - abuse.<br><br>If Singaporeans were not so controlled by fear of authority the police will not dare to abuse this power. I guess things will not change till some one stand up against them and the rest would follow and not be so afraid. But till that day come only the  strong will survive.

So if you feel that you've been threatened/bullied by Police Officers (Plain/Uniformed), take note of the EXACT TIME, DATE and EVENT OCCURANCE.

            <div class='col-md body'>firewire,<br>All my experiences with the police in this country have been very positive. They always shake hands, smile, and treat you like their pal. However, my interactions with them have always been on little matters, and there was probably little perceived threat. Maybe your situation in the dead of the night was different.<br><br>Anyways, from the looks of it, the guys who mess around are probably just NS boys. There was even one case where an NS police officer led this 15 yr old girl to a deserted HDB stairwell and forced her to let him suck on her breasts...to test for drugs. You really shouldn't have to fear getting deported because deporting someone isn't simply a matter of filling up a form at a police station. This is Singapore, not some third world country.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't have personal experiences with abusive policemen who throw their weights around and act like big shots in S'pore. However, I found some very inefficient and arrogant ones at a certain police post this year. My family was reporting a car break-in then. Just a minor case and it took them a few blardee hours just to type the report-that policeman typing it looked like he's never touched a typewriter in his life. And the most intolerable thing was, my mum actually got scolded by a more senior officer for not signalling to the police car when they arrived at the scene. What the heck. Even if we genuinely impeded their job, couldn't he have at least been more polite? My mum wasn't his blardee criminal for hell's sakes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi firewire and GTR,<br>Man, when i hear of these stories, really makes me mad, i maen there are like 10,000 other policemen working their butts off, then these clowns go and ruin the image....<br><br>i think my first assumption is that the girls involved must be quite chio.... it's like some cheap thrill for these (prob NS guys)...<br><br>best way to report it is to write in to the Permanent Secretary or Minister of Home Affairs, they take a damn serious view of these things.... yah, i know those jokers would cover each other up, but the internal investigations is going to put some real stress on them... like i said before, once mebbe can cover, but if somebody else reports the same clown, don't think the police force would look to kindly to that guy....<br><br>if wanna cause more headaches even after get reply that nothing was amiss.... attach letter to Prime Minister's office, believe me people do that.... just asserting your rights...<br><br>well, on our parts, try not to be smartalec or funnie with the police.... that's the kind of people we hate most and will life miserable for them....  techincally the laws are structured quite broadly in terms of how far the police can go.... for example, we are allowed to detain anybody for 48 hrs without reason....(this can really make life shitty for some people)....<br><br>Seperate note, policemen, if they detain girls will get into serious trouble if there wasn't a woman police person around.... this is taken very seriously....<br><br>not sure if all this helps, it was quite some time ago....<br><br>cheers,</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tnakx for the info Me...It's really good to kno that there are very strict safegaurds against this kind of thing...At least we know that there is an avenue of protection when thos times arise as some people will just do what they want...can't control them all..:-(<br><br>Why is it usually NS guys...is it because it is just a 1 1/ year thing for them?  No passion or not serious about the job? Quite curious.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey firewire,<br>why NS? actually i think some really take it seriously that i'm amazed given like what you said, we don't really have to give a damn....<br><br>for those who don't, well these guys are like about 19, most of them looking out for chio bu....<br><br>i've gone on tours with the regulars and they are usually no nonsense about these things, eg would never chat up a girl when they're in unifrom.... i guess they recignise that they have a lot to lose.....<br><br>NS.... if not going to uni or anything, not that much to lose.... if going uni, these demerit records can affect your entire career...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>guys...i've been waiting quite a long time for some replies. I thought nobody would dare to voice out, anyway thanks.<br>I see that quite a number of you support to lodge a complain against misdoings of bad behaving officers. Okay then, tell u what i learn from one officer when he told me about complaining. He told me that when you want to complain, sure go ahead! The most the officer will be defaulted(something like that), but then within the five years(NS liability), the officer will try his very hard to dig you out again and after the five years, the officer resigns and look for better prospects. Thus, so WHAT!?!? about defaulting.<br>About CPIB, the NPP officer informed that it only investigate matter concerning MONEY. So can anybody tell me how can we really tackle this category of officers on the road.<br>I read through about your experiences and it is so maddening to hear that some of you also met up with this kind of officers. I agreed on Rinoa. If you didn't do anything wrong, why scared of them!!!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>onnap,<br>yup, CPIB is offences regarding $$$,<br>but there is a section in the police force, i think it's IIS (Prob have changed by now) which looks at conduct of police officers, all complaints get directed there....<br><br></div>
