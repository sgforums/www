            <div class='col-md body'>Its great to receive the news that our beloved PM Lee has come out with a $2.6b help package for all Singaporeans. Although nothing is given out to the people when they needed it most during the 2003 SARS recession, it is just sheer coincidence that it is being given out now before the elections. As usual, Oppositions accuse PAP of vote-buying which is not.<br><br>Our PM, has explained that the budget is for the long term not short term. I guess the PAP has done a thorough job to think through this budget, they did nothing much since the Asian crisis occurred and people lost their jobs in big numbers - now 8 years later, our highly efficient PAP govt thinks there is an urgent need to help Singaporeans. Singaporeans are so lucky to have a govt that thinks long term and does not practise pork barrel politics.<br><br>The people of Potong Pasir are about to get lucky. First the people of Potong Pasir get $1 shark fin soup from Sitoh. Then he offers them a 10 year facelift plan and planned a mega-tour to Port Dickson. They are given a real democratic choice. If they vote for PAP's man Sitoh, their luck will change and the national upgrading programme will land in Potong Pasir and they will get their lifts upgraded.<br><br>Of course, the PAP is not so despicable to hold old folks hostage and force them to take the stairs just to get their votes. It is all a matter of luck. The PAP together &amp; Sitoh are not hypocrites - they are men of high principles and integrity. They truly care about the Potong Pasir people and just want to improve their luck when it comes to upgrading.<br><br>These lifts have become an election issue to the people of Potong Pasir.<br><br>It will be fantastic if PAP throw in a lucky draw after the elections with the type of prizes like XBox, computers and cars. The polling box containing the votes will be used for the draw. The vote which is the lucky draw ticket is valid only if you vote for the PAP. They can use the serial number to find you when you win the prize. That will really spice up the elections and make Singaporeans even happier. Goodie Bag + Lucky Draw.<br><br>Yes the good news just goes on and on for Singaporeans.. The good news will dry up after the elections like the last time and if fee hikes suddenly, I guess it is only unavoidable. We just got to wait for the next election.</div>

To keep the promise, we might cause more harm than good to . Even the people would not want us to keep the promise.

            <div class='col-md body'>PAP can't fool Singaporeans for long. 2006 is not the same as 2001 when citizen's interest in net postings, bloggings and political happenings are not as strong.<br><br>Citizens are now more knowledgeable, well-travelled and matured. PAP will still win this election no doubt. However, PAP's stubborn refusal to know the hearts, minds, emotions and needs of the people are doing them in instead.<br><br>For a long time, I have always thought that perhaps PAP might rule Singapore for 1000 years, LOL.<br><br>However, Singapore is a country exposed to international trade and news. Fortunately for us and unfortunately for PAP, Singapore is not like North Korea or Myanmar whereby there is a media blackout.<br><br>PAP's candidates are capable, professional and highly qualified no doubt, but eventually the public will start to reject the fact that insisting on this path to a one party rule and getting entrenched into their party policies will not be beneficial in the long run, just like in any business environment.<br><br>In business, we talk about listening to the Customer's Voice before the company can continue to compete and growth effectively.<br><br>PAP is essentially practicing double standards here, urging more competition in the business community with legislations while trying to have monopoly over the whole country. This contradiction will eventually erode their standing in the citizen's minds in the long run.<br><br>PAP's execution will be perfect if either they rule a communist country whereby citizens see no evil, hear no evil therefore unable to judge what is right or wrong; or if they rule like a monarchy over a rich country with natural resources like Saudi Arabia or Brunei for instance and citizens are well taken care of.<br><br>Plainly, the majority of Singaporeans have been suffering for a long time of being overworked, in heavy debts, in constant worry and having unstable jobs with dwindling salaries besides many 'No Thanks' to PAP on their FT policies, social and cultural oppression resulting in bad social grace and a horrendous service culture that makes living in this country like a walking zombie or the undead.<br><br>This Garden city, full of tall sky scrapers, clean air, clean water , high security and  great infrastructures will not be able to sustain inducing the citizen's hearts into submission for long, when they are clearly suffering as a result of the major flaws of the ruling party.<br><br>If PAP continues to behave this way, in the midst of increasing information available through the internet and technology, their days are practically numbered -  Eventually, this volcano will erupt. Looking at the ways events are unfolding, the most PAP can get is another 30 years or so, and off they will plunge into mediocrity.<br><br></div>
