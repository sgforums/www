            <div class='col-md body'>This one's a thoughie, well the main reason (IMHO) why females hate males visiting porn sites or indulging in any form of pornography is that it trivalises the female sex to sex objects. An image in which the female species has long fought against. Or worse, it trivialises the relationship.<br><br>And for that very same reason that males at times prefer to treat females as sex objects, do they indulge in it.<br><br>It is by no means healthy. But most of the time guys just let their hormones do the talking.<br><br>Thats why males prefer sex to be uncomplicated (mostly for enjoyment).....while females use sex as a sealing bond of a relationship. I guess thats why even married males indulge in the "M word". Though its solo, its uncomplicated (think i read this from a old issue of HER WORLD)<br><br>Males will be males.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There is nothing wrong with visiting porn sites really. And I think it's wrong for a girl to prohibit her boyfriend from visiting such sites.<br><br>Maybe you can argue about how such sites are morally wrong, but the act of visiting such sites out of curiousity is pretty alright.<br><br>In fact, I admit that I do visit such sites occassionally, to get a good laugh really. It's really interesting to see what stupid and disgusting things people are willing to do for money.<br><br>Secondly, I do not look at it as exploitation of women. The girls did it out of their own free will, (barring the exceptional cases). Exploitation exist everywhere, just that we choose to place more emphasis on certain types of exploitations only.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I find that porn is fine.  People should take advantage of it as a tool for learning...oh so that's what it looks like,...oh, so that's how it's done...etc, etc....<br><br>I've been lucky, All my x and present GF doesn't mind.  In fact, most of them watch with me...and boy do we explode later...I mean everywhere...literally.:-)<br><br>My present GF doesn't mind.  She always scolds me when she calls my house and can't get thru cause I'm connected to the net.  When she can't get thru, she knows where I'm surfing to.  ha ha.  But the scolding is for the fact that she has to call my handfone (costs too much money).  She'd rather i ogle girls onscreen than to ogle them in real life...Although she knows that I do go out and ogle them anyway when she's not around, but hse's ok with it because I've given her no reason to distrust me.  I'm lucky in that sense. unlucky in others...I won't say just in case she shows up here somehow...:-)<br><br>I mean, people do really demeaning and degrading things all the time for others who want to exploit them.  Porn is just the esiest, most noticable thing around for us to criticize.<br><br>The whole thing about it being demeaning to women and all that is something that's been fed to us by feminist propoganda from the sixties and seventies.  Then again, even though they were saying all this, these self-same people were going around throwing mass orgies and blow-job parties...no joke man...I come from San Fran, birthplace of feminisim, gay rights, and hippies.  I should know.<br><br>It is feminist propoganda.  I've always believed that a person should always make up his/ her own mind about something regardless of what people say about it.  ARe we going to make up our own minds or fall back on th e much easier idea that people came up with before us.<br><br>Basically it's up to the individual to make up their own mind.<br><br>Pink Fudge,<br><br>To answer ur question, I think that it is wrong for u to make such a demand and quite wrong of him to make similar demands of u.  Unless ur both agreeable to such terms /ways of life, then it will be a major point of conflict later on in the relationship...if not outwardly so, there will be a lot of resentment.  It's not fair really because ur asking him to deny his feelings.  It's like asking him to give up all his friends for u and vice versa.  Maybe he will, or u will, but it's still not right.<br><br>My GF doesn't allow me to look up if there's a pretty girl around.  Even if I'm not even looking in that girls direction, she will get angry.  Boy talk about unfair...But usually I don't pay much attention to these kinds of requests, because I think they are more silly than anything else.<br><br>U should trust ur boyfriend a bit more...trust me, it's not the women that he's getting turned on by, it's the whole act that he's seeing.  Most guys I'm sure aren't really turned on much by these silkicon implanted 38, 24, 38 porn chicks.  I mean, let him watch it, and then see what happens when he hits the sack with u afterwards...u will be rewarded...if that's ur cup of tea that is.  But I'm just assuming that.<br><br>Sorry...<br><br>But consider it, for the sake of his mental health.<br><br>Ps-He's probably looking anyway, behind ur back...believe me.  It's just that he feels he needs ur approval and probably feels guilty for something he feels he shouldn't be feeling guilty about in the first place.<br><br>happy porning.</div>

Imagine which guy/girl would want you if you created that kind of image for yourself ? Enough said...<br><br>I agree people do demeaning things around us too....but that is their own private business! They can go suck each other asses out for all I care, just don't let me SEE it...The subject of porn is that it's acts of sick people being displayed for all the world to see ! It harms children, distorts our perception of reality and ultimately would degrade the quality of life for our society !!<br><br>It should never be tolerated in the first place, and my stand is VERY strong on this one ! I will not attack Firewire directly because he is entitled to his own views, and this is a forum, but I certainly am totally opposed to them...<br><br>It's true that USA is probably the place where mass orgies and blow-job parties are common, but does this justify their existence ? I am NOT a Christian by the way but the acts themselves speak of a very troubled mind. It's basically all about lust.....and the more we feed it the more it grows and grows....it's like a heroin addiction and probably worse because it's psychological !!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>I wouldn't want a gf to tell me: "honey it's ok to visit porn sites, you're a guy and I understand you have desires too".....it'll be like she allows voyeurism for who knows what reasons ? I am perfectly capable of loving her without the influence of porn or other material.<br><br>Some might say I lose out in this arguement because I was NEVER attached before.....but take it from me that I would sincerely hope for a clean gf who cannot tolerate her bf visiting such sites. guess it's personal choice isn't it ?<br><br>By the way...cheers anyhow...I seldom get so worked up over something...<br><br>Come to think of it.....to even provoke me to such a reaction is uncommon  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Hahaha.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Dear Musicwhiz,<br><br>While I do not condone the porn sites, neither do I condemn them. Some of the pictures may be gross and not suitable for children, okay okay, maybe some is an understatement, but nonetheless, pornography is very much part of society. Whether you like it or not, it has integrated itself into society today, interwoven with the lifes of many. Pornography doesn't really create lust or produce perverts, if it did almost every man on earth would have been charged with rape, indecent behaviour, molest or some other sexual offences.<br><br>Singapore does it's best to ban porn sites, but the truth is, they are in abundance, and the simple law of economics will tell you that whenever there's a supply, there's a demand. We cannot eradicate it, but we can learn to live with it. In fact, I believe that porn sites can be used as a form of reverse psychology. It did put you off didn't it?<br><br>The gist of it all is that porn sites by themselves do no harm. Only when it is mixed with a person already corrupted by perverted thoughts would it form a cocktail of sexual crimes and offences. I dare say I visited those sites quite often, but I'm pretty much still normal and do not cast lustful eyes on every girl that walks past and habour evil intentions. Neither did I become a psycho who masturbates himself day in day out.<br><br>Don't put all the blame on pornography. It's never really it's fault in entirety.</div>

This is one controvesy that will not die...and Musicwhiz, I can respect ur strong headed stance on this.  At least u believe what u say and not something that's been fed to u by someone else...or else u wouldn't have such a strong feeling for the issue. :-)<br><br>AS for porn again, whether it is on the net or not, even in singapore u could get it.  I rember in 1992, Singapore had the very basic text internet, so no pictures yet...But Porn was still around.  for a place that's anti-porn it still is quite a thing here.<br><br>I hope that u don't hold it against people who do patronize such sites...because, like enigma said, it doesn't change what we already are whether we visit it or not.<br><br>ok...whiz, put...the...knife...down...slowly...slowly...<br><br>:-)<br><br>JK  cheers man.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess the question here is "Why do you NOT want your BF to watch porn???"<br><br>I think if it is due to the fact that you are concerned about him and you THINK that porn is going to be unhealthy for him then its good coz you are doing it outta concern for him.<br><br>But if its due to the fact that you are jealous or unhappy of him watching some naked lady(or ladies, or ladies and men) on the screen doing acrobatic tricks then its not really that good.<br><br>Concern for him is one thing but CONTROLLING him is another<br><br>------------------<br>Why? Why me?<br><br>[This message has been edited by EcK (edited 28 October 1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pink,<br><br>Believe me, he will soon get sick and tired of it after watching them. Basically there arn't new things often.<br><br>Yes, I do agree with Firewire that it is not right to demand him of this. Like what most of the reply in this forum says, this is actually not a big deal. To watch is much much better than go out somewhere and do it to someone else.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To musicWhiz:<br>It's nice to know that there're still guys like you around who dun indulge in porn =D<br><br>To the rest:<br>Often it will be one thing that leads to another. Then wouldn't pornography encourage a guy to want to try a variety of women? I think this porn stuff is an unhealthy influence  not only for him but everyone else, especially when we as Asians are still a rather conservative society.<br>(That's why I would prefer a christian/catholic boy given his staunch christian values even though I'm a free thinker.)<br>Anyway, I don't think porn n all is just about 'seeing' coz my there were some pics of Heather Graham in my bf's comp which meant that he actually took the trouble to download and save them into his drive.<br>Guys u prob think this is no big deal but at that time I was quite hurt especially when I realized he had some sort of a crush on her after he watched Austin Powers.<br>I  wanted to break up with him because it showed how shallow and immature he was (I mean crushing on a star? I thought it only happened to teenyboppers and not a 21 yr old!).<br>I guess I didn't break up with him after all (I had already wrote like half a break up letter) since we're still together but I still often have feelings of doubt whether I should stay on with him and I know it's all due to stuff like pornetc because other than that we are really happy together.<br>So my point is if a guy really cares about a girl, he shouldn't want to indulge in the likes of porn/ogling at other women etc.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sad to say, Pink, that age doesn't judge a person's mature-ness.<br><br>And physicologically, if he is deprive of something, he would even want more! So why stop him?<br><br>Those are only small obstacles stand between you and him. Trust me, there will be more when he jumps into the big society when two of you starts your career. Five yrs down the road, you might be laughing to yourself why are you bothering yourself on these small issues.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pink,<br><br>I agree that it is not right to indulge in pornography, but that doesn't make it wrong to look at them once a while. I mean as long as he is not obsessed with it.<br><br>The fact that you almost wanted to break up with him just because he had a crush on an actress is a reflection of how shallow you are too. I mean, you do swoon over some hunk actor too, don't you? Downloading a picture from the web doesn't tantamount to being obsessed with the actress, besides, it doesn't take a lot of effort, just a few clicks of the button. Just like some girls would download pictures of pooh bears or other stuff.<br><br>Blacking out what you do not like to see/hear is a barrier to change, which is also a barrier to improvement. Rather you should try to understand why your boyfriend has the urge to visit such sites. Sometimes, the mere fact that you disallow him to do so, merely encourages him to try to find out more about it. I admit I used to visit such sites, but after awhile I got sick of it and hasn't been back for quite a few months now.<br><br>Besides, it's quite insulting the way you said you prefer a staunch christian or catholic because they do not have such indulgence. You're indirectly suggesting that buddhism, hinduism, islam and other religions embrace pornography. Which is not true, any staunch believer in his/her own faith would do no such thing.<br><br>Finding a quick solution to a problem may appear to solve it, but it's definately not the best way to. Like I said, you must try to understand your boyfriend, and work out the problem. Just as he should try to understand why you are so against pornography. Work out a compromise which is mutually beneficial. Only then will your relationship flourish.<br><br>A relatioship without mutual respect, understanding and communication will surely fail.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pink, maybe indulgence in porn isn't a good thing. But when you say that if a man really loves a women she shouldn't even look at other women???<br><br>Its a known fact that men sometimes even if by some sort of reflex action will look at a goregous female (even subconsciously) that passes him.<br><br>Its not something that can be easily controlled unless he make an extremely conscious effort to do it. When he looks at some other women doesn't mean that he doesn't love you. Its just something thats hardwired into the male brain.<br><br>Its just the feeling that you have been betrayed that irks you and not his actions.<br><br>This is why when wives realise that their husbands are having affairs, feel betrayed not because he slept with another woman but rather that he had betrayed the love she thought they shared.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm, pardon me, but what is wrong with porn?<br>Well, I believe that it's way a of releasing your sexual desires. I believe that all of you had heard of wet dreams right?<br>Well, that is also another way. Thus, porn serves as a , well , method , if rather crudely.<br><br>Pink, I know you may feel disgusted that your boyfriend watches porn but perhaps you should just tolerate it at the moment, after you've been married, I think you would have a rather different view. Perhaps, just ask your boyfriend not to watch porn in front of you or let you see those pictures and you simply close a eye about it. =)<br><br>Thanks</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think all the above posts can only mean 1 thing - PINK, you don't understand guys at all.<br>Sure, we watch porn... so what? I've got a guy friend who also views porn from time to time, but he's one of the best bf any gal could have found. He treasures her, does nice things for her, has neva made sexual advances on her, and gets jealous when guys make advances on her!<br>And u know the best thing? He has his own mind! And he watches porn? get it?<br>But I pity him sometimes though, coz his current gf is very dear to him but she oftens make unreasonable demands of him, like no going out with other gers, NOT EVEN in group outings. He listens to her sometimes, but he did argue with her sometimes coz it's so obvious he treats them only as normal friends. I'm his best friend, I should know. And you know what? He watches porn!<br><br>I certainly hope something got into your head by now, PINK, or I'll feel sad for you  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>"When we remember we are mad, the mysteries disappear and life stands explained."<br>-Mark Twain-<br><br></div>
