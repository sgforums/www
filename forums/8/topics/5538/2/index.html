            <div class='col-md body'>Pink Fudge and every one else out there,<br><br>This will be the only letter for today until later tonight....Been awake all night.  Party, then came home and started to do new design for my website...:-)<br><br>Pinkfudge, u seem to suffer from an extreme case of possessiveness like my x did.  I know because I was living with it for 2 years, now I'm with another girl who makes really unreasonable demands of me also.<br><br>It seems that u have very little confidence in ur self and ur worth to ur boyfriend.  In a way u don't trust his feelings for u. That stems from u and not anything he says or does...unless he really tells u.<br><br>U also suffer from a form of severe ideological fantasy...  First off, it's really lame and shallow that u could even consider breaking off with him because of porn and/or pics of H. Graham.  U seem to think that people on this planet are meant to pair off and live like hermits until they die.  Being in love doesn't change anything at all.  Ur life doesn't change.  Ur feelings for urself and someone else changes.  Life still moves on the way it is supposed to move on.  Because a guy and girl gets together and/or marries doesn't mean that they exist only for each other.<br><br>Seems u've been reading too many romance novels by britney Spears or whatever their names are.  I'll tell u waht is trash.  Romance novels are.  I tell my GF so, but I still allow her to read them and would never even think about trying to impose some kind of limit on it...I voice out my opinion though because every time women read these books, they get the wrong idea of what love is supposed to be like.  It is the women's equivilant of porn, but worse because it reeaches into ur mind.  Porn is just a visual thing...easily forgotten and ultimately having little effect after the guy steps away from the monitor.<br><br>I posted a few days earlier about this whole fantsasy scenario.  No one is going to come riding on a white horse and snatch you to safety from these evil porn viewers so that u can live a blisfull life with the dream guy on a remote island.  U need to realise that life is simple, but not as simplistic as u would want it to be.<br><br>It's not just u, but a lot of girls also think the same way as u.  Every girl seems to think that if u love someone, noone else matters anymore.  Guys won't be attracted to anyone or even bat an eye if some super-model comes to our house and strips in front of us...  After reading ur posting, I seem to get the idea that u feel that once the guy becomes attached to a girl, he becomes indebted to her and must do the biddings of the female...not unlike a slave or servant...Believe me, it's much easier to just hire some guy to do all that.<br><br>And it seems that u value the thought of not viewing porn above all other qualities infitisimally more important to loving and relationship.  Have u been in many relationships?  In my observation, women are the least likely to learn anything rom the realtionship than men are...which is contrary to popular opinion.  If u want, I can discuss this with u more by email....<br><br>look at it this way, if the issue of porn is all u care about, then what are u doing with ur boyfriend in the first place?  If it's like that, then basically ur only requirement is that the guy can be anyway he wants, as long as he doesn't twitch his eyes when a girl walks by or watches porn.<br><br>U don't find it silly that u could even consider a break-up because of something so insignifigant?  It's like saying I would break up with my GF, who I love, because she reads romance novels.  If everyone thought like this, noone would get attached or married unless they only wanted to get children.....no love involved at all.<br><br>Ur love is a selfish one.  Is it that t all or are u with him because u fear being alone and are insecure about it.  I'm just assuming here.<br><br>Please, there are no perfect men here, and an equal if not more amount of women on this planet.  Love is about trusting ur partner.  it's about being able to let him do what he feels comfortable doing and still trust that ur at the top of his mind.  Believe me, I have tried and it's not easy to be going full steam in a relationship all the time.  Sometimes u need time away from each other...or is that also wrong...if u love someone, u wouldn't ever need to get away from them right?....I don't think so.<br><br>I am qualified to talk about these things as my GF is also really very foolishly demanding.  I always quarrel with her about why she always must demand me to do really silly things thathave no meaning at all.<br><br>Did u know that my GF doens't allow me to look up when we are outside and a pretty girl is around.  As long as she can see the pretty girl, she doesn't like me to look up or around.  If there's ugly people around, I can look.  Even when i'm looking at something and a pretty girl walks in front of me to pass by, she gets angry at me and accuses me of staring at her.<br><br>How utterly absurd, i can't very well go thru my whole life looking at the cement on the floor everytime there's people around.  She also doesn't like me to go out with gal friends in groups or singly, even though she can and does often go out with guys who like her and old friends and whatever.  i trust her, but obviously, there's a lack of trust on her part for meeven though she has shown that she's more capable of going astray than I am.<br><br>I just don't understand why women act like this...doesn't anyone realise that men have feelings also...and not all of us can be millionaires.  Not all of us can be exactly what u want...<br><br>As for my girlfriend, I totally disregard her requests if i find them totally unreasonable.  and usually she's smart or too scared to push it too much...but sometimes she does go overboard.  In the end, she knows that i would have no qualms about leaving if she makes life unbearable.  Love is love, but life is life.<br><br>If u cannot let ur partner live his life, tehn u haven't given him any kind of love at all.  We men aren't put on this planet just to be what women want us to be.  Ur lucky that ur female becasue they are the more privileged of the two sexes...a lot of women have an easy life, yet they can still somehow never appreciate it.<br><br>I really feel strongly for this subject so I will probably write more when I wake up....tonight is my 2 years anniversary of me and my GF.:-)<br><br>Pornography is not the enemy.  It is not the result of the enemy either.  The enemy exists within ur self.  If u cannot fight ur own feelings then u r losing the war with urself...our minds are so advanced yet we can still blame things that are so important on such a lame excuse as pornography.  Far better to blame it on the war in somalia.<br><br>I'm sorry for writing sucj harsh things and so disjointed and long, but at this time, shit is just coming out of my fingers at the speed of thought.  I hope that u will allow me to apologize when I log back on tonight...<br><br>Till then..<br><br>zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well Pink, I sincerely hope you don't have any problems with your bf just because you have some problems with him developing crushes on beautiful actresses or watching groups of people indulging mass orgies.<br><br>Worshipping idols, watching porn, stuff like such are phases everyone goes thru in their life. We grow out of some of these stuff and well, some of us don't. But if you really believe that your boyfriend shouldn't watch porn because its really bad for him, then instead of restricting him by just telling him you won't tolerate him watching it, I believe you should perhaps educate and convince him why he shouldn't watch it.<br><br>The human character is always flawed, and no one is perfect, so if your boyfriend is overall a great guy, why should you worry about him watching porn? As long as he doesn't turn into a pervert, there's nothing wrong with it.(IMHO)<br><br>------------------<br>Why? Why me?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Looks like Pinkfudge is on the receiving end of a lot of flak here today.<br><br>Although I admit I was the one who started calling her shallow for what she have done, I shall speak out on several points in defence of what pink has done.<br><br>It is understandable that most girls view pornography as distasteful, especially since it's based on the exploitation of their fellow gender. Who likes being exploited anyway??<br><br>Obviously porn is not fodder for the brain and neither does it contribute positively to society in anyway. (other than the big bucks porn lords earn from such sites, of which some might go back to charity in their attempt to lessen their guilt) So porn is viewed as a redundant medium that has absolutely no place in this world.<br><br>Explicitness and pervertness of porn sites (one can never imagine what other ideas they can come up with using bottles, vegetables and other stuff), only makes things worse, probably only the sick will want to feast their eyes on such sites. Well, that's true. BUT, most guys (or for me at least) just go in to laugh my head off at all those disgusting things they do, not to learn from them and try to experiment with my girlfriend. Neither will such sites make me horny enough to be sex-crazed and go around asking for sex.<br><br>Both parties have got their points in this controversial topic. Cheerio!</div>

She was everything (almost) that she can be and I've always loved her for being that way.<br><br>My mind was never dismayed just becos she's not as pretty as my friend's gf or watever.<br><br>Usually guys will go all out for porn even when they have gfs probably cos their gf is not providing them for the sexual desire or they have much higher sex drives than other guys.<br><br>Do question in 1 thing.

            <div class='col-md body'>To Pink,<br><br>Like what Enigma has said, I too agree that only when coupled with perverted thoughts and the willingness to carry those thoughts out do pornography present a threat to society, especially females as they will become targets for rape and molest. I visit porn sites, I guess I'm being shallow here but I prefer to get some sort of visual simulation when I need to relieve myself instead of just relying on my fantasies and imagination.<br><br>You also may like to ask why are you restricting him?? Is it because of jealousy? Betrayal? Then you have to look in your heart, can you feel his love for you?? Is he going to be less nice to you, less loving towards you after he visits porn sites? I love my girlfriend very much...I'm now studying, we have been together for only one year plus but it's as if it's been ages since we knew each other. We're also planning to get married after we graduate...and we visit porn sites. We are law-abiding citizens!!<br><br>Breaking up over porn sites is NOT worth it...rather, you should ask about whether he loves you or you love him. It's about making compromises, give and take. And don't be unreasonable...my girlfriend knows that she can't bend me to her will.<br><br>I do seriously hope that you will consider what I have just typed. If you love him, tolerate his quirks, but if you can't do that, try to change him gradually and use the soft approach. If successful, he will change without realizing it. Making demands won't help much.<br><br>Wishing you all the best in everything,<br><br>demonsbane</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Definately women are hard to figure out...and they are like this...I think that most guys and most women would agree...hands down.  Also, I think I mentioned earlier that ur bf shouldn't be doing this kind of thing either.  If he's trying to dictate ur life, then so can u dictate his...Of course it would be better if one of the party invovled didn't do the same thing, but in all fairness, usually these things don't stop at just one thing so u might as well go and be a bit controlling anyway...:-)<br><br>But it is hard to find an end to this.  Who's going to give in first.  Jealousy is a healthy thing and helps to let each other know that u still care, and it keeps couples from becoming complacent about their relationships.....But extreme jealousy is very bad.  It causes people to do crazy things...get my point?  :-)<br><br>But in any event, u two should try and work out why u r so jealous of such things.  Seems like there isn't much trust in each other or in  urself...What do u think?<br><br>How old r u anyway Fudge?</div>

Just face the fact, Most (I say most not all) guys, look at porn coz they are curious about females and sex..simple as that.<br><br>Pink...there is nothing wrong with what u r asking...just remember this, the forbidden fruit is always sweeter...the more u stop him, the greater the desire...why not let him do it...coz I am quite sure, after a while, he just find it boring and dull...he will give up after a while.<br><br>Finally, I agree fully with u that women are not an object of sexual satisfaction to men in this world, its those men who has a bigger male organ than their head who feels that way.<br><br>Just in case ppl get the wrong message, I am a full blown guy with a very high sex drive...but I never view women as a sexual object to fulfill my desires.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>'sex' is the most searched word on the internet and 'money' is the second...<br><br>so i guess the interest in it is really high...<br>porn... i think your bf will get sick of it after a while even if he surfs for it...<br>if a bf is obsessed with porn i think forget it,get another one but a little of it doesn't really hurt, i think.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Porn sites are kinda dumb. Imagine getting sexual satisfaction in front of a PC? I wouldn't want to imagine that. Curiousity kills the cat and after going to porn sites, that should settle one's curiousity and desire but it shouldn't be an obsession.</div>
