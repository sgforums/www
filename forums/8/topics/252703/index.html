Are you sure the American dollars will not reach its zero value, are u sure that the world will not go into Depression part 2 ?? Are u sure that the American economy can even survive this ??? So let alone the little tiny island Singapore. The singaporean PM already clearly stated that China's economy is now the driver of the southeast Asian economy, Southeast Asian prosperity now depends on China. So just think before you wish, if your wish came true then tell me where would this world go ?? where would singapore go ?? And where would ur life go since you are a singaporean. [/b]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>GuangDong Area is famous for pick pockets/robbery but there are worse provinces that overseas ppl doesnt know.<br><br>GuangXi area has high crime rate too, bcos it's the country boarder that connects to Vietnam, there many smuggling, and crimes related to drugs. But compared to Shanghai/GuangDong, foreigners doesnt visit GuangXi often, so most news we heard about thieves are from GuangDong area.<br><br>Yes, the public hates thieves, in coutry sides, if thieves are caught by the villagers instead of the policemen, by the time he reach the station, he's already half dead. In cities, it wont be that bad cos ppl are at least more civilised, you get some beatings, but not very jialet. (like the slapping case spinsugar mentioned, it's just slaps, not bashing you with some farming tools.)<br><br>There are many foreigners living in china or visiting china often, it's not like u go there u will 100% get robbed.<br><br>edit: sorry, for the TS's question.<br>You are going on tour or free and easy?<br>If tour, just stick close to the group, dont go around alone you should be safe.<br>If free and easy, just stay alert. Keep your money in a safe place. My dad has a pouch tied around his belly which is where he kept the money and travel documents, he keep a smaller amount in his wallet where he use it in public.

            <div class='col-md body'>There are some Singaporean idiots here so full of arrogance, prejudice and stupidity that they need to be put down with immediate effect so that our precious air is not wasted. For that matter, his immediate three generations need to be eradicated totally so that our human gene pools do not continue to be polluted by imbeciles. These scumbags are so bored and they live in such a low stratum of society that they have to occupy themselves with spreading malicious and hateful remarks of a country whose tremendous progress they are incapable of comprehending. These are the dimwits who would incessantly pick on another country's transient problems and blow them out of proportion just to feel good about themselves.</div>

I'll testify for beijing, china, 'cause people like to visit it, and 'cause I know it best (compared to other places).<br>for starters, I've lived here for 7 years, and I've only been robbed once. Okay, more specifically, my DAD only got robbed once. It was on a crowded bus.<br>If you dont wanna get robbed ... stay outta crowded places. sometimes when we walk through more re4nao4 places, we'll wear our bags in the front so that we can keep an eye on it. also, if you're really scared of getting robbed, just catch a taxi. they're really cheap over here. and despite rumors, they're actually pretty safe.<br>the shopping malls are fine also. my friend lost her wallet in this big shopping mall, but somehow, she managed to get it back in perfect condition. I lost a few books too in hotels, but I found them all back.<br>at night time, you've gotta be a lot more careful, 'cause you never know what's lurking out there =). but in the cbd, it should be quite okay. there are a lot of streetlights =).<br>the only thing you've gotta be careful of is people giving you ridiculously high prices when you go shopping. always remember to bargain. most of the time, products are 1/4 or 1/5 of their stated price. and remember to ask them if it shrinks and stuff. they probably wont admit it anyways, but a lot of the time, they say that if it shrinks, they'll give you a refund =).<br>btw, if you wanna look rich, buy a few fake nike shirts =). jkjk</div>
