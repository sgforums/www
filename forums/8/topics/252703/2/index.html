Those high rank officials, as long as they have good relations, they can take alot of bribes and they wont "bao doh" each other. When they earned enough, they run to overseas to enjoy life.<br><br>About the beggers, many are "organised", they catch small kids, bring them to a distant province, and make them beg on the streets, the money you give to those kids, they have to hand in to the "leaders" who controls them.<br><br>If you happen to know how much a factory worker earns daily, i think you wont be giving money to begger anymore. Those factory workers work hard for one whole day, and earns around 30-50RMB/day, and those beggers? they just walk around on the streets and earn more than those factory workers...... I dont think they deserve to earn that much. And many of the beggers are "fake", they say they need a few RMB to buy something to eat, you think u give me 5RMB he will leave??he will keep begging there. Your tour guide is right, dont give them a single cent.</div>
