            <div class='col-md body'>Now I am  26 years old. I have applied to a graduate medical school in australia (which is also recognised in Singapore) 4 years ago but couldn't accept because it was too expensive to study as an international student .<br><br>Now I reapplied as a permanent resident- passed the entrance requirements - went for an interview but the problem now is  if I get accepted and start medical school, I start at square 1 when I graduate , my earnings will drop by 30% when I start my medical career. Plus my mortgage will be a problem . My parents won't support the idea either ( altho I won't be asking them for financial assistance since I can support myself).  I calculated - when I graduate from med school - I will be 32 years old , plus to specialise is another 12 or so years in training . That means I will only be settled in my career when I am 44 years. And no - I am not doing medical school for prestige or glory - I just want to specialise in forensic pathology.<br><br>Right now my friends and colleagues are calling me crazy and telling me to do a PhD instead of med school because I have enough post grad qualifications plus working experience in my line now to be an educator or go up the career ladder.<br><br>Now between a dream and practicality .....if you were me - what would you do?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thank you for your opinions<br>Just in a conundrum over this<br><br>well I haven't received a reply yet from med school whether I am accepted or not but I was just reconsidering if I get in. My interview was not crash hot - they asked me why I wanted to do medicine. My answer was because I want to do forensic pathology . One of the interviewers nearly dropped his pen when I answered. He then asked me why ...so I just talked about it somewhere along the lines of establishing cause of death for the dead person as well as bringing closure to families. And yada yada about forensic pathology in using the information to understand science of death in the dead and living. He didn't look ok with my answer - I think he looked rather sick from my answer - I supposed they wanted to hear " oh I want to help the sick AND LIVING etc" .  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Hhehe maynot get in after all<br>I told my boss about it ....he was laughing his head off after hearing about my interview and said I had his highest points for originality....to the point he called me mad.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Follow your heart.  Otherwise, for the rest of your life, you'll be haunted by the 'What if's'.<br><br>I gave up a well-paid corporate job in a huge American MNC to take up my current career (you know what it is, fymk!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">) and suffered a more than 50% drop in income, a loss of my old status, a drastically deficient lifestyle and well, you know the rest of the awful working conditions I'm subjected to right now.<br><br>All said, I remain steadfast to my ultimate goal because 5.5 years ago, I had a vision and now, I am less than a year from achieving my dreams.  I suffered, sure, but soon, it'll all be worth it.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>So, I encourage you to embark on 'the calling' that a handful of us get to embark on our special career.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
