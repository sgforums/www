The same used to be said about Senna? don't forget McLaren spent 3 or 4 years in the wildnerness, from 1994 to 1996/97. Mika was with them since 93, it was 97 before he won with McLaren. same thing back in 76 with James Hunt. the thing is no team stays at the top forever. before 1999, ferrari had spent 20 years without any driver's championship. in fact they were in the wilderness for many years. right now McLaren is going thru a slump, but within a couple more years, their form will be back and Kimi will be synonomus with McLaren just as Mika was. and perhaps we might get the greatest and fiercest driver pairing since the Prost-Senna combination of 88.</div>
