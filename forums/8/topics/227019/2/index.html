You take the risks...<br><br>They know all the technicalities in local banking industry, and they are covered by their own laws which protects them.

            <div class='col-md body'>Banks nowadays are becoming more and more careless, and recruiting people who are not responsible and hold the highest code of ethics. Worst case scenario, is they pocket your money.<br><br>My own bad experiences:<br><br>1&gt; Credit Card bill from Stanchart: 12 out of 16 of the digits of my credit card number clearly visible to the public eye in the transparent envelope window!!<br><br>2&gt; UOB employee telling my mum <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">my</span></strong> account balance without my permission.<br><br>U may wonder why I am mad that UOB did that? Well, few years ago my mum and I bought some funds, over 90% of the amount is from me ( I was not even working then), and to my disgust I found that my mum had withdrawn all of it, and is not willing to return me <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">my </span></strong>money. I wouldn't be so calculative if my mother was not.. she's also very calculative with me. Some people have all the (bad) luck.<br><br>Definitely making a complaint against the UOB employee.. most likely it's the people's park bracnk... beware.. someone who doesn't respect confidentiality of others working there!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1. There are alot of terms and conditions in unit trust funds/Structural Deposits. Did your mum received a free gift when she place into it? If yes, the funds could be earmarked for a period, as the banks want to discourage people from withdrawing after a short time of placement just to get the free gift.<br><br>2. It could be pledge to some other credit facilities example a secured credit card, credit line, etc. The credit facility need not necessary belong to your mum.<br><br>3. The so called "branch of transaction" need not necessary be the branch where your mum went to do the transaction. It could be just the relationship manager that your mum place the funds with belong to another branch, or that the branch is used as a "default" branch for this particular unit trust purchase.<br><br>4. From what I know, earmarking is done by the staff manually, and not by the system automatically. It could just be a simple error on the branch side.<br><br>5. Misusing your mum's funds is highly unlikely, (although still a possibility), especially when it is purchased into a unit trust recently. Chances of misusing funds in fixed deposit and normal deposit accounts are higher.<br><br>6. And 2 words of advice: a) Please do not put what you put in the topic title (although a bit late to reach you). b) Never send a letter to the straits times or the like. Do that only after you have received replies from the bank concern, and only when you are not satisfied with their answer.<br><br>Merry christmas.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Unit trust is a investment vehicle. You put money into a fund managed by a or afew fund manager who will take all those money to invest in equities. Depending on the fund scope, it could be say Fund Spore, Fund Thailand etc which indicate the fund manager uses your money to invest in that particular country stock market. Think of unit trust as a basket of stocks manged by  professionals.<br><br>Btw bank sales charge so expensive at 5% usually. Should go Internet DIY to get much cheaper sales charge.</div>
