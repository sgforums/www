            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">by K.K. Cheow</span><br><br>The Gahmen today defended its decision to send 192 SAF personnel, including 15 full-time national servicemen, to Iraq without first consulting Parliament.<br><br>When even the British Prime Minister and the US President have to go to the House of Commons and Congress respectively before they can send troops into a war zone, this omission is rather glaring. This is especially when it is known that the terrorist forces are not only targeting the occupation forces, but also countries or organizations seen to show even a little friendliness to them, such as Turkey or Jordan.<br><br>The Opposition, while noting that due to its majority, the ruling PeopleÂ’s Action Party would be able to secure a parliamentary vote in its favour anyway, feels the GahmenÂ’s failure to even make a show of pretence that it cares about being consultative to be rather telling.<br><br>Said Singapore Democratic Party spokesman Noah Seet, Â“So much for all the Remaking Singapore bullshit. Looks like they remade Singapore to the exact same state as it was before.Â”<br><br>Meanwhile, Singapore PeopleÂ’s Party spokesman Mr. Chin Ah Chiam said, Â“At least wayang that you sayang, lah! ItÂ’s not an excuse to say, oh, weÂ’re just providing logistics support. The terrorists heck care such things. Remember, they also whacked the UN and the Red Cross. What more a foreign military force involving a naval vessel, a landing ship tank, anti-missile systems and an air-force transport plane!Â”<br><br>However, Deputy Minister of State for Defensiveness Mr. Khee See Leow defended the GahmenÂ’s actions.<br><br>Â“We do not believe we have breached SingaporeÂ’s democratic process in any way by bypassing Parliament,Â” said Mr. Khee. Â“Why should we have to run to parliament about less than two hundred people, when weÂ’ve rammed through decisions affecting many more people, such as redrawing electoral boundaries?Â”<br><br>Also, Mr. Khee said, Â“Our soldiers will look damn <span style="font-style: italic;">gu niang</span> if we have to ask for consent forms first.Â”<br><br>Besides, Mr. Khee said, the troopsÂ’ morale was high. Â“TheyÂ’re dying to go to Iraq. Even the NSFs who kena arrowed said, wah lau, better to die in real combat than to die in mock combat like those poor commando bastards.Â”<br><br>Mr. Khee also reiterated the important purposes of the mission. Â“Die-die must go, because we have to support our biggest client, oops, sorry, I mean, we have to work towards restoring global security.Â”<br><br>Mr. Khee finally paid tribute to the Â‘never say dieÂ’ spirit of our Iraqi contingent: Â“ItÂ’s probably the toughest mission of their lives. We donÂ’t know if theyÂ’ll can succeed, but I guess theyÂ’ll die trying.Â”<br><br>*extracted from <a href="http://www.talkingcock.com" rel="nofollow">here</a></div>
