You live because you are lucky to have enough food to eat, enough water to drink, a shelter over your head to keep the elements away from harming you. You live because you do not live in a war torn zone, no mines/no bullets/no enemies waiting in fear to kill you anyway cos if they don't they are dead. You live because your basic needs for living exists.<br><br>And because it exists (because for whom people that these basic needs are a struggle, the question THEY ask is "how do i continue to live?"), you will ask this question WHY you live? And often, they can find their answers in... WHO you live for, What you live for, and HOW you live.<br><br>And for many of THESE people, when their answers to who, what and how have been found unreliable, they tend to fallback to the Why again. cos its the safest rhetoric question around.<br><br>Who do you live for? I live for my family, my loved ones, my cats that I need to take care of, the kids that I work with<br><br>What do you live for? Simple things in life ba, fish and chips takeaway on my dining table right now for a cosy comfortable dinner, trips to beautiful and not so beautiful places that amazes me how big and different the world is... and how small when people's hearts touch each other<br><br>How I live? As fully as I can... and that means, lots of good food!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Alright I'll state my point of view.<br><br>Honestly, I think near 3/4 of the post were redundant, stupid as well? I somehow could predicted cloud's purpose in asking this question relates to some suicide thing. Questions were never meant to be stupid, everyone has different level of thinking. If you think you're so smart, post your own thoughts on this and we see how smart you are? I'm not targetting this on anyone but what's so smart in asking, "What handphone to buy, What girls to catch, What celebrity do people say you look like?" If you're telling me this kind of questions are less stupid than, "What is life all about?", think again.<br><br>Cloud: I'm gonna summarise my thoughts into one paragraph, and I hope it helps.<br><br>Basically, you're borned into this world for some purpose. I'm not a religion person, free thinker is the term? But I believe that each of us live for a reason. If you die, you typically screw up the system. You may feel lost now, as you don't have dream, targets or goals. Hence, many think, what's the point of living when we're all waiting for death? What I can suggest to you is that, do something you've never done before, try and explore. For instance, go overseas enjoy, go watch R21 movie with a gay, etc etc. I'm just giving you an example. IMO, Singapore is a boring place, but it is up to the individual on how they wanna spice up their lifes. There's just so much things in life you can do, sometimes I feel that I'll never live long enough to finish them all. Cherish your life and your family, your friends and all. No one will want anyone die just because they gave up on life.<br><br>Alternatively, I suggest you call those hotlines which can help you. You really need some proper help/guidance on this. And hey, I'm not a professional <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Cheers!</div>
