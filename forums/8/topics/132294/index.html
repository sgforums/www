            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys, i have an issue that i am not able to resolve. Although i got my driving license 8 months ago, i haven't had the chance to drive much as my parents did not trust me that much after i had a near-accident after i passed and drove them around. In addition, my dad uses the car on the weekdays for work and weekends to run errands, visit relatives etc..all of which i'm not interested in.<br><br>I'm sure all of you guys who drive know that driving in the real world is very different frmo test, learning conditions as u need to learn how to recognise roads, where to take the turns, overtaking etc. My dad always urges me to drive...alone..but i know that deep inside his heart he knows that i have problems driving after i got my license as i dunno the roads and am not used to the road conditions. I think i will be confident only if i know the roads, yet by driving without knowing the roads well, i might risk accident. Don't tell me about using the street directory, i'm not exactly that good in deciphering maps and memorising them and putting them to real road conditions to work.<br><br>Sigh...any of you guys have solutions as to how u gradually learned driving after your getting your driving license. I think i really lack practice in real life for my phobia of driving alone( yes, even now my dad sits besides me as a 'makeshift' driving instructor.) I really wish to learn driving so i can drive my friends around where they are the envy of all the gals.<br><br>Any suggestions as to how u got better? I know as a guy i should be technically proficient in driving. But trust, me driving just isn't my 'forte' and i think i need more time to master directions, navigation, quick decision making on the roads. Thanx guys for your time.</div>

I was able to drive with confidence in US as there isn't so many squeezy lanes and parking lots are so much bigger. I even drive up to 120 km/hr without fear.<br><br>The critical factor in driving with confidence (apart from practice) is the attitude of drivers. I had the subtle support from other californian drivers in giving me back my confidence in driving. They are so considerate to everyone - drivers, pedestrians, pets, wild animals even.<br><br>But when I came back, I feel paralyzed with the driving conditions here. I don't feel at ease driving here as Singaporean drivers have a huge attitude problem. (I got horned at the very second the red light turned green at a junction, telling me to move off. How impatient!)<br><br>If you must drive in Singapore, take it slow. I've learnt to go slow and keep strictly to speed limit (sometimes to the exasperation of some drivers who are so impatient. How cares!) Be safe and NEVER let impatient drivers intimidate you.<br><br>In the worst case scenario, if they knock into you, they would have to pay you. So go slow!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tritonyeah666:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi guys, i have an issue that i am not able to resolve. Although i got my driving license 8 months ago, i haven't had the chance to drive much as my parents did not trust me that much after i had a near-accident after i passed and drove them around. In addition, my dad uses the car on the weekdays for work and weekends to run errands, visit relatives etc..all of which i'm not interested in.<br><br>I'm sure all of you guys who drive know that driving in the real world is very different frmo test, learning conditions as u need to learn how to recognise roads, where to take the turns, overtaking etc. My dad always urges me to drive...alone..but i know that deep inside his heart he knows that i have problems driving after i got my license as i dunno the roads and am not used to the road conditions. I think i will be confident only if i know the roads, yet by driving without knowing the roads well, i might risk accident. Don't tell me about using the street directory, i'm not exactly that good in deciphering maps and memorising them and putting them to real road conditions to work.<br><br>Sigh...any of you guys have solutions as to how u gradually learned driving after your getting your driving license. I think i really lack practice in real life for my phobia of driving alone( yes, even now my dad sits besides me as a 'makeshift' driving instructor.) I really wish to learn driving so i can drive my friends around where they are the envy of all the gals.<br><br>Any suggestions as to how u got better? I know as a guy i should be technically proficient in driving. But trust, me driving just isn't my 'forte' and i think i need more time to master directions, navigation, quick decision making on the roads. Thanx guys for your time.</div></blockquote>ay no disheart!<br>got license good just keep it may come in handy later on. true...even if a chap failed during sriving test, does not mean that he cannot drive....we hav to waste time pay for the lessons and meaningless test so that we can get certified (even driving orso the same...even if u got no education still need to get certified to drive).<br><br>i got one solution for u...driving alone is cool and fun. take your father's car, pay for the gas u gonna burn to test drive on your own...drive at nite (or at roads where there are not much traffic) and get familiar with the roads.<br><br>i first started driving in the army, class 4 and even i got no civilian license, sometime back during incamp training i still have to drive (convoy movement) but if now i am back i got the chance i opt not to drive too.<br><br>do not disheart...coz those drivers wen they first started driving they orso blurr like sotong...this is the phase u hav to go through. as for roads, sometime u can orientate in your mind with the street directory, or cycle to get familiar with the roads (to save moeny and fuel)...etc. as for situation, u just hav to drive to learn how to react to it. but if u truely dun want to drive (just to make ppl happy)...dun endanger urself and the ppl around u. driving is not everything. if u ask me, i wolud prefer horse riding...more to learn about the manificient beast and communicate with her  when u ride...like the wind! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
