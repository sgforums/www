You have the highest social and financial status.<br><br>It's like when you hear Black people in the US saying that no one really knows what it's like when people always stare at them, worried the Black guy is going to beat the crap out of them because they are a gang member or drug dealer, every single day of their lives.<br><br>You hear the sentence.<br><br>But you dont truly know what it means or feels like. ( i sure dont. I've been discriminated against, but not feared).<br><br>Btw, it's pretty normal for them to give you the bill. Whenever my parents used to take us kids out for lunch or dinner, the waiter always gave the bill to Dad, not Mum. They'll give it to the person who looks like the bill payer. Nothing unusual about that.</div>

I see Singaporeans spit, pick their nose and pick their feet in Kopitiums, MRT trains and public in general every day.<br><br>2. Singaporeans give you the evil eye at shops too. Not just that. Ever been to the camera shop and either been overcrowded by staff, or totally ignored and stared at?<br><br>3. I usually see a parent let their kiddies urinate into drains at HDB's at least once a month. Ok, it's better than adults doing it , but SG ppl are still publicly pissing.<br><br>4. No need to remind anyone about getting on trains and buses without letting anyone off. I think it's an art form in SG. Be proud.<br><br>5. Singaporeans squat on footpaths spreading their legs just as much as China people do. Remember the bruhaha when a HK mag showed Zhang Ziyi squating outside a shop window? Yep, you do it too.<br><br>China is still mostly uneducated. People expect they are going to be thick, inflexible and uncultured.<br><br>Even if SG ppl behave slightly better than China ppl, Singapore has had almost 30 years of continuous educated prosperity. SG is supposed to be First World.<br><br>Being better than China is like the US saying it has a stronger military than the Vatican.<br><br>What's your excuse?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
