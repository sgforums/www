            <div class='col-md body'>No Asian likes it when an Asian woman who is not a 3rd Worlder chooses a white guy over her own kind.<br><br>It's like this.<br><br>Your wife is a slim good looking smooth skinned Singaporean (95% likelihood of being attractive).<br><br>Thus she has her choice of any guy.<br><br>In Singapore, Asian guys outnumber White guys approx 100 to 1 (1% of pop'n is caucasian).<br><br>So in choosing you, she has made an active decision to choose a White guy over an Asian guy.<br><br>So it's no wonder everyone regards her as little more than your trophy, and she dislikes her own.<br><br>It's just a step further than the bimbo who marries a rich guy for his money, except the bimbo is practising financial discrimination, not silent racial discrimination.<br><br>Native Asians have always smiled more at Caucasians than their own Asians.<br><br>Native Asian are also notoriously worse in terms of manners.<br><br>(I know I know.....you have to look at everyone as an individual blah blah....but when 90% of "individuals" dont hold open a door for me, or thank me for opening a door etc....well........)<br><br>Actually, I find many Asian girls from Asia who study or live in Australia are quite snobbish. They are quite in demand there so there are less Asian girls around.<br><br>Sydney- 600,000 Asians of all countries.<br><br>Singapore- 3,000,000 Singaporeans (not inc 1 million foreigners)In fact, most attractive Singaporean girls in Western countries end up with White guys.<br><br>(plus 6 million Chinese Malaysians across the bridge)<br><br>OP- no doubt you have respect for your wife.<br><br>But overall, would you feel comfortable if all the English white babes suddenly ignored all white men and only married Asians?<br><br>It's like once they are a certain level, their own kind are not good enough for them and they move up to others?<br><br>That's how SG females who choose White Guys make Asians feel.<br><br>ie- your mother would not have married your father.<br><br>Kate Garraway, Keira Knightly, Emily Math(cant remember her name) etc etc....<br><br>All babes, all would avoid their own Englishmen and prefer Asians.<br><br>I dont think you, or England, would like it.<br><br>If you think your love was pure, ask her this...If you were a Bangala, or Malay, or Indian, even if you had the same personality, would she have even noticed you?<br><br>As for being given the bill, as someone above said, you are obviously the money earner and in charge, so you will be saddled with the bill!<br><br></div>

Not many asian guys can handle this type of personality because they seem to want this beautiful stereotype of a girl who is very <span style="font-style: italic;"> teh </span>  and act cutsey all the time with stupid giggles .<br><br>Most singaporean guys I know like these type of stick insects with this type of character .  That's beautiful in Singaporean terms - never mind if the personality is reflective of the odorous stench of a sewage pipe with a blessed face of a horse. <span style="font-style: italic;"> OoooH she is so pretty </span>  ( yeah right ...she probably qualify for miss malnourished/anorexia  of the year)<br><br>So yeah when a Singaporean girl finds someone who appreciates her for who she is not what she appears to be - be it caucasian , polynesian or even native american ( I am not talking caucasian americans) ....suddenly she is snobbish and won't even look at the poor single Singaporean guy . Well you cannot win either way .<br><br>You have happy Singaporean couples - and I am happy for them , as well as ,happy mixed couples which of course, I am happy for them.<br><br>Let's wish them all the best and if they stick their noses up at us, let's stick out a leg to bring them literally back to earth and eat humble (mud) pie<br><br></div>
