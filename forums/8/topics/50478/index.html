You work hard, and play even harder. Temperance is not your middle name! You do everything with gusto: eating, playing squash, making love. You always "live in the moment" and have strong faith in your future.<br><br>Yet as an Aries, you lack patience. You look for quick results in all things, including exercise and diet. The human body doesn't always work on your timeline, so you may have to get used to nature's slower pace. Luckily, you won't likely have a problem with weight gain, since Aries is always on the go.<br><br>You excel at strenuous team sports and exercise regimens, because your ruling planet Mars "the warrior," imparts to you awesome strength, endurance, confidence and drive. Highly competitive, Aries can also outlast any opponent out of sheer determination. Highly goal-oriented, Aries wants to win and does!<br><br>Strenuous activity calms you down, so you feel wonderful after a good workout. Try vigorous sports such as martial arts, wind surfing, rollerblading, football, softball, basketball, gymnastics, boxing, jumping rope. Mars rules iron, so try weight lifting or fencing too.<br><br>Aries can overheat, so keep drinking water. In foods, Aries loves hot and spicy, so stock up on some delicious salsa to add zest to broiled chicken or fish.<br><br>You could experience headaches from tension. Important: since your teeth are in your head, the part of the body ruled by your sign, watch your teeth as a source of pain and see your dentist on a regular basis!<br><br><strong>Your Biggest Asset:</strong><br>Enthusiasm and the vitality of the Energizer bunny.<br><br><strong>What Drives You Crazy:</strong><br>Not enough stimulation: "I'm bored!"<br><br><strong>Health Risks:</strong><br>Doing too much and not knowing your limit.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fitness for Taurus (Apr 20 - May 20)</span></strong><br><br><strong>Your Ruling Planet:</strong><br>Taurus is ruled by Venus, the planet of beauty, luxury and comfort.<br><br><strong>The Part Of The Body Your Sign Rules:</strong><br>Taurus rules the throat.<br><br><strong>Your Metabolism:</strong><br>Low.<br><br><strong>Your Health Profile:</strong><br>As a Taurus, you are aware you use all of your senses to explore the world. How something feels, sounds, smells or tastes matters to you--a lot. You love sex, good food, the touch and feel of certain fabrics against your skin (not to mention skin against skin), and are very responsive to beautiful music. Yet you are also a creature of comfort and can become a couch potato as a result. A Taurus tends to be sedentary rather than athletic. An innate fondness for chocolate and French cuisine can pack the pounds on you, Bull, and inactivity combined with a high-speed modem at home or 77 cable channels on your TV can wreak havoc.<br><br>Work with your sensual nature, rather than against it, to keep a program of regular physical exercise a fun part of your life. Instead of your beloved old sweats, shell out for comfortable and flattering clothing to wear at the gym. Bring along your portable tape player and earphones so you can listen to your favorite music, and treat yourself occasionally to an after-workout sauna and message. Women Taurus seem to be especially responsive to aroma-therapy massage. When your muscles are aching as you pull into that last abdominal crunch, just remind yourself that exercise always makes your sex life more active and pleasurable.<br><br>If you find a sport you enjoy--make the most of it! Take your bicycle through a beautiful or unexplored area. When you swim, don't get locked into lapping around your gym pool forever. This summer, try taking a field trip to the old swimming hole you used to frequent as a kid. Maybe you and an intimate friend could sneak in a skinny dip! Taurus loves greenery and flowers, so working in your garden could give you the dual benefits of gorgeous tomatoes and firm calves and arms. The point is, if you can enjoy the experience you are more likely to stick to it.<br><br>Don't be radical with your eating habits, Taurus. If you allow yourself to feel deprived sooner or later The Bull will see red! The trick is to gradually make healthy changes in your diet so that you keep your enthusiasm--and your metabolism--high. Don't give up if you reach a plateau. Since you are ruled by Venus, a fairly hedonistic, pleasure-seeking planet, you will have the most success if you get regular rewards. So write down all the milestones that get you to your final goal and list a reward for yourself (a healthy one!) next to each milestone.<br><br>Finally, Venus will give you a memorable a memorable, melodic speaking voice (perhaps even an ability to sing), but you will be more subject to sore throats and laryngitis in winter as a result. Keep drinking your breakfast juice, and if you do get a sore throat, drink tea with honey and lemon or gargle with warm salty water for relief.<br><br><strong>Your Biggest Asset:</strong><br>A will of iron and plenty of persistence!<br><br><strong>What Drives You Crazy:</strong><br>Having to rush through anything. Sports that require lightening-fast reflexes and agility, such as squash, don't usually appeal to you. What you are more likely to enjoy are sports that require concentration and good hand-eye coordination, such as archery, marksmanship, and golf.<br><br><strong>Health Risks:</strong><br>Inertia keeps you glued to the past, even in sports and fitness. Your memory of being picked last in grade school could keep you out of shape permanently, if you allow it to. C'mon Taurus--if you try it I promise you'll like it!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fitness for Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</span></strong><br><br><strong>Your Ruling Planet:</strong><br>Gemini is ruled by Mercury, the communicative, inquisitive planet that guides rational and intellectual thinking. The element Mercury is also nicknamed "quicksilver" because it changes form in the flash of an eye.<br><br><strong>The Part Of The Body Your Sign Rules:</strong><br>Gemini rules the nervous system, as well as the arms, shoulders, hands and lungs.<br><br><strong>Your Metabolism:</strong><br>High<br><br><strong>Your Health Profile:</strong><br>Spontaneity is one of your greatest assets, but it can do you in when dinner time rolls around and you find (1) you don't have anything healthy to eat in the house and (2) you have no interest in cooking something healthy even if you did have the ingredients. Eating too many processed foods and TV dinners can make you feel lousy, as my Gemini editor can attest.<br><br>Gemini is always doing two things at once. When you eat, rather than read or talk, concentrate on the flavors. Otherwise you might not remember having eaten at all! Luckily, your sign is usually slim. This is because you were born with an abundance of nervous energy and are normally in perpetual motion. But being slim does not always translate into being healthy. Resolve to eat more fresh foods. Gemini is the sign of the writer, so if you discover your behind has welded itself to the chair in front of your computer, be sure to pry yourself away, and get up and go. Brisk exercise will help your mood as well as your health!<br><br>If you ever find yourself with a weight problem at all, it is because of nervous tension. You tend to eat quickly, obsessively, to calm yourself down. At those times, you find yourself consuming crunchy foods (popcorn, pretzels, chips) to get out your aggression. Try eating a crisp, fresh apple instead.<br><br>The lungs and upper part of your body needs strengthening, so start doing some aerobics or jogging. Working out on the Nautilus or Nordic Track would be ideal. Gemini likes quick, active sports that stress agility rather than anything slow and meditation-like (like yoga), which might make you fidgety (there are exceptions, of course). Since you are prone to bronchial problems, you need to take extra-good care of your lungs, and avoid anything that could lessen their ability to perform! You know what that means, so I won't be your Mom and tell you again: don't smoke!<br><br>All Gemini are prone to illnesses that stem from nervous tension. Therefore, it is more important for you than most signs to find ways to unwind and keep life in its proper perspective. If you can afford to, get away frequently on weekends. The change of scene will give you gentle stimulation and relax you at the same time. Vitamin B complex addresses anxiety, so make sure you get enough--take more if you think you are lacking. Small frequent meals might give you more energy than one or two big ones--as long as they are nutritious and not junk food!<br><br>Oddly enough, tension goes not to your neck so much as to your hands and fingers (probably because you are at the keyboard all the time--like now!) Women Gemini may want to treat themselves to soothing, hot cream manicures. Gemini guys can talk their sweethearts into extra-long arm and hand massages--with special attention from the elbow to fingers--with special oils and creams.<br><br><strong>Your Biggest Asset:</strong><br>Versatility and flexibility. Gemini needs variety to keep from getting bored, so keep switching your routine. Your agility is legendary, so physical activities such as aerobics, dance, gymnastics, basketball, or tennis should be lots of fun for you. P.S.: You always look younger than you are--lucky Twin!<br><br><strong>What Drives You Crazy:</strong><br>Same-old, same old. You need change, so avoid anything too routine.<br><br><strong>Health Risks:</strong><br>Flip-flopping from one fitness program to another without properly learning the first and seeing whether it works or not.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fitness for Cancer (June 21 - July 22)</span></strong><br><br><strong>Your Ruling Planet:</strong><br>Cancer is ruled by the moon, the planet that governs emotion, compassion and the nurturing of others.<br><br><strong>The Part Of The Body Your Sign Rules:</strong><br>Cancer governs the stomach and for women, the breasts.<br><br><strong>Your Metabolism:</strong><br>Low<br><br><strong>Your Health Profile:</strong><br>Cancers worry, and when they do, their tummies feel it first. This is due to a sensitive stomach. Never eat when you are emotionally stirred-up. Some Cancers overeat in an effort to find comfort from food, other Cancers avoid food altogether when emotionally upset. Find a course for yourself that is moderate, neither too little or too much eating when you're not feeling your best.<br><br>Cancer is sensitive to the phases of the moon, which can cause them to feel moody. Give yourself--and others--a little slack near full moon periods! You may need a little more privacy during that time. Be sure you are getting enough of the vitamin B series of nutrients, which help you deal with stress.<br><br>Cancers have a very sensual nature--more so than many of the other signs. If a sport or exercise program "feels" good in a physical sense, it is likely to stay a part of your routine. You may love water sports, since Cancer is a water sign and finds being near water is akin to going back to the womb. Don't disregard the power of water for you--it works magic on your nerves. Swim, run on the beach, sail, wind surf, or try white water rafting--anything water-related! Avoid fitness programs that are overly-regimented, which you will rebel against. You particularly like exercise that has a steady, rhythmic flow. Aqua-cize, calesthenics that are done in a pool using the weight of the water as resistence, could be soothing and strengthening at the same time.<br><br>Cancer may be the most nurturing sign of the zodiac, but creating and tasting those delicious meals you cook up for your loved ones may be hard on your waistline. Don't stop cooking--you enjoy it and you're great at it! Instead, switch to lighter fare. Check out recipes that combine great flavor with interesting texture (Cancer's standard of excellence) and experiment!<br><br>Women: watch your salt intake. You could have particular problems with water retention, giving you painful breasts and increasing the symptoms of PMS. Schedule yearly mammograms after the age of 40, sooner if there is a family history indicating possible problems. Careful with your eating habits, as I mentioned above. If you develop an eating disorder, get help.<br><br>Finally, Cancer men and women of all nationalities have some of the most radiant, beautiful and translucent skin, which usually makes them look younger than they are. However, since a Cancer's skin is delicate, it could be damaged by sun. (After all, moonlight is your specialty--not daylight!) Be sure to regularly use a moisturizer that includes a sun screen, even if you live in a northern climate with gentle light.<br><br><strong>Your Biggest Asset:</strong><br>A strong sixth sense. Let your intuition guide you to the right sport or workout rather than be influenced by the latest trend.<br><br><strong>What Drives You Crazy:</strong><br>Interruptions. You need to work out somewhere where others won't distract you--or bug you.<br><br><strong>Health Risks:</strong><br>Allowing yourself to become so busy taking care of everyone else's needs that you forget to care for yourself. Also, Cancer has a propensity to look back with regret. Keep your eyes on the horizon, Cancer, not what happened in the past! For example, if you were heavy and out-of-condition as a child, you can still reinvent yourself, making yourself slim and fit now.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fitness for Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</span></strong><br><br><strong>Your Ruling Planet:</strong><br>The Sun, the giver of life, which gives you strength, vitality and confidence.<br><br><strong>The Part Of The Body Your Sign Rules:</strong><br>Leo rules the heart, back and spine.<br><br><strong>Your Metabolism:</strong><br>Medium to high.<br><br><strong>Your Health Profile:</strong><br>A fire sign, Leo is known to be happy and warmhearted. Keep your heart healthy and fit with good nutrition and frequent aerobic exercise. You're happiest in a social setting, so don't work out alone. Join a health club or exercise class to get the best results. Leo loves music too, so you probably would like to work out to lively music. Lionesses especially love to move to music, so try going out dancing, maybe to a techno rave or a salsa club. Male Leos like macho, commanding sports, so if you're king of the beasts get in touch with your animal nature by learning how to kickbox!<br><br>You will love the attentions of your own personal trainer, and be insured of great results! Anything tailored just to your needs and tastes will give you support and confidence--and a chance to achieve your personal best. Note this also applies to coaches: for sports like tennis and golf.<br><br>Leo needs exercise that strengthens his or her spine and back. Leo also needs to maintain agility. Power walking could be useful on both counts as well as Pilates, Yoga or calisthenics classes. Since your sign adores fun and games, hit the park for strenuous athletic fun, such as basketball, or organize a softball team. Sign up to compete on a regular basis--it won't feel like a regimen this way. Leo doesn't like to be in a routine rut. When you travel, pick warm climates. Leos as a rule don't like to feel cold or clammy.<br><br>In terms of eating, you don't like to fuss too much, unless you're putting on a lavish spread for company. Your favorite way of handling dinner is to order out or go to a restaurant to eat, because you enjoy being served. Collect takeout menus of places that have healthful, low-fat meals. This will help you avoid falling into the fast-food trap. All those tacos will create havoc with your sleek, muscular, leonine form! Like Libra, Leo likes to party, but too much alcohol and frequent late hours will drag you down quickly. Learn when you need to say when.<br><br><strong>Your Biggest Asset:</strong><br>Looking good. Face it: vanity is your most powerful motivation.<br><br><strong>What Drives You Crazy:</strong><br>Working out anywhere that's too cold is not good (after all, you are ruled by the Sun!), whether it is indoors or out. Forget skiing (snow is not usually your "thing"), hockey or figure skating. Instead go rollerblading, biking, or horseback riding out on the open range! Also, sitting in a windowless cubicle for too long without a break will make you out of sorts. Especially in winter, be sure you get your daily dose of sunshine to combat the blues.<br><br><strong>Health Risks:</strong><br>Your enthusiasm peaks quickly and sometimes cannot be sustained. Avoid burnout by commiting to a varied program of cross-training to insure you're always doing something you like.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fitness for Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</span></strong><br><br><strong>Your Ruling Planet:</strong><br>Virgo is ruled by Mercury, the inquisitive, intellectual and objective planet.<br><br><strong>The Part Of The Body Your Sign Rules:</strong><br>Virgo rules the lower digestive track.<br><br><strong>Your Metabolism:</strong><br>High.<br><br><strong>Your Health Profile:</strong><br>Virgo's lower tummy (intestinal tract) is, unfortunately, the first part of his or her body to feel stress. Before you run for the Milk of Magnesia, try making a change in your lifestyle that can prevent these attacks. Meditation and an exercise program that emphasizes total-body relaxation and proper alignment will appeal to your perfectionist tendencies, while combating their inevitable physical effects. Fortunately for you, Virgo, you tend to stay slim.<br><br>As the rest of the zodiac knows, never tell a Virgo to relax! A Virgo likes to keep busy and productive. In an average day you do the work of two people... or maybe four! Realize that others may be better able to take the time they need to put their feet up and relax, but having them watch you work makes you feel like a doormat. Learn to delegate chores and responsibilities. Set up a system of initiatives for those close to you. Allow for the fact that people will always do things on their own schedule (not yours) and "perfectly clean" anything isn't always possible.<br><br>Virgo is one who must be careful with his or her diet. You tend to eat the most fresh fruits and vegetables of all the signs, not surprising since Virgo rules the autumn harvest. Many Virgos are vegetarian. Just be sure you are getting a wide variety of all the right foods, since it will take good organization to be sure you are not missing iron, or any other nutrient, from your diet. Happily, Virgo is the world's greatest planner and well organized about anything and everything in life.<br><br>You do have the tendancy to see things in black-and-white extremes. Don't dump your diet for one transgression! Since you like things orderly, keep a food diary, or draw up a chart of your progress at the gym. Since Virgos need all the de-stressing they can get, add some easy, pleasant exercises to your routine just for the fun of it, like biking or walking. Everything doesn't have to be a project.<br><br>Most importantly, distract yourself now and then. Virgo worries. Virgo worries a lot! You run the risk of going a little overboard and getting somewhat compulsive. Remember Virgo: tomorrow is another day.<br><br><strong>Your Biggest Asset:</strong><br>Your best quality is great endurance, rather than brute strength. Try sports that require going the distance, like hiking, cross-country skiing, long-distance running, and, for the iron-man and iron-woman Virgo: triathalons! Just don't expect to have deep and abiding love for sprinting or downhill skiing.<br><br>Your sense of organization and sometime-motto "anything worth doing is worth doing well" are other Virgo assets, provided you don't go overboard.<br><br><strong>What Drives You Crazy:</strong><br>If you haven't caught my drift by now--it's you! You can be your own worst enemy, Virgo. Stop driving yourself crazy by worrying about what might happen. Go for it!<br><br><strong>Health Risks:</strong><br>Yes, all great athletes are driven, to some degree and yes, being physically fit means being careful with what you eat and do. But being too obsessive or driven can also mean stress fractures, muscle pain and unnecessary disappointment. It's good to strive, but you can over do it, too. Overweight Virgos (there may be one or two) beware: an eating disorder could crop up if you let your perfectionist tendencies run riot.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fitness for Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</span></strong><br><br><strong>Your Ruling Planet:</strong><br>Libra is ruled by seductive, adorable Venus, planet of beauty, love, fun, and comfort.<br><br><strong>The Part Of The Body Your Sign Rules:</strong><br>The lower back.<br><br><strong>Your Metabolism:</strong><br>Low.<br><br><strong>Your Health Profile:</strong><br>Few signs are as well groomed and polished as yours. Libra generally takes good care of his or her body (crowding your shelves are body lotions, shampoos, and moisturizers), but you could be neglecting to take into account the influence of what you put into your mouth. Your weakness? Sweets. But don't banish them forever. Instead, indulge your love of quality, sensuality and flavor all at once by treating yourself to one tiny, superb Godiva chocolate daily--and savor it. Otherwise you will find yourself with both your body size and craving for treats growing exponentially out of proportion! Sneak snacking is a classic Libra diet problem.<br><br>Libra also loves to party but keeping up with hectic club scenes can make you lose track of time, and rob you of sleep. You cannot make up for lost rest and consistent self-care, you can only repair the damage. So get back home at a reasonable time for most of your nights out.<br><br>The ultimate partnering sign, Libra does best when they team up with another person in any exercise program. Tennis (doubles!), squash, basketball, golf, volleyball, square dancing, sailing and other sports and activities that require a partner are all perfect for you to try.<br><br>Finally, pay attention to the condition of your lower back. Learn calisthenics to strengthen the muscles in this area and drink lots of water and cranberry juice to stay healthy on the inside, too.<br><br><strong>Your Biggest Asset:</strong><br>Grace, balance and good coordination. Try any sport which requires them, like gymnastics, golf, ball room dancing, and platform diving.<br><br><strong>What Drives You Crazy:</strong><br>Physical ugliness in all its manifestations, from having a bad hair day, to working out in a poorly-decorated gym, to wearing a scruffy old sweatshirt will repel and depress you.<br><br><strong>Health Risks:</strong><br>Libra runs the risk of being too social at the gym, and forgetting why he or she came in the first place. Checking out attractive people, spending time at the juice bar catching up on gossip, getting involved with a clique, none of these things is helping you keep fit, Libra. But don't let your pendulum swing too far to the opposite extreme. Pushing yourself too hard until you drop from exhaustion or injury won't keep you fit either. Keep yourself in balance and harmony.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fitness for Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</span></strong><br><br><strong>Your Ruling Planet:</strong><br>Scorpio is ruled by both Mars, the planet of energy and aggression, and Pluto, the planet of transformation and rebirth.<br><br><strong>The Part Of The Body Your Sign Rules:</strong><br>Scorpio rules the reproductive organs.<br><br><strong>Your Metabolism:</strong><br>High.<br><br><strong>Your Health Profile:</strong><br>Intense, driven and often secretive, Scorpio needs an outlet for your powerful emotions more than any other sign. You can be obsessive, and have an "all or nothing" determination about whatever you do. When Scorpios decide to diet, they can go overboard. This can be harmful if it leads to yo-yo dieting or an eating disorder. Still, whatever a Scorpio puts their mind to, they usually accomplish.<br><br>You'll need be smart about channelling any pent-up frustrations into healthy, stress-relieving activities. Boxing, long-distance running or a fast game of squash (any strenuous sport is good) could help you use up all that energy and stress before it starts to hurt you. Although your sign is highly competitive, you prefers to be alone when trying to unwind. The term "personal best" had to be coined by a loner Scorpio. Scorpio usually does not like to work out in teams or groups. Try the Stairmaster, weight lifting (Mars governs iron), or gymnastics. Slow jogging, or yoga combined with meditation are good ways to get the kinks out. Of course, the fact that exercise is good for your sex life should be a big motivating factor for any hot-blooded Scorpio!<br><br>Realize that Scorpio rules the reproduction organs and a Scorpio without physical affection will soon feel sad or lonely. If your sex life is less than ideal, talk things out with your sweetheart, or get some counseling. Everyone, not just sexy Scorpios should follow safe sex procedures--not only to avoid AIDS but for unintended pregnancy and any number of sexually transmitted diseases.<br><br>You have a rich and varied emotional life to say the least! Be sure to share your problems with those close to you as soon as they occur (not months later, which is Scorpio's tendency.) Realize that the demands you place on yourself are higher than those anyone else would impose on you. You continually try to pack as much as possible into every day. Take time to look around you once and awhile. Remember too that you can get to be obsessed with things; try for more balance.<br><br><strong>Your Biggest Asset:</strong><br>Your unwavering determination and commitment to success in all things.<br><br><strong>What Drives You Crazy:</strong><br>People who waste time socializing at the gym. You have no time for that--you're going for the burn!<br><br><strong>Health Risks:</strong><br>Don't be so inflexible, dear Scorpio. Life often calls upon us to dump what we're doing and go to Plan B.</div>

Being a Sadge almost guarantees that you'll excel in at least one sport. More Olympic champions are Sagittarius than any other sign. You've got a lot going for you: strength, your own natural rhythm, speed and the confidence you'll win (Jupiter sees to that). Outgoing, funny and social, you enjoy being with friends when you exercise and like a little friendly rivalry to engage your active mind.<br><br>Sports like archery, fencing, rock climbing (or wall climbing in a gym), polo, horseback riding, or white river rafting would keep you focused and excited while you're getting fit. It's not by chance I mention equestrian sports: your symbol is the Centaur: half man, half horse, so you and horses can share a special affinity. Sagittarius rules travel, so hiking, camping, rock climbing, canoeing--anything that will keep you in locomotion--are good.<br><br>There isn't a sport you wouldn't try and as a result, your body is probably the envy of your friends. Sagittarius intuitively feels the link between body and mind and regularly seeks ways to strengthen both.<br><br>Your biggest weakness: butter and other fats. Ruled by Jupiter, you could be drawn to rich foods. Since your sign rules the hips, that's where the excess pounds will wind up if you're a woman, and if you're a guy, you'll begin to see "love handles." You don't like limits or restrictions, which can sabotage your determination to slim down. Luckily, most Sadges move around so much, they tend to lose fat easily if they put their minds to it.<br><br>Do calisthenics if you can't get to the sports you love. Take calcium early in life to keep bones (and especially hip and pelvic bones) strong.<br><br><strong>Your Biggest Asset:</strong><br>Your eagerness to try new things, your innate strength and your curiosity about how far you can go.<br><br><strong>What Drives You Crazy:</strong><br>"Don't Fence Me In" is your song, cowpoke. The great outdoors was made just for you.<br><br><strong>Health Risks:</strong><br>Being too undisciplined to exercise when you should, but don't feel like it. Excuses, excuses...</div>

However, the Goat tends to work long hours and forget about how late it's getting. Too often, you're stuck with having a fatty, salty late-night pizza by time you get home. No matter how tight your deadlines, try to eat a little bit better. Plan ahead. Enlist help from your roommate or family members to help you do bigger, and therefore fewer, shopping expeditions. Either freeze two dozen nutritious frozen dinners or find a better, less greasy place to order up food.<br><br>Keep in mind that Capricorns, the Spartans of the zodiac, are very self-critical and hard on themselves, especially when they think they've been "lazy." They want to look their best, and feel that maintaining a positive self-image will help in their business life. And so it will. But don't take this as a license to torture yourself.<br><br>In terms of exercise, your sign is an earth sign, preferring leisurely sports such as hiking or jogging, where you can set your own rhythm. Golf, even miniature golf, would be fun for you, or rock climbing, for Goats like to feel the earth beneath their feet.<br><br>Stiffness in joints could be a problem even when Capricorns are young, so keep exercising to stay limber. Knees could be your weak body part, so don't overstrain them. Weight training might be good, but check with your doctor if you have knee trouble.<br><br><strong>Your Biggest Asset:</strong><br>Your competitive drive and self-discipline.<br><br><strong>What Drives You Crazy:</strong><br>Being stuck in long, unproductive meetings when you could be working out.<br><br><strong>Health Risks:</strong><br>Being too competitive and getting yourself depressed if you don't meet your expectations, and worrying about what others think of your performance. Please yourself, Capricorn. Repeat after me: "It's only a game."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fitness for Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></span></strong><br><br><strong>Your Ruling Planet:</strong><br>Aquarius is ruled by surprising, innovative and inventive Uranus.<br><br><strong>The Part Of The Body Your Sign Rules:</strong><br>Aquarius rules the ankles and circulatory system.<br><br><strong>Your Metabolism:</strong><br>High.<br><br><strong>Your Health Profile:</strong><br>People are often either more physical or intellectual. Your sign is highly intellectual, so you tend to "live in your head." You are sometimes surprised when your body complains, reminding you that it needs care!<br><br>Your ankles are your weak point, so be careful if you ballet dance, ice skate, do gymnastics or ski. Support them with an ace bandage if that feels better. Your circulation is sensitive too. So you need to keep warm, and put circulation-strengthening aerobic exercise on your to-do list!<br><br>You're wired, but sitting at the computer can spread your hips, so keep exercising! Search the Internet for any health-oriented information you need. Since you are so into electronics, exercise videotapes will allow you the flexibility you want to work out on your own schedule. Anything routine or consistent drives you nuts, so fight the inevitable boredom by having lots of different tapes.<br><br>You tend to concentrate hard on you're doing, but you can become so immersed, you forget to eat balanced meals. You're an inveterate eat-on-the run snacker--try to plan ahead. You like anything unusual or exotic. So start with beautiful imported fruits from tropical islands! Just chop up a pineapple and a banana, throw them on a cookie sheet and into the freezer. Yummy to munch on during C-Span.<br><br>Keeping current is important to you, so I know you will investigate new trends in diet, nutrition and exercise. Use common sense. If a new diet, herbal remedy, or exercise idea sounds too good to be true, it probably is! Forget the fads.<br><br>Aquarius is a very social sign and you tend to do your best work in groups. You can't stand the solitary loneliness of puffing endlessly away on your basement stair master, or anything else that shuts you away from the world. Do things that will bring you in contact with others, because being around other people energizes you. I know one Aquarius who loves his Japanese martial arts classes for just this reason! So this year, why not organize a workout group? If you pool resources with co-workers or pals you may be able to hire a top-notch trainer for a twice-a-week class. You'll enjoy seeing friends while you get fit!<br><br><strong>Your Biggest Asset:</strong><br>You are always light years ahead of the wave. What you're into now, the rest of the population discovers in three years.<br><br><strong>What Drives You Crazy:</strong><br>Routine. You want to do things when the spirit moves you, no matter what time it is. This relates to eating, exercising, even making love. You would never be able to live with any kind of schedule. You probably don't own a watch--nothing important starts without you! Keep things a varied--you'll soon lose interest with the "same old, same old"!<br><br><strong>Health Risks:</strong><br>Too much inactivity because you are sitting at the computer all day. Getting lost in what you are doing and forgetting about the gym. Every take-out restaurant in the tri-state area.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fitness for Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</span></strong><br><br><strong>Your Ruling Planet:</strong>Neptune, the planet governing dance, dreams, and meditation. Ancient astrologers also believed Pisces had a co-ruler: the happy, optimistic planet Jupiter.<br><br><strong>The Part Of The Body Your Sign Rules:</strong><br>Pisces rules the feet.<br><br><strong>Your Metabolism:</strong><br>Low<br><br><strong>Your Health Profile:</strong><br>Modern-day culture's emphasis on a slim, fit body is a bit odd for Pisces, who often lives so fully in their imagination. Your mind is so active that sometimes you're a little shocked to remember you have a body you have to care for. When you are in one of your intense, creative modes, you can be light-years away from your physical self. But this doesn't have to be a problem: try one of the new virtual reality workout programs: they're new, and you can use your rich imagination to keep you motivated!<br><br>If you want to lose weight, again, give yourself a goal you can visualize in your mind: put a Polaroid of the way you look now or a photo of someone who's physique you admire up on the fridge (over the ice cream!) Pisces are masters of creative visualization--use this to your advantage!<br><br>Pisces isn't interested in exercise for exercise's sake. Thumping along in silent misery is pointless! To keep you interested, you'll want an additional payoff, like lively, rhythmic music (your sign rules music and dance), or good-looking workout clothes that make you feel sexy instead of dumpy (your sign is also highly visual.) So for all you Pisces who must exercise solo: stick a tape of Sergeant Pepper or Carmen in the boom box and sing along while you chug away on the stairmaster, treadmill or rowing machine.<br><br>Your sign has a heightened sensuality, so whatever you do for your body has to "feel good." This is one reason Pisces overeat. They fall in love with the tastes of the food and forget they are no longer hungry. Treat yourself to a sensuous aromatherapy massage after a workout, or buy some good body products to enjoy in the shower. Don't forget to bring your radio or CD player with earphones to the gym.<br><br>Swimming, ice skating, canoeing, rowing, water skiing, surfing might appeal to the Fish, as could aqua-aerobics classes. Hate water? Run along a pretty beach. Be sure your shoes that fit properly because Pisces' feet is their weakest part of their body. Shoe sizes change over time, even years after we've "grown up"! Step aerobic classes could also be a good bet. Since Pisces is the ruler of the feet, try ballet, jazz or other type of dance as a natural way to work out--but remember, if you feel pain you may have to decide between your natural ability and your natural vulnerability.<br><br>Always helpful to others, caring Pisces absorbs other's feelings like a sponge, and negativity can wear you down. You need time alone to center yourself. Exercise could become your most precious time for yourself. The quiet, meditative qualities of yoga could appeal to Fish. Pisces is also interested in all things from the Orient, including Tai chi.<br><br>Because your ruler Neptune also governs drugs, you could experience confusion about the side effects of various medicines. Ask first before you take anything new. Water retention is a problem for Pisces, and since most Fish love salt, the problem only gets worse. Avoid alcohol in excess too because it will dehydrate you.<br><br><strong>Your Biggest Asset:</strong><br>Amazing grace and coordination with almost no puffed-up vanity because of it. Enjoy!<br><br><strong>What Drives You Crazy:</strong><br>You don't like having people watch you exercise--especially if they then critique your performance. You want privacy. Allow instruction and guidance from your coach or personal trainer, but tell your friends to hold their two cents.<br><br><strong>Health Risks:</strong><br>An occasional lack of self-discipline can fall in the way of your fitness program or healthful diet. Also, don't let lack of confidence stop you from trying something new. Everyone looks silly sometimes--who cares? If you doubt me, check out professional athletes and dancers--they miss, slice, strikeout, fall and fumble all the time in their quest for perfection!</div>

Keep your heart healthy and fit with good nutrition and frequent aerobic exercise. You're happiest in a social setting, so don't work out alone. Join a health club or exercise class to get the best results. Leo loves music too, so you probably would like to work out to lively music. Lionesses especially love to move to music, so try going out dancing, maybe to a techno rave or a salsa club. Male Leos like macho, commanding sports, so if you're king of the beasts get in touch with your animal nature by learning how to kickbox!<br><br>You will love the attentions of your own personal trainer, and be insured of great results! Anything tailored just to your needs and tastes will give you support and confidence--and a chance to achieve your personal best. Note this also applies to coaches: for sports like tennis and golf.<br><br>Leo needs exercise that strengthens his or her spine and back. Leo also needs to maintain agility. Power walking could be useful on both counts as well as Pilates, Yoga or calisthenics classes. Since your sign adores fun and games, hit the park for strenuous athletic fun, such as basketball, or organize a softball team. Sign up to compete on a regular basis--it won't feel like a regimen this way. Leo doesn't like to be in a routine rut. When you travel, pick warm climates. Leos as a rule don't like to feel cold or clammy.<br><br>In terms of eating, you don't like to fuss too much, unless you're putting on a lavish spread for company. Your favorite way of handling dinner is to order out or go to a restaurant to eat, because you enjoy being served. Collect takeout menus of places that have healthful, low-fat meals. This will help you avoid falling into the fast-food trap. All those tacos will create havoc with your sleek, muscular, leonine form! Like Libra, Leo likes to party, but too much alcohol and frequent late hours will drag you down quickly. Learn when you need to say when.<br><br><strong>Your Biggest Asset:</strong><br>Looking good. Face it: vanity is your most powerful motivation.<br><br><strong>What Drives You Crazy:</strong><br>Working out anywhere that's too cold is not good (after all, you are ruled by the Sun!), whether it is indoors or out. Forget skiing (snow is not usually your "thing"), hockey or figure skating. Instead go rollerblading, biking, or horseback riding out on the open range! Also, sitting in a windowless cubicle for too long without a break will make you out of sorts. Especially in winter, be sure you get your daily dose of sunshine to combat the blues.<br><br><strong>Health Risks:</strong><br>Your enthusiasm peaks quickly and sometimes cannot be sustained. Avoid burnout by commiting to a varied program of cross-training to insure you're always doing something you like.[/b]</blockquote>cannot get anymore accurate than that  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
