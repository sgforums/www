            <div class='col-md body'>got another 1<br><br>A newlywed couple had only been married for two weeks. The husband,<br><br>although very much in love, couldn't wait to go out on the town and<br><br>party with his old buddies. So, he said to his new wife, "Honey, I'll<br><br>be right back."<br><br>"Where are you going, coochy cooh?" asked the wife.<br><br>"I'm going to the bar, pretty face. I'm going to have a beer."<br><br>The wife said, "You want a beer, my love?" She opened the door to the<br><br>refrigerator and showed him 25 different kinds of beer, brands from 12<br><br>different countries: Germany, Holland, Japan, India, etc.<br><br>The husband didn't know what to do, and the only thing that he could<br><br>Think of saying was, "Yes, lolly pop...but at the bar...you know... they have<br><br>frozen glasses..."<br><br>He didn't get to finish the sentence, because the wife interrupted him<br><br>By saying, "You want a frozen glass, puppy face?" She took a huge beer mug<br><br>out of the freezer, so frozen that she was getting chills just holding it.<br><br>The husband, looking a bit pale, said, "Yes, tootsie roll, but at the<br><br>bar they have those hors d'oeuvres that are really delicious... I won't<br><br>be long, I'll be right back. I promise. OK?"<br><br>You want hors d'oeuvres, poochi pooh?"

            <div class='col-md body'>got 1 on affairs....<br><br>The First Affair<br>A married man was having an affair with his secretary.<br>One day, their passions overcame them and they took off for her house,where they made passionate love all afternoon. Exhausted from the wild sex, they fell asleep, awakening around 8:00 p.m.<br>As the man threw on his clothes, he told the woman to take his shoes outside and rub them through the grass and dirt.<br>Mystified, she nonetheless complied. He slipped into his shoes and drove home.<br>"Where have you been?" demanded his wife when he entered the house.<br>"Darling, I can't lie to you. I've been having an affair with my secretary and we've been having sex all afternoon. I fell asleep and didn't wake up until eight o'clock."<br><br>The wife glanced down at his shoes and said, "You lying bastard!<br>You've been playing golf!".<br><br>The Second Affair<br>There was a middle-aged couple that had two stunningly beautiful teenage daughters. The couple decided to try one last time for the son they always wanted.<br><br>After months of trying, the wife finally got pregnant and sure enough, delivered a healthy baby boy nine months later.<br>The joyful father rushed into the nursery to see his new son.<br>He took one look and was horrified to see the ugliest child he had ever seen. He went to his wife and told her there was no way he could be the father of that child.<br><br>"Look at the two beautiful daughters I fathered!"<br>Then he gave her a stern look and asked, "Have you been fooling around on me?"<br>The wife just smiled sweetly and said, "Not this time!"<br><br>The Third Affair<br>A mortician was working late one night. It was his job to examine the dead bodies before they were sent off to be buried or cremated.<br><br>As he examined the body of Mr. Schwartz, who was about to be cremated, he noticed the size of his manhood.<br>I'm sorry, Mr. Schwartz", said the mortician, "but I can't send you off to be cremated with a tremendously huge private part like this. It has to be saved for posterity."<br><br>With that, the mortician used his tools to remove the dead man's private bit. He stuffed his prize into a briefcase and took it home.<br><br>The first person he showed it to was his wife. "I have something to show you that you won't believe," he said, and opened up his briefcase.<br><br>"Oh my God!" the wife screamed, "Schwartz is dead!"<br><br>Fourth Affair<br>A woman was in bed with her lover when she heard her husband opening the front door.<br>"Hurry," she said, "stand in the corner." Then she quickly rubbed baby oil all over him and then dusted him with talcum powder.<br><br>"Don't move until I tell you to," she whispered.<br>"Just pretend you're a statue."<br>"What's this, honey?" the husband inquired as he entered the room.<br>"Oh, it's a statue," she replied nonchalantly. "The Smiths bought one for their bedroom. I liked it so much, I got one for us too."<br><br>No more was said about the statue, not even later when they went to sleep. Around two in the morning, the husband got out of bed, went to the kitchen and returned a while later with a sandwich and a glass of milk.<br><br>"Here," he said to the statue, "eat something. I stood like an idiot at the Smiths for three days and nobody offered me as much as a glass of water."<br><br>The Fifth Affair<br>A man walks into a nightclub one night. He goes up to the bar and asks for a beer. "Certainly, Sir, that'll be 1 cent."<br><br>"One Cent?", exclaimed the man. The bartender<br>replied, "Yes."<br>So the man glances over at the menu and asks, "Could I have a nice juicy T-bone steak, with chips, peas and a fried egg?"<br><br>"Certainly Sir," replies the barman, "but that comes to real money. A whole 4 cents."<br>"Four Cents?", exclaimed the man. "Where's the guy who owns this place?" The bartender replied, "Upstairs, with my wife."<br><br>The man says, "What's he doing upstairs with your wife?"<br>The bartender replied, "The same thing as I'm doing to his business."<br><br>The Sixth Affair<br>Jake was dying. His wife, Becky, was maintaining a candlelight vigil by his side. She held his fragile hand, tears running down her face.<br><br>Her praying roused him from his slumber. He looked up and his pale lip began to move slightly.<br>"Becky my darling," he whispered. "Hush my love," she said. "Rest, don't talk." He was insistent. "Becky," he said in his tired voice,<br><br>I have something that I must confess."<br>"There's nothing to confess," replied the weeping Becky, "everything's all right, go to sleep."<br>"No, no. I must die in peace, Becky. I .... I slept with your sister, your best friend, her best friend and even your mother!"<br><br>"I know, my sweet one" whispered Becky, "that's why I poisoned you."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ex-girlfriend<br><br>A guy runs into his ex-girlfriend at a bar. “I had sex with another woman last night,” he tells her. “But I was thinking of you the whole time.” “You miss me that much?” she asks. “No,” he says. “But it kept me from coming too fast.”<br><br>Meat Department<br><br>A man approaches a beautiful woman in a supermarket. “I’ve lost my girlfriend,” he tells her. “Can you stand here and talk to me for a few minutes?” “Sure, but I don’t understand how that would help,” she replies. “Well, every time I talk to a woman with tits like yours, my girlfriend appears out of nowhere.”<br><br>Early Stages of Viagra Development<br><br>A man having trouble achieving an erection decides to consult a witch doctor. The witch doctor throws some herbs on a fire, shakes his rattle, and says, “I have placed a powerful spell on you, but it will only work once a year. Just say ‘one, two, three’ and you’ll get the largest erection you’ve ever had. After your wife’s been satisfied, simply say ‘one, two, three, four’ and it will disappear for 12 months.” Later that night as the man is lying in bed watching television, he says to his wife, “Watch this! One, two, three!” His schlong becomes larger and stiffer than ever before. His wife is amazed. She smiles and says, “That’s great! But what did you say ‘one, two, three’ for?”<br><br>Bubba Hump<br><br>A football coach noticed that his star tackle, Bubba, had so many women hanging around that he couldn’t possibly handle all of them. So one day he asked Bubba, “Just what the hell is your secret?” Bubba replied, “Well, coach, whenever I’m about to have sex, I always whip it out and bang it on the dresser like a hammer. That numbs it and I can screw ’em forever!” The coach went home early that day and went straight to the bedroom. He heard his wife in the shower and, seeing a window of opportunity, tore off his clothes and started banging his penis on the dresser. His wife immediately stuck her head out of the shower and said, “Is that you, Bubba?”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Little Johnny came home from school to see the families pet rooster dead in the front yard. Rigormortis had set in and it was flat on its back with its legs in the air. When his Dad came home Johnny said, "Dad our roosters dead and his legs are sticking in the air. Why is his legs sticking in the air?"<br><br>His father thinking quickly said, "Son, that's so God can reach down from the clouds and lift the rooster straight up to heaven."<br><br>"Gee Dad that's great," said little Johnny. A few days later, when Dad came home from work, Johnny rushed out to meet him yelling, "Dad, Dad we almost lost Mom today!"<br><br>"What do you mean?" said Dad.<br><br>"Well Dad, I got home from school early today and went up to your bedroom and there was Mom flat on her back with her legs in the air screaming, "Jesus I'm coming, I'm coming" If it hadn't of been for Uncle George holding her down we'd have lost her for sure!"<br><br>A hippie gets onto a bus and sits next to a nun in the front seat. The hippie looks over and asks the nun if she would have sex with him. The nun surprised by the question politely declines and gets off the bus at the next stop. When the bus starts on it's way the driver says to the hippie, "I can tell you how you can get that nun to have sex with you". The hippie says that he'd love to know, so the bus driver tells him that every Tuesday evening at midnight the nun goes to the cemetery and pray's to God. If you went dressed in a robe and glow in the dark paint mask she would think you are god and you could command her to have sex with you. The hippie decides this is a great idea, so on Tuesday he goes to the cemetery and waits for the nun to show up. At midnight sure enough the nun showed up, while she was in the middle of praying the hippie jumped out from hiding and says. "I AM GOD" I have heard your prayers and I will answer them BUT ... first you must have sex with me. The nun agrees but asks for anal sex so she might keep her virginity because she is married to the church. The hippie agrees to this and has his way with the nun. After the hippie finishes he stands up and rips off the mask and shouts "Ha, Ha Ha I'm the hippie!!" Then the nun jumps up and shouts "Ha Ha Ha I'm the bus driver!!"<br><br>One day in class the teacher brought a bag full of fruit. "Now class, I'm going to reach into the bag and describe a piece of fruit, and you tell what fruit I'm talking about. Okay, first: it's round, plumb and red." Of course, Johnny raised his hand high, but the teacher, wisely ignored him and picked Deborah, who promptly answered "An apple." The teacher replied, "No Deborah, it's a beet, but I like your thinking." Now for the second. It's soft, fuzzy,and colored red and brownish." Well, Johnny is hopping up and down in his seat trying to get the teacher to call on him. But she skips him again and calls on Billy. "Is it a peach?" Billy asks. "No, Billy, I'm afraid it's a potato. But I like your thinking," the teacher replys. Here's another: it's long, yellow, and fairly hard." By now Johnny is about to explode as he waves his hand frantically. The teacher skips him again and calls on Sally. "A banana," she says. "No," the teacher replies, "it's a squash, but I like your thinking." Johnny is kind of irritated now, so he speaks up loudly. "Hey, I've got one for you teacher; let me put my hand in my pocket. Okay, I've got it: it's round, hard, and it got a head on it." "Johnny!" she cries. "That's disgusting!" "Nope," answers Johnny, "it's a quarter, but I like your thinking!"<br><br>Johnny was 8 years old and like other boys his age rather curious. He had been hearing quite a bit about 'courting' from the older boys, and he wondered what it was and how it was done. One day he took his question to his mother, who became rather flustered.<br><br>Instead of explaining things to Johnny, she told him to hide behind the curtains one night and watch his older sister and her boyfriend. This he did. The following morning, Johnny described EVERYTHING to his mother. "Sis and her boyfriend sat and talked for a while, then he started kissing and hugging herI figured 'Sis must be getting sickbecause her face started looking funny. He must have thought so too, because he put his hand inside her blouse to feel her heart, just &gt; the way the doctor would. Except he's not as smart as the docotr because he seemed to have trouble finding her heart. I guess he was getting sick too, because pretty soon both of them started panting and getting all out of breath. His other hand must have been cold because he put it under her skirt. About this time 'Sis got worse and began to moan and sigh and squirm around and slide down toward the end of the couch. This was when her fever started. I knew it was a fever, because Sis told him she felt really hot. Finally, I found out what was making them so sick -- a big eel had gotten inside his pants somehow. It just jumped out of his pants and stood there, about 10 inches long, honest, anyway he grabbed it in one hand to keep it from getting away. When Sis saw it, she got really scared -- her eyes got big, and her mouth fell open, and she started calling out to God and stuff like that. She said it was the biggest one she's ever seen; I should tell her about the ones down at the lake by our house! Anyway, Sis got brave and tried to kill the eel by biting its head off. All of a sudden she grabbed it with both hands and held it tight while he took a muzzle out of his pocket and slipped it over the eel's head to keep it from biting again. Sis lay back and spread her legs so she could get a scissor-lock on it and he helped by lying on top of the eel. The eel put up a hell of a fight. Sis started groaning and squealing and her boyfriend almost upset the couch. I guess they wanted to kill the eel by squashing it between them. Her boyfriend got up, and sure enough, they killed the eel. I knew because it just hung there, limp, and some of its insides were hanging out. Sis and her boyfriend were a little tired from the battle, but they went back to courting anyway. He started hugging and kissing her again. By golly, the eel wasn't dead! It jumped straight up and started to fight again. I guess eels are like cats -- they have nine lives or something. This time, Sis jumped up and tried to kill it by sitting on it. After about a 35 minute struggle, they finally killed the eel. I knew it was dead, because I saw Sis's boyfriend peel its skin off and flush it down the toilet.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There was once a kid who overheard his parents screwing. His father told his mother,"Oh, you have such nice big titties!"<br>His mother told his father,"Oh, you have such a big, long cock!" He asked his dad what titties and cocks were. His dad Told him,"Titties are big hats that women wear, and cocks are big long coats that men wear." The next day, he overhears his parents arguing. His dad calls his mom a bitch and his mom calls his dad a bastard. He asks his mom what a bitch and bastard are. His mom tells him,"Well, a bitch is a woman and a bastard is a man." It's the night of the thanksgiving dinner. He walks by the bathroom while his dad is shaving. His dad cuts himself and says,"Shit!" He asks what shit is. "Oh, it's just this stuff I'm getting off my face now." He then walks into the kitchen, where his mom is stuffing the turkey. She slices her finger with a knife and says,"Fuck!" He asks what fuck is. She tells him,"It's what I'm putting in the turkey." The guests arrive,and the kid wants to show off His new vocabulary. "Hi, there, bitches and bastards. Allow me to take your titties and cocks and hang them up for you. My daddy's in the batroom wiping the shit off his face and my mommy's in the kitchen fucking the turkey."<br><br>It got crowded in heaven, so, for one day it was decided only to accept people who had really had a bad day on the day they died. St. Peter was standing at the pearly gates and said to the first man, "Tell me about the day you died."<br><br>The man said, "Oh, it was awful. I was sure my wife was having an affair, so I came home early to catch her with him. I searched all over the apartment but couldn't find him anywhere. So I went out onto the balcony, we live on the 25th floor, and found this man hanging over the edge by his fingertips. I went inside, got a hammer, and started hitting his hands. He fell, but landed in some bushes. So, I got the refrigerator and pushed it over the balcony and it crushed him. The strain of the act gave me a heart attack, and I died."<br><br>St. Peter couldn't deny that this was a pretty bad day, and since it was a crime of passion, he let the man in.<br><br>He then asked the next man in line about the day he died. "Well, sir, it was awful," said the second man. "I was doing aerobics on the balcony of my 26th floor apartement when I twisted my ankle and slipped over the edge. I managed to grab the balcony of the apartment below, but some maniac came out and started pounding on my fingers with a hammer. Luckily I landed in some bushes. But, then the guy dropped a refrigerator on me!"<br><br>St. Peter chuckled, let him into heaven and decided he could really start to enjoy this job.<br><br>"Tell me about the day you died?", he said to the third man in line.<br><br>"OK, picture this, I'm naked, hiding inside a refrigerator...."</div>
