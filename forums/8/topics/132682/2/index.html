He is supported by a recent study conducted by Columbia films for an Indian Film production house that found effective scheduling and organised finances could bring down the cost of making a film by almost eight per cent.<br><br>In addition, the family-owned production houses also need to be tightened in market terms, for the industry to be more professionally managed. In any case the films they made managed to gross $2.2 million in the US and more than US $2.7 million in UK.<br><br>Former Miss World turned actor Aishwarya Rai, who recently completed shooting for the much-waited international project Bride And Prejudice says India's image in the global world is rising but "Indian films will have to meet international standards to face global competition."<br><br>Even veteran director Ghai is getting into the grove. During the Cannes Film Festival, he was quoted as saying that for the first time in his career he had to develop a bound script prior to shooting for his international project Kisna  that has English and Hindi versions with Vivek Oberoi and Antonia Bernath.<br><br>Hopefully, once Bollywood gets it act together we will be debating on another type of  outsourcing - made in India films marketed across the world.<br></div>
