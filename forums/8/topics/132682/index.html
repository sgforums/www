Even it is  the trailer and quality above is coming from a industry biased for dancing around trees. What does it tell u?<br><br>Promo Watch: Dus<br><br>By Gaurav Malani (IndiaFM News Bureau), May 14th, 2005 - 0930 hrs IST<br><br>Cast: Sanjay Dutt, Suniel Shetty, Abhishek Bachchan, Zayed Khan, Shilpa Shetty, Esha Deol, Dia Mirza, Raima Sen, Pankaj Kapur, Jawed Sheikh and Gulshan Grover.<br><br>Trailer duration: 60 seconds<br><br>10 characters<br>10-day mission<br>That's Anubhav Sinha's Dus (meaning Ten) for you…<br><br>And then there are also 10 excuses in the form of the title track of the film - Dus Bahane that opens the first promo of Dus. A peppy and energetic number that's sure to rock the musical charts in the coming weeks!

Racing cars, firing guns, aerial rope stunts follows. Seems like the audience will have a blast!<br><br>Zayed who croons the disco number exudes a youthful charm. Abhishek Bachchan accompanies Zayed in the track and comes up with some drolly dance steps. Esha Deol sports a new chic hairdo. Shilpa Shetty, as the member of an Anti Terrorist Cell radiates more attitude than glamour. The promo ends with the men in black - Sanjay Dutt, Suniel Shetty, Abhishek Bachchan and Zayed Khan dressed in black suits - prowling ahead ala the Kaante style.<br><br>Produced by Nitin Manmohan and Sohail Maklai, Dus is an intriguing thriller on world terrorism about 10 characters on a 10-day mission. The film extensively shot in Canada and Mumbai is not inspired by any foreign flick. Anubhav Sinha who earlier directed a love story (Tum Bin) and a comedy (Aapko Pehle Bhi Kahin Dekha Hain) changes gears to a new genre of a mutli-starrer action thriller with Dus.<br><br>The Deadly Dus Characters<br><br>Sanjay Dutt - Chief of the Anti Terrorist Cell.<br>Suniel Shetty - American cop.<br>Abhishek Bachchan, Shilpa Shetty and Zayed Khan - Members of the Anti Terrorist Cell.<br>Esha Deol - Abhishek's love interest in Canada.

It made life a lot simpler and we were able to get things done a lot faster," Sippy said.<br><br><a href="http://www.spacedaily.com/2003/030822124417.2qxcdo4k.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.spacedaily.com/2003/030822124417.2qxcdo4k.html</a><br><br>I told u before.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>India Daily</strong><br><br>Bollywood still not a global brand<br>Apr. 5, 2005<br><br>The Indian film industry would have to sharpen its film making skills, plod out from the wave of mediocrity and harness all its energies towards making films rooted-in-the soil but with a universal appeal for Bollywood to become a global brand, according to film experts. "We have to get out of making mediocre films and stop indulging in this mutual complimenting game if we have to make that cutting edge on the Indian scenario," said Vidhoo Vinod Chopra in a candid statement during a presentation on "Bollywood brand going global: a myth or a reality", at ''Frames'', a convention organised by FICCI. Making a hard hitting statement, Chopra said that Indian film makers should stop painting a rosy picture of the Indian film scenario going global because the revenue figures generated by Indian films abroad spoke a different story when it was compared to Hollywood films.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Bollywood branding: Still a long way to go! </strong><br><br>Indiantelevision.com Team<br><br>(5 April 2005 6:00 pm)<br><br>MUMBAI: Has Bollywood gone global? And has the journey at least begun? Or is it just plain hype, merely a myth? That it is a myth was demonstrated by Ramesh Sippy, Govind Nihalani and most of all, Vidhu Vinod Chopra at a debate 'Branding Bollywood Going Global-Myth and Reality?' which saw major fireworks at the FICCI Frames today.<br><br>Karan Johar, also on the speakers' panel, tried his best to prove that Bollywood has gone global, but to no avail.<br><br>The session was moderated by UTV's Founder Chairman, Ronnie Screwvala. The 29-year old Johar kicked off the session with a telling remark. "Shekhar Kapur, Deepa Mehta and Mira Nair are our ambassadors. If we continue to make films with honesty we can grab an international audience for our films," he said.<br><br>Kacon Sethi, CEO, K Sera Sera Production Ltd, endorsed Johar's views. At this, Govind Nihalani turned the tide and said, "I wish we could sell all our films as we make them per se. We are told to modify our movies to suit the market tastes overseas. How does one ascertain what and how to modify in the films? The whole product should sell, which more often than not, does not do so."<br><br>"Why are we only aiming for the UK market? We are still not looking towards even the US. And what about the other virgin territories?" he added.<br><br>Vidhu Vinod Chopra, who clearly stole the show with his candid remarks, felt that Bollywood's journey onto the global arena had not even begun yet. Though he didn't say it openly, he clearly hinted that one or two films from the Yash Chopra and Karan Johar camp amassing good collections abroad is not the yardstick to for celebrations.<br><br>"Why are we celebrating? Look at the figures which Harry Potter films generate. In contrast, our films, even in terms of the prints released, are way behind. Harry Potter and some other foreign flicks have released 25,000 prints. Our highest prints are not more than 1,000 per film, the average being just about 300-600," he pointed out.<br><br>"Tell me five filmmakers who can make global cinema," he asked. At the end of the session, the general sentiment of the audience was that all three aspects of filmmaking-distribution, marketing and content-have to improve.<br><br>Indian cinema is still a small blip on the global scene and is a story waiting to be told worldwide.<br><br></div>

And u change topic huh? DOnt tell me your chinese movie dont have music and songs .Read this shocking news :<br><br><strong>Farah Khan is going places internationally.<br><br>After choreographing Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Bombay Dreams, she is now dancing her way Eastwards.<br><br>Khan has been approached by Hollywood producer Andre Morgan (he is Bruce Lee’s agent and has produced films like Enter The Dragon, Return Of The Dragon, The Godfather, and more recently, Million Dollar Baby) to choreograph the Chinese musical, Perhaps Love.<br><br>The film is directed by Peter Chan and stars Andy Lao, who will be play the narrator of the story.<br><br>Perhaps Love is an epic love story spanning almost 30 years and is based around the experiences of a film crew.<br><br>Khan says, “I will be going with a 10-member team of choreographers and shooting the film at a stretch.” Will the dances be in Bollywood style? “Oh no!” she disclaims.<br><br>“The music is quite different from ours, with a three and a five beat, so I will be adopting a style of my own, something specific.”<br><br>Jaiveer Panwar, Vice President, Showdiff Worldwide, an event management company, roped in Khan for the film. “The producer said they were looking for Indian choreographers.<br><br>They met a few choreographers here, but when Peter Chan met Farah and saw her work, they felt she was the best person to do the film. They were amazed at how she could put together her songs so quickly, particularly, Chaiyya Chaiyya.”<br><br>Adds Khan, “They particularly loved the song Yeh Fizayen in Main Hoon Naa.<br><br>Perhaps Love will be shot in Shanghai in a 50-day schedule. “I have to learn the art of shooting a big film in 50 days from them,” smiles Khan. “I will be shooting four to five songs in 10 days.”<br><br>Panwar has great hopes for her. “International producers and directors are looking towards the Indian market for more work. It is only a matter of time before Farah signs a Hollywood film. People are already in discussions in this regard.”</strong><br><br><a href="http://in.nri.yahoo.com/050409/156/2knao.html" rel="nofollow">http://in.nri.yahoo.com/050409/156/2knao.html</a></div>
