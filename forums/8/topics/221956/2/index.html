There are different bachelor degrees like science , law, medicine/health sciences , engineering, business etc .<br><br>International schools are not about a million dollars per year though. I don't think they are that expensive . Public schools are reasonable priced for citizens and permanent residents (PR) til University level . However it comes with a snag for Singapore- if you have a son and you are a pr ....and you want to benefit from reasonably priced schooling ....your son will have to do national service . For foreigners I think for secondary school fees  aka High School - it's around hundreds per month depending on which school.<br><br>I don't see many people make it with a single art degree , let alone a business degree unless it is from Cambridge , Oxford or the Ivy League or they are some scholar . If you are not from those elite universities recognised by the Singaporean government, don't expect it to be easy to find a job . There are a lot of locals with art degrees as well .</div>

It can and does happen in Africa though. Oh and some people mentioned FT. What is FT?</div></blockquote>You are lost my son. May god have mercy on your soul. (Coincidentally, Singapire is a souless country. Hmmmm...)<br><br>You have highlighted some of teh good points about Singapore in your post above, and as you have gathered, I was kidding (but only just).<br><br>Some points to put things into perspective:<br><br>- <strong>Education</strong> in Singapore is a soulless and very unpleasant experience. When you child enters school, he hits the ground running and he is expected to keep running for at least 12 years. He will be indoctrinated to think that success and happiness is a high salary and a high powered job (can't blame them as in Singapore there is not safety net. You have no money, you starve). He will be taught that there is only one way to go in life: get good results, get a career, get money, acheive self-worth. After he comes out of Junior College or Polytechnic, he will be like the vast majority of Singaporean Youths out there - proficient at rote-learning, highly ignorant and slightly fearful of the world outside Singapore.<br><br>- <strong> Raising a Family</strong>. Are you sure Singapore is the best place to raise a family? You son will have to do Natiojnal Service. I know you many Americans have a fetish for all things military but believe me, National Service is a tremendous sacrifice. For one, NS is dangerous for a person's well-being both physically and mentally. I do not claim to have had a very tough time in the Army but I have seen at least 2 persons driven quite mad by the army. One of them even tried suicide. The army is not for everyone and not everyone comes out with all parts intact. For all this, and a lime time of bondage to the nation, you son will get nothing in return. A company, if he can get away with it, will naturally prefer foreigners. This coupled with the 'free-market' ethos of the Singapore Govt means that this is a country where citizens are in a position that is not better than foreigners.<br><br>- <strong>Security</strong>. Yes Singapore is safe. But really, it is overrated. I've lived in England for several years whilst at university and I came through it unmolested. All that is needed to remove this advantage of Singapore's is a little commonsense. Furthermore, I wasn't joking when I said that Singapore is a sinking ship. There are more and more foreigners around in Singapore today, the result of an attempt by the govt to halt the ageing of the population. For some reason, most of these foreigners are from China...and these people are not brought up to obey laws like Singaporeans are. If you've had any contact with the CHinese, one thing you will realise is that they are very devious ppl - they want something and they will devise all sorts of schemes to get it, the law be damned. That is in their psyche and I suppose they are a product of hard times. Hence, the security situation in SIngapore can only worsen.<br><br>- <strong>Job Opportunities</strong>. If you can get a job with your histroy degree, fine. However, I doubt it would be a high-paying job. If you've got experience you could perhaps be a lecturer. They earn a decent salary.<br><br>-<strong>quality of life</strong>. The Singaporean quality of life is, in a word, mediocre. Housing is very expensive, Cars are very expensive, and the public transport system, while reliable, is always crowded. There is not safety net in the form of unemplyoment benefits or minimum wage so if you lose your job, you have no savings and you have no familiy to bail you out, you are pretty much on your own.<br><br>Another point is this: the fact that I, a Singaporean, am trying so hard to dissuade you from settling in Singapore must surely ring alarm bells for you. Take alook at some of the topics that crop up here and you will realize I am not alone. Where else in the developed world will you have citizens who so abhor their country?<br><br>Go somewhere else. Really. Explore your options then decide. You could almost certainly do better than Singapore.</div>

As you pointed out, indoctrination starts with the family and kids bring these values to school. When almost everyone think like this, then it is very likely that a child will be so influenced.<br><br>You say that this phenomenon is common in the west, I can tell you that is not true. To be more explicit, the level of indoctrination is not as strong as in Singapore. In most western countries, people recognise that life is not solely about your paycheck.</div>

Singapore appears to be an electronics and science/math nation. These are the types of jobs I could get in America: <a href="http://www.historians.org/pubs/Free/careers/" rel="nofollow">http://www.historians.org/pubs/Free/careers/ </a>So are these types of jobs available in Singapore? Thanks in advance.</div></blockquote>seriously... you're going to get way less money here in S'pore... that is if you really find a job. It's going to be hard to find a job unless you are willing to work on other non history-related jobs like teaching English.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>Oh I'm keeping my options open although I am intrigued by Singapore because it is a bit exotic to me. Italy would be also. I'm so bored hear in NYC. I know I need to work first in America and on the low levels before I could go overseas to Asia or Europe. I at least hope to visit Singapore someday. I'm glad people are telling it like it is. From what I have read about the country you people seem to be validating my beliefs about how things are. Maybe I could do some temporary work there for a year or two through some American or foreign company. You never really know what might pop up out of nowhere. As for the military service I was also aware of that and I don't mind if I have to do it. I don't if I go, at least that is what I read but I heard my kids would have to. It may or may not be for them but at least your country isn't involved in stupid conflicts all over the world like mine. I'm scared to join my military, I might end up in the Middle East (Iraq or Afghanistan) and those countries were never on my tourist list. It's true the West is not as indoctrinated as some parts of Asia in education and hard work. America is certainly declining in brain power and ambition but we still have some left. I guess I will just have to wait and see where life takes me. Hopefully I get to go to Singapore and the world over. BTW I do have and have had Chinese friends and they were/are very nice but I'm sure there are some very ambitious and deceiving ones like someone else mentioned. And someone asked if I searched through a certain website and the answer is no.<br><br>I would like to say thanks to everyone who has helped me to realize my ambitions more, which is basically everyone who posted an answer in this thread, especially for the links.</div>
