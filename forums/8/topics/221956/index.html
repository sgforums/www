And to the person who mention it I would like to do something in a museum in America. What about working in a park? We can do that with a history degree too but we may need some other classes in America. In other words a park ranger. I don't think that's very big but I'm sure some park needs safety in Singapore, plus I can ensure a good time <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> by enforcing the rules.<br></div></blockquote>Hey, I think I mistook you for a Singaporean who's studying history in NYC.
