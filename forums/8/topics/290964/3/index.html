              <p>i reeli canot stand the service at Kallang Leisure Park.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">That day my friends and I went there and we wanted to take a photo inside the mall. Then, b4 we cld successfully take a photo, a security guard came and stopped us from taking. We got irritated at him, not because he was telling us not to take a photo. Rather, it was the tone he used on us. It was as if he demeaned our very existence merely because we were teenagers. But we agreed to not take photos and he left. So we were hanging around at that area, the EMPTY corridor outside KFC where NOBODY was walking or using the walkway or anything because there were no shops at all there, to wait for our fren hu was arriving in 5 mins, as well as wait for the bowling shop owner to call us as we were on the waiting list to bowl. There was only a stretch of white, blank walls at the area we were waiting at. Then, the security guard came back and shoo-ed us away because he said that we could not linger there. When we asked him why, he would not explain to us. He just did not have valid reasons. When we explained to him that we were waiting purposefully for our fren, he insisted that we could not wait there. We were of absolutely no hindrance whatsoever to anyone at all because no one used the walkway. And the way he talked to us and looked at us was very demeaning as if he had no respect at all for us. He was rude, arrogant and was totally out of his line. I was so fuming mad at him. Btw, he is of average height, dark-skinned and has curly hair. Please beware when you see him. </span></p>
