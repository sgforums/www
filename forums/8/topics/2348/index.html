            <div class='col-md body'>when i was a bmtc pc back in ns quite common for my recs come for interview with sad face and say gf wanna break up. almost all the time its coz girl frustated cannot see the bf as frequently as before.<br>its hard to counsel these recs. to those of you reading and might be like this, i will say wat i always tell those recs:<br>we are here not becoz we dont love them, but it is precisely becoz we love them that we do wat we have to do. we suffer so that they and all our loved ones can all sleep in peace at night. perhaps they dont understand, but all you can do is try to explain and hope it will work out. if it doesn't, than all that is left is for you to be strong and fight on, and have faith that you will one day find a love worthy of the sacrifice you have made'.<br>honestly these were my words to them, and as in back then, i say them again now with utmost sincerity and i will appreciate it if you guys do not reply to my post by slamming ns.<br><br>------------------<br>RockerZ!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the phrase should be<br><br><blockquote><br>we are here not becoz we love them, but it is precisely becoz we are forced to do wat we have to do. we suffer so that "THEY" can all sleep in peace at night. perhaps we dont understand, but all "YOU" can do is try to explain and hope it will work out. if it doesn't, anyway you still have to be strong and fight on unless you want to end up in DB.<br></blockquote>Face the fact lar.
