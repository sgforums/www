Let me donate my Anger to You, for the Charity of Me!"<br><br>Come on guys, the least you can do to help make these pathetic pieces of sh*t feel useful is to use them as target practice and for destressing.<br><br>Remember to say thank you.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
