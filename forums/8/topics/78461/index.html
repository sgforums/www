With their abilities and your proper education plus experience, you will be way ahead of them, unless you're having bad luck.<br><br>IMO, I suggest start with a professional certification or diploma or degree in management (the main dish), take up side certs in accounting, finance and business law (sides) AND a technical cert (deserts) to start with. Look for seminars held by SGX(appeitizers) in investments, I think they are rather useful, got dragged by a friend there but it was me who learnt the stuff. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> And get some experience in the whatever area you want to develop in, even a small office boy in the building will learn more than someone studying it in the library, I guess. Never been in both shoes, so dunnoe.<br><br>If you don't have any good ideas, get a honest partner with great business ideas who needs you to fill in something, maybe he doesn't have the money, maybe he doesn't have good contacts, there must be something he is lacking and you got it. Or other way round, who knows.<br><br>Entrepreneurship certs isn't really worth it because its really a mixture of this and that, which, if you know how and have the time/dough, you can get better stuff, like mix and match DIY. Overall, you'll find yourself somewhere like my suggestion above, yet non-speciaized in anything at all. Its like a Dell comp vs. a SLS custom comp, looks good, taste bland. Of course, there is always the warrenty issue, you might not be able to finish all those courses and things, but who can you blame in the end?<br><br>The rest should depend how efficient you are able to solve the problems you will face. Anyways, I'm just an IT dude, but I'm not gonna get stuck in one place for sure. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div></blockquote>wow.........sounds like a rojak..........a  mxiture of everything.........where shall i start off first?</div>

(Truth is, I feel old, thats why. LOL.)<br><br>Just one thing must be enforced is, finish what you started.
