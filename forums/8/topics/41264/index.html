He was throwing a lot of facts and figures at me, and I wanted to follow as best I could, so I told my 6-year-old son to run and get me a pad. He came back and handed me a Kotex right in front of our guest. --- Kathy Newman, 46,Winston-Salem, NC</span><br><br><span style="color: brown;">I was taking a shower when my 2-year-old son came into the bathroom and wrapped himself in toilet paper. Although he made a mess, he looked adorable, so I ran fo! r my camera and took a few shots. They came out so well that I had copies made and included one with each of our Christmas cards. Days later, a relative called about the picture, laughing hysterically, and suggesting I take a closer look. Puzzled, I stared at the photo and was shocked to discover that in addition to my son, I had<br>captured my reflection in the mirror wearing nothing but a camera! ---<br>anonymous</span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">I was at the golf store comparing different kinds of golf balls. I was unhappy with the women's type I had been using. After browsing for several minutes, I was approached by one of the good-looking gentlemen who works at the store. He asked if he could help me. Without thinking, I looked at him and said, "I think I like playing with men's balls." ---<br>Colleen Collins, 31, Ferndale, MI! ;</span><br><br><span style="color: green;">My sister and I were at the ! mall and passed by a store that sold a variety of nuts. As we were looking at the display case, the boy behind the counter asked if we needed any help. I replied, "No, I'm just looking at your nuts." My sister started to laugh hysterically, the boy grinned, and I turned beet-red and walked away. To this day, my sister has never lets me forget. --- Faye Emerick, 34, Ellerslie, MD</span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">While in line at the bank one afternoon, my toddler decided to release some pent-up energy and ran amok. I was finally able to grab hold of her after receiving looks of disgust and annoyance from other patrons. I told her that if she did not start behaving right now she would be punished. To my horror, she looked me in the eye and said in a voice just as threatening, "If you don't let me go right now, I will tell Grandma ! that I saw you kissing Daddy's pee-pee last night! The silence was deafening after this enlightening exchange. Even the tellers stopped what they were doing. I mustered up the last of my dignity and walked out of the bank with my daughter in tow. The last thing I heard when the<br>door closed behind me was screams of laughter. --- Amy Richardson; Stafford, VA</span><br><br><span style="color: olive;">One of the funniest, most-embarrassing-moment stories I've come upon in a long time was about a lady who picked up several items at a discount store. When she finally got up to the checker, she learned that one of her items had no price tag. Imagine her embarrassment when the checker got on the store intercom and boomed out for all the store to hear,<br>"PRICE CHECK ON LANE THIRTEEN, TAMPAX, SUPER SIZE." That was bad enough, but somebody at the re! ar of the store apparently misunderstood the word! ; Tampax for THUMBTACKS. In a business-like tone, a voice boomed back over the intercom. "DO YOU WANT THE KIND YOU PUSH IN WITH YOUR THUMB OR THE KIND YOU POUND IN WITH A HAMMER??" --- anonymous</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">A teacher noticed that a little boy at the back of the class was<br>squirming around, scratching his crotch and not paying attention. She went back to find out what was going on. He was quite embarrassed and whispered that he had just recently been circumcised and he was quite itchy. The teacher told him to go down to the principal's office. He was to phone his mother and ask her what he should do about it. He did it and returned to his class. Suddenly, there was a commotion at the back of the room. She went back to investigate only to find him sitting at his desk with his penis hanging out. "I thought I told you to call! your mom?" she screamed. "I did," he said, "And she told me that if I could stick it out till noon, she'd come and get me.</span><br><br></div>
