            <div class='col-md body'>Russians spend millions to pull pranks on friends<br>January 17, 2006 	Print Ready 	  	Email Article<br><br>WEALTHY Russians, looking for new ways to amuse themselves have started a growing trend.<br><br>They are paying huge sums to have elaborate practical jokes played on friends and associates. And they don't hesitate to use the police or pay a company to set up the hoaxes.<br><br>London's Sunday Times reported that when Mr Denis Matsuev, one of Russia's best-known pianists, turned 30 recently, his friends didn't give him a champagne party. Instead they arranged for him to be arrested.<br><br>As part of a carefully planned practical joke, Mr Matsuev was met at a Moscow railway station by real armed police, put in their van and threatened with torture.<br><br>But instead of taking him to prison, the police delivered Mr Matsuev to his friends, who had put a piano on the van so that he could play while driving around the city under police escort.<br><br>Mr Matsuev, who claims to have enjoyed his 15,000 ($43,000) birthday treat said: 'I was so scared I nearly passed out.'<br><br>Russians are paying millions of roubles for elaborate pranks organised by a company that promises to cater for the most bizarre sense of humour, the newspaper reported.<br><br>'Our clients are people with money, influence and taste,' said Mr Sergei Knyazev, whose company sets up the practical jokes. He said he was inspired by The Game, a film in which Hollywood star Michael Douglas plays a businessman whose brother pays a firm to spice up his mundane life with dramatic events.<br><br>One of the ruses in Mr Knyazev's catalogue of jokes, yet to be ordered, is called Robinson Crusoe. For 20,000 a group of up to five friends are invited on to a yacht and shipwrecked on an island with no food or shelter.<br><br>Other jokes, already used, include having 'heroin' planted in the car of an unsuspecting businessman. He was then locked in a cell for hours with actors posing as criminals and questioned by an 'investigator' who threatened him with a 15-year jail sentence.<br><br>MANIAC<br><br>The escapade cost his friends 50,000 and included a stunt in which he was tricked into believing at one point that he would receive an award from President Vladimir Putin.<br><br>Another popular prank is to invite friends to a party at an isolated Russian country house or dacha on Moscow's outskirts.<br><br>After a while the host vanishes, the phone lines are cut and the guests are locked in. For an extra fee, an actor posing as an axe-wielding maniac can break in. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
