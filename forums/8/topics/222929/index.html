            <div class='col-md body'>I am really furious over my encounter that happened at a supermarket located at Toa Payoh. My $5 dropped from my wallet and while I was about to pick it up, a woman in her late 50s-60s picked it up and proceeded to walk away. She was wearing a woman t-shirt (those with waist) and pants, and is bespectacled. I gave chase, saying that is my money. Without looking at me, she kept on walking, saying the money is hers. My voice got louder, telling her that was my money, I dropped it. The she waved her hand, shook her head and started saying loudly "young people trying to rob old woman". Then hurriedly walked away. The supermarket staff said they could not do anything. They said I should have grabbed hold of her and pulled her to them. Then they could call the police. Maybe if I did that, she would say I broke her arm? At that time, there was no security guard in sight.<br><br>The $5 could only buy me a simple food court meal. But the incident really makes me furious. Tomorrow I am going to notify the charities that I have been donating monthly, that I am withdrawing my donations. Old people do not deserve my respect and charity.</div>
