            <div class='col-md body'>KNN........got one thing i really must voice out and ask for everyone's opinions.<br><br>recently, i've been walking pass two private schools : Informatics and MDIS.<br>i notice got a lot of young students(girls and boys) from these 2 schools always dress like very very japanese one.<br>they wear those japanese-looking sweaters with hoods, and their style of fashion also got a lot of accessories here and there, and the pants also laced with lots of accessories and pieces of cloths like those in tokyo streets.<br>somemore, their hairstyles all like japanese one, both the girls and boys.<br><br>so......these privates schools(for e.g : MDIS and informatics) really got a lot of japanese kids meh? if not, then are they SG idiots who want to act japanese?<br>but cannot be leh.....most SG people i know are more western-oriented than japanese-oriented leh. so what's your views?</div>
