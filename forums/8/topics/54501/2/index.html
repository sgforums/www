            <div class='col-md body'>this year's fireworks abit sucky leh and also weird<br><br>they allowed a waiting time for the smoke from the first wave of fireworks to clear before launching the second wave.<br><br>on the other hand it could be simply safety precautions or simply it looks beautiful that way.<br>safety precautions as in if they launch the fireworks in rapid sucession,heat builds up, i know each firework got it's own tube. i mean at least u wont have all the hot tubes placed together.<br><br>or it could be that launch separately nicer.<br><br>BUT, in the second or third wave, the fireworks were launched in quick succession, abit screwed-up, like take photos also dunno waht to take,dunno what is the focus of my photo like that.<br><br>anyway will post the photos i took soon.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i like the feu-de-joie, the bomb burst, the transformation (because i'm part of it), the firing of the sparklettes (this one too) and the fireworks. most of all, i like the atmosphere in the stadium. it was indeed touching and exciting standing on the field and hearing the cheers, it juz makes me so high...<br><br>i also especially like the music during the presidential drive-past and the 'sars' song. anyone noes wat's the title of these two pieces of music?<br><br>and the moment when SM LKY appeared, the whole stadium gave a standing ovation and a loud loud cheer. i was really touched. afterall, he is my most respected person in this country after my parents. without him singapore won't be what it is now...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I saw TP escortion of 2 white cars (dunno whether it's the president or PM?) turning into Nicoll Highway from Java Road at around 7pm.<br><br>Many of the spectators outside the stadium dunno the fireworks have 2 parts, many of them went off after the first and so they missed the second.<br><br>I felt that the fireworks yesterday is not very nice and shorter compared to previous years.<br><br></div>
