Pratically brainless bunch of people who, out of being self centered, vent their anger on people who are innocent and made a fool out of themselves in public. If they are teachers, that's even worse, talk about moral education, obviously such people don't practise what they preach lol.

In HDB blocks, buses, MRT, shopping centres, hawkers, on the sidewalks. Sometimes they piss you off once, sometimes more than once.<br><br>Then your stomach is on fire. You wonder if you should retaliate. Most of the time it's verbal, scolding them back.<br><br>But remember, whether you scold them back or hit them, you must be prepared to answer for the consequences. If you scold them and they walk away, fine, you win. But what if some old fool pulls out his/her umbrella and pokes you in the eye?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let me share a story here too.  It happened to me on Dec 7th 2006, around 8++pm.<br><br>My gf and I was at Orchard, at the singtel shop there (now only 1 shop left) looking for a new phone.  Being the cheapo I am, I chose a N73 and was queueing up to make payment for my phone.<br><br>Just in front of the queue, there was a couple.  Just like me, they were purchasing a phone too and was making payment at the counter.  The difference is that the lady was talking so loudly to her bf that you wont have any problems hearing her outside the shop.<br><br>As the lady was making payment to the cashier, she realised that she was 2 bucks short of the amount and ask her bf to loan her the amount. When her bf says that he dun have 2 bucks, she starts to hitting him and call him useless, saying stuff like he dun even have 2 bucks with him so on so for etc.  It was an super embarassing situation for the gentlemen here as almost everyone turned to look at the counter to see what is happening.<br><br>At the spur at the moment, I turned and ask my gf whether she got 2 bucks to lend me or not..  she asked me for what, and I look at the couple.  Somehow after the lady heard thatthat, miricaously, she managed to dig out the 2 bucks difference and pay the balance.  And while walking out, she continued scolding her bf.  The staff and I laughed a bit, I paid up and left~<br><br>I wonder how the guy can tahan with so much verbal and physical abuse?  the lady a far way of being a beauty.  hmmm... love~ -.-"</div>
