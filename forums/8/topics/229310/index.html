            <div class='col-md body'>I was on board bus 804 five minutes ago at yishun. There's this lady in her 30s, with a grouchy face. I would have guessed that she had been sacked by her boss or something. Initially when she board the bus she pushed me, thinking that maybe she don't mean it, i did not do anything. At the point of alighting, when i was obviously going down the bus, her hand swipe towards my chest intentionally (obviously she's pushing me) and out of my conscious mind, i blurted out "sh*t" and she gave me an angry stare and dare me to repeat again, i said, "you pushed me intentionally and get all angry for what?" she was furious and said, "call your parents NOW!" i was like LAUGH OUT LOUD you a two year old or what? I try to talk to her nicely at this point of time and said "look, why don't we reason this out, i was obviously alighting and you pushed me.." before i could continue she shouted "CALL YOUR PARENTS NOW, OR I'LL CALL 999" I nearly laugh and told her "call lor!" HAHA! she's retarted i suppose. Knowing i have to rush out my project, i turn my head and walked home. Well lady i really really really hope you'll be literate enough to get online and read this post. I would have called her a female dog but who knows, next moment she might sue me with her all her livelihood lol. No common sense</div>
