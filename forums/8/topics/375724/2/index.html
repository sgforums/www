              <p><span style="color: #808080;">OUR NESS: The Google Earth image showing the "mystery" shape. Is it the Loch Alex Monster or something much less mysterious? </span></p>
              <p>Satellite shots reveal a mysterious lake monster <br><br>MATT CUNNINGHAM<br><br>September 17th, 2009 <br> <br><br>BIG NESS: Is this it? Jason Cooke says this Google Earth image looks just like the Loch Ness Monster. Picture: THE SUN<br> <br><br>COULD this be the Loch Alexander Monster ... or is it something a lot less mysterious? <br><br>The images captured on Google Earth show a large brown object in the murky water at Lake Alexander, where a giant cod bit a woman on the foot last month.<br><br>The image has some wondering if the Loch Alexander Monster could still be at large despite Darwin City Council's claims it has caught the man-eating fish.<br><br>It follows a similar Google Earth sighting at Loch Ness in Scotland - home of the infamous Loch Ness Monster.<br><br>The London Sun newspaper reported that a websurfer believed Google Earth had picked up an image of the Loch Ness Monster.<br><br>Security guard Jason Cooke said the 65ft oblong shape followed by thin strands is actually an image of the possibly mythical creature supposed to inhabit Loch Ness in the Scottish Highlands. <br><br>Mr Cooke told the Sun: "I couldn't believe it. It's just like the descriptions of Nessie."<br><br>But sceptics believe it might be a boat.<br><br>Sceptics a bit closer to home have suggested that the object seen in Lake Alexander might just be the pump that filters the water.<br><br>But that would just be boring.<br><br>We estimate our own "mystery" Loch object or beast to be approximately 5m long or wide.<br><br>There has been a rush on mystery aquatic beast sightings recently.<br><br>Two weeks ago Sydney cryptozoologist Rex Gilroy said he had sighted Sydney's own "Nessie", claiming he witnessed a 12m giant surface in the Hawkesbury River.<br><br>Through binoculars Mr Gilroy saw a dark shadow "with a longish neck" near Wiseman's Ferry.<br><br>Mr Gilroy, who has been searching for Sydney's beast since 1965, said he believed it was a plesiosaur from the Jurassic period.<br><br>Mr Gilroy, known for his research on the western Sydney panther, said neither the NSW nor Scottish "Nessies" were alone (we haven't told him about Darwin's yet).<br><br>"We'd have to have a breeding population of no less than 300 to 600," he said.<br><br>"We're dealing with ocean creatures coming into the river to breed. There are areas of ocean ... anything could live down there and you wouldn't know it."<br><br>After hearing of the Hawkesbury Monster in 1965 he found accounts dating back to pre-colonial times, with stories told of children being attacked by the "moolyewonk".<br><br>When fishing boats were found overturned and the occupants missing in the 1980s, the Hawkesbury Monster was the prime suspect.<br><br>"We have rock art depicting them. It seems the Aboriginal people knew of these creatures," Mr Gilroy said. <br><br>Enthusiasts also believe the Loch Ness creature is a plesiosaur - an aquatic reptile that appeared at the start of the Jurassic period and is widely believed to now be extinct.<br><br>Adrian Shine, a researcher on the Loch Ness project, said the new images publicised by Mr Cooke were "really intriguing" and deserved further study.<br><img src="http://www.ntnews.com.au/images/uploadedfiles/editorial/pictures/2009/09/17/loch-ness-monster.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="205"></p>

              <p>New Zealand (ChattahBox) - A species of eagle that became extinct just over 500 year ago may have eaten human, scientists claim.<br><br>The Haast’s eagle, a giant raptor, has long since baffled researchers, not only about it’s date of extinction, but the nature of the eagle itself.<br><br>But Paul Scofield of the Canterbury Museum in New Zealand and Ken Ashwell of the University of New South Wales in Australia have collaborated on a study that has solved a few of those mysteries.<br><br>The eagle apparently weighed around 40 pounds, and was very fast. It would swoop down on other, smaller birds, and occasionally on humans that were within it’s line of sight.<br><br>Despite many researchers believing for years that the Haast’s eagle was a scavenger, this evidence suggests that it was actually a fierce and effective predator.</p>
              <p>Over the last century, there have been sightings of giant birds all over America since 1890. The phenomenon is known as "The Thunderbird Sightings" . The subject has been much researched and books were written by researchers. Some have theorized that the Thunderbird is a species of pterosaur, such as a pterodactyl, which has survived the prehistoric age, while others suggest it could be a type of condor or oversized vulture. In response to skeptics who claim that a bird with a 15-foot (4.6 m) wingspan would be unable to fly, researchers point out that the largest flying creature in history, the Quetzalcoatlus northropi, had a wingspan of 25-60 feet (7.6 - 18.3 m).</p>
              <p>The widely proposed explaination of these thunderbirds seem to be attributed to actual known fossil species such as pteratron or the Haast’s eagle, which recently became extinct and had been living in the areas where the sightings were reported.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.cryptozoology.com/articles/images/huffer2-1.gif" alt="" width="300" height="339"></p>
              <p>The birds may have been possibly sighted in 1977 living alive and well. In 1977, a man named John Huffer took a video  film of two large birds taking flight from a tree. To this day, it is the best and only evidence of the Thunderbird's existence. The 100 roll video footage film left researchers and experts baffled.</p>
              <p>Video Link: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmV_bIqhLw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNmV_bIqhLw </a></p>
              <p>Although the sighting was mentioned by the Discovery Channel on their show. Thunderbird sightings have continued into the new millennium, including a 2002 sighting in Alaska where witnesses claimed to have seen a large, flying creature with a wingspan of roughly 14 feet (4.2 m). In 2004, a student in Southern California also reported seeing an unusually large creature flying over a suburban area which matched the Thunderbird’s description.</p>
              <p>Interesting Sighting Details:<br>There have been thunderbird sightings from different countries around the world, and southwestern states in the USA, but no place comes close to the number of sightings as Pennsylvania, USA.<br>There have been reports of thunderbird sightings throughout Pennsylvania, but most of the sightings come from areas known as the Black Forest region which encompasses Clinton, Potter, Lycoming, Tioga, Cameron, and McKean counties. These areas are sparsely populated state forest and game lands.</p>

              <p> <strong>Japanese Photograph</strong><br> <em>1992 - Taken by a Japanese film crew while flying over Lake
                  Tele, the legendary home of Mokele-mbembe, this photograph seems to
                  show a large, long creature swimming in the water.</em></p>
              <p><br> Coincidentally, that same year the world famous zoologist and
                  biologist, Ivan T. Sanderson, along with animal-trader Gerald
                  Russel, were paddling up the Mainyu River in the heart of western
                  Africa when, according to Sanderson's report:<br> <br> "The most terrifying sound I have ever heard, which sounded like an
                  on-coming earthquake or an exploding, nearby robot, suddenly
                  greeted us from a large underwater cave."<br> <br> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>W</em></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>hile the water of the river was boiling and foaming directly in
                  front of their canoe, a darkish, shining lizard-like head suddenly
                  rose from the dark water. They described the head as nearly the
                  size of the head of a fully grown hippo, which sat on a thick,
                  swan-like neck.</em></span></strong><strong><em> </em></strong>The enormous neck was turned towards the two men,
                  and for just a few seconds, although it seemed like an eternity,
                  the monster simply stared at Sanderson and Russel. Mr. Sanderson
                  summed up his thoughts with these emphatic words:</p>
              <p>"I don't know what we saw, but the animal, the monster, burned
                  itself into my retinas. It looked like something that ought to have
                  been dead millions of years ago. As a scientist, I should have been
                  happy, of course, but this encounter was so frightening, so nasty
                  that I never want to see it again."<br> <br></p>

Jason Cooke says this Google Earth image looks just like the Loch Ness Monster. Picture: THE SUN<br><br><br>COULD this be the Loch Alexander Monster ... or is it something a lot less mysterious?<br><br>The images captured on Google Earth show a large brown object in the murky water at Lake Alexander, where a giant cod bit a woman on the foot last month.<br><br>The image has some wondering if the Loch Alexander Monster could still be at large despite Darwin City Council's claims it has caught the man-eating fish.<br><br>It follows a similar Google Earth sighting at Loch Ness in Scotland - home of the infamous Loch Ness Monster.<br><br>The London Sun newspaper reported that a websurfer believed Google Earth had picked up an image of the Loch Ness Monster.<br><br>Security guard Jason Cooke said the 65ft oblong shape followed by thin strands is actually an image of the possibly mythical creature supposed to inhabit Loch Ness in the Scottish Highlands.<br><br>Mr Cooke told the Sun: "I couldn't believe it. It's just like the descriptions of Nessie."<br><br>But sceptics believe it might be a boat.<br><br>Sceptics a bit closer to home have suggested that the object seen in Lake Alexander might just be the pump that filters the water.<br><br>But that would just be boring.<br><br>We estimate our own "mystery" Loch object or beast to be approximately 5m long or wide.<br><br>There has been a rush on mystery aquatic beast sightings recently.<br><br>Two weeks ago Sydney cryptozoologist Rex Gilroy said he had sighted Sydney's own "Nessie", claiming he witnessed a 12m giant surface in the Hawkesbury River.<br><br>Through binoculars Mr Gilroy saw a dark shadow "with a longish neck" near Wiseman's Ferry.<br><br>Mr Gilroy, who has been searching for Sydney's beast since 1965, said he believed it was a plesiosaur from the Jurassic period.<br><br>Mr Gilroy, known for his research on the western Sydney panther, said neither the NSW nor Scottish "Nessies" were alone (we haven't told him about Darwin's yet).<br><br>"We'd have to have a breeding population of no less than 300 to 600," he said.<br><br>"We're dealing with ocean creatures coming into the river to breed. There are areas of ocean ... anything could live down there and you wouldn't know it."<br><br>After hearing of the Hawkesbury Monster in 1965 he found accounts dating back to pre-colonial times, with stories told of children being attacked by the "moolyewonk".<br><br>When fishing boats were found overturned and the occupants missing in the 1980s, the Hawkesbury Monster was the prime suspect.<br><br>"We have rock art depicting them. It seems the Aboriginal people knew of these creatures," Mr Gilroy said.<br><br>Enthusiasts also believe the Loch Ness creature is a plesiosaur - an aquatic reptile that appeared at the start of the Jurassic period and is widely believed to now be extinct.<br><br>Adrian Shine, a researcher on the Loch Ness project, said the new images publicised by Mr Cooke were "really intriguing" and deserved further study.<br><img src="http://www.ntnews.com.au/images/uploadedfiles/editorial/pictures/2009/09/17/loch-ness-monster.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="205"></p>
