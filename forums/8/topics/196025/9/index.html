The only way to get soft drinks during recess is to go over to the secondary school beside my primary school to get it - secretly.<br><br>And so there was once when me and my fren rode on our luck and entered the secondary school to get our drinks. We were happily slurping on the ice-cold coca-cola when suddenly some idiots from the "upper primary" shouted "Oei! Y u all go there buy coke? I tell Mr Goh! (My principal  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> )"<br><br>We ran but of cos, we got caught up. Heh. I received caning in his office.(Ouch)<br><br>Anyone remember "Overpower" or something? The marvel trading card. It was so cheap at that time.<br><br>Speaking of Street Fighter cards, I still have plenty at home. Close to 200 cards i think. And guess wad? My mom actually helped me to collect! I was damn lucky that time cos i usually get a shiny card after spending $1!<br><br>Disclosing Tablet? I was denied one when i was in P2. The dentist said i was too young den. -__-"<br><br>My allowance is only 50 cents each day! But i do remember saving $10 after each semester.<br><br>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle rocks! Leonardo! Donatello! Raphael! Michealangelo! Kawabunga! LOL!<br><br>I remember SPEED. No, not the japanese pop group. It stands for Solve Problem Easily EveryDay. LOL. My P1 maths teacher's invention.<br><br>Haha.. I used to call my primary school bag "tortoise bag". And maybe due to the heavy books that we brought to school everyday, the bag was in bad condition.
