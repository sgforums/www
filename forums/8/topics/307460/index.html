              <h1 class="clr">Varsity fees go up but cost fixed for entire course of studies</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: All three public universities in Singapore will raise the
              tuition fees for the new intakes of students starting school in the
              next academic year.</p>
              <p>Existing students and returning National Servicemen admitted earlier will not be affected by the fee increase.</p>
              <p>For
              Nanyang Technological University (NTU), the fee hike is about 4 per
              cent. This means that incoming students at NTU will pay an annual fee
              of S$6,360, up from S$6,100 last year.</p>
              <p>Most of the schools in
              National University of Singapore (NUS) will also limit the fee increase
              to about 4%. However, the Law and Business faculties at NUS will raise
              their fees by a higher amount.</p>
              <p>On top of the fee hike, NUS and
              NTU will also implement differentiated pricing, where Singapore PRs pay
              10 per cent more in tuition fees. International students will pay 50
              per cent more compared to their Singaporean counterparts.</p>
              <p>The two
              universities have also decided to implement a new fee structure called
              the "cohort—based" structure that is currently in place at the
              Singapore Management University (SMU).</p>
              <p>This means tuition fees
              for all new undergraduates will be ’locked in’ for their entire
              duration of studies. So for those entering NUS and NTU, they will pay a
              fixed amount of S$6,360 each year till they graduate.</p>
              <p>For NUS,
              this applies to those in the Arts and Social Sciences, Computing,
              Design and Environment, Engineering and Science faculties. Fees for the
              other faculties will be higher.</p>
              <p>Explaining the advantage of the
              "cohort—based" fee structure, Professor Dr Meng—Hwa Er, NTU’s Associate
              Provost, said: "They (students) know exactly what to expect in terms of
              financial needs, so they can make the necessary arrangements for their
              university education."</p>
              <p>"It definitely gives more predictability,
              and you’re not caught unawares as to when fees will increase," said
              Donald Koh, president of NUS Students’ Union.</p>
              <p>For SMU courses,
              except for the law course, the cost is fixed at S$9,130. That’s 10
              percent more than what the previous cohort has to pay.</p>
              <p>Fees for
              law students will be higher. At SMU, the jump is over 11 per cent, to
              S$10,050 for Singapore students. At NUS, it is 20 percent higher, at
              S$7,340.</p>
              <p>Other than the increase in tuition fees, the hostel fees
              at NUS will also be raised by between S$10 and S$40 per week over the
              next three years.</p>
              <p>NUS says this is because current fees are not enough to cover maintenance and upgrading costs.</p>
              <p>The
              hike has caused some students to reconsider their options. "I think
              it’s very expensive, I think it’s not worth it. I’ll probably take a
              cab to school instead of staying in a hostel," said a student.</p>
              <p>Both
              NUS and NTU say the fee hikes are necessary to meet the increase in
              manpower and operating costs in order to continue providing a quality
              education.</p>
              <p>NUS Provost and deputy president, Tan Eng Chye, said
              that the fee increase was delayed from last year due to the GST hike,
              but it could not be held off any longer.</p>
              <p>He said: "70 per cent of
              our budget goes to salaries. Look at what the salary increase has been
              in the industry, 4 per cent and 5 per cent. The increase that we are
              looking for, it’s quite clear that the fees only give us a small bit in
              terms of the increase.</p>
              <p>"People would want to see their salary
              increase, so I think the same thing I would say is if you expect salary
              increase for yourself, you should also expect the university has to
              function, I have to give salary increase for my staff as well. So it’s
              not unusual to expect a fee increase."</p>
              <p>All the three universities
              have assured that needy students will not be denied a place as there
              will be enhanced financial aid packages to help them cope. — CNA/ir</p>
