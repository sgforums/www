              <p>looking at plants...they must have water and nutrients to have green leaves for years.if they lack of them ,the leaves will dry up n look old n decayed.think this is what ageing is.</p>
              <p>but how does leaves keep so green and fresh with water?they have some thing y to send water to ever inch of leaf to keep them green and fresh.but if u were to pluck it off the tree,.it would wither n decay immediately.so if oil were added to leaf it might only make it fresh a bit longer but eventually will die.something is pumping the good juice into the leaf component that prevents it from being dried up,would this good juice be  nutrients and water?why not water alone?does the leaf need simething else to survive in its elements n make up?how do u assemble a nutrientsetup for a human as from the leaf?</p>

              <p>to prevent leaf from decaying externally:</p>
              <p>1a)stop exposing it to hot sun as it is unable to take temperature.</p>
              <p>2a)stop insects from attcking it</p>
              <p>3a)prevent fungus from attacking roots(food intake source point of leaf n tree due to moisture n bacteria)</p>
              <p>4a)ensure oxygen n co2 n o2 is met daily</p>
              <p>5a)do not shake it mechanically till leaf stems are strong enough.</p>
              <p>to prevent leaf from decaying internally:</p>
              <p>1z)ensure its fulla water with correct ph values n kept moist at all time(depends on 1a)</p>
              <p>2z)ensure pumping action from capillary action from source to leaf is supplied by keeping it moist.</p>
              <p>3z)ensure stem from leaf steam to tree is strong and not dry at any point from day 1to grow bigger n stronger leaf support areas(depends on 1a)this will in turn supply needed water n nutrients to prevent decay of leaf and enhance life of leaf.</p>
              <p>4z)ensure enough sunlight for chlorphyl food making actions in plant.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>to enhance leaf to survive for years when lifespan of average leaf is only 8 months:</p>
              <p>soak it with nutrients....but leaf plucked from tree would die instantly....so connection to treee due to some circulation devices from within is clearly observed.what does a tree do to a leaf?recirculate like a heart n kidney component?but leaf still dies when that happens.could be from external sources or the tree had no strong leaves and strong supports that would weaken leaf n break off all supply lines from tree to leaf.however would it be different in zero grvity enviroments where gravity would not exert force on leaf supply points from tree?put it in zero gravity as in under water but that still has a force exerted by water on skin ,heart etc.</p>
              <p> build a stronger supply connection from plant to leaf .or the small area to have them made better to supply nutrients and cooling gel to prevent drying of leaf.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>in humans:5a  would be an issue as its unknows how big or small to human tissues really are or how to make them better.that would inturn depend on 3z.</p>
              <p>fulla water in 1z is not known how much is too much or too little and ph value is not known for humans to have desired effect.</p>
              <p>2z depends on heart function which also is affected by another different factors such as temp and medium within it.</p>
              <p>4z is obtained by food from supermarket which is digested n converted to energy required for survival.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>to be con't........</p>
