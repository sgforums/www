But she insists...<br><br>By Joyce Lim </strong><br><br>SHE came to Singapore six months ago hoping to find a husband. But this attractive China-born woman got more than that.<br><br>She now has four suitors who have all become her sugar daddies.<br><br>So smitten are the four Singaporean men that they try and outshine one another.<br><br>They buy her expensive gifts, treat her to expensive dinners in top restaurants and give her cash (as pocket money) regularly.<br><br>Three of them are married and one is a bachelor.<br><br>Try telling Sherry (not her real name) that she is leading the life of a kept woman and she shakes her head vehemently.<br><br>'I'm not exclusive to any one of them.<br><br>'I go out with anyone I like. They give me money and buy me gifts willingly. I don't ask for anything,' said Sherry, who is here on a student pass.<br><br>She is currently attending a course in an art and design school - and her fees are paid by one of her boyfriends.<br><br>Sherry is drop-dead gorgeous. She has a fair complexion and a busty figure. Standing at 1.68m tall, she struck an elegant figure in a blue sundress when this reporter met her last week.<br><br>She bears a strong resemblance to Hong Kong actress Carina Lau.<br><br>And she is so confident of her beauty that she has no qualms about taking what the men give her.<br><br>She said: 'I don't think I'm cheating on any of them.<br><br>'One of them had offered to support me and give me $4,000 to $5,000 a month,' she said, which would have more than covered her accommodation and living expenses.<br><br><strong>But she declined his offer, saying: 'Why would I want to to be a kept woman when now I have my freedom and I still get that kind of money, or more, from all four?'</strong><br><br>Sherry, who is in her mid-30s, declined to be named or photographed as she does not want her boyfriends to know about her two-timing... no, four-timing game.<br><br>But her boyfriends accept that they do not have exclusive rights to her time.<br><br>Unlike many of her friends who came to Singapore with her from Shenzhen, Sherry does not have to work in a nightclub to make a living.<br><br>One week after she arrived in Singapore in August last year, she met her first boyfriend in a pub at Mohammad Sultan Road.<br><br>The rest were introduced to her by her friends.<br><br>Three of them run their own businesses and the fourth is a property agent.<br><br>'Although my boyfriends know I'm not exclusive to them and that I do meet other people, I don't tell them everything about my lifestyle and what I do,' said Sherry. She said she finds Singaporean men caring and generous.<br><br><strong>Every morning, one of them takes her to school.<br><br>Another picks her up after classes.<br><br>She gives most of her free time to the man who spends the most money on her.<br></strong><br>Last month, one of her businessman boyfriends, who still figures in her life, spent $10,000 on Sherry in just two weeks.<br><br>He bought her a diamond ring which she took to a jeweller the next day to have it verified as genuine. (It was.)<br><br>'He also bought a Gucci handbag for me. But I told him I didn't really like the design. So he went to get me another one from Louis Vuitton,' said Sherry.<br><br>The same boyfriend also spent about $3,000 on a desktop computer for her so she could play computer games and surf the Internet when she gets bored at home.<br><br><strong>HELPS WITH RENTAL </strong><br><br>She claims another man offered to rent a two-storey detached house for her.<br><br>'He said that I could sublet the extra rooms to collect rental every month,' said Sherry.<br><br>'But I didn't accept his offer because if I did, he would have been able to come to the house whenever he wanted to. I want my privacy.'<br><br>Sherry is now staying in a rented condominium in the east with one of her friends from China.<br><br>Her $600 share of the monthly rental is paid by one of her boyfriends.<br><br><span style="color: red;">'It's better this way because then he can't come to the apartment as and when he wants to. He doesn't rent the apartment for me, but he is only helping me with the rental.'</span><br><br>She claims she does not feel compelled to have sex with all her four boyfriends. 'I don't sleep with them to pay them back for whatever they have given me. I sleep with them only when I want to.<br><br>'And of course they'll have to use a condom,' she said matter of factly.<br><br>'I don't have anything to lose in this way.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>The 'poor man' gets last... </strong><br><br>TO juggle her time between four boyfriends, Sherry schedules time slots for each of them, said one of her friends.<br><br>But there's also a fifth man, Mr Andy Tan, 30, and he gets the last slot of the day.<br><br>That's because he's not rich enough to be one of her four boyfriends.<br><br>Usually he does not get to see Sherry before 11pm because he is 'a poor man, earning less than $2,000 a month,' he said.<br><br>'I won't be able to splurge on her like the rest,' he admitted.<br><br>So he doesn't get the chance to be with Sherry during what he calls her 'prime hours' - from 6pm to 11pm.<br><br>During that period, she sometimes sees up to two men.<br><br>Mr Tan considers himself just a friend.<br><br>He said: 'I don't think she considers me as her boyfriend although we've had sex before.'<br><br>Sherry told The New Paper on Sunday that she was currently dating four men. But she did not mention Mr Tan.<br><br>'I don't give her any pocket money and I can't afford to take her to expensive restaurants, so naturally I don't get to see her during prime hours,' said Mr Tan, who first met Sherry at a pub on Mohammad Sultan Road.<br><br>He said: 'I was introduced to her by one of her girlfriends.<br><br>'Her friend saw me drinking alone at the bar counter and asked whether she could join me.<br><br>'She then introduced Sherry to me.<br><br>'Right from the start, I told her that I'm not rich.<br><br>'Maybe at that time she had just arrived in Singapore and had fewer friends, so she didn't mind going out with me.'<br><br><strong>HAS A WAY WITH MEN </strong><br><br>Mr Tan thinks the other men are willing to splurge on Sherry because she is beautiful and has a way with men.<br><br>She doesn't accept everything that men offer her.<br><br>That shows she is street-wise, said Mr Tan.<br><br>'I think she's very smart, because men would then think that she is unlike other China women and that she has personality,' said Mr Tan, who declined to reveal his occupation.<br><br>'She's definitely not like the Singapore girls I've dated before.<br><br>'She is very feminine and gives you all the attention you want. She is also good in bed.'<br><br>It's the first time Mr Tan has dated a China-born woman.<br><br>Sherry is the envy of her China friends.<br><br>'She doesn't need to work in a nightclub like most of us,' said one of them, who only wants to be known as Qiqi.<br><br>'She is beautiful and can get any man she likes. Isn't life so unfair?'<br></div>

I sleep with them only when I want to.<br><br>'And of course they'll have to use a condom,' she said matter of factly.<br><br>'I don't have anything to lose in this way.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>The 'poor man' gets last... </strong><br><br>TO juggle her time between four boyfriends, Sherry schedules time slots for each of them, said one of her friends.<br><br>But there's also a fifth man, Mr Andy Tan, 30, and he gets the last slot of the day.<br><br>That's because he's not rich enough to be one of her four boyfriends.<br><br>Usually he does not get to see Sherry before 11pm because he is 'a poor man, earning less than $2,000 a month,' he said.<br><br>'I won't be able to splurge on her like the rest,' he admitted.<br><br>So he doesn't get the chance to be with Sherry during what he calls her 'prime hours' - from 6pm to 11pm.<br><br>During that period, she sometimes sees up to two men.<br><br>Mr Tan considers himself just a friend.<br><br>He said: 'I don't think she considers me as her boyfriend although we've had sex before.'<br><br>Sherry told The New Paper on Sunday that she was currently dating four men. But she did not mention Mr Tan.<br><br>'I don't give her any pocket money and I can't afford to take her to expensive restaurants, so naturally I don't get to see her during prime hours,' said Mr Tan, who first met Sherry at a pub on Mohammad Sultan Road.<br><br>He said: 'I was introduced to her by one of her girlfriends.<br><br>'Her friend saw me drinking alone at the bar counter and asked whether she could join me.<br><br>'She then introduced Sherry to me.<br><br>'Right from the start, I told her that I'm not rich.<br><br>'Maybe at that time she had just arrived in Singapore and had fewer friends, so she didn't mind going out with me.'<br><br><strong>HAS A WAY WITH MEN </strong><br><br>Mr Tan thinks the other men are willing to splurge on Sherry because she is beautiful and has a way with men.<br><br>She doesn't accept everything that men offer her.<br><br>That shows she is street-wise, said Mr Tan.<br><br>'I think she's very smart, because men would then think that she is unlike other China women and that she has personality,' said Mr Tan, who declined to reveal his occupation.<br><br>'She's definitely not like the Singapore girls I've dated before.<br><br>'She is very feminine and gives you all the attention you want. She is also good in bed.'<br><br>It's the first time Mr Tan has dated a China-born woman.<br><br>Sherry is the envy of her China friends.<br><br>'She doesn't need to work in a nightclub like most of us,' said one of them, who only wants to be known as Qiqi.<br><br>'She is beautiful and can get any man she likes. Isn't life so unfair?'<br>[/b]</blockquote>wonder y this four idiots fancy tis china bitch so much kenna black magic ar?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
