            <div class='col-md body'>Hi.. This is officially my very first topic i am posting in this forum.. As a matter of fact, i just came into this forum site today at a recommendation of a friend. Anyways... am not sure how far the topic will go.. its also kinda soppy but i guess it is something on my mind... so help me out ok?<br><br>Does anyone out there knows of any married people that indulges in affairs? What exactly do you feel about such people? Is there a right or wrong to it? I mean... if ya stuck in a marriage that's totally wrong for you but you cant get out of.... issit ok to shower your love to someone else instead? or must u stick by your spouse no matter wat?<br><br>I am sure there's a reason why this line <span style="font-style: italic;">"for better or for worse"</span> was put into marriage vows in the first place.... so why are there so many married people out there who are indulging in extra-marital affairs. It not only hurts their own family... but the person whom the person is having an affair with.... Imagine.. falling in love with a married person... it can also be quite painful.<br><br>A society curse where marriage vows done stand true anymore and everyone lives in hushed acceptance?  Somehow i think so.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting topic...<br><br>Firstly welcome to you i'm a newbie too so we can both suck thumbs together <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> i'll suck mine and u'll suck urs.. for now.<br><br>ok seriously,<br><br>i take marraige seriously even tho i'm still unmarried. however marraige was conceived by man. nowadays it's a piece of paper and a declaration that two pple are in a relationship together and legally allowed to buy a HDB flat.. among other things.<br><br>that's now. wat about then? yes THEN.. WAY WAY b4 policemen wore shorts. men lived in caves. they hunted and gathered while the women stayed in the caves cooking and looking after the children. were they married? did they have papers to sign on? WERE THEY MONOGAMOUS?<br><br>i dunno about the manogamy. but i do know about their commitment to their families. the men would bring back the food the women would cook and make clothes from the animals' skins. they wouldn't be caught neglecting such responsibilities.<br><br>so were they married? in my view yes they were. no paper but yes everything else seems to be there. it's just that today we have that extra thing - a piece of paper with a bit of ink on it.<br><br>now i come to my point:<br><br>besides legal issues and wat society has become, there is NO DIFFERENCE between a married couple and an unmarried one. actually one good example in today's context is that of a de facto relationship. may not be that common in sg but it's common overseas. such a relationship sees two pple (can even be of the same sex!) living together and even having children but are not married. they just don't feel the need to be married.<br><br>so to answer your question, i urge u to think of a married couple as one that isn't.<br><br>is it ok for someone to be unfaithful if he is not married? well of cos not. but that doesn't mean it's WORSE if he does it when he is married. it's the same thing.<br><br>and should a person stick to his marraige if it is totally wrong for him? he doesn't have to. same reason why a person in a non-married relationship always has a choice to break up becos it just doesn't or won't work. (read my topic on compatability titled "Read this only if you have time" )<br><br>enuff said. to me a marraige in today's terms is only becos of wat society has evolved to be. there is no difference. the only difference is that we are all unique. that's why relns work or don't. it doesn't matter whether u are married or not.<br><br>and sometimes... that piece of paper CAN make things worse. let's leave that for another topic/post.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>
