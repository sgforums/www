            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe you can try to be close to her at this moment cos this is the time when she needs someone by her side. Ask her out to meals, give her surprises just to make her happy. Don't say you wanted to chase her/ be her steady yet cos she is still in the state of uncertainty. Just make her feels that you are always by her side whenever she is down. Finally never remind her any thing about relationship yet. (I am not sure what will happen) One thing is that she needs someone to be with her after the break up.<br>But why does she have a bf and crush u at the same time????  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
