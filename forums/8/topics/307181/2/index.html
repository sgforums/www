              <p><br>not being able to spell doesnt have to do with not being able to take criticism. just pointing out your flawed criticism. if u wanna criticize at least do it without involving me being unable to take real and truthful criticism.</p>
              <p>lol not accepting lies = not able to take criticism? why not let me slander you at your workplace and at your home with lies. lies that your colleagues and your wife become convinced of.</p>

              <p><br>not being able to spell doesnt have to do with not being able to take criticism. just pointing out your flawed criticism. if u wanna criticize at least do it without involving me being unable to take real and truthful criticism.</p>

              <p><br>ok here is it chronologically:</p>
              <p>me innocent little kid.</p>
              <p>father no head no tail uses that line.</p>
              <p>father compares himself to africans all the time in a childish tone.</p>
              <p>brainless father thinks hes cute all the time like dragging the leg of my brother out of bed when calling him to wake up for sch.</p>
              <p>father being an embarrassment all the time with his fake american accent whenever he uses english and lame jokes and antics.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>blahhhh but anyway the point of that problem thread is he made me feel guilty whenever i think about making money. not about wealth here but about his lameness which dragged me down. down as in people skills and having nothing to look forward to.</p>

              <p>Mudkipz, i dun really get wats gg on here, but wat i believe is that u came to this forum some advice or just to complain what makes u upset... Ur parents... What did they do to u? Rape u? arrange marriage with an old man, sell u to orphanage? wat?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Tell us what happen so that we noe what's gg on so that flamers gt nothing to flame about rather than just scolding ur parents shi.tty. if its not about money then wat? attitude?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>what i believe that some flamers up there intended to say is not abt wealth(gif u money for sch, gif u home etc.) I guess that they r pissed about u being ungrateful in a way calling ur parents shi.tty.</p>

              <p>you go slander PAP and see what you get.</p>
              <p>ok firstly i want to point out here that you spoke before finding out what those "lies" are. anyway one of those that i know of is that he says i dont respect him. when asked why i dont respect him he says listen to everything he says. but then the things he say are like childish and wrong ones due to him looking down on kids. in my sec sch the teachers whom he instructed to speak with me didnt even know in what way i was disrespecting him. lmao</p>
              <p>if he can go out and tell tales about me, i can come here and say he is shi.tty.</p>

              <p>Somehow or someway monetary problems also came into this picture, there is no denying that fact,.</p>
              <p><br>About the attitude from your dad, maybe you should sit down with him alone and have a little talk with him? i'm sure at this age, your dad will understand the problems that u are having with him. It might not be a success but at least it is the first step to trying to make this situation better. Your dad might also realize that he is being childish in some way(maybe to impress you or spread the word that being young and happy is the way of life) would eventually let u appreciate him better?</p>
              <p><br>the point is, cherish your parents/family while u still can. The lost of a Loved One is not a joke, when that day comes.. u will understand, i felt that way just recently and i wish u take that as a learning point for yourself.</p>
              <p>Don't be angry just because ur dad is embarassing you, tolerate it! One day u might just sit down and tell yourself that u would want him to do those silly acts agian,</p>
