              <p>Somehow or someway monetary problems also came into this picture, there is no denying that fact,.</p>
              <p><br>About the attitude from your dad, maybe you should sit down with him alone and have a little talk with him? i'm sure at this age, your dad will understand the problems that u are having with him. It might not be a success but at least it is the first step to trying to make this situation better. Your dad might also realize that he is being childish in some way(maybe to impress you or spread the word that being young and happy is the way of life) would eventually let u appreciate him better?</p>
              <p><br>the point is, cherish your parents/family while u still can. The lost of a Loved One is not a joke, when that day comes.. u will understand, i felt that way just recently and i wish u take that as a learning point for yourself.</p>
              <p>Don't be angry just because ur dad is embarassing you, tolerate it! One day u might just sit down and tell yourself that u would want him to do those silly acts agian,</p>
