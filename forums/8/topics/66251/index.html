            <div class='col-md body'><strong>It's All in the Name</strong>  <span style="font-style: italic;">(Contributed by Swee Tong)</span><br><br>During an official visit to Thailand, DPM Tony Tan, DPM BG Lee Hsien Loong and opposition MP Chiam See Tong went to visit the notorious red light district Patpong. Soon enough, a pretty prostitute beckoned to the three politicians. As they all moved towards her, BG Lee halted them.<br><br>He told Tony Tan, "Tony, tan." ("Tan" in Hokkien is "wait".)<br><br>He then told Chiam See Tong, "Chiam see tong." (Hokkien for "temporarily hold on".)<br><br>He then pointed at himself and said, "Lee, hsien loong." ("Hsien loong" sounds like Hokkien for "bang first".)<br><br><strong>Do we have to spell it out for you?</strong>  <span style="font-style: italic;">(Contributed by Jiaho Cheo)</span><br><br>Once upon a time, the Singapore media industry was free to report just about anything. That is why they were called RTS, as the reporters were free to Roam The Street and Report True Stories.<br><br>However, under the leadership of Mr. LEE (Loves Editing Everything), RTS became SBC (Script By Censorship). Soon, most of the reporters quit while those who stayed behind had to work under Si Bay Chum conditions.<br><br>Since these reporters could not roam the streets or report true stories, they had to fabricate Si Beh Choon ('choon' is Cantonese for 'stupid') stories that nobody wants to know.<br><br>Only the students from NUS (Nothing Up Stair) thought the reports were Si Beh Cheem.<br><br>Then SBC started to employ these students as reporters. As there was nothing that could be freely reported, SBC changed its name to TCS (Totally Censored Station) and become a Talk Cock Station only.<br><br>Hopefully, TCS will not change its name again to NCS (No Choice Station).<br><br><strong>Just expressing my... whatÂ’s that again?</strong><br><br>A Russian, an Ethiopian and a Singaporean were being surveyed by the World Bank. The question was "What is your opinion on how much money you spend on food?"<br><br>The Ethiopian asked, "What is food?"<br><br>The Russian asked, "What is money?"<br><br>The Singaporean asked, "What is an opinion?"<br><br>from <a href="http://www.talkingcock.com" rel="nofollow">www.talkingcock.com</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok the following are not political...<br><br><strong>Democratic Blasphemy </strong> <span style="font-style: italic;">(Contributed by Edwin)</span><br><br>Why is it that Adam and Eve could not have been Chinese?<br>Because if Satan took the form of a snake and tempted them to eat the forbidden fruit, Eve would have said, "Quick, Adam! Catch the snake also! Snake also can eat, mah!"<br><br>Why is it that Adam and Eve could not have been Malay?<br>Because if Satan took the form of a snake and tempted them to eat the forbidden fruit, both Adam and Eve would have said to him, "Relac lah! Tomorrow also can eat!"<br><br>Why is that Adam and Eve could not have been Indian?<br>Because they would have conned the snake into eating the apple.<br><br><strong>Can Die</strong><span style="font-style: italic;">  (Contributed by Setzer)</span><br><br>There was this case in a hospital's intensive care ward where patients always died in the same bed and always on Friday mornings, regardless of their medical conditions.<br><br>This puzzled the doctors and some even thought that it had to do with the supernatural. So the doctors decided to go down to that particular ward to investigate the cause.<br><br>Come Friday morning, everyone at the hospital ward nervously waited for the terrible phenomenon to occur again. Some held wooden crosses, prayer books and other holy objects to ward off evil....<br><br>As the time approached, their hearts began beating anxiously, and with every beat of the clock, everyone held their breath........ .... Then Ah Soh, the part-time Friday cleaner, came into the room and unplugged the life support system so that she could use the vacuum cleaner.<br></div>
