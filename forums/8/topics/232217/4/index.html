Fringe cannot be striaght. onli when after bathe then straight. but when dry, go curly at the fringe.

Their haircut also not bad. And for gdnesssake, dun rebond whole head, it will look wierd, rebond onli the frindge. nowdays, styling onli take me 10 mins and i'm out of hse.. save me from so much trouble. will go rebond every 3 months or 4 months.
