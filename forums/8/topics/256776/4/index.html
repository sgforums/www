            <div class='col-md body'>My advice is pay a little bit more and get a pc from a reliable manufacturer with warrenty and onsite repair. These days, sim lim is so cut throat, they are killing themselves. No point saving a few hundred or few dollars for so much trouble. Anyway, these days manufacturer PCs are getting cheaper and cheaper.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Take caution from buying inhouse brand PC from nonreputable shops. They can be cheaper &amp; give 5-yr warranty. All they hv to do is to close down &amp; open another shop with another shop name &amp; there goes your warranty.</div>
