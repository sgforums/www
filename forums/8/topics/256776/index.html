            <div class='col-md body'>Dear members, i am a loyal fan of SG forums and i hope to let you all know what i faced so that all bros and sis will not end up like me. I usually read but don't post and i registered just because i want to make this post. It is very long, but please read on for the whole story...<br><br>About one month ago, i went to Sim Lim to shop for a new PC. After some comparison, i found this shop PC Themes at #04-19 which prices are about few bucks cheaper so i went ahead and bought everything there. To be specific, P4 1GBddr 80GBhddsk DVDrive.<br><br>So after buying, i went back to fix it. I realised the they did not give me the SATA cable. So i had to wait next day to buy a new one because going back just for that cable will be stupid. After using ORIGINAL WindowsXP, i realised that i was unable to enter Windows. I tried several troubleshooting, like reinstalling Windows and refixing the cables at least 5 times but still failed.<br><br>So the third day, i went back and told him the problem i faced, and my suspicion that the mainboard was faulty. He asked me to go walk around whilst he fix it so i did. After more that 1 hour, i went back to the shop and realised he was fixing another PC!!! It was about 9pm, and i was the only customer. I know what first come first serve means, but look, that PC's  owner was not around, and he asked me to go walk around so shouldn't he fix my PC first?!?! CHESSEPIES!!! But i am a patient person so i waited there and didn't make a noise. The technician started to fix it with their hardisk, IGNORING my claim that the mainboard is faulty.<br><br>So i waited and about 1 hour later, they confirmed it was the mainboard and reluctantly gave me a replacement. I went back home feeling pissed off and fixed everything. THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF THE NIGHTMARE...<br><br>About 1 month later, the PC crashed. I did some troubleshooting, and guessed that the HDDSK was faulty. So i took the PC to back to PC THEMES and informed them of my observations and speculation. I know i am not very good in computer, but i am not an IDIOT!!! Why do i say that??? Read on...<br><br>They asked me to walk around once again, and i did, for about 2 hours. When i came back, they HAVE NOT TOUCHED MY PC!!! So they asked me to leave contact and will call me when they fix it. HELLO!!! WHY DID YOU ASK ME TO WALK AROUND?!?! CHEESEPIES!!!<br><br>Time passed, and within 2 weeks, TWO WEEKS!!! I called them at least 6 times, AT LEAST SIX TIMES!!! Everytime they will tell me they are fixing and will call me back. How many times did they call me back?? ZERO!!! NONE!!! I feel like an IDIOT!!! What kind of service is this?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! CHEESEPIES!!!<br><br>The third week, i called 4 times and told them it is taking too long. First time, told me technician at lunch and will call me back. Did they?? NO!!! Second time, told me he on leave, call me back. Did they?? NO!!! Third time, another technician said he troubleshooting and will call me back. This time that another one did call me back and told me they SUSPECT is my Windows XP PIRATED and asked me for CDKEY!!!<br><br>After awhile, he finally called me back and told me suspect is HDDSK failure. SUSPECT?? THEIR SKILLS LOUSIER THAN MINE??? NVM. Fourth time, the original technician picked up and told me is the HDDSK spoil. So i asked him whether can replace it for me. He said, as expected, will try to find and call me back. DID HE??? NO!!!<br><br>Entering fourth week, i called and he told me no replacement for it. NO REPLACEMENT??? IN THE WHOLE PC SHOP NO REPLACEMENT??? NVM. He then told me will be sending it for repairs. So i asked him how long and he said 2 to 3 weeks??? WHAT??? 2 TO 3 WEEKS?!?!?!<br><br>So i LL and waited because i thought he telling the truth. One week later i told my friend working in Hewlett Packard this story and he told me HDDSK CANNOT BE FIXED!!! WTF??? HE LIED TO ME?!?!?! I was furious and went down to the shop to see my PC on one corner of the floor collecting dust. I told the boss, 'hey this is unacceptable la, one month liao leh...' I did not talk about the HDDSK because i was not sure. After some discussion, they decided to give me a new HDDSK.<br><br>Members, put yourself in my shoes. What kind of after sales service is this? Furthermore, this is not my PC. I was fixing it for my uncle. I have fixed 4 PCs with no problems at all. Imagine the embarassment i have to face telling my uncle what is going on.<br><br>They NEVER took any prompt action in helping me. They LIED to me about calling me back. They doubted my INTEGRITY and accused me of using PIRATED SOFTWARE!!! They hid the truth by saying they don't have in stock and will send in for servicing. And their hardware got so many problems!!! Bros and sis out there, have you heard of any PC that takes ONE MONTH TO FIX?!?!?!?!<br><br>Look, i am just a student, and not from any other shops trying to flame this CHEESEPIES PC THEMES!!! No point in wasting my time and lying too. If anyone doubt my words and wish to challenge me, send me a PM and i will prove it to you. Maybe you all won't know how BLOODY PISSED OFF I WAS. But think again, will you want this kind of service and lousy computer parts??? I doubt so. Thank you for your kind attention. I just don't want you all to end up like me.</div>
