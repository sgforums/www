            <div class='col-md body'>Just want to provide some information for people buying and assembling DIY computers.<br><br>1. Check for completeness of your products before leaving the store. For example: The mainboard package usually comes with 1 or 2 SATA cables, PATA cables and 1 floppy drive cable. If it is not in the box, there are 2 possibility:  the retailer took them out or the distributor forget to put them inside.<br><br>2. Discharge your body from static electricity before touching any electronic component. This is to prevent damage to sensitive electronic components while handling them.<br><br>3. While assembling the system, always disconnect or switch off the 240 AC power to the power supply unit.<br><br>4. After completing the PC assembly, check that all connections are connected properly at the RIGHT place before the first power up to the whole system. The wrong voltage supplied to a electronic device has a very high chance of damaging it.<br><br>5. Most mainboard related problems can be solved by just by updating the BIOS firmware of the mainboard. After updating the BIOS, if it does not work, then the mainboard had suffered permanent physical damage and the only thing you can do is to send the mainboard to the DISTIBUTOR for RMA or replacement.<br><br>6. It is always better to sent just the malfunction device to the distributor for servicing/replacement rather than bring the entire CPU set to the retailer for analysis. The distributors have better capabilities in handling malfunction products then the retailers. (For example: If you buy a Nokia phone, it malfunction, do you look for the retailer or sent it to Nokia Service Center?)<br><br>This is just my recommended way of handling DIY computers. Of course, you can always have your own way of doing things, but you are just learning things the hard way.</div>

(kelvin iirc) personally connect for me and test it in front of me. as for the LCD, the young chap from phillips change a new one for me, i tot it's a dead pixel, but it turn out to be a speck of dust trapped in between the panel. nonetheless, the guy called his boss and got it replaced for me.</div>
