Reduce stress with exercise, meditation, hot baths, or reading.<br><br>Try sugar-free gum or candy to help handle your cravings. Drink lots of water and juices.<br><br>You might want to try changing your daily routine as well.<br><br>Try drinking tea instead of coffee, eating your breakfast in a different place, or taking a different route to work.<br><br>Talk to your doctor or nurse about medicines to help you quit.<br><br>Some people have withdrawal symptoms when they quit smoking.<br><br>These symptoms can include depression, trouble sleeping, feeling irritable or restless, and trouble thinking clearly.<br><br>There are medicines to help relieve these symptoms.<br><br>Most medicines help you quit smoking by giving you small, steady doses of nicotine, the drug in cigarettes that causes addiction.<br><br>Talk to your doctor or nurse to see if one of these medicines may be right for you:<br><br>nicotine patch: worn on the skin and supplies a steady amount of nicotine to the body through the skin<br><br>nicotine gum or lozenge: releases nicotine into the bloodstream through the lining in your mouth<br><br>nicotine nasal spray: inhaled through your nose and passes into your bloodstream<br><br>nicotine inhaler: inhaled through the mouth and absorbed in the mouth and throat<br><br>bupropion: an antidepressant medicine that reduces nicotine withdrawal symptoms and the urge to smoke<br><br>varenicline (ChantixÂ™): a medicine that reduces nicotine withdrawal symptoms and the pleasurable effects of smoking<br><br>Be prepared for relapse. Most people relapse, or start smoking again, within the first three months after quitting.<br><br>Don't get discouraged if you relapse.<br><br>Remember, many people try to quit several times before quitting for good.<br><br>Think of what helped and didn't help the last time you tried to quit.<br><br>Figuring these out before you try to quit again will increase your chances for success.<br><br>Certain situations can increase your chances of smoking.<br><br>These include drinking alcohol, being around other smokers, gaining weight, stress, or becoming depressed.<br><br>Talk to your doctor or nurse for ways to cope with these situations.<br><br>Friend,I guess my suggestions will help you in quitting smoking.<br><br>Good luk. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

Acid if legalise, acid attack will hpn and make SPF very busy which they do not wan this and kick themselve on the @ss.. so the best way is to legalise tobacco and earn from the freaking high tax..</div>

Not fair to them right. What's more? Passive smokers take in more toxic compared to smokers.<br><br>Ban smoking!</div></blockquote>Oh why not just ban everything that causes harm to innocent people! Ban vehicles cos the exhaust pollutes the air and causes poisoning. Ban 7th month offerings burning cos it pollutes the air too. Oh and all the ash leftover adds to our already very dusty little city country.<br><br>So there are 'other ways of dealing with stress'? Yes, i do think that is true. However, not everyone enjoys doing healthier alternatives. Sadly, sports and healthy lifestyle isnt very popular in case you havent realised. Because it is not exactly fun for everyone. Just like how not everyone enjoys smoking. Not everyone enjoys healthier alternatives. You cannot force people to deal with things YOUR way. For some people, its calming. For others, its just an enjoyable social activity. Like smoke breaks with friends and meeting new people. There are so many reasons. And so many reasons for you not to judge smokers.<br><br>Unless a smoker purposely blows smoke into your direction so as to irritate/kill you with second hand smoke, sure you may complain and whine and scream "HELP SOMEONE IS OUT TO KILL ME". But most smokers i know try to avoid bothering people. Ie, going to a remote corner to light up, watching wind direction when blowing out smoke, asking if non-smokers mind if they light up. But other than that, i dont believe that its such a dangerous activity so as to mandate a total ban and to justify your overly exaggerated complaints.</div>
