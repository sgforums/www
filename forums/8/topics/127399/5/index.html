            <div class='col-md body'>the purpose of having rules is to make sure that people stay within boundaries.  there is a rule against eating and drinking in buses.  what is there to argue?  if you are hungry eat before travelling.  it is not other people's problem that you are hungry.  no leeway should be given.  MRT has rules against it too.<br><br>what will happened if one is given leeway.  people will start to do it if they think it is all right.  and will start arguing when told not to do so.  people will say 'why he can i cannot?'  there will be many grey areas?<br><br>this reasoning applies to all rules.  unless you have good mitigating factors otherwise there should not be leeways.<br><br>please dont argue for the sake of winning an argument.  and kindly refrain from name callings.<br><br></div>
