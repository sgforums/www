Now they little the place too.  The girl snap back at me say she onli leave the the rubbish there.  When I alight I reminded them to clear the rubbish and they just glare at me.

I take it that firstly they eat, which is wrong.  To put it on the floor is tentamount to littering..  so I open my mouth...  I'm quite sure there are not going to clear it because like I mention why put on the floor and not holding on to it.  The girl had nothing to do while the guy were using the lap top.  BTW from the lap top screen, can see they are polytechnic students that why I assume they are 18 or 19 years old.<br><br>Anyway, I am sure many of us here could have seen rubbish on the bus.  How did all the rubbish come about?  It all started with someone hungry and starting to eat... not everyone is like the guy I mentioned who put it away in his bag... goto to go.. nice chatting with you ,.. good nite..</div></blockquote>I don't know which part of Singapore you live in but all the buses I've taken so far, I've not seen any trash inside.And if someone were to tell me to throw away something while I'm drinking or still eating, I'll certainly tell you in no uncertain terms to shut up.If you see me throwing it on the floor, then you are right in reminding me, if not , please sit down and enjoy the nice wonderful TV Mobile.<br><br>I'm quite curious, were you driving for a long time and have not really taken public transport till very recently?</div>

I take it that firstly they eat, which is wrong.  To put it on the floor is tentamount to littering..  so I open my mouth...  I'm quite sure there are not going to clear it because like I mention why put on the floor and not holding on to it.  The girl had nothing to do while the guy were using the lap top.  BTW from the lap top screen, can see they are polytechnic students that why I assume they are 18 or 19 years old.<br><br>Anyway, I am sure many of us here could have seen rubbish on the bus.  How did all the rubbish come about?  It all started with someone hungry and starting to eat... not everyone is like the guy I mentioned who put it away in his bag... goto to go.. nice chatting with you ,.. good nite..</div></blockquote>nothing wrong if you want to tell pple off if they eat in the bus it is wrong anyway even if most pple say its acceptable.<br><br>but just to say i was abit pissed(again forgive me if i appeared rude) i guess cos i got do things like put the stuff on the floor first esp if i going to be on the bus for a long time, its more a matter of convenience, but i will always clear my rubbish i think the difference is the way the rubbish is left bah, if they just throw it under the seat the prob they should be litter but if they put it under then not sure at least to me. nothing to do or hold is not really a good guage in my books since as i said its for convenience like, if you are on an empty bus its alright if you put you bag on the seat taking up one more seat even though you can easily hold it on your lap.</div>
