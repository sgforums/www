If you look at your earlier post. You started pointing the finger at me first.  I did not reprimand the couple.  I merely told them that they should not eat in the first place and worst to put the rubbish below the seat.  Then they say they put there first.  So I reminded them not to forget their rubbish. Is there anything wrong with the statement?  Do I sound like I was looking for fight.  I feel sad for today society that young adult is behaving like this.  I'm not wrong from all these reply that Singapore is really sick in that many don't understand the need for consideration towards others.

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess all start with parents. No point you advise coz their attitude is wrong too.<br><br>If you don't want your kids to be like dat, start with yourself. I guess this is the only way for you to affect the surroundings.  You cant control other people's kidz, but you can for your own.<br></div>

I take it that firstly they eat, which is wrong.  To put it on the floor is tentamount to littering..  so I open my mouth...  I'm quite sure there are not going to clear it because like I mention why put on the floor and not holding on to it.  The girl had nothing to do while the guy were using the lap top.  BTW from the lap top screen, can see they are polytechnic students that why I assume they are 18 or 19 years old.<br><br>Anyway, I am sure many of us here could have seen rubbish on the bus.  How did all the rubbish come about?  It all started with someone hungry and starting to eat... not everyone is like the guy I mentioned who put it away in his bag... goto to go.. nice chatting with you ,.. good nite..</div>
