I was once approach by a cleaner who saw us eat burger  at the park to clear the rubbish after I finished.  I acknowledge her and say I don't intent to litter... If it is the same case, she can tell me she will do it..  That would have end any misunderstanding... maybe she was taken aback when I talk to her.. But then again, like I say, the way they put the rubbish is like I don't think they got intention to clear..  Actually I waited for a few minutes after they dump the rubbish to tell them.. MAybe next time I try to be more observant and see if there is real intention to litter before I open my mouth... Tks....</div>
