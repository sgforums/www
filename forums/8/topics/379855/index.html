              <p>Unschooling concept by John holt is catching on in the west , going beyond homeschooling meaning no curiculum for the kids..giving more time and empowerment for our children..</p>
              <p>Just imagine no more unrealistic PSLE exams for your kids meant for older teenagers..teaching staff here will be halved giving more money to invest on our young in a changing world.Child led instead of teacher or parent led form of learning:)</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>This type of schooling is applicable only to a very small group of highly educated parents. Most of us are not in the profession of teaching and hence, would not be in the correct mind to transfer knowledge in Primary School subjects to our children. Children must go to school not only for knowledge, but also to mix around socially so as to be able to relate to others around them. I do agree Singapore's Schooling Subjects are getting tougher by the years...all these done to preempt our future generation with the applicable certifications required in their future working environment. In fact, foreigners like the Koreans and Chinese, are flocking to Singapore to adequately provide Primary and Secondary Educations for their children.</p></div>

              <p>This is assuming the parents are responsible, well educated and well informed adults.</p>
              <p>I rather cringed at the possibility of particularly religious parents taking away their children from schools and attempting to homeschool them.</p>
              <p>It's a nice idea, but it's all based on the assumption that the parents are really capable of teaching their children properly to integrate with society. Nice ideas tend to get abused so easily..</p>

              </span></span></span></span></p><p class="style120"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'><span> </span>Today no great advances can 
                  be made, nor can the problems facing us be understood, by anyone who stays 
                  within the borders of one of the present academic disciplines. In each, the 
                  workers are smothered in overspecialization and pedantry. Yet in each the 
                  majority of members are very busy congratulating each other on the wonderful 
                  work they are a ll doing. That is self-deception, for the regular academic 
                  disciplines are now bankrupt, incapable of providing their explanations or 
                  solutions to problems.</span></p>
              <p class="style120"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>The chief group of 
                  discontented are, of course, the students, who grow increasingly restless, 
                  discontented, and alienated because of their recognition of the large-scale 
                  irrelevance of so much of what they have to learn. Within these fields, some 
                  teachers realize, more or less unconsciously, that much is wrong. Yet they feel 
                  that they must go on, and d o so, rationalizing that they have to make a living 
                  somehow, and this is the only way they are equipped to earn what is needed, and, 
                  secondly they assure themselves and their students that the latter must have a 
                  college education.</span></p>
              <p class="style120"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>This latter belief is correct only if the student is 
                  determined to make his living by finding a place in the great and ever-growing 
                  bureaucracies which envelop our world and now overshadow it. But all of these 
                  bureaucracies do their work inefficiently and badly. They look good only if we 
                  accept their own fraudulent bookkeeping. </span></p>
              <p class="style120"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>If a student wants to spend his life e 
                  n-capsulated in the interstices of one of these monstrous structures, I suppose 
                  he does need a college education, not because college prepares him to do their 
                  work but simply because these structures increasingly demand a college degree as 
                  a ticket of admission to their employ. They demand that only because it 
                  indicates that the, holder of that ticket h as submitted to years of 
                  brainwashing in irrelevancies and will put up with the myths of the bureaucracy 
                  he joins.</span></p>
              <p class="style121"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'> </span></p>
              <p class="style121"><strong> <span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'> Self-Education</span></strong></p>
              <p class="style120"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>If a young 
                  man today simply wants to make a very good living associated with freedom and 
                  variety, he can do it much better without a college education. Of course he must 
                  be educated, but real education today can he obtained much m ore easily 
                  (although it is never easy) in constant attendance at a good public library than 
                  at the so-called "best” universities (which are frequently the worst 
                  ones). Today, as almost never before, the way lies open to any enterprising 
                  young man to find something to do which is now being done badly or not done at 
                  all by our bureaucratized society.</span></p>
              <p class="style120"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>To do this the first task of the young man 
                  must be to dismiss as the myth it is what passes for truth in existing 
                  universities. There is a truth and it can be found; it has been found, to some 
                  degree, by men in the past, and by men in other societies. The task of finding 
                  it is lifelong, and probably continues after bodily death, and the greatest joy 
                  of living is the search for it. That is why we are here, but to find it in the 
                  accepted wisdom of the existing academic structure is to put oneself in an 
                  intellectual prison, which does not help.</span></p>
              <p class="style120"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Of course, if someone can go 
                  to college and not become a prisoner of its myths and can continue free from the 
                  bureaucratic structure toward which the average college seeks to direct 
                  students, he can also live a good life and, like a
                  <span> </span>non-college man, get rewards greater, 
                  even in material things, than the average college-bureaucracy-tied person. And 
                  in addition, like Ralph Nader, he will be able to keep his freedom and 
                  self-respect, which is worth something.</span></p>

              <p>Yes, I'm an advocate of free education, which is aplenty and all you need to do is research, hard work, research and hard work -- unfortunately, in our comfortale lives and constant stress on paper chase, most of us aren't better off in search of education and knowledge on our own. That's why schools and teachers exists.</p>
              <p>I'd love to give my kids, if I had any, some homeschooling, but only if there's time and plenty of extremely high quality freelance tutors, as well as like-minded parents, in which case my child will be part of a group of homestudy students. A group, so that there's interaction and teamwork.</p>
              <p>Can it work? Theoretically, yes and why not? </p>
              <p>Will it work? Probably not in this generation.</p>

              <p>The ills of modern society like debt monetary system and employment practices (12hr shift 6 day work week) all goes back to the source of industrial based educational system.</p>
