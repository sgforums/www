            <div class='col-md body'>im just wondering when exactly if ever do the gals realise that their boyfriends are actually arseholes. Please sometimes i wish gals didnt put their total fate and life in the hands of their bfriends cos well its silly. I mean do the gals ever think for themselves did they ever stop to ask : 'why am i comprimising myself for someone who i feel doesnt liek me or may be not liking me ?<br>should i even be with this guy????????'<br>Does that happen much? i dont know comments would be appreciated . I believe teh boyfriends have a great responsibility to well not make use of any other ppl jsut for sex, or money or anythign for that matter.<br>BUT i also believe that gals yes gals jsut liek guys have the responsibility to take care of themselves, cos well basically ( and this is for everyone both guys and gals) if u dont respect urself and are constantly comprimising urself jsut to make someone else happy<br>1. when exactly were u planning on making urself happy<br>2. if u dont have selfrespect how and why exactly did u think that other ppl were going to respect u in the first place?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yet, think about it in this way. If you're not considered among the more.... "pleasant" looking part of the percentage, sex is indeed, a tool of sorts for them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> (In a manner of speaking.) Pyschologically, its a sorta mental reassurance thing that "if you're willing to keep having sex with the guy, he'll never leave you" or "I gave it to him, so he has an obligation to stay mine." sorta mentality.<br><br>I had a senior in school once (She sorta disappeared from contact for a long while. Haven't heard from her in a long time now.) who was... to put it bluntly, heavily obese. Well.... lets put the situation simply as being a person who was lonely, and in need of a bf.<br><br>Well..... she had a string of bfs along the way, and each lasted for a while. She did it with <strong>EVERY</strong> one of them. Yet, almost inevitably, the guy would dump her after he had his thrill. And that's when she would go haywire, cutting herself with penknives, trying to suicide, taking anti-depressants, and going to a pyschologist.<br><br>Then after a month or so of stability, she would suddenly announce to the whole wide world that she's happily attached, and that this would work out. Then the cycle repeats itself. Half the time, the bf finds out that she's slept with guys before them, they get disgusted, and dump her.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Of course, that's not to say that Sex is totally a tool. People do it for love, but others do it just for the sake of doing it. Others use it as a means to an end. It varies with different people. I guess the mentality now is that when girls do give themselves to the guy, its mainly due to the misconception of "this relationship will last till marriage."  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Not to mention that those in love can't think clearly half the time when they're together.......  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>------------------<br>"A Gentleman is not an implement."<br>-Confucius, Analects, 2:12</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think it's a sad fact of life that some girls are doing it becos of low self-esteem. They're easy to spot and even easier for unscrupulous people to take advantage of. And when the guy dumps them, they'll feel worse about themselves. I feel sorry for these girls even though I don't think they should have done it.<br><br>And sadly, a 'hard knock on the head' won't wake up their ideas. It just perpetuates the vicious cycle. After the girl gets dumped, she feels worse about herself so she sleeps with another guy to feel better, the guy leaves, she feels even worse so she sleeps with yet another guy to feel better...... It's exactly like the story of that obese girl.<br><br>So how do we help them? I think we need to give them some counselling and sex education<br><br>It's stupid to think that you can keep a guy with sex. For some people (applies to both sexes), it's just a physical act with no emotional weight attached. Sex shouldn't be used to PROOF your love because it doesn't necessarily equal love. Instead, it should be something to CONFIRM your love AFTER it has been proven. Only then would it be meaningful, a true act of 'making love'. (How can you make love when you're not even sure there is love in the first place?)<br><br>Anyway, the harder you try to cling to a person (whether thru sex or something else) the more the other person will want to get away.<br><br>Also, sex is just one aspect of a relationship. It won't cover up flaws in other parts of your relationship. If he is an immature or self-centered person, sex will not change a thing about him or the way he treats you.<br><br>For relationships that are already cracked in the first place, sex will hasten its break-down.<br><br>Bottomline is, it's disatrous to have sex with a guy just to keep him. It may just make things worse.</div>
