            <div class='col-md body'>May 12th Declaration<br><br>In these bright and beautiful days of May, we are beginning a hunger strike.  We are young, but we are ready to give up our lives.  We cherish life; we do not want to die.<br><br>But this nation is in a critical state.  It suffers from sky-rocketing inflation, growing crime rates, official profiteering, and other forms of bureaucratic corruption, concentration of power in a few people's hands, and the loss of a large number of intellectuals who would now rather stay overseas.  At this life-and-death moment of the nation's fate, countrymen, please listen to us!<br><br>China is our motherland.<br><br>We are the people.<br><br>The government should be our government.<br><br>Who should speak out, if we should not?<br><br>Who should act, if we should not?<br><br>Although our bones are still forming, although we are too young for death, we are ready to leave you.  We must go; we are answering the call of Chinese history. Our honest feelings of patriotism and loyalty to the nation were distorted as "turmoil," and we were accused of being the tools of a "handful" who have "ulterior motives".<br><br>We ask of every Chinese citizen- every worker, peasant, soldier, civilian, celebrity, every government official, policeman, and our accusers- that you place your hand on your heart nd ask yourself: What wrong have we done?  What "turmoil" have we created?  What causes have led us to protest, to demonstrate, to boycott classes, to fast, to hide ourselves?  Why did this happen? Our words were not heard in good faith.  We were beaten by police when we marched, though we were only hungry for the truth. Our representatives knelt for hours, presenting our petition, only to be ignored by the government.  Our request for dialogue has been put off again and again. The safety of our student leaders is now uncertain.<br><br>What shall we do?<br><br>Democracy is supposed to be the highest of human aspirations and freedom a sacred human right, granted at birth.  Today these must be bought with our lives. We say to our dear mothers and fathers, do not feel sorry for us when we are hungry.  To our uncles and aunts, do not feel sad when we leave this life.  We have one wish, that the lives of everyone we leave be better.  We have one request, that you remember this: our pursuit is life, not death.  Democracy is not a task for a few; it takes generations.<br><br>May this declaration, written with our lives, break up the clouds that cast their shadows on the People's Republic of China.  We are doing this:<br><br>1. To protest the government's indifference to the student demonstrations;<br><br>2. To protest the government's failure to enter into a dialogue with students;<br><br>3. To protest the government's unfair characterization of the students democratic movement as "turmoil" and the further distortion of it in newspaper coverage.<br><br>We request:<br><br>1. An immediate dialogue between the government and the students on substantial topics with equal status;<br><br>2. An acknowledgment of the legitimacy of the student democratic movement.<br><br>Time of the hunger strike: Begins at 2:00 P.M., May 13, 1989.  Place of the hunger strike: Tiananmen Square. -The hunger-strike volunteers<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The May 16 Declaration<br><br>In the minds of the Chinese people, the "May 16 Notice" of 1966 was undoubtedly a symbol of tyranny and darkness.  Today, twenty-three years later, we strongly sense the call of democracy and a bright future.  A patriotic and democratic movement with the students in the vanguard is emerging throughout the nation...This is a great, historic turning point that will determine the fate of China...<br><br>At this decisive moment, we - the mainland and overseas Chinese intellectuals - have chosen this day, May 16, 1989 to sign the declaration below, which partly articulates our principles and positions:<br><br>1. It is our view that actions taken by certain government and Party leaders have been unwise with regard to the current student movement.  Not long ago there were indications from the government that force would be used to deal with the student movement.  It is worthwhile to reflect on the lessons of history: the Beijing movement of 1919, the Koumingtang government the 1930'a and 1940's, the Gang of Four in the late 1970's and other dictatorships, all used violence to suppress student movements.  Without exception, those who were responsible were labeled "historical disgraces".  History proves: suppressors if student movements come to no good end.  Were the rules of modern democratic politics applies, the will of the people respected, and current trends followed, a democratic and stable China would emerge. Otherwise, a China full of hope would be drawn into an abyss of great turmoil.<br><br>2. The unavoidable first step in handling the political crisis democratically is the recognition of the legality of the autonomous student organizations, which were created through a democratic process.  If not, it would be a violation of the provision of freedom of assembly set forth in the constitution. Branding student organizations as illegal would only intensify and aggravate the crisis.<br><br>3. The direct cause of this political crisis if the phenomenon of corruption, which the young students have spoken out against so strongly during this movement.  The greatest mistake of the past ten years is a neglect to reform the political structure...The leaders should respect the demands of the people, promote systematic political reform, out an end to special privilege, investigate and ban "official racketeering", and eliminate corruption.<br><br>4. During the student movements, news organs, such as Xinhua News Agency and the People's Daily, concealed the facts, depriving people of their right to know; the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party suspended the duties if Qin Benli, editor in chief of the World Economic Herald.  These erroneous actions represent an utter disregard for our constitution.  Freedom of the press is an effective method of routing out corruption, maintaining national stability, and promoting social development,  Absolute power that is not subject to supervision inevitable leads to absolute corruption,  When freedom of the press is not put into effect, if the people are not allowed to establish and run newspapers, then all of the wishes and promises concerning liberalization and reform will result in nothing more than a blank sheet of paper,<br><br>5. It is wrong to call this student movement an anti-Party, anti-Socialist political insurrection. The fundamental meaning of freedom of speech is to acknowledge and even protect the citizen's right to express different political views.  The essence of the various political movements since the liberation- the Anti-Hu Feng movement, the Anti-Rightist movement, the Cultural Revolution, the Anti-Spiritual Pollution movement and the Anti-Bourgouisie Liberalization campaign- has been to put pressure on and attack different  political views.  A society with only one voice is inherently unstable.  It is necessary for the Party and the government to review the profound lessons of these movements.  Opening all channels of speech, consulting with student, intellectual, and all people on affairs of state is the only way possible to create a stable, and unified political system.<br><br>6. The idea of "a handful of" or of "long beard" backstage manipulators is wrong,  Regardless of age, all citizens of the People's Republic of Chine hold an equal political position and have the right to participate and to discuss politics.  Freedom, democracy, and legality have never been granted.  All the people who pursue truth and love should make untiring efforts to attain freedom of thought, of speech, and of the press and the right to gather, organize, march. and demonstrate which are garunteed to every citizen by the constitution. Our nation has not time to lose and can no longer turn back.<br><br>Chinese intellectuals, you are full of patriotism and conscience,  Realize your unshirkable historic responsibility and stand out to advocate the democratic process.  Fight for establishing a modern nation with political democracy and a flourishing economy!<br><br>Long live the people!<br><br>Long live a free and democratic China!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>May 1989<br><br>The second petition of the students was ineffective, so demonstration recommenced. When the government ordered an end to these protests only some of the students complied. In the afternoon of May 13, several hundred students began a hunger strike at Tian An Men Square. They continued for another day and the government finally conceded. This talk did not succeed, however, and twelve of China's most famous writers and scholars presented their emergency appeals at the Square, calling the government to give these students just treatments; their efforts failed. By the third day of the hunger strike, more and more people began to sympathize with the students and they gathered around the Square.<br><br>For the next two days, the number of students, who fainted in the hunger strike increased to 600; some had even stopped drinking water. In addition, more people from all over China, many of whom were not students, marched to the Square to show their support. Even local businesses supported the students, donating basic supplies.<br><br>On May 12, the students issued the May 2 Declaration proclaiming their hunger strike. They issued another declaration on the 16 fittingly called the May 16th Declaration.<br><br>Even more people filled the Square the next day, both to support and to watch the students. The Beijing Youth Newspaper took a poll of bystanders and participants.<br><br>A day later, Chinese leaders met with student leaders including Wu'er Kaixi and Wang Dan. Although this talk was televised to the nation nothing was accomplished. The next day, May 19, the student leaders heard that the government would use martial law to end all this. They dedided to call off the hunger strike but started a sit in. Martial law was institued the next day.<br><br>Military troops entered the city but were unable to clear Tian An Men Square on account of the amount of people that were there. After many failed attempts in trying to enter the city, the military retreated to the borders of Beijing on May 23. That day, a group of students splattered Mao's portrait with ink. They were captured and jailed. The Tian An Men Square Site Headquarter was formed on May 24 and Chai Ling was named the Commander-in-Chief. The purpose of theAlliance to Protect the Constitution, formed on the 23, was to watch over the actions of the various groups during this movement. They recommended that the students leave the Tian An Men Square by May 30, but the Site Headquarter refused to do so. On May 30, a statue of the Goddess of Democracy was placed in Tian An Men Square.<br></div>
