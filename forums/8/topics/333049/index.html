            <div class='col-md body'><p>It was a fine sunny saturday evening. I was invited to my colleagues BBQ party at East Coast Park. It was 4:35pm, i got dressed in a NUM singlet, billabong board shorts n havaianas flip flops. My favorite chill out weekend attire.<br><br><br>I started my suzuki swift n headed to ECP via the KPE expressway, n i called up my colleague, Jack, the organizer of the venue. He told me to head to carpark D n go to pit 45A.<br><br><br>So i finally reached carpark D after a long drive. I brought along a bag of codfish wrapped in foil, since each person was to contribute an item to the BBQ. The surroundings was quite unfamiliar to me as i seldom come to East Coast Park. Now i just needed to head to the correct pit. I looked around, i don't seem to see any pit starting with no. 40. Damn! I saw this young girl in a tight tank top n short denim shorts struggling with bags of food, probably BBQ foodstuffs. She seemed to be struggling with the heavy load of stuffs that she didn't see an oncoming bicycle in her direction. I was near her, i shouted 'Watch out!!' n pointed at the oncoming bicycle.<br><br><br>She gasped, stop dead in her tracks, n dropped her bags. i got to her n said 'you ok??, its quite dangerous along these bicycle paths, lots of cycling especially since its a weekend'. She said 'Thanks for saving my life! if u hadn't shouted i would've got knocked down by that bicycle!' Just then, many fishballs or squid balls rolled outta her bag n landed on the bicycle path! Then they all kenna squished by the cyclists n rollerbladers. End up all become roadkill siah.<br><br><br>She cried 'OH MY GOD! my foodstuffs! oh no, i promised my friends i will bring some food n now they are all roti-prata-ed!...****'<br>i said 'oh no worries, here, u can have some of my foodstuffs, i'm also going to a BBQ party'<br><br><br>i asked her wheres BBQ pit 45A, she said its probably up ahead, quite a distance away since its all no. 30s pit around here. I chatted with her as we walked towards her BBQ pit. She sounded very grateful to me for saving her life. LOL, i didn;'t really saved her life, i just shouted a warning thats all. She's quite pretty, slim body, sweet personality n polite. I reached her friends BBQ party, got 4 other girls, all also quite chio. I passed her some of my codfish n she seemed very grateful. I saw one of her friends struggling to get the BBQ fire going, therefore i offered a helping hand. I succeeded in getting a steady fire within just a few mere minutes. They were all impressed by my skills n i also taught them the proper way of starting a BBQ fire.<br><br><br>I chatted with the girl, her name was Cindy, since she offered me a drink. I asked her, "your friends, all girls? no guys?". She said yeah, she mostly hang out with her all girls pals... I learnt that she was a student at a tertiary instituition along Clamenti Rd, studying business management in her 2nd year. I remarked to her i was also a student there, i graduated 2 years ago with a 2nd class honours Bachelor of Science in Business. Later i learnt she was single, n her hobbies r hanging out with her female pals, singing kbox, shopping, yoga n gym. I asked for her no, she gave it to me! <br><br><br>I baded farewell n quickly headed to my company BBQ. i apologized for my lateness n said i was helping out some girls start a BBQ fire. They LOL at me n didn't seem to believe me. The BBQ then went smoothly, we had food n chatted n played Dai-dee n joked about our office lives n our boss etc.<br><br><br>There was many leftover food, therefore i took some n tahpow n excused myself. I went back to Cindy's BBQ pit n offered her n her friends some food. I sat down n chit-chatted with them, n later i remarked its quite late. have to go home. I think i had a fancy on Cindy, she seems like a perfect girlfriend. I was single, she was too, so there seem to be opportunities for a r'ship. Out of earshot of her friends, i offered Cindy a ride back to her home, n she agreed. <br><br><br>So we left together, n in the car, i asked if she would like to drop by my house. I told her i live alone in a small apartment. She sounded interested, n so off we headed there. i brought her back to my apartment, n opened a bottle of wine to share between ourselfs. <br><br><br>later, we found ourselves attracted to each other, in a very romantic way. I brought her back to my room n we made love there! ETC ETC (sorry u have to imagine urself all the details, cant write too much or else thread will kenna deleted. ) <img class="inlineimg" title="Embarrassment" src="http://www.hardwarezone.com/img/forums/styles/hwz/smilies/redface.gif" border="0" alt=""><br><br><br>We fell asleep holding each others hands, n i sent her back to her house in the morning. Subsequently, i asked her out for a date n later on, we went steady....</p></div>
