It usually take a long time to find a job....esp if you do not have any work experience. You might feel that your diploma results are putting you at a disadvantage.<br><br>Maybe you should start looking for an audit job and at the same time enrolling for ACCA. Some local audit firms do accept diploma graduates.  The reason why it is difficult to look for an accounting job is there are tens of thousands of people (including FTs) with accounting qualification looking for the same limited accounting/auditing jobs.<br><br>As for your interview techniques, maybe you can consult a recruitment agency to brush up your interview skills.<br><br>All the best in your career.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>See it this way:<br><br>Where can you go with an O Level cert? Fair enough, there have been success stories of people who made it with few certs and qualifications. However, if you ask them, they'd tell you that the walking the road for them was an uphill task for them, and they faced all sorts of obstacles and hardships along the way.<br><br>A few MNCs rejecting you does not mean that you wasted all your time in poly. All it means is that you need to rethink your plans and to adapt. You can always start working with a small company and start at a lower position, and then slowly make your own way up. It's all a matter of whether or not you are willing to work hard from the bottom.<br><br>I've personally heard of a couple of cases of people who want to go to poly but cannot do so because they either can't qualify for it or can't afford it. So really, your end of the stick isn't that short at all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>bro, what you learn back in sch you'll probaly apply less than 10% of it in your working career. take a good look at yourself. you're being categorized under the below avg group if i must say. 15 points for Os you probaly just manage to get into Accounting. 5B's? and the rest are C and D's? (sorry if it sounds offensive here)<br><br>you're now living in the 21st century bro. everything's moving. nobody's gonna wait for you. you try entering army with just O'lvl la. you probaly post a thread here saying how badly you kenna tekan by your sergeants. sign on? sure. for how many years? afterwhich? start business? be security guard? you have absolutely NO future kae. people who sign on NS are probaly the ones who don't really know where to go after they ORD or are in need of money to support the family. rarely people sign on based on interest.<br><br>i can understand how you feel. being rejected and all. why don't you do something to improve yourself? from what you've been saying about you scoring low marks for Accounting, i guess its only feasible if you should pursue your degree on a different course. and bro nothing is easy to study in poly. you ask around you tell me which person says, "eh my course damn easy. no need study also can score well" if you really wanna pursue and be an accountant, you could take up ACCA and afterwhich you can carry on with your CPA. trust me afterwhich your chances of being accepted in a MNC company would be higher. having degrees and such are just stepping stones to get you further in the working society. its not an admission ticket.<br><br>i just hope you can wake up your idea and realise what you just posted. if you don't want to help yourself, no one else can. all we can do is advice you on what to do. whether you want to follow is up to you. and i wish u luck with your upcoming job interviews  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

That motivates me to complete a fast degree. To me, there is no point waste another 3 - 4 years taking a Degree course, which took me 1 and half years only. hehe<br><br>As what others had say, Degree is just a stepping stone. NS is a good time to think about what you want in your life. You have 2 years time to think about it. At the same time, look for other opportunities out there before you ORDED.<br><br>Give yourselves plenty of options! if one of the options went wrong, HOP on to the other! you must always prepare for PLAN B!<br><br>I wish you BEST of luck! and You better start thinking!<br><br></div>

None of the subjects I got A.<br><br>Than I went into ns and completed in oct 07.<br><br>Now is my 1st full time job. I wanted to find a accounts job but couldn't find as all the companies say that I got no experience. They don't want to even give me a chance as if having no experience is a crime.<br><br>Although now I have a job and I am being paid a diploma graduate salary, but I feel that my this job is pretty easy and even O level graduates could do it.<br><br>So i regretted studying a diploma. If I could turn back in time, I will have chosen to go ns after my O level and than start working.</div></blockquote>that's when you're totally wrong.<br><br>if you just have an O level.<br><br>your starting pay will not be the same like what you are drawing now.<br><br>major companies have their reasons for getting people with experience when it comes to accounting.<br><br>1- they saves time (needed to train up the person)<br>2- lesser risk of the person committing mistakes<br>3- they can give the person multiple projects to take on<br>4- they have the connections..when it comes to auditing and need help etc..<br>5- they can handle the pressure well enough..<br><br>there are a lot of many other good reasons why experience counts..<br>but not all industries relies on people with experience.<br><br>don't dream of working and earning lots of money by being accountant.<br>it takes time and experience to grow yourself.</div>

No way... i haf friends who are DIP holders.... starting pay... 1.8k.... den if at 1st.. u did not regret.. i bet u r regretting at here bah...<br><br>3rd: Experience??? u cant say too much abt it lor... everyone is not born a Bill Gates... everyone did not know how to walk when they are born... so we haf to learn... start wif a small company... gained the exp from there... den when u had opportunities come knocking on ur door.. do some hopping...<br><br>Live life without regrets... this is the most important!</div>
