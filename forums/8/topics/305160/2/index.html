Unless you have the ambition, plans, sources, contacts, ideas and financial support to start a business, your future is limited...<br><br>Even if you sign on in the army, it is hard for you to even raise to the rank of a staff sergeant because you have just an O level cert.<br><br>And one thing you should learn in life... Don't regret over what has been done... There are too many things for one to achieve in life, and a truly successful person will be one who will make do with what he/she has and what he/she has gone through, to rise above and soar.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm opposite, I regretted not study well. If I could turn back the time, I'd rather get good grade for my PSLE and probably end myself up in Express stream, then probably now in JC or Poly, instead of ITE.<br><br>It sucks, when I regret now. So TS, please don't regret, cos, in-order for me to get a bloody diploma cert. It will take me a good five years.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>with your dip, i think you will get some exemptions for acca...that is if you want to do accounting...otherwise go get a degree, you will also get exemptions for relevant subjects....unless you run your own firm or become an agent in real estate of insurance, the more education you have the more you will earn...that's for sure....but if you have to compete with cheaper ft, then good luck...</div>
